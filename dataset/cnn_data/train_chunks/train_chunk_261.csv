"(CNN) -- Police shot and wounded an armed man at a Milwaukee-area children's hospital's neonatal intensive care floor late Thursday morning, authorities said. Milwaukee police had gone to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to arrest the man on a felony warrant and found him holding a child in the intensive care unit, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke told reporters. Instead of surrendering, the man took out a handgun and fled down a hallway, prompting police to shoot him. ""When he was first approached, he put the baby down and he acted as if he was going to go along peacefully,"" Clarke said. ""And it wasn't until a couple of seconds later that he bolted."" Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said the man continued to struggle with officers even after being shot in the arm. No one else was injured, he said. Clarke said the officers didn't know the suspect's relationship to the child or whether the man -- who was wanted on a weapons charge --was armed when they first encountered him. He said the Milwaukee Police Department would investigate its officers' use of force, but told reporters it was too early to be ""second-guessing"" them for opening fire inside the hospital. ""These things rapidly evolve and you're going to do in your best judgment what you think is necessary to get these violent indivduals in custody, and it doesn't always go according to Hoyle,"" he said, referring to a strict rulebook for games. He added, ""I'll tell you a better question, though: What's this idiot doing in a neo-natal care unit with a handgun?"" The hospital is located in Wauwatosa, a few miles west of Milwaukee. It was locked down because of the incident, but an all-clear was posted by mid-afternoon, the facility posted on Twitter. CNN was first alerted to the incident by Twitter posts from CNN affiliates.","Police wound wanted man in Milwaukee hospital .

"(Mashable) -- There are no rules to naming a startup. And most entrepreneurs do assume that the name they choose will change before their businesses really start to gain momentum. Consequently, it doesn't shock us that some of our favorite startups were sired by picking names out of hats, by throwing out odd proper nouns that might be cheap domain names and by haphazardly removing vowels. Ever wonder what a ""Twitter"" is, or who the ""Hipmunk"" is? We've asked nine startups to share the story behind their names. 1. Twitter . The name Twitter was picked out of a hat. A small group of employees from Odeo, the San Francisco podcasting startup where Twitter initially began, had a brainstorming session. They were trying to come up with names that fit with the theme of a mobile phone buzzing an update in your pocket. After narrowing down the options (which included Jitter and Twitter), they wrote them down, put them in a hat, and let fate decide. Fate decided on Twitter (because clearly asking someone if they saw your latest ""jeep"" is just weird). 2. Foursquare . Dodgeball, Dennis Crowley's first attempt at social networking for mobile phones, was acquired by Google in 2005. When Google killed the project, Crowley founded an improved location-based social game he named Foursquare. Does Dennis Crowley have some sort of unresolved childhood issues relating to playground games? As it turns out, no he doesn't. ""Dennis chose to name both companies after playground games because they were both designed to be fun and playful,"" said Foursquare's PR manager in an email. Apparently, Foursquare was always Crowley's first choice, but the domain name wasn't available at the time he founded Dodgeball. 3. Aardvark . Aardvark has been a sleek website where users can type or email their questions, to then be answered by the appropriate people in their own social networks. But co-founder Max Ventilla's idea began as a chat buddy that could intermediate conversations with people you know online. There were advantages to having this name at the top of the buddy list, a spot which was occupied on Ventilla's buddy roster by his friend Aaron. Alphabetically speaking, there aren't many options that trump Aaron. ""Aardvark"" is one of the few names that could shoulder him out. Other factors the name had going for it were its ability to conjugate the invented active verb ""vark,"" and being an animal that people recognized but typically didn't have strong associations with. ""We also felt that an animal had the right positioning as helpful but not perfect,"" said Ventilla in an email. ""If we chose a human or a robot mascot people would spend their time trying to make it look stupid, but they'd cut an animal more slack."" Google recently announced it would soon shutter Aardvark. Users have until September 30 to retrieve their data. 4. Spotify . Spotify founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon crossed ""spot"" and ""identify"" when they named their digital music service. 5. Twilio . ""In the early days of the company, the name doesn't really matter for anything. You always assume you'll change it later...You should be able to own a word for your company. You should not have any baggage associated with the name. ""What we started doing is saying, we want to invent a word, we know that, so let's just start making syllables without faces and when we have something that sounds good, check and see if the domain name is available ... We'd just make these weird sounds and then run to the computer and see if it was available. We bought the domain name for $7."" 6. Zynga . Zynga is named after CEO Mark Pincus's late American Bulldog, Zinga. The name means African warrior princess. 7. Etsy . From a spokesperson: . The origin of the word ""Etsy"" is shrouded in mystery. Only our founder Rob Kalin knows for sure, and he often throws out red herrings. Some widely-publicized (and certainly fabricated) versions of the story include: a reference to a magic word in a Fellini film, the name of his grandmother's favorite childhood pet, and something about a Unix directory, I think it's ""/etc,"" pronounced ""et-C."" Other fun facts (some of which may actually be factual): Phonetically, Etsy has many homonyms too. It can mean: . -- ""and if"" in Latin . -- ""horny"" in Japanese . -- A slur for ""loose woman"" in Russian-speaking parts of Bay Ridge / Brighton Beach . -- Oh, and it rhymes with ""Betsy."" 8. Scribd . Scribd CEO Trip Adler says the company picked Scribd (pronounced ""skribbed"") beause of its ties to writing and publishing. More interesting is how the coppany decided on the name of its mobile reader app, Float. ""We wanted something to highlight the floating reading experience,"" Adler says. ""Namely, the idea of reading without boundaries."" 9. Hipmunk . After discarding names like ""BouncePounce"" (if there were a good travel deal, you'd pounce, right?) and Truvel (travel, but true), Hipmunk co-founder Adam Goldstein was discussing the naming roadblock with his girlfriend. She suggested they go with a cute animal so that they could have a cool logo. Hipmunk.com was auctioning for about $70 at a time, and so the name -- and admittedly adorable logo -- were born.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Nearly 6.2 million students in the United States between the ages of 16 and 24 in 2007 dropped out of high school, fueling what a report released Tuesday called ""a persistent high school dropout crisis."" A new report on high school dropouts in the United States calls for a national re-enrollment strategy. The total represents 16 percent of all people in the United States in that age range in 2007. Most of the dropouts were Latino or black, according to a report by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, and the Alternative Schools Network in Chicago, Illinois. ""Because of the widespread, pressing nature of the crisis and the large numbers of young people who have already dropped out, a national re-enrollment strategy should be a fundamental part of America's national education agenda,"" the report says. However, the report notes, the ""absence of new funding at the federal and state level since the 1980s has led to decades of disinvestment in re-enrollment programs across the country."" Despite the funding cutbacks, there have been re-enrollment successes nationally and in a number of cities including Chicago; Los Angeles, California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Portland, Oregon, the report says. ""These programs have found that young people who have left high school before earning a diploma are not dead-end dropouts, but often are in fact students waiting and looking for opportunities to re-enroll and finish high school,"" the study says. ""The most successful programs are small (80-150 students), offering comprehensive after-school and summer activities, led by experienced principals and teachers, focused on learning in the real world, well-funded with local school site program and fiscal control, and track specific, measurable outcomes for student achievement including skill gains, enrollment, attendance, credit gains, promotions and graduations."" Jesse Williams, 22, was one of those dropouts who is now working on her degree. She said a street shooting in which one friend died and two were wounded was the start of her losing interest in school. ""My junior year I dropped out,"" she said at a summit in Washington on Tuesday. ""Too much gang violence, teachers discriminating because of the color of my skin, or where I come from."" Now re-enrolled in a Chicago school dedicated to bringing dropouts back to education, Williams said, ""They help me in my classwork. I have a mentor that checks up on me monthly. She goes to my house, sees if there's anything that I need."" Researchers for the study analyzed the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Surveys, household data from the Current Population Survey, national data on GED certificate awards and other official sources to examine the problem at the national level and in the nation's 12 largest states: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. Men and blacks and Hispanics of both genders are among those particularly prone to dropping out of high school. ""As these data show, this dropout crisis is disproportionately affecting America's communities of color,"" said Marc Morial, president and chief executive officer of the National Urban League. ""Youth from all communities deserve an equal chance at educational success."" Among the findings in the report, ""Left Behind in America: The Nation's Dropout Crisis:"" The dropout situation at the state level was similarly widespread: . The report emphasized the importance of having at least a high school education. ""In the current global economy, having at least a high school diploma is a critical step for avoiding poverty, and a college degree is a prerequisite for a well-paying job,"" the study says. ""The costs of dropping out of high school today are substantial and have risen over time, especially for young men, who find it almost impossible to earn an adequate income to take care of themselves and their families."" The report goes on to note: ""Americans without a high school diploma have considerably lower earning power and job opportunities in today's workforce. Over a working lifetime from ages 18-64, high school dropouts are estimated to earn $400,000 less than those that graduated from high school. For males, the lifetime earnings loss is nearly $485,000 and exceeds $500,000 in many large states. Due to their lower lifetime earnings and other sources of market incomes, dropouts will contribute far less in federal, state and local taxes than they will receive in cash benefits, in-kind transfers and correctional costs. Over their lifetimes, this will impose a net fiscal burden on the rest of society. ""By contrast, adults with high school diplomas contribute major fiscal benefits to the country over their lifetime. The combined lifetime fiscal benefits -- including the payment of payroll, federal, and state income taxes --- could amount to more than $250,000 per graduated student. Such a public fiscal benefit more than outweighs the estimated cost of enrolling a student who has dropped out.""","Newly released study examines rates of high school dropouts .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United manager David Moyes says he and his slumping team are ""desperate"" to turn things around -- and hopes the reversal of fortune begins in the Champions League. The defending Premier League champion didn't lose any ground in the title race -- although repeating was already looking unlikely -- but the Red Devils did slip 12 points behind a Champions League spot after the most recent round of games last weekend. And United wasn't just beaten on Sunday. It was outclassed by arch-rival Liverpool at Old Trafford, 3-0. While Liverpool routinely threatened thanks to the likes of in-form pair Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, United's high-profile duo of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie were never a problem for the Reds' sometimes shaky defense. With Liverpool controlling the midfield, United struggled to gain a foothold and managed just one shot on target. ""The players are capable of turning it around,"" Moyes was quoted as saying by Manchester United's website. ""We're all desperate to put things right and make sure we play better to give the supporters here something to shout about."" The manner of the defeat piled more pressure on Moyes, who is in his first season at the helm at Manchester United after replacing managerial great Alex Ferguson. Former Liverpool defender Alan Hansen said Moyes is ""fighting for his future"" and that if United exited the Champions League against Olympiacos and then lost to Manchester City in the league, ""there will be serious doubts over whether Moyes can continue."" According to British bookmaker William Hill, Moyes is the joint third favorite -- behind West Bromwich Albion's Pepe Mel and Norwich's Chris Hughton -- to become the next Premier League manager to depart. West Bromwich Albion and Norwich are struggling near the relegation zone although West Brom won Saturday at Swansea. Manchester United faces an uphill battle to reach the last eight of this season's Champions League after a 2-0 reverse in Greece: Only once has the team lost a first leg in the competition and advanced -- in 2006/2007 against Roma. But Olympiacos has lost all 11 of its previous encounters in England and United has won all of its home games versus Greek opposition. Given United's position in the Premier League, winning the Champions League might be its most feasible path to appearing in next season's competition. United last failed to compete in the Champions League in 1995/1996. ""We have to go for the throat to get the win,"" said Moyes. ""We won't be gung-ho but we will certainly go with a mindset to overhaul the deficit as quickly as we can. ""We won't be reckless as we could find ourselves with a bigger mountain to climb but we can be forceful. We have to be if we're to keep ourselves in the Champions League."" United midfielder Juan Mata, bought in the January transfer window for a club record $61 million, said United's pedigree in Europe -- it has amassed three titles in Europe's top club competition while Olympiacos has yet to make the semifinals -- could be a factor. ""Everything went bad (against Liverpool),"" Mata wrote in his blog. ""It was a tough defeat and I want to tell you that we will give everything we have in order to forget about this in the remaining games. And there is a very important one around the corner. ""We know the history of this club and its achievements, based on a winning spirit. That is what we need to beat Olympiacos and get through in the Champions League. ""The storm will pass and the sun will rise again,"" the cup-tied Spaniard also said. ""I have no doubt. Besides, no one said this would be easy.""","David Moyes says his slumping team is ""desperate"" to turn things around .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal lost 6-0 to league leader Chelsea in English football's Premier League and it looked like another side from North London would suffer a heavy defeat Sunday when Tottenham fell behind 2-0 to Southampton. But unlike the Gunners on Saturday, Spurs rallied and kept their slim Champions League hopes alive by downing Southampton 3-2 with a dramatic injury-time winner at White Hart Lane. Gylfi Sigurdsson's low shot handed Tottenham all three points and pulled Tim Sherwood's men to within six points of Arsenal in the race for fourth, the final Champions League spot. Sherwood -- who replaced the axed Andre Villas Boas in December -- publicly criticized his team following a 4-0 reverse at Chelsea two weeks ago and Tottenham has since put in better performances, even if it lost to Arsenal last week and was bundled out of the Europa League. ""You know what it took -- guts, character and spirit,"" Sherwood told Sky Sports. ""They know how to dig deep now, they know how to respond, they know how to grind out a result and that's what they did today. ""They know now that capitulations aren't acceptable. ""It wasn't silky, it wasn't fantastic flowing football, but it was effective. We have quality players and when we fight and work for each other, then the quality players show what they can do."" Southampton possesses quality players, too, with the English trio of Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Jay Rodriguez all impressing this season and hoping to be on the plane to Brazil for the World Cup. Rodriguez's good finish after a Kyle Naughton mistake made it 1-0 in the 19th minute and the right back's error also led to Lambert setting up Lallana in the 28th. Christian Eriksen began the comeback in the 31st minute before adding a second in the 46th, just minutes after Sherwood's halftime talk. Sigurdsson, a substitute, settled the affair when it appeared as if the points would be shared. ""We got a little speech at halftime and in the second half we were new guys,"" Eriksen told Sky. In Sunday's other game, Aston Villa -- which defeated Chelsea last week -- lost 4-1 at home to Stoke. Stoke leapfrogged Villa for 10th in the standings.","Tottenham keeps Champions League hopes alive by beating Southampton 3-2 .

"(CNN) -- A house fire in Queens that killed two 4-year-old siblings Sunday was a result of a child or children playing with fire, a Fire Department of New York spokesman said. The early morning fire was ruled accidental, the result of ""child involvement with fire play,"" and the fire department was still investigating which occupants were involved in playing with the fire, according to department spokesman Khalid Baylor. Five people were rescued from the blaze, Baylor said. The fire began in the basement, officials said. Aniya Tinglin and her brother Jai'Launi, both 4, were taken to St. John's Episcopal Hospital, where they died, according to the authorities. Another 4-year-old girl was taken to the same hospital and is in stable condition, said Baylor. The two children who died were half-siblings who shared a father, and the girl who survived was Jai'Launi's twin sister, CNN affiliate WABC reported. A 55-year-old woman and a 63-year-old man were taken to two area hospitals, where they are listed in critical but stable condition. Barbara Smith, a friend of the family, spoke with WABC on Sunday morning and said the family is from Jamaica and that the children were visiting. ""I was shocked. Shocked and frightened. Because it could happen to anyone,"" said Smith. CNN's Morgan Winsor contributed to this report.","Siblings died in blaze that broke out around midnight Saturday, fire official says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Shoes tell a lot about a person. If you stumbled into my closet, you would probably think I was a security guard, a construction worker or a Nurse Ratched wannabe. My taste in shoes tends to be boxy, low-heeled and sturdy. If the equipment isn't cleaned properly, you could be at risk for infection when you get a pedicure. So it probably doesn't surprise you to learn that when it comes to pedicures, I am hardly a nail salon enabler. Unfortunately, in some sort of twisted cosmic comedy, both my teen and my tween daughters are pedicure addicts. To pedicure addicts, there is nothing better than being seated in those massive padded massage chairs, chin deep in fashion magazines, while some woman bathes, chisels, files and paints their toes. And up until now, the only thing I worried about was how much the extra flower motif on her big toe was going to cost me. Now, I have plenty of other stuff to worry about. Dr. Dina Tsentserensky, a podiatrist in New York, made it clear. ""I definitely see patients that have had problems as a result of getting a pedicure,"" she said. ""I guess the most common is fungal nails."" Fungal nails!!! I really don't want to pay for that. The National Institutes of Health, unfortunately, describes fungal nail in less-than-clear terms: Fungal nail infection is an infection of the nails by a fungus. Prescription treatments are only about 50 percent effective, and most of these infections usually require the loss of the infected nail itself, the NIH Web site says. Cuts, scrapes and some other infections are also common results of seemingly soothing foot romps. Tsentserensky thinks it's nothing new. ""I think it's a chronic problem that has been going on for a while,"" she said. ""People just maybe chose to ignore it or don't pay attention as much as they should.""  Health for Her: Watch more on pedicure safety Â» . Anyone who did pay attention could have known about some of those risks eight years ago. That's when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported finding a nasty infection that hit more than 100 pedicure patients. The culprit: a less-than-sterile footbath screen. The result: an infection called mycobacterium fortuitum. That mouthful of a malady left these customers, most of them women, with prolonged boils on their lower legs and some long-term scars. Although that report prompted nail salons to clean the screens on those foot baths more often, it doesn't mean that in the land of pedicure pampering, you can just relax and enjoy the polishing. Tsentserensky's chief advice is to be on high cleanliness alert. ""I tell patients to make sure that the bathtubs are being cleaned properly, that they are using enough time in between so the disinfectant has time to work,"" she said. And the magic timeframe, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, is about 10 minutes between clients. The EPA also stresses that to ensure the safest conditions, the tubs need to be cleaned with an EPA-registered hospital disinfectant, which means the bottle itself will have a EPA registration number listed somewhere on the label. But it's not just the tubs that need to be clean. So do those instruments. ""Make sure that instruments are getting sterilized properly,"" Tsentserensky cautions, ""that they are using a sterilizer or an autoclave to properly sanitize the instruments or using the liquids for the proper periods of time."" Timing is also important, but that's a condition that's on your side. Don't get a pedicure right after you've shaved your legs, had laser hair removal or have any cuts or bites on your legs. Any opening in the skin is an invitation that you might not want to be extending. And finally, make sure you can communicate with your nail technician to ensure he or she is taking the proper precautions to make your pedicure a stress-free experience and, more important, to ensure that the only thing you're taking with you when you leave that salon is the pretty polish.","Some people get fungal nails or infections from pedicures .

"(CNN) -- A bill is headed for the governor's desk in Tennessee that would allow for a woman to be prosecuted if she illegally takes drugs while pregnant and the child is harmed. Known as SB1391, the bill passed both the Senate and the House last week. Once his office receives the legislation, Gov. Bill Haslam will have 10 days, not including Sundays, to act on it. ""We all want to promote healthy pregnancies by providing pregnant women struggling with a drug or alcohol dependency with the opportunity to seek the best possible prenatal care and substance abuse treatment,"" Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, wrote in a letter to Haslam this week. ""However, policies that threaten women with criminal prosecution and the loss of their children drive women away from health care and discourage them from seeking invaluable prenatal and pregnancy-related care. SB1391 is constitutionally unsound and enacting this law would threaten the health and well-being of Tennessee women and their families. We urge you to veto this dangerous legislation."" The governor's office declined to say whether Haslam would sign the bill. ""As with all legislation, the governor will review the bill in its final form before taking action,"" Laura Herzog, a spokeswoman for the governor, said in an e-mail to CNN. She stressed that the current form of the bill includes the following provisions: . -- The charge would be limited to a misdemeanor; . -- An offense would only occur if there is the illegal use of a narcotic drug; . -- Women who seek treatment while they're pregnant and complete the program would not be charged. Such stipulations, however, do not go far enough, according to critics of the bill such as Jeff Teague, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee. ""One of our primary concerns is making sure women have healthy pregnancies and then healthy children, and the big concern here is that this is going to frighten women away from the treatment they need for a healthy pregnancy, as well as treatment for any substance abuse issues that they have. Teague added: ""It's of particular concern in rural areas because there's not enough facilities that have the ability to provide addiction counseling for pregnant women."" Attempts to contact sponsors of the bill -- Sen. Reginald Tate, a Democrat, and Rep. Terri Lynn Weaver, a Republican -- were unsuccessful Thursday. According to the Tennessee Department of Health, more than 900 newborns in Tennessee in 2013 experienced withdrawal from drugs their mothers used while pregnant. The department reports a nearly ten-fold rise in the incidence of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome in Tennessee over the past decade. If the bill becomes law, Tennessee would become the first state to authorize the filing of assault charges when a fetus or newborn is found to be harmed by illegal narcotics, according to a Wednesday op-ed in The New York Times that called for Haslam to veto the legislation. ""He can show he truly cares about protecting pregnant women, children and families by vetoing the bill, as specialists in obstetric medicine and drug addiction, as well as women's rights groups have urged,"" the editorial read. ""As Governor Haslam should see, the measure is about punishing women Ã¢â¬â mainly poor minority women Ã¢â¬â not getting them into treatment or protecting their babies.""","Bill would allow for a woman to be prosecuted if she illegally takes drugs while pregnant .

"(CNN) -- What is it about Woodstock? Jimi Hendrix closed the Woodstock festival on Monday morning, August 18, 1969. The 1967 Monterey Pop Festival was arguably more influential and, like Woodstock, spawned a terrific film, D.A. Pennebaker's ""Monterey Pop."" The 1969 Isle of Wight Festival in England, two weeks after Woodstock, included the elusive Bob Dylan. And there were several other gatherings during the late-'60s and early-'70s festival frenzy, including the ill-fated Altamont festival in 1969 and the record-setting Watkins Glen festival in 1973. But nobody talked about a ""Monterey Nation"" or a ""Wight Nation"" or, God forbid, an ""Altamont Nation."" No other festival prompted Charles M. Schulz to name a ""Peanuts"" character after it. No other festival has maintained a viable name for four decades. And no other festival is still so present in the public and media consciousness. With Woodstock's 40th anniversary Saturday comes a plethora of releases, including CDs, DVDs, a VH1 documentary airing Friday, the new movie ""Taking Woodstock"" and several books.  Watch Woodstock co-founder Michael Lang talk about the festival Â» . ""There's a quality to Woodstock that has to do with the ... hugeness of it,"" said festival co-founder Joel Rosenman. ""We seem to remember that it involved the whole generation."" Many members of that generation, he added, weren't aware there were so many others like themselves. ""They had ... been reading in the establishment media they were a splinter here and a fragment there,"" he said. ""And all of a sudden, they get to Woodstock ... and saw the entire world as [they] knew it was on [their] side instead of the side you thought it was on. ... It was pretty heady stuff."" iReport: Memories of Woodstock . By now, the basics of Woodstock have passed into legend. How four men -- Rosenman, his business partner John Roberts, entrepreneur Michael Lang and record executive Artie Kornfeld -- wanted to put on a concert for the counterculture. How their site choices fell through. How Max Yasgur rented his dairy farm with a month to go. How the event drew half a million people, more than twice what had been expected. How it caused a huge traffic jam. How it became a free concert. How it rained. And how everyone -- concertgoers and security, musicians and authorities, visitors and residents -- got along and made the most of the three days with minimal violence and lots of joy.  Watch why Woodstock made a difference Â» . As a resident of the Woodstock Nation might say, the vibes were good. But that doesn't explain how the event gave way to the myth. Elliott Landy, a photographer best known for his ""Music from Big Pink"" and ""Nashville Skyline"" portraits of The Band and Bob Dylan, respectively, believes part of Woodstock's aura came from its isolation. ""In the full Woodstock experience, you were cut off from the rest of ... everyday life,"" he said. ""It was kind of a magic land."" Rock critic Dave Marsh, who said he was offered a ticket but didn't go, puts it succinctly: ""Woodstock was an accident. God liked that one."" But Woodstock was also at the nexus of so many swirling currents of the '60s: the generation gap, the antiwar movement, the evolution of rock music, the growth of the youth culture. One person in Barbara Kopple's VH1 documentary said, with still-discernable anger, ""They [the establishment] were trying to kill us,"" and he wasn't kidding; the draft was ever-present, with the threat of Vietnam hanging over many heads. Music was just as divisive. Unlike today, when underground acts quickly become mainstream through word-of-Internet, the underground in 1969 was truly underground. Only the most popular rock acts appeared on prime time television, and a 1966 Harris poll reported a plurality of people over 21 disliked rock 'n' roll. ""Longhair"" and ""hippie"" weren't descriptions; they were epithets. Woodstock gave the baby boomers a rallying point. If the special editions of magazines trumpeting its success weren't enough, the movie and the soundtrack album were huge hits upon their 1970 release, bringing elements of the Woodstock experience to millions. Santana drummer Michael Shrieve, whose drum solo during the band's ""Soul Sacrifice"" became an indelible Woodstock moment, remembers how fame caught him by surprise. He was waiting in line to see ""Woodstock"" with other band members. As the previous show let out, ""We noticed that people were looking at us and pointing at us, and we didn't know what was going on."" The band found out soon enough: On a tour of Europe, Shrieve stopped at a newsstand to pick up a magazine, and he was on the cover. ""I realized this was taking off,"" he said. Though much is made of the Woodstock spirit -- the camaraderie, the cooperation through the rain and the mud and the traffic -- not everybody bought into it. The Who's Pete Townshend has often criticized Woodstock, disparaging The Who's performance and calling the audience ""a bunch of hypocrites""; he later plowed his Woodstock-era alienation into such songs as ""Won't Get Fooled Again."" (Townshend has also acknowledged that the Woodstock gig was ""important."") Marsh, who wrote a recent cover story on Woodstock for Relix magazine, admires the festival's optimism but not many of its realities: the poor sanitation, the hype, the idea that getting away from society was going to solve its problems. ""We were ambitious as people, and our ambition was to create a beautiful new society. ... And this seemed like a step on the road to a lot of people,"" he said. ""I never bought the thing that the artificial wilderness was a solution to our social problems. ... I think a lot of people thought if you got stoned and bonded together with a bunch of people to whom on Monday you didn't feel bonded at all, that that was a step on the journey."" For all of the good will Woodstock created, it's also blamed for what it didn't do. The war didn't end. Altamont, the hope for a West Coast Woodstock, culminated in an audience member's slaying. And members of the ""Woodstock Nation"" went their separate ways. Woodstock also was the beginning of a new era in the music business -- it became a ""music industry,"" Woodstock co-founder Lang noted. Producer-engineer Eddie Kramer, a Jimi Hendrix colleague who recorded the festival, agreed the music world changed after Woodstock. ""You have to realize that, in 1969, agents and managers were in the background,"" he said. ""And the musicians weren't really competing with each other. They were friendly to each other and were eager to help."" As much as ""getting back to the garden,"" in Joni Mitchell's words, Woodstock now also symbolizes baby boomer nostalgia. Among the related products and events are a 6-CD box set (Rhino); an ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" DVD reissue of director Michael Wadleigh's Oscar-winning documentary (Warner Home Video); the new Ang Lee film ""Taking Woodstock""; ""Woodstock Experience"" remastered CDs of complete live sets by such performers as Santana and Janis Joplin (Sony/Legacy); Friday's VH1 documentary by Oscar-winning filmmaker Barbara Kopple; a tour by the ""Heroes of Woodstock""; an anniversary concert at the Woodstock site in Bethel, New York; and several books, including works by Lang and Landy. That's a lot to pile on to what was, at its heart, a music festival, and perhaps people have expected too much from Woodstock. Just a year after the event, critic J.R. Young reviewed the soundtrack in Rolling Stone and gave voice to the disappointment and cynicism. ""That's why there will never really be a Woodstock Nation,"" said a character in the review, which was written as a short story. ""You won't let anybody live on your land."" And yet ""Woodstock"" remains a magic word -- one that, finally, refuses to reveal its secrets. Woodstock co-founder Rosenman ends up reaching for the elation of Keats' poem ""On First Looking into Chapman's Homer"" -- ""Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/ When a new planet swims into his ken"" -- when trying to describe the festival's thrill. But he stops short of adding up the details. It was the people, he said, who made Woodstock. ""That half a million-strong audience created something -- they created a legend,"" he said. ""I actually don't think it's possible to do the making of that legend and explain it to the satisfaction of almost anybody. I think you'd still come away wondering, 'What the heck made that happen?' "" And Shrieve, who's long since come to terms with being known as ""the guy who did the drum solo at Woodstock,"" is equally philosophical about how the festival is portrayed. ""It's interesting to observe history from the viewpoint of having been there. It also gives you some insight into everything else,"" he said. ""I mean, any historical moment, there are people that are there and people who are not there. And when it grows into something that becomes more mythological, you see people telling the story of how it happened, and you go, 'Wait a minute! That's not what happened!'

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli authorities late Thursday forcibly evacuated hundreds of Palestinian demonstrators from a recently created camp. The actions Thursday night into Friday followed what the Palestinian Popular Struggle Coordination Committee, an activist group, described as an ""Army siege"" of their encampment in Ein Hijleh. Located in the central Jordan Valley not far from Jericho, Ein Hijleh was hatched a week ago by Palestinian activists on West Bank land that belongs to the Greek Orthodox Church. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said authorities moved in -- after having given ample warning to the demonstrators ""to independently evacuate""-- ""due to rock hurling earlier this week at the main Jordan Valley route and other legal considerations."" ""The agitators were evacuated,"" according to the military spokesman, by Israeli troops, border guard personnel and police. Video of the raid aired on Palestinian TV showed hundreds of Israeli troops and police entering Ein Hijleh on foot. Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian lawmaker who heads a medical relief group, said he saw bulldozers and other vehicles accompany the Israeli authorities into the camp using stun grenades and physically manhandling those inside, including women and children. At least 24 people -- including at least one with broken ribs -- needed medical treatment for their injuries, Barghouti told CNN early Friday. The Palestinian Popular Struggle Coordination Committee later tweeted that 35 people were being cared for -- some of them in intensive care -- at a hospital in Jericho, which is about 24 kilometers (15 miles) east of Jerusalem. The Palestinian activist group claimed that before the forced evacuation, Israeli forces had cut off water pipes into Ein Hijleh five times over two days and targeted vehicles carrying food and water. The group said that ""local and international solidarity groups (visited) the village,"" as did members of various Palestinian organizations, six European diplomats and Greek Orthodox Archbishop Atallah Hanna, who ""declared his full support."" ""Our will is strong and we will return,"" said Barghouti, vowing that activists would return to the site soon. This incident isn't the first time that Israeli authorities have forced out Palestinian activists who have hastily and defiantly set up such tent cities. In January 2013, for instance, hundreds of Israeli police swarmed such a makeshift camp in part of the West Bank -- called Bab Alshams by protesters and dubbed E1 by Israel -- over Israel's settlement activity there. CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Jerusalem and Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Atlanta. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Palestinian activists set up an encampment that they called Ein Hijleh .

"(CNN) -- Investigators have busted an international pedophile ring that charged people money to watch live online broadcasts of Filipino children being sexually abused, authorities said. Under way since 2012, the operation has resulted in the arrest of 29 people, 11 of them from the group in the Philippines that facilitated the abuse, Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) said in a statement Wednesday. Some of the people who arranged for the abuse, which was filmed on webcams, were from the children's own families, it said. Fifteen children between the ages of 6 and 15 have been rescued in the Philippines, the British agency said. The investigation was a joint effort between the NCA, the Australian Federal Police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The operation began after British police found ""indecent videos"" on computers at the home of a registered sex offender. The ensuing investigation eventually uncovered the abuse being carried out in the Philippines and people in other countries who were involved in the pedophile ring, the NCA said. Seventeen arrests were made in Britain, the agency said, resulting in five convictions. ""This investigation has identified some extremely dangerous child sexual offenders who believed paying for children to be abused to order was something they could get away with,"" said Andy Baker, deputy director of the NCA's Child Exploitation and Online Protection command. ""Being thousands of miles away makes no difference to their guilt. In my mind, they are just as responsible for the abuse of these children as the contact abusers overseas,"" he said. An Internet scourge . Children's rights advocates say that cyber-sex crimes can be difficult to track down because the private nature of the technology allows crimes to take place in a venue that law enforcement can't easily access, making it harder to gather evidence against perpetrators. Conditions in the Philippines -- such as widespread poverty, an established sex trade, a predominantly English-speaking, technologically-literate population and widespread Internet access -- have made the country vulnerable to such abuse. ""A vast and comparatively wealthy overseas customer base has led to organized crime groups exploiting children for financial gain,"" the NCA said. The British agency cited online conversations in which two of the men convicted under the investigation, Timothy Ford and Thomas Owen, discussed ways to travel to the Philippines to engage in direct abuse of children. In one webchat, Ford, who uses a wheelchair, proposed that Owen could behave as his carer as way to avoid being caught, the agency said. Ford was sentenced to eight and half years in prison in March; Owen was sentenced to seven years in prison in July. The NCA said more than 37,500 pounds ($61,000) had been paid through the crime network in exchange for viewing the abuse of children. Three other separate investigations are under way into the live-streaming of child sexual abuse and have identified 733 suspects worldwide, the agency said.

"(CNN) -- North and South Korea... India and Pakistan... the United States and Iran. No, these are not the next predicted wars but the unlikely doubles teams for an international ping pong event. The International Table Tennis Federation and the Peace and Sport Foundation are organizing an international tournament in Doha, Qatar in November, and they're hoping the unusual teams could help to develop understanding between feuding countries. Joel Bouzou, president of Peace and Sport says he hopes the tournament ""will allow us to reach a stage where we can bury the quarrels of the past."" ""We have witnessed many examples in recent history which show the power of sport to overcome political differences between nations. For example, the recent cricket match between India and Pakistan, or the qualification matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup between Turkey and Armenia,"" Bouzou told CNN. North and South Korea have been asked to form a doubles partnership. The two countries are still technically at war since the 1950-1953 Korean war ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty, but the organisers are hopeful the two teams will agree to work together. And it's not just at the player level. The ITTF says key government officials and diplomats from the competing nations will be in the stands cheering their country on. The ITTF calls this, ""an unprecedented sports event that will break political tensions and unite nations in a way that only table tennis can."" It is hard to imagine ping pong succeeding where decades of political negotiations have failed but the vice-chairman of the Seoul-based Korea Table Tennis Association tells CNN, ""We will have to look into the procedures, but since it's an exhibition match, I don't think there will be any major obstacles as long as North Korea agrees. There's no reason for us to turn this down."" Ju Jong-chol, secretary general of the North Korean Table Tennis Association tells Yonhap news agency he thought the idea of promoting world peace through table tennis was ""a good one."" ""We haven't heard anything specific about how this event will be run,"" Ju added. ""After learning all the details, we will look into whether or not to accept the invitation."" Japan, China and Russia are also being invited to compete in Qatar. The ITTF says that all nations have agreed in principle to compete. Peace and Sport is hoping to make this tournament an annual event using a different sport each year. Table tennis was an obvious sport to start with, because it is forty years after an American table tennis team competed in China. The matches are credited with helping open up China to the world and paved the way for a groundbreaking visit from U.S. President Richard Nixon the following year which forged diplomatic channels between the two countries.","Organizers hope the unusual teams can help develop understanding .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's military is pushing to black out a national news station, calling its citing of a man tying government agents to the attempted assassination of his brother -- a prominent TV news anchor -- ""false, malicious and irresponsible reporting."" Already Wednesday night, multiple people said Geo News was suddenly unavailable in large swaths of Peshawar, parts of Quetta and in military barracks in both cities. On its website, Geo News -- a CNN affiliate -- reported similar blackouts in Okara, Murree and Dera Ghazi Khan as well. And that could be just the beginning. The director general of ISI, Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency, formally complained to the nation's military about Geo's coverage after an attack on one of its anchors, Hamid Mir. The defense ministry then asked the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority to act against Geo News, including possibly suspending and ultimately canceling its license to broadcast. Hamid Mir was shot three times Saturday in Karachi by gunmen in a car and on two motorcycles near Karachi's airport, his network reported. He is now recovering after undergoing what his doctor described as a successful operation. The government condemned this attack while also sharply criticizing Geo News' subsequent reporting of the account of Mir's brother Amir, who is a journalist himself. Amir Mir said his brother believed ISI and specifically its leader, Lt. Gen. Zaheerul Islam, had plans to assassinate him. The defense ministry's complaint -- as cited by the Pakistan Press Foundation -- accuses Geo News of waging ""a vicious campaign ... wherein false accusations were made against a state institution tasked to work for the defense, sovereignty and integrity of Pakistan."" This telecast tried to tarnish state agency's image by ""falsely linking it with ... terrorist outfits/activities,"" the complaint said. ""(This) false, malicious and irresponsible reporting is a continuation of the policy of Geo Network for maligning the state institutions,"" added the complaint. Geo has strongly defended itself against these allegations, in addition to citing other journalists and ordinary Pakistanis who likewise have rallied to its side. Benjamin Ismail, the head of Reporters Without Borders Asia-Pacific desk, said the interview with Hamid Mir's brother ""does not constitute an offense"" and noted that Pakistani authorities ""are perfectly free to address the suspicions against them. His group ranks Pakistan 158th out of 180 countries on its latest World Press Freedom Index. And Bob Dietz, the Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, urged the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority not to act against Geo News based on what he called ""a spurious complaint."" ""We call on Pakistan's security services to recognize the critical role of the media and exercise tolerance and maturity,"" Dietz said in a statement. ""The ISI is free to rebut allegations in the media but should not try to censor coverage."" In an earlier statement, Dietz had called the targeting of Mir ""an indicator that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has not been able to reverse the country's appalling record of violence against journalists, despite pledges to do so."" A former newspaper reporter and editor, Hamid Mir writes columns and hosts a political talk show on Geo News. His guests have included members of Pakistan's ruling government and the opposition. Mir is also writing a book on Osama bin Laden, the late al Qaeda leader whose escape from the Tora Bora mountains of Afghanistan he extensively reported on. Two Pakistani governments -- once in 2007 and again in 2008 -- banned him from appearing on Pakistani television. Journalists Syed Ali Shah in Quetta, Pakistan, and Zahir Shah Sherazi in Peshawar contributed to this report.","Geo News anchor Hamid Mir was wounded last Saturday by gunmen in Karachi .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Behind high, whitewashed walls in the middle of dusty, noisy Kabul is a sacred place respected by all who come through its gates. Many who enter are unable to walk into the compound, which was built as a kindergarten by the occupying Soviets back in the 1970s. Instead, the majority of the men, women and children are carried in on stretchers from the back of ambulances -- their bloodied bodies riddled with bullets and shrapnel; their flesh and organs ripped apart by rockets and machine gun fire. And while most are innocent victims, caught in the middle of Afghanistan's ongoing war against the Taliban insurgency, some of the patients are responsible for the pain and trauma that is being treated. This is Emergency Hospital -- an international NGO run predominantly by Italians -- and it treats all victims of war. Teenage victims . On the afternoon we arrive to watch Emergency and its staff in action, two teenage boys are rushed in from Andar in Ghazni Province -- a Taliban stronghold where some of the worst fighting takes place each day. Najibullah, who is only 15, lies motionless in the ambulance -- part of his jaw has been blown off and he's lost a lot of blood. He's quickly wheeled into the emergency room where doctors and nursing staff immediately go into overdrive to keep him alive. On the bed next to him, his 13-year-old cousin moans in pain. As a doctor removes the blood-soaked bandages wrapped around his right hand, blood gushes onto the floor from where his fingers once were. The boys had been herding sheep when they walked on a landmine -- a crude yet lethal device that's responsible for at least half the injuries treated at Emergency Hospital. In less than 10 minutes, the boys are prepared for surgery and wheeled into the operating theater. Despite the howls of agony, the torn flesh, mutilated limbs and Najibullah's life threatening injuries, the staff work quickly, calmly and professionally -- each highly skilled at their job, knowing exactly what they need to do to save lives. ""This is nothing out of the ordinary,"" explains Emergency Hospital Program Coordinator Emanuele Nannini. ""This is what we do every single day."" Twenty minutes later another ambulance arrives with more casualties of this war. Business as usual in this bloody conflict. Life-saving work . Nannini is one of a dozen Italians and foreigners committed to giving free and proper medical treatment to victims of conflict zones around the world. Founded by Italian surgeon Gino Strada, Emergency was first set up in Iraq in 1994. Then in 1999, Strada came to Afghanistan, initially working with the Mujahideen in the Panjshir Valley, north of the capital, before receiving permission from the Taliban, who were governing at the time, to set up Emergency Hospital in Kabul in 2000. Through his life saving work, Strada and Emergency pressured the Italian parliament to ban the production of landmines. A law that still stands today. Inspired by his fellow countryman, Nannini arrived in Kabul five years ago with a plan to stay only six months. ""It's an amazing place,"" he says. ""Very challenging but also very interesting. Every year I say is the last year but it's very difficult to leave. You get very connected to the place, the people and the hospital."" I ask Nannini what he hates about his job. ""Seeing children injured, suffering, crying,"" he replies without hesitation. ""Unfortunately we see a lot of suffering every day. But we also see a lot of resilience. Afghans are very strong and they're really hoping to have a better future. And while our statistics show a dramatic change and an increase in fighting ... I also think Afghan people are tired of the conflict and they want peace."" Dr. Reinhold Perkmann -- a professor of Cardiovascular Surgery back in Italy -- has been volunteering his lifesaving skills since his first mission to Afghanistan in 2009. He did the night shift and saw his last patient at 5 a.m. Eight hours later he's back in ER treating patients who've undergone serious trauma because of this seemingly endless war. He says he's not suffering from the ""help syndrome"" but rather doing what he was trained to do in a country crying out for skilled medical professionals. Fighting season . ""I'm here because I'm a doctor and I think that everybody needs help and here in Afghanistan the help is very needed."" Perkmann says almost half the cases he sees are children -- blown up by landmines -- and the statistics are only going to get worse once fighting season gets underway with the arrival of the warmer weather. ""I see so many children losing their limbs because of these landmines,"" he says. ""It's hard enough for these people to live in this country, let alone as amputees. It's such a tragic situation."" Emergency Hospital's medical coordinator, Luca Radaelli, jokes with the patients, especially the young ones, hoping to put a smile on their weary faces. But he admits the years of pain and suffering that he's witnessed are starting to wear on him. ""I hate when we can't do anything else, we can't make a difference because the patient is in too bad condition,"" he says. ""We all try but sometimes it's not enough."" One patient in particular was seven-month-old Mohammadullah. The baby boy was in his mother's arms when they were caught in the middle of a firefight -- a bullet hit his spinal cord and the fracture led to meningitis. Despite positive signs of improvement, the infant died two weeks later in the Intensive Care ward surrounded by the staff who had lovingly cared for him. ""That affected all of us,"" says Radaelli with a heavy heart and a sigh. ""We were so hopeful he was going to survive. But this is life in Afghanistan.""

"Cairo (CNN) -- The case against the Muslim Brotherhood's spiritual leader Mohammed Badie and 682 other supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy was adjourned Tuesday at a Egyptian court until next month, defense lawyer Gamal Abdel Meguid said. It comes a day after the same court sentenced 529 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood to death. They were convicted on charges related to violent riots in the southern Egyptian city of Minya in August, including the murder of a police officer, the country's official news agency said. Only 147 of the defendants were reportedly in court Monday. Sixteen people were also acquitted at the hearing. Tuesday's case against another 683 defendants relates to the same unrest. Sixty-two of Tuesday's accused were in attendance for the proceedings at Minya Criminal Court, Meguid said. They had no legal representation in court because defense lawyers boycotted the trial in protest over the death sentences handed down Monday to the 529 Morsy supporters, he said. He was among those boycotting proceedings. Badie, who is being held in custody in the capital, Cairo, did not attend court Tuesday due to security concerns. A verdict is due to be delivered on April 28. Will Egypt carry out sentence? Amnesty International: 'Grotesque move' Monday's mass sentencing prompted wide criticism, with rights group Amnesty International condemning it as ""a grotesque move."" ""This is injustice writ large and these death sentences must be quashed,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, deputy director for Amnesty International in the Middle East and North Africa. While Egypt's courts are quick to punish Morsy supporters, Sahraoui said, they ""ignore gross human rights violations by the security forces."" The Muslim Brotherhood also issued a statement Monday saying the sentence ""violates judicial norms."" However, the head of the Justice Ministry's press office, Abdel Azim el-Ashry, rejected criticism in a statement published by Egypt's State Information Service on Tuesday, saying the court's ruling was not final and that all the defendants have the right to appeal. He also said the more than 350 defendants sentenced to death in absentia could seek new legal proceedings if they appeared in court. Students protest death sentences . For the second consecutive day, students held a protest at Minya University against the death sentences handed down Monday. Omar Abdel Baset, head of the students' union, told CNN that security forces had dispersed Tuesday's demonstration. Several students were injured by pellets that security forces fired at protesters, he said. The demonstration was in support of three students who are among the defendants in Monday's case. Last summer's riots in Minya took place after a deadly crackdown by security forces on two large sit-ins in Cairo, where demonstrators were supporting Morsy, the former head of the Muslim Brotherhood's political arm. Morsy, who was elected president in 2012, was ousted in a coup in July amid widespread protests against his rule, with opponents accusing him of pursuing a divisive and Islamist agenda. He and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up after the coup and now face a variety of charges. In December, Egypt's interim government officially declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? Report: Egypt's army-backed government resigns .

"(CNN) -- Politicians struggle with reinvention after failure, and during the Internet era, everything lives forever in the digital universe. Some things simply cannot be undone, no matter how hard we might try. Buying a nice pair of black glasses, for instance, to suggest character and intellect will not prevent search engines from finding stories and videos of Texas Gov. Rick Perry's famous ""Oops"" moment during a nationally televised debate. Although an entire nation either grimaced or laughed through his blunder, he will continue trying to portray himself as presidential timber, a leader who is as good at creating jobs as he is at inadvertent political humor. Those new specs won't make a grand jury investigation go away, either. A special prosecutor in Austin has impaneled a grand jury to examine allegations that the governor of Texas may have bribed and coerced a key state official to force her out of office. At the time, her office was investigating one of Perry's signature projects, the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute. (Watchdog group Texas for Public Justice filed the complaint with the prosecutors.) Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney, oversees the Public Integrity Unit, which investigates possible corruption in state government. Her office had launched the investigation of the multibillion-dollar cancer research agency after 18 scientists, including the Nobel laureate director, resigned in protest. They had claimed that investment decisions for that organization were being made without proper scientific review and that tens of millions of dollars were ending up in the hands of Perry supporters and donors for their business ventures. One former executive of the agency had been indicted in connection with an improperly awarded $11 million grant, and the case is pending. And then Lehmberg was arrested for driving while intoxicated. Republican Perry demanded that Lehmberg, a Democrat, resign after a video showed her behaving belligerently and asking for favoritism during booking. When she refused to step down, he threatened to withhold her $7.5 million state funding, which she was using to pay for the cancer investigation. Lehmberg would not accede to the governor's demands -- she is a locally elected official -- and he followed through on this threat to veto the budget. The move to cut the funding for the state watchdog group had a few political benefits for the Texas governor. He had just eliminated money for a legal inquiry in which he possibly might have, eventually, been implicated. If she had quit, Perry would have also had the authority to name Lehmberg's replacement, most likely a Republican, which then becomes a convenient way to avoid any potential charges or political damage in advance of a second GOP presidential run. A special prosecutor, Michael McCrum, was assigned to the case and has said he was ""very concerned"" about Perry's behavior. The governor has, consequently, hired a high-profile Austin criminal defense lawyer. Perry has not spoken publicly about the case, but his office is arguing that he was constitutionally empowered with a line-item veto and that he did nothing wrong. Because he claims to have been acting in his capacity as governor, Perry plans to have his lawyer paid out of taxpayer funds. Any attempts to characterize the investigation of Perry as a political prosecution are uninformed. Texas law is clear on official abuse of power: Prosecutors would only need to show that Perry was offering considerations in return for actions by District Attorney Lehmberg. If there is evidence of any additional conversations after Lehmberg's original refusal and the formal veto, and evidence that Perry or his representatives attempted further negotiations for her resignation in exchange for anything, McCrum's presentation to the grand jury could become more compelling in convincing members that Perry was coercing another officeholder. A Travis County judge said it was communicated to him that Perry's representatives told Lehmberg, even after the veto, that money for her office would be restored if she resigned, actions that could easily be interpreted as bribery or coercion by the grand jurors. The special prosecutor appears to have confirmed that he is looking at whether Perry's office made such potentially illegal representations by acknowledging that he is looking at everything ""before and after the veto."" Perry's problems come at precisely the wrong moment in his reintroduction tour of America, and the legal tangle might harm his presidential profile worse than shutting down lanes of a bridge. In fact, the Texas governor's actions, if proved by evidence, are worse than the New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie team's traffic tricks because Perry might have obstructed justice, not just a thoroughfare. At least Christie has exhibited the basic sense to use his campaign funds to pay his $300,000-plus in legal fees and not lean on the state's overburdened taxpayers to fund his defense. The secrecy of grand jury proceedings are likely to prevent Perry from getting hammered in the media on every day, but his troubles quickly turn into good news for the emerging campaign of Jeb Bush. Neither Perry nor Christie has to be convicted of a crime for the former Florida governor to be viewed as the putative GOP front-runner for the 2016 presidential nomination; they need only to have their reputations harmed. Christie is already battered, and Perry is just starting to take punches, which continues to prove there is still entertainment value in American presidential politics. Just not much character or leadership. Join us Facebook/CNNOpinion.","James Moore: Texas governor reinventing himself, but grand jury inquiry won't go away .

"(CNN) -- Mandatory evacuations were lifted Wednesday for nearly 1,700 homes in the path of a wildfire near Rancho Cucamonga, California, but fire officials urged some residents to keep on an eye on the wind-whipped blaze, authorities said. The fire, fanned by strong wind gusts and high temperatures, began in the Etiwanda Preserve in San Bernardino National Forest at about 8 a.m. local time, according to Cal Fire. By late afternoon, it had grown to more than 1,000 acres, the agency said. Four schools -- a high school, intermediate school and two elementary schools -- were evacuated, and a temporary evacuation center has been established in Rancho Cucamonga, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said. While mandatory evacuations were lifted, a voluntary evacuation remained in effect for neighborhoods within possible range of the fire, authorities said. At least one building has been damaged and a number of others are being threatened by the fire, Cal Fire said. More than 700 firefighters and 55 fire engines, were battling the blaze dubbed the Etiwanda Fire, according to InciWeb, a U.S. multiagency fire response website. With wind gusts clocked at 60 mph, fire officials say they have been unable to launch firefighting aircraft. ""The big challenge on these fires is the wind and the unpredictability, and with winds like this we can't put up aircraft. It's just too dangerous. So we try and figure out where it's going to end up and put our resources there,"" Bob Poole of the U.S. Forestry Service told CNN affiliate KCBS. The fire came the same day the National Weather Service issued a ""red flag warning"" for the area, citing the fire danger posed by high temperatures, strong winds and dry conditions.

"(CNN) -- Flight MH-370 may go down in history as one of most incredible aviation mysteries. The cruel reality is that even though we have a fair amount of information now, we still know so little. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak informed the families of the victims that the plane had crashed into the remote south Indian Ocean, and all 239 people onboard are presumed dead. That tragic but not unexpected conclusion was based on data analysis by satellite company Inmarsat, which Malaysia now says was able to track Flight 370 until the signal ended very near where searchers are now hunting for plane wreckage. The location tells a lot about what might have happened to the doomed flight while telling us not a single detail about why it crashed. The presumed location of the wreckage makes it all but impossible for certain scenarios to have played out as many observers insisted they must have. The first thing to understand is altitude is everything. A turbofan powered jet like the Boeing 777-200ER relies on altitude to make good on its ultra long-range capabilities. At its normal cruising altitudes from around 35,000 to 40,000 feet, the 777 can fly very long distances, in excess of 11,000 miles. But it seldom flies long routes. Flight 370 search unites global community . On its trip from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, the plane would have had, according to investigators' projections, around seven hours of total endurance at a normal cruising speed of around 600 mph -- just enough to have flown its suspected flight path north for 40 minutes, west for around that much time again, and then south for many hours. At lower altitudes, turbofan engines like the Rolls-Royce engines on the Malaysia Airlines airplane, burn substantially more fuel than they do at typical cruise altitudes -- as much as twice depending on the altitudes one uses for comparison. The increase in fuel burn will greatly reduce range, making it impossible for Flight MH-370 to have reached the southern Indian Ocean at a low altitude. It would need to have flown at a much higher optimum altitude in order to make it that far. Pilots can reduce the power to cut back on fuel flow, of course, but that also reduces airspeed, which again reduces range. There's no winning when it comes to flying a turbofan-powered airplane: If you want to fly far, you need to fly high. So the fuel required for MH-370 to have reached the presumed crash location around 1500 miles west of Perth, Australia, means that the airplane did not do a lot of climbing or descending after it deviated from its original planned route to Beijing while it was still an hour or so north of Kuala Lumpur. So if there was a struggle for control of the flight -- whether it was mechanical issues or a hijacker -- it could not have lasted long or involved great altitude deviations. This means it's hard, though not impossible, to explain the disappearance as being the result of a mechanical or electrical failure. Such a scenario, as I've been saying since the beginning of the mystery, would require a kind of mechanical magic bullet, an event that would have taken out the transponder and ACARS radio, as well as the voice communications radios. Why else would they not have communicated the emergency? Pilot: How mechanical problem could have downed Flight 370 . Then one must accept that such a failure chain could then allow the crew -- or skilled intruder-- to be able to drive the airplane around the sky for a protracted period of time, eventually pointing it south, in the opposite direction from where the airplane was originally headed. Let's remember, too, that the airplane would have to maintain an altitude sufficient to allow it to reach the southern Indian Ocean. All this must also have left the 777 in good enough shape to fly for another six hours or so before crashing. A failure of the pressurization system might account for the scenario, but only if the pilots completely mismanaged their response to the emergency. The 777's backup and emergency oxygen systems are just as intelligently designed as the rest of the jet's redundant systems. It's also difficult, if not impossible, to explain how the jet could have made the turns it did if the crew were unconscious during that time. Were they desperately trying to find an airport before time ran out? If so, they would have done two things they didn't do: They would have communicated the emergency and they would have descended. Neither of those things happened. While it's horrific to imagine, a botched hijacking or failed pilot commandeering of the airplane are still the most likely scenarios. Only when searchers have located and recovered the wreckage, as we all desperately hope they do, will we have our first good clues to what have might have unfolded on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-370. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Goyer.","Robert Goyer: Flight 370 may be remembered as one of the biggest aviation mysteries .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Jared Lee Loughner, the alleged gunman in last year's mass shooting outside an Arizona supermarket in Tucson that killed six people and wounded then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, pleaded guilty Tuesday to 19 charges in exchange for the government not seeking the death penalty. Under the plea deal, Loughner will be sentenced to life in prison with no eligibility for parole, federal prosecutors said. His sentencing is scheduled for November 15, prosecutors said. In court, Loughner also waived his right to pursue an insanity defense. ""My name is Jared Lee Loughner,"" the defendant told the court when he held up his right hand under oath. Loughner calmly told the court he understood his guilty plea. ""Yes, that is correct,"" he said. ""I'm 23 years old,"" he told the court. ""I attended college for five years at a community college."" Earlier Tuesday, Judge Larry Alan Burns found Loughner competent to stand trial in a federal court in Tucson. Warning signs of violence: What to do . ""He's a different person in appearance and affect,"" the judge said about Loughner, who was present in the courtroom. ""He's tracking today. He appears to assist his lawyers. Court's own observations are that there's no question he understands what's happening today."" Loughner had been facing more than 50 federal charges, and the remaining offenses will be dropped in exchange for the guilty pleas if Loughner is sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement, according to the written agreement filed in court. Under the pleas, Loughner admitted guilt in the attempted assassination of Giffords and the murders of federal employees U.S. District Court Chief Judge John M. Roll, 63, and congressional aide Gabriel M. Zimmerman, 30, prosecutors said. Loughner also pleaded guilty to the attempted murders of federal employees and congressional aides Ronald S. Barber, 65, and Pamela K. Simon, 63, prosecutors said. Loughner also admitted causing the deaths of Christina-Taylor Green, age 9; Dorothy ""Dot"" J. Morris, 76; Phyllis C. Schneck, 79; and Dorwan C. Stoddard, 76, prosecutors said. Loughner admitted injuring with a Glock pistol 10 persons participating at an activity provided by the U.S. government and creating a grave risk of death to 13 more persons, prosecutors said. Prosecutors agreed to a plea deal -- and not to seek the death penalty -- after taking into account Loughner's history of mental illness and the views of victims and their families. ""It is my hope that this decision will allow the Tucson community, and the nation, to continue the healing process free of what would likely be extended trial and pre-trial proceedings that would not have a certain outcome,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. Fast facts: The Tuscon shooting . U.S. Attorney John S. Leonardo in Arizona added: ""Given the defendant's history of significant mental illness, this plea agreement, which requires the defendant to spend the remainder of his natural life in prison, with no possibility of parole, is a just and appropriate resolution of this case."" Walking with a bit of a slouch, Loughner cast a sneer at the packed gallery when he entered the courtroom. During the guilty plea proceedings, the gallery was quiet, with some people sniffing and wiping away tears. An order from the court indicating the planned change of pleas was released Monday. Loughner earlier had pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, including murder and attempted murder. The January 8, 2011, attack killed six people and wounded 13 others, including Giffords, who was holding a meet-and-greet event with constituents. Giffords, who was shot in the head, stepped down from her position in Congress in January 2012 to focus on her recovery. Ron Barber, an aide also wounded in the attack, now holds the seat. Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly, said in a statement Tuesday that he and his wife are satisfied with the agreement. ""The pain and loss caused by the events of January 8, 2011 are incalculable,"" Kelly said. ""Avoiding a trial will allow us -- and we hope the whole Southern Arizona community -- to continue with our recovery and move forward with our lives."" Susan Hileman, 58, who was wounded, said after the court proceedings that she was proud to be an American. ""This is the system doing its best. It's not a perfect solution,"" Hileman told reporters. ""This is the best that can be expected."" Loughner was facing the possibility of a death sentence if convicted. Dr. Christina Pietz, a forensic psychologist, told the judge Tuesday that Loughner is ""one of the worst"" mentally ill patients she's ever seen. But she continued, adding that Loughner has shown improvement and he's no longer in restraints. ""He is competent to proceed,"" Pietz told the court. He's no longer hearing voices, and he has no difficulty in understanding, Pietz said. Loughner is rational and able to consult with his attorneys, she said. Loughner also understands that he will never leave prison and has told Pietz: ""I'm 23 years old, this is it. This is my life."" Loughner is worried that he will be harmed by other inmates, but Pietz said she thinks Loughner would be all right in the general prison population. Loughner, however, is still on suicide watch, Pietz said. Pietz met Loughner in March 2011 and determined he had schizophrenia and wasn't competent to participate in court proceedings. She was the first doctor to diagnose him with a psychotic disease, Pietz said. Loughner was disappointed and upset upon hearing the diagnosis, Pietz said. Loughner said he wished he would have taken medication and that things might have been different. He started taking medication for the first time on June 21, 2011, and over time, he expressed remorse about what he did, Pietz testified. By July 9, 2011, Loughner expressed regret and ""assassination remorse,"" Pietz said. Loughner told Pietz that he was especially sad about the child killed in the shooting -- Christina Taylor Green, age 9, who was remembered nationally because she was born on September 11, 2001. Loughner also spoke with Pietz about Giffords. Pietz testified that Loughner told her: ""I know she's alive"" and ""there's no way she survived a shot to the head."" Loughner said he feels like he set out to do the shooting and failed, Pietz said. Loughner said if this is true, ""Jared is a failure,"" according to Pietz. In discussion with prison officials, Loughner has said, ""I'll never get out,"" Pietz testified. Loughner likes his prison jobs and he gets paid for them, which is important for him, Pietz said. The work makes him feel proud to do well in something, Pietz said. Pietz recounted Loughner's teenage years, saying that he appeared normal until age 16. Then he showed symptoms of depression in 2006, and his girlfriend broke up with him and a friend died, Pietz said. Loughner sought treatment and was diagnosed with depression, Pietz said. He saw a psychiatrist again after he was caught drunk at school, Pietz said. According to records, he didn't take his anti-depression medication, Pietz said. In high school, he began hearing voices and yelling out things in the classroom -- behaviors that are symptoms of schizophrenia, Pietz said. He wrote nonsensical things on the chalkboard, showed a disorganized thought process, and became obsessed with the Constitution, Pietz said. Friends feared he would commit suicide, Pietz said. Loughner became ostracized in high school, but at that point, there were no signs he would hurt anyone, Pietz said. Loughner's mental condition has been central to much of the related court proceedings since the shooting. In February, a federal judge ruled Loughner could receive medical treatment for another four months. A psychologist found ""measurable progress"" in the suspect's condition. Previously on CNN.com: Citing 'progress,' judge extends treatment for Arizona shooting suspect . The medical treatment plan for Loughner was aimed at improving his mental state so he would be competent to stand trial. Loughner was declared incompetent to stand trial in May 2011 after an initial evaluation term at a federal mental hospital in Springfield, Missouri. In July 2011, what officials described as bizarre and suicidal actions by Loughner while in custody pushed a federal appeals panel to allow authorities to force the defendant to take anti-psychotic medication. Prosecutors said then that Loughner had been deteriorating: He displayed screaming and crying fits that lasted hours, harmed himself and made claims that the radio was inserting thoughts into his head. His attorneys consistently fought court rulings that Loughner continue his treatment at the hospital. In November, defense attorney Ellis Johnston argued before a different federal judge that the side effects of the psychotropic drugs his client had been receiving during his court-ordered treatment may interfere with Loughner's ability to work with his attorneys. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Christina Cabanillas said that Loughner ""could revert to being a danger to himself"" if the medication were halted. Court documents released a few days after the shooting showed that investigators found a letter from Giffords in a safe at the house where Loughner lived with his parents, thanking him for attending a 2007 event. ""Also recovered in the safe was an envelope with handwriting on the envelope stating 'I planned ahead,' and 'my assassination' and the name 'Giffords,' along with what appears to be Loughner's signature,"" the affidavit stated.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The image was horrific: A whimpering beagle, ribs showing through its fur, tethered to a post inside the no-go zone around the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. The scene was captured by freelance journalists who drove through towns within a few kilometers of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, and who left food for the animal. But animal rescue activists who have braved the exclusion zone around the plant say there many others like it. ""I understand the nuclear danger and everything, but they're just being left to starve to death, basically,"" said Isabella Gallaon-Aoki of Japan Earthquake Animal Rescue and Support. Gallaon-Aoki and others like her have been slipping into the 20-km radius around Fukushima Daiichi to retrieve pets and feed livestock left behind when their owners were forced to evacuate. Pet owners have sent her group their addresses, accompanied by pleas to rescue their animals, left behind when they fled for what was supposed to be a short time. A month later, the volunteers are putting their long-term health on the line, putting on protective gear and entering the 20-km radius around the plant that was declared off-limits in the early days of the crisis. Hiroko Ito's 5-year-old Shiba, Non, is among those rescued by Gallaon-Aoki's group. Ito said she left food for the dog, but didn't expect to be gone a month. ""We tried to save him, but we couldn't get in,"" Ito said. Radiation levels recorded by photographers Shuji Ogawa and Naomi Toyoda were not high enough to cause immediate illness, but would pose potential health risks with prolonged exposure. Gallaon-Aoki said she knows the risks, ""but I feel personally that the risk that there is is worth taking for what I can achieve by doing so."" From the prime minister's office to town halls, Japanese authorities told CNN they have no provisions for dealing with animals when their owners are ordered to clear out -- orders that have been expanded to other towns around the crippled power plant, which has been emitting radioactive particles since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that knocked out its coolant systems. Gallaon-Aoki called that ""unforgivable."" ""I understand they have a huge problem as far as people are concerned. They are dealing with a lot,"" she said. ""But, I mean, there are people and groups who would be willing to help, and surely they could kind of set some sort of well-coordinated effort.""

"(CNN) -- If you took a moment during the heat of the presidential race to drop by the Mitt Romney campaign office, you would have been shocked by the number of white people working to get him elected. About the only color you would have seen were the red and white in the Romney-Ryan posters. If you met with Romney's senior campaign team -- the decision makers -- you would have said major corporations in America have more diversity on their boards of directors than these guys. At a Romney campaign event, followers of mine on Twitter always played the ""do-you-know-that-one-black-person-who-is-always-standing-behind-Mitt-with-a-sign"" game. Seriously. Seeing someone black, Hispanic or Asian at a Romney campaign rally was always a sight to behold. So why in the world is Mitt Romney now largely blaming minorities for the butt-kicking administered to him by President Obama? Politics: Jindal slams Romney for 'gifts' comment about minorities, young voters . In a conference call with donors, Romney attributed his loss to the president playing Santa Claus by showering minorities and young voters with ""gifts"" -- health care, student loans and those things Americans clearly don't need. ""The Obama campaign was following the old playbook of giving a lot of stuff to groups that they hoped they could get to vote for them and be motivated to go out to the polls, specifically the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people,"" Romney said during the conference call. ""In each case they were very generous in what they gave to those groups."" Opinion: Democrats, don't get too cocky . Hey, black people, Mitt reveals what you got for your vote! ""With regards to African-American voters, 'Obamacare' was a huge plus -- and was highly motivational to African-American voters. You can imagine for somebody making $25-, or $30-, or $35,000 a year, being told 'You're now going to get free health care' -- particularly if you don't have it, getting free health care worth, what, $10,000 a family, in perpetuity -- I mean this is huge. Likewise with Hispanic voters, free health care was a big plus."" Hey, Hispanic people, what did Obama have for you behind door No. 2? ""The amnesty for the children of illegals -- the so-called Dream Act kids -- was a huge plus for that voting group. On the negative side, of course, they always characterized us as being anti-immigrant, being tough on illegal immigration, and so forth, so that was very effective with that group."" Jindal: How Republicans can win future elections . Wow, thanks, Daddy Mitt, for breaking that down for us! Now it's time for a dose of reality from the black guy to the white guy, Mitt Romney. Mitt, last I checked, the Affordable Care Act is for all Americans. The white ones too! Your effort to portray the health care law as nothing more than a freebie to the blacks is a joke. The Dream Act for kids could largely be seen as helping Latinos, but there are some white folks and people of African descent mixed into the pot that makes up those in the country illegally, so you're again off base. But Mitt, you need to check your facts and realize that there were a lot of white people who really didn't like you. Opinion: Republicans lost the culture war . According to exit polls, 72% of all U.S. voters were white. That's a super majority. Mitt, you got 59% of those voters. That's a big number, but you must understand that you might have wanted to appeal to more than just white voters to win. When you give one speech to the NAACP and only one interview with a black media outlet, Black Enterprise -- son, that's not gonna cut it. But the most hilarious thing to see is how many of the whitest states in America the white guy lost to the black guy. See, if you accept Romney's theory that minorities were a prime reason he lost, then he should have cleaned up in the Electoral College in those really, really, really white states. Let's take a look: . Maine, 94% white: Obama . Vermont, 94% white: Obama . New Hampshire, 92% white: Obama . West Virginia, 93% white: Romney . Iowa, 88% white: Obama . North Dakota, 88% white: Romney . Wyoming, 85% white: Romney . Idaho, 83% white: Romney . Nebraska, 82% white: Romney . Ohio, 81% white: Obama . Utah, 80% white: Romney . That means of 11 really, really, really white states, Obama won five and Romney won six. So Mitt, if it's just about those minorities, what happened? This is why Mitt Romney shouldn't have been president. He can't accept reality, and his judgment on his loss is more than suspect. Even Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a fellow Republican, had to smack Romney for his ignorant comments: ""I absolutely reject that notion,"" he said. ""I think that's absolutely wrong."" Opinion: How Republicans can win future elections . Bottom line, Mitt: The black guy beat you because he offered a more inclusive message to a cross section of people than you. You wanted to protect the richest of the rich in this country, and President Obama saw that providing a pathway to college to a wider number of Americans, as well as confronting the health crisis we have, was vitally important. Mitt, your message was arrogant and dismissive. The ""47%"" comment you made at that Florida fundraiser, which you later said was ""completely wrong,"" was clearly meant in earnest. You actually believed what you said. You think that minorities and young people are a bunch of victims who just want free stuff, or as you call them, gifts. Well, Mitt, America should be thankful minorities and young people rejected your nonsense. We need a president who offers a vision for a more inclusive America, not one who sees health care, college loans and an initiative to deal with immigration reform as ""gifts.""

"(CNN) -- Virginia is a cautionary tale for conservatives this year. And those Republicans who always argue that their party wins when it moves further to the right are going to have a lot of explaining to do after Election Day. Polls show that ""teavangelist"" Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli is going down to a decisive defeat in the governor's race against an exceptionally flawed Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and Clinton fund-raiser. The reason is simple: Cuccinelli is too extreme for swing voters in Virginia -- and that neatly symbolizes the GOP's problem as it looks to the congressional midterms of 2014 and the presidential campaign of 2016. The problems have been long brewing in Virginia. Once a Republican bastion, the Old Dominion began to turn from red to purple in 2008 when Barack Obama became the first Democrat to win the state since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. But in true swing state fashion, Virginia turned around and elected conservative Bob McDonnell governor in 2009; he managed to win by 17 points, cloaking his conservatism in a family-friendly demeanor. Obama won the state again in 2012, buoyed by demographic changes and the increasing wealth in the region around Washington. Nonetheless, a centrist Republican might still have been well-positioned to win Virginia's governorship in this off-year election. But that does not remotely describe Cuccinelli. A tea party favorite and self-described ""Second Amendment-supporting Christian right-to-life home-school dad,"" Cuccinelli has built a political career on a foundation of strident social conservatism. Proclaiming ""homosexuality is wrong,"" supporting abstinence-only sex education and devoting himself to abortion restrictions as a matter of faith and law, Cuccinelli has been eager to use political office to advance an ideological agenda. As attorney general he sued to stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, challenged the Environmental Protection Agency's fuel-efficiency standards, backed the controversial Arizona illegal immigration law and issued a legal opinion that sexual orientation should not be included in nondiscrimination statutes for the University of Virginia. His extreme play-to-the-base conservative reputation was only accelerated by the selection at the state convention of E.W. Jackson as his running mate for lieutenant governor. He's an African-American evangelical pastor with a knack for saying things such as the following: Democrats are ""anti-Christian, anti-Bible, anti-family, anti-life and anti-God""; ""Liberalism and their ideas have done more to kill black folks whom they claim so much to love than the Ku Klux Klan, lynching and slavery and Jim Crow ever did,"" and ""Obama clearly has Muslim sensibilities. He sees the world and Israel from a Muslim perspective."" Add this all together and you have the most far-right statewide ticket in recent memory. Not surprisingly, centrists and other swing voters are looking elsewhere. Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis is polling a respectable 10% -- an indication of the political costs that come from such strident social conservatism, even among fellow travelers on the center-right. Women voters are supporting McAuliffe by 20% -- a cavernous gap that reflects Cuccinelli's social conservative obsession. Against almost any other Republican, McAuliffe would be vulnerable, but not Cuccinelli. October's GOP-driven government shutdown caused Cuccinelli to play defense, reversing longtime rhetoric by suddenly denouncing the effort to force a delay in Obamacare's implementation and even refusing to be photographed with Sen. Ted Cruz for fear of further alienating swing voters. At the gubernatorial debates, the defiant culture warrior was reduced to bleating about the importance of bipartisanship and compromise -- laugh lines if you knew the first thing about Cuccinelli's record. Cuccinelli's problems must be seen side by side with the success of another Republican running for governor -- Chris Christie. The New Jersey incumbent is cruising to re-election by a broad margin in a state where only 20% of voters are registered Republicans. He is narrowly winning nonwhite voters, and winning women by a 20-point margin. The difference between the two candidates is self-evident -- Christie has governed as an unapologetic centrist Republican with a no-nonsense focus on fighting for fiscal discipline rather than an obsession with social conservatism. He has built cross-aisle coalitions, even on controversial policy proposals, and reached out beyond the base. He puts problem-solving ahead of partisanship or ideology. In other words, Christie is pretty much the opposite of Cuccinelli, and that's why he is winning in an otherwise ugly year for Republicans. Conservatives will come up with lots of reasons why a swing state such as Virginia seems to be slipping away. But let's cut to the chase -- candidates who specialize only in playing to the base and pushing ideological absolutism lose. Extremes are always ultimately their own side's worst enemy. And Cuccinelli's last desperate attempts to present himself as a bipartisan problem-solver or a libertarian are really just evidence of the political bankruptcy of his position. For those conservatives who always argue that moving more rigidly to the right is the answer to all the Republican Party's political problems, the toxic Cuccinelli-Jackson ticket is providing an enduring Exhibit A in making the opposite case. It is an example of what not to do -- nationally and especially in must-win swing states such as Virginia. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Ken Cuccinelli appears too extreme for swing voters in Virginia .
Democrat Terry McAuliffe would be vulnerable against almost any other Republican, he says .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of protesters rallied worldwide Saturday against the imprisonment and possible execution of an Iranian woman convicted of adultery. Sakineh Mohammedie Ashtiani was originally sentenced to death by stoning, but it was put on hold earlier this month after an international outcry. In London, protesters held posters with Ashtiani's likeness while a speaker criticized Iran's treatment of her. Many demonstrating in Trafalgar Square held signs reading, ""No to Stoning. No to Executions."" John Lennon's ""Imagine"" played in the background. In Stockholm, Sweden, protesters chanted for Ashtiani's release while calling stoning a medieval practice that must end. They also signed a large petition calling for her release. The case has drawn international attention. Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006 and faces the possibility of execution. The London protesters said Iran has unfairly sentenced others to death, including 18 gay citizens. In Toronto, Canada, one woman showed a graphic display with red-colored stones to symbolize the instruments and results of stoning. Despite the sentencing delay, human rights activists wanted to remind the world of Ashtiani's plight, said Mina Ahadi, chairman of the International Committee Against Execution and Stoning, one of the group's leading Saturday's protests. ""The fact is, the execution can still happen,"" Ahadi said. ""And, often times in Iran, these types of executions will happen without any notice."" More than 30 cities participated in ""International Sakineh Mohammedie Ashtiani Day"" at 2 p.m. local time. Cities holding rallies included Washington, New York, London, Venice, Paris, Berlin and Ottawa, organizers said. Organizers hoped the rallies would help free Ashtiani and intensify the international support she gained earlier when her case was widely publicized. ""International pressure is what causes change,"" Ahadi said. ""The authorities in Iran aren't immune to this pressure -- we want to release Ashtiani, and we think these rallies are a huge factor in doing so."" Earlier this month, Ashtiani's lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, told CNN that she confessed to the crime after being subjected to 99 lashes. She later recanted the confession and has denied wrongdoing, he said. Iranian state media reported this month that the nation's judiciary chief halted the execution of Ashtiani. ""Although the verdict still stands and is definite, the execution has been halted on humanitarian grounds from the order of the honorable judiciary chief, and will not be implemented at this time,"" Malek Ajdar Sharifi, a judiciary official in East Azerbaijan province, told Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency. Human rights activist Maryam Namazie said Saturday's protests are critical for freeing Ashtiani. ""Very often the regime has quietly and privately executed people even though it said it's not going to,"" said Namazie, spokeswoman of Iran Solidarity and One Law for All. CNN's Karen Smith contributed to this article.","Protesters rally worldwide in support of Iranian woman .

"(CNN) -- Storms tore a deadly path through at least three counties in Arkansas on Sunday evening and ripped houses, cars and forests to shreds, strewing rubble for miles. Though it's not yet official, weather forecasters strongly suspect tornadoes are to blame for at least 14 deaths and devastating damage in the state. Two more people died in storms on Iowa and Oklahoma. A tornado's shearing, twisting winds can exceed 300 mph, and though they usually last only seconds, some cyclones endure much longer, razing swaths up to a mile wide that scar landscapes for months to come and inflict tragic human losses. The United States has the highest number of tornado occurrences in the world, with an average of 1,200 tornadoes reported each year, according to the National Weather Service. Arkansas winds 'severe' Meteorologists rank a tornado based on the strength of its winds and the area over which it spreads destruction. The Enhanced Fujita Scale assigns tornadoes corresponding numbers from EF0, with gusts from 65 to 85 mph, to the mightiest EF5, with gusts over 200 mph. The EF0's winds are described as ""gale"" winds; those of the EF5 are called ""incredible."" The figures for tornadoes' wind speeds are based on assessments of the damage they leave behind on the ground. Only 59 EF5 storms have hit the United States since 1950, according to weather service records. The latest one devastated Moore, Oklahoma, in May of last year. Though meteorologists have not finished analyzing the most recent Arkansas storm, so far the state has been spared an EF5, the NWS says. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers estimates that the winds that ravaged the town of Mayflower, Arkansas, on Sunday had speeds of 130 to 150 mph, which would correspond to an EF3 tornado, which the Fujita Scale describes as ""severe."" Let's take a look at the nature of the strongest tornadoes, the EF5s, the strongest storms on Earth. Where do storms of this strength most commonly hit? While EF5 storms are rare, the area in the Great Plains known as ""Tornado Alley"" gets more than its share. The alley runs through Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Iowa. There also seems to be a focus for strong tornadoes in an area known as ""Dixie Alley,"" which covers parts of the Southeast and includes Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia. What factors give rise to a storm of this strength? A number of factors have to come together at the right time and place to produce a strong tornado. The clash of warm and cold air at the surface combined with lift in the atmosphere and strong winds, both at the ground and high above, help contribute. The greater the temperature differences and the winds, the greater the chance for supercells, the thunderstorms that produce tornadoes. How long does it take to assess the strength of a storm? Why does it take so long? After a tornado, the local National Weather Service office sends a team to take a look at the damage. In the case of the monster twister in Moore last year, the Norman, Oklahoma, office sent numerous teams into the field to evaluate damage. Since this storm path was 17 miles long and the damage path was so wide, it took time to see all of the damage. The strongest tornado on record to date struck Moore in 1999. It had winds recorded at 318 mph at 300 feet above the Earth's surface. Officials estimated winds at the surface were at 250 mph.

The Duchess has never been to Australia before and what stronger message could there be to say she has arrived? It's a rite of passage for tourists to have a picture taken at Uluru at sunset. But this image is also loaded with family history. Prince Charles and Diana posed in the same spot on their first foreign tour as a family. The interesting thing here is that Kate and William's picture didn't work. The shoot was rushed and the couple looked awkward. You can even see the shadows of photographers at their feet. This picture places Kate in a country where she will be Queen but it also speaks to the media pressure the couple are under and trying to juggle. Future head of state . Prince William knows he hasn't been the headline act of this tour, with the spotlight firmly fixed on his wife and son. But look closely and there's been an interesting shift in his public appearances. There were the usual fun moments, typified by sporting challenges with his wife and intimate moments with his son, but there's also a creeping formality to his engagements. This was most obvious for me when he sat down with the Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, in Sydney. It was a kingly side that I can't remember seeing in him before -- Prince William is a future head of state. During this tour we got to know a new generation of royalty (George) but we also saw an existing one (William and Kate) mature. They are doing it in their own way by focusing on events that reflect their personal interests (conservation, the military, sport, young people and hospices) and they've done so to rapturous praise in the Australian media and amongst the political leadership. If they haven't killed off the republican debate, they've at least put it on the back burner. They've also added a chapter to their official biography.","The royal tour images will be used to illustrate an ongoing history of monarchy, writes CNN's Max Foster .

"(CNN) -- Ever dreamed of driving through a traffic-free Yosemite National Park? It's possible when you step outside the typical summer season. In fact, winter's embrace means a slackened tourist pace in many popular warm-weather destinations, so this is an ideal time to explore America's open roads. Witness Yellowstone Falls grow an icy exoskeleton as the river persists out of sight. In Utah's Arches National Park, the low winter sun creates optimum conditions for photographing the mighty sandstone sculptures, even prettier with a dusting of snow. Out east, the Great Smoky and Shenandoah National Parks compensate for southerly latitude with frosty altitude and leafless, ice-glistened forests. Just remember, winter driving brings its own set of cautions: the more majestic the conditions, often the more dangerous the road, especially when tooling along unfamiliar routes. From Alaskan fjords to New Mexico's high desert pueblos and covered-bridge country in Indiana, here are America's top winter drives you'll want to experience before spring. Arches National Park, Utah . Starting point: Moab, UT . The Route: 36 miles on the park's Scenic Drive . What to expect: Beautiful any time of year, Arches National Park's natural sandstone sculptures assume an ethereal quality when covered in a layer of snow and bathed in soft winter lightâbest for desert photography. The scenic drive is paved, and even after a storm, snow usually melts off quickly. Where to stop: Moderate daytime temperatures (usually in the mid-40s; dress in layers) invite a walk along the Park Avenue Trail, a stroll right through The Windows, and a pause to marvel at Balanced Rock. Badlands Loop Road, South Dakota . Starting point: Wall, SD . The route: 40 miles on South Dakota Highway 240 . What to expect: The temperatures may hover around zero, but the striking, stratified land formations that draw summer thousands remain steadfastâand look even more photo-worthy in a dusting of seasonally light snow. You won't find many other travelers poking about, so it may just be you, the park rangers, and a whole bunch of bighorn sheep. Where to stop: Any of the 14 scenic overlooks to watch the sun and shadows play tag on the badlands, even if it is a wee bit nippy out there. Travel + Leisure: Most romantic winter destinations . Cape Cod, Massachusetts . Starting point: Hyannis, MA . The route: 60 miles on Massachusetts Highway 6A . What to expect: Few North American beaches compare to Cape Cod National Seashore in winter, where the snow filters through the dune grass and gathers on the beach like a monk's mandala. Worth hopping out, but if you want to stick to your car, a brief one-mile stretch between Truro and Provincetown offers the most scenic views. Where to stop: At any beach access point, massive black-and-white eiders (sea ducks) floating aloft the breakers and gulls battling head down into the bracing wind inspire us to dig into the sand and forge forward. Boardwalk strolls through Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Reserve and Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary offer additional protection for the birdsâand you. Parke County, Indiana . Starting point: Rockville, IN . The route: 24 miles on the Brown Driving Route (looping through Montezuma and Mecca via Howard Avenue and Strawberry Road) What to expect: Parke County's vibrantly red, covered bridges contrast sublimely with its snow-filled meadows, especially when reflected in the ice that stalls the river below. Thirty-one covered bridges cross the rivers and streams here, and this being Amish country, seeing horse-drawn carriages trot through them only adds to the atmosphere. Each of five well-known driving circuits takes in at least half a dozen of the photo ops. Where to stop: The Sim Smith Bridge is hauntedâa young girl and her uncle heard horse hooves approaching on the bridge, but the buggy never materialized, so it's saidâwhich makes for a spooky stop on a full-moon night. Travel + Leisure: Compare cruise ships . Northern Door County, Wisconsin . Starting point: Sturgeon Bay, WI . The route: 40 miles on Wisconsin Highway 57 . What to expect: Northern Door County provides the Upper Midwest with its own Cape Cod experience, a series of coastal towns, local shops, and individually-owned restaurants that invite winter escape. Like those who dive headfirst into the National Seashore, the bravest winter adventurers make it all the way to Gills Rock at the top of the peninsula. Where to stop: Newport State Beach contains 38 miles of trails, many of which are groomed for cross-country skiing. Lake Tahoe, Nevada . Starting point: Incline Village, NV . The route: 27 miles on Nevada Highway 28-E and US-50 . What to expect: Mountains reflect off one of North America's deepest lakes, filling the glassy surface with otherworldly imagery during any season, but especially resplendent in winter. Bring your camera and your skis, be they Nordic or alpine. You'll also find plenty of beaches from which to look upon some of the planet's clearest water. Where to stop: Sand Harbor, part of the 14,300-acre Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park, is an ideal place to dip your hands in the icy lake (it never freezes but does get as low as 37 degrees), before hitting the trails for a winter walk, snowshoe, or ski. Travel + Leisure: America's most scenic roads . Lakes to Locks Passage, New York . Starting Point: Waterford, NY . The Route: 190 miles on I-87 . What to Expect: Following the Champlain Trail from the confluence of the Erie and lesser-known Champlain Canals, through historic Ticonderoga and a score of other North Country villages, this National Scenic Byway provides plenty of history and scenery before arriving at the St. Lawrence River and Quebec. Where to Stop: History buffs make a point to stop at Fort Ticonderoga, among the most impressive structures that remain from the 18th century. Though widely associated with the American Revolution, the fort was actually built by the French during the French and Indian War in the 1750s. Great Smoky National Park, Tennessee and North Carolina . Starting Point: Gatlinburg, TN . The Route: 81 miles on US 321 and I-40E . What to Expect: As you drive toward Asheville, NC, Great Smoky Mountains National Park provides a wintry window into the southern alpine wilderness, with (often snowy) trails leading through stands of leafless frost-glistened forests. Best to keep two hands on the wheel and pull over to admire the subtle 4,928 feet of Mount Cammerer. Where to Stop: Few people from outside the South will believe you went skiing in Tennessee, so seize the opportunity at Ober Gatlinburg resort. Short on time? The 2.1-mile-long Aerial Tramway up there is a scenic treat in itself. Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming . Starting Point: Mammoth Hot Springs, WY . The Route: 52 miles on the Grand Loop Road . What to Expect: Yellowstone's summer traffic jams thin out to lightly populated wolf-spotting groups and the occasional bachelor bison (older males that have left the herd) that may have you applying the brakes. You can drive into the Lamar Valley to look for wolves, but bisecting the park to Old Faithful requires booking space on a snowcoach (reserve early). Where to Stop: The geysers look more impressive during winter than any other season so prioritize a stay in Old Faithful Snow Lodge. Ski, snowshoe, or walk upon miles of trails through the Upper Geyser Basin. The High Road to Taos, New Mexico . Starting Point: Pojoaque, NM . The Route: 52 miles on six state highways (503 to 520, 76, 75, 518, and finally 68) What to Expect: A two-hour journey into high desert beauty begins when you turn off US-285/84 about 17 miles north of Santa Fe: dry snowflakes hang on junipers and piÃ±on pines as you travel past the 14th-century NambÃ© Pueblo and wood-carving village of Cordova. Later, the snowcapped Truchas Peaks rise in the eastern distance, more than 13,000 feet in height, as the valley spreads below. Where to Stop: San JosÃ© de Gracia, located in Las Trampas, offers a prime example of a mid-18th-century adobe church, one of several along The High Road.

"(CNN) -- Imagine that a state creates a ""ministry of truth"" whose job it is to referee elections to make sure that candidates and activists didn't insinuate, exaggerate or otherwise spin their messaging. Any political speech the truth-o-crats determined to be insufficiently candid would carry criminal penalties. Sounds like a parable about the dangers of taking ""clean elections"" too far, right? Or a short story by George Orwell or Kurt Vonnegut? In the American tradition of political free-for-all, the idea that an omnipotent censor would vet stump speeches and ads against some government-designed Truth-o-meter is a joke. Unfortunately, this is no dystopia. By one count, about 20 states outlaw campaign distortions. Most notoriously, Ohio has a statute that prohibits making ""false statements"" about a candidate or ballot initiative. In one instance, former Rep. Steven Driehaus, D-Ohio, used it against an anti-abortion group that had attacked him in the 2010 election. That's the basis of a case now in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. A hearing last week in the case began with the claim that ""Driehaus voted for taxpayer-funded abortion."" That's good fodder for dinner-party conversation or TV talking heads, but it was surreal in that it ended up before the highest court in the land. There's no question that Driehaus voted for the bill at issue -- the Affordable Care Act -- so the only dispute is whether statutory text actually provides federal funding for abortions (a question of legal, economic and even theological interpretation). Alas, the Ohio law extends even past matters of interpretation. Its broad language also criminalizes rhetorical hyperbole. Legally speaking, Ohio's ban of lies and damn lies is inconsistent with the First Amendment. Indeed, disparaging political statements -- whether true, mostly true, mostly untrue or wholly fantastic -- are cornerstones of American democracy. Mocking and satire are as old as the republic. Just ask Thomas Jefferson, ""the son of a half-breed squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father."" Jefferson's 1800 campaign against John Adams would make a modern spin doctor blush -- and that's before James Callender, noted pamphleteer and ""scandalmonger,"" alleged that Jefferson had fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings (a charge largely confirmed nearly 200 years later). In the fierce election of 1828, supporters of John Quincy Adams called Andrew Jackson a ""slave-trading, gambling, brawling murderer."" Jacksonian partisans responded by accusing Adams of securing a prostitute for Czar Alexander I. Later that century, Grover Cleveland was asked at every campaign stop, ""Ma, ma, where's my pa?"" (Answer: Gone to the White House, ha ha ha!) More recently, we've debated draft dodging, Swift Boats and birth certificates, not to mention the assorted infidelities that are a political staple. Any of these allegations could generate a complaint to the Ohio Elections Commission and thus turn commonplace jibber-jabber into a protracted legal dispute. Yet ""truthiness"" -- a ""truth"" asserted ""from the gut"" or because it ""feels right"" -- is a key part of political discourse. After all, where would we be without the knowledge that Democrats are pinko-communist flag burners who want to tax churches and use the money to fund abortions so they can use the fetal stem cells to create pot-smoking lesbian ATF agents who will steal all the guns and invite the United Nations to take over America? Would we be better off electing Republicans, those assault-weapon-wielding maniacs who believe that George Washington and Jesus Christ incorporated the nation after a Gettysburg re-enactment and that the only thing wrong with the death penalty is that it isn't administered quickly enough to secular-humanist professors of Chicano studies? Laws that criminalize ""false"" speech don't replace smears and snark with ""just the facts."" Instead, they chill speech such that spin becomes silence. Supporters of Ohio's law believe that it somehow stops lies and insults, raising the level of discourse to that of an Oxford Union debate (which itself isn't that high, but that's another story). Not only does this hope stand in the face of political history, it disregards the fact that, in politics, truths are felt as much as they're known. When a red-meat Republican hears ""Obama is a socialist,"" or a bleeding-heart Democrat hears, ""Romney wants to throw granny off a cliff,"" he feels a truth more than thinking one. No state agency can change this fact, and any attempt to do so stifles vital political speech. Laws such as Ohio's are so absurd as to be laughable -- except that criminalizing political speech isn't funny. The Supreme Court should close the truth ministries once and for all.

"(CNN) -- Justin Timberlake is not afraid of reinvention. While other boy-band heartthrobs were still recycling the same hooks, the multitalented 30-year-old had moved on to a solo R&B career, fighting his own label to do non-bubblegum songs like ""SexyBack."" Now, Timberlake has decided to let his Grammys collect dust while he makes yet another leap: pop star to movie star. ""Friends with Benefits,"" opening today, marks the first time Timberlake's name has seen the top of a cast list. And it won't be the last. What's the secret to Timberlake's crossover success? No doubt he's talented, hard-working and easy on the eyes. But there's something else at play here, something rarely acknowledged in articles about JT's stylish clothes and beautiful girlfriends: . Justin Timberlake is a nerd. That's not to say he isn't cool. He's the cool nerd, the guy who makes cool seem attainable. Remember that popular guy in high school who wasn't a quarterback or homecoming king, whose sheer likability gave him a spot at the cool kids' table? Justin Timberlake isn't so far removed from that kid. Take a look at ""The Social Network,"" the Facebook-origin movie that put Timberlake, The Actor, on the map. JT plays Napster founder Sean Parker, the closest thing the film has to a rock star. When he saunters into a Silicon Valley restaurant, heads swivel. As Parker, Timberlake is charismatic and convincing, but what makes his performance great is a deep, intense vulnerability. Parker, we realize, is only a celebrity in the insular tech world; in the real world, he's just an asthmatic college dropout. He's a person who has carefully crafted his own hyper-cool image, an impersonation of what he thinks a tech-world celebrity (had there ever been such a thing before?) should be. At the end of the film, the cracks start to show, and our hearts break a little. Perhaps Timberlake played Parker so well because he, too, is a guy who has carefully curated his own image. Try to isolate him for a moment from his hit songs, his ""SNL"" skits, his movie trailers. Would you cast a guy like Justin -- the puppy-dog screen presence, the high breathy voice, the Brillo pad of hair -- as a leading man? Timberlake knows he's an unlikely candidate to fill Brad Pitt's shoes, which is why he's played his acting career like a chess game: making under-the-radar indie films and popping up casually on ""Saturday Night Live"" until he was suddenly on every movie screen. These days, Timberlake is frequently compared to Mark Wahlberg, another Top-40 teen idol who gave it up for a film career. But beyond the obvious, it's not a good analogy. Wahlberg was born a leading man, buff and intimidating with a sly smile and a natural swagger. When he became a movie star, he cut himself off completely from his now-embarrassing foray into rap. It's now amusing to think of Marky Mark and Mark Wahlberg as the same person, because the differences are so striking. Timberlake has a leading-man swagger, too -- but his seems carefully practiced, the way Fred Astaire would rehearse behind closed doors for hours to make his dancing seem effortless. His gestures, his jokes, appear as carefully chosen as his impeccable wardrobe. Remember, this is the guy who became a decent facsimile of a young Michael Jackson through sheer hard work and force of will. Unlike Wahlberg, Timberlake has never tried to distance himself from his teenybopper days. He knows we've all seen him as a 14-year-old in blond dreadlocks and head-to-toe denim. And that, too, is part of his charm. He makes cool seem attainable for the rest of us geeks. When his Tennessee awkwardness shows through his Hollywood persona, he's the first person to laugh it off. He's not the guy you'd expect to ""have you naked by the end of this song,"" as he sings in ""Rock Your Body"" -- and that's why he pulls it off so well. All of this makes Timberlake the perfect star for a time when the line between geeky and cool has become more of a zigzag. Like those Clark Kent glasses he wears in interviews, JT has found a way to be the best of both cultures. And two weeks ago, the teen-star-turned-pop-star-turned-film-star announced that he would be reinventing the social networking site MySpace. It's life imitating art -- and of all people, Justin Timberlake knows a little something about doing a great imitation.","What makes his ""Social Network"" performance great is a deep, intense vulnerability .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri has allegedly recorded a message telling militants fighting in Syria to unite. The message, which runs more than five minutes long, was posted on militant websites. Its authenticity could not be independently verified by CNN. In the message, al-Zawahiri calls upon all jihadi factions to stop infighting. ""Our hearts are bleeding, the heart of our Islamic nation is bleeding when we see the internal strife among the mujahedeen in Syria,"" he said. ""You are the hope of our Islamic nation in establishing an Islamic governance in the lands of Syria, the chosen land of jihad."" The words may provide verbal ammunition for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has long argued that his forces are fighting ""terrorists"" in the country's civil war. But rebels say that al-Assad allowed al Qaeda to grow in Syria in order to defame the revolution. Opinion: Syrian genocide needs justice . U.S. says it knew of photos in November . In a separate development, U.S. State Department officials told CNN on Thursday that it was November when the Obama administration found out about photos that allegedly show the Syrian regime committing mass torture. An activist showed the images to a State Department official on his laptop, officials said. But the administration did not act on the information because it did not possess the actual files, they said. The officials said they could not confirm the authenticity of the images, but they think they are genuine. CNN released a report about the existence of the photos Monday. The report, by a team of international legal and forensic experts, was based on thousands of photographs provided by a Syrian defector. The defector claimed to have worked as a photographer at a military hospital that received dead bodies from detention centers. Syria's Justice Ministry has categorically denied the allegations, branding the report, as ""politicized and lacking in objectivity and professionalism."" The Syrian crisis began in March 2011, when peaceful protesters calling for reforms were met by a violent government crackdown. Dissidents began calling for the ouster of al-Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for 42 years. The conflict spiraled into a civil war that has also ratcheted up sectarian strife between Sunni and Shiite Muslims across the region. Over the past few years, foreign militants have joined both sides of the war -- including fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon.

"Paris (CNN) -- The gesture couldn't have been more dramatic, nor the setting more grand: 78-year-old French writer and historian Dominique Venner chose the altar of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris to shoot himself in front of about 1,500 horrified visitors. Just before pulling the trigger, he had meticulously laid a letter on the altar for the police. Venner, a former paratrooper and member of the Secret Army Organization (OAS), a group opposed to Algeria's independence and which waged a war of terror against Charles de Gaulle and his government in the early 1960s, was a theorist of the French Extreme Right. Marine Le Pen, leader of the Extreme-Right National Front party, provoked controversy when immediately took to Twitter to salute Venner's ""political gesture,"" concluding that he had tried ""to wake France up."" ""Venner's models were ancient Greece and ancient Rome, he was a pagan and an anti-Christian but chose a highly symbolic place of western civilization to kill himself, "" commented Christophe Forcari in the French daily newspaper LibÃÂ©ration. Read more: Man kills himself at Notre Dame Cathedral . Lately, Venner's anger had focused on the same-sex marriage bill which became law last Saturday, and the abrogation of which, he thought, the French should seek in mass street protests. He dreamt, in fact, of a reactionary insurrection, a ""French Spring."" In a last post on his blog, he backed the anti-same-sex marriage march planned for this Sunday. He wrote that demonstrators were ""right to shout their impatience and anger"" and that laws could be overturned if the people shouted loudly enough. A xenophobe, he loathed multicultural France and called for radical and symbolic acts to ""reawaken the memory of our origins."" By committing suicide in such a fashion, Venner certainly hoped to show the way to like-minded radical militants; he recently wrote: ""sometimes words are not enough, they need to be substantiated by acts."" The four-month-long campaign on the same-sex marriage bill, during which supporters and protesters fought each other, sometimes violently, with hundreds of arrests, certainly antagonized the country in unexpected ways. If a majority of the French people backed equality of treatment and therefore civil union for all, with its strings of fiscal advantages, they did however split on the second part of the bill, and the question of adoption rights and access to IVF for gays and lesbians. Read more: Hollande signs same-sex marriage bill . In France, unlike in Britain for example, adoption and IVF for gay couples -- alongside automatic joint parenting rights -- was still illegal until last Saturday and remains controversial, simply because it touches on the highly sensitive question of family and what family is made of. Surveys have showed that the divide is both political and generational: The Left is, for the most part, in favour of the same-sex marriage law while the hard Right, and leaders of the French Catholics, Muslims and Jews oppose it. The young, the educated and women are the main supporters of Hollande's law. The National Assembly was the theater where such French uneasiness played out: The bill required 172 hours of heated and angry discussion, and was the most debated in recent history. Even the laws introducing abortion in 1974, and the abolition of the death penalty in 1981, required fewer hours of debate in parliament and proved less contentious. France is the ninth country in Europe (and the 14th in the world) to adopt same-sex marriage. The first civil union of this kind, between two gay men, will take place in Montpellier next week. It will likely take years for the whole of French society to adjust to this new reality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Agnes Poirier.","Historian and writer Dominique Venner shot himself inside Notre Dame Cathedral .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- In her first interview since being released from jail, Paris Hilton told CNN's Larry King on Wednesday that she has never used drugs, isn't a big drinker, and although she feels her incarceration was unwarranted, God had a reason for putting her there. Paris Hilton talks to Larry King on ""Larry King Live"" Wednesday night. ""Don't serve the time; let the time serve you,"" Hilton said. ""I have a new outlook on life."" The 26-year-old hotel heiress was released from jail early Tuesday after being sentenced to 45 days in jail for driving on a license that was suspended after she pleaded no contest in January to alcohol-related reckless driving. Her jail term was cut almost in half for good behavior. Being incarcerated, Hilton said, provided ""time to get to know myself"" and she has emerged from the jail cell with a determination to eliminate the bad elements, and bad friends, from her life. She also promised King, ""I'm just going to follow all the laws."" Grilled about the friends she had to sacrifice, she replied, ""I've gotten rid of a lot of people."" Asked for names, she said, ""I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but they know who they are."" During her 23 days in jail, Hilton said she meditated, read letters from fans, talked to other inmates through the vents, wrote in her journal and read the Bible, though she couldn't cite a favorite passage when asked. It was also nice to have a little privacy, she said, and to ""be away from all the flashes for a while.""  Watch what Paris watchers say to that Â» . Her imprisonment also reversed a mental disorder she said she had suffered from all her life. Asked by King if her time in jail cured her claustrophobia, she said, ""Now that I'm out of there, yes."" But there were rough times, too, she said. The food ""wasn't that tasty,"" she said. Being strip-searched was the most humiliating experience of her life and one Sunday visit from her parents was especially emotional for her, she said. ""It was my first Father's Day I couldn't give my dad a hug, and that was really hard on me,"" she said, describing how she was separated from her visitors by glass. When she arrived at the Century Regional Detention Facility, her claustrophobia became too much to handle, she said. She couldn't sleep. She couldn't eat. She suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, she said. Her deteriorating mental condition is what prompted Sheriff Lee Baca -- much to the chagrin of the judge who sentenced Hilton -- to release her to house arrest after consulting physicians. ""He thought it'd be better for everybody if I just went home,"" she said. An angry prosecutor and judge demanded that she be returned to jail. ""Ten minutes before the police arrived I'm yanked out of bed"" and told the news, she said, describing the situation as ""crazy; it was pure madness."" Hilton said that her lawyer told her that her license was valid. ""I never would've driven on a suspended license. I get followed by paparazzi all day. Why would I have the audacity to do that?"" Asked if she got a ""raw deal,"" she replied that she had and that she was shocked when her 45-day sentence was handed down because ""that doesn't happen ever."" Her lawyers had predicted she'd get community service, she said. ""But I don't know. Even though I hate it, I'm glad it happened in a way because this really changed my life forever, and I feel stronger than ever."" Perhaps the world's most famous socialite, Hilton said she has picked up her life and career -- which includes modeling, perfumes, clothing, movies, singing and television shows -- where she left them for an 8-by-12-foot cell three weeks ago. But despite her reputation, Hilton said it won't be hard to give up the party heartiness that has helped make her famous. Why? Because she doesn't have a problem, never has -- those are just ""stories"" that the media have made up about her, she said. Asked three times if she has ever used or been addicted to drugs, she replied flatly, ""No."" Asked if she was a big drinker, Hilton told King, ""I'm not really into it. I think socially people do sometimes when they go out, but it's not something that I really care about."" She added, ""People make up so many crazy stories. The things I read about and things I see is not the person who I am. It really baffles me sometimes when I read things -- the places I've never been, people I've never met -- it's really shocking to me."" The buildup to the much-anticipated interview was palpable. Passersby may have thought a head of state was arriving at CNN's Los Angeles studio Wednesday, but the hullabaloo was for Hilton. With scores of onlookers and paparazzi gathered behind police barriers on the side streets -- still and video cameras perched eagerly -- a dozen Los Angeles police officers and several private security guards carefully watched the alley behind the building on Sunset Boulevard. Hilton arrived in a black Cadillac Escalade, wearing white-rimmed sunglasses and a cream-colored minidress with lace sleeves. She was hustled through a vacant lobby -- cleared especially for her arrival -- and upstairs to the studio where King has prodded news makers for CNN for more than two decades. King, decked out in a purple button-down, polka-dot tie and his trademark suspenders, was promptly told that Hilton would need 15 minutes in hair and makeup before beginning one of the most sought-after interviews in recent history. The gambling Web site Bodog was taking wagers on what comments Hilton would make during the interview. Odds were, according to the Web site, Hilton would discuss finding God in jail and the mental health issues from which she suffered while incarcerated. Bodog.com founder Calvin Ayre said taking odds on Hilton ""seemed like a natural fit for us. The vast majority of our odds are based on the most common questions being asked by the public."" But whether Hilton is serious about reinventing -- or dismantling -- herself remains to be seen. Time will be the determinant of whether Hilton has changed her wily ways or if this is a spurious attempt to rebuild a battered image, said Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. ""I think some of it could be sincere, and some of it could be her handlers,"" she said. ""If it's not sincere it will crack pretty fast."" It is possible, Levenson said, that the ""transformative experience"" of being jailed could have had a profound effect on the heiress, and whether it sticks will depend on what kind of reinforcement and recognition she receives for being good. Levenson said she is unsure whether Hilton has the necessary tools to be a ""great contributor to American society, because she's been playing somewhat of a vacuous role."" But, Levenson acknowledges, being a good girl may not bode well for business -- ""Sometimes society likes the naughty Paris Hilton. We like a bad girl."" After Wednesday's hourlong interview, Hilton walked out of the studio and chatted with two children and posed for a photo with them outside the studio's control room. Of the interview, she told a producer in the hallway, ""I was nervous, but Larry's so sweet."" E-mail to a friend .","Paris Hilton: ""I'm just going to follow all the laws""

Erick Munoz filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against John Peter Smith Hospital, both with the same goal: to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial. ""Marlise Munoz is legally dead, and to further conduct surgical procedures on a deceased body is nothing short of outrageous,"" her husband contends in the motion. Notably, officials at the Fort Worth, Texas, hospital where 33-year-old Marlise Munoz is have not publicly declared her dead (though they have not disputed her husband's assertions either). Erick Munoz -- like his wife, a paramedic by training -- said the doctors told him Marlise ""had lost all activity in her brain stem,"" and an accompanying chart stated she was ""brain dead,"" according to his lawsuit. The hospital referred requests for comment to the Tarrant County district attorney's office, which said it will defend the medical facility against the lawsuit. It is legal counsel for John Peter Smith Hospital ""in a number of civil areas."" Noting it first learned of the legal action just before noon Tuesday, the office said it ""will file a response in due course"" but won't have any further comment now ""because litigation is pending."" Hospital spokesman J.R. Labbe said last month that doctors were simply trying to obey a Texas law that states that ""you cannot withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient."" And last week, Labbe told CNN that the hospital believed ""the courts are the appropriate venue to provide clarity, direction and resolution in this matter."" Munoz's husband responds by saying that ""Marlise cannot possibly be a pregnant patient -- Marlise is dead."" Furthermore, he argued that her wishes -- relayed, he said, in conversations but not in writing that she not be on ""life-sustaining"" measures when she is brain dead -- shouldn't be treated differently than a man or other woman simply because of her pregnancy. Mom of pregnant woman on life support: Change the law . ""Marlise has a fundamental right to make medical decisions regarding her own body,"" her husband contended in the motion. ""... To take those rights away from Marlise, and force her to be subject to various medical procedures simply because she is pregnant, is a gross violation of her constitutional right."" As the lawsuit details, the story began at 2 a.m. on November 26, when Erick found his wife unconscious on the kitchen floor. At the time, she was 14 weeks' pregnant with the couple's second child. Soon after that, she was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital, where Erick Munoz claims he was told his wife ""was for all purposes brain dead."" The family also says the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen. In the lawsuit, he claims subsequent measures taken at the hospital -- and, in turn, the state law used to justify them -- amount ""to nothing more than the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body against the expressed will of the deceased and her family."" ""Marlise Munoz's death is a horrible and tragic circumstance, but by no means should (the hospital) be entitled to continue cutting into her deceased body in front of her husband and family under the guise of 'life-sustaining' treatment,"" according to the lawsuit. Tom Mayo, a Southern Methodist University law professor who helped write the applicable Texas law, said he believes the hospital is misinterpreting it. ""She's not a patient anymore,"" Mayo said. ""And so I don't see how we can use a provision of the law that talks about treating or not treating a patient in a case where we really don't have a patient."" But Sunny Hostin, a CNN legal analyst, said that she thinks the state statute as written is ""ambiguous"" and ""vague."" ""When you have these murky areas, you have to go to court, because courts provide clarity, courts provide direction,"" Hostin said. ""And that's why I think the lawsuit is the right thing ... to jump to the conclusion."" When 'life support' is really 'death support' CNN's Elizabeth Landau and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","NEW: Analyst: Courts can ""provide clarity"" on a ""vague"" state statute .

"(CNN) -- The FBI's Ten Most Wanted list now includes a man suspected of killing a young New York mother and her toddler son execution-style in 2010. Juan Elias Garcia, who the FBI calls an ""enthusiastic murderer,"" now has a $100,000 reward on his head. ""Garcia's callous disregard for human life resulted in the senseless murder of a young mother and her helpless 2-year-old son,"" said George Venizelos, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York Field Office, on the agency's website. Garcia is alleged to be a member of the violent MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, gang. He's thought to be hiding in El Salvador. The FBI said a romantic entanglement and gang rivalries lay at the heart of slayings. Slaying victim Vanessa Argueta, 19, is said to have had a romantic relationship with Garcia -- and she's also believed to have had ties to two rival gangs: the 18th Street gang and the Latin Kings. ""They were going to kill her for disrespecting the gang,"" said Special Agent James Lopez in the FBI release. ""It is unacceptable for MS-13 members to have girls they associate with be involved with rival gang members."" The FBI said that under the guise of an invitation to dinner in Central Islip, New York, Garcia coerced Argueta and her 2-year-old son into the woods. There, they were met by two co-conspirators -- members of Mara Salvatrucha -- and Argueta was murdered in front of her son. The FBI said the same gun was then used to kill the little boy. Considered armed and dangerous, Garcia is 5 foot, 4 inches and weighs 125 pounds. He was 17 and answered to the nickname ""Cruzito"" at the time of the slayings on February 4, 2010. ""His appointment to the FBI's Top Ten list illustrates not only the seriousness of his crimes but our commitment to seeking justice for his victims,"" said Venizelos. The FBI requests that anyone with information on Garcia contact its New York Field Office at 212-384-1000, a nearby law enforcement agency or U.S. Embassy or Consulate. People can also submit a tip online.

"(CNN) -- Josef Fritzl, the Austrian man accused of keeping his daughter in a cellar for decades and fathering her seven children, will go on trial March 16 on six charges including murder and incest. Josef Fritzl admitted fathering seven children by his daughter during her 24-year captivity. The Austrian Press Agency reported Thursday the trial was expected to last about five days and be held behind closed doors. Further details about the case would be announced Friday, it said. Fritzl, 73, was charged in November with incest and the repeated rape of his daughter, Elisabeth, for 24 years. But he was also charged with the murder of one of the children he fathered with her, an infant who died soon after birth. State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek said Michael Fritzl died from lack of medical care. In all, Fritzl faces six charges at trial: murder, involvement in slave trade (slavery), rape, incest, assault, and deprivation of liberty, Sedlacek's office said. If convicted, he could face life in prison. The case first came to light in April 2008 when Elisabeth's then-19-year-old daughter, Kerstin, became seriously ill with convulsions. Elisabeth persuaded her father to allow Kerstin to be taken to a hospital for treatment. Hospital staff became suspicious of the case and alerted police, who discovered the family members in the cellar. Fritzl confessed to police that he raped his daughter, kept her and their children in captivity, and burned the body of the dead infant in an oven in the house. Elisabeth told police the infant was one of twins who died a few days after birth. When Elisabeth gained her freedom, she told police her father began sexually abusing her at age 11. On August 8, 1984, her father enticed her into the basement, where he drugged her, put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room, she told police. Fritzl explained Elisabeth's disappearance in 1984 by saying the 18-year-old girl had run away from home. He backed up the story with letters he forced Elisabeth to write. Elisabeth Fritzl and all but three of her children lived in the specially designed cellar beneath her father's home in Amstetten, Austria, west of Vienna. The other three children lived upstairs with Fritzl and his wife; Fritzl had left them on his own doorstep, pretending his ""missing"" daughter Elisabeth had dropped them off. Under Austrian law, if Fritzl is convicted on several offenses, he will be given the sentence linked to the worst crime. In addition to murder, he will face the following charges: .","Josef Fritzl accused of keeping daughter captive for decades, on trial March 16 .

"London, England (CNN) -- Mohamed al Fayed, whose son died in the car crash that killed Princess Diana, has sold the iconic British department store Harrods, the advisers to the sale announced Saturday. Al Fayed, who has been chairman of the store for 25 years, has decided to retire and spend more time with his children and grandchildren, said Ken Costa, chairman of Lazard International. Al Fayed sold Harrods to Qatar Holding, which will become only the fifth owner of the store since it was created in 1849, Costa said. ""In reaching the decision to retire, he wished to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would be continued, and that the team that he has built up would be encouraged to develop the foundations that he has laid."" Costa said in a statement. ""Qatar Holding was specifically chosen by the (al Fayed family) as they had both the vision and financial capacity to support the long-term successful growth of Harrods."" Qatar Holding is a fully owned affiliate of Qatar Petroleum, a state-owned company based in Doha. It was in the mid-1980s that al Fayed bought Harrods, a high-end department store in London's exclusive Knightsbridge neighborhood. In 2005, he unveiled a bronze statue inside the store featuring Princess Diana and his son, Dodi Fayed. Titled ""Innocent Victims,"" the statue was meant to depict the pair in eternal happiness together, al Fayed said at the time. Dodi Fayed and Diana died in 1997 when the car they were riding in crashed in a Paris tunnel as they were pursued by paparazzi. The Sunday Times Rich List two weeks ago put al Fayed's personal fortune at Â£650 million ($962 million). It said he was only one of three people among the top 100 names on the list to have increased their wealth. ""What recession? Not for Harrods this time,"" al Fayed told the paper. Al Fayed, who is Egyptian, has lived in Britain since the 1970s and regards it as his home, but he has repeatedly been denied a British passport. Harrods was founded by London grocer Charles Henry Harrod, who originally set up shop in east London. Harrod wanted to escape the inner-city filth and capitalize on trade from the upcoming Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, so in 1849 he took over a small shop near the park in what was then the new district of Knightsbridge, on the site of the current store, according to Harrods. It was Harrods that had the very first sale, the Winter Clearance of 1894. They also introduced the world's first escalator in 1898, according to the store -- with brandy at the top for nervous customers. In December 1983, the Irish Republican Army detonated a car bomb near Harrods that killed six people during the Christmas shopping rush. Harrods was starting to find itself outmoded in the 1980s when al Fayed took over, purchasing it as part of the House of Fraser Group for Â£615 million, the store says. Under al Fayed, Harrods went through a major refurbishment that included constructing the Egyptian Escalator, a $30 million ""homage to ancient Egypt.""","Harrods was founded by London grocer Charles Henry Harrod in 1849 .

"(CNN) -- Remember being a kid, stuck home from school because you were sick, and ""The Price is Right"" would come on? I was that kid, and Ben Blatt was that kid, too. The difference between us is that when I was choosing college classes by their attendance policy, Blatt graduated from Harvard with a degree in applied math -- and then used what he learned to figure out how to win at ""The Price is Right."" When Blatt, a staff writer at Slate, discovered that there were collections of data based on the outcomes of the over 70 pricing games from the show, the mathematician inside leaped at the chance to look for patterns, and he found a few places where a person could not only do better than chance, but even win 100% of the time! Now, a couple caveats: This is just based on a few years of data (Blatt says each game is played about 10 times a year) so the samples aren't perfect, and you can't use math to win every game (so, sadly, Plinko perfection remains painfully out of reach). However, he outlines a couple tips that could help you up your game at home -- or even, should you get the chance, on set. Bet better . The game -- Contestant's Row: The first stop for anyone on the show is ""Contestant's Row,"" where four players chosen from the audience bet on a featured prize, and the person closest to the correct price without going over wins. Blatt went through show transcripts for five years and compiled the data to figure out what is best to do. The tip: Bet $1 higher than the highest bid. According to Blatt's data, the last person to bid wins 35% of the time, but if they guessed $1 higher than the highest bid, they would win 53.8% of the time. Why it works: People are afraid to overbid, because you definitely lose if you bid too high, so they typically bid a bit lower than what they think the actual price is. Betting $1 more takes advantage of this. Clean their clock . The game -- Clock Game: Guess the exact price of two prizes in less than 30 seconds. On a wrong guess, the host will tell you if you need to guess higher or lower. The tip: Assume both prizes are worth between $500 and $1,000 then cut the difference in half and repeat. According to Blatt's analysis based on more than 75 games, this strategy works 100% of the time. Why it works: Splitting the difference each time is the fastest way to home in on the correct price (It's technically called a 'binary search') and should keep the times you have to guess on each prize below 10. Since you get unlimited guesses, you just need to be quick about each guess and victory is yours! Stop the yodeling . The game -- Cliff Hangers: Known to most of us as ""the yodeling game,"" players guess the two-digit price of three items. A mountain climbing figure clad in lederhosen makes his way one step closer to the top of a mountain for every dollar your guess is from the actual price. If he travels over 25 steps (if your guesses total more than $25 off) then he falls and you lose. The tip: Guess $19 the first time, and then guess $11 more than the price of the previous item on your second and third guesses. Why it works: Blatt's research found that each prize is slightly more expensive than the prize before it, so the step up of $11 is in the sweet spot to compensate for the increase. Based on over 50 games, this strategy worked 100% of the time. The Magic Pick . The game -- Magic Number: The contestant is shown two prizes and has to guess a number that is between the prices of the two prizes. The tip: Guess $2,250. Why it works: Because of math. Blatt crunched all the numbers from over 50 plays of Magic Number, and found that guessing $2,250 would win 79% of the time. The average contestant only won 44% of the time. Blatt's article outlines some more strategies (including another game where he found a strategy that works 100% of the time) and includes a ""Price is Right"" cheat sheet that's so complete, it even earned a retweet from Drew Carey, the show's host. Bob Barker will celebrate 90th birthday on 'Price is Right'","Slate staff writer Ben Blatt crunched the numbers to find ways to win on ""Price is Right""
On Contestant's Row, use the $1 higher strategy, he says .

"(CNN) -- Funny thing about fish: You can see right through them in their infancy and watch their organs develop. That gave scientists looking into the aftereffects of 2010's Gulf of Mexico oil spill the chance to watch the growing hearts of large commercial species like tuna and amberjack after exposing them in laboratories to oil collected from the undersea blowout. The results ranged from abnormal heartbeats in fish exposed to low concentrations of oil to ""severely malformed and malfunctioning hearts"" at high levels, said John Incardona, an environmental toxicologist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Incardona is the lead author of a NOAA-led study published Monday that warned those heart defects could lead to widespread losses of popular deep-sea fish in the gulf. He and his colleagues exposed bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna and amberjack embryos to concentrations of oil ""that mimicked what happened in the Gulf of Mexico,"" he said. Even where the volatile compounds in oil made up as little as one millionth of a gram per liter, some fish ended up with heart problems, they reported. ""Those fish would in all likelihood survive the immediate effects of oil exposure, but would also probably end up with a milder heart malformation that could reduce their aerobic performance -- which for fish, means swimming,"" Incardona said. Fishermen hauled in more than 1,500 tons of tuna and amberjack across the gulf in 2012, according to NOAA catch statistics. Scientists have already tracked a sharp decline in bluefin tuna, but the findings may spell trouble for other big fish as well, Incardona and his colleagues reported. How extensive any losses may be is still under study, but estimates may come ""in a few months,"" said Barbara Block, a Stanford University biologist and co-author of Monday's study. The spill struck at a time when fish were spawning, with their embryos and larvae floating on the surface of the gulf. Since bluefin tuna in particular take eight years or more to grow up, the ""the trickle-down impact of this oil spill will take a long time to manifest upon the population on a level that one could see,"" Block said. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the 25th anniversary of what had been the worst U.S. oil spill -- the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska. It's one of the ""key studies"" commissioned by the federal government to gauge the damage left behind by the Deepwater Horizon disaster, NOAA official Tom Brosnan said. ""It's one of the most difficult aspects of this oil spill to the particular population that we're talking about,"" Block said. But since bluefin have been extensively tagged electronically, both before and after the spill, ""those data sets exist, and they're currently being explored to get answers to those questions."" Millions of barrels of crude poured into the gulf after the April 2010 explosion that sank the drill rig Deepwater Horizon off Louisiana and killed 11 workers. Well owner BP has already paid $43 billion in cleanup, restoration costs and fines for the 2010 blowout, and an ongoing federal court case in New Orleans could add several billion more on top of that. BP immediately disputed Monday's findings. ""The paper provides no evidence to suggest a population-level impact on tuna, amberjack or other pelagic fish species in the Gulf of Mexico,"" the company said in a written statement. ""The oil concentrations used in these lab experiments were rarely seen in the gulf during or after the Deepwater Horizon accident. In addition, the authors themselves note that it is nearly impossible to determine the early life impact to these species. To overcome this challenge, it would take more information than what's presented in this paper."" But Fernando Galvez, an environmental toxicologist at Louisiana State University, said the samples to which the embryos were exposed were ""environmentally realistic."" The effects seen in individual fish ""have very strong indications for population-level impacts,"" he said. ""You mess up the heart, you mess up the ability of species like this to do simple functions like swim to catch its prey,"" said Galvez, the co-author of a 2013 study that pointed to similar problems among fish in coastal marshes hit by oil. BP also disputed those findings. Opinion: After 25 years, Exxon Valdez oil spill hasn't ended . More about oil spills .

"(CNN) -- The head of Australian soccer has vowed ""to throw the book"" at the men charged with match-fixing in a lower league competition -- which has been described as the worst such scandal in the country's sporting history. Nine people were arrested on Sunday, and six of them were charged in court Monday, including the coach of Victorian Premier League team Southern Stars, a group of his players and a Malaysian national. Five of those involved were British players who had been reportedly been offered to the Melbourne-based club at the start of the season on a non-payment basis. The Australian Football Federation (FFA) website said the arrests were made after it received data on suspicious betting patterns involving the Southern Stars in August, which it passed on to Victorian state police. ""Integrity measures put in place by football have been effective in detecting this activity,"" FFA chief David Gallop told reporters Sunday. ""From the FFA's point of view we'll initiate proceedings under our own codes of conduct. You can be sure that we will throw the book at them. ""That means life bans on a worldwide basis."" Police said more than $2 million had been bet on the team, which is bottom of its division -- a second-tier competition below the national A-League. Gerry Gsubramanian, 45, is accused of being the contact man for overseas betting syndicates who organized with the players the outcomes of matches. ""He receives phone calls. He is given advice on how the Southern Stars players are to perform,"" Detective acting senior sergeant Scott Poynder told the court, according to the Australian Associated Press. ""Video showed some of the players were doing some unusually poor play. For that work he received payment. Some of the bets are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars."" Gallop said he had been told by police it was considered an ""isolated issue."" ""This highlights the fact that lower league games, which aren't under the scrutiny of things like a global television broadcast, are potentially more susceptible to this kind of activity,"" Gallop said. ""At this stage the police have indicated to us that they are looking at an isolated issue in Victoria and we need to be guided by the police in that regard."" The controversy adds to a difficult year for Australian sport, which has been rocked by the drug scandals involving leading Australian Football League team Essendon as well as the country's rugby league competition. ""This was flagged earlier this year by the Australian Crime Commission that there were links with organized crime, trafficking of performance-enhancing drugs and match-fixing,"" journalist Jim Wilson of the Seven Network told CNN's World Sport. ""People were saying there's no match-fixing in Australian sport, and then this comes to light. It's a lower grade competition ... but it's the exotic betting and the middle-men involved that really sends shockwaves through Australian sport. ""Bets from India, Asia, Singapore, China on these local teams. I think you'll find that there are other sports that will be investigated and are under the spotlight as far as the Australian Federal Police is concerned.

"(CNN) -- When the British comedian Spike Milligan wrote a memoir about his experiences during World War II, he called it ""Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall."" Eli Roth and Brad Pitt play some bloodthirsty Allied soldiers in ""Inglourious Basterds."" Unlike Milligan, Quentin Tarantino was born 40 years too late to have played an active role in that enterprise, but at least he shares Milligan's chutzpah. Beginning with the precaution ""Once upon a time in Nazi-Occupied France ..."" -- part homage to Sergio Leone, part disclaimer of historical authenticity -- ""Inglourious Basterds"" doesn't pretend to give us the war as it was, but as it should have been. In this outrageous revisionist revenge fantasy, not only do the Jews resist Hitler -- in the form of a crack U.S. guerrilla unit operating behind enemy lines and outside official jurisdiction -- but they terrorize the German army with the bloodcurdling ferocity of their reprisals. When Brad Pitt's drawling Lt. Aldo Raine tells his platoon of misfits and sociopaths that each owes him 100 German scalps, it's not an idle pleasantry. Despite Pitt's sadism, this ""Dirty Dozen"" redux -- inspired by Enzo Castellari's 1978 exploitation film ""The Inglorious Bastards"" -- turns out to be the sketchiest component in an unexpectedly elaborate design dominated by Christoph Waltz's arch villain, Col. Hans Landa. Watch the stars talk about making the movie Â» . Waltz will be unknown to most American audiences -- he was certainly unknown to me -- but he's nothing less than sensational as the silky, polyglot SS officer charged by the Fuhrer to root out the remaining Jews in France. The long, long first sequence -- or ""chapter,"" as Tarantino terms it -- is essentially a 20-minute-plus two-character scene between Landa and a French farmer (played by Denis Menochet), where the SS man most graciously presumes on his host's wary hospitality, flattering him and his family, even complimenting his milk. The man is a tease, but a deadly one. With every perfectly enunciated phrase, he turns the screws tighter and tighter, up to the point where the poor farmer is ready to tell him everything. It's a masterful scene, bleakly comic and incredibly suspenseful, and as bold in its way as anything Tarantino has done before. (Who starts an adventure movie with 30 pages of dialogue?) Before it is done, we have developed a powerful antipathy to this brilliant, vicious fellow, Landa; it is clear that, like so many of the most memorable screen villains, he is a man we will love to hate. Tarantino doesn't hold back on nasty Nazis -- Goebbels and Hitler also figure, as well as Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), a handsome young infantryman and movie buff who has become a national hero after shooting more than a hundred GIs, and who is now starring as himself in Goebbels' latest propaganda film. On the other side of the equation, we find a glamorous German movie star who is actually an agent for the Allies (Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark) and Michael Fassbender as a British agent, Lt. Archie Hicox, sent as a liaison between Bridget and the ""Basterds"" because of his background as a film critic. (Only in a Tarantino movie do you find heroic critics.) And then there's Shosanna Dreyfus (the excellent Melanie Laurent), improbably  the owner-operator of a Parisian movie theater, the site on which all the major characters -- including der Fuhrer -- converge for Zoller's premiere. In this film, the cinema is everywhere and everything. For two and a half hours in the dark, anything goes. Some critics have taken exception to this hubris, even on moral grounds. Yet the movies have always exploited war and plundered history. Tarantino is just more up front about repurposing it than most. That first scene is no anomaly. Words speak louder than action, and most of the brutality comes veiled in cagey cat-and-mouse conversation. It's so intricately constructed, sometimes, that the film threatens to turn into a screenwriting master class and you wish Tarantino would just get on with the plot. But then, of course, he does, and engineers the kind of climax that threatens to bring the house down. ""Inglourious Basterds"" may or may not get Tarantino's career (and its producers, The Weinstein Company) back on track. It's hard to see it converting many skeptics, but the filmmaker's fans should be more than satisfied, and curious newbies will discover a dense, literate, audacious and prodigious talent, still one of the best of his generation.

"(CNN) -- The escalation of protests across Egypt on Sunday has prompted businesses and governments to evacuate their citizens and clients from the country. Turkey's semiofficial news agency Anadolu Ajansi stated that two planes were headed to Egypt Sunday to begin transporting Turkish citizens out of the country. The U.S. Embassy has been closed indefinitely, according to embassy spokeswoman Elizabeth Coulton, although it is offering 24-hour emergency assistance. PBS travel-show host Regina Fraser, currently in Egypt filming an episode of her show ""Grannies on Safari,"" has been frustrated by the lack of information. ""I'm going to tell you briefly that I contacted the embassy here two or three days ago, and no one answered. No one answered,"" said Fraser. ""The phone just kept ringing."" The information pipeline has improved with the addition of more people to take calls and handle e-mails, the U.S. State Department said Sunday. The staff of the Cairo Embassy has been overwhelmed by inquiries and the State Department now has a 24-7 task force and call centers, said Assistant Secretary of State Janice L. Jacobs. Radio and TV, along with websites and telephones, are being used to provide travel updates, she said. Charter flights will begin taking thousands of government dependents, nonessential employees and private American citizens out of Cairo on Monday. Officials are looking at Istanbul, Turkey; Nicosia, Cyprus; and Athens, Greece, as possible destinations, although the list was not finalized Sunday afternoon, Jacobs said. Fraser is currently stranded on a Nile River cruise boat in Luxor. She said someone at the embassy picked up the phone on Sunday and transferred her call to a recording advising callers to visit the U.S. government website. ""There is no internet here in Egypt,"" Fraser said. ""How could I find out information if the internet is not working?"" Fraser said she wasn't aware that flights to the U.S. would be available on Monday until informed by CNN. ""Many people just want to get out,"" Fraser said. Laura Murphy, a fellow river cruise passenger, told CNN that the ship's captain anchored the boat in Luxor after being warned against docking at any of the stops along the Nile because those areas may be unsafe for tourists. Murphy said two men with plane tickets to Cairo were stuck in Luxor because the plane never showed up. ""You cannot get away by water. You cannot take public transportation because it is unsafe and you cannot fly,"" Murphy said. ""I'm safe but trapped."" U.S. officials are advising stranded travelers to stay put until help arrives. ""We right now are asking people to limit their movements as much as possible and wait for the additional information that we will have on the charter flights that will be leaving,"" said Jacobs. Jacobs called on friends and family members with internet access to try to contact their loved ones in Egypt to give them online information that tourists in Egypt currently cannot access. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program on Sunday that ""thankfully, we do not have any reports of any American citizens killed or injured"" in Egypt's anti-government demonstrations. The U.S. State Department was making arrangements to provide transportation to ""safe haven locations"" in Europe. From those locations, U.S. citizens must make their own travel plans and reimburse the government for their flights out of Egypt, the embassy said in a statement. According to senior State Department officials, there are 380 government employees at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, and 760 spouses and children living with them in Egypt. The television news service Al Arabiya broadcast an unconfirmed report that eight commercial aircraft from Saudi Arabia were on their way to evacuate Saudis from Egypt. Meanwhile, 500 Jordanians, most of them students, arrived in Amman on Sunday, according to Mohammed Kayed, spokesman for the nation's Foreign Ministry. The ministry is in contact with the Jordanian Embassy in Cairo and was working to help book flights on Royal Jordanian airline for Jordanian citizens. Royal Jordanian said on its website it operated four scheduled and two extra flights between Amman and Cairo on Sunday ""in order to transport Jordanian citizens who wish to come back to the Kingdom, in light of the exceptional conditions prevailing in Eygpt.""

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, just two days before the Boston Marathon bombing anniversary, we witnessed yet another act of unspeakable violence aimed at dividing our communities along the lines of faith. The motivation for the shootings outside Kansas City is still under investigation, but we know that a white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan leader is accused of shooting people outside a Jewish community center and Village Shalom, a retirement home. Three people died in what is just the most recent deeply misguided act of violence aimed at severing the values each and every American cherishes most deeply. As we remember the lives taken a year ago in Boston, we also mourn and pray for the victims and their families in Kansas. One of us is a pastor and the other a rabbi of congregations in and near Boston. We both had identical reactions when we first learned of the Boston Marathon bombings last year. Was this another 9/11? Whom did we know who might be directly affected -- runners, first responders, spectators on the finish line? We worried about our colleagues at Old South Church, directly on the finish line, and Trinity Church in Copley Square, one block away. Similar to what we imagine interfaith leaders in Kansas started to do Sunday, we immediately began to call people and try to determine how to minister to our congregations and the city at large. We had both been involved in building relationships across religious lines for years; under the auspices of the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization and our individual efforts, we had joined together Christians, Muslims and Jews to build bridges of respect, tolerance and affection. In the year that has followed the bombing, Temple Israel of Boston was honored to host Imam Suhaib Webb of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center for a special service celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. Webb was joined at the temple by more than 100 members of his own congregation and by exceptional clergy and congregants from Boston's Christian Community in a joint celebration of the vision of life. Webb will also be the featured speaker at Old South Church's evening of remembrance on Tuesday night, which will honor the victims and brave first responders. The church will be filled with members of every faith from greater Boston. If the goal of the tragedy in Boston or the most recent act of despicable violence in Kansas is to sow fear and to divide us against one another, then our own lived experience is a testament to their failure. Last year's senseless attack has been repudiated by our congregations in the strongest and most profound way possible, and in the process we are stronger than ever. Looking back, we cannot help but recognize that by a combination of heroism, compassion, faith and will, the tragedy of the marathon bombing has brought us closer together and strengthened the ties between our communities. On the anniversary of last year's terrible attack and the violence in Kansas on Sunday, all of our congregations stand united in praying for the victims, their families and those who were grievously injured. We cannot bring back those people who were so senselessly taken, and we know that the void left by their loss can never truly be filled. We cannot restore lost limbs or heal the physical wounds. However, we can choose a better future for ourselves and for our nation -- one grounded in our common humanity, and in our expressions of faith and hope for the future, whether we are Muslims, Christians, Jews, adherents of other faiths or secular citizens who share a commitment to repair and renew the health and well-being of our cities, nation and the world.","Writers: Like Boston bombings, Kansas shootings meant to divide people along lines of faith .

"(CNN) -- Syrian military airstrikes hit parts of the country's largest city Thursday, killing at least 33 people and injuring several others, the UK-based opposition group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The airstrikes were the latest in a string of attacks reported in Aleppo, the northwest Syrian city that has been a hotly contested area in Syria's civil war. A day earlier, Syrian forces dropped barrel bombs on an opposition-held area of Aleppo, killing 25 children, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The unrest comes amid Syria's three-year civil war pitting government forces against rebels trying to end the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The government intends to hold elections June 3. Al-Assad, whose family has had a tight grip on power for 43 years, is running for another term. The United Nations is asking the government to reconsider the election because of the war. More than 100,000 people, including many civilians, have been killed, according to the United Nations. Al-Assad succeeded his father in 2000 and won a second term in 2007, unopposed.","Attacks come day after barrel bombs killed 25 children in Aleppo, according to opposition .

"(CNN) -- A former chemist in a Florida crime lab was arrested Tuesday on charges of selling stolen drug evidence that had been switched with over-the-counter medicine, authorities said. Joseph Graves is accused of grand theft, 12 counts of tampering with evidence and nine counts of drug trafficking, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said in a written statement. Authorities say he replaced prescription drugs held as evidence with medicine that could be bought without a prescription. ""The actions of Joseph Graves are disgraceful,"" Florida Department of Law Enforcement commissioner Gerald Bailey said. Officials have said the disclosure could affect some drug convictions in dozens of Florida counties. Graves was arrested at the Escambia County Jail and a judge set bail at $290,000. Additional charges are possible, the news release said. Gretl Plessinger, chief spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, told CNN on Saturday that the chemist worked 2,600 cases for 80 law enforcement agencies in 35 Florida counties and 12 judicial circuits over the past eight years. Plessinger pointed out that it was 1% of the volume of evidence handled by the lab. The investigation began last week when investigators discovered missing prescription pain pills from the evidence room at the Escambia County sheriff's office, authorities said. The missing prescription drugs had been replaced with over-the-counter medications. On Thursday, investigators determined that each case with missing prescription drugs had been analyzed by Graves, and authorities opened a criminal investigation. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said her office would assist in the investigation. ""Our battle against prescription drug abuse in Florida has been very successful over the last three years, and I will not tolerate any actions that compromise our continued success in ridding our state of this problem,"" Bondi said in a statement.","Joseph Graves worked at a crime lab that processed evidence in cases .

"(CNN) -- The annual festival of conspiracy theorizing, belligerent fist-shaking and anxious masculinity known as the National Rifle Association convention came to Houston over the weekend, and it was everything the organizers hoped it would be. Tens of thousands of attendees perused 500 booths where you could look at guns, buy guns, learn about guns, talk about guns and maybe weep about guns, along with plenty of training courses to prepare you for the day when society breaks down and you finally get the chance to use that arsenal to defend your home against marauding gangs of cannibals. NRA has record conference turnout, new president . One favorite was the trainer who advised people to keep a gun locked up in their kids' room. Because what could possibly go wrong? Oh yeah -- accidents. They could shoot each other, such as the 5-year-old who recently shot his 2-year-old sister, or the 13-year-old who shot his 6-year-old sister. This being an NRA gathering, there were media figures and politicians aplenty. Glenn Beck, fresh off suggesting that a man who shot himself last week at Houston airport's was a part of a Reichstag fire-like conspiracy to pave the way for a fascist crackdown on Americans, gave the keynote address. Prominent politicians who appeared included Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former presidential candidate Rick Santorum, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sarah Palin. They have something in common, beyond the fact that they've all run for president before or might in 2016. Like the NRA itself, they all camp out on the conservative fringe but are nevertheless convinced that they represent the mainstream. Perry, who calls Social Security ""a monstrous lie"" and has flirted in the past with the idea that Texas should secede from the United States, thought that what Americans wanted in a president was Yosemite Sam without the intellectual pretensions. Turned out, not so much. Jindal recently suffered a political setback when he proposed cutting the (progressive) income tax and raising the (regressive) sales tax, I guess because poor people in Louisiana have just been having it too easy. Even his conservative state recoiled, and Jindal's approval ratings plummeted. Cruz has cut a McCarthyite swath through Washington in his four months there, leading to rare agreement between Republicans and Democrats that he's an enormous jerk. Naturally, he's seriously considering a run for president in 2016. And as for the former half-term governor of Alaska? Well, you already know about her. All of them believe they represent the real America, and if the country just had a chance to hear their unvarnished views, they could win the White House with ease. That most real Americans find that idea either laughable or terrifying doesn't seem to register with them. They're right at home with the NRA, which just selected as its president a man who still refers to the Civil War as ""the war of Northern aggression,"" and has such a twisted view of liberty that he believes the freedom to buy an AR-15 at a gun show without having to fill out a form is as important as freedom of speech or religion. Eighteen years ago, after a right-wing anti-government extremist bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 men, women and children, NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre railed against the threat from ""jackbooted government thugs"" in ""Nazi bucket helmets."" In response, former President George H.W. Bush wrote the group an outraged letter defending those who work for the government, including one Secret Service agent killed in Oklahoma City who had worked on Bush's detail in the White House. ""He was no Nazi,"" Bush wrote, and resigned his NRA life membership in disgust. In the time since, the NRA has become even more extreme, even more paranoid, even more ensconced in its self-reinforcing world in which guns are all that matter. There may be a few Republicans who now have the courage to stand up to them. But there are still plenty such as Perry, Cruz and Palin, who will troop to their convention and jump into their festering pool of anger and fear. They don't seem to realize how it makes them smell. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.","Prominent conservatives gathered to support the NRA at its convention in Houston .

"Sinai, Egypt (CNN) -- Ten Yemeni militants infiltrated Egyptian soil two months ago and trained local Jihadi cells in the Sinai peninsula, a security official said Friday. ""Several foreign men were spotted shopping in the market by residents and we received intelligence that they were in communication with Jihadist cells in Al Mukataa, a remote area south of Sheikh Zuweid in Northern Sinai,"" said a senior security official associated with Egypt's North Sinai's border guards, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""We hope to capture them in our ongoing raids. They could be hiding in Jabal-Al Halal -- a rugged mountain terrain in central Sinai."" The Yemeni militants were smuggled into Sinai from Sudan among groups of African migrants who have been sold to Bedouin who traffic refugees into Israel for cash, said Ibrahim Al Menei, a Bedouin leader from the Swarkeh tribe who has spearheaded a committee of hundreds of men to curb the illegal trafficking of Africans through the Sinai. ""Word spread among the community that these Yemeni militants were training Jihadi cells in Sheikh Zuweid. The intelligence officers were aware of their presence,"" Menei told CNN. Salem Aneizan, another Bedouin leader, said he had also heard the militants were training Jihadis in the North. ""I hope they are not al Qaeda. Yemen is their hub,"" said Aneizan, who has been assisting the police in securing remote areas in the Sinai since an outbreak of kidnappings and attacks on security checkpoints in recent months. Last week, the Egyptian military launched ""Operation Eagle"" -- a massive offensive using Apache gunships and M-60 tanks against suspected militant Jihadi cells holed up in Sinai since unidentified masked gunmen killed 16 soldiers on August 8 in the border city of Rafah in North-Sinai. Israeli and Egyptian authorities coordinated to allow the helicopter gunships and heavy machinery into the demilitarized zone in accord with the Camp David agreement signed in 1979. No group has come forward to claim responsibility for the attack that has gripped the nation and the international media. Six Egyptian suspects were arrested last week in Sheikh Zuweid but three were later released after questioning, according to Gen. Ahmed Bakr, head of North-Sinai security. Sinai had fallen into a state of lawlessness since the uprising that toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last year. Both Israel and the United States have voiced their concern about the rise of terrorist cells in the Sinai. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned during a visit to Egypt last month that the desert border between Israel and Egypt could become an ""operational base"" for jihadists if security is not maintained. Israel has raised concerns about the region in the wake of the fall of the Mubarak government. In an interview with CNN, Clinton said the problem was discussed at length during her meetings in Egypt and Israel. There is ""the potential of jihadists and terrorists taking up an operational base in Sinai,"" Clinton said in the interview. ""We think this is a dangerous situation for both Egypt and Israel. It is also dangerous for Americans. We have Americans who are part of the multinational force that observes the continuation of the monitoring (of the) Camp David Accord. We have Americans in the Sinai. We've had a few concerns about their safety.""","Official: 10 Yemeni militants came to Egypt two months before Rafah attack .

"Washington (CNN) -- After Washington Mayor Vince Gray voted Tuesday morning and a vocal contingent of volunteers moved on to another precinct, Gray's campaign manager headed downtown to write three news releases to issue based on the outcome of Tuesday's Democratic primary election. Chuck Thies started with the hopeful news first and wrote the release his campaign would blast out if the mayor won the contest with a wide margin. But as voters across the district went to the polls Tuesday morning, even Gray's closest confidants and advisers acknowledged that outcome was not likely. Many cautioned that the election would be close, possibly within a few thousand votes. Thies then wrote two other news releases: one for if the race was too close to call but Gray was winning, and one for if it was too close to call and Muriel Bowser, the upstart councilwoman who was Gray's most obvious challenger, was leading. Thies didn't write the news release for a loss. Why? ""I am superstitious,"" he said. As results slowly streamed in Tuesday night, it became apparent that the ""we lost"" statement would be the one the Gray campaign would be forced to send. Shortly after midnight Wednesday morning, Gray conceded defeat to Bowser in the district's Democratic primary. At that point, 127 out of 143 precincts had reported and Bowser was running at 44% of the vote, compared with Gray's 33%. And shortly after Gray conceded, Bowser accepted her party's nomination in front of a raucous crowd. For Gray, no moment knocked the wheels off his campaign more than what many campaign insiders began calling ""Machen Monday"" -- the day that U.S. Attorney Ron Machen went to court and linked Gray to a 2010 shadow campaign run by businessman Jeffrey Thompson. Prosecutors publicly claimed in March that Gray was aware of the illegal fundraising and had agreed with Thompson to cover it up. Even though Gray had not been charged and has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, the news elevated questions about honesty and ethics that had plagued Gray since his 2010 campaign and left many voters with doubt. D.C. mayor says he won't resign over scandal . March was full of bad news for Gray. The Washington Post endorsed Bowser that month, while polls showed the race tightening. The Thompson news, which the U.S. attorney has been inching toward for years, sent shock waves through the Democratic primary. Gray's opponents seized on the Thompson plea deal, and the ethical questions propelled Bowser into a neck-and-neck race with the incumbent mayor down the stretch. The Thompson plea deal ""sucked a lot of the oxygen out of us,"" close Gray campaign aide Stephen Glaude said after the primary loss. Some volunteers left Gray's campaign after the news, according to Glaude, and some usually deep-pocketed supporters tightened up and stopped giving. ""Clearly the Thompson plea and the manner in which it was reported was a shot to the gut,"" he concluded. And then the public polls hit. While Gray was the frontrunner in early polls, a Washington Post poll shortly after the Thompson news showed a surging Bowser with 30% of Democratic support. Gray remained stagnant at 27%, according to the poll. It was more than just external polling that had Gray's team a bit nervous. Their internal polling also showed the same thing. Poll: D.C. mayor leads, helped by crowded field, in re-election bid . According to Thies, the Gray campaign's initial polling showed the mayor with 28% support and Bowser with 19%. Shortly before ""Machen Monday,"" another internal poll showed that Gray's support had grown slightly to 34% but that Bowser's had grown more and was sitting at 28%. But then news broke of Thompson's plea deal and, according to Thies, the campaign ""bled off everything that we had gained and we went back to our base."" While Thies contends that Gray has a solid base of support in the district of around 28% to 30% of Democratic voters, he admitted that an internal poll after the announcement showed the race in a dead heat. ""The good news is that stuff is coming back to us,"" he said Tuesday morning, based on voter contacts and knocking on doors. And that outward positivity might have been why Gray was so publicly confident Monday night and Tuesday morning. At a stop to rally the troops at campaign headquarters, the mayor munched on a burger, some fries and drank a soft drink. He talked with campaign supporters, slapped a few backs and thanked everyone for their work. In the morning -- admittedly not Gray's favorite time of day -- he talked about the campaign's late momentum and the good feel he had about Tuesday's primary. He acknowledged that ""Machen Monday"" set him back but said he thought the race should not be close. ""Given the record that we have, there should be no question about re-election for us,"" Gray said with a bit of bravado. ""This city is going in the right direction, and I am excited that people see that."" Vincent Gray is the latest D.C. mayor to be dogged by scandal . But by Tuesday night, as polls closed across the district and results began to stream in, it appeared that Gray's confidence couldn't overcome the numbers. By 11 p.m., Bowser had a sufficient lead on the mayor, and at Gray's campaign party at a local hotel ballroom, volunteers started to feel slightly concerned. ""I can't do this,"" said Bernita Carmichael, a vocal volunteer who chanted for Gray for most of Tuesday. While she didn't say she was worried, Carmichael said she got a negative sense from the room. Her senses were correct, because by that time, Gray and his closest advisers in a back room had begun to have doubts. As a cadre of close advisers watched results stream in, Glaude said the mood was souring. By the time 20% of the precincts were reporting and Bowser's lead was not shrinking, Gray's political guru said it was apparent that the campaign ""wasn't doing as well"" as it needed. ""We were hopeful, but when it jumped up to 20 and people were staying where they were, we kind of knew,"" Glaude said.","Incumbent Mayor Vince Gray at one time held a healthy lead in his re-election bid .
A businessman's plea bargain agreement over Gray's 2010 campaign raised doubts .
Challenger Muriel Bowser's poll numbers surged while Gray's remained flat .
Bowser ended up with a double-digit win over the one-term mayor ."
"(CNN) -- When members of the U.S. women's hockey team received their silver medals this week, they looked as if millstones were being slung around their necks. Improbably tied by the Canadians in the final minute of the medal game, then destroyed by a sudden death goal in overtime, they were understandably upset. Ditto for the men as Canada's puck handlers hounded them all over the ice, and left the U.S. players gasping as their hopes for hockey gold skated away, defeated 1-0. Through the long history of the Olympics, no country has won more medals than the United States. Not even close. So one might think, amid all that bounty, the U.S. would take a loss or two in stride. But in many ways, as a culture, Americans often act as if second place -- or third -- is somehow like being tagged with a scarlet letter ""L"" for loser. I like winning as much as the next soul, but treating anything except ultimate victory as passÃÂ© or a cause for shame is a mistake. First, every competitor from every nation at the Olympics has already joined extraordinarily elite company. There are about 2,850 athletes at the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. Compared with the world's population of more than 7 billion, that makes each not a 1-in-a-million personality, but roughly 1-in-2.5-million. Yes, some are certainly great athletes. And while the rest may come across as adequate amateurs, they are almost all rare, elite individuals with astonishing skills -- even when they finish near the bottom of the rankings. Breaking through? Nearly impossible. True, 294 medals will be awarded before the Games are done, but with so many nations competing, that means for each medal winner more than nine other athletes will go home with nothing but photos and memories. The second reason we should cheer louder and longer than we do for those who finish out of the medals? Because their efforts are often no less heroic, and no less demanding than those who triumph. They may finish in the back because they struggled with injury, against personal adversity, or amid the tiny genetic imperfections that can make the difference between a champion and a contender. In the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, my friend American marathoner Meb Keflezighi wanted to win. He had taken the silver medal in Athens in 2004, becoming the first American in more than 30 years to make it to the marathon podium, and he was intent on repeating. Through the winding streets, and over the torturous cobblestones, he ran to win so hard that he had to crawl around his hotel room the next day, unable to even stand on his battered feet. He was taken to his airplane in a wheelchair. He finished fourth, yet every runner who watched will attest that Meb's race was brave and brilliant. Which brings us to the third reason for everyone to feel better about all who compete: This is where greatness comes from. As much as athletes appear to spring fully formed upon the planet during events like the Olympics, almost without exception they have toiled in anonymity for years. While the rest of us have slept in, they have risen before dawn to face the darkness and cold, bending their muscles and bones to compete. While the rest of us have commuted home to complain about our jobs, they have rushed from work to train again far into the night. And for all that, even the best have lost over and over and over again. Losing is what teaches you how to get better. Losing shows you what you're doing wrong. Losing is where winning begins. Maybe I have a natural affinity for the ""also ran"" crowd. I used to win races when I was a kid, but now even though I train thousands of miles, and run marathons and 50 mile ultra-races, age makes it unlikely I'll ever win anything again. But in the middle of the pack I still feel the great struggle of all of those around me; I see people wrestling with the conflicts of their lives, the pain of effort, the clock, and the relentless miles. This is the greatness of sport. And I see it in all the Olympians. A medal around your neck is a spectacular thing, and those who win one ought to be lauded as the best. But we should all run to catch up to the ""also rans"" too, if only for a moment to pat them on the back. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Foreman.","Tom Foreman offers three reasons we should cheer louder and longer than we do for losers .
At the Olympic level, says Foreman, just making it there should be admired .

"New York (CNN) -- A day before investigators expected to gain full access to the site of a deadly explosion that leveled two New York buildings, firefighters digging through the rubble found an intact Bible belonging to the evangelical church that once stood there. Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano told reporters that by Sunday, investigators expected to reach the piping and gas meters in the basement at the scene of Wednesday's blast in East Harlem that killed eight people and injured dozens others. Natural gas might have triggered the explosion that shook the vibrant neighborhood, federal officials said. The National Transportation Safety Board could start pressure-testing gas pipes in the area on Sunday, Cassano said. On the third day of a grueling recovery effort from the three-story pile of rubble, firefighters early Saturday pulled a large waterlogged Bible from the ashes and ruins of the Spanish Christian Church, which occupied the basement and first floor of one of the two destroyed buildings. Explosions expose nation's aging and dangerous gas mains . ""One of our members found a Bible, the original book they tell me of the founders of the church,"" Cassano said. ""It was singed, but it meant an awful lot to the pastor because at least we have a remnant of the church. It showed the pastor they'll be rebuilding. This church is resilient."" When firefighters presented the Spanish-language Bible to the church's 83-year-old pastor, the Rev. Thomas Perez, the pastor was overcome. Perez, who has stood vigil with others at the blast site, was participating in a small prayer gathering with religious leaders and experienced chest pains, said the Rev. Vernon Williams, who attended the vigil. Cassano said Perez was recovering at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan's Upper East Side. ""He was overwhelmed with emotion, for sure,"" the fire commissioner said. ""It's a very sacred thing for him."" After Perez was taken away by ambulance, Williams said, about two dozen people at the vigil prayed for him before carrying the Bible in a procession near the site. ""It was the altar Bible,"" Williams said. ""There was no singing on the Bible at all. It was intact, with a little water damage."" The small evangelical church and Bethel Gospel Assembly lost five members in the explosion. The blast victims were identified as Carmen Tanco, 67; Alexis (Jordy) Salas, 22; Griselde Camacho, 44; Rosaura Hernandez, 21; Andreas Panagopoulos, 43; George Ameado, 44; and Rosaura Barrios, 44. Though it is still possible other victims could be found, police said Saturday that only one known victim has not been publicly named. ""We've recovered all the people that were reported missing, but we're still looking through the debris and a couple of areas in the back in case somebody was there, Cassano said. The ordinary rhythms of the vibrant East Harlem neighborhood of corner bodegas, botanicas, churches, shops and redbrick tenements were shattered with the Wednesday morning blast. Said Cassano, ""We're doing our best to get through as much of the debris as we can as quickly as possible and try to bring some normalcy back to the neighborhood.""

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova drove away a top of the range Porsche sports car for the third straight year in Stuttgart after battling back to beat Ana Ivanovic in the final Sunday. Sharapova may need to build a bigger garage at home to house the prize gifts from the sponsor of the WTA Premier Tier event, but it's a nice problem to have for the four-time grand slam champion, who is returning to her best form after recovering from a recurrent shoulder injury. ""I had quite a slow beginning to the year, but me and my team have been working hard to get in the position to win titles again, and I'm so happy to be able to do it in Stuttgart,"" the Russian told the official WTA website. But in a battle of former world number one's, Sharapova was taken all the way by Ivanovic, who led by a set and 3-1 and looked set to take the keys of the Porsche herself. But Sharapova reeled off 11 of the last 13 games of the match on the red clay to win 3-6 6-4 6-1 in two hours three minutes. It was the 30th career title for the two-time defending champion and an important boost ahead of the French Open in Paris next month. ""For the first half of the match I thought it might not be my day today, but somehow I turned it around,"" she added. Serbia's Ivanovic had underlined her improvement with a fine run to the title match, but was left to rue missed opportunities to close out the match in the second set. ""In the second set she definitely went for those big shots and she made some amazing points. She's just a great player, and that's what happens when you play against great players in big matches like this. You need to use your opportunities,"" she said. Sharapova, who is a brand ambassador for the sponsor, took match point with her 34th winner and was clearly delighted to continue her dominance at the German event. ""It's been an incredible few years at this tournament,"" she said. On the ATP Tour, Japan's Kei Nishikori wrapped up the Barcelona Open with a 6-2 6-2 win over Santiago Giraldo of Colombia in the final. Nishikori was always on top as he won his second title of the year and fifth of his burgeoning career. He hit 19 winners to leave Giraldo with few opportunities to show his best in a one-sided match. The tournament was notable for the shock defeat of world number one Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals to Nicolas Almagro, who was in turn beaten by Giraldo in the last four.

"(CNN) -- He is in that landing pattern that middle-aged heartthrobs finally come to: time for home and family and a woman who is worthy of keeping his love. The 50-plus Oscar winner, producer and political activist George Clooney is apparently engaged to be married. He's at a particularly pivotal age. Forget about the 50s being the new 40s -- the 50s are really very specific. Even the most youthful people will start thinking about the meaning of life as the years no longer stretch out in a fantasy of infinity. Those years between 50 and 60 do seem to be a particularly poignant age for men, especially the kind of man who has trouble giving up motorcycles. Sometime in this period, the thrill seekers and lust lovers get their whiff of mortality (perhaps because of their latest motorcycle accident) and they turn to love with a new sense of its gravitas. With a nod to the motivation most of us mortals have, they are ready for an emotional legacy. (Hint: watch for children) It might irk Clooney to be seen as so predictable. He's a gifted, idiosyncratic, goes-his-own-way, irreverent kind of guy. But he has been practicing for this life transition in full view. In his films, he has played lost middle-aged men, lost in their careers, lost in neglected marriages, lost because of a lack of connection to something important -- ""Up in the Air,"" ""The Descendents,"" ""Michael Clayton,"" among others. Many of these men reshuffle their lives, readjust their principles or at least find some self knowledge they sorely lacked. What we know about Amal Alamuddin . If the reports of his engagement are true, this is kind of what Clooney has done, and what a lot of professionally single men ultimately come to do, especially about love. His apparent fiancee, Amal Alamuddin, is an accomplished and wordly lawyer. Clooney's doing that middle-aged love choice. He's picking a woman of substance as well as beauty -- the kind of woman you would want as friend and counselor, the kind of woman who would have the genes to be the mother of your children -- and it's now, because it suddenly dawns on you that you have no time to lose. In this scenario of the chastened older Lothario, the candidate is young enough to lust after and smart enough for impregnation. It's not that women, especially stars, don't come to the same point as Clooney and end up in the same position. But biology forces them to make the comparable choice at least a decade or so earlier. Unlike a woman his age, Clooney can do the whole settling-down gambit at almost any age. But he probably understood some ages are better for this than others. I know this isn't very romantic, but the timing is -- whether the 50-something group knows it or not -- guided by the Grim Reaper. If that sounds bad, it's not. Middle age is an important time for reassessment and course correction. No matter how bright your star, you know that only so much time is left to have a profound relationship and, perhaps, a family. This is the real anchor of middle-aged love: It's time to stop fooling around.","Pepper Schwartz: George Clooney is allegedly engaged in his 50s, a pivotal age .

"(CNN) -- I am extremely proud of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. He made the exact right move in banning Donald Sterling from the NBA for life and fining him $2.5 million for his offensive, racist comments. It sets a definitive tone not only for how we deal with racism in the NBA but also how we should be dealing with it in the country as a whole. I am not a politician. I am not a legislator. I'm not an activist. I do have fame. I do have accolades. I played professional basketball. But all of this aside, I am a man, a black man. I grew up in the inner-city street projects of Baltimore, moving to North Carolina when I was 16. My passion and love for a round orange ball has taken me to unimaginable heights, earning me a measure of success in the NBA. I have lived the majority of my life in the bright and narrow cast of a spotlight, so I know what it is like to live with the obligation to shape words into politically correct statements, and to mute my thoughts in moments of emotion. At times it is my job to do so. Hearing about, and then listening to, the Donald Sterling recordings early Saturday left me and my NBA family disgusted. As one of the premiere professional leagues in the world, we take pride in carrying the banner as one of the most diverse sports industries, with a commitment to fair racial hiring practices. More than 80% of our players are men of color, and well over a third of them are African-American. Again, I'm no activist. I have turned down more press requests and interviews surrounding the abhorrent comments of Sterling in the past two days than I care to number. And just when I thought I would refocus my energy on the most evenly matched NBA playoffs in my recollection, CNN offered me the opportunity to depress my mute button and comment on what has become a much bigger story than one man's racist comments. Racism is a real problem that has survived through generations and generations in this country. It is time to use the opportunity to further the race discussion. Let me be clear. In my career as a basketball player and now as an executive with the Atlanta Hawks organization, I have never been subjected to racism in my workplace. But there is racism, sexism, bigotry everywhere in our society. As a black man growing up in the South, I have, of course, experienced it. There are many stories surrounding the Sterling recordings; the motivation, who was involved, and so on. But the focus needs to turn to whether or not we will allow a multibillion dollar league and a country of multicultural influences to be consumed by the news cycle noise. The conversation must continue on a broader scale. This is bigger than basketball. Will this moment fade into the background? Or will we as leaders of industry and community meet the need for continued discussion about the prevalence of racism in our country? We live in a society where public perception dictates reality. So we carefully craft and weave sound bites and statements, giving the public enough until it moves into the next news cycle. The noise consumes 24 hours. Distracted, preoccupied, the public moves on to the next story. Can the gap be closed? I for one am clearly choosing to accept the responsibility yet again to craft and weave my words in the spotlight in this case to open up and invite the continued conversation on racism. As professional athletes we live a privileged life. We're blessed to make a living in line with the market, and the market generates billions of dollars only thanks to the fans that pay to watch our sports and buy our brands. But we are employees at the end of the day. We expect a safe and fair environment to do what we are paid to do. We expect to advance in executive positions where qualifications dictate and where we have been given the opportunity to shine -- not because of our race or gender, but because of our abilities. We pour our passion into our jobs, and we accept our paychecks gladly. Just like any other work space, we will always run across people who will be jealous of the individual success of another or the flip side of that, find ourselves boxed in because of the direct selfish intentions of the powers in positions above you. In the competitive business of professional sports, there will always be those in positions of ultimate power whose job it is to dictate your very future based on a laundry list of reasons. As an executive with a level of significant impact and inherent power, you are expected to carry yourself with dignity, respect, integrity and thoughtfulness. A leader should exhibit these qualities at all times. I have been extremely fortunate to play for and work for some of the greatest owners the NBA has ever had, and I continue to value those relationships because of the qualities they showed not just in business, but more important, in life. I feel deep disdain that this discussion of race was generated out of the highest level of the very sport that has given me so much happiness, confidence and success. It is with my obligation as a representative of the NBA to uphold the values we live and lead by as well as share my experiences with the next generation to make our sport and community better. It is my deep desire to impress upon current and future players that NBA leadership will continue to strip away the layers of underlying and seemingly unchecked racism. As for Sterling's comments, they really mean nothing in the big picture. In the end, he will be one man, one ignorantly misguided outlier who galvanized and brought even closer the tightknit community of the NBA. He will be consumed by the noise of yet another news cycle and forgotten. It is incumbent upon us as executive leaders and community leaders to continue to be outspoken to ensure the lessons of this moment do not become part of that same noisy news cycle. The conversation is way bigger than any one man.","NBA Hall of Famer, Hawks exec Dominique Wilkins happy Sterling banned for life .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- At 678, California has the nation's largest death row population, yet the state has not executed anyone in four years. A poll of 500 police chiefs found the death penalty ranked last among their priorities for reducing violent crime. But it spends more than $130 million a year on its capital punishment system -- housing and prosecuting inmates and coping with an appellate system that has kept some convicted killers waiting for an execution date since the late 1970s. This is according to a new report that concludes that states are wasting millions on an inefficient death penalty system, diverting scarce funds from other anti-crime and law enforcement programs. ""Thirty-five states still retain the death penalty, but fewer and fewer executions are taking place every year,"" said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. ""But the overall death row population has remained relatively steady. At a time of budget shortfalls nationwide, the death penalty is turning into an expensive form of life without parole."" His group commissioned the study released Tuesday. A privately conducted poll of 500 police chiefs released with the report found the death penalty ranked last among their priorities for reducing violent crime. Only 1 percent found it to the best way to achieve that goal. Adding police officers ranked first. The death row population in 2007, the most-recent statistic available from the Justice Department, was 3,220. It was at 2,250 two decades ago, but the numbers have not grown significantly since 2000. Forty executions have occurred so far in 2009 in 10 states, all by lethal injection. That total is up from 37 for all of last year, but less than half of the high of 98, from 10 years ago. The Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976. Ohio recently suspended lethal injections after corrections officials were forced to cancel the execution of Romell Broom last month, when a suitable vein could not be found after two hours of trying. Virginia plans a Nov. 10 execution for John Allen Muhammad, the so-called Beltway Sniper, convicted of randomly killing 10 people in 2002 with a high-powered rifle. The Death Penalty Information Center study found that death penalty costs can average $10 million more per year per state than life sentences. Increased costs include higher security needs and guaranteed access to an often lengthy pardon and appellate process. The group is an information resource on capital punishment, and opposes its application as unworkable, inefficient and prone to mistakes. Florida, where two men have been put to death this year, spends an average of $24 million per execution. That average has remained consistent since 2005, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Many death penalty proponents say part of the problem is that states have added unnecessary, time-consuming delays, and have been reluctant to carry out the death penalty that their own legislatures have enacted. They say states should carry out the wishes of judges and juries that weighed evidence and imposed death on the worst murderers. Death penalty supporters acknowledge that states outside the South have been reluctant to impose the punishment, even in the face of rising big-city crime rates. ""I think we need to build support for the death penalty and need to impose it more regularly where it is warranted,"" Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Sacramento, California-based Criminal Justice Legal Foundation told CNN earlier this year. Having the death penalty can offer powerful incentives in plea bargaining, Scheidegger said, and could provide states with large savings in trial and incarceration costs. His group conducted a study earlier this year comparing murder cases resolved by guilty plea with those that went to trial. In states with the death penalty, the average county obtained sentences of at least 20 years in almost 51 percent of cases in which the defendant was charged with murder and convicted of murder or voluntary manslaughter. Those sentences were reached through a guilty plea in about 19 percent of the cases. In states without the death penalty, sentences of at least 20 years were obtained in 40 percent of those cases, but only 5 percent were guilty pleas, about one-quarter of the number in the death penalty states. That study relied on U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics data from 33 large urban counties. One example cited by Scheidegger of the plea bargaining effect involved Shaun Earl Arender. He confessed this year to the sexual assault and murder of 6-year-old Hanna Mack in Texas, and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in return for avoiding the death penalty. Texas consistently leads the nation with the most executions. Eleven state legislatures have considered repealing the death penalty this year. New Mexico has banned it, and Maryland has narrowed the criteria under which it can be used. Kansas, New Hampshire and the U.S. military are the only jurisdictions that have death penalty laws but have not conducted any executions since 1976. Lethal injection is used in the vast majority of executions, but electrocution, the gas chamber, hanging and firing squad remain as alternative methods.","Study: Death penalty costs can average $10M more per year per state than life terms .

"(CNN) -- With a top Air Force officer facing allegations of sexual battery and the Pentagon releasing a troubling report on the number of sex crimes in the military, President Barack Obama said Tuesday that he has ""no tolerance"" for sexual assault in the armed services. Obama's remarks at the White House were in response to new Pentagon statistics showing an increase in reports of sex assaults, as well as allegations of sexual battery against an Air Force officer who led a sex assault prevention unit. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, 41, was arrested early Sunday in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, accused of grabbing a woman's breasts and buttocks, Arlington County police said. According to the police log posted on the Arlington County web site, the woman fought off a ""drunken"" assailant in a parking lot about 12:35 a.m. when he tried to grab her again before she called authorities. The woman did not know her attacker, Arlington County police spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said. Krusinski has been removed from his duty pending the outcome of an investigation, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said at a briefing with reporters. Krusinski initially was held on $5,000 bond. He will be arraigned Thursday. Sheryl Shane, an attorney for Krusinski, told CNN she had no comment on the case. A call to the officer was not immediately returned. Arlington County Commonwealth's Attorney Theo Stamos told CNN that the Air Force had contacted her and requested that the county transfer the case to the military for prosecution. She said she told the Air Force that the county has routinely prosecuted service members and will hold onto the case. ""It never occurred to me to turn over the case to the military."" Stamos said. In February Krusinski was placed in charge of a branch of the Air Force's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program, and he oversaw a five-person office, an Air Force official said Monday. The official declined to be named, citing an ongoing law enforcement matter. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh and Air Force Secretary Michael Donley were ""appalled"" by the allegations against Krusinski, they told members of Congress at a Senate Armed Service Committee hearing. Welsh said asking for jurisdiction in a case involving a service member and a civilian was ""standard practice in cases like these."" Hagel has expressed disgust over the allegations. ""We're particularly disappointed because this alleged incident occurred here at the headquarters, the heart and the -- and the main leadership of our institution,"" he said. ""And our men and women around the world who give of themselves and their families certainly must expect more and deserve more. So we all have to take some responsibility."" The Defense Department released figures on Tuesday that indicated that the number of military members who experienced a sexual assault increased from 19,300 in 2010 to 26,000 in 2012. The figure was extrapolated from a 24% response rate to 108,000 surveys. Obama said he wants to see victims feel comfortable reporting when they have been victimized. ""For those who are in uniform who've experienced sexual assault, I want them to hear directly from their commander in chief that I've got their backs,"" he said. ""I will support them, and we're not gonna tolerate this stuff. And there will be accountability. If people have engaged in this behavior, they should be prosecuted."" CNN's Ashley Fantz and Shirley Henry contributed to this report.","NEW: Officer will be arraigned Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Ukrainian protesters vacated the capital's city hall Sunday in exchange for the government dropping charges against arrested demonstrators, an official said. Protesters vacated city hall, unblocked a major street and left other government buildings as part of an amnesty deal calling for the opposition to vacate government buildings in Kiev, opposition parliament member Arsen Avakov said. They had occupied the city hall for nearly three months. Protesters will remain outside city hall and will not allow police inside, he said. The opposition plans to hold a rally Sunday morning. Ukraine is mired in a political crisis that has led to the Prime Minister's resignation. Thousands of demonstrators have packed Kiev's Independence Square since November, when President Viktor Yanukovych reversed a decision to sign a trade deal with the European Union and instead turned toward Russia. Violent confrontations flared after a sweeping anti-protest law was signed weeks ago, and an uneasy standoff remains on the streets. Despite concessions such as the deal, Ukraine's opposition parties continue to call for constitutional reforms to shift power away from the president. Ukraine, a country of 45 million people, is split between pro-European regions in the West and a more Russia-oriented East. Its leader and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on a $15 billion deal for Russia to buy Ukrainian debt and slash the price of natural gas. Yanukovych has resisted calls for him to step down and defended the government's handling of the political crisis.","In exchange, the government will drop charges against arrested protesters .

"(CNN) -- What is the internet for? Some think of it as the marketing opportunity of a lifetime. Others, a shining repository for boundless information. And some, like the folks at ""Avenue Q,"" assert that it's for porn. Well, from where we sit, the question, as applied to the majority of its denizens, is pretty easily answered: rampant life-casting. Interneteur Josh Harris saw it coming back in the '90s with his Orwellian art project/society Quiet, in which a bunch of isolated volunteers had their lives monitored by scads of webcams. Andy Warhol forecast this even earlier when he quipped, ""In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes."" For better or worse, the Web has allowed everyone to be the shining star in their very own drama/comedy. (Here's hopin' yours wouldn't run on Lifetime.) So this week, instead of telling you to cease and desist tweeting about your cat's health problems, we're going to provide you with a cadre of tools you can utilize to stroke the old ego -- to tap into the pulsing vein of your rapt audience and reap the benefits of their attention. NB: Use these tools wisely, given the nature of your online community. If your friends/followers are terrible people who hide behind the anonymity of the Web in order to cut people down for sport ... err ... you might just wanna skip these services and call your mom. She's sure to tell you you're special. Unless you're estranged or something. In which case, maybe Lifetime producers would take the call after all? Find out how interesting you are . Everyone has fascinating hidden talents, talents that might not always come up in casual conversation: . Tom: ""So, it's pretty hot out today, huh?"" Bob: ""Yeah, hot. Say, did I ever tell you that a childhood obsession with the Greek god Hephaestus lead to me to take up metallurgy at the age of 13? That was awesome, because then I got to work as the blacksmith at Colonial Williamsburg for a few summers."" Tom: ""O ... K ..."" That didn't quite flow smoothly, huh? Luckily, developer Kyle Bragger recently dreamed up a little site called Facto that lets users share random facts about themselves, which other users can then comment on and rate. According to Bragger, tools like Facto ""play off our collective interest in being voyeurs, and the perpetual desire to 'see behind the curtain' and know what someone really thinks/feels about you."" Bragger also recently added a feature that lets you share facts about you and a friend. (Might wanna nix the one about how y'all hooked up on NYE while his/her GF/BF was stuck at home on account of the blizzard, though). Luckily for the faint of heart, most of the ratings you can choose from are positive, the most cutting being ""boring."" So, yeah, if you're really sensitive about your passion for rock tumbling or souvenir spoon collecting, you might want to skip this one. See what others really think of you . If you think ""I,"" ""love"" and ""you"" are the sweetest three words in the lexicon, obviously, you have yet to try out Three Words, where friends anonymously describe users in (yep) three words. That's right, there's a service out that where people do nothing but talk about you. Three Words was launched pretty recently by teen entrepreneur Mark Bao, and it's already seeing daily pageviews in the millions. ""The inspiration was mostly about trying to get an honest opinion of yourself from others, through adjectives (or words, in general),"" Bao says. Here's hoping your friends actually do love you. Legitimize your musings . You know how your friends are always asking you about your opinions on the notions put forth in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' ""The Communist Manifesto""? No? Well, we can't do anything about the woefully plebeian nature of your social circle, but we can direct you to Quora, a nifty little social question-and-answer site that lets you create an account, follow other users, post questions that the masses can weigh in on and answer questions yourself. Although Quora launched in 2009, it has blown up of late: Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz even signed up and answered the question, ""What does Dustin Moskovitz think of the Facebook movie?"" Many questions seem to be focused on social media (since Quora is currently replete with early adopters), so if you're not into talking about Angel Investors and the advertising potential of Tumblr, you might wanna stick to picking the brains of your less-techy pals. But if the service continues to take off, you might just get to ask the masses what they think of the correlation between Marx and Engels' tract and the films of George A. Romero after all. Find out whether your tweets are boring . Your Twitter account may be akin to James Joyce's literary masterpiece ""Ulysses"": a rambling, dialectically daring, real-time observation of modern life. Or it may be a soul-killing list of your health issues. Either way, people have opinions, and don't you want to know what those opinions are? Of course you do. A trio of researchers from MIT, the University of Southampton and Georgia Tech have put together a little tool (which they intend to use for research purposes, of course) that allows you to see just how stimulating your tweets are to friends and strangers alike. It's called Who Gives a Tweet? Basically, folks rate your 140-character musings on a scale of completely useless to totally worth reading.

"(CNN)  -- Former world champion Ricky Hatton has had his boxing license revoked after damaging revelations about his personal life. The British Boxing Board of Control took action against the 31-year-old for ""bringing the sport into disrepute."" They ruled his ""current physical condition is such that the Board decided to withdraw his boxer's licence."" Hatton admitted he was suffering from depression and a drink problem after a tabloid newspaper published video footage of the boxer allegedly using cocaine. Hatton, a former world light-welterweight champion, last fought in a May 2009 showdown with Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas, being knocked out in the second round. Hatton, who had massive following for his all-action style, was also beaten in another money-spinning bout in Nevada by Floyd Mayweather Junior. After the revelations in the News of the World, the British board called a hearing on Wednesday and issued their judgment Thursday. Hatton was also fined Â£20,000 pounds ($31,388) and had his manager license revoked, but they will allow him to continue as a promoter. The board said they were allowing Hatton to continue in this role because of the effect on ""innocent persons"" who were employed by his organization, including other professional boxers.","Former world boxing champion Ricky Hatton has his boxing license revoked .

"(CNN) -- Former England cricket captain Michael Atherton has called him ""ruthless,"" but for Lalit Modi, the man behind cricket's revolutionary Indian Premier League and vice-president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), this is less of a criticism and more a statement of fact. Bringing glitz to the game, Lalit Modi is the man behind cricket's Indian revolution. ""I am ruthless, without doubt,"" he told CNN's Talk Asia in Mumbai. ""Otherwise we wouldn't get where we were."" Many believe that Modi, 44, has taken cricket into a new era, turning a sport that can be baffling to watch and take five days to play, into a brightly-colored instant hit of action taking just a few hours. With cheerleaders, the best players in the world and even Bollywood stars as part owners of some of the teams, Modi has concocted a recipe fit for prime-time TV consumption, in a country renown for its passion for the game. Modi's came up with the idea of a new Indian cricket league came 14 years ago, but resisted the involvement of the BBCI at that time, citing too many vested interested within India's main cricketing body that would have spoiled his ideas. While ruthless he is also astute to the financial potential of cricket in India and the IPL. After graduating from Duke University in the U.S. in sports management he returned to India to launch ESPN and 10 Sports. Coming from a family that controls Modi Enterprise, an industrial conglomerate worth $1.5 billion, Modi admits his family were concerned that he was moving away from business and spending so much time with cricket while setting up the IPL. ""They didn't think that I'll be spending so much time with cricket, and cricket has taken up so much time of my time, but the job has made it so demanding. Either I do it well, and if I do it well then I need to give the time for it,"" he told CNN. It's been time well spent, both professionally and personally: Modi has his own private jet, gets mobbed in the streets by fans and can hang out with Bollywood stars. Yet he hasn't made a fortune from the IPL: ""I have an honorary position and BCCI is a charity and a trust. It's a nonprofit-making organization and we do this for development of the game and I'm passionate about the game."" However as vice-president of the BCCI he has been instrumental in boosting its revenues, brokering television deals and sponsorship associations that could see it top the $1 billion mark in the next five years. It's no surprise that such an iconoclastic figure in a game rooted in tradition has his personal critics and those that are skeptical about the direction he is taking the game. Modi was not without controversy himself, as he was accused of drug dealing and abduction while at university, claims that were never proven. The 20-over version of the game played in the IPL has worried some that the finer points of the game may be sacrificed for the instant, mass-market appeal. But for Modi, it's quite simple: ""We've hit records in viewership, record numbers in sponsorships sales, record number in team franchise sales, the owner themselves have done so well, the stadiums are full. We got Bollywood involved, I mean it's a script that I couldn't have written better myself.""","Lalit Modi is the man behind cricket's Indian Premier League .

"(CNN) -- Marie Mills held her 77-year-old father, who had collapsed outside in a Washington street. She screamed for help. A passerby rushed across the street to bang on the door of a fire station, knowing that firefighters are trained to provide emergency medical help. But they wouldn't leave the station. The same thing happened when two more people tried to summon the firefighters for assistance, Mills says. ""We looked across the street at the fire station. There was a firefighter that was actually standing against the fire apparatus,"" she told CNN affiliate WJLA. ""Everybody started trying to wave him over."" But the firefighter said he had to be dispatched first. ""I even ran to the curb and said, 'Are you going to help me or let my dad die?'"" said Mills. Later, after an ambulance finally arrived, Cecil Mills died at a hospital. He had suffered an apparent heart attack. An investigation is under way and, so far, no officials are publicly challenging Mills' version of events. ""It's an outrage,"" Washington Mayor Vincent Gray said at a news conference. ""I was absolutely furious."" He said he apologized to Marie Mills for ""what appeared to be dereliction,"" DC news station WTTG reported. ""Those who failed to respond as they should -- they will be held accountable, period,"" Gray vowed. In comments Thursday to CNN, Gray said he has ""taken a lot of time with it."" The investigation is ""being done as rapidly as we possibly can,"" he added. The D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department told CNN it is investigating the incident, which took place along the 1300 block of Rhode Island Avenue on Saturday. ""Our duty is to respond to all requests for emergency assistance. If it is determined that proper protocols were not followed at the conclusion of our investigation, then appropriate action will be taken,"" spokesman Tim Wilson said. The protocol is in question because, according to the Mills family, those who asked for help at the fire station were told to call 911. Calls to 911 were placed, but a mix-up with the address delayed an ambulance, said Washington Council member Tommy Wells. ""Two things happened,"" he said. ""One was that no one came out of the fire house to help this gentleman. The other is the ambulance that was dispatched was dispatched to the wrong place. This was a number of fiascos."" Paul Quander, deputy mayor for public safety, said a ""very new, probationary employee"" was at the facility. The employee's first response should be ""to ask a senior person, and we believe that was done,"" he said, according to WTTG. ""The question now is what did that senior person say? What did that person do? Did they follow protocols and procedures?"" There are no protocols that would prevent fire personnel from helping those in need, Quander told CNN Thursday. ""These are people who run into burning buildings. They work in the most hazardous conditions imaginable. ""They cross the streets, they cross highways to get to people. It is understood. It is common. This is why it is so troubling that we did not take the appropriate action in this case. It's right across the street."" ""It's hard to get your arms around"" the idea that this took place, he added. Lt. Kellene Davis was the officer in charge of the station at the time of the incident, WTTG reports. Davis did not respond immediately to an e-mail Thursday from CNN, and a call to a phone number listed for her was not answered. Also Thursday, a spokesman said that two employees of the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department have been suspended with pay in the wake of the incident. ""I cannot say who they were because it is a personnel matter and an ongoing investigation, but I can tell you that neither of them was the probationary firefighter involved in the incident,"" said Keith St. Clair, with the office of the deputy mayor for public safety. The employees were working at the station, he said. Cecil Mills, a lifelong Washington resident, worked for the Department of Parks and Recreation. His daughter, in mourning, had kind words for the mayor's handling of the matter. ""I appreciate how seriously he is taking this because it never should have happened,"" she told WTTG. Marie Mills wasn't immediately available Thursday when contacted by CNN. The firefighters' union said the incident simply should never have happened. ""We need to find out why it did occur and make sure it never happens again,"" said Ed Smith, president of the DC Fire Fighters Association, in a statement reported by WTTG. He added that on the union's behalf, ""I offer Mr. Mills' family a sincere apology."" CNN's Aaron Cooper and Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report from Washington.","NEW: Two employees have been suspended with pay, a spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- A former English Premier League footballer is one of six players who have reportedly been arrested in the latest fixing scandal to hit the sport. Second division team Blackburn Rovers confirmed Monday that striker D.J. Campbell had been taken into custody by police as part of an undercover investigation into claims that the players accepted bribes to ensure certain outcomes during a match -- known as spot-fixing -- for betting purposes. ""Following reports in today's national media, Blackburn Rovers can confirm that striker D.J. Campbell has been arrested,"" Blackburn, which has won the English title three times, said in a statement. ""The club will be making no further comment on what is now an ongoing legal matter."" Campbell came to prominence in 2006 when he was signed by EPL side Birmingham, having spent most of his career in non-league football. His time in the top flight was limited as Birmingham was relegated that season, but he helped the club win promotion again before being sold to second division Leicester and then returning to the EPL with Blackpool. CNN has attempted to contact Campbell but is awaiting a response. The arrests were first reported by the UK's Sun on Sunday newspaper, which focused on what appear to be claims by former Nigeria international Sam Sodje, who was recorded on video published by the Sun saying he could arrange for players to receive yellow cards for offenses during a match. On the video published by the Sun, Sodje appears to admit he purposefully got himself thrown out of a game by hitting the opposing team's player, while in action for his former club Portsmouth against Oldham in a third division match in February. Authorities have not confirmed Sodje is one of the players arrested. CNN has attempted to reach Sodje for comment, but hasn't yet reached him. Sodje, who was released by Portsmouth at the end of last season, twice punched an opposition player in the groin before being ordered off the pitch. The Sun on Sunday reported that Sodje claimed on hidden camera that he received ÃÂ£70,000 ($114,000) for doing so. He also appears to claim in the Sun's hidden video footage that he could influence the outcome of EPL matches, and that he was targeting the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. ""That'll be the one, the World Cup,"" Sodje said in the video, according to the Sun on Sunday. ""We'll do a whole game, get booked once, big money. If you pay a hundred grand it will be huge."" Portsmouth, now playing in England's bottom division, said it is ""extremely shocked and saddened "" by the allegations. ""Match-fixing of any type goes to the heart of the integrity of the game,"" said spokesman Colin Farmery. ""The player in question no longer plays for the club and we have not been contacted by the authorities, but of course we would cooperate fully with any inquiry."" Sodje's brother Akpo plays for third division side Tranmere, and his club said it was ""aware"" of the allegations that the 33-year-old and another of his teammates, former Jamaica international Ian Goodison, are also being investigated by the National Crime Agency (NCA). CNN has been unable to reach either of the Tranmere players for comment. Oldham Athletic confirmed it is cooperating with the authorities over allegations involving its player Cristian Montano but -- like Tranmere -- declined to comment further due to the ongoing investigation. Oldham said it has suspended Montano without pay until the investigation is concluded. CNN has reached out to Montano for comment, but hasn't yet connected with him. None of the six players have been charged. Five were released on bail until April 2014, the NCA said Monday, and the other is still being questioned. It said the Sun on Sunday had passed on material from its own investigation. England's Professional Footballers' Association said the allegations, if proven, ""unfortunately demonstrate the real issue football faces in terms of corruption."" ""It highlights the necessity of the work carried out by the PFA and other stakeholders in the game in educating players of these risks,"" the PFA said in a statement Monday. ""We take the issue of integrity very seriously and will continue in our efforts to eradicate this evil from our game."" Football authorities have been trying to clamp down on match-fixing and illegal gambling, much of which is driven by Asian betting syndicates. In February, European crime agency Europol announced it had probed 680 suspicious matches across the globe including two European Champions League matches and in September authorities in Singapore made 14 arrests in an attempt to crackdown on football match fixing. There have been arrests after investigations into competitions across Europe, in China and Australia, with most involving lower-level teams. There were seven arrests in Britain last month as part of the NCA probe into a ""suspected international illegal betting syndicate"" which is targeting lower league matches. This came after four British players were arrested and charged for alleged match-fixing in Australia's Victoria Premier League this year. The quartet, who spent part of last season with clubs in England's non-league Conference South -- effectively the country's sixth division -- have been suspended by football's world governing body FIFA. Two pleaded guilty and were fined last week, while the other two will return to court on December 20. The NCA confirmed it is working with the English Football Association and the Gambling Commission as it continues its investigations.","Blackburn striker D.J.

"London (CNN) -- Reports that a Scottish teenager took his own life after becoming the victim of an alleged Internet blackmail scam have heightened concerns in Britain over online abuse. Daniel Perry, from Dunfermline, was reportedly the victim of blackmailers who recorded his interactions via Skype with a person he believed was an American girl his own age. They then threatened to show his family the footage unless he paid up, UK media reports say. Instead, the 17-year-old jumped from a bridge last month. News of his death comes on the heels of outrage over the suicide of 14-year-old Hannah Smith, from Leicestershire in England. Her family said she took her own life after she was bullied on the social networking website ask.fm, having gone there to seek advice on the skin condition eczema. Her funeral was held Friday at St. Mary's Church in her hometown of Lutterworth. The mourners were asked by Hannah's father to wear brightly colored clothes, not black, the church's vicar, the Rev. Charlie Styles, said in an online statement beforehand. Styles said the informal service would ""provide a focal point for the community in a time of shock and great sadness."" Daniel was also taunted and urged to kill himself by trolls on the Ask.fm website, The Daily Telegraph newspaper said. The Telegraph quoted Daniel's mother, Nicola, on Friday as saying the people behind the video scam he fell prey to are ""clever and dangerous"" and had manipulated the footage. ""He wasn't doing anything wrong, just what anyone his age might do, but this scam is all about exploiting young people,"" she said. Police in Scotland told CNN they are investigating the circumstances of a teenage boy's death. They declined to identify him or give further details. A leading UK children's protection charity, the NSPCC, urged children and young people to find out how to protect themselves online -- and to seek help if they found themselves targeted by bullies or blackmailers. ""It's absolutely heart-rending that a young person could be deceived in such a way, with such a tragic outcome and our thoughts are with this young man's family,"" said Elaine Chalmers, area manager for the NSPCC's helpline in Scotland. ""If you've only seen a static picture of someone online, they may not be who they say they are. It's important not to send people pictures of yourself or take part in video calls if you aren't sure who you are speaking to. ""If you have been deceived online, you need to remember that you aren't to blame and you are not the only person that this has happened to."" Beatbullying, an international bullying prevention charity, has called for a boycott of ask.fm. Some companies pulled their advertising in protest over Hannah's death. Ask.fm said it was ready to work with the police in that case. ""We would like to reassure all users and parents of users that we are committed to ensuring that our site is a safe environment,"" the site said. ""We do not condone bullying of any kind, or any form of unacceptable use of our site.""

"Canton, Ohio (CNN) -- As the snow started falling, I drove to Giant Eagle to pick up some groceries. With a storm on the way, I needed to stock up on supplies in case we got snowed in. I pulled into the parking lot of the store and found a spot right in front of the entrance. I sat there for a few minutes, collecting what I needed to take in. As I reached over to the passenger seat to grab my wallet, I glanced over at the car next to me through the passenger window and saw three people who were loading their groceries into their car. I also saw a large man standing there, reaching over the hood of their car. He was wiping the snow and ice off the car's windshield with his bare hands. The owner of the vehicle looked at him with an icy stare that seemed to say, ""How dare you touch my car."" She seemed disgusted just breathing the same air as the man cleaning her windshield. Instead of asking him to stop or giving him a few dollars, she quickly climbed into her car and gunned the car forward so fast the man was knocked back. A few seconds later, the man got up, walked to my car and knocked on my window. I hadn't even processed what I had just witnessed. Now he was coming over to me and I had no idea what to say. ""Please, not now, I just want to get what I need and get home,"" I thought to myself. Where I live, it's common for people to approach you for money. I took a deep breath and started to open the door. The man opened it the rest of the way, being careful not to hit the car next to me. This man stood well over 6 feet and wore sweatpants, a light flannel shirt and boots that were left untied. It was roughly 20 degrees outside and he was clearly not dressed for the cold. In a rather abrupt voice, he broke the silence by asking, ""Can I have your change?"" I scooped up the change I had in the car and gave him everything I had, which was only $2.37. After handing him the money, I explained that I didn't have any more. ""I'm cold and hungry. Can you take me to the shelter?"" he asked. I noticed his hands. They were at his side but his fingers moved silently up and down, as though he was playing an invisible piano. He spoke with great difficulty -- in a stilted, mechanical fashion and his face showed no emotion. I never felt threatened, although he stood in my personal space about 1 or 2 feet in front of me. He would occasionally look in my direction, but never at me. Although he stood so close, he avoided eye contact. ""Can you drive me to the shelter? Because it's warm there and they have food,"" he asked me again. ""I'm homeless and very hungry,"" he said. ""I'm not lying to you. If I lie to you then you might not help me."" I really didn't know what to say, because I wasn't comfortable driving him anywhere. Then he asked me to buy him some food and gloves. I thought about what to say. I knew he would have a hard time understanding: I don't have any money. My family is struggling to survive each day. I was trying to figure out how to explain to him that I couldn't help, but I was at a loss for words. Then something happened that shook me to the core and completely broke my heart. As I was trying to tell him no, he looked me in the eyes. All of a sudden, I was looking at my oldest son. My wife and I have three boys with autism; the oldest is 12. Looking at the bare-handed man was like looking through some special window at my oldest son, 20 or 30 years from now. It was like being run over by a freight train. I was washed by a wave of clarity and my eyes and heart were now open to what was happening in front of me. Suddenly I was transformed from a person trying to avoid the whole situation into a parent, filled with compassion and understanding. He again asked me to buy him food because he was hungry and gloves because his hands were cold. Something about him was so familiar. Yes, I would buy him some food. I would never deny any of my children food if they were hungry. He smiled in my direction and took my hand without looking at me and led me into the store. His hands were cold, hardened and chapped. I noticed the looks people gave me as I walked with the bare-handed man into the grocery store. His clothes were old, beaten up and had a foul odor. He asked me to buy him a gift card so he could buy food later, when he would be hungry again. So we walked over to the rack and he picked out a Giant Eagle gift card. I put $25 on the gift card. I gave him $25 in cash and asked him to please buy some gloves and a bus ride to the shelter. He asked for the receipt so ""When the police stop me, I can prove I didn't steal this."" He told me again that he wasn't lying. I told him I knew he wasn't. He turned to walk away, stopped and looked in my direction as if to say ""Thank you,"" but didn't. What he did said more than a simple thank you. He showed me his eyes again for a brief moment before he turned around and left. I was beside myself with grief. How could someone I didn't know have such a profound effect on me? It took everything I had not to burst into tears. I just couldn't shake just how much the bare-handed man reminded me of my oldest son. Their eyes, mannerisms and even the way they speak were so similar. My son struggles with boundaries and personal space simply because he doesn't understand, not because he wants to be invasive. All I could think was, ""How does this happen?"" I was smacked in the face with reality. Related story: Parents of autistic children who ""take nothing for granted"" Someday I won't be here to take care of my children. What if this happens to them? What if they are the ones wiping off a windshield with their bare hands and almost being run over by someone who doesn't care? I can't let that happen. I won't let that happen. Since that cold February day in 2011, I have met the bare-handed man on a few more occasions. Along the way, I learned that his name is Tim and that he remembers me. Tim has shown me just how much work still needs to be done. I would like to think that my experience that day -- the way people treated Tim in that frozen parking lot -- was an isolated incident. Sadly, I know it's not. Things like this happen all the time. To this writer and father of three beautiful boys on the autism spectrum, this is simply unacceptable. We need to do what we can to help the world better understand both children and adults with autism. I'm terrified of what the future might hold for my children. I have witnessed how cruel and unforgiving the world can be to people who are perceived as different. It is an ugly reality but one I'm working to help change. Please help spread autism awareness, even if it's one person at a time. Remember that the autistic children of today will be the autistic adults of tomorrow. These people need and deserve our compassion, understanding and respect. Let's help to ensure that what happened to my friend Tim in the parking lot of the Giant Eagle doesn't have to happen to anyone else, ever again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rob Gorski.","Rob Gorski is father to three sons with autism and blogs at ""Lost and Tired""

"(CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called a fire raging through boardwalk buildings Thursday an ""unthinkable situation"" as firefighters continued to fight the high flames and black smoke in Seaside Park, New Jersey. Christie said 35 engine companies, 15 ladders and 400 firefighters remained on the scene Thursday evening. So far, dozens of businesses have been burned and damaged over four blocks. Some embers hit a condominium, but it was quickly put out, Christie said. Several firefighters have sustained minor injuries, including heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation, Christie said. The fire was still burning along Ocean Terrace Avenue between Stockton Avenue and Lincoln Avenue Thursday evening. Christie said he was notified of the fire shortly after 3:30 p.m. ET. A cause has not been determined. The damage is almost entirely on the boardwalk, Christie said. Fire personnel dug a 20-foot trench on Lincoln Avenue; ""that's where firefighters are making their stand right now,"" Christie said. Brisk winds are spreading the fire, Christie said. ""The destruction south of Lincoln Avenue, it's complete,"" Christie said Thursday. ""I said to my staff, I feel like I want to throw up, and that's me. After all the effort and time and resources that we've put in to help the folks in Seaside Park and Seaside Heights rebuild. To see this going on, as I said at the top, is just unthinkable."" The famous boardwalk of Seaside Heights was thrown into the public eye shortly after Superstorm Sandy tore its famous Jet Star roller coaster into the water. The coaster was removed from the ocean in May, shortly before the boardwalk reopened for business. The FunTown Pier was destroyed by Sandy and partially reopened this summer. Seaside Heights Mayor Bill Akers told CNN in May that rebuilding the boardwalk cost $8 million. The total cost for Sandy repairs in Seaside Heights was $16 million. Christie explained that fire troops were experiencing water supply challenges because of damage to the system post Sandy, and that teams were drawing lines from Barnegat Bay. CNN affiliate KYW reported that the fire started at Kohr Brothers frozen custard shop on the FunTown Amusement Pier around 2:15 p.m. ET. The fire escalated to six alarms shortly before 4 p.m. ET, according to the same affiliate. Jersey Central Power and Light spokesman Ron Morano said their crews are in the area and that he is not aware of any outages due to the fire.

"(CNN) -- Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and the Seven Dwarves are not the U.S.-friendly images usually associated with Iran. But in a small corner of Tehran, a surprising display of unofficial Disney diplomacy seems to fly in the face of official anti-American rhetoric. Visitors to Eram Park, in the west of the capital, are greeted with numerous images of Disney characters, as well as other familiar American cartoon characters such as Shrek. Elsewhere, outside of the city, is another unexpected sight: A club dedicated to the U.S.-invented Segway people transporters. For roller coaster obsessive and self-styled ""Theme Park Guy"" Stefan Zwanzger, who toured Tehran's funfairs last month, the presence of these American icons offered more thrills than the rides on offer. ""You see badly-copied Mickeys and Donald Ducks all over the world, for example in copycat theme parks in rural China, but I didn't expect to see Shrek and Segways in Iran,"" Zwanzger told CNN. A German citizen now living in Stockholm, Sweden, Zwanzger, 32, could be forgiven for having preconceptions when visiting Iran. Nuclear ambitions, major protests after President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad's disputed 2009 election victory and frequent reports of repression have all done little for the country's global reputation. But, says Zwanzger -- whose four-year quest to visit all the world's major theme parks has so far taken him to 150 on five continents -- the Iran he encountered seemed a world away from the grim headlines. He says the Iranians he encountered were ""open-minded, unprejudiced, hospitable, warm and cultured,"" sharing views that appeared to contrast with those expressed by the country's leaders. ""What surprised me is that I didn't even get the slightest cultural shock. The Iranians I met made me feel like I was in Europe,"" he said. His views reflect a 2008 WorldPublicOpinion.org survey that claims ordinary Iranian people are largely open to contacts with Westerners. Nevertheless, countries such as Britain and the U.S., which has no diplomatic relations with Tehran, caution against travel there. International sanctions in place against Iran also mean western companies cannot operate easily in the country. Whereas on the streets of Tehran, U.S. icons such as the Statue of Liberty are used to create striking anti-American graffiti, Zwanzger witnessed Mickey Mouse and his pals being pressed into far less sinister tasks. At Eram Park, Mickey simply welcomes people to the funfair, while the Dwarves urge people to enjoy themselves. Shrek offers tickets to ride and Donald Duck helpfully points to the exit. As with his other experiences of places including North Korea, Zwanzger says Iran's theme parks offer a glimpse of the country's citizens as they relax and forget their day-to-day concerns, even if the rides struggle to merit the low admission fees. ""I highly recommend Iran as a place to visit. It's a beautiful country with fantastic people. The local amusement parks provide great opportunity to mingle with locals."" Sadly, with their rusting roller coasters and ""drainingly dull"" side shows, not even the presence of Mickey, Shrek and the Dwarves could save Iran's theme parks from rating badly on Zwanzger's score card. He says one ride, in which visitors are squeezed into a car shaped like a soda can before being hurtled around a cramped roller coaster circuit, could be world-beatingly bad. ""The yellow soda can-shaped roller coaster in Eram Park -- I'm still trying to find out who the manufacturer was, even my specialist friends don't know -- was maybe the worst I have ever experienced. ""I was scared. The loop is the tightest I have ever seen and the vehicle's headrests are too low to keep your head stable. You can hear the riders' joyful screams rise when the coaster plunges into the loop and vanish within a second once they enter the murderous brain-turner itself. ""It was genuinely unpleasant and leaves you with some neck pain to remember.""","Disney characters make unexpected appearances all over Tehran's amusement parks .

"(CNN) -- Internet users around the globe are facing slowed-down service, thanks to what's being called the biggest cyberattack in history. The prolonged denial-of-service assault is targeting The Spamhaus Project, a European spam-fighting group that has gone after CyberBunker, a data-storage company that offers to host any content ""except child porn and anything related to terrorism."" The organization has been in a long-running feud with CyberBunker and claims spammers use it as a host from which to spray junk mail across the Web. Internet security firm CloudFlare said Spamhaus contacted it last week, saying it had been hit with an attack big enough to knock its site offline. Security experts say the attack uses more sophisticated techniques than most DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks and targets the Web's infrastructure, which has led to other sites performing slowly. ""It's the biggest attack we've seen,"" Matthew Prince, CloudFlare's CEO, told CNN. The FBI is involved in the investigation into the cyberattack on Spamhaus, though a bureau spokesman didn't provide any details on the FBI's role or the scope of the probe. The Spamhaus Project is a nonprofit organization that patrols the Internet for spammers and publishes a list of Web servers those spammers use. According to Prince, the group may be responsible for up to 80% of all spam that gets blocked. This month, the group added CyberBunker to its blacklist. ""While we don't know who was behind this attack, Spamhaus has made plenty of enemies over the years,"" Prince wrote in a blog post. ""Spammers aren't always the most lovable of individuals, and Spamhaus has been threatened, sued and DDoSed regularly."" In a DDoS attack, computers flood a website with requests, overwhelming its servers and causing it to crash or become inaccessible for many users. One way to defend against those attacks, Prince said, is to deflect some of the traffic targeted at a single server onto a bunch of other servers at different locations. That's what happened in this case, and why Web users experienced some slowdowns on other sites. He told CNN the last big wave of the attack hit Tuesday morning, but that he doesn't ""live under the illusion"" that there won't be more. For its part, CyberBunker isn't taking credit for the attack. But the Dutch company, housed in a former NATO nuclear bunker, isn't shying away, either. ""This here is the internet community puking out SpamHaus,"" CyberBunker founder Sven Olaf Kamphuis told CNN. ""We've had it with the guys ... . What we see right here is the internet puking out a cancer."" He said the owners of various websites got together on a Skype chat and hatched the plans for the attack. He says that StopHaus, a group organized to support CyberBunker in the dispute, ceased the attack after three days but that other hackers and activists kept it up after that. Kamphuis and other critics say that Spamhaus oversteps its bounds and has essentially destroyed innocent websites in its spam-fighting efforts. ""Spamhaus itself is a more urgent danger"" than spam, Kamphuis told CNN. ""Pointing at websites and saying they want it shut down and then they get it shut down without any court order. That is a significantly larger threat to internet and freedom of speech and net neutrality than anything else."" Vincent Hanna, a researcher with The Spamhaus Project, said the group's record speaks for itself. He said the project has existed for over 12 years and its data is used to protect more than 1.7 billion e-mail accounts worldwide. ""We have 1.7 billion people looking over our shoulders to make sure we do our job right,"" he said. ""If we start blocking things they want, they won't use our data any more."" He emphasized that Spamhaus doesn't have the power to block e-mail from anyone -- it merely makes its data available for service providers and other Web companies to use. Hanna said Spamhaus experienced its first denial-of-service attack in 2003. ""This has been the biggest for us,"" he said, ""but certainly not the first one."" Cloudflare's Prince said denying access to a website through cyberattacks is the truest assault on Web freedom. ""Our role is to allow the internet to achieve what it aspires to -- that anyone, anywhere can publish any piece of information and make it accessible to anyone, anywhere else in the world,"" he said. ""It's blatant censorship. ""Whether Spamhaus is a good organization or a bad organization is irrelevant to me. We protect American financial institutions, which some people think are evil, and we protect WikiLeaks, which some people think are evil."" CNN's Atika Shubert, Antonia Mortensen and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","NEW: The FBI is involved in the investigation into the cyberattack, a spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- This isn't your classic Western movie where you'll find a solitary tumbleweed rolling through a desolate landscape. These are neighborhoods around Colorado Springs, where a strange takeover of tumbleweeds started last week. The clusters of twisted foliage are causing a lot of problems, says Mahkya Askew, a resident of Colorado Springs. Askew was driving with his father, who is visiting from the East Coast, when they came across a large pileup of tumbleweeds in his neighborhood. ""It looked like a scene from the 'Wizard of Oz,'"" he said. Askew, who works for the U.S. military, has been living in the area for 14 years and said he has never seen tumbleweeds like this before. ""They usually collect on the side of my yard, but lately they've been piling up on top of each other, and they can get as tall as a six-foot tall fence,"" he explained. Unusually high winds are blamed for the influx of tumbleweeds into neighborhoods south of Colorado Springs, according to CNN's affiliate KCNC-TV. Askew said they've definitely become a nuisance for him and others in his area. ""I don't even know what they are or what they break off from,"" he said. Tumbleweeds can be any sort of dried up plant that, once matured, breaks off from its roots and tumbles away with the wind. They have collected against people's homes, forming makeshift walls and blocking sidewalks and driveways. Colorado residents are using rakes and even snowplows to clean up these pesky, dried plants, especially because they can pose a fire hazard during dry conditions. Whitney Grant, 27, also a Colorado Springs resident, says tumbleweeds are a familiar sight. But she was surprised to find them barricading people inside their homes and even finding their way inside buildings. She and her daughter found a straggling tumbleweed inside a local Walmart over the weekend, in the electronics aisle. Grant said her daughter, who is 3, knew that tumbleweed didn't belong indoors. ""She said, 'Look mommy!' And she looked at me like she wanted me to fix the situation."" ""My friends who visit are always shocked to see them,"" she said. ""There was someone who left their garage open (on Friday), and it was filled with them,"" she said. As funny as this may all sound, Askew said that the tumbleweed situation has gotten pretty serious. ""It becomes a problem as you are driving; they can scratch your car. They can get stuck under your car, too, and you can hear it dragging underneath you,"" he said. An active runner, he's found himself in the past few days having to jump over tumbleweeds more than a foot tall. ""They can be huge, and they are really prickly,"" he said. ""I'm from the East, so when my family comes to visit me, they get a crack out of this. It's like a Western movie, but it is really bad.""

"(CNN) -- Pakistani government representatives on Wednesday met the Taliban for peace talks in the tribal region of North Waziristan, in the first direct contact between the two sides. Militants from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, have long conducted an insurgency against the Pakistani government and have claimed a number of violent attacks. The government team flew by helicopter from Peshawar to meet the Taliban negotiators at an undisclosed location, sources and state media said. TTP spokesman Shahidullah Shahid told CNN the talks, which ended in the evening, were held in a conducive environment. He said both sides had agreed to extend a cease-fire, agreed on March 1, and that there was consensus on the exchange of noncombatants held by both sides. He said both sides were optimistic. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced the initiative this year, but talks broke down last month in the wake of attacks by the group. The government said extension of the cease-fire would top the agenda at the talks, according to Pakistan's APP news agency. It also quoted a Taliban committee member as saying his side was demanding the release of noncombatants . The militants, who are fighting for their austere version of Sharia law across Pakistan, have repeatedly rejected the country's constitution. Since taking office last year, Sharif faced mounting pressure to bring the violence under control. Pakistan suspends peace talks with Pakistani Taliban .

"London (CNN) -- Prince Philip, husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, underwent ""exploratory"" abdominal surgery Friday at a London hospital, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to the hospital Thursday and is expected to stay there for up to two weeks, according to the palace statement. He is being treated ""following abdominal investigations."" The surgery took place Friday, the palace said. It went as planned, and Philip is ""progressing satisfactorily."" The 91-year-old is set to celebrate his birthday Monday. He had been expected to accompany the queen as she formally opened the British Broadcasting Corporation's rebuilt central London headquarters, Broadcasting House, on Friday. She toured the broadcaster's main newsroom and radio studios, and made a live appearance on the BBC news. The prince showed no signs of illness Thursday at a presentation at Buckingham Palace, according to the Press Association. The news agency reported Philip was joking and laughing with guests at a ceremony where the queen made him a member of the Order of New Zealand. After the presentation, the queen and Philip hosted a garden party in the grounds of Buckingham Palace as part of celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the queen's coronation. He and other members of the royal family also attended a service at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday to mark the anniversary. Prince Philip: The man behind the queen . Philip left Greece a year after he was born there, following the 1922 overthrow of his uncle King Constantine I. Despite his roots in that country, he has a mixed ancestry and, like his wife, is a great-great-grandchild of Britain's Queen Victoria. A Royal Navy veteran, he met Elizabeth in 1939 and married her in November 1947. They have four children. In addition to his royal and military duties, Philip has served as president of the World Wildlife Fund and the International Equestrian Foundation. Philip has had a number of documented health problems in recent years, including treatment for a blocked coronary artery in December 2011 and a hospitalization in June 2012 for a bladder infection. He was admitted again to a hospital -- this time in Scotland -- for treatment of the latter ailment two months later.

"(CNN) -- At least 70 people are reported to have died from Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Guinea, according to a statement from the West African nation's health ministry. Officials say there are at least 111 suspected cases of the viral disease, which spreads in the blood and shuts down the immune system, causing high fever, headache and muscle pain. The virus is transmitted by contact with the fluids of infected people or animals. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) describes Ebola as ""one of the world's most deadly diseases."" It is rare, but it creates panic, because there is no cure and it's fatal in most cases, according to MSF. ""The priority is to isolate suspected cases,"" said MSF, which has set up two isolation facilities in the most affected districts, Gueckedou and Macenta, both in southern Guinea. Four of the fatalities from the disease are in Conakry, the capital city, which is on the coast. Genetic analysis of the virus shows that it is closely related to Zaire Ebola virus, which was reported in 2009 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Senegal's Interior Ministry decided to close its border with Guinea until further notice to prevent the spread of the disease, according to Senegal's state news agency. The World Health Organization says that, to date, no confirmed cases of Ebola have been found outside of Guinea, but at least 12 suspected cases are under investigation in neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone.

"(CNN) -- It's a long way from the bits and bytes of Silicon Valley to the bright lights of Broadway. But former Facebook exec Randi Zuckerberg is ready for her turn on stage. Zuckerberg, the sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, will do a two-week stint in ""Rock of Ages,"" the Tony Award-nominated musical that celebrates the glam-metal rock of the 1980s. Her appearance is part of a ""social networking"" promotion by the show, now in its fifth year. (It also inspired a 2012 movie with Tom Cruise.) ""For over 2,000 performances 'Rock of Ages' has taken audiences on a wild ride back to when 'social' meant something very different,"" producer Matthew Weaver said on the show's website. ""Every performance, for the last five years, has delivered an incredible onstage and audience experience, earning the show its title as Broadway's Best Party.

Zuckerberg, now CEO of Zuckerberg Media and author of New York Times bestseller, ""Dot Complicated: Untangling Our Wired Lives,"" confirmed as much on her Facebook page. ""Friends, it's official! I'm joining the cast of Rock of Ages on Broadway from March 14-28!!! #LifeDreamComeTrue #Iwannarock,"" she wrote. It's her first time on Broadway -- and likely a first for any dotcom exec -- but Zuckerberg is no stranger behind the microphone. She sings in a band called Feedbomb, made up of current and former Facebook employees. The lighthearted group's numbers range from Cee-Lo's ""Forget You"" to a Carly Rae Jepsen parody, ""Fund Me Maybe."" ""Theater-going is one of the few sacred activities where audiences truly unplug and enjoy the moment with the live entertainment right in front of them,"" Zuckerberg said in the statement.

"(CNN) -- The new report out of the Congressional Budget Office confirms what Republicans have said all along: Raising the minimum wage could cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. Under normal circumstances, this would be a devastating blow to the Democrats. But these are exciting times. Now, evidence of one thing from nonpartisan sources can be mined and manipulated to read as evidence of the opposite. Earlier, when the CBO said the Affordable Care Act could make 2 million Americans less likely to seek work, that was spun by the left as: Obamacare releases 2 million workers from the pressures of ""job lock."" The minimum wage report is also being spun. In the moments after the report was released, Democrats were already pulling the ""good"" bits from the report to tout the strength of their prior arguments. Both sides do that, of course. But the problem with this is that the ""good"" talking point Democrats are celebrating is one that was never questioned. By anyone. The ""revelation"" that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would increase hourly wages for millions of people hardly warrants the ""I told you so"" Dems want to deliver. It more warrants a ""no duh."" After all, is anyone truly surprised that paying people more money will mean they make more money? Where Democrats can't get off so easy is on the news that raising the minimum wage will result in a loss of half a million jobs. Although some will try to shrug that off -- such as @benadgatemusic, who tweeted at me, ""oh noooooo .03% of the workforce! Nice concern trolling, S.E."" -- most serious folks will recognize that's no small number. But time and time again, Democrats have insisted that raising the minimum wage will not result in less hiring despite everything you or I have ever learned about supply and demand economics. Paul Krugman, for example: ""The great preponderance of the evidence from these natural experiments points to little if any negative effect of minimum wage increases on employment."" Robert Reich, for another: ""It has been raised consistently, and it has never actually killed jobs. In fact, there has been no relationship between raising the minimum wage and losing jobs."" President Barack Obama: There's ""no solid evidence that a higher minimum wage costs jobs."" This puts Democrats in a tricky position. Instead of being a little less committed to an economic principle they should have known to be false, they doubled down. Now they're left explaining not only why raising the minimum wage is still a good idea but why they didn't seem to anticipate these findings. They can spin this all they want. And I'll even throw them a bone -- the report also says that raising the minimum wage will reduce the number of people living in poverty by an estimated 900,000. That's a good thing. The question we have to ask ourselves: Would that be that worth the potential loss of 500,000 jobs? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S.E. Cupp.","S. E.

"(CNN) -- Locked away deep beneath the sea off Cyprus' southern shores lays a treasure chest of natural gas that could ease the country's economic plight. Still reeling from the infectious banking crisis that exploded at the beginning of 2013, Cyprus' government hopes the Aphrodite gas field, discovered two years ago, will help lift the country out of the economic doldrums. Named after the goddess of love, the ""Lady of Cyprus"" gas field could contain up to six trillion feet of cubic gas. Just 0.5 trillion cubic feet of gas could provide Cypriots with energy for 25 years, leaving ample reserves for export to Asia and Europe, Cyprus' Energy Minister Giorgos Lakkotryis told CNN in an interview. But the minister was quick to stress that offshore gas operations would not solve Cyprus' economic anguish in the short-term. ""We do not depend on the offshore operations and the gas to come out of this recession,"" said Lakkotryis. ""In the mid- and short-term we're looking at side effect benefits."" Read more: Cyprus country profile . Lakkotryis believes it will take until 2020 before Cyprus sees any direct benefit from the gas. ""A lot needs to be done. The cheap availability of energy is also going to allow us to create other industries such as petrochemicals and heavy manufacturing,"" he said . The minister added that multinational oil and gas companies as well as infrastructure projects aimed at converting gas to liquid would create jobs, spur growth and boost exports. A long term project . Oil and gas giants Total, ENI and Texas-based Noble Energy have all secured contracts to operate in the Aphrodite field with extensive exploration and drilling set to begin in October 2014, lasting for 12 months, according to the energy ministry. However, the 150-kilometer distance between the gas field and Cyprus' shores could delay operations. ""Because of the distance offshore, the field would require a pipeline to reach the mainland of Cyprus at which point it could be used for domestic economy or LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) export,"" said Keith Elliott, senior vice president of Eastern Mediterranean Region of Noble Energy. The government says it is planning to finalize investment and build an onshore LNG plant while using Cyprus' proximity to the Suez Canal and its ties with Europe to exploit export opportunities in Asia and Europe respectively. But Amit Mor, CEO of Eco Energy Financial and Strategic Consulting and former World Bank consultant, said that Cyprus ""cannot economically justify even one LNG plant"" based on current reserves. He added that Cyprus could possibly build a plant if the country reached an agreement to liquefy excess Israeli gas from the country's Tamar and Leviathan fields, which are significantly bigger than Cyprus' Aphrodite field. ""Cyprus itself is a small market that does not justify the financing efforts,"" Mor said. ""One LNG plant incurs $6 billion in construction costs. The development cost of a major offshore gas field could reach $4 billion (while) exporting natural gas via ships in liquid form is a very expensive and time consuming process."" According to Eurostat, Cypriot residents are subject to the highest electricity bills in the European Union because the country produces power by burning oil. But by switching to gas and converting its power stations Cyprus could alleviate some of the financial burden on consumers. ""The Cypriot people need to much more patient. It takes a lot of time to discover and develop oil and gas fields. In the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea for example it took 10 to 20 years,"" said Mor. A brighter future . The discovery of gas and the inward investment from global energy companies is a silver lining for Cyprus at time of pervasive economic gloom. In March, a banking crisis shattered the country's economy; destroyed Cyprus' second largest bank and threatened the life savings of thousands of residents. Read more: Does Cyprus have the world's oldest wine? Subsequently, the East Mediterranean island became the fourth country to receive a national bailout from the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund. Charles Movit, senior economist at U.S.-based consultancy IHS, said the benefits of gas reserves could help Cyprus service its debt: ""In the medium term, license fees for exploration and development could be helpful in closing the financing gap. Down the road, royalties and job creation could be a major plus."" With gas sources in the North Sea expected to decline over the next decade and few countries willing to invest in nuclear energy in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in Japan, Cyprus could also provide the answer to Europe's energy demands as it seeks to decrease its dependency on Russian gas. ""A pipeline between Israel and Cyprus to Europe via Crete and Greece would cost $6 billion to $8 billion... I think it is very important to conduct a feasibility study to see if this is economically viable,"" said Mor. In the meantime, Cypriots struggling under the weight of a recession are hoping the government's predictions are correct and that gas could ultimately provide the basis for ending the economic crisis. CNN's On the Road series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile. However CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy .","Cypriot gas reserves in the offshore Aphrodite Field are estimated to be between 3.6 and 6 trillion cubic feet.

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- If you're cursing at work, be careful. While it's commonplace to curse once in a while and may even help you build a bond with co-workers, there's a fine line to when and how you curse. ""We are being judged constantly by our co-workers for how we do our work and how we interact with them,"" says etiquette expert Cynthia Lett. ""Cursing is an aggressive and hostile way of expressing oneself."" Companies where employees are constantly in front of customers are especially harsh when it comes to foul language -- employees caught cursing can be in trouble. Not sure where you stand when it comes to cursing? Here's how foul language at work can impact your career: . Reveal an unprofessional attitude . In some professions cursing is accepted and can even help you fit in to an environment, perhaps in high-pressure jobs where everyone needs to let off some steam. Constantly using foul language, however, can make it difficult to fit into a professional environment, says Jennifer Kahnweiler, author of ""The Introverted Leader: Building on Your Quiet Strength."" ""Perceptions are important in shaping your career -- you don't want to be seen as that foul-mouthed person,"" she says. Be especially careful about your language when surrounded by several co-workers at once -- such as during meetings or when working in teams. Prevent real communication . Using curse words over and over again can prevent you from truly communicating what you're trying to say. Instead of cursing, take the time to figure out how to let your co-workers understand what you're really thinking. Even if you're angry or upset, take time to develop a professional communication strategy. ""Cursing is an aggressive and hostile way of expressing one's self,"" Lett says. Furthermore it can create a distance between you and the others in your department because it makes others uncomfortable. ""When people are uncomfortable around someone they avoid them whenever possible,"" she explains. Hamper your image . Similar to a disheveled appearance or tardiness, foul language can impact the way you're perceived by others in the workplace. Even if you do great work, cursing can have an impact on your ability to get promoted or get better job responsibilities. ""You need to be aware of how you present yourself to your co-workers, superiors and clients,"" says Suzanne Lucas, a writer and human resources expert. ""Swearing when books get dropped on your toes or the copier dies on you is one thing, peppering your daily conversation with expletives is another."" Repercussions from human resources . Just because no one in your department comments on your use of foul language, doesn't mean it's going unnoticed. In some instances it can be reported to human resources with an official warning. Sometimes it can even get you fired. ""Someone who works customer facing [roles] -- such as retail or sales or call centers -- would be fired for swearing, as it's not appropriate with a customer,"" Lucas says. Of course not everyone gets fired. And as you evaluate your behavior, cursing once in a while is no cause for alarm. ""We all get angry and frustrated and using a curse word can be the best release available,"" says Kahnweiler. ""Just be aware that this language shouldn't become your M.O. or you could be seen as lacking self control."" &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- China spoke out strongly Sunday against a meeting between U.S. President Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama, saying it ""hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and harmed Sino-U.S. relations."" ""This action seriously interfered with China's internal affairs,"" said Ma Zhaoxu, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, in a statement, adding that officials have lodged formal complaints with their U.S. counterparts in Beijing and Washington. Obama met with the Dalai Lama on Saturday in Washington, commending the Tibetan spiritual leader on his commitment to nonviolence and pursuit of the ""Middle Way"" approach with China, the White House said in a statement. During the closed-door visit at the White House, Obama stressed the U.S. policy that ""Tibet is a part of the People's Republic of China and the United States does not support independence for Tibet,"" the White House said. In the nearly 45-minute meeting, the president voiced support for ""direct dialogue"" between China and Tibet as a way to peace, the statement said. ""The Dalai Lama stated that he is not seeking independence for Tibet and hopes that dialogue between his representatives and the Chinese government can soon resume,"" the White House said. American support of the Dalai Lama has long been a subject of contention in U.S.-China relations. Chinese officials view the religious leader as a separatist. The issue of Tibet is one that ""involves China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement released before the meeting. ""We oppose foreign leaders meeting with the Dalai Lama in any format."" The strong objection to the meeting continued after it was over. ""By allowing the Dalai Lama to visit the U.S. and arranging the top leader to meet him, the United States has seriously violated basic principles of international relations and its own repeated solemn pledges, and harmed Sino-U.S. relations,"" Ma's statement said. ""China therefore expresses its strong indignation and firm opposition."" The statement concluded by calling on the U.S. ""to take China's solemn and just stance seriously, and adopt immediate measures to eliminate adverse consequences."" The president last met with his fellow Nobel Peace laureate in February 2010. The Dalai Lama expressed hopes that his relationship with China can improve, with U.S. help. The current Dalai Lama is also known by the name Tenzin Gyatso. He was born in 1935 in modern-day Qinghai, China. The term ""Dalai Lama"" is a Buddhist religious title. In traditional Tibetan belief, the title is given to those who are the reincarnations of a line of revered religious teachers. The current Dalai Lama is considered the 14th in this line. The Dalai Lama has been in Washington on an 11-day visit. He has conducted a mass ritual for Buddhists and met with several lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

"(CNN) -- Organizers of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar would be willing to host the tournament in winter if there was sufficient demand from the global football community. The quadrennial tournament is usually hosted in June and July -- during European soccer's offseason -- but there are concerns over the oppressive heat in Qatar in those months, though a switch to December or January would cause disruption to a number of major domestic leagues. ""Our position hasn't changed,"" a Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee spokesman told CNN. ""We've always reiterated that we entered the bidding race with the intention of hosting in the summer and are continuing with our plans to deliver a World Cup in the summer unless there is a unified consensus among the international football community for alternative plans."" A potential switch has been a topic of discussion since Qatar was awarded the World Cup by world governing body FIFA in December 2010. Michel Platini, the head of European governing body UEFA, told British newspaper the London Evening Standard he hoped the 2022 competition would be staged across November and December. ""We have to go to Qatar when it is good for everybody to participate. What is better for the fans?"" said the UEFA president. ""In 10 years we can manage to decide how we can postpone the season for one month. January is difficult for the World Cup because you have the Winter Olympic Games. ""If we stop from 2 November to 20 December it means, instead of finishing in May, we stop in June. It is not a big problem. It is for the good of the World Cup, the most important competition in the world."" Frenchman Platini voted for the tournament to be played in Qatar on the grounds it would take the World Cup to a region it had never been to before. ""I voted for Qatar because it was time to go to a country in that part of the world,"" said Platini. ""They bid five times."" The former Juventus player, who was European Footballer of the Year in 1984, also denied he had elected to back Qatar after being asked to do so by French president Nicolas Sarkozy. ""One day I was invited to dinner by Sarkozy where there was the prime minister of Qatar,"" said Platini. ""Mr Sarkozy never asked me during the dinner to vote for Qatar. They invited me to the dinner but they know I will be independent, that I will vote for who I want."" The decision to award Qatar football's biggest event has been surrounded by controversy, particularly over the world governing body's decision to decide the fate of both the 2018 and 2022 hosts at the same time with the suggestion it encouraged voting collusion between bids -- an accusation FIFA has denied. FIFA itself has been plagued by allegations of corruption and bribery. Concerns were also raised for gay fans planning on attending the tournament as homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, with FIFA president Sepp Blatter criticized for suggesting homosexual fans should refrain from sexual activity while visiting the country.","Qatar World Cup 2022 organizers open to hosting the tournament in winter .

"(CNN) -- The murder trial of ""Blade Runner"" Oscar Pistorius will now continue until the middle of May, the South African court hearing the case said Sunday. The trial, which enters its fourth week on Monday, will continue until April 4, then break for a one-week recess before resuming from April 14 until May 16, the Pretoria court announced in a written statement. It said ""all parties involved"" had agreed to the dates. Pistorius, 27, admits firing the shots that killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year but has pleaded not guilty to murder, saying he thought she was a burglar and he believed he was acting in self-defense. He fired four shots through the door to the toilet room in his house in the middle of the night, probably killing Steenkmap almost instantly with the shot to the head, according to the autopsy. The trial began on March 3. After 13 days of hearings, the court has heard only 18 witnesses out of a potential 107. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel announced unexpectedly on Wednesday that the prosecution expects to rest early next week. Nel has only four or five more witnesses to call, he declared to the shock of the courtroom just before lunch on the 13th day of the trial. He requested and got an adjournment until Monday to consider the state's position in the case. The surprise move prompted questions about whether Nel was thinking about throwing in the towel, whether he had surprise new evidence to study, or whether the state's case was simply running ahead of schedule. Intense media interest . Almost the entire trial has been televised, though individual witnesses can choose not to be shown on television. There has been intense media interest in the case in South Africa and beyond. Pistorius first achieved global fame as an outstanding double amputee sprinter who ran with special prostheses that earned him the nickname ""Blade Runner."" Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict with the help of two lay people called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each of two unrelated gun indictments and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence. The sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge's discretion. Last week Pistorius said he would sell his home to fund legal costs. The house is where Steenkamp was shot dead. Pistorius hasn't returned since her death, according to a statement on his website. READ MORE: Gruesome crime scene photos sicken Pistorius .

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- A Qatari judge sentenced California couple Grace and Matthew Huang to three years in prison after they were found guilty in the death of their 8-year-old adopted daughter. ""We have just been wrongfully convicted and we feel as if we are being kidnapped by the Qatar judicial system,"" a distraught Matthew Huang told reporters outside the court Thursday. ""This verdict is wrong and appears to be nothing more a than an effort to save face."" The couple was accused of murdering their daughter, Gloria, by starving her to death. But the judge did not specify the exact charge for which they were convicted. The judge's order calls for the couple's deportation after the serve their sentence. They were also fined about $4,120 each. The couple has two weeks to appeal the verdict. The Huangs deny charges of killing their daughter, who died in January last year. ""The prosecutor accused us of trafficking our legal adopted children with the intent of selling their organs. That is how ridiculous this is,"" Matthew Huang said outside the courtroom. ""So we are calling on the United States President Obama to call the head of state in Qatar."" But prosecutors argued that the evidence proved the couple deliberately starved Gloria. In intentionally neglecting to take her to a doctor when they found out she had not eaten for days, the couple caused her death, prosecutors said. Medical reports presented to the court concluded that the victim died of starvation and that her body was emaciated, the prosecution said. It added that witnesses testified the girl was locked up in her room and was deprived of food. Defense lawyer Sami Abou-Sheikha, who asked for an acquittal, said Gloria died of other reasons. Referring to the same reports as the prosecution, he said the girl had an inflamed pancreas and lung, stool that showed traces of food, and her bladder retained liquid. Gloria always had water bottles in her room and had access to water from the bathroom in her room, the attorney said. The couple's two other sons returned to the United States after their parents' arrest.","The couple has two weeks to appeal the verdict .

"(CNN) -- One investigative tip can lead to another -- and another. Linda Abrams, a genealogy gumshoe, went to Texas to match handwriting samples. She spent a couple weeks in Kentucky following a tip, only to find it was just hearsay. Over the years, Germany has beckoned, too. Such are the destinations of the forensic genealogist who has used streetwise skills and her curiosity to dig a little deeper into the lives of the eight-man crew of the legendary H.L. Hunley, the first submarine to bring down an enemy ship. The crew didn't live to tell the story. The Hunley went to its watery tomb within an hour of its triumph -- if not much sooner. How was historic Civil War submarine lost? For Abrams, it's a world of win some, lose some and tangling with seeming dead ends. ""I don't think my part will ever be done. This was a tough case,"" says Abrams, who lives in western Massachusetts and has worked with the Hunley Project for more than a dozen years. Just how tough? Consider this: . -- Only one crew member on the Confederate submarine was believed to have had children, and a descendant living in Georgia has little source material about him. -- Four were European-born. (How researchers found that out is a fascinating tidbit). -- Only one, Joseph Ridgaway, has been positively identified through DNA. -- There are no known photos of any of the eight. Abrams and other such researchers can't afford to be happy with what is ""known"" about an individual. In the Hunley's case, that was precious little when they began. The hunt is about following a trail, following another -- and not being afraid to venture into a rabbit hole. The genealogist was to discuss her latest findings Saturday evening during a program at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center in North Charleston, South Carolina. Monday marks the 150th anniversary of the Hunley's attack during the Civil War. The lab houses the Hunley, which has been undergoing conservation treatment since it was raised a few miles off Charleston in 2000. It also has facial reconstructions of the crew and summaries of what is known about each. Monday evening, a memorial service on the tip of Sullivan's Island will remember the 13 men who died that night: the eight on the Hunley and five on its prey, the USS Housatonic. True romance, or just a fun legend? Lt. George Dixon, captain of the Hunley, typifies ongoing challenges for scientists and historians. A gold coin and a diamond ring and brooch were found with his remains. ""Dixon is still a mystery. Here is a guy making a mark for himself in the world, with some personal wealth,"" says Robert Neyland, head of underwater archeology for the Naval History and Heritage Command and former director of the Hunley Project. ""Where he came from, and his family, is a bit of mystery."" Abrams says the lieutenant was a riverman possibly from Pennsylvania or Ohio. She spent time doing research in Kentucky, but never was able to make a connection to a tip regarding Dixon. Today, he has no verified descendants. What he does have is a story that has become a legend of sorts. The gold coin he carried to his doom reportedly was given as a charm by his sweetheart, Queenie Bennett. The $20 piece deflected a Union bullet during the Battle of Shiloh and saved Dixon's life. He had the reverse side of the talisman engraved with the words, ""My life Preserver."" The Bennett story has never been proven; a supposed photo of the blond, blue-eyed Dixon did not match his skull. And the photo, along with letters about the supposed relationship, have disappeared. ""Officially, I cannot prove or disprove"" the romantic tale, says Kellen Correia, executive director of the Friends of the Hunley. ""It makes for a really good story. The Hunley is one of those (in which) you cannot pin it down."" 'That leads to more leads' Tests on the well-preserved skeletal remains showed the men to range in age from their late teens to mid-40s. Some had teeth that bore hallmarks of prolific pipe smoking. ""The (Hunley) Commission was sure these were ... Southern boys from South Carolina and Georgia,"" says Abrams. Instead, carbon isotope analysis revealed that four crew members were from Europe. The tests showed a diet rich in corn for the Americans and a wheat-based diet for the Europeans. Abrams, who also does contract genealogical research for the U.S. Army, says work on the Hunley provides inspiration and motivation to fill in gaps about the crew. For example, two members -- Lumpkin and Miller -- are known only by their last names. Experts were able to verify the identity, and correct spelling of Joseph Ridgaway's uncommon last name, through careful research of enlistment papers and DNA analysis. Abrams learned that the eastern Maryland sailor had two sisters buried in Pennsylvania. After permission was granted, a grave was exhumed and a DNA sample was taken from one sister's jawbone. The match was made. She also researched two men from a German artillery unit based in Charleston. They were late substitutes on the Hunley crew. The genealogist says she is impressed by Dixon's charisma and his ability to recruit crew members for the Hunley, which lost 13 men in previous operations. ""He was really gung-ho and believed that he would make a difference, that he would finally have success. It is like listening to a new boss at your company and how it makes you feel."" Her research, meanwhile, goes on. ""You find these things that begin to create a picture, a story of these guys,"" Abrams says. ""And then that leads to more leads."" North Carolina-born seaman James Wicks is the only Hunley crew member known to marry and have children. Wicks served on a Union vessel before jumping ship to fight for the South. Mary Elizabeth McMahon, a great-great granddaughter who lives in suburban Atlanta, says her family, unfortunately, has few records and no ""personal stories"" that were passed down. Still, she takes pride in the dangerous mission Wicks undertook on the Hunley. ""This was very risky and he knew it."" McMahon and about 25 relatives attended the April 2004 funeral in Charleston for the eight, who are buried near the remains of the two Hunley crews that died in previous mishaps. Recognizing sacrifice of those who wore blue, gray . Sunrise Presbyterian Church, on Sullivan's Island, is the location for Monday night's memorial service for those who died on the Hunley and Housatonic. Breathtaking views from the sanctuary's windows include Breach Inlet, where the Hunley began its mission on February 17, 1864. ""What is really unique is that it is a recognition of a sacrifice that took place on both sides of the conflict,"" says the Rev. Vance Polley. As a bell is tolled for each victim, a carnation will be handed to a woman dressed in black, 13 in all, representing family members of the lost. Sitting near them are re-enactors dressed in either blue or gray. A group of submariners from recent decades participate in the service, linking the past to the present. ""This was an American conflict and everyone gathered here are Americans. One of the great themes ... is that we are making sense out of a very divisive conflict,"" says the Rev. Polley. Members of the Confederate Heritage Trust will conduct a procession -- led by bagpipers -- from the church to the inlet, where flowers and memorial wreaths are placed in the water. ""It is done with a lot of dignity and with honor, for both crews,"" says Gene Patrick, the organization's president. Piece of Civil War ironclad brought to surface .

"(CNN) -- ""Make us dream"" read the message. As the Liverpool supporters danced and sang at the Theatre of Dreams, the nightmare continued for Manchester United manager David Moyes. A crushing 3-0 victory over United was the least Brendan Rodgers' side deserved as it outclassed and outfought an insipid and pitiful United. Two goals from Steven Gerrard, both from the penalty spot and a Luis Suarez strike, condemned United to defeat and gave yet more credence that Liverpool is a serious title contender. Liverpool, which sits four points behind leader Chelsea with a game in hand, was a class apart on an afternoon where United's deficiencies were laid bare for all to see. ""It's a fantastic day personally but we came here to win the game,"" Gerrard told Sky Sports. ""We'll enjoy tonight but we need to move on quickly. We've shown today we're genuine contenders and we'll fight to the end. ""We played a diamond today and totally bossed the midfield and controlled the game. The Manchester United defense will not have had a harder game than against our strikers today. ""We believe that we can win the league. But the easiest thing in football is to talk the talk. We have to treat Cardiff and Sunderland the same as Manchester United. I maybe got a bit cocky with the last penalty but scored the two that mattered most."" Last season, United finished 28 points clear of Liverpool on its way to winning the Premier League title. Now, Moyes' side is 14 points behind and faces the embarrassment of not even managing to qualify for European football. On Wednesday, United meets Greek side Olympiakos in the second leg of its last 16 Champions League tie needing to overturn a two-goal deficit to progress. Failure would represent another disastrous episode in Moyes' reign since replacing Alex Ferguson at the end of last season. Worse for United is the success of its greatest rival - Liverpool. A fifth successive league victory was recorded with consummate ease as United's lack of cohesion afforded the likes of Suarez and strike partner Daniel Sturridge more room than they could ever have imagined. Liverpool dominated the opening 45 minutes and went ahead when Rafael, already on a yellow card, handled inside the penalty area. Rafael, fortunate not to be sent off, then watched on as Gerrard expertly placed the ball into the corner. United, with Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie, all on the field, struggled to make any real impact. Its only real opportunity of the first half came when Rooney's fierce effort was tipped away by Simon Mignolet in the Liverpool goal. Quite what Moyes said to his players at halftime was unclear but he almost certainly not have expected what was to follow. Just 24 second had elapsed when Phil Jones clumsily bundled over Joe Allen in the United penalty area and Gerrard swept home the spot kick. United tried to respond and was unfortunate to be awarded a penalty when Glen Johnson appeared to handle. Van Persie sent a header wide of the post as the home side attempted to gain a foothold in the game. But any hope of a comeback should have been extinguished with 12 minutes to go when Nemanja Vidic was adjudged to have fouled Sturridge in the penalty area. Vidic was shown a second yellow card and promptly dismissed but Gerrard could only hit the post on this occasion. There was still time for Liverpool to appeal for a fourth penalty when Michael Carrick looked to have tripped Sturridge but referee Mark Clattenburg waved away the appeals. Suarez should have added a third after outpacing the United defense but David de Gea produced a sublime save to deny the Liverpool striker. But the Uruguayan didn't make the same mistake minutes later. Sturridge attempted a shot from the edge of the penalty area and when the ball was deflected into Suarez's path, the forward coolly slotted the ball home. The third and final goal sparked yet more jubilant scenes in the away section. ""We're going to win the league,"" sang the Liverpool supporters. Those chants may be premature but with Chelsea and Manchester City both still to visit Anfield, anything is possible. ""Make us dream"" read the banner -- those dreams could yet come true. Gunners . In the day's other game, Arsenal defeated north London rival Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Tomas Rosicky scored the only goal of the game after just 72 seconds. The victory moves Arsenal to within four points of leader Chelsea with a game in hand.","Liverpool defeats Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford .

"(CNN) -- From outward appearances Tuesday's special election to fill a vacant congressional seat in Florida doesn't seem to be that important. It's just one of 435 seats in the U.S. House, and the winner will serve out a term that comes to a close at the end of the year. But the contest for Florida 13 has landed smack in the middle of the national political spotlight. It's seen by some pundits as a bellwether for November's midterm elections, and there's been a massive infusion of outside ad money into the race to try to influence the outcome. A special election this far out from Election Day rarely gives us a preview of what will actually happen in November, but the party that does come out on top gets bragging rights until the next election. Empty your notebook: Republican finger-pointing in Florida . Democrat Alex Sink is running against Republican David Jolly to fill out the term of Republican Bill Young, who died in October. Young, first elected to Congress in 1970, was the longest-serving Republican in the House. Sink was Florida's chief financial officer and narrowly lost the 2010 gubernatorial election to Rick Scott. Jolly served as a former general counsel for Young and also worked as a lobbyist. There's also a libertarian candidate in the race. Here are five things we can learn from the race: . National parties test their pitches in Florida special election . 1. Swing district in a swing state: The district covers most of Pinellas County and parts of St. Petersburg near Tampa, and it's up for grabs. While Young captured 58% of the vote in his 2012 re-election, President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district. Obama also won it in 2008, grabbing 51% of the vote. It went for George W. Bush before that. Of those registered to vote in the district, 37% are Republicans, about 35% are Democrats and 28% are unaffiliated. Public opinion polls suggest the race remains close. With the number of competitive House seats shrinking with every cycle, Florida 13 is becoming something of a rarity. While both parties have a lot at stake, and both have tried to lower expectations, a top nonpartisan political handicapper says the Democrats have more to lose. ""It's rare in politics that anything other than a presidential contest is viewed as a must-win, but the special election in Florida's 13th District falls into that category for Democrats,"" wrote Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. Rothenberg points out that all things being equal, Sink should win, since she didn't have a primary challenge and had a money advantage, and Jolly had to continuously battle the lobbyist label. ""Since most nonpartisan handicappers and analysts have for years expected this seat to go Democratic when it became open, a Republican victory would likely say something about the national political environment and the inclination of district voters to send a message of dissatisfaction about the President. And that possibility should worry the White House,"" Rothenberg said. Eight things to watch till Election Day . 2. Is it all about Obamacare?: National Republicans are framing the election as a referendum on Obamacare. The National Republican Congressional Committee and pro-GOP outside groups link Sink to the health care law, to President Obama and to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. ""Canceled health plans. Higher premiums. Medicare cuts. People losing their doctors. A disaster for families and seniors. For Alex Sink the priority is Obamacare. Not us,"" says the narrator in a TV commercial by the Chamber of Commerce, which is backing Jolly. That's a potent message in a district that's one of the grayest in the nation. Nearly a quarter of all residents in Florida 13 are 65 or older. Jolly says he remains committed to getting rid of Obamacare entirely. Sink recognizes that Obamacare is a major issue. While she highlights how the Affordable Care Act has helped people, she also notes that the law has flaws, and says she's open to GOP proposals to amend some of the measure's requirements. ""Regardless of whether or not the election will tell us anything about November, the two political parties will learn lessons from this contest and apply them to future races,"" Rothenberg said. ""If Jolly wins, it's all about Obamacare for the GOP. And if Sink wins, Democrats will say that attacking Republican candidates on Medicare and Social Security works."" 3. Excitement could translate to turnout: While special elections typically see far lower turnout than general elections, the race in Florida could have a strong showing -- a statistic both sides will be eagerly trying to gauge to predict turnout in November. Early voting turnout is already higher than the total turnout for the last special election in Florida, when Democrat Ted Deutch won in 2010 after Democrat Robert Wexler resigned. Nancy Whitlock, a spokeswoman for Pinellas County elections, said about 27% of eligible voters in the district have already voted by mail or in person. By contrast, turnout for that 2010 special election was about 15% of eligible voters. That's the total figure, not just early voting. While registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats in the 13th District by about 11,350 voters, Democrats seem to be excited about the high early voting turnout so far. ""These are tests of turnout to some extent,"" Rothenberg said. ""Democrats are already talking about how they are doing better in the early voting than they thought they would."" 4. Most expensive race so far: The contest has seen an outsized level of third-party spending, making it the most expensive race this election cycle, even more than last year's Senate special election in Massachusetts to replace former Sen. John Kerry. Outside spending also tops the current Senate race in Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is defending his seat. In addition to the $2.4 million spent by the campaigns themselves, as of mid-February nearly $9 million had been spent by outside groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors outside spending. Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the CRP, said the influx of cash has to do with the start of the 2014 midterms. ""It seems like an anomaly that there would be all this outside interest when it's going to have to be fought again in November,"" she said. But she added that groups are interested in this race in part because there's ""no other show in town yet."" Outside money, she said, can significantly strengthen or weaken the eventual victor when the race plays out again in November, but it also plays a large role in determining the dialogue and themes in the contest. Breaking the numbers down, Jolly appears to have an advantage in third-party spending. About $623,000 has been spent in efforts to oppose Sink, and Jolly has benefited from about $600,000 more to support him than his opponent. American Crossroads, the conservative super-PAC backed by Karl Rove, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are two of the largest super-PACs that have backed Jolly. On the Democratic side, House Majority PAC put in nearly $1 million. The two campaign arms in the House dished out the most cash in the race -- the National Republican Congressional Committee slightly outspent the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, $2.2 million to $2.1 million. 5. From Barker to Biden to Bowzer to Bubba: Beside the national money and attention, the race also landed some big-time surrogates. Vice President Joe Biden flew in to headline a fundraiser for Sink, and former President Bill Clinton recorded an automated call for the Democratic candidate. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a rock star among grassroots conservatives, recorded a robocall for Jolly, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush starred in pro-Jolly TV commercial. But it wasn't just politicians. Bob Barker, the longtime host of ""Price is Right,"" starred in an ad for Jolly in December. And in another blast from the past, Jon ""Bowzer"" Bauman from Sha-Na-Na fame campaigned for Sink.

"(CNN) -- Dubai's most impressive buildings are looking a little psychedelic this week. In the Dubai Mall atrium, a chandelier made from steel cables dangles from the ceiling, emitting the type of strobe lighting more readily associated with disco balls. Illuminated beams pour out from the pinnacle of the Burj Khalifa, making the world's tallest building resemble a giant lighthouse. In Burj Lake, home of the Dubai Fountain -- the world's largest water feature -- a hyper-realistic 3D hologram of a whale frolics in above the water. The Souk al Bahar -- a grand, Arabian-style bazaar -- has been transformed into a Disney-esque 3D cinematic feat; . French stage director and composer Damien Fontaine has used video mapping and LED projectors to create a visual narrative in which two characters go in search of hidden treasure. This collection of more than 30 installations is part of Dubai's inaugural Festival of Lights, a 10-day event modeled on the version hosted every December in Lyon, France. In fact, the city of Lyon co-sponsored the event, along with Emaar Properties, the Dubai developers responsible for many of Dubai' most ambitious projects. ""We aimed to mark an extraordinary celebration of artistic creativity and light installations on a scale never experienced before in the region,"" said an Emaar spokesperson. In addition to borrowing the concept, Emaar has also tapped the talent pool of artists, designers and architects that each year turn Lyon into an electric playground. Participants include Moroccan-born fashion designer JC/DC (aka, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac), who once designed a teddy bear coat for Madonna and French lingerie designer Chantal Thomass. ""The City of Lyon has set a global benchmark in festive lighting and it was an ideal fit to partner with them to bring the world's finest lighting concepts to Dubai,"" says Emaar's spokesperson. The Lyon festival started out as a religious tradition, but has since evolved to become one of the most impressive entries on the global arts calendar. Set over four days, artists have been known to project flames onto churches, create animations to crawl up buildings, and graft holograms onto mist. The event attracts millions of visitors every year. While Emaar has yet to release any numbers, they noted the festival was ""well received.""","This week Dubai hosted its inaugural Festival of Lights .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The late Academy Award-winning composer Maurice Jarre enjoyed a glittering career composing the scores to many classic films. French composer Maurice Jarre wrote scores for films by Hollywood legends like John Huston, Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean. Last month, the 84 year-old who died Sunday gave one of his final interviews to CNN's The Screening Room, in conversation with fellow composer Alexandre Desplat. Jarre, who died of cancer, worked with many  legendary directors, like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston. But it is the French composer's work with British director David Lean -- the scores to ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Dr Zhivago,"" and ""A Passage to India,"" for which he won three Oscars --  for which he is best remembered. Twice Oscar-nominated French composer Alexandre Desplat, who has written the scores for Stephen Frears' 2006 drama ""The Queen,"" and last year's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" regarded Jarre as an inspiration and an influence. ""Maurice was an immense artist; an incredible symphonist; a magician of the melody and a benevolent human being,"" Desplat told CNN in tribute to Jarre who he describes as the greatest composer of the last 50 years. Alexandre Desplat: I don't know if you know, but the path that you traced for us French composers is phenomenal and indispensable. And, of course, love for cinema and theater is something that unites us, because I also wrote a lot for the theater like yourself. Maurice Jarre: The love for cinema, that's correct. I also had the opportunity to work with real -- to use a common word -- 'giants.' Volker SchlÃ¶ndorff , Visconti, John Huston ... AD: and Hitchcock! MJ: Hitchcock. This type of director has disappeared. They no longer exist. AD: One can sense with your work this passion for cinema, and for images -- your complete dedication to images. I think I also have this devotion, in fact, I don't think, I know, because it's devoured me since I was an adolescent. There are many composers of whom I know that are film composers by default, simply because it's a job; it's a good occupation. I don't sense in them that love for images, and that inspiration films has given us. MJ: People who say to me, 'When you write the music for a film do you know whether the film will be a great success?' I tell them, 'No, I was mainly concerned about finishing the music in time.' Sam Spiegel (producer of ""Lawrence of Arabia) once said, 'You have a job like Superman!' That was true because I worked day and night. But, at that point, I had no idea I was working on probably one of the best films in the history of cinema. What is your favorite Maurice Jarre movie score? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . AD: This dedication to the cinema is all-encompassing. When one is a composer for films, it's day and night. One needs to be in great physical condition! MJ: Oh yes! [Jarre puts up fists, as though in a boxing match] Like an athlete... AD: I know that like me you must have worked 18 to 20 hours a day because there was no choice. Unless we are directing other people, having people work for us. In this case you'd probably have to do less. But as we're, I think, somewhat intelligent, and in love with details and in love with the timbre of the orchestration. MJ: That's why I was so disappointed that you lost the Oscar [Desplat was nominated for Best Score in 2006 for Stephen Frears' ""The Queen.""] The award is not that important, but it has sentimental value for you, because I respect your work. AD: I hope to one day achieve three Oscars like yourself Maurice. But you have to keep in mind that the rewards for the work are secondary. MJ: I was very disappointed with the people who won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Composition last year. For me, it should represent the real best film scores outside of, let's say, political factors. Watch video: 'Zhivago' composer dies . AD: What's essential is to have extremely talented directors who listen to you. That's the best reward, because your talent as a composer can express itself. You can search, you can invent something. With films where the directors aren't so great, it's much more difficult to write good music. MJ: You know, before I wrote the first electronic score for Peter Weir, for ""Year of Living Dangerously,"" nobody wanted to hear about a purely electronic score, but Peter Weir used it in an artistic manner. That's what was so great. AD: That is, for me, an example because after having done 70 or 80 film scores, I realize it is perhaps time for me to be careful not to repeat myself, and to find a new voice. I think that the path you took in the 1980s ... I find it extremely courageous to abandon the orchestra for electronic music. For me, it's an incredible example. What was for you, Maurice, the most beautiful experience, or the Oscar which you loved most? MJ: Of course, it's the first [for ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in 1963]. It's a sentimental one, because David Lean and I became good friends. With the good directors it was always an interesting experience -- and a difficult one -- because we always had slightly different visions at the outset. But, it always arranged itself. I never really had a 'bust-up' with a good director. A good director will always find an intellectual understanding. And that's what was great - I had an opportunity with all these people. I don't think I can say that I ever worked with a bad director. There were never any real problems; there were discussions ... a bit of diplomacy here and there.","Oscar-winning composer, Maurice Jarre wrote score for ""Lawrence of Arabia""

"(CNN) -- A Florida police sergeant was fired for possessing several so-called Trayvon Martin shooting targets, authorities said Saturday. Sgt. Ron King of Port Canaveral Police Department was fired Friday after an internal review investigated how he offered the hoodie paper shooting targets to two fellow officers, said John Walsh, interim CEO of the Canaveral Port Authority. The officers, who saw King with the targets in his police vehicle, declined the offer, Walsh said. ""Port Canaveral Police Department considers that behavior unacceptable,"" Walsh said of King's conduct. King couldn't be immediately reached for comment. In February 2012, Martin, 17, was shot and killed in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain who is awaiting trial on a second-degree murder charge in Martin's death. Zimmerman's lawyer worries brother's tweets could hurt defense . Martin family attorney Ben Crump condemned the use of the targets. ""It is absolutely reprehensible that a high-ranking member of the Port Canaveral Police, sworn to protect and serve Floridians, would use the image of a dead child as target practice,"" Crump said in a statement. ""Such a deliberate and depraved indifference to this grieving family is unacceptable."" Report: Martin's family settles with homeowners association . Walsh said the Canaveral Port Authority plans to apologize to the Martin family. King brought two of the targets to a firearms training session on April 4 at the Brevard Community College campus in Cocoa, Florida, CNN affiliate WFTV reported. King, who bought the targets on the Internet, and other officers at the training site were on duty at the time, the affiliate said. Port officials said King had been employed at the police department since January 2011, the affiliate said. Zimmerman's arrest 'solely to placate the masses,' mother writes on anniversary .

"(CNN) -- North Korea fired 30 short-range rockets into the sea off the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula early Saturday, a South Korean defense ministry official said. The rockets have an estimated range of 60 km (37 miles), according to the ministry. North Korean officials did not send out a navigational warning to ships before the apparent test, the official said. It marks the fourth known rocket test by Pyongyang this month. The country fired 25 short-range rockets into the water earlier this week. The launches have drawn criticism from South Korea and the United States as provocations by the North. The U.S. and South Korea have been conducting a joint annual military drill since February, and North Korea has said its missile tests are a justifiable defensive reaction to them.","The rockets have an estimated range of 37 miles, official says .

"(CNN) -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan dominated debates leading up to Sunday's local elections, even though he wasn't on the ballot. Even before results were announced, a triumphant Erdogan spoke to cheering supporters from the balcony of the headquarters of his ruling Justice and Development Party, calling the vote a victory for democracy in Turkey. Erdogan said he delivered an ""Ottoman slap"" to opponents at the polls. He compared his opponents to medieval assassins, and he vowed to pursue them. Even though Erdogan wasn't running for office, the closely watched municipal votes could show how much recent controversies and corruption probes are affecting support for him and his ruling party. CNN sister network CNN Turk reported that Erdogan's party had taken a strong early lead in the vote count, but opposition sources contest that. Is Turkey approaching a breaking point? Erdogan's government faces a corruption probe, waves of street protests have wracked the country for nearly a year, and the country's once-booming economy is slowing down. ""Despite all the undesired statements at rallies, today people will tell the truth and it will be beyond everything,"" Erdogan told journalists as he cast his vote earlier Sunday. ""People's words will be decisive rather than those who spoke at rallies. For me, people will make the final call, and we respect people's decision."" As authorities counted votes in the nationwide municipal elections Sunday, rival parties claimed victory in the races for mayor in Turkey's largest cities. The municipal vote is seen as a test of strength for Erdogan and the ruling Justice and Development Party, which has been in power since 2002. Erdogan, who took office in 2003, has been on the political defensive since December, when police detained dozens of people close to his government as part of a wide-ranging corruption probe. In subsequent weeks, the Prime Minister dismissed thousands of police commanders as well as the prosecutors leading the investigation. In early March, the death of a 15-year-old boy who had been hit in the head with a tear-gas canister during a demonstration last June sparked a new round of demonstrations. An Istanbul crowd chanted ""fascist government, Erdogan killer"" as Berkin Elvan's coffin was carried through the streets of his family's working-class Istanbul neighborhood. Erdogan fought back against critics who used social networks to attack him by vowing earlier this month to ""eradicate"" Twitter. The Twitter crackdown follows earlier threats by Erdogan to shut down Facebook and YouTube. Anonymous critics used the popular social networking sites to publish a series of audio recordings online that appear to be wiretaps of conversations of high-level officials, including Erdogan himself. The government has accused social media platforms of being used to spread false information and lies. The Prime Minister has called some recordings ""immorally edited material,"" including one in which a man who sounds like him purportedly instructs his son to hide tens of millions of dollars in cash from investigators. But he has also confirmed the authenticity of other wiretaps, including one in which he is heard telling the head of a major television news network to cut short the live broadcast of a rival politician's speech in parliament. ""The electoral campaigns have been tough,"" Turkish President Abdullah Gul said as he voted. ""But I want Turkish people to remember that our state is strong. State institutions are also strong. The problems we face will be resolved within a legal framework."" The leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, told reporters Sunday that he expected a ""good"" outcome. ""I have always told people, 'Listen to your conscience and vote accordingly.' I hope they will do that,"" Kilicdaroglu said. ""I am happy, I cast my vote. Democracy in Turkey should be strengthened. It should be renewed. We will build it from the start. I trust my people. I trust their judgment."" Brain drains while the heart stays: Is leaving Turkey an option? Turkish economic mess: How did it get to this point? CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Fionnuala Sweeney contributed to this report.","NEW: Turkey's Prime Minister calls the vote a victory for democracy .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts woman was found guilty Wednesday in the first-degree murder of her pregnant friend, whom she bludgeoned and strangled before cutting the baby from the victim's womb. Julie Corey, who was 35 at the time of the crime, was convicted in Worcester Superior Court in the 2009 slaying of Darlene Haynes, 23, in Worcester. Corey is to to be sentenced on Tuesday and faces a maximum sentence of life without parole, prosecutors said. As the verdict was read, Corey cried and placed her hands over her face. Haynes' body was found in her apartment on July 27, 2009. She was eight months pregnant at the time of her death. Days after the murder, Haynes' baby was found with Corey in New Hampshire. DNA evidence and a fingerprint on a bottle at the crime scene tied Corey to the killing, the district attorney's office said. According to trial testimony, Corey tried to pass the baby off as her own to family and friends, the statement said. The child now lives with her father, the statement said. ""It's probably the most horrific case this office has seen,"" Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said. ""This woman was killed for her baby."" Corey's lawyers argued that police failed to follow up on leads, including Haynes' ex-boyfriend. They suggested that the ex-boyfriend had given the baby to Corey and her former boyfriend, Alex Dion, according to CNN affiliate WCVB. Dion denied this in court testimony. Calls to Corey's attorney were not returned. At the time, Worcester police said Haynes told people she gave birth at an undisclosed Massachusetts hospital. ""When the woman (Corey) appeared with the newborn baby girl in Worcester ... the suspicions of a number of this woman's acquaintances were piqued,"" police said. ""In the aftermath of the discovery of Ms. Haynes' body and the information that her fetus was missing was reported in the media, several of these acquaintances advised detectives of their suspicions.""","Body of Darlene Haynes, 23, was found in her home in Worcester, Massachusetts .

"(CNN) -- A raging fire Saturday at a hotel in the Saudi Arabian city of Medina killed 15 people and injured another 130, state news reported. According to the official Saudi Press Agency, the local government issued a statement saying it first learned about the fire shortly after 2:30 p.m. (6:30 a.m. ET) Saturday. It was under control by 5 p.m. By then, authorities were already sifting through the damage and trying to determine how the blaze began. The hotel had more than 700 guests from numerous nations when the fire erupted. As one of the holiest cities in the Islamic world, Medina is frequently visited by religious pilgrims.

"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (CNN) -- On the outskirts of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in the dusty crowded neighborhood of Akaki, I've just been treated to a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony. The beans are roasted and the coffee boiled in front of you then served piping hot with a heaping spoonful of sugar and a side of freshly popped corn. As I step out onto the dirt road to leave, one of my hosts wants to ask a question: do I know anyone who can donate some wheelchairs, so adults don't' have to carry disabled children on their backs to school anymore? I wish I did. The woman who needs the wheelchairs is one of the 20,000 volunteers for Yekokeb Berhan, a USAID-funded program trying to help half a million highly vulnerable children. The name means ""Light from the Stars"" in Amharic, and is meant to reflect the resiliency of children. After spending a week working with the volunteers here, I have no doubt those wheelchairs are going to find their way, due to the resiliency of the adults. Read more: Ethiopia's rock churches 'built by angels' Yekokeb Berhan volunteers are chosen by community committees and given training in health, parenting, budgeting and life skills. Then they go out into communities, to find and identify the most vulnerable children. Each volunteer will take in 25 of those kids as her own. ""I have 29 children"" says Sintayehu Kenna, a mother of four (plus 25), ""I can't separate them from my own. I love them. "" The program's philosophy is that the way to help children is to help their families. More often than not, assistance is needed in multiple areas -- and that means these volunteers have had to become master networkers -- calling on friends, family, neighbors, local businessmen and faith leaders to get the kids what they need. Leyela Ayele, from the Kolfe neighborhood, tells me about a family of eight in which the father was sick and the mother was the breadwinner until she had a heart attack and died. Ayele volunteered to foster the six kids. One of the boys was malnourished and Ayele went to every health center in the area, telling doctors about him, until she found one to admit and treat him. She visited the local bakery and convinced the owner to provide breakfasts for another child. And she linked up the eldest with a government association that gave a scholarship to study hairdressing. Volunteers receive a stipend of about $10 a month to cover phone and transportation costs. They are expected to give about 15-20 hours a week, but I found they all are giving much, much more. Alemitu Yemes has 31 kids, four of her own, two foster kids plus her 25 kids from the program. She's given a small room in her compound, rent free, to a family of five. Everyone except the youngest toddler is HIV positive. Yemes is working to keep the kids in school and making sure the family keeps to their anti-viral medical regime. ""We don't want them to be dependent,"" she says, ""I'm telling them to be self-reliant and we are all working towards that together."" Yekokeb Berhan is also working in conjunction with local government and 40 civil society organizations to recruit, train and supervise the volunteers all over the country. In Ethiopia, formal education doesn't begin until age seven. So, the Hiwot Integrated Development Association (HIDA) struck a deal with the local government. HIDA would renovate and supply an early childhood development center if the government would pay the teachers. That partnership resulted in new brightly colored classroom expanded to serve 128 children, many of them considered highly vulnerable. Amharic and English are taught, and on the day I visited, I was treated to a version of the nursery rhyme Mary Had a Little Lamb. But the backbone of the Yekokeb Berhan program is the individual volunteers. A majority of the women I met were single mothers with big families of their own. Some work as bread makers and vegetable sellers, but about half of those I spoke with seemed to have no other support. But yet everyone I met said it was their moral obligation to help others. ""Even after they turn 18 years we will still help them, by linking them up with the woreda (local government) and getting them skill training and jobs. We will empower our graduated children,"" says Gete Tefera, who has two children of her own, plus her 25 fosters. Read more: War orphans turn tragedy into triumph . On my last day in Addis, I met with a group of women entrepreneurs in a half-built concrete mid-rise with broken windows, which will one day be a youth center. Through Yekokeb Berhan's ""Community Self-Help Savings Group"" each is getting help with a new venture and for the first time in their lives, saving money. The women enthusiastically describe their plans: one is switching from selling bananas to housewares, because the latter doesn't spoil; another is expanding her business from selling used clothes to new. But the profits will not be all theirs. As part of the program, two birr a week, about 10 cents, has got to go into a kitty to help out those in need. Before I leave, one woman says there are a lot of kids in the neighborhood unable to go to school because of poor eyesight. She wants to know if I know anyone who can get them the glasses they need. I don't. But I'm going to look into it. Find out more about Yekokeb Berhan.","Ethiopian group is helping highly vulnerable children .

"(CNN) -- Beyonce and her mother Tina Knowles talk to CNN's Becky Anderson during London Fashion Week about the launch of their fashion label, House of Dereon, and Beyonce's pregnancy. Beyonce: I grew up in a fabric store. Unfortunately my mother would say: ""Come on let's go to the fabric store,"" and she would make all of these beautiful clothes for myself and the other ladies of Destiny's Child, and after so many years my fans said we want to buy these clothes somewhere, so it was a natural thing for us to do this line, and it's so great for us to be able to do it together, number one because we get to spend time together, and two because we have such respect for each others' taste. Becky: Tina what is it like to see not just your daughter but your designs on television? Watch the interview with Beyonce and Tina Knowles . Tina Knowles: Oh it's unbelievable sometimes and I never anticipated that. I started designing things out of necessity because there were budgetary restraints. So I would buy fabrics instead of clothes and just make them. Beyonce: Back in those days they wouldn't loan us the clothes. Tina: And it's funny when you need the clothes they won't loan them to you, and when you don't need them everyone wants to give them to you, so that's how it started but that was very exciting to see the clothes on TV. Becky: How do you get on with each other? Do you fall out over design? Beyonce: Sometimes, but it's very rare. I think we will get into it and it's usually over the phone, not in person and then we'll hang up and call each other and say you're right. You're right but we have such similar taste, but there's respect. I respect my mother so much and she respects my taste as well so we have a lot of trust. Becky: Many fans will call it ""Beyonce style"" -- where do you get the inspiration? Beyonce: This collection was inspired by a lot of my travels. I did a world tour, I traveled to Asia, Brazil, all over the world and I saw such beauty and my mother traveled with me and we decided we should mix these great cultures together and make something original and beautiful, and this show celebrates the global nomad, and one day at the rate we're going which is such a beautiful thing, there won't be all these different races we'll all just be mixed up and beautiful and that is so wonderful exciting and refreshing you know we have the mixtures of the African hair wraps and some of the Asian prints and we mix it with different textures sequins and gold jewelery and it just becomes very refreshing. Becky: Miss Tina, is there any one piece that comes to mind that you think that is the inspiration? Tina: I think the holiday collection -- what Beyonce is wearing now. We were inspired by her travels and we did a lot of different prints, sequins, glitz and glamor and we mixed it with some funky things. Becky: Congratulations on the pregnancy. Does the collection now include maternity wear -- everybody will be asking that question? Beyonce: What I'm wearing today is part of the collection and its not supposed to be, but it actually is really good for the maternity but we didn't plan six months ago before - actually longer than that - but we do have some things that I am still trying to rock. Becky: Are you struggling to find things that you feel good in where your husband might go err, I'm not having that? Beyonce: Actually I am having so much fun, it has been the most fun time now that it has been announced and I don't have to, you know, it was really difficult to conceal, but now that I can be proud and excited about it I'm having so much fun shopping -- it's great. Becky to Tina: You must be delighted . Tina: I am so delighted. I'm over the moon. Becky: Do you know what you're having? Beyonce: I don't. Becky: And if you did you wouldn't tell me! Do you consider this more fashion than style and the idea being you're sort of universal, you are for the universal woman -- who is the House of Dereon woman? Tina: I think trend-setting woman, confident, has her own style. Beyonce: Yes someone bold, someone who wants to stand out, someone confident, hard working and I think it is more about style than fashion -- it's a lifestyle and we just want to bring out that inner confidence and inner beauty in every woman. Becky: And has your attitude towards style, fashion changed since you learned you were pregnant? Beyonce: I just feel like it is often within. My mother has always told me that beauty comes from within and what's exciting about being a woman is you can say today I feel like being, today I feel really conservative, today I'm feeling classy, today I am going on a date and I want to just be a showstopper and you know there is this variety of beautiful clothes that can bring out whatever you feel inside but it comes from here and you should wear your clothes they shouldn't wear you. Becky: So it doesn't come from Jay-Z -- that's what you're saying? Beyonce: It comes from here.","Beyonce says sometimes she falls out with her mother Tina over clothes design, but it's rare .

"(CNN) -- Get ready for some McBashing. The hamburger appears to be overtaking the filled baguette as France's convenience food of choice. Burgers now make up just more than 45% of all sandwiches sold in France, according to research from the French consulting firm Gira Conseil cited by the Telegraph. The research cites 2013 burger sales, which rose from a mere one in nine in 2000. Moreover, three-quarters of traditional French restaurants now list ""le burger"" on their menus; in many cases burgers outsell more traditional meals such as steak frites. Consumption of the baguette itself, dispensed from countless corner boulangeries, also appears to be declining. It's the portable variety filled with jambon, fromage and other items, however, that's really beleaguered, figures show. On top of that, France is McDonald's second largest market, after the United States. In 2012, French fast food sales accounted for 54% of the restaurant market, outstripping traditional sit-down restaurant meals for the first time. The 'long burger lunch' The news isn't all bad news for French cuisine. The French do hamburgers differently -- with a more refined, gourmet touch -- according to a Paris correspondent for the Telegraph. Indeed, if you believe Natasha Edwards, resident in the capital for 20 years, le (gourmet) burger might almost find its place at a legendary three-hour French lunch, alongside a bottle or two of Bordeaux. The burgers ""young Parisian hipsters"" are ordering are nothing like mass-produced McDonald's fare, Edwards reports. She cites an â¬11.40 ($15.50) offering from the Paris New York hamburger restaurant (50 rue du Fauburg St-Denis; +33 1 47 70 15 24) made from rare-breed beef but using lesser cuts to keep the price down. A search reveals other offerings, such as Big Fernand's (55 Rue du Faubourg PoissonniÃ¨re; +33 1 73 70 51 52) 3,840 hamburger combinations with a choice of Charolais or Normandy beef, among other meats -- including veal -- for an average of around $18. Elsewhere, fillings in the five burgers at La Maison MÃ¨re's (French site only; 4 Rue de Navarin; +33 01 42 81 11 00) cost up to about $27 and include breaded cod and Black Angus steak (the ""Black Label""). ""Parisians have officially gone burger bonkers,"" as Time Out puts it. Shorter lunch breaks (from a luxurious hour and a half in 1975 to a rushed 30 minutes more commonly today, according to the Telegraph) appear to be one prosaic reason, but Edwards also cites ""the eternal French fascination with Americana.""","Burgers make up close to half of sandwiches sold in France .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and fiancee Kate Middleton made their first official engagement as a couple Thursday, launching a lifeboat in Wales. The pair, who are due to marry in April, officially named the ""Hereford Endeavour"" lifeboat in a ceremony at the Trearddur Bay Lifeboat Station in Anglesey, North Wales.  Middleton, wearing a Vivien Sheriff black-feathered beret, three-quarter length cream coat and suede boots, poured a bottle of champagne over the lifeboat after Prince William made a speech commending the efforts of the volunteers and rescue crew. ""We effectively have two launches today,"" said CNN royal contributor Mark Saunders. ""The launch of the lifeboat by William and Catherine and, at the same time, the launch of William and Catherine into this celebrity saturated world they are going to be living in."" Despite the modest nature of the event, hundreds of people turned out to watch the royal couple conduct their first official duty together. ""In 20 years of royal reporting I've never witnessed quite such excitement for such a single job,"" said Saunders. One onlooker told CNN: ""It's lovely... I would have thought more people would have brought flowers and things for them but it's lovely... It's low key which is what he (Prince William) wanted."" It's the first public appearance the couple has made since they announced their engagement last November. ""It's a very low-key event, launching a lifeboat on the island where they both live...it's a very good debut event for them,"" said Saunders. ""They have a very good relationship with the locals here, they are often seen at the local supermarket and buying wine from the local off-license. So for a first event, they couldn't have picked a better one."" The reason for such a low-key ceremony, says Saunders, is to prepare Middleton for life as a royal. ""(The royal family) have learnt many lessons from when Princess Diana first joined the royal family. ""Diana was just thrown in the deep end and absolutely given no guidance whatsoever. They're making sure this time round Catherine is well prepared,"" he said. After naming the new Atlantic 85 lifeboat, Prince William and Middleton met members of the charity's lifeboat crew along with fundraising volunteers and were given a demonstration of the vessel's capabilities. In a statement issued before the ceremony, Lifeboat's Operations Manager, Aubrey Diggle said: ""It's an honor to have Prince William and Miss Middleton at our naming ceremony. ""Naming a new lifeboat is always a special occasion for the charity where we can thank our supporters and fundraisers. Having the royal couple there will make the day even more memorable for the whole community.""

"(CNN) -- In the 1980s, Jane Fonda was the face of fitness for millions of Americans. ""The Jane Fonda Workout"" became the highest-selling home video ever, with more than a million copies purchased. Since then, Fonda has produced and starred in over 20 home exercise tapes and DVDs. After a 15-year hiatus, the Oscar award-winning actress returned to the fitness field with the goal of helping baby boomers feel better and stay active. Her latest DVD, ""Prime Time: AM/PM Yoga for Beginners,"" releases Tuesday. Fonda turns 75 later this month. We spoke with her Monday about aging, eating and living life abundantly. Q: When you released your first workout tape in 1982, did you have a sense of how big a phenomenon you were on to? I did not have a clue. I had no idea. It was pure luck. I didn't realize the role timing would play in the whole thing. There was no video industry. I didn't know anyone who owned a video, because no one could afford the hardware to play a video. And there was no video that beckoned people to do it over and over and over again until that tape came out. That's what caused the video industry to explode ... it was all very synergistic ... it had no strategic thought on my part. Q: How do you stay motivated? What motivates me is how good I feel afterwards. (Laughs) I don't wake up saying ""Oh goody, I am going to work out."" But I do it because of how it makes me feel when it's over. I feel so good. If I've felt depressed or down at all, it picks me up and makes me feel great. Q: Do you feel you have to do as much as you did 10 years ago? Absolutely not, no. I can't do what I used to do. My body just wouldn't tolerate what I used to do. (Fonda has had hip and knee replacement surgeries.) The mistake that so many people make is that if they can't do what they once did, then they don't do anything. Big mistake. It's important just to do something. If you can't run, walk. ... If you can't lift heavy weights, so lift light weights. But just keep yourself physically active. It makes all the difference not just for your body, but for your brain as well. Q: What do you eat? I eat fish, chicken and eggs. I eat red meat maybe twice a week. But when you are older, it is very important what you eat because your cells regenerate more slowly and also you put on weight more easily because you have less muscle than you used to, so every single calorie you put in your body has to count for something. I eat by color. I try to eat something dark green, dark purple, red, orange, yellow, white, because they all have different vitamins and minerals in them. Q: What foods do you avoid at all costs? Well, I am not a purist. I am not perfect. Now that the Christmas holiday is coming, I will take a bite of a pecan pie, but I won't eat a whole pecan pie. I will take a few bites of the dressing, but I will eat a lot of the turkey. Turkey meat is so good. I will eat it with cranberry sauce and gravy. But I try to eat less of the very fattening food and more of the really healthy food. Q: What do you think is the secret to a well-lived life? I think it's more important to be ""interested"" than to try to be ""interesting."" I've always remained interested and curious and I've always been a student as well as a teacher, so I think that's key. Also being intentional ... living an intentional life ... thinking about who you are, how you affect other people, how you are perceived in the world and how you can change that to be more positive -- instead of sort of just drifting along like a leaf in the river, being really intentional about how you live. When you do yoga, you can do the poses thinking about the grocery shopping or what you are going to do tomorrow, or you can be intentional ... in the moment, being present in what you are doing. That's how to get the most out of life and learning. That has been very important to me.","Jane Fonda has produced and starred in more than 20 exercise tapes and DVDs .

"(CNN) -- African-American poet Maya Angelou once wrote: ""Africa is a historical truth ... no man can know where he's going unless he knows exactly where he's been and exactly how he arrived at his present place."" This search for"" historical truth"" has led thousands of visitors to Cape Coast, in Ghana, a picturesque seaside town with stunning blue sea, serene beaches and pastel-colored fishing boats. Instead of idyllic days under the sun, they are looking for a glimpse into their dark ancestral past -- the harrowing experience of their African forebears who were sold as slaves. Roots tourism has brought more and more people of African descent, like Monique Ross and Jacques Wallace, to the sleepy fishing port. Ross, Wallace and their tour group from New York walk the grounds of Cape Coast Castle, a seaside fortress that served as slave dungeons, to see what their ancestors went through before they were shipped across the Atlantic. ""I'm slightly numb actually,"" said Wallace. ""I wasn't actually ready for the stories about this place as far as the way people were treated, and the thing about the tunnel and everyone bound and being led down the tunnel is a little bit tragic, a little bit too much to take in all at once."" His fellow traveler agreed. ""It is a little devastating at first,"" said Ross. ""It's good to know the history of what has happened and how to connect your historical past with things that have happened."" Read more: Ghana finds its voice through independence . U.S. President Barack Obama his family made a stop at Cape Coast Castle when he visited Ghana in July 2009. It was an emotional pilgrimage for them, especially because First Lady Michelle Obama and her mother are descendants of slaves from South Carolina. Crumbling colonial buildings are a reminder that Cape Coast was once European colonial capital that changed hands between the Portuguese, the Dutch, the Swedish, the Danish and the British through centuries. The largest slave trade outpost . It flourished as the largest slave-trading outpost in West Africa when the opening of European plantations in the Americas in the 1500s drove the demand for slaves, eclipsing the gold trade. For more than three centuries, millions of captured Africans -- men, women and children -- arrived from different parts of the continent and were herded like cattle onto ships destined to the United States, South America and the Caribbean. Kwesi Essel Blankson, a senior educator at Cape Coast Castle who gave Obama and his family a guided tour, describes the inhumane conditions the slaves had to endure in the fortress. They were crammed into a small space, living on little food, water and air, even defecating side by side, often for months. Female captives were subjected to rape and sexual abuse by guards and officials. Those who survived the harrowing conditions had to go through the so-called ""Door of No Return"" -- an arched gateway with a pair of thick doors that would shut behind the captured men, women and children before they were forced onto the slave ships. ""For many, this door represents... a journey from the known to the unknown,"" says Blankson. ""And therefore right from here, their resistance was much anticipated."" While many travelers use Cape Coast as a base to explore Ghana's other tourist spots, like Kakum National Park, the city hopes roots tourism, with the castle as a focus, could bring in more visitors to spend longer time there. And perhaps the dark chapter of history tells not only a story of misery but also that of survival. Asked how Obama reacted during the visit, Blankson says the president was ""surprised, shocked and sad -- and also motivated ... because if blacks survived through this, then it is a survival of human beings. It shows that we have a high survival instinct."" See also: Ghana: Keeping one of Africa's stars of democracy shining . See also: Bamboo bikes turn around fortunes for working women in Ghana .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States is replacing its much-mocked system of color-coded terrorism alerts with detailed advisories about specific threats, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced Thursday. ""When we have information about a specific, credible threat, we will issue a formal alert providing as much information as we can,"" Napolitano said. That information will include a summary of the threat, steps authorities are taking to guard the public and what the public can do, she said. ""The alerts will be specific to the threat. They may recommend certain actions or suggest looking for specific suspicious behavior. And they will have a specified end date,"" Napolitano said in a speech at George Washington University. Napolitano's formal announcement confirmed reports that emerged Wednesday. The new system, set to take effect in late April, replaces the five-color system established after al Qaeda's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Napolitano said those warnings were ""too often accompanied by little practical information."" The new system, she said, is built on the idea ""that we are all in this together, and that we all have a role to play."" The five-color system has rarely changed from its middle setting of yellow, or ""elevated,"" for the general public and orange, or ""high,"" for commercial aviation. It has not been lowered below those levels since its establishment in 2002. The system was the butt of jokes and parodies almost from the start, and polls found that the public considered it confusing. Kate Hanni, of the airline travelers' advocacy group FlyersRights.org, called it ""very useless."" ""People just ignored it,"" Hanni told CNN on Wednesday. Since the color rarely changed, passengers came to believe it didn't mean anything, she said. In addition, some critics accused the Bush administration of manipulating the system to gin up fear at politically sensitive times. Just days after he announced his resignation in 2005, then-Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge told a Washington forum that he sometimes disagreed with the rationale for raising the alert but was overruled by others on the administration's Homeland Security Advisory Council, which made the decisions. The Bush administration denied Ridge's assertions. Napolitano said the new system ""is built on a clear and simple premise: When a threat develops that could impact you -- the public -- we will tell you."" The alerts will distinguish between ""elevated"" and ""imminent"" threats and could be limited to warnings for specific industries or police or communicated more broadly to the public, she said. The yellow alert was raised to orange five times for the nation as a whole and three times for specific industries. The orange alert for aviation was raised to red once, in August 2006, and only for flights from Britain to the United States. The alert followed the announcement by British authorities that they had disrupted a major plot to blow up jetliners, and it was lowered back to orange six days later.","""Specific, credible threats"" will be outlined to the public, Napolitano says .

"Lynchburg, Virginia (CNN) -- Railroad workers in Virginia began trying to pull wrecked tank cars out of the James River Thursday as safety officials began trying to figure out why a train full of crude oil jumped the tracks and caught fire in the heart of Lynchburg. Thirteen of the 105 cars derailed Wednesday afternoon, and three of those ended up in the James River where it winds past downtown Lynchburg, National Transportation Safety Board investigator Jim Southworth told reporters. The train was made up entirely of tank cars full of crude, and about 50,000 gallons of it were unaccounted for after the crash, authorities said Wednesday night. There were no injuries in the derailment, but the resulting fire sent a pillar of black smoke rising over the city of about 78,000 people and forced the evacuation of much of its downtown for several hours. Most of the oil that spilled from the train cars appears to have either burned off or has been contained, said William Hayden of the state Department of Environmental Quality. There is an oil sheen on the river that stretches for about nine miles, and department personnel are testing water samples, he said. ""We do expect that much of the oil that remains will be broken up by the fast-moving water of the James,"" Hayden said. Southworth said investigators were just getting to work and began interviewing the crew Thursday afternoon. In addition, the condition of the track and its bed after heavy rains will be one of the things they will examine, said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway. Lynchburg municipal spokeswoman JoAnn Martin said worker were expecting to finish hauling the cars out of the river Thursday night. Parts of the railbed underneath the tracks had collapsed in the derailment and the remaining track was twisted, but Southworth cautioned that investigators may not release any conclusions for more than a year. ""This will be a well-orchestrated industrial ballet,"" he said. The amount of oil shipped by rail has increased fourfold since 2005 amid a drilling boom in North Dakota and Canada. Those shipments have been under scrutiny since the derailment and fire that killed 47 people in a small town in Quebec last July, and environmentalists warned against having trains haul oil through downtown Lynchburg in March. Some of the cars on the train were of a model that the NTSB has said has a high incidence of leaking during crashes. But Southworth said investigators don't know whether any of the cars that derailed Wednesday were among them. The Association of American Railroads estimates that more than 90,000 of those cars are used to carry hazardous materials. About 14,000 of them have been built to the latest safety standards, the association says. CNN Correspondent Athena Jones reported from Lynchburg; Matt Smith reported and wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: An oil sheen stretches for about nine miles on the James River, an official says .

"(CNN) -- As NASA prepares to hunt for Earth-like planets in our corner of the Milky Way galaxy, there's new buzz that ""Star Trek's"" vision of a universe full of life may not be that far-fetched. An artist's impression shows a planet passing in front of its parent star. Such events are called transits. Pointy-eared aliens traveling at light speed are staying firmly in science fiction, but scientists are offering fresh insights into the possible existence of inhabited worlds and intelligent civilizations in space. There may be 100 billion Earth-like planets in the Milky Way, or one for every sun-type star in the galaxy, said Alan Boss, an astronomer with the Carnegie Institution and author of the new book ""The Crowded Universe: The Search for Living Planets."" He made the prediction based on the number of ""super-Earths"" -- planets several times the mass of the Earth, but smaller than gas giants like Jupiter -- discovered so far circling stars outside the solar system. Boss said that if any of the billions of Earth-like worlds he believes exist in the Milky Way have liquid water, they are likely to be home to some type of life. ""Now that's not saying that they're all going to be crawling with intelligent human beings or even dinosaurs,"" he said. ""But I would suspect that the great majority of them at least will have some sort of primitive life, like bacteria or some of the multicellular creatures that populated our Earth for the first 3 billion years of its existence."" Putting a number on alien worlds . Other scientists are taking another approach: an analysis that suggests there could be hundreds, even thousands, of intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland constructed a computer model to create a synthetic galaxy with billions of stars and planets. They then studied how life evolved under various conditions in this virtual world, using a supercomputer to crunch the results. In a paper published recently in the International Journal of Astrobiology, the researchers concluded that based on what they saw, at least 361 intelligent civilizations have emerged in the Milky Way since its creation, and as many as 38,000 may have formed. Duncan Forgan, a doctoral candidate at the university who led the study, said he was surprised by the hardiness of life on these other worlds. ""The computer model takes into account what we refer to as resetting or extinction events. The classic example is the asteroid impact that may have wiped out the dinosaurs,"" Forgan said. ""I half-expected these events to disallow the rise of intelligence, and yet civilizations seemed to flourish."" Forgan readily admits the results are an educated guess at best, since there are still many unanswered questions about how life formed on Earth and only limited information about the 330 ""exoplanets"" -- those circling sun-like stars outside the solar system -- discovered so far. The first was confirmed in 1995 and the latest just this month when Europe's COROT space telescope spotted the smallest terrestrial exoplanet ever found. With a diameter less than twice the size of Earth, the planet orbits very close to its star and has temperatures up to 1,500Â° Celsius (more than 2,700Â° Fahrenheit), according to the European Space Agency. It may be rocky and covered in lava. Hunt for habitable planets . NASA is hoping to find much more habitable worlds with the help of the upcoming Kepler mission. The spacecraft, set to be launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida next week, will search for Earth-size planets in our part of the galaxy. Kepler contains a special telescope that will study 100,000 stars in the Cygnus-Lyra region of the Milky Way for more than three years. It will look for small dips in a star's brightness, which can mean an orbiting planet is passing in front of it -- an event called a transit. ""It's akin to measuring a flea as it creeps across the headlight of an automobile at night,"" said Kepler project manager James Fanson during a during a NASA news conference. The focus of the mission is finding planets in a star's habitable zone, an orbit that would ensure temperatures in which life could exist.  Watch a NASA scientist explain the search for habitable planets Â» . Boss, who serves on the Kepler Science Council, said scientists should know by 2013 -- the end of Kepler's mission -- whether life in the universe could be widespread. Finding intelligent life is a very different matter. For all the speculation about the possibility of other civilizations in the universe, the question remains: If the rise of life on Earth isn't unique and aliens are common, why haven't they shown up or contacted us? The contradiction was famously summed up by the physicist Enrico Fermi in 1950 in what became known as the Fermi paradox: ""Where is everybody?"" The answer may be the vastness of time and space, scientists explained. ""Civilizations come and go,"" Boss said. ""Chances are, if you do happen to find a planet which is going to have intelligent life, it's not going to be in [the same] phase of us. It may have formed a billion years ago, or maybe it's not going to form for another billion years."" Even if intelligent civilizations did exist at the same time, they probably would be be separated by tens of thousands of light years, Forgan said. If aliens have just switched on their transmitter to communicate, it could take us hundreds of centuries to receive their message, he added. As for interstellar travel, the huge distances virtually rule out any extraterrestrial visitors. iReport.com: Share your view of the universe . To illustrate, Boss said the fastest rockets available to us right now are those being used in NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto. Even going at that rate of speed, it would take 100,000 years to get from Earth to the closest star outside the solar system, he added. ""So when you think about that, maybe we shouldn't be worried about having interstellar air raids any time soon,"" Boss said.","Astronomer: There may be 100 billion Earth-like planets in the Milky Way .

"(CNN) -- Jordan's King Abdullah II, one of the first Arab leaders to call for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, told CNN the attack on Wednesday that killed members of al-Assad's inner circle is a ""tremendous blow to the regime."" But the king cautioned that he did not think the attack meant al-Assad's regime was about to crumble immediately. The explosion, which a rebel leader said was detonated by remote control, killed Defense Minister Dawood Rajiha; Deputy Defense Minister Assef Shawkat -- al-Assad's brother-in-law; and Hasan Turkmani, al-Assad's security adviser and assistant vice president, the state TV reports said. Interior Minister Ibrahim al-Shaar was injured in the blast, state television said, adding that he ""is in good health and that his condition is stable."" ""This was a tremendous blow to the regime but again, Damascus has shown its resilience, so I think maybe we need to keep this in perspective,"" Abdullah told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""Although this is a blow, I'm sure the regime will continue to show fortitude at least in the near future."" The king said the attack shows ""cracks"" in the regime, but his larger concern is the growing sectarian violence and whether it may lead to all-out civil war. Getting to know Syria's first family . He said the danger of civil war is increasing, and it is al-Assad's last chance to try to stop that from happening. ""If it breaks down, if civil order breaks down to the point of no return, it will take years to fix Syria. I have a feeling we're seeing the signs of that. The only people that can bring us back from that brink is the president and the regime. This is the last chance they have."" The king said the international community is continuing to pursue all options involving a political transition, but that recent events made him concerned about whether they could work. ""I think, as we continue to pursue the political option, the realities on the ground may have overtaken us,"" he said. ""Therefore I think the clock is ticking. I think we should continue to give politics its due, but if we haven't already passed that window, I think we're getting very close to a (civil war)."" Abdullah said he and other leaders are concerned about Syria's chemical weapons. ""One of the worst-case scenarios, as we are trying to look for political solutions, would be if some of those chemical stockpiles would fall into unfriendly hands,"" he said. What we need to know about Syria . Jordan's leader said that the big concern is whether the weapons could fall into the hands of groups like al Qaeda, which he said he believes is operating in parts of Syria. And he said not knowing who exactly is on which side complicates matters, including discussions of arming the rebels. Blitzer asked the king whether he thought it would be acceptable for al-Assad to flee to another country or if he wanted him to be tried for war crimes. ""If Bashar leaving the scene and exiting Syria brings a stop to the violence and creates a political transition -- that's a lesser of evils,"" he said. Abdullah said the international community must consider that, if al-Assad were to leave, questions would arise over who would replace him and how that might affect the restoration of order in Syria. ""It's not so much the individual, it's the system, and does the system allow for political transition?"" Abdullah said. ""And that's where I have my doubts."" Next for Syria: Showdown or stalemate?

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama touched on his recent announcement of support for same-sex marriage, saying at a New York City fundraising event Monday that he believes marriage equality ""strengthens families."" ""I want everyone treated fairly in this country. We have never gone wrong when we've extended rights and responsibilities to everybody,"" he said, drawing big applause. ""That doesn't weaken families, that strengthens families."" Obama highlighted some of his administration's work in recent years, including the passage of health care reform and the end of combat in Iraq. He also outlined goals he hopes to accomplish under a second term, including the repeal of the Defense Of Marriage Act, which the administration has already stopped defending. While he did not mention Republican rival Mitt Romney by name, he drew a sharp line of contrast between his own ideology and that of Republicans, promoting a theme of ""togetherness."" ""It's been said this election is going to be about values. I absolutely agree. It's about the economic values we have, about the values I believe will make America so special: Everybody gets a fair shot, everybody gets a fair share, everybody plays by the same set of rules,"" he said. The event, held at the Rubin Museum of Art in Manhattan, was hosted by singer Ricky Martin and was sponsored in part by the Futuro Fund, an initiative by some Latino leaders to support Obama's re-election bid. ""We admire his courage, like the courage he showed last week in affirming his belief in marriage equality,"" Martin, who announced two years ago that he is gay, said on stage, prior to introducing Obama. ""That is the kind of courage we expect from our president and that is why we support him."" Colorado legislature debates civil unions . Actress Eva Longoria was also seen in the crowd, according to pool news reports. Roughly 200 people were expected to attend the event, with tickets starting at $5,000. Obama's speech came hours after he delivered a commencement speech at Barnard College, underscoring his address to the all-female school with political undertones. ""After decades of slow, steady, extraordinary progress, you are now poised to make this the century where women shape not only their own destiny but the destiny of this nation and of this world,"" Obama said at the event in New York City. The president took the opportunity to highlight the Lilly Ledbetter Act, a fair-pay law passed under his first term in office, and slipped in themes from his re-election campaign, including his new motto ""forward."" ""We look forward, not back. And now that new doors have been opened for you, you've got an obligation to seize those opportunities,"" he said. Recent polls show Obama with a significant lead among women against Republican rival Mitt Romney. Republicans attribute the margin to what's become a Democratic-backed campaign to paint the GOP as leading a ""war on women."" While the president did not touch on his recent same-sex marriage endorsement in his Barnard speech, he nevertheless encouraged graduates to ""speak up for what's right."" ""The question is whether together we can muster the will -- in our own lives, in our common institutions, in our politics -- to bring about the changes we need,"" he said. ""And I believe that the women of this generation -- that all of you -- will help lead the way."" Also while in New York, Obama taped an appearance on the TV program ""The View,"" where he discussed his recent same-sex marriage endorsement. The segment will air Tuesday. Some White House officials have said that Obama initially intended to reveal his opinion on same-sex marriage during his appearance on ""The View"" this week, but Vice President Joe Biden's comments on a talk show last Sunday supporting same-sex marriage pushed the president to make an announcement sooner. Obama's commencement speech came just two days after Republican rival Mitt Romney gave a commencement address at the evangelical Liberty University in Virginia, where he made social issues a main theme of his remarks and touched on the marriage storyline. ""Culture matters. As fundamental as these principles are, they may become topics of democratic debate,"" Romney said. ""So it is today with the enduring institution of marriage. Marriage is a relationship between one man and one woman."" How the right helped launch same-sex marriage movement . Monday evening, the president was scheduled to stop at a fundraising dinner at a private residence with 60 people, hosted by Tony James of the Blackstone Group, an alternative asset management and financial services company. Tickets for that event cost $35,800. Proceeds from both the dinner and the earlier fundraiser will go to the Obama Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee for the president's re-election campaign, the Democratic National Committee and several state Democratic parties. While the full political implications of the president's same-sex marriage verdict remain to be seen, Gallup released a poll Friday showing 51% of Americans approve of Obama's support for gay couples to marry, while 45% disapprove. The survey was conducted entirely after he announced his endorsement in an ABC News interview on Wednesday. And a new Gallup poll out Monday gave further details into American attitudes on the topic. While 50% approve of same-sex marriage, a further breakdown of the numbers shows a significant gender gap: Fifty-six percent of women say couples of the same gender should be legally allowed to marry, while 42% of men feel the same way. The issue became prime political fodder over the weekend, with several high-profile Republicans pouncing on the president's remarks. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, son of Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, said he ""wasn't sure that (Obama's) views on marriage could get any gayer,"" sparking laughs on Friday among his audience at an event held by Iowa's Faith and Freedom Coalition. Meanwhile, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus also made headlines when he said Sunday that same-sex marriage was not a ""matter of civil rights."" ""I think it's just a matter of whether or not we're going to adhere to something that's been historical and religious and legal in this country for many, many years,"" Priebus said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""I mean, marriage has to have a definition, and we just happen to believe it's between a man and woman."" On Monday, Romney took the day off from the trail, but his campaign is still playing defense after Obama's campaign released a biting new ad attacking the former Massachusetts governor over his time at the private equity firm Bain Capital. The two-minute television spot -- to be released in major battleground states -- features former steelworkers talking about their job losses after Bain took over their company, GST Steel. Another steelworker in the ad compares Bain to a ""vampire."" ""They came in and sucked the life out of us,"" he said. ""It was like watching an old friend bleed to death."" The commercial re-establishes a major campaign hurdle Romney faced in the primary, when two of his former GOP rivals -- Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich -- accused Romney of being out of touch due to his lucrative tenure at Bain, which he helped found in 1984. Romney's campaign spokesman Andrea Saul responded to the ad Monday saying the campaign would ""welcome the Obama campaign's attempt to pivot back to jobs and a discussion of their failed record. Mitt Romney helped create more jobs in his private sector experience and more jobs as Governor of Massachusetts than President Obama has for the entire nation.""

"(CNN) -- One year ago, the Republican National Committee completed a four-month period of ""self-reflection"" and ""evaluation"" after losing its second straight presidential election and the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections. The result of that process became popularly known as the GOP ""Autopsy Report"" -- an analysis of all of the Republican Party's ailments and prescriptions for how to cure them. But, after a year, it doesn't look like they have really learned a thing. And their navel-gazing, introspection moment wasn't all that new or particularly self-aware, as more than a decade of RNC chairmen -- yes, they have all been men -- before Reince Priebus have all tried the same thing. Why the RNC built a year-round ground game . In 2003, Marc Racicot proclaimed that ""expanding our base by recruiting new Republican activists from traditionally strong and Democratic constituencies is our No. 1 priority."" Then, crickets. In 2005, Ken Mehlman's ""Conversations with the Community"" targeted African-Americans. That didn't go so well. And in 2009, Michael Steele's failed ""50 State Strategy"" spent a lot of money but did little else. Year after year, Republican leaders have admitted that their party is alienating huge swaths of voters. In last year's report, for nearly 100 pages, they tried to convey the message: ""We get it."" But here we are, another year later, and all the Republican Party has gotten is a year older, with little else to show for it. What the GOP has offered over the past 12 months to solve its problems is simply a change in tactics. The party hired ""outreach staff"" and placed them in communities they've never been in before. But one must question whether it is effective outreach when your agenda keeps alienating the very people you are trying to include. The party is conducting ""candidate trainings"" to teach them how to talk to (and about) women, hoping to stave off any more ""legitimate rape"" moments, among other things. It's worked to shorten the primary calendar and limit debates -- though ensuring that fewer people hear your agenda doesn't seem a good tactic to achieve your goals on expansion. The attempted change in tactics hasn't helped the party's leaders, officials, or endorsed candidates with their chronic foot-in-mouth syndrome. In this past year, we've heard Republican leaders and operatives call a female candidate an ""empty dress,"" talk about women's libidos, and -- once again -- try to downplay abuse. We've heard them use derogatory terms to describe Latino immigrants, comparing them to drug mules. They have used insulting stereotypes for African-Americans, including just last week when former vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan used thinly veiled language to talk about the ""culture"" of laziness among ""inner-city men."" And gay Americans have faced outright discrimination from Republicans at all levels -- from state party chairmen to candidates to elected officials. The Republican Party's failure to rebrand hasn't been limited to the disrespectful and insulting language. It continues to push an agenda that divides Americans, limits equally and denies to many the ""pursuit of happiness"" -- i.e., access to economic opportunity. In other words, the GOP's philosophy hasn't changed. The leaders may have set out to become a party that is more ""inclusive and welcoming,"" but in reality the GOP has moved in the opposite direction. It continues to alienate large communities of Americans, embracing a rhetoric that emphasizes fear of others and, ironically, entitlement for themselves. The biggest problem for the Republican Party has never been its primary calendar, its campaign tactics or a lack of trainings. The party's biggest problem is what it believes, what it says and how it governs. The good news is Democrats have spent the year building on a foundation of outreach rooted in our core values and an agenda based on equal opportunity. Democrats have pushed for equal pay for women because we know that when women succeed, America succeeds. We push for full equality for all Americans, regardless of where they live, what they look like or who they love. We push for commonsense immigration reform that is the right thing to do for our economy and our country. And we push an economic agenda that simply levels the playing field so that every American has a chance to move up the economic ladder. Democrats will use innovative programs and tools to empower grassroots supporters and ensure that Democrats up and down the ballot have the resources they need to win -- so that we can work to expand opportunity for all Americans.

"(CNN) -- One of the lesser-known things done by Spain's pre-Civil War left-wing government during its short rule was to legalize abortion. Banned under Franco, abortion was allowed again in 1985, and in 2010 legal abortion was extended radically by the left-wing Zapatero government. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Spaniards have taken to the streets to demand an end to Spain's laissez-faire abortion culture. The current conservative government is now promoting a bill which restricts -- albeit with significant compromises -- legal abortion. Among protests against the bill, topless activists called ""Femen"" threw bloodstained underwear at Madrid's Cardinal-Archbishop as he visited a Madrid parish. Contrasting view: Spain 'heading for self-made mess' with abortion ban . If, as predicted, the bill is passed, abortion will no longer be regarded in law as a ""right"" but as a crime. This classification is not a draconian throwback to a previous age: Today abortion remains part of the criminal law in many Western jurisdictions, even in places with high rates of legally-permitted abortion such as Britain. Two other elements of the proposed Spanish law which mirror the British abortion law relate to doctors: A requirement that two doctors are necessary to authorize an abortion in most cases, and a right of conscientious objection for those doctors who reject abortion. These three elements send a message that abortion is not merely a medical procedure but an act of grave moral significance for all involved: Doctors, mothers and unborn children. There is nothing in international human rights law which denies or downgrades a human being's right to life based on physical development. If we recognize that unborn children are human beings, then we must recognize that abortion is Spain's leading cause of death. Even advocates of legal abortion admit that unborn children are human beings. Those advocates, however, draw arbitrary lines on legal personhood and therefore the right to life: some at 12 weeks after conception, some at 24 weeks, some at birth and a few even years after birth. There is, however, no solid foundation for such lines. A human being has at the moment of conception the same genetic identity throughout life. This is why some pro-lifers like myself have reservations about the proposed law. The bill enshrines a compromise without a rational basis. Abortion would still be allowed when doctors diagnose a threat to the mother's health or when following an allegation that the baby was conceived in a non-consensual act. When a danger is detected to the mother's health, the correct way for doctors to proceed is to ""kill"" the danger, not kill the child. Abortion doesn't cure any illnesses or treat any conditions. Just as we don't kill children after birth if caring for them may involve a danger to the mother's health, we shouldn't kill them before birth either. When a woman has been made pregnant through rape, an abortion punishes an innocent person -- the child. It doesn't unrape the mother. Studies and surveys suggest that many, if not most, women made pregnant through sexual assault do not choose abortion and are glad they didn't. There is evidence, albeit not yet conclusive, which suggests that legal abortion may pose an additional health risk for women. A recent meta-analysis of 36 studies of Chinese women suggests a link between abortion and breast cancer. The research of New Zealand's Professor David Fergusson, who supports a legal right to abortion, suggests a significant link between abortion and negative mental health outcomes. Today Spain is an aging nation with one of the world's lowest birth-rates. Estimates suggest that in a few years deaths (of born people) will outnumber births. The Spanish cannot afford to continue to regard children as burdensome optional extras. In the United States, the Hispanic population continues to grow in size and significance. It is an absurd irony that Spain's native population has been declining just as their ethnic brethren have been advancing in the world's richest nation. Despite the new bill's compromises, I welcome its recognition of the equality of disabled human beings through the proposed deletion of disability as a ground for abortion. The revival of eugenics has been one of the most retrograde trends in recent decades, a sinister shadow of those dark pre-1945 years in which science was abused to justify eliminating so-called ""lives unworthy of life."" No unborn child is unworthy of legal protection against abortion: for we were all unborn children once. Read more: 2009 -- Spanish Parliament approves abortion bill .

"(CNN) -- A blaze that started as a controlled burn quickly got out of hand and turned into a fast-moving wildfire that destroyed at least 20 homes and killed at least one person in Oklahoma's Logan County on Sunday, authorities said. It was one of several fires to break out amid unseasonably high temperatures and windy conditions in the state. The victim was a 56-year-old man who failed to evacuate when requested, said Guthrie Fire Chief Eric Harlow. Guthrie is the county seat. The Guthrie blaze was about four miles long and up to a mile wide and was burning a largely rural area. Harlow put the fire's size at between 3,000 to 4,000 acres. ""It's growing so fast it's pretty hard to estimate,"" Stephens said. ""There are a lot of cedar trees, they have a lot of oil in them and they just explode."" The fire was the largest of several in the state that are being fueled by temperatures in the 90s and high winds, said Keli Cain, spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. ""They got three ingredients for a bad fire: high temperatures, high winds and low humidity,"" said Daryl Williams with the National Weather Service in Norman.","NEW: The fire began as a controlled burn .

"(CNN) -- Democratic offices in at least three states have reported instances of vandalism that party members say possibly were tied to Sunday's historic vote on health care reform. Early Monday morning, a glass panel at the Tucson office of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, was shattered, spokesman C.J. Karamargin said. It wasn't clear how the window was shattered, but visitors have to go through a gated courtyard to enter the office, and staffers suspect someone may have shot a pellet gun at the glass, he said. Nothing was taken from the congresswoman's office, Karamargin said. Staffers had stayed late at the office the night before because of the health care vote, but had left before the incident, he added. The office has never experience anything like it since Giffords' staff occupied the office in January 2007, Karamargin said, adding that staffers believe the incident was linked to the health care vote in Washington. In upstate New York, two similar incidents were reported before Sunday night's vote, according to CNN affiliate WHEC. A brick was thrown through the window of the Monroe County Democratic Committee headquarters in Rochester, and another was tossed through a window of Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter's office in Niagara Falls early Friday. WHEC reported that a note attached to the brick in the Monroe County office read ""extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice"" -- a quote delivered in an acceptance speech by Republican president candidate Barry Goldwater at the 1964 GOP convention. No one was injured in either incident in New York. Slaughter told WHEC that her offices have recently received threatening phone calls. Speaking on the House floor Sunday, Slaughter referred to damage at her office, saying, ""The anger isn't just contained outside the Capitol. Last week someone hurled a brick through the window of my district office in the dark of night. We must step back to remind ourselves of why we are here."" The House of Representatives on Sunday passed the sweeping $875 billion health care reform bill in a 219-212 vote. All 178 Republicans opposed it, along with 34 Democrats. Both Giffords and Slaughter supported the measure, though authorities investigating the incidents have not officially confirmed the link to the health care vote. Another incident was reported earlier in the weekend by the Sedgwick County Democratic Party in Kansas. Party Executive Director Lyndsey Stauble told CNN that a brick with anti-Obama and anti-health care messages was thrown at the headquarters sometime late Friday or early Saturday. Nothing was taken, and no one was injured, she said, adding that a bakery next door called police. Stauble mentioned that a recent post on a blog encouraged people to throw bricks at local Democratic offices nationwide. The Alabama-based blog, called ""Sipsey Street Irregulars,"" says it has launched a ""window war"" against Democrats and has kept a tally of the recent incidents of damage, including the ones in New York and Kansas. Blogger Michael B. Vanderboegh of Pinson, Alabama, told CNN Monday that in a Friday blog -- which he says was posted after the incident at Slaughter's office -- he called for people to break windows at Democratic headquarters at the city and county level. He said he didn't call for the damages to congressional offices because, ""I didn't want to be responsible for anybody breaking a federal law."" However, ""I can understand how someone can be frustrated enough to throw a brick through a congresswoman's window,"" Vanderboegh said. He said he feels the health care bill is ""unconstitutional and tyrannical."" ""My answer is violence, by getting their attention,"" he said, adding, ""If we can get across to the other side, that they are within inches of provoking a civil war in this country, then that's a good thing.""","NEW: Alabama-based blog calls for ""window war"" against Democrats .

"(CNN) -- Some athletes will go to any lengths to get their hands on an Olympic gold medal. Marion Jones and Ben Johnson are just two examples of champions whose achievements have been scrubbed from the record books due to drug scandals. But competitors who want to run the risk of taking performance-enhancing substances before or during this year's Summer Olympics will face the most sophisticated anti-doping operation in the history of the Games, according to London 2012 organizers. More than 6,250 samples of blood and urine will be tested during both the Olympics and Paralympics -- four years ago in Beijing that figure was around 4,500 -- with around 150 scientists on duty around the clock. For the first time in Olympics history, a private sponsor -- pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) -- will be aiding the effort, providing the facilities for the scientists to carry out their work. The $30 million state-of-the-art laboratory in Harlow, Essex is a short distance from the Olympic Park in east London and is fully accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). ""I think it's a significant involvement,"" WADA's director general David Howman told CNN. ""The laboratory will have everything it could possibly need in terms of equipment. If athletes go to London, they know if they are cheating they are likely to be caught."" Professor David Cowan, director of King's College London's Drug Control Center and chief scientist for the Games, is delighted that GSK is helping out. ""These laboratories are the most high-tech labs in the history of the Games, analyzing more samples than ever before,"" Cowan said. With GSK's support, Cowan and his colleagues have been able to develop ""super-fast, super-sensitive technologies"" capable of detecting prohibited substances. ""Across the range of instrument in the lab, we reckon we can pick up things you haven't even thought of,"" Cowan said. ""I think we'll soon be away from the days where designer drugs beat the analyst. I'm hoping this will be the Games that actually prove that."" Howman says the list of banned substances runs to 10-15 pages, with hundreds of drugs currently prohibited. ""The fight continues and the sophistication continues on both sides. You find that athletes and those that advise athletes are more sophisticated in what they do than they were 10 years ago,"" he said. But he says the London 2012 program is ""very, very good,"" reiterating that drug-takers will be found out. ""If they are not caught now they can be caught within the next eight years because samples can be re-analyzed."" Things have moved on significantly since the Olympics' most infamous case of drug taking, he says. ""I don't think Ben Johnson would even get to London nowadays -- I think he would be picked up in advance, and many athletes now who think they can get there will be swept away by pre-Games testing,"" Howman said. ""There were 80-90 athletes who didn't go to Beijing because of pre-testing and I presume that the same sort of number might arise this time around."" After winning the 100 meters final in Seoul in 1988, a reporter asked the Canadian sprinter what was more precious: a world record or the gold medal? Johnson chose the latter. ""Why?"" the reporter asked. ""Because it's something nobody can take away from you,"" he replied. The message coming from London 2012 organizers this year is, ""Yes we can, and we will.""","London 2012 organizers enlist help of state-of-the-art laboratory for drug testing .

"(CNN) -- CSKA Moscow will play its next home European Champions League match with part of its stadium closed as punishment for racism offenses. Manchester City complained its players had been subjected to ""monkey chants"" during a match against CSKA at the Arena Khimki on October 23. European football's governing body UEFA announced the sanction on Wednesday, warning CSKA that further incidents of racism would results in graver punishments. ""The UEFA Control and Disciplinary Body has handed down sanctions to CSKA Moscow following incidents during their UEFA Champions League home game against Manchester City,"" read a UEFA statement. ""Specifically, the Control and Disciplinary Body has decided to close sector D of the stadium during the club's next UEFA competition home match. ""CSKA's next home fixture is scheduled against Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League on 27 November in Moscow. ""The fight against racism is a high priority for UEFA ... All forms of racist behavior are considered serious offenses against the disciplinary regulations and are punished with the most severe sanctions."" City's Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure declared himself ""furious"" in a post-match interview with the club's TV channel, calling on UEFA to ""ban them (CSKA) for a couple of years."" Two former Premier League footballers were far from impressed with the sanction meted out to the Russian club, taking to Twitter to criticize the decision. ""Wow. Partial closure of stadium for 1 match for racist abuse for CSKA Moscow! Those boys at UEFA are sooo tough!"" opined former Southampton player Matt Le Tissier, who now works as a football pundit. Another former player who has also gone into broadcasting - Stan Collymore - was similarly scathing. ""I'm a racist. I'm going to move to section E against Bayern ... more Uefa clownery,"" wrote the former Nottingham Forest and Liverpool player. Nonetheless, UEFA regulations state that a first racism offense should be punished with a partial stadium closer, a second incident of discrimination would results in a full stadium closure for one match and a â¬50,000 ($68,000) fine. Any club found guilty of racism a third time faces the prospect of multiple matches behind closed doors, the forfeiting of a match, deduction of points or expulsion from a competition.","UEFA punish CSKA Moscow for racism offenses .

"(CNN) -- It's no wonder the illustrious Silver Arrow has a special place in the Mercedes team's hearts. The car with the distinctive silver livery has delivered some of its greatest victories -- from successive world championships in the 1950s to the China Grand Prix earlier this month. Now a new generation of Mercedes stars will be paying homage to the racy little number -- and its most famous driver -- ahead of the DTM season opener this weekend. Almost 57 years after F1 legend Juan Manual Fangio won the Italian Grand Prix in the Silver Arrow, driver Nico Rosberg will again be getting behind the wheel of the classic car. Rosberg's career-first F1 win at this month's China Grand Prix is Mercedes' first victory since Fangio in Italy in 1955. And to mark the occasion, 26-year-old Rosberg will be taking the classic Mercedes W196 for a spin on Saturday before the DTM touring car series season opener at Hockenheim. ""I am absolutely delighted to be returning to Hockenheim as a Grand Prix winner,"" he said on the Mercedes F1 website. ""Last year, I was able to drive a classic Silver Arrow on the famous Nurburgring Nordschleife, so now I'm really looking forward to climbing into the cockpit of Juan Manuel Fangio's phenomenal W196 streamliner from Monza in 1955 and driving a few laps at Hockenheim. ""It means a lot to me that we have written a new chapter in the wonderful history of Mercedes in motorsport -- and that there is plenty more still to come."" The German follows in the footsteps of F1 racing father Keke, who won the world title with Williams in 1982. However he still has some catching up to do to his famous Finnish father who collected five race wins in a nine-season career from 1978 to 1986. ""I have great memories of the DTM,"" Rosberg said. ""The earliest date back to when my father was still racing. Then I started competing in the various junior classes that are staged as part of the DTM race weekend as I started out on my own motorsport career. A lot has happened in the meantime, and the highlight so far was obviously my win in China one week ago."" Rosberg, who failed to repeat his performance in last week's Bahrain Grand Prix, finishing fifth, will be joined on the track by fellow Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher. The seven-time world champion, who finished 10th in Bahrain, will be behind the wheel of the 2011 Silver Arrow MGP W02 on Sunday. ""After a busy start to the Formula One season with four flyaway races in succession, it will be nice to come back to Germany,"" said Schumacher, whose younger brother Ralf -- a former F1 competitor -- drives in the DTM series. ""I'm especially looking forward to the chance to give the fans a taste of a Formula One Silver Arrow in action. This will be my first visit to a DTM race in 20 years, and I hope that my brother and his fellow Mercedes-Benz drivers will get their season off to a great start.""","The Silver Arrow has an important place in Mercedes history .

"(CNN) -- There was a time when Tel Aviv's beachfront was just another neighborhood sandwiched between the city's bustling Namal port district and historic old town. Not anymore. Today the area is home to some of Israel's most sought-after luxury real estate and has been dubbed the ""Golden Kilometer"" thanks to the rocketing cost of living space. A seventeenth floor apartment of 600 square meters (6,420 square feet) here sold for $23 million recently, a record for Tel Aviv. In the same area, a rented unit of 300 square meters (3,228 square feet) is on the market for $10 million. These premium prices represent a big change for a city that was brought to its knees due by large debts at the end of the 1990s. In the last four years alone, however, the waterfront property market has generated nearly half a billion dollars of investment. See also: Where are the world's most expensive luxury properties? The turning point can be traced back to the development of the city's Namal Port area. It was here that architects Ganit and Udi Kassif won the contract to renovate a huge space that had sat idle for 50 years. The pair quickly set about creating quirky living and work space for the city's hip up-and-comers. ""This project started a real revolution,"" said Ganit Kassif. ""After this many mayors said to us, make it like the Tel Aviv port."" Old empty warehouses in Namal are now filled with creative types and cutting edge retailers. One of these young merchants is Shir Halpern, owner of the city's first organic market. Although initially skeptical about setting up shop in an old industrial space, he now sees the virtue of the location. ""At the beginning the port felt to me like too isolated ... too far from the vibrance (sic) and power of the city,"" Halpern said. ""But looking back it was really a perfect choice."" See also: Could micro-homes offer big solution? The lively, can do vibe of Namal has since spread to other areas of the city, including the beachfront. But while the most lucrative properties may reside by the sea, the high end market can be found spreading to other districts as well.

According to the city's mayor, Ron Huldai, however, Tel Aviv's fundamental landscape and attractions are what continue make it such an appealing place to live whether that be in a luxury abode or not.

"(CNN) -- Barefoot and covered in dirt and sweat, 14-year-old Dante Campilan pulls weeds from orderly rows of sugar cane. Wearing an oversized red cap to protect him from the scorching Philippine sun, Dante is doing work that should be reserved for men, not children. Earning 150 pesos ($3.50) for a seven-hour day, Dante has been a child laborer in the Philippine region of Mindanao since he was seven years old. He says he does it to help his parents, but he is just one of many children who are part of an illegal economic system of child labor. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates 2.4 million child workers are in the Philippines. Many of them, according to the ILO, are in rural areas working in fields and mines. The organization estimates 60% work in hazardous conditions. Alongside Dante is 13-year-old Alvic James, who dropped out of school when he was in the first grade. Back then, he explained, his family didn't have enough money to eat. Alvic says he wants to learn to read and write but because he is needed in the fields he has no time to go to school. When the boys turn 15 or 16, they'll move on to the more hazardous job of cutting sugar cane. That's currently the job of 16-year-old Elmar Paran, who hasn't been to school since he was a young child, sentencing him to a future in the fields. The use of child laborers in the sugar fields of Northern Mindanao is so common that landowner Angeles Penda shrugs it off as a way of life. ""The parents beg us to include their children to work,"" she said. Much of the sugar produced in the fields here ends up in coffee shops, on kitchen tables and on store shelves across the world. ""We do not deny that child labor exists in our industry,"" said Edith Villanueva, the president and COO of the Sugar Industry Foundation. ""It's a practice among families who are paid piecemeal for their work. They like to employ their children because there's more income for the families."" Villanueva said that paying workers more so they're not tempted to use their children has not worked in the past. She cites the strong cultural ties of families working together in the fields as one of the main problems. ""If you don't change their attitude and their values, then you don't change their way of life. There's a long-term solution and it's really education. We feel children should want to go to school, they should be kept in school, and aware of the rights of the children, the rights of the child to go to school and the right of the child to play,"" she said. The child labor problem is so overt and widespread in this region that Villanueva says the Sugar Industry Foundation and the Coca-Cola Foundation are paying to build a four-room high school that is set to open later this month. The Coca-Cola company is one of the largest buyers of sugar in the world and the sugar factories fed by the fields of Northern Mindanao call Coca-Cola one of their main customers. In a statement to CNN, Coca-Cola said it ""does not support, encourage or endorse any form of child labor in our operations throughout our global bottling system or in our supplier network."" The company says it conducts continuous assessments of its operations to ensure strong policies and practices are in place to help avoid child labor. In September 2010, the Coca-Cola Foundation says it joined a coalition of the local government, the ILO and private industry to remove children from sugarcane fields with the hope of eradicating child labor in the Bukidnon region. The Philippines government has also pledged to reduce child labor by 75% by 2015. By then Dante will be 17-years-old. It's more likely that he will have graduated to cutting sugar cane than high school.","Child labor is common practice is Philippine region of Mindanao .

"(CNN) -- Record breaking wicketkeeper Mark Boucher's enforced retirement is a ""huge loss"" for South African cricket, its former chief Ali Bacher told CNN Wednesday. Boucher was the victim of a freak accident while playing for the South African tourists in England against county side Somerset as splinters from a bail left him with a serious eye injury. The 35-year-old Boucher was set to be a key figure for the Proteas in their upcoming series against Test cricket's top ranked team in England, but has been left in his own words with an ""uncertain recovery "" after emergency surgery on his left eye. Bacher, who was in charge of South African cricket when Boucher first came to prominence in 1997, paid his own tribute. ""A fierce competitor, very determined, always playing to win. I would call him as a terrific pressure player,"" he said. ""He seemed to rise to the occasion, whenever South Africa got into trouble,"" Bacher added. Boucher averaged just over 30 with the bat with five Test centuries, but his work behind the stumps set new milestones. He has a record number of 555 dismissals in Tests and 999 in all forms of international cricket, a tantalizing one short of the thousand mark. He also played a record number of Tests at 147 for a wicketkeeper. Many of them were during the career of former South African paceman Makhaya Ntini, the pair combining to send many batsmen back to the pavilion. ""I think special mention should be made of the role that he played in the ultimate success of Makhaya Ntini,"" said Bacher. ""There's no question, speaking to Makhaya on many occasions that Mark had a very profound beneficial effect on his career as a mentor, to guide him, to give him the benefit of his experience as Makhaya became an international budding star for South Africa."" Boucher had an inspirational effect on all his teammates and tributes have flooded in since his career was cut short in such unfortunate fashion. Bacher, himself a former Test star, said it was likely AB de Villiers would take his place behind the stumps for the series against England which starts next week. Thami Tsolikile, 31, has also been drafted into the squad as a replacement. But Bacher said Boucher would be tough to replace in the short term. ""It's a huge loss for South African cricket, he's had a most distinguished career in cricket for his country and he will certainly go down as one of our greatest ever cricketers.""","Former South African chief Ali Bacher pays tribute to Mark Boucher .

"(CNN) -- When Thai monarch, King Rama, founded Bangkok in the late 18th century, he bestowed upon the bustling waterway that ran through his new capital a title fit for royalty -- ""Chao Phraya"" (the River of Kings). Settlers to the city built their homes along the river's banks, its waters providing the maritime access essential for commerce as well as the fish to feed a growing population. Today, Chao Phraya remains a busy thoroughfare. The living space that has built up aside its shores however is vastly different. See also: Thailand's luxury property market . This transformation is no more apparent than at the edges of Khlong Ton Sai, a formerly barren neighborhood on the river's western banks. It is here that ""The River"" -- an aptly named tower of condominiums and luxury living space -- soars above the bustling waters and streets below. At 256 meters (840 feet) tall, the giant structure is 6 meters (19 feet) taller than Chao Phraya is wide, making it the tallest residential building in Thailand. For Hans Brower, the Thai-Dutch design consultant behind the project, The River is a potent symbol of modern Bangkok -- a vibrant metropolis that can offer spectacular accommodation at cheaper rate than other big Asian cities. Lush gardens and quiet pools in the facility grounds maintain the feel of an urban oasis amidst the surrounding concrete jungle. ""Living on the river affords you the ability to have a space like this which could be a resort if you did not have this poster which is the city of Bangkok,"" Brower explained. ""It has that 5 star feel."" A new track . A key component of Bangkok's riverside regeneration and the rise of facilities like The River has been improved transport links, Brower explained. Myriad boat services frequently cross Chao Phraya while the city's skytrain (known locally as the BTS) has provided faster access to areas that were once considered too out of the way and poorly connected. See also: China's crazy property bubble . ""I think the definition of a boundary changes radically depending on accessibility and mobility and that has changed,"" Bower said. ""Today the BTS comes across and goes all the way into west (of the) country."" While the skytrain has ensured properties like The River are viable and desirable, it has also had a knock-on impact on the areas it passes through. Those who live in its shadows have seen their property values soar. ""I could earn something already (by selling),"" explained said Chaiyot Suriyanonlin, standing outside the humble shop-house that has been in his family's possession for generations. ""Whatever my father left for me I should do my best to keep it for (his) legacy,"" he added. Developers' paradise . For developers, meanwhile, a relaxation of planning laws (restrictions on how high they can build have been set aside) has incentivized the construction of quality accommodation in areas like those which host the Suriyanonlin abode. ""The regulations limit what you can do in various places so at the time this site came up it was an opportunity to do something big,"" said Gerry Healey, who oversees The River for developer Raimon Land. Although roughly 10% of apartments remain without owners (primarily those not overlooking the water), there is a strong financial incentive for developers to invest in Bangkok. As Healey illustrates, the average cost per unit was $3,400 a square meter in 2007. Today they go for $4,700, with penthouses selling for three times that amount. ""The prices that we are asking for here maybe in the higher end of the Bangkok market but by comparison with Singapore or Hong Kong we are very (affordable),"" Healy said. In fact, this equates to just a fifth of the price of luxury property in Singapore. While such sums still represent a considerable outlay, Healey's hope is that potential investors will be encouraged to snap up the remaining properties and become part of the next chapter of Bangkok's famous river.","At 256 meters tall, ""The River"" is Thailand's tallest residential tower .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, conservative social crusader and perpetual GOP presidential candidate, sounded a downcast note over the weekend when asked about the possibility of another White House run in 2016. ""Yeah, I don't know if I can do this,"" Santorum told the Associated Press. ""It's just tough."" Santorum cited the health of his 5-year-old daughter Bella, who suffers from the genetic disorder Trisomy 8, and a new job as the CEO at a faith-oriented movie company as reasons why he may pass on a repeat White House run. Earlier: Santorum 'very open' to another presidential bid . Left unsaid: The Republican field is shaping up to be more impressive this time, making the path to the nomination even more difficult for the 2012 GOP runner-up, who came close to toppling frontrunner Mitt Romney during their winter primary clash by rallying Christian conservatives and working class primary voters to his side. Still, despite his candor about the challenges ahead, Santorum is very much keeping his name in the 2016 mix and relentlessly plugging away behind-the-scenes. Earlier: Santorum's busy day in Iowa . Few Republicans question Santorum's work ethic. His early-and-often visits with grassroots activists in all of Iowa's 99 counties helped propel him to a breakout win in the Iowa caucuses in 2012. But Santorum is doing something different this time: He's making early connections with establishment leaders in the leadoff nominating states, an effort to make himself more palatable to powerful Republicans who were reluctant to embrace him in 2012 because of his unyielding views on social issues and his sometimes dour temperament. A trip last month to the early primary state of South Carolina revealed just how much political work Santorum is doing away from public view â and how badly he wants to be taken seriously by Republican forces who had trouble seeing him as their party's standard-bearer against President Barack Obama. Earlier: Santorum South Carolina bound . Here's a look at how much activity Santorum packed into a single 36-hour political tour of South Carolina: . â On April 14, Santorum arrived in Charleston, where two of his sons are cadets at The Citadel, for some family time. But South Carolina isn't just where his sons reside â it's a closely-watched primary state where GOP presidential hopefuls test their support among southern conservatives. Santorum addressed a luncheon on campus hosted by the Charleston County Republican Women, and while there, he gabbed with former South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster, a fixture of the state's GOP establishment and a candidate for lieutenant governor this year. â Santorum made time in between to take questions from reporters, dissing the ""weakness"" of Obama's foreign policy and calling on Republicans to do a better job relating to working class Americans instead of big business. The latter message, of course, doubled as a plug for the new book he's hawking, ""Blue Collar Conservatives."" â Later that evening, Santorum delivered remarks to the Charleston County Republican Committee, one of the state's most active county GOP organizations. Also in Charleston, Santorum raised money for Patriot Voices, a 501(c)4 group that advocates for conservative causes and helps fund his travel to very important places â like states that have presidential caucuses and primaries. â The following morning, Santorum was escorted around Columbia, the state capital and its political hub, by a South Carolina friend, and veteran of the 2012 campaign, lobbyist James D'Alessio. One of his first orders of business was a meeting with Richard Quinn, the longtime GOP political strategist who helped run the two presidential campaigns of John McCain, never a Santorum friend when the two served together in the Senate. Quinn said the get-together, held at his office, was just a chance to connect. They talked about his book â and about boiled peanuts. ""He had his first boiled peanut in my office,"" Quinn said. ""This is first chance we had to talk. I was extremely impressed. He has got a sense of humor and quick wit and twinkle in his eye. But we didn't talk about presidential politics. We had a nice little chat. But he wasn't interviewing me, nor was I interviewing him, for any kind of presidential relationship."" â Santorum dropped by the South Carolina state house, where he sat in the gallery and was introduced from the floor by state Sen. Thomas Alexander. Santorum then met with Alexander in the Senate antechamber, and posed for pictures with other members of the state legislature. Hogan Gidley, a South Carolina-based Republican who advised Santorum's 2012 campaign, said the potential candidate is being more methodical about building relationships as he eyes a second bid. ""I don't know if Rick can capture what he did before, but he is acting more pragmatic this time,"" Gidley said. ""It's not as much as a fly-by-night kind of organization like it was before. Last time he just decided to run and people came along with him. Now he is laying the groundwork to try to get people on board."" â Lunch break: Santorum dined with national and state officials from the Special Forces Association, an organization of active and retired Green Berets. The group was in town planning their national convention, which will be held in Columbia in June. â A stop by South Carolina Republican Party headquarters was next on the agenda. Santorum and D'Alessio had a meeting with state party chairman Matt Moore, who later tweeted a picture of the ""great visit."" â D'Alessio organized a cozy meet-and-greet for Santorum at the Palmetto Club, a private downtown hang-out frequented by South Carolina business and political honchos. Among those in attendance: Henry McMaster, Attorney General Alan Wilson, AT&T South Carolina president Pam Lackey and Trey Walker, a former McCain strategist who now steers government relations for the University of South Carolina. Walker offered Santorum tickets to that evening's baseball game against Charleston Southern. Santorum accepted. â At the last minute, Santorum popped into a private fundraiser for Charmeka Childs, a Republican candidate for education superintendent. Childs, a 36-year old African-American woman, is considered an up-and-comer by some members of the state's business community who hosted the event, including South Carolina Chamber of Commerce president Otis Rawl, South Carolina Business and Industry Political Committee president Tom DeLoach, and public affairs strategist Ed McMullen. Santorum met them during his brief drop-by. â Joined by his niece, an undergraduate at the University of South Carolina, Santorum ended the day taking in the college baseball game with other VIPs inside the president's box at Gamecock Stadium. Over beers, the two talked politics, with Walker re-hashing the ups and downs of McCain's victorious 2008 primary campaign. Santorum departed after about six innings. Walker left impressed. ""He makes a helluva second impression,"" he said of Santorum. Santorum: Georgia gun law to improve safety . Pence stays quiet on potential 2016 run .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A major search and rescue operation is underway after two cargo ships collided off the coast of Hong Kong early Monday. One man was plucked from the water by a passing fishing boat but 11 others are missing, according to Hong Kong police. The rescued man, a 46-year-old Chinese national, is being treated at a Hong Kong hospital, where his condition is stable. The accident happened at around 2.30 a.m. local time when the Marshall Islands-registered MOL Motivator, a 300-meter long container ship, collided with a smaller Chinese vessel, the Zhong Xing 2. The incident occurred three nautical miles southwest of Po Toi island, Marine Police told CNN. The smaller ship, believed to be transporting cement at the time, then sank with its crew of 12, police said. The MOL Motivator was leaving for Yantian in China's southern Guangdong Province from Hong Kong, according to local media reports.

"(CNN) -- The cricket world is mourning the passing of former England captain Tony Greig, a larger than life character who helped revolutionize the sport in the late 1970s before becoming a high-profile commentator. Greig died aged 66 on Saturday in his adopted home of Australia, having been diagnosed with lung cancer in October. Born in South Africa, the 6 foot 6 inch all-rounder qualified to play for England due to his Scottish father and represented his new country in 58 Test matches from 1972-77. However, he was stripped of the captaincy after becoming a leading figure in the breakaway World Series Cricket competition set up by Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer, who owned the Channel Nine network that Greig would work for until recently. ""Tony stood out as a player and captain, as an influential part of the Kerry Packer World Series Cricket era and then for decades as a familiar voice in millions of Australian living rooms each summer as part of the Nine telecast which revolutionized the TV presentation of cricket,"" Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards said in a statement. ""His illness and too-early death comes as a terrible shock -- he will be greatly missed."" Greig's fellow South African David Richardson, a former international player who is now head of the International Cricket Council, also paid tribute. ""Tony played a significant part in shaping modern cricket as a player in the 1970s and then provided millions of cricket lovers with a unique insight as a thoughtful and knowledgeable commentator,"" Richardson said. ""His figures in Test matches show that he was one of the leading all-rounders of his generation with a batting average of above 40 and a bowling average around 32."" Australia's prime minister Julia Gillard issued a joint statement with sports minister Kate Lundy that was published in the Sydney Morning Herald. ""Greig was a wonderful example of someone who came to Australia from somewhere else in the world and embraced his adopted country as his own,"" it said. ""Most Australians would be deeply familiar with Greig the commentator, in particular his unique brand of colorful game-calling and entertaining banter. His life in cricket wasn't always without controversy, but no one could doubt his passion and commitment to the sport he loved."" Greig, who went to England as a teenager in the late 1960s, was heavily criticized for an ""unsporting"" run out of West Indies batsman Alvin Kallicharan in 1974 that saw the home fans storm the pitch in protest. Greig then revoked his appeal and Kallicharan was reinstated. That ill feeling spilled over into the Caribbean team's series in England in 1976, before which Greig infamously said he would make the tourists ""grovel."" As recounted in the 2010 documentary ""Fire in Babylon,"" the incident fired up the West Indian players, who perceived it as a slight by their former colonial rulers, especially coming from a white South African at the height of apartheid. It sparked a transformation that made the tourists the dominant side in world cricket for the next two decades, as their bowlers battered Greig's team with a fearsome pace attack. Greig, having lost that series 3-0, then redeemed himself as he led England to a first victory in India in 15 years -- but his time at the helm would prove to be shortlived. He successfully took the English cricket authorities to court after they tried to ban the Packer ""rebels"" but his own playing contribution came to an end after the inaugural series. Greig moved into commentating, with the Nine Network and broadcasters around the world, as he teamed up with former cricketing opponents such as Ian Chappell. He is survived by his wife Vivian and children Mark, Sam, Beau and Tom. Meanwhile, veteran Australian batsman Mike Hussey has announced he will retire from international cricket after next week's third and final Test against Sri Lanka. The 37-year-old's decision comes in the same month that former Australia captain Ricky Ponting ended his career. Hussey scored 19 centuries in 78 Tests, being Australia's 12th-highest run scorer with a total of 6,183 at an average of 51.52.","Tony Greig dies in Australia following a short battle with lung cancer, aged 66 .

"(CNN) -- Michael Clarke has big cricketing shoes to fill following the retirement of Ricky Ponting, but the Australia captain has already wiped out one of his predecessor's records. Clarke beat Ponting's leading mark of 1,544 runs scored in a calendar year by an Australian batsman, set in 2003, as he made 106 on day two of the second Test against Sri Lanka. The 31-year-old posted his 22nd Test century -- still 19 behind Ponting -- and his first in Melbourne as the home team reached 440-8 at stumps on Thursday for a lead of 284. ""It is nice to get that monkey off my back and get my first hundred here,"" Clarke, who overcame a hamstring injury to start the match, told reporters after taking his total for 2012 to 1,595. ""In regards to beating Ricky, in my eyes he was the greatest batsman I was lucky enough to play with, so to beat any record that Ricky holds is very special."" Ponting retired at the start of this month following the series defeat by South Africa, being Australia's leading runscorer in all forms of cricket and the world's second highest behind Sachin Tendulkar of India. In a calendar year, only Pakistan's Mohammad Yousuf (1,788), West Indian Viv Richards (1,710) and South Africa's Graeme Smith (1,656) have scored more Test runs than Clarke. He might not get a second chance to bat in this match, with Australia in control. All-rounder Mitchell Johnson will seek to get the 27 runs he needs for his second Test century when he resumes his innings on day three. Clarke and Shane Watson had put on 194 for the fourth wicket as Sri Lanka lost pace bowler Chanaka Welegedara to a hamstring injury early in the day, before a mini-collapse saw the Australians slump to 315-6. Watson was among those to fall, being caught in the deep for 83 -- meaning he has not passed three figures in the five-day game since October 2010, despite registering 19 fifties in his 38 Test appearances. ""If he continues to play the way he played today and shows that patience and that discipline I have no doubt at all that he will score plenty of hundreds for Australia,"" Clarke said. ""He showed a lot of discipline in his shot selection and even the ball he got out on, as his captain, I am not disappointed with. Nine times out of 10 that will go for four or six."" Johnson steadied the innings as he added 61 for the seventh wicket with Mike Hussey (34) and 58 for the eighth with Peter Siddle (13) before seeing out the day with Nathan Lyon (0). Sri Lanka need to win the match to have any chance of winning the three-match series, having lost the opener by 137 runs. The tourists, who made just 156 in Wednesday's first innings after winning the toss and deciding to bat, were left to rue dropping Clarke on the opening day and then giving Watson two lives on Thursday. ""We let them off the hook yesterday in the evening when we had them three wickets down and today before Clarke got into his stride and then Watson after that,"" said batting coach Marvin Atapattu, a former skipper of the national side. ""If we had held on to those two it would have been different, but that is the way it goes and we have got ourselves to blame."" Meanwhile, Ponting has defended Australia's rotation policy after first Test hero Mitchell Starc was rested for the Melbourne match, allowing Jackson Bird to make his debut. Starc took six wickets in Hobart, five of them coming in Sri Lanka's second innings. ""A lot of the people that are talking about it, past bowlers in particular, have got no idea of the workload of some of the guys that are playing now,"" Ponting said. ""Everyone in and around the Australian team is trying to do the best thing for Australian cricket. It's all about trying to put the best and fittest bowlers on the park every time we can.""","Australia captain Michael Clarke sets new record for runs scored in calendar year .

"ST. PAUL, Minnesota (CNN) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin introduced herself to the world Wednesday by calling herself a ""hockey mom"" and then asking what the difference was between a hockey mom and a pit bull. Sarah Palin ripped Barack Obama and said she's ready for the ""challenge of a tough fight."" ""Lipstick,"" the Republican vice presidential nominee said. She promptly went on to prove the point, tearing into Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama as two-faced, inexperienced and intoxicated by the sound of his own voice. ""This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting and never use the word 'victory' except when he's talking about his own campaign,"" she said. She slammed Obama for ""saying one thing in Scranton and another in San Francisco,"" argued that he had written two memoirs but never authored a major piece of legislation and asked what he would do ""when those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot,"" a reference to the stage where Obama gave his acceptance speech last week.

""I think Sarah Palin can do a one-two punch better than Muhammad Ali,"" Kansas state Sen. Karin Brownlee said after the speech. ""And I think she delivered it just square on the opponents' face. I think she has energized the Republican Party like we haven't seen in a long time.""  Report card: Rate Palin's speech Â» .

Conventioneers waved banners reading ""Palin Power"" and ""Hockey moms for Palin."" Delegates from her home state of Alaska were spotted wearing buttons calling her ""the hottest VP from the coolest state."" ""I love those hockey moms,"" she said. Palin began with a lengthy, minutes-long standing ovation as she accepted the Republican Party's nomination for vice president. It marked the first time in history that a woman has taken the stage as the GOP vice presidential pick. ""I accept the challenge of a tough fight,"" said the woman nicknamed ""Sarah Barracuda."" The Obama campaign dismissed Palin's speech as ""well-delivered"" but said it was ""written by George Bush's speechwriter and sounds exactly like the same divisive, partisan attacks we've heard from George Bush for the last eight years."" iReport.com: Share your reaction to the convention speeches . Bush aide Matthew Scully was largely responsible for the speech. Palin's opposite number, Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden,  praised her speech as ""incredibly well crafted and delivered,"" but said Palin's rhetoric lacked substance.

I didn't hear a single word about helping people get to college,"" Biden, a U.S. senator from Delaware, told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Thursday. ""They don't have a single answer [for] how to dig us out of the hole we've been dug into the last eight years,"" Biden added. Palin, whose son is to deploy to Iraq soon, praised her running mate John McCain as a man who has met grave challenges and ""knows how tough fights are won."" She criticized Obama's stance on Iraq, saying he ""wants to forfeit"" while victory is ""finally in sight.""  Watch Palin say McCain has fought for change his entire life Â» . She praised McCain, a decorated war hero, as a ""true profile in courage."" ""In politics, there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers.

Throughout the speech, it was clear the first-term governor of Alaska had won over the hearts of the crowd. ""What exactly is our opponent's plan? What does he actually seek to accomplish after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet? The answer is to make the government bigger and take more of your money."" Palin, the former mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, contrasted her rÃ©sumÃ© as a former mayor of a small town with that of Obama. ""I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a 'community organizer,' except that you have actual responsibilities."" Palin presented herself as both a mother and as an outside-the-Beltway reformer in the McCain mold, saying she ""took on the old politics as usual in Juneau"" and ""stood up to the special interests, the lobbyists, big oil companies, and the good ol' boys network."" She tied oil, a major industry in her home state of Alaska, to foreign policy and national security on a night when convention delegates repeatedly burst into chants of ""Drill now, baby, drill now!""

Watch McCain take stage, get crowd fired up Â» . Just before Palin took center stage, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani warmed up the crowd by continuing the barrage on Obama, calling him a ""celebrity senator"" with no leadership experience. ""He's never had to lead people in crisis,"" Giuliani said. ""This is not a personal attack; it's a statement of fact. Barack Obama has never led anything. Nothing. Nada."" ""The choice in this election comes down to substance over style. John McCain has been tested. Barack Obama has not. Tough times require strong leadership, and this is no time for on-the-job training."" His speech was the third of the evening by former GOP presidential candidates who pumped up the Republican faithful ahead of Palin. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee got the crowd cheering when he ripped Obama for looking to Europe for ways to change America. ""Barack Obama's excellent adventure to Europe took his campaign for change to hundreds of thousands of people who don't even vote or pay taxes here,"" he said. ""The fact is, most Americans don't want more government; they want a lot less."" Huckabee said McCain represents small government and has ideas for change that will make the nation's economy better. He added that McCain is ""a man with the character and stubborn kind of integrity that I want in a president."" Huckabee took a jab at the ""elite media"" for ""unifying the Republican Party and all of America"" in support of McCain and Palin. ""The reporting of the past few days has proven tackier than a costume change at a Madonna concert,"" Huckabee said. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney blasted ""liberal Washington,"" saying McCain is a ""prescription for every American who wants change in Washington."" He added that it's time to take a ""Weedwhacker"" to excessive regulation and to impose lower taxes and to stop big-government spending. ""Throw out the big-government liberals and elect John McCain,"" Romney said. ""We need change, all right: change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington."" He also threw his support behind Palin, saying the McCain-Palin ticket ""will keep America as it has always been: the hope of the world."" ""We will never allow America to retreat in the face of evil extremism,"" Romney said. The Republican Party officially nominated McCain for president at the convention Wednesday. McCain will give a speech accepting the nomination Thursday night. Police said two protesters were removed during Palin's speech. They said they were members of the anti-war group Code Pink. A representative for the Joint Information Center said the two women were escorted by law enforcement officers from the Xcel Center for heckling. They stood and yelled off to the side of the podium during Palin's speech. They were not charged and have been ""sent on their way,"" this representative said.

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi is not for sale. That was the defiant message from Barcelona's new president, who is adamant that the club's all-time leading goalscorer is going nowhere amid reports French club Paris St Germain want to sign the Argentine. Josep Maria Bartomeu will sit down with the four-time World Player of the Year to thrash out a new contract which will see him remain as most highly-paid at the Camp Nou. ""We want to sit down, without any rush, with Leo's father -- it's not something that's happening tomorrow, we have plenty of time, but we will do what we have to to ensure he's the best paid player,"" said Josep Maria Bartomeu, who assumed control at Barca after Sandro Rosell's resignation last week. Messi arrived at Barca in 2000 , graduating through the club's youth system before going on to establish himself as the best player on the planet.

"(CNN) -- Screen-Free Week, the international, seven-day celebration of life beyond screen-based amusements, begins today. It's a great time to take a much-needed vacation from digital entertainment. Each year, often in conjunction with schools, organizations and whole communities, families exchange their usual screen-based leisure time activities for more time playing, creating, reading, dreaming, connecting with nature and enjoying family and friends. (Yes, we still have to use screens for work and homework.) If you can't celebrate this year, make it a point to join us in 2015. Taking a break gives us a chance to catch our breath, look at how much time we and our children spend with screens and perhaps even decide to make some important lifestyle changes. Many kids spend too much time with screens -- and it's not good for them. As a psychologist and director of an advocacy organization focused on children and families, I frequently speak to parents about the impact of media and technology on young children. What I hear repeatedly is that the recent explosion of screen devices raises increasingly complicated challenges. Digital media are so compelling, exciting and omnipresent that it's getting harder to figure out how, when and even whether to set limits. Adding to the confusion is the ubiquitous and persuasive marketing of screen products as educational for young children -- even for babies -- and that digital media are a often a surefire way for overstressed parents to keep their children occupied. Screens are a fact of 21st-century life, and kids find them entrancing. Why should we set limits or deprive young children of digital experiences? One compelling reason is that excessive screen time is linked to a host of childhood problems, including poor school performance, attention issues, sleep disturbance, obesity and more. That's why the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends discouraging screen time for children younger than 2 and setting limits on time and content for older children. Because the explosion of smart phones and tablets is so new, most of the research on harmful effects is associated with television, but emerging studies are beginning to raise concerns about time with all kinds of digital media. At the same time, research suggests that monitoring time and content can mitigate some of screen media's negative effects. As kids get older, setting limits becomes more challenging, but it's still important. By adolescence, if not before, digital technologies are often completely integrated into homework assignments, connecting with friends and gathering information about the world. That's why many families make sure to preserve screen-free family meals or institute at least one night a week when, except for homework, they all ditch their devices and spend time engaged in other activities. Since it's much easier to increase children's time with screens rather than take it away, it's helpful to recognize the need to make thoughtful decisions about media use early on. What do our youngest children actually learn from digital media? One thing they may learn is to need screens for stimulation and soothing. For better or worse, the roots of lifelong habits and behaviors form in early childhood. The experiences we have in our first years of life -- and the experiences we don't have -- shape the very structure of our brains. Limited time with quality screen media and technology can be educational for preschoolers. But digital devices are by no means essential to their learning. As for babies and toddlers, the more time children younger than 2 spend with screens, the more time they spend as older children and the harder time they have turning them off. Despite unsubstantiated corporate marketing claims that apps can teach babies as young as 6 months numbers and letters, there's no evidence that infants and toddlers learn anything meaningful from any kind of screen time. There is plenty of evidence about what they need for healthy brain development -- hands-on play, active play and face-to-face engagement with the adults who love them. Babies thrive when they're talked to, played with and read to. Time with screens takes them away from those crucial activities. What's most important for babies, preschoolers and even kindergartners is to learn how to learn. They need the time, space and silence for hands-on creative play. They need to explore the world with all their senses, to nurture their creativity and constructive problem solving and to learn social skills to build the ability to work and play with other people. They need to acquire patience, develop stamina and be able to delay gratification. They need to learn to act, rather than merely react. They need to learn to generate their own amusements and to enjoy and value their own creations. Young children can't learn most of these skills and attributes effectively from a screen. In fact, most of what very young children encounter on a screen today inhibits rather than promotes the kind of creative problem solving so essential to learning.

"(CNN) -- Oxbow, after a sixth-place showing at the Kentucky Derby, led wire-to-wire to claim victory Saturday at the 138th running of the Preakness Stakes. The horse, ridden by veteran Gary Stevens, dashed the Triple Crown hopes of Orb, which finished fourth at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. Itsmyluckday finished second and Mylute was third. Oxbow's winning time was 1:57:54 over the 1 3/16-mile course, 4ÃÂ½ seconds slower than the record set by Triple Crown winner Secretariat in 1973. Oxbow came into the Preakness as a 15-1 shot, and ""didn't get a lot of respect after the Derby,"" Stevens, who came out of retirement earlier this year, told NBC. Preakness Stakes: Fun facts about 'the middle sister' The 50-year-old Stevens in January took a call from Oxbow trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who he told him ""I'm going to have a colt for you."" That colt was Oxbow. ""His mind was right"" on Saturday, said Stevens. He didn't expect his horse to go to the lead so early, but it didn't leave him gassed at the end. ""He exploded home coming off the turn,"" Stevens said. Orb, the Derby winner and a 3-5 favorite at the Preakness Stakes, got a clean start from the inside post but soon became boxed in on the rail where he started. He was hemmed in among the other colts, unable to stake a position on the outside as he had in rallying to victory at Churchill Downs on May 4. The third Triple Crown race, the Belmont Stakes, is set for June 8 in New York. Stevens, a Hall of Fame jockey, said Oxbow maintained a ""nice, easy pace."" ""What you saw out there was the way we trained,"" Stevens said. ""His ears were up so he was telling me he was comfortable and it was just like we worked out."" Former racehorses get a second chance at life . It was the third Preakness victory for Stevens, who had settled into a second career as a race commentator before the call from Lukas. ""He's like a brother, a coach and a father figure to me,"" Stevens said of Lukas, who now claims six Preakness winners. Crowning glory: The artful hats of horse racing . CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- As Facebook continues the slow rollout of a tool to let users search out others by using common interests or other personal information, the site emphasized Thursday that minors will get special privacy protections. Graph Search capitalizes on Facebook's massive bank of data about its users, or ""social graph,"" to seek out friends, or other users who have made their information public, using information about them. So, for example, you could seek out friends who ""like"" director Quentin Tarantino to make an invite list to see ""Django Unchained"" Friday night or remind yourself which of your friends are over 21 and live in Austin, Texas, to do some bar-hopping while you're in town. But privacy advocates are worried. While Graph Search won't show you any information that you couldn't see otherwise, it does pull all that data together in one place in a way that could have some creepy uses. Say, searching for the names of girls who attend a certain middle school. That's the sort of thing Facebook aims to prevent. Details including birthday, school, hometown and current city will only be available about users under 18 to their friends and friends of friends. And friends of friends will only be able to see them if they, too, are under 18. ""What we really wanted to do was try to identify things that could be even more sensitive for minors -- that would identify them by their age and location,"" Nicky Jackson Colaco, Facebook's manager of Privacy & Safety, told CNN Thursday. ""Those kind of things are more sensitive and we wanted to really make sure they had an even more restrictive experience."" Of course, she noted, the extra protections only kick in if minors are honest about the age they give to register for the site. ""This is true across Facebook. It's really important to us that minors represent their real age,"" she said, urging parents to make sure their children are doing so. ""If they tell us they're 25, they're not getting these protections and a lot of other protections we offer."" Separate from Graph Search, Facebook already limits some content posted by minors to ""Friends of Friends"" only, even if the young user has made it public. The site's minimum age is 13. The tool was announced last month by CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The new search feature lets you draw connections between people, their profile information and their interests on Facebook. In theory, it's a good recipe for finding recommendations for doctors, businesses, products, TV shows or bands. It can also be used to find people that fit a specific profile, such as ""men over 30 who live in Cleveland."" Users will be able to seek out people who aren't their Facebook friends using the tool. But the only information they'll see are things that a user has posted as ""public"" to the site. Graph Search currently has only been made available to a handful of early testers. But some of them have used it in ways they say raise privacy concerns. British tech blogger and ""gadget geek"" Tom Scott created a blog called ""Actual Facebook Graph Searches."" While some are humorous (people who like both the anti-gay marriage Focus on the Family and openly gay actor Neil Patrick Harris) others suggested something more troubling. For example, he shows a search for family members of people of Chinese descent who like Falun Gong, the religious movement banned in China. Or one for Islamic men living in Tehran, Iran, who are romantically interested in other men. (Homosexuality is illegal there). The searches could then be refined to see photos of the users, their friends and places they've worked. Facebook has emphasized privacy settings to keep such information from being publicly visible and said they're continuing to fine-tune the tool as it rolls out. In December, Facebook overhauled it's privacy controls, adding a handful of features while simplifying and clarifying how existing features work.","Facebook Graph Search to have extra protections for minors .

"(CNN) -- For the second time in six months, Henrique Capriles Radonski will be in an electoral fight for the presidency of Venezuela. His opponent is different this time, but the stakes may be even higher: What course will the South American country chart after the death of Hugo Chavez? In October, Capriles proved to be the strongest challenger the opposition ever fielded against Chavez, yet he still he lost to the charismatic leader by double-digits. But Chavez's battle with cancer kept him from being sworn in, and he died March 5. On Sunday, Capriles will be in a contest against Nicolas Maduro, the interim president and the man Chavez picked as his successor. Q&A: Venezuela's presidential election . At age 40, he has been a mayor, a parliament leader, and a governor of a major state who has been given a second chance to win the presidency. ""I am seeking to win the confidence of all Venezuelans,"" Capriles said recently. ""I want a united country. I want Venezuelans to join together (and) work together with a single goal."" The most important issue, he says, is to tackle poverty. Generous social programs are a foundation of the government that Chavez headed, and Capriles has that he will not do away with them. But he has promised to end the large subsidies that Venezuela provides to Chavez allies. An attorney, Capriles was elected to parliament in 1998, when Venezuela had a bicameral legislature. He was just 25 years old at the time, but he quickly advanced to become the president of the Chamber of Deputies and then president of the entire Parliament. But the bicameral legislature was dissolved in 1999. The following year, Capriles was elected mayor of Baruta, which is located in the state of Miranda and is a suburb in the Caracas metropolitan area. He became mayor with more than 60% of the vote. In 2002, he become involved in violent anti-government demonstrations outside the Cuban Embassy and spent four months in jail. He was eventually released and cleared of any wrongdoing. He then was re-elected mayor with almost 80% approval in 2004. In 2008, he ran for governor of Miranda state and won. Capriles' grandparents were Polish Holocaust survivors, but he is a practicing Catholic, according to the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center.","Henrique Capriles Radonski is running for president for the second time in six months .

"Washington (CNN) -- African-American female lawmakers are taking the Army to task for a new ban on a number of ethnic hairstyles, guidelines which some are calling racially discriminatory. The group from the Congressional Black Caucus wrote Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Thursday urging the military to reconsider the rule. ""Though we understand the intent of the updated regulation is to ensure uniformity in our military, it is seen as discriminatory rules targeting soldiers who are women of color with little regard to what is needed to maintain their natural hair,"" the letter said. Nate Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman, said it had received the letter, appreciated their concerns and ""will respond promptly and directly to them."" The Army previously said it rejects any charges of discrimination, especially since black women were involved in helping craft the new guidelines regulating everything from the style of hair parts, the width of braids and how far thick hair can extend from the scalp. ""African American female soldiers were involved in the process of developing the new female hair standards,"" said Troy Rolan, an Army spokesman. ""Not only were nearly 200 senior female leaders and soldiers (which included a representative sample of the Army's populations) part of the decision-making process on the female hair standards, but the group was also led by an African American female."" The Army has faced pushback from some African-American members of the military and black civilian supporters over new guidelines that mandate such things as hair ""must be of uniform dimension, small in diameter (approximately ÃÂ¼ inch), show no more than 1/8 (inch) of the scalp between the braids."" Army rules ban dreadlocks and twists of any kind as well as styles it views as ""unkempt"" or ""matted."" That type of language rankled the Black Caucus members. The issue, they say, is that such phrasing implies that ethnic hair that is ""natural"" or not straightened with heat or chemicals is somehow unruly and must be carefully regulated to fit within white cultural norms. ""The use of words like 'unkempt' and 'matted' when referring to traditional hairstyles worn by women of color are offensive,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""The assumption that individuals wearing these hairstyles cannot maintain them in a way that meets the professionalism of Army standards indicates a lack of cultural sensitivity conducive to creating a tolerant environment for minorities."" In issuing its newest set of appearance guidelines, the Army has found itself entangled in centuries old identity politics that have been a sore point for the African-American community since slavery.

"(CNN) -- It is a well known fact in golf -- nobody who wins the Par 3 contest at Augusta goes on to win the Masters in the same week. Ryan Moore will be the latest man who trying to avoid the curse after carding a six-under 21 to win the competition Wednesday. U.S. star Moore, whose best finish at Augusta came in 2005 in 13th, finished two shots clear at the top of the leaderboard. ""I'm not afraid of it,"" he told reporters after being asked about the curse. ""You never know, someone has got to break that curse at some point in time, so hopefully it's me. ""It was fun having my boy out there and playing a round with a couple of friends. That's what it's for, to kind of make you relax a little bit and just go and enjoy yourself the afternoon before."" The idea for the Par 3 Contest was the brainchild of Clifford Roberts, a former chairman and co-founder of Augusta. Sam Snead won the first competition in 1960 and it has since become an integral part of the lead up to the Masters. Players invited their wives, girlfriends, mothers and children to caddy for them Wednesday as traditions were maintained. Rory McIlroy, who is one of the favorites for the title, allowed tennis star girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki to carry his bags for the day. Elsewhere, several babies were seen on greens as crowds flocked to see Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Arnold Palmer in action. The real action begins Thursday at 7.45am local time with Stuart Cink of the U.S. getting proceedings underway alongside South Africa's Tim Clark. Defending champion Adam Scott goes out in the 16th group with Jason Dufner and English amateur Matthew Fitzpatrick. McIlroy, who is aiming for a third major, goes out next with Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed.","Ryan Moore wins Par 3 contest at Augusta .

"(CNN) -- The bright yellow front wall of the compound is lined with perfectly pruned palm trees. Our hosts open a metal gate and usher us inside to a large yard with a fresh-cut lawn, more palm trees and a circular pool in the middle. The house itself is a two-story dwelling, also painted in bright yellow with white accents and double-paned windows with arched tops and red tile roof. In any large American city, this house would be a suburban, upper-middle class home -- but here in the town of Antunez, located in a mainly rural area of the Mexican southwestern state of Michoacan, it seems much grander, certainly in stark contrast with the adobe houses next door. ""This is now our barracks,"" says a vigilante who spoke to us on condition of anonymity. ""Some of our guys sleep and eat here. Some took the weapons that used to belong to the trafficker."" When we visited, half-a-dozen vigilantes stood guard outside. Our hosts are a group of local men who rose up in arms against the Knights Templar, a rather romantic name for a criminal organization known not only for drug trafficking, but also for terrorizing people in this part of Mexico through extortion, executions, rape and murder. The drug war in Mexico, which has been raging since former President Felipe Calderon started fighting back against the cartels in 2006, has claimed 100,000 lives. States like Michoacan are largely in the control of the cartels: 90 per cent of the cocaine that enters the U.S. does so through Mexico. The country is also a major supplier of marijuana, methamphetamine and, more recently, heroin. The mansion's owner, Efrain Isaac Rosales, also known as ""El Tucan"" (The Toucan), fled on January 10 when the town rose up in arms against him and his gunmen. They say he left so fast that he even abandoned some of his weapons in the house. Rosales is a lieutenant under the leadership of Servando Gomez, also known as ""La Tuta,"" the head of the Knights Templar cartel. Some 20 towns have been retaken from the drug gangs, according to the vigilantes, but Gomez, the former schoolteacher-turned-cartel leader, still holds a tight grip over Michoacan, ruling with intimidation and violence. He makes occasional public appearances, handing out money to the poor -- he considers himself an altruist -- and loudly trying to justify his presence in the state. ""[The Knights Templar] are a necessary evil,"" he once told an assembled crowd. ""Fortunately -- or unfortunately -- we are here. If we weren't, another group would come."" On a decorative opening in the foyer of his lieutenant's former residence, standing next to a modern art statue, is a mini 14, an assault rifle that fires .223-caliber bullets like an AR15, left behind by Rosales when he fled. This one had a 30-round magazine. The rifle sits next to a bulletproof vest. From the foyer, a hallway connects to a living area with a large, dark brown leather recliner in the middle. On the wall, there's a rack for a large flat screen TV; but the vigilante groups have looted the house already and many pieces of furniture are missing, giving the residence the feeling of a house whose owners have just moved out. It's still clean, with the exception of the bathrooms, but the beds are unmade and there are pieces of furniture and objects in odd places. The vigilantes are giving us access to what was believed to be Rosales' ""family home."" It's hard to miss that the house shares two walls with the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The church is also painted in similar colors: bright yellow and white. This is not the only property the vigilantes have occupied that used to belong to the cartel lieutenant. He also owned a nearby ranch called ""La Ilusion"" (The Illusion), which is surrounded by grapefruit trees and hundreds of hectares of avocado trees, the fruit of which has made the state of Michoacan known around the world. The vigilantes also confiscated a couple of vehicles that were left at the property: a white, late-model, Dodge Ram pickup truck and a modified truck painted matt black. The latter was fitted with half-inch steel plates and shooting portals in the double cabin and in the back. It had signs of having been in a shootout, riddled with bullet holes on the driver's side, the hood and the windshield. The property also features a shed with white pillars and red tile roof covering a living area with grills and chairs leading to the lawn connecting to the two-level circular pool divided in the middle. The vigilantes have been accused of looting the properties they have confiscated, and indeed some have been charged with excesses. But they are, by and large, treated as heroes by the people they have agreed to protect. A vigilante in the nearby town of La Huerta, who covers his face with a ski mask and identifies himself as ""Juan,"" says they say they had no option but to rise up in arms to protect their people and lands. ""If the government can't help you, you have to help yourself,"" Juan says. ""All we want to do is just pick up the arms so that we can drive them away. After that we're just going to put them down again."" Juan speaks English with a southern American accent. He says he lived in North Carolina from the time he was eight years old and returned to Mexico when he was 20. He's now 24 and a married father of two. The federal government's attitude towards the vigilante groups appears to be changing too. Once the army and police would round up the irregulars: now the authorities appear to want to legalize them, freeing them up to fight the cartels. Hipolito Mora, the leader of yet another vigilante group in the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, says they have kept the movement against organized crime with the same resources the Knights Templar used to attack them in the past. ""With the same resources that used to belong to the Knights Templar, their ranches and properties, we're financing this movement,"" Mora says. ""We did it at first and we continue to do so."" He remains philosophical about the dangers in which he has placed himself. ""I am not afraid. We are all going to die anyway."" The vigilantes are also returning property they say the Knights Templar stole from local people including ranches, lime orchards, wells, farming machinery and vehicles. The same morning we spoke to Mora, Grace Villa, a town resident, visited to personally thank him for allowing her and her family to recover their lime orchards. ""I think they're doing the right thing,"" Villa says, ""I think it was a very brave thing to do because they stood up for everybody."" Her family, Villa says, had to flee after 30 armed men showed up at their property demanding the title. ""They wanted to charge the people who picked lemons and they wanted to charge people who owned houses. The drug cartels were just sucking the money out of everybody and it was just going too far.""","The eight-year drugs war has claimed around 100,000 lives in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Hollywood heavies and other glitterati descend on Washington on Saturday night to light up the capital and lighten up the press corps. It's the annual White House correspondent's dinner. There's a red carpet, a presidential appearance, comedic relief and to make it all real, swanky after-parties. This year marks the 100th soiree, most of which have featured a fancy dinner and the president in attendance. In the early years, it was a small affair for 50. But in contemporary times, it has ballooned into a premier D.C. event at a huge hotel ballroom. CNN asked Julia Whiston, who serves as the dinner's executive director, when did it become such a mob scene, and why? ""Coincidentally, when I first started,"" she said and paused for effect, with a chuckle. It happened in 1993, she said. ""But it was because it was Bill Clinton's first dinner. They had a very large Hollywood following, and they wanted to be at the dinner."" The President tells jokes, a famous entertainer tells jokes, and reporters are called to the dais to collect awards. This year, CNN's Brianna Keilar will be recognized for some of her reporting on the Obama administration. Over the past two decades, it's become something of a Washington parlor game to see what news organization can snag the hottest movie stars, reality show personalities, pop singers and sports greats of the moment to be guests. Oh, and up-and-coming politicians or heavy-hitters in the Obama administration are good gets, too. This year, CNN employees will dine with actress Diane Lane, as well as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus on the right, as well as White House spokesman Josh Ernest and Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee on the left. But with the crush of bold-faced names from Hollywood getting bigger each year, Washingtonians have gotten increasingly star-struck. By the time the dinner arrives, well-known journalists rush for celeb autographs and selfies for their social media feeds. The dynamic led to the moniker ""Nerd Prom."" It's a title not everyone involved finds particularly affectionate, like Whiston. At 68, she says she still has energy to keep doing this job, and this will not be the last dinner she oversees. ""When I get that head table in, and they start to present the colors and the Marine Band starts playing, I think, 'this is not Kansas, this is pretty cool,'"" she said. She got the now-coveted job after several years running a similar -- but smaller -- press dinner. And every year since she began, demand has risen. That's especially true since Barack Obama became president, in part because he has an even bigger Hollywood following than the Clintons had during their White House years. Joel McHale, best known as host of E!'s satire show ""The Soup"" and star of NBC's comedy ""Community,"" is this year's host. He's excited about the honor, and even got some advice from some of the entertainers who came before him, which he shared with CNN's Jake Tapper. ""And it was ... all pretty much the same advice, which was, 'this will be the weirdest thing you ever do and it will be the most exhilarating thing you ever do ... And keep it short.'""","Annual White House Correspondent's Dinner is major soiree in nation's capital .

"(CNN) -- After more than eight hours of being kept at bay by severe weather and low visibility, helicopter rescue crews found a way to rescue four hikers stranded in a raging Southern California creek and ferry them to a waiting ambulance. ""The Ventura County sheriff's helicopter was able to break through the weather system, and has successfully hoisted all four of them out,"" Mike Parker, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, told CNN's ""New Day Sunday."" ""It was a very very risky rescue. It was quite a remote area. There's absolutely no lighting there at all. The only lighting that we had was our rescuers with flashlights on their helmets and the ones that they were holding,"" Parker said. ""In the pitch black, it's pretty difficult to find them. The creek was swollen and rising, and we were very concerned that they would be drowned where they were."" The rescue happened around 3 a.m. (6 a.m. ET). Rising water, slippery surfaces and the sheer rock walls of the gorge made matters difficult, Parker had said earlier. Before the decisive helicopter navigated through the skies, rescuers in rafts had been ""inching"" across Malibu Creek in a ""high risk"" attempt to reach the four, Parker said. Earlier in the morning, the batteries in the hikers' cell phone had died, but they were able to communicate that they saw the beams from the rescuers' flashlights, even though the rescuers could not see the hikers. About an hour before the rescue, the Malibu Search and Rescue helicopter made it through the foul weather that had delayed it and ""immediately spotted"" the hikers. They were about 200 yards upstream from the rescue team, Parker tweeted. In messages sent before their cell phone batteries died, the hikers said they were cold but not injured, Parker said. Temperatures overnight in the Malibu Creek Gorge were in the mid-40s, and rescuers were concerned that hypothermia might become an issue for the hikers, Parker tweeted. The hikers, from Long Beach, were believed to be in their mid-20s, Parker tweeted. 106 million in path of latest winter blast . Mandatory evacuation orders . Severe rain that soaked much of southern California has subsided in many Los Angeles suburbs, though residents of at least two communities remained under mandatory evacuation orders. Authorities lifted a mandatory evacuation order for Monrovia early Sunday, but others remained in effect for Glendora and Azusa, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. So far, no deaths have been reported as a result of the rain. ""We've got people still evacuated only because we expect those thunderstorms, those high-intensity, short duration type of rainstorms,"" Glendora Police Chief Timothy Staab told CNN affiliate KCAL Saturday night. ""The hillsides are already soaked right now, and it may not take much to cause those mudslides to just come down out of the hills."" The hills can't absorb water because so much vegetation was destroyed in wildfires and drought. Walls of water have gushed into valleys below. They have spewed mud and debris into quiet residential streets, turning them into thick, brown creeks. ""These areas have the highest risk of being impacted by flooding/debris flows from rainfall due to the loss of vegetation from the foothills,"" the city of Glendora said in a statement to KABC, also a CNN affiliate. Little drought relief despite downpour . The storms brought the first rains since the collapse of a powerful, persistent weather system that was keeping California parched, but they won't do much to alleviate the drought, according to the CNN Weather Center. A lot of the water is flowing out to sea, and the drought's effects have been enormous. Water reservoirs are running at minimum levels. CNN's Greg Morrison and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Hikers rescued from swollen creek in Southern California .

"(CNN) -- Australian scientists have dated a star thought to be the oldest yet discovered, and it's right in our neighborhood -- astronomically speaking. The star, which has been given the name SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, is thought by a team of astronomers at the Australia National University to be 13.6 billion years old. The star itself is not a new discovery -- it is faintly visible on existing photographic maps of the southern sky. But the recent dating places it as older than any other celestial body previously found. The star is part of our Milky Way galaxy and only around 6,000 light years from Earth, relatively close in astronomical terms. Stefan Keller, a research fellow at ANU's Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, published the findings in the scientific journal Nature. ""Stars act as time capsules,"" Keller told CNN. ""This one took a little sample of the universe at the time that is was formed ... and means we can study [what the early universe was like] in great detail."" The discovery of the star's age -- which dates it at only a hundred million years younger than scientific estimates of the age of the universe itself -- is significantly older than any previously dated stars. The oldest celestial bodies discovered thus far have been 13.2 billion years old. Keller and his team used the SkyMapper telescope to find ancient stars as part of an ongoing project to produce the first digital map of the southern sky. The team used a technique for imaging stars to ascertain how much iron was present -- the younger a star, the greater the amounts of iron it had. The SkyMapper telescope is unique in its ability to find stars with low iron, which uses sophisticated filters to measure the color of the stars, a key indicator of iron levels. ""The stars we are finding number one in a million,"" said team member Mike Bessell on the University's website. The team looked at 60 million stars and narrowed down potential candidates to a shortlist of 200, which were examined using the Magellan telescope in Chile. It is an important cosmological discovery, as it tells researchers a great deal about the origin of the elements that make up the universe. Keller said that most stars created in the early stages of the universe died in ""extremely violent explosions,"" and that it is unlikely that more stars of a similar age will be found.","A 13.6 billion-year-old star has been dated by Australian astronomers .

"(CNN) -- While Spain wallows in the doldrums of economic despondency and political turmoil, with youth unemployment at eye-watering levels and Catalan separatists threatening to tear away at the country's seams, there is one place where its stock has never been higher. On the motorcycling track, 2013's calendar is a parade of Iberian supremacy, with Spaniards dominating every race class to the almost complete exclusion of other nations. At the forefront of this is MotoGP's newly-crowned champion: a 20-year-old whose debut season in the elite division has delighted even the most jaded observers of this most daring of motorsports. Marc Marquez has exploded onto the scene like a grinning Catherine wheel, redefining the expectations of rookie riders and cocking a gleeful snook at the establishment, leaving dazed rivals scratching their heads in disbelief. After a bizarre disqualification at the Australian Grand Prix threatened his commanding lead in the championship, Marquez kept his head with two remarkably mature displays of disciplined riding -- first in Japan and then during a frenzied final race at Spain's Valencia circuit, to take a richly deserved title. As the youngest champion in the history of top-level motorcycling, known by his Catalan fans as ""the Thunder from Cervera,"" he has a vividly bright future. Someone who knows all about the challenges of being a MotoGP rookie is James Toseland, who spent two tough seasons riding for the satellite Yamaha Team after making the step up from Superbikes, where he was a double world champion. Now touring with his rock band and preparing for an attempt at the world two-wheeled land speed record, Toseland is a big admirer of Marquez and believes his youth is actually an advantage. ""It just happens as a 20-year-old,"" said Toseland, who returned to Superbikes before a wrist injury ended his racing career in 2011. ""All you're seeing is a young kid; he doesn't understand the mechanics of the bike so well yet, or the people he's racing against -- all he's doing is putting his helmet on, putting his leathers on, cocking his leg over that bike and absolutely wringing its neck, with the confidence of what he's achieved previously in Moto2 and the old 125 cc class."" 'Nobody can do something like that' Herve Poncharal, principal of the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 team and leader of the IRTA group that represents MotoGP's teams, told CNN that Marquez served early notice of his special talent. ""I remember one of his last races in the old 125 class, in Portugal,"" he said. ""The race was shortened to something like five or seven laps. He crashed on the warmup and he had to start from the pit lane because he pitted to have his bike fixed, so he started dead last, and quite a lot after the last row, but he won that race. ""He won the championship that year, and from that moment we thought, 'Nobody can do something like that.' "" Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of Dorna -- the organization that runs MotoGP -- was struck by the way Marquez immediately looked at home in the top class. ""His personality is really important,"" Ezpeleta told CNN. ""He's somebody who arrived to the championship as a hero, kind of saying, 'I'm here, I want to be here.' ""Immediately when he arrived in the top class he started coming to the MotoGP executive commission with the other riders, and immediately he wanted to hear and give his opinions; he's a great talent but also a great personality."" Fresh attitude . This vibrant personality is one of the key reasons many see Marquez as the natural successor to Italy's charismatic seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi. The Spaniard's smiling demeanor has not only won him fans off the track, it also appears to have helped guide him through the stresses of the MotoGP season. ""He brings so much energy, such a fresh way of behaving, a fresh mind, enthusiasm,"" Poncharal told CNN. ""In Australia (after Marquez was controversially disqualified) Jorge Lorenzo, Dani Pedrosa or Valentino Rossi would have left the track and been very long faced. Marc was on a crate, while everyone was packing, eating some crisps, and laughing with his crew. ""He's always in the paddock. Although the other guys are walking to and from their motorhome and the box, in between the two they have their sunglasses and their headphones on and are not talking to anybody. Marc is always there, anything that is happening in the paddock he's there. ""The attitude of this guy is a big bonus for our championship and it's so good to see a top guy who is still going out and playing with the Moto3 guys, and being available for anyone."" The almost universal affection for Marquez has also given last season's champion Lorenzo -- who missed out by four points this time despite winning Sunday's final race -- pause for thought. ""Mother nature didn't gift Lorenzo the way she gifted Marquez,"" Poncharal said. ""On the riding he can compete with Marquez and he's showing that every weekend, but Marc is so much more appreciated by everyone because of his nature, and Marc instantly makes you feel at home with him; he inspires sympathy, and not everybody has got that. ""And I think Jorge is trying very hard to change his image, which is not as likeable as Marc's, but this is something that is not easy to change."" Personality with great talent . Ezpeleta recognizes the importance of Marquez's personality, but says it is important not to overlook his talent. ""The most important thing is to be a very good rider,"" he said. ""Rossi, (Casey) Stoner, Lorenzo, Pedrosa and other riders have put the championship at an incredible level, and I think one of the assets of Marc is that he has been beating people like Lorenzo and Pedrosa, who are really great, great riders. ""Of course the personality is important, but just the personality is not enough -- it needs to be the personality together with a great, great rider."" Toseland believes the crew in Marquez's Repsol Honda garage deserve credit for their approach to blooding the young star. ""They've employed a young kid and nurtured him,"" he said. ""They will have put the settings on the bike to where they will see the data and the electronics -- on how he's opening the throttle up and how he's riding -- and they will have given him a bit of a safety net at first, because there's a massive power difference between Moto2 and MotoGP. ""Then they would have gradually opened up the power, decreased the traction control, the anti-wheelie control, all the settings you can change on a bike, to build his confidence."" Marquez was allowed to go straight into a factory MotoGP team -- Repsol Honda -- at an age that was previously prohibited by the sport's so-called ""rookie rule."" It was scrapped last year, having been introduced in 2010 to spread riding talent around the satellite teams. Toseland believes this has been significant, and that other stars have also helpfully aligned to smooth Marquez's path to success. ""To join one of the best teams, with what looks like the best bike this year -- and with Lorenzo and Pedrosa both injuring themselves and missing a race early in the year -- for him to then get the confidence of actually learning how to win, and getting a couple of wins under his belt, all those factors put into the pot have just made him so confident in what he's doing,"" he said. ""You can see when he's on track that he's not fazed by anything or anyone, from the confidence he's got from having that little bit of breathing space earlier in the year."" The next big chapter? Poncharal believes that Marquez would have achieved success even without a factory bike. ""At the moment he has the lot, he's on what feels like the best bike, which is for sure a bonus, although Lorenzo is showing us that the Yamaha is not so bad,"" he said. ""But, and this is just my opinion, I'm not so sure that (on a satellite Honda) he would have done a lot less."" As well as winning friends with his smiling demeanor and openness off the track, Marquez has also caught the eye with his audacious riding style, which sees his elbow as well as his knee pressing down on the track through corners. This enables him to better gauge what both the front and the rear of the bike are doing, providing a ""fourth wheel"" to help him get around faster. Other riders have begun to mimic this spectacular and effective technique. Toseland is among many startled by this evolution, and puts it partly down to advances in racing tires. ""I used to get my elbow down with qualifying tires, and that's what it's all about really -- it's the tire technology, Bridgestone have obviously developed a tire with the edge grip now that enables the bike to lean over that far, and also enable you to lean off the bike that much with the confidence that the grip is there,"" he said. ""It's not just Marquez now, you see others like Stefan Bradl and Jorge Lorenzo with their elbows down. It's not so much that they've changed their style, it's the tire is allowing the bike to lean over that far."" They might be able to follow him, but can anyone can catch Marquez next year? ""It's always difficult to say, 'He's going to be the greatest of all time,' "" Poncharal said. ""But clearly if you remember the last 40 years you have Kenny Roberts, then you have the Mick Doohan era, you have the Valentino Rossi era, and I think Marc is ready, if nothing bad happens to him, to write another big chapter of MotoGP history.""","Marc Marquez has impressed with his demeanor as well as his success on the track .

"(CNN) -- Could search crews be just a few hundred feet from solving a mystery that has riveted millions for 76 years? That's the question raised by tantalizing evidence published this week by teams trying to find out what happened to famed aviator Amelia Earhart, who vanished along with navigator Fred Noonan during a doomed attempt to fly around the world in 1937. Yet that evidence has been met with skepticism in some quarters. Debate about the mystery gained new currency this week after researchers publicized images recorded by search teams scanning the ocean floor nearly a year ago near Nikumaroro Island in the South Pacific. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery raised the prospect of a big break in the case by publishing an image online. It showed something -- hard for the layman to size up -- on the ocean floor. The group said, ""It's the right size, it's the right shape and it's in the right place."" Could it really be a piece of Earhart's Lockheed Electra plane? Louise Foudray, caretaker and historian of the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum in Atchison, Kansas, chose her words carefully on Friday afternoon. ""We don't want to shrug off the hard work anyone is doing. We do like the idea that people are still interested,"" she said. ""But we're skeptical."" Opinion: Will mystery of Earhart be solved? She said there have been other theories that have emerged. One is that Earhart's plane was forced down by the Japanese around the Marshall Islands. Another is that Earhart secretly returned to the United States and the government gave her a new identity. There are people out there who buy those theories. But in reality, Foudray said, ""no one has yet to come up with anything conclusive."" It wasn't until March that one analyst made a possible connection to Earhart in an online forum for the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery. The group said experts have offered various interpretations. Some think the sonar image could be a man-made object, and others say it could be a geologic feature. Earhart: The evidence we almost lost . ""So did (last summer's) expedition actually succeed in locating the wreckage of the world's most famous missing airplane? Or is this sonar target just a coral rock or ridge?"" the organization says on its website. ""Of course we're not going to know until we can get back out there, but until then the anomaly is worth close study."" Richard Fredricks, executive director of the American Salvage Association, a trade group, said that ""almost anything is possible"" these days with advanced technology. And that includes locating a lost airplane. He cited technology such as side-scan sonar and magnetometers but said finding a lost plane such as the Earhart craft is ""more a function of funding than technology."" Money is needed to invest in expeditions, he said. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery on its website is asking for contributions to continue its work. Foudray said she's heard all of the evidence and nothing solid has risen to the surface. And that includes the latest foray into the South Pacific deep. ""We don't expect anything,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- During the Arab Spring, Hillary Clinton heralded Al-Jazeera's coverage of momentous events in Egypt in 2011. ""Like it or hate it, it is really effective,"" Clinton said of the network at a congressional hearing while she was secretary of state. She went on to decry ""a million commercials"" and ""arguments between talking heads,"" and ""the kind of stuff that we do on our news that is not providing information to us."" The remarks primarily pointed out the growing influence Al-Jazeera was having on American viewers. But behind that, Clinton's testimony was a top-down critique of U.S. media. ""Her comments went to the heart of the way the media structure works,"" Brian Stelter, host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" said. And for her, they are again quite relevant. Hillary Clinton is thinking about running for president, a candidacy -- and possible administration -- that would no doubt intensify the already close and sometimes sensational scrutiny of her and her husband. For Bill and Hillary Clinton, their view on the state of journalism in the United States comes from a place of deep knowledge and exposure. And like many who have been in the spotlight for a prolonged period, it's a love-hate thing. Bill Clinton speaks out . A focus of national media speculation, debate and fascination for 25 years, their relationship with the press has ebbed and flowed. But on the whole, they have long questioned and doubted its motives. And over the past two weeks, both Clintons have let it be known those feelings still exist. On Wednesday at his alma mater, Georgetown University, Bill Clinton faulted journalists for how they covered policy issues, saying it is ""dimly understood"" and often ""disconnected from the consequences of the policies being implemented"" because of journalists. Bill Clinton plays professor, blasts media in Georgetown speech . ""If a policymaker is a political leader and is covered primarily by the political press, there is a craving that borders on addictive to have a storyline,"" said Clinton as his wife looked on. ""And then once people settle on the storyline, there is a craving that borders on blindness to shoehorn every fact, every development, everything that happens into the story line, even if it's not the story."" Last week, Hillary Clinton leveled an equally biting media critique, telling an audience at the University of Connecticut that ""journalism has changed quite a bit in a way that is not good for the country and not good for journalism."" Hillary Clinton: Today's media is more entertainment, less facts . ""A lot of serious news reporting has become more entertainment driven and more opinion-driven as opposed to factual,"" she said. ""People book onto the shows, political figures, commentators who will be controversial who will be provocative because it's a good show. You might not learn anything but you might be entertained and I think that's just become an unfortunate pattern that I wish could be broken."" Common for politicians . This feeling among politicians is par for the course, said Paul Begala, a longtime Clinton confidant who attended Wednesday's speech. ""It is an occupational hazard and it comes with the territory,"" said Begala, a CNN contributor. ""I don't think it is any different for him than it was with President Obama, President Bush or President Reagan."" Stelter echoed that sentiment. ""If you put (either of the Clinton's quotes) in front of either President Bush, they would agree with most of the comments."" From Whitewater to draft-dodging allegations to Monica Lewinsky, the media spotlight on the Clintons during their time in the White House was intense, and it affected them. For most of the eight years of the Clinton administration from 1993-2001, the couple and their advisers worried about the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" that they feared aimed to take them down. According to Clinton Library documents released by the National Archives, those feelings largely stemmed from the rise of the Internet and conservative blogs and chat rooms. The late Diane Blair, a longtime Clinton confidant and friend, kept a detailed diary of her exchanges with the first lady. According to Blair, whose personal documents gained media attention earlier this year, Clinton regularly expressed frustration and a deep distrust of the media. Confidant's diary: Clinton wanted to keep records for 'revenge' In January 1995, Blair wrote that Clinton expressed ""her total exasperation with all this obsession and attention, and how hard she's finding to conceal her contempt for it all."" The most apparent next flashpoint on the relationship between the media and the Clintons came during Hillary's 2008 race for the White House. Late into the Democratic primary process as it became clear that Barack Obama had the momentum, the Clinton campaign's view of the media began to sour. The former President publicly and privately railed against what he called ""the most biased coverage in history,"" and both Clintons complained of what they believed to be a pervasive sexism dominating the campaign narrative. Bill Clinton even publicly called one campaign reporter ""sleazy"" and ""a really dishonest reporter."" What's ahead? Now with Hillary Clinton admittedly ""thinking"" about a 2016 run, the question remains as to how her relationship with the media -- and its deep history -- could affect any campaign. Stelter thinks these latest tweaks of the media could be an attempt to ""work the refs."" ""The Clintons have been choosing to go there,"" concluded Stelter. ""I do think one partial explanation has to do with any future campaign that we may see from Hillary Clinton.""","Suspicions of the media by the Clintons is nothing new .
But there's new relevancy with Hillary Clinton thinking about a White House run .
The two have made comments recently critical of news coverage ."
"(CNN) -- Sunday is a day of mourning in Afghanistan for the victims of two landslides that turned a village into a mass grave last week. TV and radio stations suspended the broadcast of entertainment programming to commemorate Friday's tragedy. The first landslide, triggered by heavy rain, swallowed 300 to 400 homes in the Argo district of Badakhshan province in northeastern Afghanistan, where an estimated 2,700 people lived, authorities said. When as many as 600 people from a nearby village came to help dig people out, another landslide swept through, burying most, if not all, of the rescuers, according to provincial governor Shah Waliullah Adeeb. The governor's office said at least 2,000 people died in all. Efforts are now focused on about 4,000 survivors and evacuees. United Nations humanitarian groups are rounding up food, water and medical supplies. A NATO team is sending a C-130 transport plane from Kabul airport with supplies, including tents and blankets, officials say. Afghans are also donating to charities to help the victims. Hamim Jalalzai, an Afghan journalist, said on Facebook that he was part of a group of people who went from shop to shop in Kabul, taking up donations. Meteorologists warn that potential rain forecast for Monday and Tuesday could further hamper rescue efforts and trigger another landslide. Michael Martinez, Yousuf Basil and Qadir Sediqi contributed to this story.","NEW: TV and radio suspend entertainment programming to mourn victims of landslides .

"(CNN) -- On her second full day of a week-long goodwill tour in China, Michelle Obama lauded study abroad as a key part of U.S. foreign policy and encouraged students from all walks of life to consider joining the growing corps of citizen diplomats such study fosters. ""I'm here today because I know that our future depends on connections like these among young people like you across the globe,"" the first lady told an audience composed of Chinese and international students at Peking University. ""We believe that relationships between nations aren't just about relationships between governments or leaders -- they're about relationships between people, particularly young people."" Immersion in another country's culture does more than help a student's job prospects, she said. ""It's also about shaping the future of your countries and of the world we all share. Because, when it comes to the defining challenges of our time --- whether it's climate change or economic opportunity or the spread of nuclear weapons -- these are shared challenges. And no one country can confront them alone. The only way forward is together."" She noted that China is the fifth most popular destination for Americans studying abroad, and that the Chinese represent the highest number of exchange students in the United States. Obama, who grew up in a working-class family, said that as a student she never considered studying abroad and noted that many young people struggling to pay for school today may also feel that way. ""That's not acceptable, because study abroad shouldn't just be for students from certain backgrounds,"" she said. She quoted Philmon Haile, a University of Washington student who moved with his family from Eritrea to the United States as refugees when he was a child and then studied in China. ""He said, 'Study abroad is a powerful vehicle for people-to-people exchange as we move into a new era of citizen diplomacy.'"" The technology revolution has changed the game, she noted. ""You don't need to get on a plane to be a citizen diplomat,"" she said. ""If you have an Internet connection in your home, school or library, within seconds you can be transported anywhere in the world and meet people on every continent."" She added that the battle of ideas that can result from such interaction ""can be a messy and frustrating process,"" but said it was a critical one. ""Because time and again, we have seen that countries are stronger and more prosperous when the voices of and opinions of all their citizens can be heard."" Obama's remarks came a day after she -- accompanied by her daughters and her mother -- visited a Beijing high school accompanied by China's first lady, Peng Liyuan. She met with students at the public school as well as with 33 American students from a U.S.-based School Year Abroad program, which costs $50,000 per year and occupies the sixth floor of one of the school's buildings. More than half of the 250 students at its schools in China, France, Spain and Italy receive ""some sort of need-based aid,"" said SYA President Jack Creeden, in a telephone interview. ""The average award is $26,000."" Obama's schedule does not include a news conference, and she is not expected to answer questions from professional reporters during the trip. But on Saturday, she answered several of the more than 300 questions filed by CNN iReporters about studying abroad and international travel. They will be posted Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, she will answer questions submitted by U.S. classrooms as part of a webinar series by Discovery Education and the White House.

"New York (CNN) -- New York City has agreed to pay $100,000 to a Brooklyn man whose beating by police officers was caught on surveillance video, the city law department said Tuesday. The incident occurred on October 8, 2012, after police received a call about a dispute at the ALIYA Institute in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, police said. There, police came upon Ehud Halevy, 22, who refused to leave the women's portion of the center. The community center surveillance video, obtained by CNN from the website CrownHeights.info, showed two officers beating Halevy with punches after he allegedly resisted arrest. The police department's Internal Affairs Bureau Investigated the incident but eventually cleared both officers of wrongdoing, according to Halevy's lawyer, Norman Siegel. The settlement ends the lawsuit Halevy filed against the city in January 2013. In addition to the $100,000, the city will also pay Halevy's attorney's fees, which are still being negotiated, Siegel said. ""This civil rights action was brought in response to the violent acts of police abuse against Mr. Halevy and a violation of his civil rights,"" Siegel told CNN. ""Hopefully, this horrific action by NYPD officers will never happen to anyone again."" The graphic video shows a bare-chested, bearded Halevy talking with two officers -- one of them a woman -- in what appears to be a game room containing a pool table and two couches. The video shows the officers approaching Halevy, who is on one of the couches, and talking to him. Moments later, he stands and talks with the officers, gesticulating with his arms but making no apparent threat toward either officer. The video has no sound. When the officers attempt to grab him by his arms, Halevy pulls free of their grasp. The male officer crouches into a boxing stance and hits the victim more than a dozen times, striking him in the face, the back of his head and his torso. Halevy falls back into a couch, where he raises his arms in an apparent attempt to deflect the blows, but at no point does it appear that he is seeking to strike either officer. Later in the video, the female officer can be seen striking Halevy repeatedly with a truncheon. More than three minutes into the video, about 10 more officers enter the room, where they cuff Halevy's wrists behind his back and lead him out. According to a spokesman from the city law department, the ""settlement was in the best interest of all parties.""","Police beating of Ehud Halevy in Brooklyn was caught on video .

"(CNN) -- If you're of the opinion that the only thing better than viewing great art is owning it, put these destinations on your travel itinerary. Not only are they cities renowned for their beauty, their museums and their architecture, they are the sites of the world's great art fairs. From ancient objects to art that was conceived yesterday, these carefully curated fairs offer the best of the best to their audiences. Attending one is like walking through a museum where everything is for sale -- to anyone with adequate funds. Yet even if you're not equipped to buy, you can still visit these fairs, take part in the spectacle and feed your aspirations. 5 train stations worth a stop . Maastricht, The Netherlands . Held annually in Maastricht, the European Fine Art Fair is the art fair by which all others are measured. ""There is no other fair like it,"" says Lawrence Steigrad, a New York City fine art dealer who specializes in Old Master paintings. At the fair in March, he sold an 1810 painting by Dutch artist Nicolaas Baur to the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. That's the level of ""shopper"" who attends this fair: museum curators, serious collectors and those who aspire to be serious collectors. Calvin Klein and Kanye West are among those who have been spotted at the invitation-only preview day in recent years. They come because the quality and authenticity of every piece -- from antiquities to contemporary art -- undergoes what is acknowledged in the art world to be the strictest vetting process of any art fair. After the preview day, the fair is open to all. The ticket price is considerable, but the chance to see and possibly purchase such art, antiques and objects is extraordinary. The next fair takes place March 14-23, 2014, and there's talk of launching a TEFAF Beijing fair as well. Maastricht, in the southern Netherlands near Belgium, is known as a place where Amsterdam residents go for a weekend break. The cafes and restaurants around Vrijthof Square are lively and comfortable. Selexyz Dominicanen, housed in a former Dominican church, is one of the world's most beautiful bookstores, and the Bonnefantenmuseum is an excellent place to see art all year round. The places where masterpieces are born . London . Ever since its debut four years ago, Masterpiece London has been gaining a reputation as a mini-TEFAF. Installed in a specially built pavilion on the grounds of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London, Masterpiece specializes in fine art, antiques and design, and adds luxury goods -- cars, yachts, watches and wines -- to the mix of offerings. Everything is vetted, everything is expensive, and Prince Harry was one of the VIP attendees in 2011. The list of exhibitors is hovering around 200 for this year's fair, which will take place June 26-July 3. Yet the even newer fair that everyone's talking about now is Frieze Masters, an adjunct to Frieze London, both of which will take place October 17-20. While Frieze London showcases contemporary art, Frieze Masters, which premiered in 2012, is for everything pre-21st-century. Last year's exhibitors included 90 international dealers; attendees included curators from around the world; and sales included ancient Mesopotamian artifacts, Renaissance marbles, a couple of Picassos and a Joan MirÃÂ³ painting with an eight-figure asking price. When you're in London, it's never hard to find great art to visit at the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Tate Modern the British Museum or the Royal Academy of Arts. Put the London Transport Museum on your list as well. Its ""Poster Art 150 -- London Underground's Greatest Designs"" exhibition (through October 27) features art that everyone can understand. Gatsby's Gold Coast: 8 grand estates . Venice . There are other biennial international art exhibitions, but when people talk about ""the Biennale,"" they're talking about Venice. This being an odd-numbered year, the city is preparing the 55th Venice Biennale -- a nearly six-month-long festival (June 1 to November 24) with pavilions and art installations throughout the city. An architecture Biennale runs in even-numbered years. The Biennale seeps into every nook and cranny of the city, and the year won't be the only odd thing about it. For artists, the chance to represent their countries at the Venice Biennale can be a career-making moment. The path to greatness isn't easy, however, and neither is the art, which is typically conceptual, avant-garde and often (not to put too fine a point on it) just plain weird. Of the 88 nations represented by national pavilions, 10 are exhibiting for the first time. One is Bahamian artist Tavares Strachan whose installation includes a re-enactment of Robert Peary's 1909 expedition to the North Pole. The installation by Vincent J.F. Huang, representing Tuvalu (another first-time participant) involves suicidal penguins. Sarah Sze will represent the United States with an installation called ""Triple Point."" Chinese artist Ai Weiwei is one of four international artists who will create the installation in the German pavilion. At times, it can seem that the Biennale is inescapable. Whether that's good or bad depends on your taste. If, after seeing the newest of the new, you're longing for a cleansing immersion in classical or decorative art, the 11 museums of the Fondazione Musei Civici Venezia will satisfy you. Basel, Switzerland . When it comes to art fairs that truly put their cities on the map, Art Basel tops the list. In 1970, three Basel gallery owners joined forces and invited their ""gallerist"" colleagues to Basel to exhibit the works of their current clients. Ninety galleries from 10 countries exhibited, more than 16,000 people attended, and with that one bold move, Basel became a modern and contemporary art pilgrimage destination. The 2012 Art Basel saw 300 galleries from 36 countries exhibiting and more than 65,000 curators and collectors attending. It's a happening -- and no one who's passionate about contemporary art would miss it. Art Basel is limited to 20th and 21st century art, and the emphasis is on the new. So, yes, you'll see Warhol and the occasional Leger, but you're more likely to encounter Cindy Sherman, Phyllida Barlow, Edward Ruscha, and Takashi Murakami among the offerings (and possibly among the attendees). In addition to the gallery exhibitors, there are installations of site-specific artworks open to the public free of charge in the Art Parcours section of the fair. The next Art Basel takes place June 13-16, 2013. With 40 museums to serve a population of around 165,000, Basel rightly claims the title of Switzerland's culture capital. Recently, Kunstmuseum Basel has been welcoming crowds for its excellent Picasso retrospective (through July 21). In nearby Weil am Rhein, Germany, the Vitra Design Museum is celebrating the work of American architect Louis Kahn (through August 11). Just as thrilling to locals and sports fans alike, the local soccer team, FC Basel, was the defending Swiss champion until they were defeated on Monday by Zurich-based club Grasshopper for the Swiss Cup title. Miami Beach, Florida . It's not really cheating to include Art Basel Miami Beach on this list. Yes, the show is an offshoot of the original in Switzerland, but as it approaches its 12th year, Art Basel Miami Beach has earned its stripes in the art community -- and not merely because it gives everyone an excuse to visit Florida in the winter. (The even newer Art Basel Hong Kong kicks off its inaugural show this month, from May 23 to 26.) Held at the Miami Beach Convention Center, Art Basel Miami Beach features more than 200 exhibitors showcasing the work of some 4,000 artists and competition to be included is fierce -- close to 700 galleries applied to show at Art Basel Miami Beach last year. As at the original Art Basel, the focus here is on the new, but in Miami Beach, there's emphasis on artists and galleries from the United States and Latin America. The Art Nova and Art Positions sections of the fair showcase recent works, and young and emerging artists. The Art Public section, organized in cooperation with the Bass Museum of Art, places art installations in Collins Park. The next Art Basel Miami Beach takes place December 5-8. Miami and Miami Beach have a number of private art collections open to the public. The Rubell Family Collection is among the world's most respected private collections, featuring works by top 20th century artists and burgeoning contemporary artists. The Margulies Collection at the Warehouse includes works by Olafur Eliasson, Sol LeWitt, Willem de Kooning and Richard Serra. And in 2009, Carlos and Rosa de la Cruz opened the de la Cruz Collection Contemporary Art Space to showcase their collection of contemporary art.","Maastricht, Netherlands, hosts one of the world's most prestigious art events .

"(CNN) -- A federal jury ruled Friday that Samsung must pay $119.6 million more to Apple over patent infringements, according to court documents filed by the U.S. District Court of Northern District of California, San Jose division. The ruling is the latest development in the long-running legal battle between the two tech giants. While certainly not insignificant, Friday's decision was by no means a total victory for Apple: The Cupertino, California-based company had actually sought a much higher sum from Samsung, and the jury only sided with it on two of the four patent infringements that it claimed. And according to the court documents, Apple must pay Samsung more than $158,000 for patent infringement accusations filed by the Korean smartphone maker. In a statement, Apple said the latest ruling ""reinforces what courts around the world have already found: that Samsung willfully stole our ideas and copied our products."" ""We are fighting to defend the hard work that goes into beloved products like the iPhone, which our employees devote their lives to designing and delivering for our customers,"" the company said. This decision marks another -- and almost definitely not the final -- chapter in the years-long fight between Apple and Samsung. The two companies are embroiled in dozens of patent disputes in courts around the world. Apple has typically been the aggressor in alleging Samsung of ""slavishly"" copying aspects of its iPhone and iPad technology, though Samsung has levied a few patent infringement accusations of its own. In August 2012, Samsung was found to have violated several of Apple's patents, and a jury ruled that Samsung owed Apple more than $1 billion in damages. U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh later said that the jury miscalculated the award, and about $450 million worth of those damages were reconsidered in a new trial. Then, last November, a federal jury ordered Samsung to pay $290 million in damages on top of the $640 million in damages that Judge Koh upheld.

"(CNN) -- Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the former business partners and Harvard University classmates of  Mark Zuckerberg, have dropped their court appeal of a settlement with the Facebook founder. The Winklevosses had claimed they were shortchanged in a $65 million settlement with Zuckerberg because Facebook had misrepresented the value of company stock. In April, a federal appeals judge rejected the argument and ruled the twins could not unwind the legally binding agreement they had signed in 2008. The brothers and a third partner, Divya Narendra, had wanted to reverse that ruling and were willing to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. But in documents filed Wednesday with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, they said they will not pursue the matter any longer. ""We've considered this case closed for a long time, and we're pleased to see the other party now agrees,"" Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said in a statement. Facebook's long-running battle with the Winklevoss brothers was a key plot point in ""The Social Network,"" a 2010 fictionalized movie dramatization of the company's origins. In late 2003, the Winklevosses and Narendra asked Zuckerberg to help them write the coding for a social networking site they were developing for Harvard and other campuses. Zuckerberg entered into an oral agreement and was made a partner. In February 2004, however, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, which he later renamed Facebook. The Winklevosses and Narendra filed suit later that year against Facebook and Zuckerberg. The trio alleged that Zuckerberg had stolen the idea for Facebook from them. Facebook promptly countersued the trio and their own social networking site, ConnectU, alleging they had hacked into Facebook to steal data and spam users. A California court ordered the parties to mediate the dispute, and according to court records, they signed an agreement in which the Winklevosses would give up ConnectU for cash and a share in Facebook stock. The Winklevosses and Narendra later tried to pull out of the deal, alleging that Facebook had undervalued its stock, thus rendering the agreement as having been procured fraudulently. A judge ruled against them and forced the settlement to go through, but the Winklevosses and Narendra appealed . In April, U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, ruled against them. ""At some point, litigation must come to an end,"" Kozinski concluded. ""That point has now been reached.""

"(CNN) -- He came from Brazil to leading Spanish club Barcelona in a mega-bucks transfer touted as the new Lionel Messi. A series of niggling injuries this season put paid to any hope of Neymar living up to those high expectations, while the tax issues surrounding his complicated transfer from Santos cast a shadow over his new career in Europe. But the Brazilian, who has managed just nine league goals for Barcelona since touching down in Catalonia, is quick to rule out any correlation -- as some have done -- between those off-field issues and his form in a ""Blaugrana"" shirt this season. Which will be a relief to Brazil given how important Neymar is to their team and its hopes of winning the World Cup on home soil. ""No, I don't think [it has affected my performances]. I'm used to leaving all those problems aside, I'm very relaxed when it comes to that,"" said Neymar, who was talking to CNN at a Castrol Footkhana event. ""It's unpleasant when everyone is talking about things that are not true, but on the pitch it doesn't get in the way."" True or not Neymar's club is being investigated over tax fraud regarding the transfer -- which Barcelona was forced to confirm actually totaled 86.2 million euros rather than the 57.1 million euros first announced -- while Sandro Rosell had to step down from his role as president as controversy over the deal intensified. Neymar's former club Santos, meanwhile, is unhappy with how the transfer fee was divided up -- with a large chunk having been paid to a company controlled by the player's father, Neymar Snr -- and has been seeking a bigger cut than the 17.1 million euros it originally received. Earlier this year Santos president Odilio Rodrigues reportedly criticized Neymar's father calling the deal he did with Barcelona ""unacceptable."" ""I was very sad by the way that Santos handled this problem,"" Neymar, who has previously defended his father's role in the deal, said. ""We hadn't done anything wrong. ""The way that Santos handled this left me very sad, but what are you going to do? I can't answer for them, but I can speak for myself and my dad and say that we were truly saddened by how they wanted to resolve this."" Santos was the club that molded Neymar into the player he is today. Making his debut in 2009 at the age of just 17 -- after coming through the youth ranks -- he helped lead the side to South American Copa Libertadores glory in 2011. ""What I lived at Santos will stay with me for the rest of my life, they were wonderful years where I made history. I think that won't be erased,"" he said. ""I'm sad with the board, I'm sad with who was in presidency -- with those I am upset. With the club, the fans, the players? No. ""I have a lot of love for Santos, because it was a club where I was for 10 years, so my love will always be great."" Like Neymar, Barcelona have had an up and down season, losing the Spanish Copa del Rey final to rivals Real Madrid and crashing out of the European Champions League at the quarterfinal stage, while a Spanish La Liga title looks unlikely. Neymar, though, insists he is enjoying life at the Camp Nou, which brings with it the privilege of playing alongside one of the finest players in the world -- Messi. ""Everything is going really well, I'm very happy in this city,"" he said. ""[Messi and I] haven't played all the games together but I think that the affinity that we have, that we've been creating, is very good. The relationship that we have, it's been wonderful. ""Some people were saying we wouldn't get along, and that's been shown as being the opposite. He's a very relaxed guy, he's someone that I admire a lot."" Despite the difficulties he has faced at Barcelona, Neymar still has the chance to achieve what could ultimately be his career's crowning glory. In six weeks' time, the 22-year-old and his Brazil teammates will step out onto the Arena de Sao Paulo field to open the 2014 World Cup against Croatia. The world's most successful footballing nation will be attempting to land the sport's biggest prize in its own backyard for the first time, roared on by an expectant set of supporters. ""It's a dream that is about to happen and I hope that dream that I've always had, also happens with winning the title,"" said Neymar, who led Brazil to Confederations Cup glory in 2013 having been named player of the tournament in the process. ""It's a dream to put on the Brazil shirt, even more so at a World Cup in my own country. For me it's a great satisfaction."" Winning the World Cup in front of its own supporters would help banish the memories of the nation's darkest sporting hour -- letting slip a lead to allow Uruguay to become world champions in 1950, the last time the tournament was held in Brazil. Neymar, the national team's poster boy, is well aware of the pressure being piled on the shoulders of him and his teammates, especially given that they won the Confederations Cup in front of their own supporters last year. But the Barcelona man, who has represented his country on 48 occasions, says he and the rest of the Brazil squad are relishing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. ""I think that the responsibility that I have at the national team, like my teammates also have -- each of us has their responsibility. We are a group. One needs the help of the other and we are getting ready so that we can win the World Cup,"" he said. ""So close to the World Cup, every time you see a Brazilian flag or you see some action of the national team, you hear people talking about the World Cup. I can imagine myself lifting the trophy.""","Neymar says his performances have not been affected by transfer saga .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration is asking a special federal court to allow its secret storage of telephone records to be extended beyond the current five-year limit. In a legal brief filed with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that was revealed Wednesday, the Justice Department said several civil lawsuits over the government's so-called metadata collection program require it to preserve those records. ""When litigation is pending against a party (or reasonably anticipated), that party has a duty to preserve -- that is to identify, locate and maintain -- relevant information that may be evidence in the case,"" said federal officials, noting that evidence would likely be used at a trial, which may not be held for months, even years. Current surveillance court orders require the National Security Agency or telecommunication companies that gathered the phone records to destroy the material within five years. The court is likely to grant the request, but may seek assurances the agency would not access the material for intelligence-gathering purposes, absent a warrant. NSA leaker Edward Snowden last June revealed a secret surveillance court order approving government collection of mass amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook. It includes phone numbers called and their location. The exact percentage of metadata being collected has not been revealed publicly. Monitoring of actual conversations requires a separate warrant. President Barack Obama last month cited privacy concerns when announcing that such data should no longer be held by the government, but instead be turned over to the domestic telecoms or a private third party. NSA would still have access to the calls to track potential terror connections. He ordered the intelligence community to formulate such a plan by March 28. The mission of the FISA court, named after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that created it, is to decide whether to grant certain types of government requests -- wiretapping, data analysis, and other monitoring for ""foreign intelligence purposes"" of suspected terrorists and spies operating in the United States. The once-secret approval of collecting bits and pieces of information from electronic communications comes quarterly from judges at the court. To collect the information, the government has to demonstrate to a judge that it is ""relevant"" to an international terrorism investigation. There were 1,856 applications in 2012 to the FISA Court for electronic surveillance and physical searches for ""foreign intelligence purposes,"" the Justice Department said. The current case is In re: Application of the FBI for an Order Requiring the Production of Tangible Things (BR 14-01).","The Obama administration is asking a secret court to extend five-year limit .

"(CNN) -- The guilty pleas of students in a Massachusetts school harassment case this week thrust the spotlight back on bullying in the United States, but the issue is also drawing more attention beyond America's borders. France's education minister made national headlines this week when he announced plans to combat bullying by shutting down Facebook accounts of students who harass their classmates. Mexican legislators approved a new anti-bullying measure this year. And debates on the topic surged in Brazil last month, after a gunman who killed 12 students at a school in Rio de Janeiro said in a homemade video that bullying was one of his motives. Five classmates of a Massachusetts high school freshman who hanged herself in the stairwell of her family's apartment pleaded guilty to charges of criminal harassment, prosecutors said this week. One district attorney described the systematic bullying of Phoebe Prince, 15, who took her own life in January 2010 after weeks of ridicule and teasing at school. More guilty pleas in Massachusetts bullying case . Across the United States, 19.9% of students in grades 9-12 say they were victims of bullying on school property over a one-year period, according to a 2009 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey of a representative sample of United States youth. But bullying is also a global issue, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. About a third of students surveyed in countries from Argentina to Zimbabwe said they had been bullied recently, UNICEF said in a 2006 report, citing two global studies on the issue. ""The most common forms of bullying are verbal and, if left unchecked, verbal bullying can lead to extreme violence,"" the report on violence against children said. Son's suicide prompts bullying lawsuit . The study also notes that cell phones and the Internet provide ""new opportunities for bullying."" France focused on the issue in a two-day conference this week, culminating with Education Minister Luc Chatel's announcement of the government's new partnership with Facebook. ""The solution is simple. We will single out systematically the students that have been bullying on this network, and they will see their accounts closed,"" he said. ""For the more serious cases, we will ensure that the families of student victims have a systems to file complaints, and this will be a partnership with the central office fighting cyber-crimes."" In a statement, Facebook described bullying prevention as an ""important issue,"" pledging to help promote online safety. ""We will also work with our partners to respond effectively in cases where French users have been prosecuted for offences related to online bullying,"" the statement said. Government officials in Mexico have taken a different approach: changing education laws to require federal, state and city authorities to implement policies to identify, prevent, control and stop bullying. ""It is a phenomenon that, if not addressed in time, becomes a problem of health, security and education,"" Mexican lawmaker Jaime Arturo Vazquez Aguilar said. In addition to physical and psychological harm, Vazquez said another long-term effect of bullying is the ""most regrettable."" ""Our girls, boys and youth are getting mixed up, in some cases, in criminal activity,"" he said. At this week's conference, Chatel called on officials, educators and members of the public to take action. ""We must avoid, at all costs, that one day a student prefers to die rather to be in a school where he is harassed, without our schools doing anything about it,"" he said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Gov. David Paterson will announce plans Thursday to introduce same-sex marriage legislation in the state Assembly, according to an assemblyman who was asked to be present for the announcement. A New York assemblyman says Gov. David Paterson knows ""this will be a defining moment."" ""The governor's office called me and asked if I would stand with the governor,"" said Micah Z. Kellner, a state assemblyman from Manhattan. ""I said I will be thrilled to stand with the governor when he makes this announcement."" Paterson has expressed support for gay marriage in the past but when asked Tuesday, he would not confirm details of an announcement. ""There is clearly a problem in that those individuals who are gay or lesbian who would live in a civil union are still not entitled to somewhere between 1,250 and 1,300 civil protections"" available to married couples, Paterson said. ""We would like to try to address that at some point in the near future."" Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer introduced the same bill in 2007. It passed in the Assembly 85-61 but died in the state Senate. The bill's chief supporter in the Senate, Democratic state Sen. Thomas Duane, said Paterson ""knows how hard it is to pass this kind of legislation."" ""He worked to try to pass hate crime legislation for many years,"" Duane said. ""I know how strongly the governor feels about this kind of civil rights legislation."" Paterson has previously said he is committed to bringing ""full marriage equality in New York State."" ""No governor in the history of New York has been at the forefront,"" said Kellner. ""He realizes it is the civil rights movement of the 21st century."" Duane agreed. ""I also know that he [Paterson] knows that this will be a defining moment."" Bruce Anderson, interim executive director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center, said it's ""high time that we have the opportunity to discuss this in Albany."" ""We have waited very long,"" he added. If the legislation passes, it would make New York the fifth state to legalize same sex-marriage. Similar measures have been approved by courts or lawmakers in Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts and Iowa. Because of its previous success in the Assembly, the bill is expected to pass there, but it will need 32 votes to pass in the state Senate. ""We hope to have this bill passed at the end of June, at the end of the legislative session,"" said Kellner. ""No one wants to bring this to the floor to fail, it would be a huge disaster. We want to make sure that if we bring this to the floor for a vote that it passes.""

"(CNN) -- Mario Santos likely never made it to the United States. The 18-year-old set out 10 years ago from his native El Salvador in search of opportunity and a better way of life. But he had to travel north through Mexico first. A short while after leaving, he called his parents to tell them he had been beaten and robbed in Mexico, left penniless and without shoes or clothes. It was the last they heard from him. While it's not certain that Santos is dead, he probably suffered the same fate as 72 migrants from Central and South America whose bodies were found this week in a ranch in northern Mexico, just 90 miles from the U.S. border. Officials are investigating whether they were the victims of human traffickers or drug cartels that prey on migrants. It's a fate that officials say befalls thousands of Central and South Americans every year. ""It's brutal,"" says Peter Hakim, president emeritus of the Inter-American Dialogue, a non-partisan Washington policy institute. ""This is very big business. It's very brutal."" It is indeed big business. Human trafficking is one of the most lucrative forms of crime worldwide after drug and arms trafficking, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said in April. In Mexico, it is a $15 billion- to $20 billion-a-year endeavor, second only to drug trafficking, said Samuel Logan, founding director of Southern Pulse, an online information network focused on Latin America. ""And that may be a conservative estimate,"" Logan said. That money, which used to go mostly to smugglers, now also flows into the hands of drug cartel members. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan, nonprofit policy institute based in Washington, noted in an August report that human smuggling and other illegal activities are playing an increasingly important role as narcotraffickers diversify their activities. ""The drug cartels have not confined themselves to selling narcotics,"" the report said. ""They engage in kidnapping for ransom, extortion, human smuggling and other crimes to augment their incomes."" Some cartels have come to rely more in recent years on human smuggling. ""For the Zetas, it's been one of their main revenue streams for years,"" Logan said about the vicious cartel, which operates mostly in northeastern Mexico. Cartel involvement has increased the risk for migrants crossing through Mexico to get to the United States, said Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights. An investigation by the commission showed that 9,758 migrants were abducted from September 2008 to February 2009, or about 1,600 per month. No one knows exactly how many people try to make the passage every year. The human rights organization Amnesty International estimates it as tens of thousands. More than 90 percent of them are Central Americans, mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, Amnesty International said in a report this year. And the vast majority of these migrants, the rights group said, are headed for the United States. ""Their journey is one of the most dangerous in the world,"" Amnesty International said. ""Every year, thousands of migrants are kidnapped, threatened or assaulted by members of criminal gangs,"" the rights group said. ""Extortion and sexual violence are widespread and many migrants go missing or are killed. Few of these abuses are reported and in most cases those responsible are never held to account."" An indication of how many people attempt the trip can be found in statistics compiled by Mexico's National Migration Service, which tracks how many migrants are detained and returned to their countries of origin each year. Experts note that these are only the migrants who get caught, and that many -- even most -- are not apprehended. Nonetheless, the Mexican agency said it detained 64,061 migrants last year, 60,383 of whom were from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. About 20 percent of them were females and about 8 percent were under the age of 18. Some were under 10. Officials in El Salvador, where the teen-aged Santos started his trip, estimate that about 10,000 Central American migrants suffered some kind of abuse in 2009. ""The vast majority has been committed by these organized crime gangs, such as the Zetas for example, in the route along the Gulf (of Mexico), which is where they operate most frequently,"" said Juan Jose Garcia, the Salvadoran vice minister for citizens living abroad. ""But we also have found events in which (Mexican) authorities have participated,"" Garcia said. The Salvadoran Foreign Ministry estimates up to 150 citizens leave each day for Mexico. Some analysts put that figure at closer to 300. For most Central Americans, that journey begins with a human smuggler, commonly called a ""pollero."" In the United States, the smugglers are better known as ""coyotes."" For a set fee, usually ranging from $850 to $5,000 a head,  a smuggler will deliver a migrant to the border of the United States or even offer passage across. Problems often arise when smugglers and migrants approach the border and organized crime organizations get involved. ""This is where things get complicated,"" said Logan, who is writing a book on the Zetas and is the author of ""This is for the Mara Salvatrucha: Inside the MS-13 America's Most Violent Gang."" The drug-trafficking organizations charge the ""polleros"" a price per person for the right to cross over their territory, a practice called ""derecho de piso,""  or right of passage. Or they will abduct the migrants and hold them for ransom from their relatives and friends in the United States or family back home. Often times, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said, migrants who are abducted are subjected to sexual or labor exploitation. If the migrants are being held for ransom and the money is not paid in time, the situation can get ugly. ""Sometimes the Mexican organized crime group says, 'The hell with it. We're not going to deal with these people,' and they kill them all,"" Logan said. That's what may have happened, Logan said, to the 72 people whose bodies were found Tuesday in a ranch building in Tamaulipas state, about 14 miles (22 kilometers) from the town of San Fernando, near the border with Texas. Or the migrants may have refused to work for the cartel, which is one possibility that has been mentioned in news accounts. A bloody turf war between the Zetas and the Gulf cartels also may have complicated matters because the smugglers may not have known who to pay or may have paid one group and angered the other. ""In Tamaulipas, it's very hard for a pollero to know who is who,"" Logan said. ""The Zetas and Gulf cartels were once allied and now have split."" At any rate, the involvement of the drug cartels has changed the dynamics of human smuggling in Mexico, said Andrew Selee, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico Institute. Selee remembers living in northern Mexico a few years back and knowing that a father-son duo who lived on his block were ""polleros."" ""That's gone,"" Selee said, noting that the costs of having to pay cartels for the right to cross their territory has driven out small-time smugglers. ""They now have to be big enough to handle those costs,"" Selee said. Selee and the Inter-American Dialogue's Hakim point out that increased border security and interdiction by the United States also has led to cartel involvement because of the level of sophistication and complexity now often involved in getting someone across the border. The cartels already have the routes and other facilities in place they use for smuggling drugs. ""We're no longer talking about a simple process that involves one or two individuals,"" Selee said. ""This has become much more dangerous."" As always, profit is the motive. ""The smuggling became profitable the more the United States began to build barriers to immigration,"" Hakim said. On Thursday, Amnesty International called on the Mexican government to take swift action about the slayings of the 72 people in Tamaulipas. ""Amnesty International issued a report in April highlighting the failure of Mexican federal and state authorities to implement effective measures to prevent and punish thousands of kidnappings, killings and rape of irregular migrants at the hands of criminal gangs, who often operate with the complicity or acquiescence of public officials,"" the rights group said in a release. ""This case once again demonstrates the extreme dangers faced by migrants and the apparent inability of both federal and state authorities to reduce the attacks that migrants face. The response of the authorities to this case will be a test."" It's too late for the families of the victims. For the parents of Mario Santos, the Salvadoran who disappeared 10 years ago, much of the anguish lies in not knowing what happened. ""If only he would call me on the telephone and I would know he is alive, even if I never saw him again, that would satisfy me,"" said his father, Daniel Santos. For thousands of Central American families, the phone does not ring. Journalist Merlin Delcid contributed to this report.","The road to the United States goes through Mexico for Central Americans .

"(CNN) -- If we were hoping that the finally released -- but month-old -- preliminary report on the March 8 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 would help explain what happened, we were mostly disappointed. But the report, issued Thursday and dated April 9, does add new insights on snafus in crucial communication between air traffic control centers and Malaysia Airlines on the morning Flight 370 disappeared. They are disturbing -- and put the competence of the airline's operations center in question. Indeed the brevity of the report (five pages) seems to show a Malaysian Ministry of Transport still interested in sharing as little information as possible, especially when compared with the extensive detail in preliminary reports from other accidents, such as the loss of Air France Flight 447 in June 2009. What we do learn from this new report is that the airline told controllers -- who were already looking for Flight 370 -- that everything was normal, delaying the realization that the plane was many hundreds of miles from where it was thought to be, and any attempts at finding it. In fact, it would be three hours and 52 minutes between the time that the controller in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, reported to air traffic control in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, that Flight 370 had not contacted him as instructed, and the time that the Kuala Lumpur rescue center was activated. Here's what the report says happened: . The Ho Chi Minh controller reported he saw the aircraft over the IGARI navigational waypoint, a position still within Malaysian airspace where the flight had been instructed to contact Ho Chi Minh, but he did not have verbal contact. The controller further noted the observed ""radar blip"" disappeared over another waypoint along the aircraft's route northeast of IGARI, within Ho Chi Minh airspace and less than 100 miles from the southern tip of Vietnam. After not hearing from the flight for 17 minutes after expected, the two controllers spent 20 minutes trying to contact the aircraft on ""many"" frequencies, the report says, and through relays from other aircraft in the area, as would be expected. Then the controllers turned to the airline, and here things became odd. At 2:03 a.m. local time, Malaysia Airlines' operation control center told the watch supervisor at Kuala Lumpur air traffic control that the flight was in Cambodian airspace. It was not planned to enter that airspace. The Ho Chi Minh controller, apparently skeptical of the airline's information, requested confirmation. When queried, the airline said it was able to ""exchange signals"" with the flight. Apparently still unaware that something was amiss, at 2:35 a.m., nearly an hour after last contact with air traffic control and more than 30 minutes after reporting the airplane to be in Cambodian airspace, the airline informed Kuala Lumpur air traffic control that the airplane was ""in normal condition based on signal download"" and placed its position on course a few miles off eastern Vietnam. The report makes no mention of whether the airline attempted to contact the airplane directly through satellite calls or data-link messages. At 03:30 a.m., almost an hour after the airline's last report put the aircraft in normal condition east of Vietnam, its operations center reported the position was based on a prediction of the flight's progress, not its actual position. Controllers expanded their contact attempts to include the Hong Kong and Beijing air traffic control centers, which also had no contact with the aircraft. Controllers don't instantly sound the alarm when an airplane doesn't call them as expected. Air traffic communications are not perfect in day-to-day operations, and the controller exchanges reflect that. A gap in radio coverage, a misdialed frequency and other everyday occurrences were good reason for the controllers not to react immediately. Controllers took the expected actions in attempting to reach the flight on various frequencies and by other aircraft. A transponder, too, occasionally fails, and air traffic control will ask an airplane's crew to reset it, but radio contact is required to do so. There are three phases of alerts in an air rescue situation, based on international protocols: The uncertainty phase, when no communication is received for 30 minutes after it should have been; the alert phase, when attempts to contact the crew or inquiries to other relevant sources have failed to reveal any information; and the distress phase, when further inquiries have failed to provide any information or when fuel on board is considered to be exhausted. Clearly the misinformation provided by the airline that had controllers searching and attempting to contact the aircraft over much of Southeast Asia kept officials from realizing the airplane had never even reached the coast of Vietnam. That conclusion was not drawn until 5:20 a.m., after which the watch supervisor at Kuala Lumpur air traffic control activated the distress protocol. By then the airplane was likely somewhere well out over the Indian Ocean. By then it had already been off air defense radar for hours, though it would take a replay of that data to see if it were ever on there in the first place. This scenario highlights some of the real-life difficulties associated with the current state of international air traffic control. We rely on electronic equipment on board the airplane reporting its position -- secondary radar (using transponders) and data-link communications. In remote oceanic areas, airplanes operate for many hours beyond any radar contact, where radio communication is also difficult. Position and voice transmissions are periodic, not constant. For the modern air traffic control system, the current technology works well nearly 100% of the time. However, when the electronics fail for whatever reason -- and there are many possibilities -- we are left with nothing. In the case of Air France Flight 447, controllers looking for contact with the aircraft and the airline had similar communications issues. The investigation of that disappearance revealed a surprising lack of coordination between air traffic control agencies, their inability to contact each other and clarity on who should be initiating emergency protocols when contact is lost. In that case, too, there were erroneous reports -- that the flight was OK and nearing Portugal airspace -- though this time from controllers. Air France had, just before then, become anxious about the error messages sent from the airplane -- which unbeknown to anyone had crashed more than four hours earlier north of Brazil. Many controllers and agencies were asking about the flight, but no one had triggered the uncertainty, alert and distress phases of the process. Details of these same processes in the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 case remain unclear. The preliminary report on Flight 370 concludes with one safety recommendation: to examine the safety benefits of introducing a standard for real-time tracking of commercial air transport aircraft. Systems such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast -- essentially GPS -- currently offer that type of coverage over or near land, and Flight 370 was so equipped. However, over remote areas the problem is more complex and expensive, and it still depends on whether or not the equipment on the plane is working.","Bill Palmer: Report on Flight 370 adds a few new insights on communications snafus .

"(CNN) -- It was billed as a showdown between king and country: John Gosden's imperious Kingman versus Aiden O'Brien's exciting Australia. In the end it was 40-1 shot Night of Thunder, ridden by Kieren Fallon, who delivered a shock result in the first Classic of the English season. Racing is a sport of many long and proud traditions. The newest of these is surely the preoccupation, in the run up to the 2,000 Guineas, with identifying the ""next Frankel."" Perhaps inevitably, Kingman, running in the same green, pink and white colours of Khalid Abdulla, had bourn the brunt of this fevered speculation. A star turn in the Greenham Stakes -- a race also won by Frankel en route to his Guineas in 2011 -- did nothing to quell racing fans' hopes that lightening could, perhaps, strike twice. Kingman's only vulnerability appeared to be the ground -- he needed surgery last year to remove a bone chip and connections were concerned about the going being too fast. In the end it was not drought but thunder they should have worried about. The 14-runner field had split into two groups at the start of the race, with one group, containing pre-race favorite Kingman and Night of Thunder, being lead by Spanish challenger Noozhoh Canarias, while the second was headed by Night of Thunder's more fancied stable mate Toormore. As the two groups approached the final half-furlong, Kingman's jockey James Doyle looked to have timed his run perfectly on the outside, with Joseph O'Brien and Australia matching him stride-for-stride on the inside. Night of Thunder, however, appeared on Kingman's flank and looked set to take him on, before taking an unexplained detour to join Australia on the stands side. Powered home . Despite losing valuable seconds in the switch, Night of Thunder powered home to win by half a length. Kingman and Australia were split by a head in second and third respectively. It was a first Classic win, on paper, at least, for Richard Hannon, Jr., who took the reins of his father's training operation just this season. The normally voluble Hannon was lost for words as the plaudits rained down on his champion. ""It's the stuff of dreams,"" said Hannon. ""As a school boy you dream of days like this -- you think you might get there one day, and you might not. But we've done it."" By contrast, Night of Thunder's veteran jockey Fallon, is a previous four-time winner of this race. The 49-year-old has seen his fair share of ups and downs in a colorful career which has seen him crowned Champion Jockey six times yet also serve lengthy bans following accusations of race fixing and testing positive for banned substances. ""It's brilliant,"" said Fallon, whose last win in the race came in 2006. ""It's a great race to win and it kick-starts our confidence for the year."" From here, thoughts inevitably turn to the Derby, the next of the English ""Classics"" on the calendar. Australia, on pedigree, should have his best chance at Epsom (he is the son of a Derby winner and an Oaks winner), while Kingman has shown too much class in his career to date to be written off just yet. The search for the next Frankel goes on. Fabre breaks 1,000 Guineas duck . In the fillies' equivalent Sunday, French raider Miss France delivered the goods under jockey Maxime Guyon to give master trainer Andre Fabre his first victory in the 1,000 Guineas. Tucked in behind early pacesetter Manderley, Miss France showed a devastating turn of foot to beat a fast-finishing Lightening Thunder in a thrilling finish. It was a marked change of tactics for the winner of the Oh So Sharp Stakes. 24-time French champion trainer Fabre told reporters that the ride was ""the exact opposite of the way I wanted her ridden -- but it worked."" It is expected she will now be targeted at the ""French Oaks"" -- the Prix de Diane.","Night of Thunder wins 2,000 Guineas .

"(TIME.com) -- On the first day back to school after 20 first-graders and six adults died at a Connecticut elementary school, students at a Utah middle school gathered to discuss the massacre. A boy raised his hand. ""The reason why this man shot little kids is because he has autism,"" he said. Tricia Nelson's seventh-grade son was at the assembly. He's shy, not the kind of child apt to speak in public, but his hand darted up in response. ""Autism doesn't make people shoot other people,"" he said. At 12, Nelson's son is somewhat of an expert on autism. His younger brother, who is 10, has a severe form of the neurodevelopmental disorder. He doesn't speak and he attends a school for special needs. But he is not violent, said his older brother; he would not kill anyone. Amid unconfirmed media reports that alleged gunman Adam Lanza, 20, had Asperger's, a high-functioning form of autism marked by social awkwardness, autism experts are mobilizing to combat misconceptions about the condition. Parents are reaching out to school principals to ensure that students with autism aren't being taunted. Advocates have issued statements disavowing any link between autism and premeditated aggression. And children -- more often than not the siblings of kids who have autism -- are standing up for others. TIME.com: Behavior therapy normalizes brains of autistic children . ""He was in tears when he was telling me what happened,"" says Nelson of her older son. She is an events organizer for Autism Speaks, the world's largest autism research and advocacy group. ""He said, 'This boy is going to spread rumors.'"" After Nelson's son spoke up, a teacher seconded his comments. She urged the students not to make assumptions. Yet as the country struggles to come to grips with the loss of life at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, people with autism are finding themselves the focus of misunderstanding and more than a little scrutiny. Calls and emails to Autism Speaks' hotline are up 130% since Friday's shooting as worried parents wonder how to channel their concern. In an effort to address possible backlash against people who have autism, this week Autism Speaks plans to release formal suggestions for how to educate school leaders, teachers and friends about the characteristics of children with the condition. ""We've had a number of families say their children's classmates have said, 'I hear the shooter has autism, and doesn't your brother or sister have autism?'"" says Peter Bell, Autism Speaks' executive vice president for programs and services. ""It seems like they're wanting to put the blame squarely on the fact that the shooter may have had autism. This rush to put a label on the situation has caused significant harm already."" TIME.com: Using brain activity patterns to identify autism in kids as young as 2 . To dispel misunderstandings, developmental experts are trying to share accurate information about autism spectrum disorders. Poor social skills, trouble communicating and repetitive behaviors are all hallmarks of autism, but there's no correlation with violence, says pediatric neuropsychologist Michelle Dunn, director of Montefiore Medical Center's Neurology and Autism Center in the Bronx. ""Even if (Lanza) had Asperger's, it wouldn't explain his behavior,"" says Dunn. ""In terms of premeditation and how horrific this act was, there is absolutely no association."" People with autism can get easily frustrated, especially when their routines are disrupted. They may yell and scream, throw themselves on the floor or punch something. But it's important to publicly reject any connection with planned violence, says Dunn. But a widely circulated essay, ""I Am Adam Lanza's Mother,"" by Liza Long, is making that message harder to convey. In the post, Long shared her complex relationship with her 13-year-old mentally ill son, who loves Harry Potter and stuffed animals but has also threatened her with a knife on countless occasions. As her story made the Internet rounds, autism advocates rushed to point out that autism is a brain-related developmental problem and not a mental illness. TIME.com: The backlash against 'I am Adam Lanza's Mother' The former chairwoman of the Newtown school board has also expressed dismay, noting that some of the murdered teachers had worked with kids with special needs, including children with autism who attend Sandy Hook. In a survey sent Monday to 31,000 parents who are members of MyAutismTeam, a social network that serves as a Facebook for parents who have children with the condition, 30% indicated that they're worried their children will be treated differently by teachers and other students in the aftermath of Sandy Hook. They're also nervous that bullying -- kids with autism are already disproportionately targeted -- will increase. ""To have this association to mass murder pinned to them is like putting another target on their heads,"" says Christine Pasour, the mother of an 11-year-old son with Asperger's. High-functioning teens with autism are also perplexed. On Monday, Dunn got a call from a mother who wanted to make an appointment for her 17-year-old son, who has been getting questioned by classmates. ""Some of these kids who know their diagnosis are asking the question, 'Could I turn out to be violent too?'"" says Dunn. ""He is very worried about himself."" On message boards and social networks, parents are offering strategies for confronting the uncertainty. Discussing autistic kids' quirky or unusual behavior candidly with school leaders and classmates can help, they suggest. Pasour posted on MyAutismTeam that she'd read ""some horrible, horrible"" comments on various news sites about Lanza's reported Asperger's diagnosis. ""Keep in mind that this may be the first time many Americans will even hear about Asperger's ... This has the potential of creating horrible bullying situations for our kids."" Her son has been home sick with the flu, but when he returns to school Wednesday, Pasour, from Dallas, North Carolina, plans to ask his principal and teachers to ""keep their ear to the ground"" to make sure no one is saying anything inappropriate. It comes down to education, says Pasour. ""Children have an amazing ability to grow and to learn and to be empathetic,"" she says.

"Rutundu, Kenya (CNN) -- When Prince William marries Kate Middleton with the whole world watching Friday, it will be a far cry from the private engagement at a rustic log cabin in the quiet African wilderness. The couple was engaged at the Rutundu cabin on the northern slopes of Mount Kenya, a secluded getaway near a sprawling animal reserve where rhinos and giraffes roam freely. Prince William and Kate Middleton secretly flew into the country in October and headed to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where he had spent a year before going to the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. ""Kenya has always been very close to Prince William's heart. He's been coming here for many years. He loves it,"" said Ian Craig, founder of the Lewa and owner of the cabin. However, the October visit was different. The prince was waiting for the perfect opportunity to pop the question, his mother's ring stashed in his backpack. ""I had been carrying it around in my rucksack for three weeks before that, and I literally would not let it go,"" the prince said in an official interview after the engagement. ""Wherever I went, I kept hold of it because I knew this thing, if it disappeared, I would be in a lot of trouble."" He finally found the perfect spot at the cabin, which has a clear view of Mount Kenya, the nation's highest mountain. He proposed to his college sweetheart at the secluded spot surrounded by crisp lakes and whistling birds. Prince William, the second in line to the British throne, will marry Middleton at Westminster Abbey in London on Friday. Middleton said the proposal left her shocked. ""We were out there with friends and things, so I really didn't expect it at all,"" she said. The royal family's relationship with Kenya is not new. Princess Elizabeth was in the east African nation in 1952 when she found out her father had died and she was to become queen. More than half a century later, the country's tie to the royal family remains. ""I think he wanted to share Kenya with his new bride, unknown to us at the time,"" Craig said. Prince William and his bride-to-be stayed in the more spacious of the two log-cabins near the Lewa wildlife reserve, nothing like the lavish Buckingham Palace. It features the bare minimum; a fireplace, a couch and a canopy bed with thick woolly blankets. Guests fish in private rivers near their cabin. At night, candles and cackling fires provide light. What the cottage lacks in luxury, it makes up in the view, with panoramic scenes of Mount Kenya and the Rift Valley. ""He's a true romantic and we had a wonderful holiday in Africa,"" Middleton said after the engagement. ""It was very romantic and it was a very personal time for both of us."" Temperatures in the high altitude area drop drastically as the sun sets. Simple surroundings and chilly nights aside, the prince was well equipped for the trip. ""Brought more warm clothes this time!"" he wrote in the cabin guestbook. There was one problem, though. The pair did not catch any fish during their stay. ""Sadly no fish to be found but we had great fun trying,"" Middleton wrote in the guestbook. She however headed home with a far bigger prize: a sapphire engagement ring.","Prince William chose a rustic cabin for the engagement .

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of tourists, scientists and amateur astronomers gathered Wednesday along Australia's northern tip to witness a rare total solar eclipse. For just two eerie minutes in the early hours of the morning local time, the country - known for its blistering sunshine - was plunged into a chilly darkness. Onlookers gathered at vantage points on beaches, in boats and even hot air balloons to catch a glimpse of the celestial light show which, according to NASA, is unlikely to be seen again in the same region for another 360 years. Submit your solar eclipse photos . A solar eclipse happens when the moon, as it orbits Earth, passes directly in front of the sun, obscuring its rays and casting a shadow on Earth's surface. Sometimes referred to as a ""happy accident of nature,"" a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon is perfectly aligned with both the sun and Earth, so it appears from our perspective that the sun is completely blocked. iReporters were on hand to capture this extraordinary astronomical moment for CNN, sending in images from across the region -- from Australia, New Zealand and even from a cruise ship hundreds of miles off the Australian coast. Chad Loel Rademan captured stunning images of the eclipse while on a cruise specifically for keen sky watchers. ""The weather almost killed it -- there were heavy clouds at the start and everyone was very somber and nervous,"" he said. ""The ship manoeuvred toward breaks in the clouds and we got lucky -- it emerged from the breaks in time for the eclipse."" Bright spark or dimwit? Take the solar eclipse quiz . Maj Coop from Brisbane, Australia, sent in an unusual image of the eclipse -- as seen through an X-ray of her mother's hand. ""The neighbors probably thought I was a bit strange holding up this X-ray for a while, but after I while I realized it actually looked quite interesting - like my mother was reaching out to hold the sun in her hand,"" she said. The eclipse was not entirely confined to Australia -- in Wellington, New Zealand, iReporter Sam Hill decided that, even though they would not see the eclipse in all its glory, it was still worth capturing. ""I thought it would be cool to take a few photos because I haven't seen an eclipse in my lifetime,"" he said. Hundreds of onlookers used popular photo-sharing app Instagram to lend a cinematic, retro feel to their sun shots. Many included the #CNNCelebrates hashtag and sent in their best snaps to iReport. Dave Thompson sent in his image of the eclipse in Pormpuraaw, rural northern Queensland, Australia, via Instagram. He summed up the mood when the big moment finally arrived in one simple word: ""epic"".","A total solar eclipse was visible over Australia's Northern Territories on November 14 .

"(CNN) -- Ian Thorpe, Australia's greatest Olympian, has been admitted to rehabilitation in an effort to battle his depression. Police in Sydney were called in the early hours of Monday morning after the 31-year-old former swimming champion was spotted behaving strangely near a vehicle and was judged to be disorientated. The five-time gold medalist was taken to Bankstown hospital before being transferred to rehab just days after his management company rejected speculation that Thorpe had undergone treatment for depression and alcoholism. ""Following a fall at home on Tuesday, Ian was admitted to hospital after sustaining an injury to his shoulder,"" Thorpe's management company told CNN. ""He underwent surgery on Wednesday and was discharged the following day. On Sunday, Ian was taken to Bankstown Hospital and then onto a rehabilitation clinic after being found disorientated and trying to get in to what he thought was a friend's car. ""Ian had been on a series of painkillers and antidepressants following surgery on his shoulder. No alcohol was involved and Ian was admitted to rehabilitation for his ongoing struggle with depression. ""The family have requested the public and media respect their privacy at this time."" Thorpe, one of the most recognizable faces in Australian sport, revealed he has struggled to adjust to life after his failure to make the team for the 2012 London Olympics. While friends and family have rallied around Thorpe, the star has failed to reach an even keel. In his autobiography, which was published last year, Thorpe admitted that he had spent ""a lot of my life battling what I can only describe as crippling depression. ""I suppose it was inevitable that I'd turn to other, artificial ways of managing my feelings, and I found alcohol."" Thorpe's admission comes just days after his management company was forced to deny speculation that the former Olympic champion had booked into rehab. But this latest episode signals a turn for the worse for one of swimming's most iconic figures. Thorpe retired from competitive action in 2006 only to launch a failed comeback six years later where he attempted to qualify for the London Games. He had harbored hopes of being selected for the Commonwealth Games in Scotland in July but a shoulder injury scuppered his chances and led to him retiring from competitive swimming for a final time. Thorpe had spent the past 18 months living in Switzerland but returned to Sydney to spend Christmas with his parents. His manager, James Erskine, confirmed Thorpe insisted his client had no alcohol in his system when he was met by police but was under influence of antidepressants and medication for his shoulder. In his book, Thorpe revealed how he was often driven to alcohol to find some kind of release. ""I used alcohol as a means to rid my head of terrible thoughts, as a way of managing my moods,"" he wrote. ""I did it behind closed doors, where many depressed people choose to fight their demons before they realize they can't do it without help. ""There were numerous occasions as I trained to defend my Olympic titles in Athens that I abused myself this way -- always alone and in a mist of disgrace. It's like a weight is pressing down on you. There are days when you just can't get out of bed. You cannot face the world. ""You tell yourself simple things like: 'Just get to the kitchen and get a glass of water.' But not being able to do something so basic is frightening.'' The swimmer, nicknamed 'Thorpedo', came to prominence at the 2000 Sydney Olympics by winning three gold and two silver medals. His abnormally large hands and feet, which explained his incredible speed, brought him great success and won him thousands of fans. He followed up his success four years later in Athens by clinching two more gold medals. Thorpe also won 11 World Championships gold medals, including six in 2001.","Ian Thorpe admitted to rehab with depression .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas called on voters to back a third-party candidate for president Wednesday, rejecting his party's nominee and offering equally harsh words for the Democratic candidate. Paul, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination this year, told supporters at the National Press Club in Washington that he is not endorsing GOP nominee Sen. John McCain or Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama. Instead, Paul will give his seal of approval to four candidates: Green Party nominee Cynthia McKinney, Libertarian Party nominee Bob Barr, independent candidate Ralph Nader and Constitution Party candidate Chuck Baldwin. Paul said he's supporting the third-party candidates because the two major parties and media had ""colluded"" to avoid discussing issues and falsely presenting the difference between McCain and Obama as real. ""I've come to the conclusion, after having spent many years in politics, is that our presidential elections turn out to be more of a charade than anything else, and I think that is true today. It is a charade,"" he said. Paul offered an open endorsement to the four candidates because each signed onto a policy statement that calls for ""balancing budgets, bring troops home, personal liberties and investigating the Federal Reserve,"" an aide to the congressman said. Paul said a strong showing by the third-party candidates would express the public's frustration with the current system. ""I have no doubt that the majority is on our side,"" Paul added, citing public opinion polls. ""We represent the majority of the American people."" Paul said that he had received a call from the McCain campaign Tuesday asking for his endorsement. Paul's response: ""I don't like the idea of getting 2 to 3 million people [Paul supporters] angry at me."" McCain's aides argued that the Texas Republican should endorse McCain because he would do a ""little less harm"" than Obama, Paul said, but ""we just don't need to do that anymore."" ""If you ever get to the point where you believe the two parties are essentially the same, if the majority is outside of the establishment, it's not very democratic. The process is not working,"" Paul said. Paul attacked Obama, saying, ""He's not for change,"" and the congressman argued that his efforts would help the Republican Party. ""If the Republican side realized what I'm trying to do, they should be funding me,"" Paul said. Paul failed in his bid for the Republican nomination, but he found a large, diverse audience for his anti-war and anti-tax messages. The Texas congressman's campaign was fueled by an on-line, grass-roots fundraising operation. Throughout the campaign, Paul supporters called on others to join the ""Ron Paul Revolution."" At the Republican National Convention last week in St. Paul, Minnesota, Paul supporters threw their own party in Minneapolis. iReport.com: See Ron Paul signs raised high at the ""counter-convention"" Paul, who said he entered the presidential race reluctantly, told the roaring audience, ""I lost my skepticism.

"New York (CNN) -- He was suddenly among the most notorious, hunted men in the world, but in the hours after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Osama bin Laden wasn't concerned with running or hiding. His first order of business was instead to see Kuwaiti religious scholar Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, said federal prosecutor John Cronan Monday during his closing argument in Abu Ghaith's trial on charges he aided terrorists. The trial, in its third week, is being held blocks away from the site of Manhattan's World Trade Center, and several survivors of the attacks and family members of victims were in attendance Monday. Cronan told the jury Abu Ghaith played a crucial role as the organization's principal spokesman, helping ""restore al Qaeda's trove of new terrorists"" as missions turned its members into martyrs. ""Without people like him, al Qaeda dies with every suicide attack,"" Cronan said. Abu Ghaith testified last week he never joined the ranks of al Qaeda and assisted bin Laden only as a speaker on religious and spiritual topics. He conceded to taking on a larger role after the September 11 meeting, when bin Laden asked him to help ""deliver a message to the world,"" and he appeared in a series of videos making passionate calls for further attacks on Americans. Defense attorney Stanley Cohen accused prosecutors of using 9/11 imagery in lieu of evidence of his client's guilt and told the jurors he had counted 172 references to Osama bin Laden and 9/11 during the first half of the prosecution's closing argument. ""It was intended to sweep you away in anguish and pain and to ask for retaliation,"" he told the panel. ""It was intended to make you look away from the evidence."" He said none of the government's witnesses conclusively tied his client to terrorism-related activities, including a terrorism specialist with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and two cooperating former al Qaeda members. Cohen asked the jury to send its own message to the world with its verdict: that the American system of justice works fairly, and that simply calling someone a terrorist is not enough for a criminal conviction. ""This is Abu Ghaith,"" said the attorney, motioning to his client. ""He's a Muslim, an Arab, an imam. He's a human being."" The jury is expected to begin its deliberations Tuesday morning.","Prosecution and defense appeal to jury in trial of Osama bin Laden's son-in-law .

"(CNN) -- Interim Egyptian President Adly Mansour assured the family of imprisoned Australian journalist Peter Greste that he ""will spare no effort to work towards the speedy resolution of the case."" Mansour's pledge was made in a letter to parents Juris and Lois Greste, almost three months after the Al Jazeera journalist was arrested in Cairo on terrorism-related charges, along with two colleagues. Greste, producer Mohamed Fahmy and producer Baher Mohamed, were arrested December 29 at a Cairo hotel room and later charged with joining a terrorist organization -- the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood, as well as broadcasting false information and working in Egypt without permits. Reports said Mansour's letter was in response to one sent by the Al Jazeera English journalist's parents. ""As a father I'd love to convey my understanding of the prevailing emotions of distress and anguish amongst both Peter and the whole family,"" Mansour wrote in the letter, which was published by his office. ""Notwithstanding the independence of the judiciary and that his full rights are guaranteed under the law, I would like to assure you in my capacity as President of Egypt, that I will spare no effort to work towards the speedy resolution of the case, in a fashion consistent with the law and that guarantees the reunion of the family in the near future."" International condemnation . Earlier this month, prosecutors presented evidence at a hearing for the three journalists, but they did little to explain why everyday broadcast equipment and the defendants' personal belongings would implicate them in any crime. Throughout the hearing, the defendants were kept in a caged dock steps away from their family members. The three are among 20 defendants authorities have charged with crimes; the Qatar-based Al Jazeera says only eight have worked for the network. The trial has drawn international condemnation from human rights groups, who say the arrests indicate authorities in Egypt are stifling dissent and freedom of the press. The case comes amid a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood after the ouster of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsy, in July. The accused have denied the allegations against them, with the journalists saying they were simply doing their jobs. The trial was adjourned until March 24.","Mansour: ""I will spare no effort to work towards the speedy resolution of the case""

"(CNN) -- An FBI agent was arrested in Pakistan this week after he attempted to board a domestic flight between Karachi and Islamabad with ammunition and knives, police said Wednesday. The man was arrested Monday with fifteen 9 mm bullets, three small knives and a wrench, according to police Superintendent Malir Rao Anwar. All of those items, along with his laptop computer and cell phone, have been taken to a forensics lab for analysis. The agent was visiting Pakistan as part of an assignment to train local police, a U.S. law enforcement official said. A State Department official said diplomats are working with Pakistani authorities to gain the release of the agent. He appeared in court Tuesday to face anti-terrorism charges, which restrict unauthorized weapons and ammunition on commercial flights, and he is scheduled to appear again Saturday. Employees for the FBI and other U.S. agencies are allowed to carry weapons in Pakistan when authorized. U.S. officials hope this incident is more easily resolved than the 2011 case of a CIA contractor who was arrested and charged with killing two men. Raymond Davis said that he believed they were trying to rob him. The case inflamed local anti-American sentiment and soured relations until the United States agreed to compensate the families of the two men. Davis was then freed. Rao Anwar said he expects the case to go to trail, calling it a matter of ""upholding Pakistan's dignity and honor. (The agent) acted illegally, and his arrest is perfectly legal.""

"(CNN) -- Marc Marquez held off a resurgent Valentino Rossi to win his fourth straight MotoGP race since start of the season with first victory Sunday at the Spanish circuit of Jerez. The Repsol Honda rider is the first man since Australian great Mick Doohan in 1992 to win the opening four rounds of the season in motorcycling's premier class and he was never headed after starting from pole. He had built up a four second lead by lap 12, but a charging Rossi on his Yamaha had closed up the finish in Andalusia.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Over the past few days, the families of the 154 Chinese passengers who were aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have been oscillating between grief and visceral anger as the search for the plane carrying their loved ones continues. In emotional scenes at a Beijing hotel where many of them have been staying for more than two weeks, some distraught relatives collapsed and had to be taken to hospital. Other relatives angrily defied police admonishments and marched to the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing earlier this week. Wearing white T-shirts emblazoned with ""Pray for MH370,"" they shouted their demand for ""evidence"" the airliner ended its journey in the southern Indian Ocean, and called the Malaysians ""liars,"" accusing the authorities in Kuala Lumpur of withholding information. Rare demonstration . The protest, rare in a country that bans unsanctioned mass gatherings, seemed spontaneous, according to one official, who requested anonymity because he's not authorized to speak to the media. ""The police were told to block them but to let them through if they breached the police line,"" he said. ""They were told to show restraint."" So did the Chinese government encourage the protest? ""Tolerated, yes, but not encouraged,"" the source said. ""There are many malcontents in China and they may join the angry families and shift the target from Malaysia to the government. The aim is to let them express anger while keeping them restrained."" But there was little restraint among China's legions of netizens. In the past few days, everyone from celebrities to leading bloggers have posted angry comments aimed at Malaysia, with some even calling for a boycott of all things Malaysian. Zhang Ziyi, an actress known for her starring roles in Hollywood hits such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" took to Weibo, China's Twitter-like micro-blogging service, to berate Malaysia. ""Malaysian government, you are wrong not to revere life. You are wrong not to respect the universal quest for truth,"" she wrote. Chen Kun, a popular actor who has 72 million Weibo followers, appealed for decisive action. ""For the clownish prevarication and lies of the Malaysian government and the MAS (Malaysia Airlines), and your disrespect of our people, please let me, coming from my heart, boycott all Malaysia-related commercial products and tours related. Not just for the brief moment when the missing plane is in the heat of attention, but indefinitely."" In less than a day, his posting was shared more than 70,000 times. Not all agreed with Chen Kun. One Weibo user retorted: ""Malaysia is nice -- I stayed there for a week in 2007 and had pleasant memory of the place. To boycott the airline because of the incident is like stop eating after choking on food. To boycott the whole country because of the unreliability of the Malaysian government is also a personal loss for you. It's not the Chinese government is that reliable."" Pressure on Beijing . The emotional public reaction, analysts said, has added pressure on the Chinese government. President Xi Jinping has dispatched a special envoy to Kuala Lumpur, who promptly met with the Malaysian prime minister and other top officials to discuss the crisis. A day earlier, Chinese government spokesman Hong Lei used calibrated but strong language in a statement, saying China ""demanded"" that Malaysia disclose information. ""The Chinese government has closely cooperated with the Malaysian government from the very beginning,"" Victor Zhikai Gao, a leading China commentator, told CNN. ""However, it is clear that the Chinese government is increasingly asking the Malaysian government to come up with all the relevant data and information."" Gao said it's ""understandable"" this tragic incident ""may have caught the Malaysian government unprepared, and the magnitude of the incident may have overwhelmed them."" Full disclosure . But he cautioned against anything but full disclosure when it comes to disseminating information about the investigation. ""It is an increasing concern ... that the Malaysian side may not have been most upfront and transparent from the very beginning,"" Gao said. ""The contradictions in the information they have disclosed bit by bit, piece by piece, may have the result of intentional withholding of information, or even lack of transparency and complete disclosure."" Such a perception, he said, may be changing the attitude of many people towards the way the Malaysian government has handled this incident. Yet China is caught between a rock and a hard place. Mystery of missing airliner surfaces pain of 1977 tragedy . Chinese officials need to show the Chinese families and public at large that they're doing their best, and using everything at China's disposal to help the loved ones of passengers. It cannot afford to publicly look callous, inept or weak. At the same time, and for geopolitical reasons, China needs to carefully manage relations with Malaysia, an important partner in the ASEAN bloc. Beijing's relations with Malaysia have generally been more cordial than with other neighbors in the region, even though they have conflicting territorial claims over a group islands in South China Sea. ""China cannot afford to alienate Malaysia,"" said another Chinese source who asked not to be named. ""It needs Malaysia as a counter-weight to countries like the Philippines and Singapore in its diplomatic strategy in the region, especially in Southeast Asia."" Time will tell if the Malaysian side could have done much better in handling this tragic incident, said Gao. ""For the moment, let's urge the Malaysian side to fully disclose all data and information in their possession.""","Relatives of Chinese passengers on MH370 have been holed up in Beijing hotel .
Many have taken their anger to Malaysian embassy amid lack of information .
Street protests largely banned in China amid fears of social unrest .
China also keen not to alienate itself from Malaysia, an ASEAN partner ."
"(CNN) -- Europe's Eastern policy, if there ever really was one, is in tatters. It has unraveled at breakneck speed, as Russia moved against Ukraine, effectively annexed part of its territory, and put its smaller neighbor on the brink of war. Moving from disbelief to dismay to horror, Europeans lost whatever hopes and illusions they may have harbored that Russia was a predictable and cooperative partner. Instead, images are being invoked of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and in Hungary in 1956, and a new Cold War seems fully possible now. However far-fetched they may seem, these comparisons reflect a frantic search among Western politicians and experts for the underlying causes, rationales and consequences of Russia's actions in Ukraine. And it slowly dawns on Europe that it is witness to a sea change in Russian foreign policy that shakes the very foundations of the European order that emerged after the fall of the Iron Curtain. New interventionist strategy . Russia's actions in Ukraine, while still in full swing, signal nothing less than the maturing of a new and interventionist strategy. Resembling the original Brezhnev doctrine, the Kremlin seems fully resolved now to interfere with any of its post-Soviet neighbors, should they chose a political model at home or affiliations abroad that differ from what Moscow proposes: autocracy from within, and Eurasian integration from without. Renegades in turn, such as Ukraine after the ouster of Viktor Yanukovych, that venture towards democracy and EU integration, will face Russian retaliation designed to threaten their very existence. This strategy has been in the making for a decade. Once President Putin had established his full authoritarian rule, tamed the oligarchs and controlled the economy, and basked in oil and gas revenues, the Kremlin started to move on its neighbors. Most of these had long remained in a twilight -- some shaky democracies, others semi-dictatorships, all oscillating between East and West -- until Russia attended to them. It propped up odious dictators from Belarus to Kazakhstan with financial and political backing. It punished defectors from Moldova to Ukraine with gas cut-offs, trade embargoes, and propaganda wars. It ""passportized"" citizens of Georgia and found their rights violated, only to send its military to the rescue. In short, Russia has long tested and refined an arsenal of coercion that can be applied to any of its smaller neighbors politically and economically, socially and culturally, legally and if need be, militarily. Yet the Kremlin discovered that, besides direct measures against its neighbors, action was needed on additional stages. For years now, Russia has hollowed out international organizations, such as the OSCE or the Council of Europe, by blocking their budgets, manipulating parliamentary assemblies, and dispatching rival monitors. Foreign donors, from development aid agencies to private foundations, were squeezed out from Russia, Belarus and elsewhere to weaken civil society and independent media. Russian business massively expanded its reach into the EU, wooed individual countries with lucrative deals from pipelines in Germany to nuclear energy in Hungary to French military supplies, and infiltrated EU capitals with a myriad of lobbyists. It should hardly surprising, then, that European responses to Russia's increasingly aggressive behavior have been muffled at best. What may long have been a cocktail of stand-alone and ad-hoc actions to increase Russian influence over its neighbors, and to curtail that of Europe, has now become a fully-fledged doctrine with Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency in 2012. Since then, the Kremlin has both formalized its ambitions and backed them up ideologically. On a formal level, it launched the Eurasian Union, an integration project to return former Soviet republics to Russian hegemony and to prevent them from moving closer to the EU. On an ideological level, Moscow dressed its policy as a civilizational struggle of its own superior model of a strong state and controlled society with the weak and degenerate liberal democracies of Europe. In so doing, Russia has formulated the political goal and justification needed for employing its many pressure tools systematically and strategically. Kremlin emboldened . In this light, the current Russian intervention in Ukraine is neither the impulsive overreaction of the Kremlin to the loss of an ally, nor result of Vladimir Putin's deficient touch with reality. On the contrary, it is the full application of a strategy that has long been in the making. The only novelty is that, with the planned incorporation of Crimea into the Russian Federation, this doctrine is now taken to the ultimate end: the redrawing of borders in the post-Soviet space. In so doing, Russia threatens all of its neighbors and challenges the European order as such. Nothing so far suggests that Russia will limit itself in these aspirations. After years of pressuring neighbors without much resistance, the Kremlin feels emboldened in its strategy and has little reason for self-restraint. Moscow's aggressive quest for its ""near abroad"" has become an ideological mission to fight the West, one that has left all rational grounds and that ignores all costs and consequences, including those to Russia itself. Opposition to this policy within Russia is effectively non-existent, as decisions are taken by a small circle of hardliners, parliament serves to rubber-stamp them, and civil society and independent media have been silenced. Ordinary Russians, in turn, overwhelmingly support Putin's actions and assertiveness, at over two-thirds according to recent polls. In this situation, brakes on Russian interventionism can only be imposed from outside. Ukrainians have given a powerful example of resistance, through the courage of hundreds of thousands of protesters and the remarkable moderation of their new government in the face of Russian provocations. Yet Ukraine, and no less other neighbors such as Georgia and Moldova that have equally chosen a path of democracy and European integration, will not be able to resist mounting Russian aggressiveness. Only Europe, in concert with the United States, can put a check on the Putin doctrine before it drags the Eastern half of the continent into the abyss. European response . Europe's first immediate response, as is becoming clear even to its most reluctant leaders, must be a range of sanctions against Russia. The EU has rightly tried for negotiations first but has to acknowledge now that the Kremlin flatly refuses any talks and compromise. Europe must now roll out travel bans and asset freezes against those in the Russian leadership who are directly responsible for this escalation, followed by a swift extension to include the 300 or so influentials, and their families, who control much of the country's politics and business today. In a next step, and depending on Russia's response, Europe should impose a range of economic sanctions, halt arms and technology exports to Russia, stop sales of Russian-held real estate in the EU, pause preparations of strategic infrastructure projects such as Russian pipelines to Europe, and subject key Russian business operations to the full scrutiny and regulatory power of the EU. In parallel, Europe must sign the association and free trade agreements with Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia within weeks. A snap summit of EU leaders could be held in Kiev that, ideally, would finally state the long-overdue EU membership perspective for Eastern neighbors, and substantiate this prospect with a comprehensive assistance package to see would-be members through the political, economic and social reforms necessary for European integration. Politically and materially, this would send a strong signal of commitment to Europe's East, and one that Russia will find hard to match. Other, more medium and long-term steps would have to follow. EU measures will have to be taken to enhance the economic, energy, cyber and hard security of those Eastern European countries -- new EU members as well as neighbors -- that are particularly exposed to Russian pressures. Europe's Eastern policy will have to be reformulated, based on the acknowledgment that the EU is now in direct competition with Russia. Its neighborhood policy will have to be redefined as an enlargement policy, while its Russia strategy can no longer be based on the illusion of partnership. Economic ties with Russia, whether its oil and gas imports or business activities in the EU, will have to be reconsidered. And Europe's multinational institutions, whether OSCE, Council of Europe or NATO, must be strengthened and empowered to once again serve as guarantors of collective development and security -- open but not hostage to Russia. This is an enormous agenda, comparable only to the challenge of reuniting Europe after the end of the Cold War. Much as it successfully answered that call, the EU must now muster the political will, foresight and vision to save its Eastern neighborhood from falling victim to the Putin doctrine.

"London (CNN) -- Thousands of homes are under threat, rail services have been canceled, and soldiers have been called in to boost flood defenses as Britain braces for more devastating rain. Authorities in the UK spent the weekend battling widespread flooding in the south and west of the country, areas among the hardest hit by heavy storms in Britain, Ireland and northwestern France. The Environment Agency has issued 14 severe flood warnings along the River Thames in southern England, where it said river levels that were already extremely high were forecast to continue to rise. Britain has been hit by bad weather since early December, namely powerful gales and torrential downpours, and swaths of southwestern England have been flooded, forcing many out of their homes. And there is no letup just yet. ""Extreme weather will continue to threaten communities this week, with further severe flooding expected Monday evening into Tuesday along the Thames in Berkshire and Surrey,"" Paul Leinster, chief executive of the Environment Agency, said in a statement. ""River levels are high across south west, central and southern England and further rain has the potential to cause significant flooding."" Wettest January in 248 years . England suffered the wettest January since 1766, and the Environment Agency said it is also moving toward the wettest winter in 250 years. Gusts of up to 80 mph, heavy rain and massive waves have made up the latest extreme weather coming from the Atlantic Ocean and driven, meteorologists say, by a long and powerful polar vortex. Hundreds of people have already been forced out of their homes. And with the ground heavily saturated, any more rain will increase the flood risk across the country. Soldiers have been deployed to some of the most affected areas to boost flood defenses by filling and stacking sandbags. Rivers have burst their banks, submerging nearby trees and benches and threatening properties. 'Major Incident' Alongside the River Thames, some villages saw their main streets already flooded and thousands of homes were under threat. Some residents paddled canoes or pushed wheelbarrows filled with belongings down residential streets. ""Police have declared the flooding situation in Thames Valley a Major Incident and continue to work with partners to help local communities,"" Thames Valley police tweeted. Train connections have also been disrupted as the strong winds and heavy rain have caused flooding, landslides and obstructions on railways. ""At the moment Eastbury and Purley on Thames -- two of several areas which are on flood alert -- they're actually flooded,"" Peta Stoddart-Crompton, of West Berkshire Council, said. ""We've got the military helping us. We're right in the middle of a crisis. People have had to leave their homes. We have been in an emergency situation for a few days now. We've had our emergency center open."" Government under pressure . The government has come under pressure for its handling of the storms battering Britain. Parts of some areas have been underwater for more than a month, with angry residents criticizing the government for not doing enough to prevent flooding or not reacting quickly enough to help those affected by the devastation. Prime Minister David Cameron has announced extra funding for flood defense repairs and maintenance. ""We will keep providing whatever immediate practical support and assistance is needed, whether that is extra pumps and sandbags; military support on the ground; emergency funds from the new ÃÂ£7 million ($11.5 million) severe weather assistance fund for local councils,"" he said in a statement. Cameron traveled to some of the affected areas Monday. Another meeting of the government's emergency committee was scheduled for later on Monday.

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican Rep. Vern Buchanan, a self-made Florida millionaire, is only in his third term in Congress, but he already is in charge of fundraising for the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, and he sits on the powerful House Ways and Means committee. But all that could be jeopardized. Federal investigations underway could result in Buchanan serving his next term behind bars. CNN has confirmed there are no fewer than four congressional and federal investigations into Buchanan's business practices, his campaign finances and his alleged attempt to try to stop a witness from talking. Congress: Same hours, half the work . Now that witness is stepping forward in an exclusive interview with CNN. Buchanan's former business partner says the congressman schemed to launder money from his car dealerships into his campaign coffers, and then tried to get others to cover it up. Many of the questions surrounding Buchanan go back to his auto dealerships in Florida where he made his millions, and back to the days when he worked with his former business partner Sam Kazran. Their partnership started at what is now a weed-filled lot, the former North Jacksonville Hyundai dealership. Eventually they owned four dealerships together. ""I respected him,"" Kazran says of their early years together. ""I believed him."" But Kazran says he was naive, and that he soon found out the man he believed in was interested in only two things: money and power. ""Mr. Buchanan is a very selfish person, and in my opinion people who go to Congress have got to do good for the people they represent,"" Kazran says. Kazran presented to CNN the same information, documents and testimony he has given to federal investigators. The two men had a falling out over their finances, and they've been suing each other for years. Buchanan says Kazran is a disgruntled partner and has lied about what happened. At the center of Kazran's allegations is a cash swap scheme used to finance some of Buchanan's campaigns. He says employees were forced to write checks, then were reimbursed with cash drawn from Buchanan's car dealerships. ""It was to a point where I said, 'Chief, we can't give you this kind of money. At which point he said, 'Just run it through the corporation,'"" Kazran said. ""What he said to me was 'Get people to write a check to the campaign and then pay them back through the corporation.'"" Kazran did, and he was soon calling in managers, salesman, even assistants. People who never gave money to campaigns were suddenly writing big checks to Buchanan for Congress and, according to Kazran, getting reimbursed from the dealership. It added up to almost $70,000 at Kazran's dealership alone, he said. Senate close to deal to extend low interest rates on student loans . ""I remember one of the partners jokingly saying, 'Boss, you have all the money in the world. Why do you want us to pay you the money?'Â And he said,Â 'Well, it doesn't look good if it's coming from me.'"" Kazran took his detailed allegations to the Federal Elections Commission, which was already looking into Buchanan's campaign finances. Investigators there wanted to know not only about how the cash-swap scheme was set up, but if the congressman knew about it. Kazran says there is no question the congressman knew all about it. The FEC's initial report found ""reason to believe"" that Buchanan ""knowingly and willfully violated"" federal election laws. Read the initial FEC report (pdf). But in a later report the FEC pulled back, saying it found credibility problems with both Kazran and Buchanan and not enough corroborating evidence to back up Kazran's testimony. The FEC then dropped the investigation into Buchanan, stating, ""While there is some other evidence in the record that is consistent with Kazran's general allegations, other evidence supports Buchanan's denials or is ambiguous."" Read the FEC report (pdf). The FEC eventually fined Kazran $5,000 in a settlement because he admitted reimbursing employees for campaign contributions. Kazran has never disputed his involvement, but he says he did it because Buchanan told him to. While the congressman has said the later FEC report proves he's innocent, the findings at the FEC were more convoluted, stating it came ""close to supporting a finding that it is more likely than not"" that Buchanan violated the law. And that's where things get much more serious for the congressman. During the FEC probe, Buchanan pushed to settle a lawsuit Kazran had brought against him. At the last minute, with a $2.9 million settlement offer from Buchanan dangling in front of him, Kazran says he was given an affidavit to sign. According to Kazran, the congressman and his attorneys were asking him to sign a statement that was a lie, that Buchanan knew nothing about the campaign cash swap. Kazran says Buchanan and his team were trying to force him to lie about Buchanan's role in the campaign cash scheme in exchange for the nearly $3 million cash settlement, money which Kazran says he desperately needed, as his finances were in trouble and his wife was suffering from cancer and was undergoing expensive medical treatments. ""A lot of the language of it was really to distance himself...,"" said Kazran. ""In short it said that Mr. Buchanan had nothing to do with it."" Kazran's lawyer, Robert Stok, says it was clearly an effort to lean on Kazran when he was vulnerable. ""He was holding the settlement in escrow,"" Stok says. ""He basically said, 'We can settle, but there's one little thing remaining. All you have to do is sign this affidavit. We release the settlement and everything will be rosy for you.'"" Kazran refused to sign and took the affidavit to federal investigators. Now, CNN has learned that Buchanan is being investigated for attempting to tamper with a witness in a federal investigation. After CNN's repeated requests for interviews were ignored, CNN decided to find Buchanan as he emerged from a hearing. Buchanan would not respond fully to any questions and quickly walked away from CNN's camera. When asked if he tried to get Kazran to sign the affidavit, Buchanan responded ""No, no, no, no. No I didn't,"" adding that he needed to get to another meeting, and that CNN should contact his office. When asked if he used the affidavit to hold up the $3 million settlement with Kazran, Buchanan replied: ""No."" In a recent report, released quietly several weeks ago, the Office of Congressional Ethics wrote:Â ""There is substantial reason to believe that Buchanan attempted to influence the testimony of a witness in a proceeding before the FEC in violation""Â of federal law and House ethics code. Read the OCE's report on the affidavit (pdf). Now a full House ethics committee is looking into it. CNN has also learned that the FBI is conducting its own investigation. In addition, the Office of Congressional Ethics also found ""substantial reason to believe"" that Buchanan failed to disclose unearned income on his financial disclosure forms from 2007 to 2010. Read the report (pdf). Salvatore Rosa, a former chief financial officer for Buchanan's business interests for five years, said in a recent deposition conducted by Buchanan's attorney that he submitted a federal whistle-blower complaintÂ to the IRS with allegations that Buchanan violated federal tax laws, including tax evasion, fraud and conspiracy to commit tax evasion. In the deposition, Buchanan's attorneys asked Rosa if he stood to gain a ""financial windfall"" by filing the complaint. Rosa said ""potentially."" The deposition did not provide details of the alleged violations of tax law. Rosa declined an interview with CNN. Buchanan's office responded to CNN's interview request with a statement saying the charges are ""politically motivated,"" that the congressman did nothing wrong, and ""We are confident that the Justice Department and House Ethics Committee will reach the same conclusion."" On Friday, lawyers for Buchanan filed a legal motion in Sarasota, Florida, to seal all documents in the Kazran case and to stop Kazran and his lawyers from speaking publicly about it. Buchanan's lawyers said news stories about the congressman are ""publicly disparaging"" his character. Stok said: ""As an American citizen, both Congressman Buchanan and I have the fundamental right of free speech. ... Mr. Buchanan's motion is yet another in a series of frivolous efforts to attempt to shut down the case ... and to conceal his wrongdoing behind a shroud of secrecy.""

"(CNN) -- If that last beer made you feel a little warm and fuzzy inside, it could be because you just did some good. You may have just donated to a charity, just by buying a drink. I first noticed this philanthropy trend while enjoying a new limited release IPA from Sweetwater Brewery called Second Helping. The name implies having more, and the compelling flavoring of juniper berries and chocolate malts had already sold me on that proposition. But then I read the beer's label and learned that it was crafted to benefit a charity called The Giving Kitchen, which helps people in the food industry going through hard times. This initiative was inspired by Atlanta chef Ryan Hidinger, who brought the Atlanta restaurant community together when he fought and ultimately lost his battle with cancer. His wife and friends decided to take the generous funds that were raised to help Ryan and pay it forward by creating this charity. I admit that it got me when I read that the juniper berries were added for Ryan, because he so enjoyed cooking with them. Steve Farace, Sweetwater's Director of Marketing, says that 100% of the profits from this beer will be donated to The Giving Kitchen. ""We saw it as an opportunity to help the folks in the hospitality industry that helped build our brand through word of mouth."" Sweetwater has sold every drop, and it is already hard to find a bar that still has any left to serve. Trust me, I've looked. Sweetwater already knew their customers' thirst for a cause-worthy beer. Each summer they launch a Save Our Water campaign with the release of Waterkeeper Hefeweizen. Bar patrons annually show their support for this by purchasing paper fish that decorate the walls and ceilings of bars throughout the Southeast. Beer lovers looking for a charitable ale available year round, can head to Minneapolis and ask for a Finnegans. The brewery boasts an Irish Amber and a Blonde Ale which both come with a prepared toast on the label: ""Here's to doing good."" 100% of the profits of the Finnegans beer company goes directly into their nonprofit, the Finnegans Community Fund. This initiative purchases food from area farmers, which is distributed to food bank partners in Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota and South Dakota. Finnegans' CEO Jacquie Berglund sums it up this way: ""At Finnegan's we turn beer into food. That is our mission."" Berglund says their community's response has gone beyond just drinking beer. ""A lot of people follow us for our social mission. We have 1500 volunteers that come not for beer, but to help pack food at the food banks."" Not to discount the bar patrons' efforts, Jacquie quickly adds that the key to their success is still and has always been the creating of a tasty beer that gives people an opportunity to make a difference. Just as brewers have tapped into the cause-oriented audience, bars are also finding ways to reach out to them, and to make their own impact. Customers at the OKRA Charity Saloon in Houston, drinkers don't have to choose a specific beer to be charitable; they just select a cause. Each month the bar - which is run as a joint operation by numerous Houston restaurateurs and bar owners - selects four local nonprofits. The one that receives the most votes will receive 100% of the saloon's profits from the next month. It's like an election, but with alcohol. OKRA's Lindsey Brown explains, ""When you buy a beer or some food, you are given a ticket. You then drop the ticket into one of the four voting boxes, whichever charity you choose."" This unique concept has made the OKRA Saloon very popular. The competing nonprofits encourage their communities to visit the bar so they will get votes, and the winning nonprofit encourages everybody to visit the following month, because they will be getting all the profits donated to them. Lindsey adds that this also creates an alternative way to help. ""It makes giving more fun, more interactive. If you are just writing a check you don't feel engaged, but when you are standing at our voting booth, you feel like you are making an impact."" If you don't want a vote to decide where your donation goes, then travel to Portland and choose one from a special menu at Oregon Public House. After ordering food or drink at this bar, patrons then pick one of the six nonprofits detailed on their Charity Menu. 100% of the profit from each sale goes to the selected organization. Ryan Saari, the Director for Oregon Public House, says this excites some of his customers who realize in that moment that they just made a difference. ""They feel empowered, and then they start recommending their choice to other customers, and even share the nonprofit's vision that they just read about a moment before. That's not your typical bar banter, and I think it is a huge win."" While no one is advocating for bar fights over whose charity is better, it is exciting to see the drinking crowd engaged in philanthropy. These opportunities to give beer buffs an opportunity to do good is already proving to be a benefit for the industry, nonprofits and the communities they serve. And as more bars and breweries join this trend, the idea of giving back can be introduced and embraced with each round, as it was with me and that glass of Second Helping. However this disclaimer is warranted: All of these organizations offer ways to help, donate and make a difference that does not require alcohol, and donating through drinking does not excuse alcohol abuse or irresponsibility. If you won't take my word for it, take heed from this satirical warning from Stephen Colbert. And for more ways to make a difference, alcohol free, visit CNN's Impact Your World.

"(CNN) -- Faced with a growing backlash from entertainers and others responding to a documentary film claiming mistreatment of whales, SeaWorld bought full-page ads in newspapers nationwide Friday to call the accounts inaccurate and paint its employees as ""true animal advocates."" ""The truth about SeaWorld is right here in our parks and people,"" the company said in the ad, which appeared in The New York Times and other papers. PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) immediately issued a statement challenging the accuracy of the ads and encouraging people, ""Please don't fall for it."" SeaWorld has been battered in recent weeks since the television premiere of the documentary ""Blackfish"" on CNN. The movie traces a 39-year history of killer whales in captivity, leading up to the 2010 killing of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by the 12,000-pound orca Tilikum -- a whale previously associated with the death of two other people. Filmmaker Gabriela Cowperthwaite said the documentary team's research for the film shows the whales suffer from boredom and stress and are unsuitable for life in captivity. A number of entertainers, including Heart, Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies and country music singers Martina McBride and Willie Nelson, canceled appearances at SeaWorld after the airing. A Malibu, California, school recently canceled its annual overnight field trip to the park after students spoke out in opposition, and a San Diego, California, high school cinema class posted a video to YouTube with students pledging to spend no more money at SeaWorld until the company changes its practices. 'Blackfish' prompts school to cancel longstanding SeaWorld trip . Social media sites critical of SeaWorld also are filled with comments from people vowing they'll never go to the parks again after viewing the film. SeaWorld has consistently rejected the ""Blackfish"" accusations, including in statements to CNN, but the ads published Friday are perhaps its most visible effort to defend itself. In its ad, also posted to its website, SeaWorld: . â¢ Denied accusations that it captures killer whales in the wild, saying it last did so 35 years ago. â¢ Said it does not separate whale calves from their mothers except for ""the rare occasion that a mother killer whale cannot care for the calf herself."" â¢ Rejected claims that its whales suffer shortened lifespans. â¢ Argued its work with universities, governments and nonprofits has helped advance scientific understanding of killer whales in the wild, and said it has spent $70 million in recent years on habitats, which it calls ""among the largest in the world today."" The statement released by PETA challenged SeaWorld's claims. For instance, the animal rights group said, ""Although SeaWorld is right in stating that five of its whales have life spans similar to those of orcas in the wild, it fails to note that nearly every other orca at SeaWorld -- some 35 of them -- has died prematurely from violent accidents, preventable injuries, illnesses caused by stressful living conditions, and more."" In its ad, SeaWorld says, ""Our guests may enter our gates having never given much thought to the remarkable animals in our oceans ... When they leave with a greater appreciation for the importance of the sea, educated about the animals that live there and inspired to make a difference, we have done our job."" The problem, notes crisis communications expert David Johnson, is that some of those former guests are finding themselves increasingly uncomfortable about their affection for SeaWorld, and are willing to share their squeamishness with the world. For instance, on YouTube, students from a Point Loma, San Diego, high school recount their happy memories at SeaWorld before promising to stay away until the park changes its polices. In another video, a 5-year-old boy talks of how the film made him angry about SeaWorld's treatment of whales. While SeaWorld can get along without entertainers, widely watched images of children rejecting field trips to the parks will be more troublesome, Johnson said. ""Oh, it's really damaging,"" he said. Evidence of whether that proves to be the case could be revealed in February, when the company should next file quarterly reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission showing its financial performance for the quarter that included the CNN airings of ""Blackfish."" The company depends entirely on admissions and concession sales for its revenues, which totaled $538.4 million in the three months that ended on September 30.

"(CNN) -- Compared with their U.S. peers, Taobao versus eBay, JD.com versus Amazon, Suning vs. Walmart, the Chinese leading e-commerce players have a much shorter history. However, they will take a bigger e-commerce share from the overall retail space soon. Unlike in the United States, most smaller cities in China have not been penetrated by organized retailers or consumer brands yet. This offers an opportunity for e-commerce to become the mainstream retail format for these cities. Another reason is that the cost of commercial property in China went up significantly in the last decade. Thus, consumer brands and retail merchants are more encouraged to migrate online while in the United States, offline to online migration is mainly driven by labor cost and efficiency request. If not in 2013, no later than 2014, China's e-commerce will have a bigger gross merchandise volume than in the United States. Please be aware that China's total retail sales is still much smaller than the U.S., which further demonstrates that e-commerce's share in China will be much more significant. 2015, a breakthrough year for e-commerce in China . Why 2015? We need to understand the emerging cyber history in China. Almost all of China's leading Internet players' birthdays are in 1999, including Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, Sina and Sohu, etc. In other words, there were no Internet applications until 2000. People born on or after 1980 were over 20 years old in by 2000. They started to get access to the Internet mostly after their campus lives. We call them a generation working in Internet. Take a look at people born on or after 1985. They were teenagers in 2000 when the Internet was just getting started in China. This post-1985 generation is one that lives on the Internet, and started from social, gaming to almost everything. By 2015, this post-1985 generation is reaching their 30s and becoming the core consumer group for almost every category. They have already migrated to the virtual space and they are the mainstream consumption power in China. E-commerce will take such consumption power and make offline retail even weaker. Different ecommerce business model is a MUST . Although I put Taobao.com versus eBay, JD.com vs. Amazon.com, Suning versus Walmart into respective peer group, they do not run the same business models and they don't even look similar anymore. Why the e-commerce model needs to be so different, we need to answer this question from a consumer angle and a merchant angle. As we mentioned above, Chinese Internet consumers are younger, and they're not mainstream yet. Most of them have never been served by organized, retailed or consumer brands yet. Taobao.com can evolve from an online flea market to T-mall and become the shopping entry portal, while eBay finds itself having difficulty getting rid of its secondhand products from its auction site. From a merchant's point of view, there are millions of small but professional merchants in China, they will not just fill up Taobao.com but they will also flood into JD.com and Suning.com and become a major sales force in China. Any e-commerce platform's success depends on winning these millions of merchants and they will make the pure online retail model very difficult in China. Behind these millions of merchants are hundreds of thousands of factories in China. This is why such phenomenon does not exist in the United States where you can hardly find any manufacturers. The monetization model in China for e-commerce is also very different. Advertising model is better accepted by millions of small merchants rather than transaction fee or listing fees. Even service powered by e-commerce needs a different model and will have a different future. When Groupon is under challenge in the United States, I believe that few Chinese survivors, like Meituan.com, from thousands of Chinese Groupons will have a brighter future than its original. The brighter future is based on at least one-third of restaurants and other small and medium business changing hands every year and their ongoing marketing demand will offer companies like Meituan.com almost endless merchants list for promotion. On the other hand, the price sensitive consumers will be addicted to such service. Winning tips for foreign players in China . Google, Yahoo, eBay, Amazon, and Groupon, as part of a very long list of U.S. Internet and e-commerce giants, have tried different ways through set-up by themselves, acquisition, joint venture with local key players, none of them can claim any success in China yet. Unlike other Internet applications, the e-commerce sector is least regulated and restricted by Chinese authorities in comparison to other Internet verticals. In my opinion, U.S. players cannot offer the real value to local consumers since their global technology and supply chain advantage cannot be leveraged in China. The cross-border management slows down the quick reaction required in this fast-moving market. My advice for U.S. players is to humbly buy in minority shares in some emerging Chinese e-commerce players and focus on cross-border synergies, such as cross-border tourism, education or shopping behaviors, etc. These cross-border activities will be growing more rapidly and such synergy can really leverage U.S. peers' strength and offer real value to Chinese consumers.","Unlike U.S., China has not been penetrated by organized retailers or brands yet .

"(CNN) -- Not so much the Chosen One, more the Disastrous One. From the get go, David Moyes struggled in getting to grips with the task of managing Manchester United and less than a year after succeeding the legendary Alex Ferguson, the Scot has been sacked just 10 months into a six-year contract. It's an old adage that Rome wasn't built in a day -- but it did burn in seven nights. With that in mind, here are the big mistakes made by Moyes during his turbulent Old Trafford tenure with the club now left fighting all sorts of fires both off and on the pitch. Marouane Fellaini . Less the elephant in the room, more the uncomfortable, luxuriously-haired disaster in the United midfield. The Belgian international followed Moyes to Manchester from Everton in September 2013 and he signaled the new manager's first foray into the transfer market. It smacked of a toddler reaching for its comfort blanket. Fellaini's Â£27.5 million price tag always looked on the large side and it has only inflated with each of his underwhelming performances. The nadir of the 27-year-old's debut campaign at Old Trafford arrived earlier this month, during an abject showing in a European Champions League tie against Bayern Munich. Spanish newspaper AS was so unimpressed with Fellaini's showing in the 1-1 draw that it refused to give him a mark in the player ratings section of its match report. With a new manager likely to arrive with fresh ideas, it could be a matter of time before Fellaini follows Moyes out of the door. Local laughing stock . United fans hate losing to Manchester City. And they despise defeat to Liverpool. Losing to one of those two teams is unacceptable, losing to both twice in the same season was previously unthinkable. Somehow Moyes' team managed the unthinkable as the Scot presided over four defeats in four matches against United's two fiercest rivals, with an aggregate score of 11-1. Even worse, Liverpool, the club Ferguson successfully knocked off their ""f***ing perch,"" look set to win a first league title in 24 years, while United have failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1995. As for City, once referred to by Ferguson as United's ""noisy neighbors,"" the blue half of Manchester is currently 17 points ahead of the red half after also winning the League Cup final. Last season Ferguson's team wrapped up a 20th league title for the club, finishing 11 points clear of City in second place. Under Moyes, United never looked like troubling the top of the table. So no surprise then that the joke doing the rounds on Tuesday after Moyes' dismissal was that police had been called to Old Trafford to stop Liverpool and City fans protesting over his sacking. Tactics? What tactics?! Easy and straightforward to defend against. That was how Fulham, who had lost eight of their previous 11 Premier League games prior to a 2-2 draw against United in February, described the tactics employed by Moyes. After the match, United were damned by statistics. Moyes' men flung 81 crosses into the Fulham penalty area, evidence -- his critics suggested -- that the United manager was a tactical neanderthal. After watching Ferguson's team tear into the opposition for over two decades, fans found this ""back to basics"" brand of football hard to stomach. Moyes' reported focus on fitness and conditioning in training also backfired. Rather than looking energetic on the pitch, United too often resembled the battery-powered bunny beaten to the line by its Duracell-fueled rival. Other brands of battery are available. So are other managers. Problem players . Moyes inherited a squad which had just won the Premier League title at a canter, but he struggled to get the best out of stars like Wayne Rooney. Tying Rooney down to a new five-and-a-half year deal in February, rumored to be worth an eye-watering $500,000 per week, was seen as something of a coup by the club. But the truth is that Rooney has rarely looked worthy of such a lavish investment. The 28-year-old may have scored 15 Premier League goals this season, but too often he has put in displays well below his dazzling best. The signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea was supposed to add flair and purpose to United's attack, but the Spaniard has only shown flashes of his undoubted talent since arriving in January. People joked that giving Moyes the present of Mata was like giving your granddad an IPad for Christmas. Moyes' failure to coax the best out of these players, and gifted technicians like Shinji Kagawa, further contributed to his demise. Small-club mentality . ""I didn't get the chance to say yes or no,"" Moyes said in July. ""As you can imagine, the blood drained from my face. I was shocked."" He might sound like someone describing death by lethal injection, but this is the tale of how the Scot became United manager. ""It was a strange situation,"" he added. ""I had no idea whatsoever until Sir Alex gave me a call and asked me to come to his house. ""I was expecting him to say, 'I'm going to take one of your players' or something else. I went in and the first thing he said to me was, 'I'm retiring'. ""I said, 'When?' because he was never retiring, and he said, 'Next week!' His next words were, 'You're the next Manchester United manager'."" The sad truth is that Moyes never chose to be the United manager and, at times, he resembled a rabbit caught in a car's headlights. While 11 years at Everton earned him the respect of the football fraternity, Moyes never seemed to come to terms with the scale of his new role. ""I don't know what we have to do to win,"" Moyes said after a defeat to Stoke in February. A quote which unintentionally encapsulates his troubled reign.","David Moyes is dismissed after less than a year in charge of English league titleholder .

"(CNN) -- As someone who has had the great honor of commanding four different ships for the United States Coast Guard, I have watched the news about the Costa Concordia -- the grounding of the vessel and the resulting death of at least 11 people -- from the perspective of a seagoing captain. We must all await the findings of a proper investigation, but for anyone remotely familiar with a captain's awesome responsibilities for the lives of his passengers and crew, the reported behavior of the Concordia's skipper, Francesco Schettino, is almost unfathomable. The captain of a ship at sea is one of the last bastions of total authority in this world. The ocean is a dangerous place, where life and death decisions often need to be made in an instant. For this reason, a sea captain is granted complete independence, power, and control aboard his vessel. But with that absolute authority comes absolute responsibility. In the case of a cruise ship, thousands of passengers have come aboard with the expectation that they are in the hands of a competent crew headed by a competent captain. They are depending on his professionalism, skill and dedication to his one and only mission: to navigate his vessel safely and prudently from point A to point B. To meet that mission, a modern sea captain is provided with all kinds of resources. He is given extraordinary training for the challenges of the waters he is in and the vessel he is commanding. He is given extraordinary electronic gadgetry that allows him to fix his position on the globe within inches. He receives all sorts of input information -- weather reports, charts detailing virtually every hazard in his area of operation, and detailed information on pathways to take and pathways to avoid -- all of which arm him to make good judgments as to where he is going. The captain of the Costa Concordia had all these resources at his disposal, and yet audio recordings and other accounts appear to show him violating every commonly accepted notion of how a captain will behave in a crisis. First, he came in close to the island in spite of the obvious navigational challenges that meant in terms of safe passage. It is a captain's responsibility to err on the side of safety. When I commanded Coast Guard cutters undertaking hazardous military missions, I invariably chose the safer path whenever I had the opportunity to do so. The captain of a cruise ship, whose sole mission is the safe transport of your passengers, has no excuse to choose anything but the safest path. Second, the chaos that followed the grounding of the ship appears to reflect the captain's lack of leadership aboard his vessel. By all accounts he failed to institute a command structure in which his crew was prepared to do their duty to organize the passengers for a safe embarkation from a sinking platform -- and as a result, 11 people are dead and more than 20 others are still missing. Third, his personal decision to leave the vessel before his passengers had safely embarked from the ship shows a flagrant disrespect for his ultimate responsibilities as a sea captain. A captain does not necessarily have to go down with his ship, but under no circumstances does he leave his ship to save himself before he has saved those whose lives are in his hands. Given these serial failures of responsibility, the one blessing is that the accident occurred so close to shore, which allowed so many of the passengers to reach safety on their own. One can only imagine how many might have perished had the ship run into trouble at sea with this particular captain and crew. There will be an investigation in the aftermath. But even before it gets under way, one thing is clear: the training and promotion process that put a man like this in command of a passenger ship missed the character flaw that allowed him to jeopardize his vessel for some apparently transient and empty purpose. That promotion system is in need of serious repair. When I first heard about the Costa Concordia, I thought back to the guidance that Alexander Hamilton provided in 1790 to the captains of the first 10 cutters of the U.S. Revenue Marine -- the precursor to the Coast Guard. Hamilton advised that they had been ""selected with careful attention to character"" and told them to ""Refrain from haughtiness, rudeness, or insult"" and to ""Endeavor to overcome difficulties by a cool and temperate perseverance in your duty."" He declared that a captain's demeanor and behavior must ""be marked with prudence, moderation, and good temper. Upon these qualities must depend the success, usefulness and ... continuance of the establishment in which they are included."" An off duty captain, Roberto Bosio, happened to be on board the Costa Concordia when it ran aground and swung into action, helping dozens of women and children into lifeboats. He has been called a hero in the Italian press, but rejects the moniker. ""Don't call me a hero. I just did my duty, the duty of a sea captain,"" he said. Captain Bosio met Alexander Hamilton's charge. Captain Schettino failed to do so in every imaginable way. Join CNN Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on Twitter.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A U.S. military helicopter crashed in southern Iraq early Thursday morning, killing all seven U.S. soldiers on board, the military said. A U.S. Chinook helicopter, similar to this British Chinook, crashed in Iraq, the U.S. military said. Officials have not determined the cause of the crash, but do not suspect hostile activity. ""Based on our initial reports, it is accurate to characterize this as an accident,"" said Maj. John Hall, a U.S. military spokesman. The CH-47 Chinook was part of a four-aircraft convoy that was flying from Kuwait to Balad in northern Iraq. The chopper went down about 62 miles (100 km) west of Basra. The other helicopters in the convoy did not sustain damage, Hall said. The names of the soldiers were not released pending notification of next of kin. The CH-47 Chinook is primarily used for transporting troops, supplies and artillery. Meanwhile, two parked car bombs detonated in western Baghdad Wednesday in quick succession, killing eight people and wounding 25, an Interior Ministry official said. Baghdad was also struck by a series of roadside bombings that killed two and wounded 16, the official said. The bombs detonated in two cars parked near each other outside a hospital in Harthiya district shortly before noon (0900 GMT), the official said. It was the second twin car bomb attack in Baghdad this week. On Monday, two car bombs detonated in central Baghdad, killing 12 and wounding 37. Five roadside bombs struck the Iraqi capital on Wednesday, one of which targeted the head of New Baghdad's district council, the official said. The council leader's driver was killed, while he and his security guard were wounded in the attack. Another roadside bomb in eastern Baghdad killed an Iraqi policeman and wounded five other people. Two other roadside bombings in the Iraqi capital wounded nine Iraqi soldiers and civilians. Elsewhere on Wednesday, an assistant to the governor of Nineveh province was gunned down as he was leaving evening prayers in central Mosul, city police said. Shamel Younis was walking outside the mosque when gunmen in a car shot and killed him, then fled the scene. The new U.S. commander in Iraq said Tuesday that security in the country has improved, but is still in a ""fragile state."" ""As we've said many times, everyone is encouraged by the progress that has been made here in Iraq, but we still have a lot of work to do,"" said Gen. Ray Odierno, who took command of U.S. forces in Iraq on Tuesday.  Watch change of command ceremony Â» . Odierno replaced Gen. David Petraeus, whose tenure saw a reversal in the country's rising violence. ""It's a proud moment for me to be given the responsibility to take command of Multi-National Force-Iraq and continue the mission here in Iraq as we move forward,"" Odierno said in Tuesday's handover ceremony in Baghdad, which was attended by Defense Secretary Robert Gates. ""We are in a fragile state now. What I want to do is build it to a more stable state. And I think we're in the process of doing it. It just takes some time, and it's slow,"" Odierno said. Odierno said he is ""encouraged"" by the growth of Iraqi security forces and the national police. ""We're starting to see signs of some other of the governmental capacities begin to grow, which I think is extremely important,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The Russian army has ceased ordering the famed Kalashnikov rifle for its arsenal and is waiting on a newer model its manufacturer is developing. The army already has more of the weapons than it requires, Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia Nikolai Makarov told Russian media. The inventor of the weapon, Mikhail Kalashnikov, 91, has reportedly been deliberately kept uninformed about the decision. ""We do not want to have it on our conscience and tell him such bad news. He might not live through it,"" Russia's Izvestia newspaper quoted an unnamed friend of Kalashnikov as saying. The legendary weapon, known for its simplicity of operation and maintenance and reliability in extreme conditions -- be they hot, cold, wet or sandy -- has been the weapon of choice for national armies and paramilitary guerrillas alike. Instantly recognizable by its banana-shaped ammunition magazine, the weapon, also known as the AK-47, was invented in 1947 -- AK being a Russian acronym for ""Kalashnikov's machine gun,"" and 47 standing for the year it was invented. The AK-47, along with its various modifications, has been recognized in the Guinness World Records book as being the world's most common machine gun. Licensed and unlicensed versions of the rifle are manufactured in several countries. According to the weapon's manufacturer Izhmash, the rifle is still adopted by armed and special forces in over 100 countries. The weapon was so instrumental in Mozambique's successful rebel movement that its image was incorporated into the national flag. It is also depicted as part of Zimbabwe's coat of arms. In 2009, Kalashnikov told a CNN crew on an excursion to the Izhmash arms assembly plant in the Russian city of Izhevsk that two main qualities describe his machine gun: simplicity and reliability. ""It is a thousand times harder to make simple things than complicated ones,"" he said. ""It is very important because a soldier doesn't have university degrees. He needs a simple and reliable weapon. Just as an academic, for that matter, in a combat situation. There's simply no time to figure how to operate a complicated weapon and press many buttons when the enemy is advancing on you."" When Kalashnikov turned 90 in 2009, the day was celebrated in Russia on a scale akin to a national holiday. He was decorated by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev with the country's highest order, the Hero of Russia. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko and Mike Sefanov contributed to this story.","Russian army has surplus of Kalashnikovs and is waiting on a newer model .

"(CNN) -- Friends have asked Brianne Bricker to be their bridesmaid so many times, that this summer she finally had to say ""no."" It's not that the 24-year-old didn't want to be in her friend's wedding, but after spending more than $5,000 on nine weddings over the last two years, she literally just can't afford one more. ""It's hard, because she's somebody I'd want to have in my wedding,"" Bricker said, referring to the bride she turned down who is a close college friend. But Bricker isn't the only bridesmaid to feel the burden of wedding expenses. After adding up the cost of the dress, accessories, travel expenses, wedding gifts and more, WeddingChannel.com found that it costs about $1,695 to be a bridesmaid. The estimate was based on a 2010 Real Weddings study that surveyed more than 20,000 brides nationwide. The highest expenses include travel to the wedding, shower and bachelorette party, which each can cost an average of $300. Stars talk about ""Bridesmaids"" Many bridesmaids don't realize how quickly the expenses can add up, says Amy Eisinger, associate editor of WeddingChannel.com. ""From the moment they announce the engagement, to the day your friend walks down the aisle, if that's a year and a half, you don't realize that you've spent $1,600,"" she said. As the economy struggles out of a slump, the price of weddings -- and the cost of being a bridesmaid -- is starting to rise. ""We saw the cost go down during the recession because brides were incredibly cost conscious in what they were asking their friends to do,"" Eisinger said. Now, brides are asking for more formal weddings with larger price tags. While women want to be in their best friend's wedding, some just can't spend all their savings on the big day. So how do you break it to the bride that you can't be her bridesmaid? ""Be honest up front,"" says Jodi R.R. Smith, author of ""The Etiquette Book,"" which includes advice on everything from the proper music selection to the wording on wedding invitations. ""If you try to be able to do it, then you end up maxing out your credit cards and going into debt,"" Smith said. ""You should never be going into debt for a friend's wedding."" Smith advises women to turn down bridesmaid offers in person, but never during a wedding-related event like the bridal shower. Instead, grab coffee or find a time to talk outside of work. Don't ""throw a fit"" about the expenses, but just tell the truth, Eisinger says. ""You are allowed to say, 'Look, I'm just not going to be able to afford the $200 wedding dress and the trip to Mexico for the bachelorette party and the fact that it's a destination wedding in Key West,' "" she said. Destination weddings and honeymoons . Brides who want their friends to walk down the aisle with them will probably offer to pay for expenses like the dress or plane ticket to the wedding, Smith said. ""If it's a choice between having somebody be in your wedding party or having them all wear designer bridesmaid dresses, I would choose the people and the cheaper bridesmaid dress,"" Smith said. Bridesmaid Christina Barkel was allowed to pick her own dress for a wedding  as long as it was royal blue. After months of scouring sale racks and thrift stores, she found the perfect dress for only $40. Barkel, an AmeriCorps member who earns a small stipend, is paying for only the dress and $450 plane ticket from Michigan to California to be in her friend's wedding in San Diego. Barkel said the bride offered to pay for three of her four nights in a hotel because she understands Barkel can't afford the expense. Knowing what bridesmaids can and can't afford can be a tricky situation for brides. It's not polite to ask directly, so Smith advises brides to give a spreadsheet with an estimated cost of expenses to their bridesmaids. That way, women can see if their bank accounts can handle the final total. More ""Bridesmaids"" coming down the aisles? But like in the movie ""Bridesmaids,"" unexpected surprises like a bachelorette party in Las Vegas do happen. In these cases, bridesmaids shouldn't be shy to offer alternatives. ""Instead of the bachelorette party in Vegas, [if] you're all East Coast people, have it in Atlantic City,"" Smith says. University of Michigan graduate student Katie Okonowski, 23, will be a bridesmaid in her younger sister's wedding next spring. Okonowski said she was thrilled to hear that her sister chose a venue in their hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. ""The fact that it's not out of town, and I don't have to pay for a hotel or travel cost, is really a big cost saver,"" she said. Travel is the biggest expense, but bridesmaids shell out an average of $75 for shoes and another $60 for jewelry, according to the Wedding Channel study. Tack on $100 for manicures, hair and makeup. Celebrity wedding gowns through the decades . Katie Tobin, a 26-year-old student at Loyola University's Law School, is attending nine weddings this summer and is a bridesmaid for two of them. She's having a relative do her hair for her friend's wedding after the previous hair salon bill was twice as much as expected. Tobin said she feels ""a little overwhelmed"" with wedding costs because there are so many at once, and she estimates that she'll spend close to $1,300 as a bridesmaid. While she's using her savings to pay for the dresses and bachelorette parties, she can afford only inexpensive kitchen accessories as wedding gifts. ""I'm still in law school, so luckily, my friends understand I can't do anything too extravagant giftwise,"" she said. Bricker, whose friends compare her to the main character in""27 Dresses,"" says she has had second thoughts about being in some of the weddings in which she wasn't as close to the bride. ""I think you underestimate how much it's going to cost,"" she said with a knowing laugh. ""To be honest, it's probably some of the reason that I'm as poor as I am."" Being a bridesmaid drained my bank account . Tips for bridesmaids on a budget . 1) The dress: If the bride picks a dress that costs $300, don't feel like you don't have any right to speak up. Do a little research, and see if you can find a similar dress that costs less, Eisinger suggests. Or suggest to the bride that she choose a color and you pick your own dress. That way, you can find something more affordable. 2) Party planning: Hold the bridal shower and bachelorette party on the same weekend so you don't have to fly somewhere two separate weekends. 3) Gifts: Consider group gifting when it comes time to buy the gift for the bridal shower and for the wedding. 4) Lodging: If you're going to stay in a hotel room, find out who the other single girls are in the bridal party or ask the bride if she has any other single friends who will be coming. Then find out if you can split a hotel room with another girl so you're cutting back on hotel costs. 5) Balancing the budget: At the very beginning, come up with a total number of how much you want to spend on the wedding, and then keep a running tab somewhere on your computer or your iPhone of how much you're really spending. If the wedding is spread out over the course of a year and a half, that will help you keep your spending more in check.","Bridesmaids spend about $1,695 for dress, travel, gifts and other expenses, website says .

"(Mental Floss) -- Sadly, the down economy has put a lot of workers over age 50 in the unenviable position of needing to find a new profession. Don't believe that old clichÃ© about middle-aged dogs and new tricks, though; lots of wildly successful people found big success in careers they began after their fiftieth birthdays. Here are just a few examples. 1. Colonel Sanders . Harland Sanders was no slouch as a young man, but he didn't become the string-tied chicken mogul we know and love until he was 65. ""The Colonel"" had a relatively successful restaurant and motel on U.S. 25 in Corbin, Kentucky, but when Interstate 75 opened seven miles from Sanders' restaurant, his business begin to dwindle. Rather than go broke, he began to work on perfecting his spice blend and quick-cooking technique for making fried chicken in 1952. He then began touring the country selling Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises, and by the time he sold the business for $2 million in 1964, there were over 900 of them. 2. Jack Cover . You may not recognize Cover's name, but you've surely heard of his invention, the Taser. Cover spent most of his career as a nuclear physicist who worked in aerospace and defense, including playing a significant role in supplying parts for NASA's Apollo project. In 1970 the 50-year-old Cover started Taser, Inc. in an effort to find a weapon that could incapacitate assailants without killing them. He received a patent for his design in 1974, and by 1980 Cover had sold the Los Angeles Police Department on using his new gadget to help apprehend violent suspects. When Cover passed away last year at the age of 88, his device was in use in over 45 countries around the world. 3. Edmond Hoyle . Whether or not you know it, you probably owe Hoyle a tip of the cap each time you reach for a deck of cards. The Englishman is considered to be the world's first technical writer on the rules of card games, and he didn't put pen to paper as a young card sharp. Hoyle was around 70 years old when he first began recording the rules of various card games in 1741; over the last 27 years of his life, his smash hit ""A Short Treatise on the Game of Whist"" went through over a dozen editions. Mental Floss: 8 successful people grateful they got canned . 4. Laura Ingalls Wilder . Wilder's ""Little House on the Prairie"" may be some of the world's most beloved children's books, but she was no spring chicken when she sat down to write them. Wilder didn't publish her first novel until she was 65 years old, but she still managed to crank out one of the most beloved series of all time. 5. Takichiro Mori . You don't have to start early to become the richest man in the world. Mori was an economics professor until he left academia at age 55 to become a real estate investor in 1959. Mori had recently inherited a couple of buildings from his father, and he jumped headfirst into Tokyo's real estate scene. Mori started his second career by investing in the Minato ward where he spent his childhood, and within a matter of years he was presiding over Japan's real estate boom. When Mori died in 1993, he was Forbes' two-time reigning world's richest man with a net worth of around $13 billion. He was something of a Japanese precursor to Warren Buffett, though. Mori never seemed totally comfortable with the fame and fortune his second career won him. He dressed traditionally, abstained from alcohol, and lived a fairly modest life. 6. Grandma Moses . Anna Mary Robertson Moses is one of the biggest names in American folk art, and she didn't even pick up a brush until she was well into her eighth decade. Grandma Moses was originally a big fan of embroidery, but once her arthritis grew too painful for her to hold a needle, she decided to give painting a try in the mid-1930s.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- If somebody pulled out a gun on a crowded train you were riding on, would you notice? These people didn't. Why? They were too into their smartphones, a San Francisco prosecutor says. The September killing of 20-year-old Justin Valdez on that busy train was shocking enough. The shooter, apparently picking the victim at random, shot the San Francisco State University student in the back. Also shocking, the prosecutor says, was the initial actions of bystanders. Or inaction. 800 texts in one week? Diaries of 3 smartphone addicts . ""Some are no more than two to three feet to him,"" said San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon ""We're seeing people that are so disconnected to their surroundings. This is not unique. People are being robbed, people are being hurt, people are being run over by cars because they're so disconnected because of these phones."" A suspect has been arrested for the killing and pleaded not guilty, authorities said. But the phenomenon of witnesses being distracted by technology may continue, Gascon said. ""Just for our own safety, wouldn't you want to know if somebody standing next to you is pulling a gun out? I think I would,"" Gascon said. The security footage of the incident is chilling. The man, donning a baseball hat and smile, lifts a .45-caliber handgun in plain view, three or four times. He waves the weapon as if choosing who he wants to kill. At one point, he even wipes his nose with the gun. But nobody seemed to notice until the blast goes off. Though this is an extreme and violent example, there are others. You may remember the woman who was so absorbed with texting that she fell right into a mall fountain. Or you remember the guy who was so engrossed in his phone he almost walks right into a black bear. But those were just harmless viral videos that many have laughed at. This is different, especially for San Francisco State University students. ""That's just people's stupidity, I guess, ignorance of what's happening around them,"" said Whitney Bulmer. And there is no sign that this will end. The other day at the same train stop where Valdez boarded for the last time, a group of college students milled around, most of them too focused on their phones to notice a CNN camera focused on them.

"MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- The head of a small fishing community along the coast of Mumbai says he warned Indian police about terrorists smuggling powerful explosives months before gunmen entered through the harbor and launched a deadly siege against the city. Angry demonstrators in Mumbai shout anti-Pakistan slogans on Wednesday. Based on information from the lone surviving gunman, six bombs were placed around Mumbai by the 10 attackers as they surged through India's financial capital last week, killing 179 and wounding hundred more. Two exploded in taxis in separate parts of the city during the attacks. After the siege ended, authorities found one bomb at the Oberoi hotel and two at the Taj Mahal -- the two luxury hotels where gunmen took hostages. On Wednesday, officials found another bomb at a train station but the timer device on the explosive was not active, said railway official K.P. Raghuvanshi. According to Indian officials, the attackers hijacked a trawler in the Pakistani port city of Karachi -- about 575 miles (925 km) north of Mumbai -- and came ashore at Mumbai in dinghies. The fisherman, Damoda Tandel, showed CNN a letter in which he warned Indian authorities about a tip that terrorists were using the harbor to import RDX, an explosive compound commonly used in military and industrial applications. He says police did nothing. Police say the information Tandel gave was too vague to act upon. Now, Tandel is angry and afraid, worried there could be more explosives planted around Mumbai -- though authorities say they believe all the bombs have been found. Still, the fisherman says the police could have prevented the gunmen from coming ashore by securing the harbor. Under pressure to explain the lapse of security that allowed the siege to occur, India has made clear that it believes the coordinated attacks in Mumbai originated in Pakistan. A police official leading the investigation says the attackers spent the past three months in Pakistan carefully planning their strike on India's financial capital. Mumbai Joint Police Commissioner of Crime Rakesh Maria said the information comes from his interview with the suspect in custody, who police say is the lone surviving attacker. Maria identified the suspect as Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, 21, from Faridkot village in the Okara district of Pakistan's Punjab province. He is the son of Mohammed Amir Kasab, the police commissioner said. Multiple law enforcement and intelligence sources familiar with the investigation said Kasab was put through a polygraph test and has also been interviewed by the FBI. Maria said all 10 attackers were Pakistanis, which Pakistani officials have denied, blaming instead ""stateless actors."" The band of gunmen attacked 10 targets in Mumbai on Wednesday night, sparking three days of battles with police and troops in the heart of the city that is the hub of India's financial and entertainment industries. Most of the deaths occurred at the city's top two hotels, The Oberoi and the Taj Mahal. Maria said Kasab spend the past 18 months training at various camps run by Lashkar-e-Tayyiba -- a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda. Kasab told police he joined the group, known by its acronym LeT, six months before he began training. Pakistan banned LeT in 2002, after an attack on the Indian parliament that brought the nuclear rivals to the brink of war. The training primarily took place in the Kashmiri city of Muzaffarabad, Maria said. ""He was told things like, 'You'll come in through this door, then go over here, then go out through that door,'"" Maria told CNN. ""Very, very detailed explicit instructions. The gunmen were hand-picked, but there were no examinations per se."" All of the attackers were trained in Kashmir by former Pakistani army officers, but they apparently did not know each other. ""While in the camps they all had code names,"" Maria said.  Watch claims attackers came from Pakistan Â» . Kasab was trained to handle small arms as well as automatic weapons, the police commissioner said. He also received ""explosives training, survival training, (and) nautical training."" During the last three months of the training, which focused on the Mumbai strike, Kasab was ""shown photographs of the locations he was to target,"" including one of the city's main railway stations and a hospital. Police have identified Kasab as the clean-shaven young man photographed in a black T-shirt carrying an assault rifle during the attack on Mumbai's Victoria Terminus train station, also known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST). Maria said Kasab joined LeT because he was poor, but he expressed surprise at how easily he was ""brainwashed"" into joining the terror group. LeT has denied any role in the attack. The only claim of responsibility has been in an e-mail -- which Indian police say originated in Pakistan -- from a previously unknown group calling itself the Deccan Mujahedeen. Maria said he thinks LeT used the name Deccan Mujahedeen because it operates illegally in Pakistan. He described the 21-year-old suspect as someone who would go unnoticed, with a criminal record in Pakistan for only petty theft. But he said Kasab is a cold-blooded killer. Kasab told police investigators that he shot a small boy and, because he was crying, ""He shot him again, and killed him, to shut him up,"" Maria said. Kasab told the Indian investigators that the mission to strike Mumbai began on November 23 -- the Sunday before the attack -- when the attackers loaded a boat with their weapons, ammunition, and fake Indian identification documents, Maria said. A few days later, they hijacked a Pakistani fishing vessel near Indian international waters, and used that vessel to cover most of the approximately 500 nautical miles from Lahore, Pakistan, to Mumbai, he said. This account was confirmed by Mumbai's police chief in a news conference on Tuesday, who also cited the suspect's police interview. Maria said, according to Kasab's account, that the 10 attackers killed the captain and the crew, left them on the boat, and headed ashore in inflatable dinghies on Wednesday, the day of the attack. Asked if Kasab's testimony could be trusted, Maria said the suspect's description of the captain's body and the location of the attackers' satellite phone and global-positioning system matched what investigators found on the boat. ""The dead captain lay in the front of the boat face down with his throat cut hands tied behind his back,"" Maria said. He also noted that the weapons used in the attack can be traced back to Pakistan. Maria said none of the attackers were carrying their identification documents because they did not expect to return home.  Watch survivor recount Mumbai horror Â» . The police commissioner said the operation, as described by Kasab, was unique in its planning and execution -- not just in India, but worldwide. He said he expects Kasab to provide more details in his ongoing interrogation by Indian police, who have 90 days to charge him. They intend to charge Kasab with terrorism and seek the death penalty, which in India is carried out by hanging. They expect the whole process to take a year to 18 months. Maria said Kasab was not being tortured for answers.","NEW: Fisherman, Damoda Tandel, sent tip to authorities in a letter .

"(CNN) -- When the apocalypse comes, I'm pretty sure I can get by for a while on Diet Coke and Klondike Bars. Pants won't be necessary. But if we're talking about real long-term survival, no matter what horrible hell eventually strikes down upon us -- be it zombies or fire from the skies -- I'm pretty much a sitting duck. My little craftsman-style bungalow isn't exactly a fortress. Conversely, this week the Internet started buzzing about what appears to be the ultimate doomsday bunker that recently went up for sale in Las Vegas for $1.75 million. Of course, the bunker comes along with a proper above-ground house. But the real draw is the amazing subterranean hideaway that's 26 feet below. A wealthy entrepreneur names Jerry Henderson built the compound back in 1978 -- right during the middle of the Cold War. Fearing that the Soviets might drop some sort of Earth-flattening nuke (or maybe just a really aggressive bear on a unicycle) Henderson created his grand survival plan with all the must-have comforts of home. Well, almost. There doesn't appear to be a giant ball-pit filled with hamsters. Don't judge. You have your comforts. I have mine. That said, it pretty much has everything else you'd want if you were to live beneath the dirt. And it's not just a tiny space to move and breathe -- we're talking 15,000 square feet of basement with a pool, two Jacuzzis, a sauna, and a four-hole putting green. It's all decorated to feel like you're in a real house or in a real backyard. Hell, it even has a dance floor. ""Everyone we know is dead. Let's Dougie!"" The actual living space within the basement is a complete two-bedroom house with exterior walls and a front a door. It kind of looks like it came from The Brady Bunch, and measures 5,000 square feet. Which is huge! And not just for a doomsday bunker. For the sake of comparison, my entire home in Atlanta is only 1,500 square feet. And it's not nearly as pimped out as Henderson's bunker. What can I say? The paper vase filled with multi-colored sticks from IKEA seemed wild and exciting at the time. Meanwhile, at the '70s-retro bunker in Vegas, one can relax around the fake property amidst murals of nature, just as if you were actually outside. And to enhance the mood, you can adjust the lights and ceiling stars to simulate different times of day. The switches are labeled for sunset, day, dusk and night. The most advanced switch in my house turns on the garbage disposal. Over the years, the home-and-bunker combo at 3970 Spencer Street has gone through different owners since Jerry Henderson first built it. The most recent occupant bought the property back in 2005 for $2 million. However, last summer Seaway Bank and Trust Co. foreclosed on the home, and now they're trying to sell it off -- presumably to someone who seeks safety at the end of the world, but doesn't mind living in what, otherwise, seems like a rather drab part of town. Also known as metro Las Vegas. Mind you, there's nothing overly horrible about the location -- it's conveniently close to downtown if you need it -- but a little stroll around the block using Google street view reveals that the neighborhood is kind of boring, and the house actually faces an ugly office building and a bunch of power lines. On the plus side, I did locate a 7-Eleven less than a mile away. And, in a pinch, those delicious spinning meat tubes at the counter should be able to withstand the apocalypse for at least a decade or two. ""Son, distract the zombies. I'm sending your mother out for more taquitos."" Though I'm sure he didn't consider proximity to convenience stores, Henderson was, nevertheless, a big believer in underground living in general. Before his Vegas compound, he lived in a similar-style home in the '60s near Boulder, Colorado. Eventually, he even co-founded Underground World Home Corporation to build these subterranean dwellings for others, and he presented the idea at the 1964 World's Fair in New York with the slogan: How would you like sunshine every day... when you want it? Of course, we all do. That's why we have Prozac and whiskey. But if you fear the end of days and want to enjoy your final hours in a weird underground time capsule from the '70s, all this can be yours. Or you can just hunker down with me. You'll love my garbage disposal. Follow Jarrett Bellini on Twitter.","The 70's-style Las Vegas doomsday bunker was built during the height of the Cold War .

"Washington (CNN) -- In direct and emotional terms, President Barack Obama informed the nation and the world Sunday night that a U.S. operation in Pakistan earlier in the day killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden almost 10 years after terrorist attacks that killed thousands. ""I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women and children,"" the president said, looking directly into the television camera in the East Room of the White House for the statement broadcast nationwide on short notice. It was a triumphant moment for Obama and U.S. security forces, particularly an intelligence community that has been maligned for its failure to head off the 2001 attacks and subsequent breakdowns in cohesion. ""On nights like this one, we can say to those families who lost loved ones to al Qaeda's terror: justice has been done,"" Obama declared. He called bin Laden a mass murderer and said that ""his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and dignity."" As he spoke, top officials including Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, CIA Director Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen looked on in the East Room. ""For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaeda's leader and symbol and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies,"" Obama said. ""The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al Qaeda."" The president described the intelligence process that culminated in acquiring actionable information on bin Laden's whereabouts in recent months. ""Last August, after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community, I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden,"" Obama said. ""It was far from certain. And it took many months to run this thread to ground. I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we could locate bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside Pakistan."" According to senior administration officials, Obama chaired five National Security Council meetings in recent months, with the two most recent ones on April 19 and April 28, before giving the order Friday -- a day he spent in Alabama visiting storm-damaged areas of the state -- to proceed with the mission. Last week, Obama said, ""I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice."" ""Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan,"" the president continued. ""A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight they killed Osama Bin Laden and took custody of his body."" Senior administration officials told reporters on condition of not being identified that the surgical strike involved a helicopter raid on the heavily secured compound that lasted less than 40 minutes. The U.S. forces engaged in a firefight with bin Laden and others that killed five people -- bin Laden, three male accomplices and a woman whom one of the male combatants used as a human shield, the officials said. One U.S. helicopter crashed due to a mechanical problem and was destroyed, the officials added. In his remarks, Obama recounted the 2001 terrorist attacks, referring to the clear blue skies that day and the horror of planes slamming into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. He also spoke of families who lost loved ones that day, the intelligence community that finally tracked bin Laden down, and ""the men who carried out this operation."" ""It was nearly 10 years ago that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history,"" Obama said. ""The images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory -- hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky; the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground; black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon; the wreckage of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction."" He went on to describe the worst images -- ""those that were unseen to the world."" ""The empty seat at the dinner table. Children who were forced to grow up without their mother or their father. Parents who would never know the feeling of their child's embrace. Nearly 3,000 citizens taken from us, leaving a gaping hole in our hearts,"" Obama said. ""Tonight we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who have worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome,"" Obama said. ""The American people do not see their work nor know their names, but tonight they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice."" Thanking the U.S. forces in Sunday's operation, Obama said they ""exemplify the professionalism, patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country. And they are part of a generation that has borne the heaviest share of burden since that September day."" ""Let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11, that we have never forgotten your loss, nor wavered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores,"" he said. ""And tonight, let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11. I know that it has, at times, frayed. Yet today's achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people."" Obama also repeated the longstanding U.S. contention that originated with former President George W. Bush after the 2001 attacks that the fight against al Qaeada was not a war against Islam. ""I've made clear, just as President Bush did shortly after 9/11, that our war is not against Islam,"" Obama said. ""Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader. He was a mass murderer of Muslims. Indeed, al Qaeda slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries including our own.""","President Obama tells the nation that a U.S. operation killed Osama bin Laden .

"(CNN) -- It inspired childlike moments of wonder. It was a feeling that many had not felt since NASA's final space shuttle launch, Atlantis in July 2011. That's how the fans and followers around the Web described the weekend's events to NASA's social media team. And while social media users are often portrayed as having short attention spans, the @MarsCuriosity Twitter account continues to receive about 1,000 new followers an hour since landing on the red planet early Monday morning. The Facebook page imploded from 30,000 to more than 200,000 fans. ""We were blown out of the water,"" Stephanie L. Smith, social media specialist at NASA, said about the response NASA and the Jet Propulsion Lab's social team received on platforms including Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram and Google+. Opinion: Why I love Mars . The social media strategy was something that was considered years before the landing. NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory social media manager Veronica McGregor's first mission with Mars was in 2008 when the Phoenix rover landed. McGregor began making plans for Curiosity's big day back then. @MarsPhoenix was the fifth most followed Twitter account in 2008, she said. That account still has more than 200,000 followers. ""We knew there was a big audience out there on Twitter,"" McGregor said. The Saturday before the landing, @MarsCuriosity had 150,000 followers. It now has more than 818,000 and is growing at a rate of approximately 1,000 per hour, McGregor estimates. She and two team members, Courtney O'Connor and Smith, shape the voices behind many of NASA's social media accounts including @NASAJPL @MarsCuriosity and @asteroidwatch. Although exact numbers aren't yet available they were astounded when they discovered their official ""landing tweet"" at 1:32 a.m. EST on August 6 was retweeted 70,000 times around the world. A search of links, tweets and images including ""Mars"" from Saturday to Tuesday surpassed 700,000. McGregor and her team said they believe interest in space has always been high. Social media simply allowed the community to find each other, McGregor says. Mars rover captures nearby rocket 'footprint' CNN commenters also responded enthusiastically, sharing the Mars landing article to social media more than 26,000 times and leaving more than 4,900 comments. A CNN.com commenter known as Explore wrote, ""At the very core of me is a desire to seek the unknown, a desire to look beyond the confines of this tiny little spec in the universe to the vastness that lies beyond. This is inherent to every one of us even though we may sometimes deny it because we can only see the here and now."" And then there were the unexpected Internet wins that the NASA social media team never expected to happen. Bobak Ferdowsi, a NASA engineer and flight director of the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity mission, was quickly dubbed the ""NASA Mohawk Guy"" by Twitter users who followed his updates at @TweetsOutLoud. Internet memes showing a side view of Ferdowsi's mohawk with captions including, ""Becomes an Internet sensation. Too busy landing a robot on Mars to notice,"" Tumblrs about Bobak and blog posts exploded across the Web. He received several marriage proposals via Twitter but probably hasn't seen them. McGregor says Ferdowsi has been on Twitter ""a while"" but his account went from several hundred followers on Saturday to more than 30,000 Tuesday. As Curiosity landed Ferdowski tweeted, ""So incredible to be a part of this team and all that we've accomplished. Impossible not to be an emotional wreck."" A Curiosity rover ""Call Me Maybe"" mashup video surfaced on YouTube. Caley Burke, an aerospace engineer with the Kennedy Space Center created the video after being inspired by the U.S. Olympic swim team's version. 5 reasons to be excited about Curiosity . After closely listening to the lyrics for the first time Burke said it made perfect sense. ""I knew we were only going to get the call if the rover actually landed,"" she said. YouTube analytics show the video has been viewed 27,000 times, mostly by males between the ages of 45 and 54. There were viewing parties and thousands crowded into Times Square in New York City to watch the event unfold, snapping photos and sharing them with McGregor and her team. It was an event that, judging by social media updates, connected science-loving strangers, restored people's hope in space exploration and elicited a sense of awe. Since 2010 NASA has ranked at the top of public sector organizations in effectiveness of social media sites by experts from L2, a think tank for digital innovation. NASA hosted social media followers at seven field centers around the nation on August 3 and live streamed the event online. Participants were also given the opportunity to be present when the first signal of the landing was detected by mission control. Strategy aside, for some it was simply a moment in time to reflect on the amazing accomplishments of their fellow humans and science. No matter how they arrived, they walked away with much more than just Curiosity. To see more tweets and photos click here.

"(CNN) -- Cardiff University may be struck by lightning every day, but it's nothing to do with the miserable British weather. Deep within the Welsh university's department of engineering is a state-of-the-art ""lightning-lab"" where bolts of electricity are shot onto aircraft components. The idea is to recreate the conditions present when lightning strikes a plane at 35,000 feet, testing the fortitude of composite materials and conductor strips found on modern planes. ""There is a lightning strike every second around the world (and) every single aircraft is hit by lightning once a year,"" said Professor Manu Hadad of Cardiff University's Institute of Energy. Displaying the charred remains of two recently zapped plane panels, Hadad explains that a thin layer of copper mesh on an aircraft's exterior can drastically reduce the damage caused when lightning strikes. With support from the government and aerospace manufacturer, EADS, the ultimate aim of the $2 million project is to further refine and increase the working knowledge of how aircraft cope with these elements at altitude. Explore more: How airports beat bad weather . But while of particular interest to the electrical storm specialists at Cardiff University, lightning is just one of the many extreme weather phenomena encountered by planes when in the air. The build up of ice and strong winds in particular can also be issues and a host of academic institutions are applying hi-tech techniques to study the impact these conditions can have. Watch this: Superjumbo visits in tiny French village . At Cranfield University just outside London a team of engineers specialize in analyzing the formation of ice around engines and on aeroplane wings. Here, sub-zero temperatures are created and tests carried out in a specially designed ""icing-tunnel"" with the aim of understanding ice and its aerodynamic qualities. According to Dr David Hammond of Cranfield's School of Engineering, a large build up of ice can alter the shape and performance of vital aircraft components. Pointing to a freshly tested model wing, Hammond explains how ""the ice that forms (during flight)... can have a big spike that reverses the curvature of the leading (wing) edge and creates unsteadiness."" ""In an aircraft we work out which parts are most critical and make sure they're protected one way or another,"" he added. Researchers at Cranfield are currently investigating how a wire mesh can act as an effective method of preventing ice build up near fuel tanks. But Hammond is hopeful that other discoveries on how planes react to extreme weather will arise during the process of the group's studies. ""We're really trying to support the people who design and test aircraft,"" Hammond said. ""There's always a little bit of efficiencies that we can build in or maybe we can design slightly more efficiently to get performance for the passengers and for the environment.""","Extreme weather conditions can alter the performance of planes in flight .

"Schertz, Texas (CNN) -- Two moments have changed Eddie Canales' life. Both occurred on the football field. The first happened nearly a decade ago. It was November 2, 2001, and Canales was watching his son's football game in San Marcos, Texas. Chris Canales, a high school senior, had three offers to play college football, and that night, he was having the game of his life. With four minutes left in the fourth quarter, he made a touchdown-saving tackle. But something went wrong. ""I could hear my teammates saying, 'Chris, come on, let's go,' "" Chris, now 26, remembered. ""And I couldn't move."" At the hospital, doctors told Eddie and his wife that their son had suffered a spinal cord injury. If Chris survived, he'd probably never be able to move anything below his shoulders. Chris nearly died twice during those early days. But his condition stabilized, and Eddie quit his job to become his full-time caregiver. The family adjusted to their new circumstances, but Eddie, 55, said it wasn't easy. ""You don't want to even think that your son may never walk again,"" he said. ""That was a hard pill to swallow."" Near the first anniversary of his injury, Chris was struggling with depression. To cheer him up, Eddie invited him out to do something he'd always enjoyed -- watching high school football. It was the first time Chris had been out to watch a game since his injury. But that afternoon, as they watched from the stands, the unthinkable happened: A player went down and lay immobilized on the field. Eddie and Chris knew immediately that it was a spinal cord injury. ""Chris turned to me and said, 'Dad, we've got to go help him,' "" Eddie recalled. In that moment, Eddie's life changed again: He found his mission. He and Chris visited the injured player and his family in the hospital, and within months, Gridiron Heroes -- a nonprofit that helps athletes who've suffered spinal cord injuries while playing high school football -- was born. It's a fraternity that now includes 19 injured players in Texas. Many spinal injury organizations raise money for medical research. But from the start, Eddie wanted to provide emotional support to injured athletes and their families. Whenever a new player joins the group, he and Chris drive to visit them no matter where they live in the state. Eddie helps the families face myriad emotional, financial and practical issues, while Chris encourages and mentors the athletes. ""We try to provide information, inspiration and hope,"" Eddie said. ""We want to make sure they don't feel alone."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . The National Center for Catastrophic Injury Research reports that 79 high school football players suffered spinal cord injuries in the United States between 2000 and 2009. While these injuries occur at all levels of the game, Eddie says that high school athletes are much more likely to suffer extreme financial hardship. ""Someone injured on a professional level is going to be taken care of,"" he said. ""But on a high school level, it's a totally different story."" In the first year alone, these injuries can cost from $240,000 to well over $800,000, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center. When schools or school districts don't have a catastrophic injury policy -- as was the case with Chris Canales and Nat Little, another Gridiron Hero -- injured athletes can receive as little as $10,000 to cover expenses. Eddie says that even when schools and families do have insurance, the deductibles and out-of-pocket costs can be crushing to a family. While Gridiron Heroes wasn't started to give families financial support, Eddie devotes a lot of time to this issue. He helps families organize their own fundraising efforts, and Gridiron Heroes often pitches in when there's a specific need. The group has helped buy wheelchairs and wheelchair-accessible vehicles, and it has also helped remodel homes, installing wheelchair ramps and wheelchair-accessible bathrooms. Every month, Eddie also sends each family a $100 Walmart gift card to help buy necessary supplies. Eddie and Chris work on the prevention side, too. They drive more than 1,000 miles every month to meet with football coaches and trainers at conferences around the country. Their goal is to raise awareness about their work and encourage coaches to teach proper hitting technique, which reduces the chances of head and spinal cord injuries. Gridiron Heroes is a father-son partnership -- a labor of love for Chris and Eddie, neither of whom receive compensation for their efforts. While Chris is deeply committed to their mission, he's quick to acknowledge that Eddie does the lion's share of the work. ""We get calls nationwide ... all hours of the night and day, and he won't turn anybody down,"" Chris said. ""Behind the scenes, he gets everything done."" The elder Canales gets it done from his easy chair in the living room, via his cell phone and laptop. It's a location that not only allows him to be within earshot of Chris, who still depends on him for care, but makes it easy for him to keep up with the latest scores on his big-screen TV. The rest of the Gridiron Heroes share Canales' passion for sports, so get-togethers often involve a game of some kind. The activity of choice? Going to a football game. ""I get the question a lot: 'How can you still support the game of football?' "" Eddie said. ""Well, that game is what brings them together."" His son agrees. ""We're a band of brothers,"" he said. ""Our biggest bond is football."" Web extra: Crippling injuries don't dim players' love of football . Eddie stresses that he isn't trying to deter anyone from playing football. In fact, the father and son believe that the discipline and can-do attitude instilled in Chris by his coaches helped him to recover and even regain some movement in his arms. ""We still love the game of football,"" Eddie said. ""But we need to do a better job to help these young men when this does happen. ... We want to make sure these kids are not forgotten."" Word about Gridiron Heroes has spread around the country in the last couple of years, and more than 40 families from outside Texas have reached out to Eddie. Someday, he hopes to set up a national network, with branches to help the injured players in each state. He also wants to establish a fund in Texas to support high school players who suffer severe injuries. Until then, he will continue his personal crusade to support these athletes and their families. Helping these young men -- whom he calls his heroes -- has become his life's work. ""They've never quit. They've never given up,"" he says. ""That's what keeps me pushing."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- You know how good it feels when you fish a $10 bill out of your jeans pocket right before it hits the wash. Imagine coming into hundreds of dollars from a savings bond or a bank account you forgot about. Could there be a pile of money waiting for you to find it? You may get a letter from a company saying you have unclaimed money or property, and for a fee, you'll be able to reclaim it. But before you pay for this service, remember there are plenty of free Web sites that will help reunite you with your treasures. There's almost $33 billion in unclaimed money from old payroll checks, utility refunds, trust distributions, stocks, banking or checking accounts, certificates of deposit and the contents of safe deposit boxes, according to estimates by the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators. Property is considered abandoned if there has been no activity on it for more than three years, according to Steve Larson of NAUPA. Such money is turned over to the state of your last known address, and the state holds the money in its coffers until you or your heirs claim it. There is no time limit to claim most abandoned property. In fact, years from now, your great-great grandchildren could claim it. To find your hidden money, go to http://www.missingmoney.com/, an official database for the NAUPA that has records from most state unclaimed property programs. You can also link to your individual state unclaimed property program. If you come across records that indicate there may be money left in an old bank account, find out if the bank is still in business. For that, go to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Web site at www.fdic.gov. Look under ""Bank Find,"" and you'll be able to see the history of the bank, including any mergers. But if your bank failed, and you don't claim those funds within a year and a half, the money in your account is turned over to the FDIC. To search for the failed bank, go to www2.fdic.gov/funds/index.asp. If you don't claim the money after a few years, you'll lose what's in your account, says David Barr of the FDIC. ""There's quite a bit of unclaimed property out there,"" he says. Savings bonds . Anything you're supposed to keep for 30 years is bound to slip your mind. In fact, there are more than $15 billion worth of savings bonds that have stopped earning interest but haven't been claimed, according to the Treasury Department. If you have savings bonds that are still earning interest, but you have no idea where the documents are or how much they're worth, get in touch with the record-keeping office of the U.S. Treasury Department. As long as you have enough information -- like when the bonds were issued or the Social Security number on the bond -- the Treasury Department will replace or reissue your bond. If you stumble across savings bonds that have stopped earning interest, or you think you may have had a bond or two as a kid, go to treasurydirect.gov/indiv/indiv.htm and look under ""Treasury Hunt."" This search mechanism will tell you if there are any bonds in your name. If there are unclaimed bonds, a member of the Treasury Department can contact you. There is no statute of limitations on claiming savings bonds. No matter how old they are, the money stays there for you or your heirs to claim, and the Treasury Department must respond to a claim. ""We want to get those off our books,"" says Steve Meyerhardt of the Treasury Department. ""It doesn't do us any good to be hanging on to the funds."" Pensions . Pensions may be going the way of the dinosaur, but there's still plenty of cash left from people who forgot to claim them. There's about $133 million in unclaimed pension funds, says Gary Pastorius of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal pension insurance program. About 32,000 people may have pension money just sitting around. The PBGC takes over pension plans if a company goes out of business. If the employer can't locate people that have left the company, the PBGC tries to track them down. If you think you may have left a pension plan somewhere, you can check with the PBGC at search.pbgc.gov/mp/. There, you can type in your name and company in a search tool. Finding unexpected cash isn't hard as long as you know where to look. If an asset locator contacts you about unclaimed property, take the time to use the search tools. Asset locators generally charge a 10 to 20 percent fee to find your unclaimed funds. While this can be a legitimate service, you're being asked to pay for something you can do for free. ""These asset finders are providing something of value,"" says Joe Ridout of Consumer Action, a nonprofit consumer watchdog group. ""But you can do it yourself with a few mouse clicks.""

"(CNN) -- A construction accident at the site of the Brazilian stadium that will host the opening match of the World Cup killed two workers, Sao Paulo fire officials said Wednesday. Officials initially said there were three victims, but the fire department amended the death toll on its Twitter account. The Arena Corinthians is one of the venues that will host World Cup matches in 2014. A crane was hoisting a part of the metal roof when it collapsed, causing the piece to fall, partially damaging the building, according to a statement released by the construction company, Odebrecht Infrastructure. It was a procedure that had been carried out many times at the construction site without incident, including the installation a week ago of a piece of roof of the same proportions, the company said. The stadium is to be the home of Sport Club Corinthians Paulista. The club's directors issued a statement expressing sadness over the incident. The construction company identified the victims as Fabio Luiz Pereira, 42, and Ronaldo Oliveira dos Santos, 44. The accident comes as Brazil faces an approaching deadline to finish construction on its World Cup stadiums. Earlier this year, FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke declared that all stadiums would have to be ready by December. The tournament is to be held from June 12 to July 13. In August, Brazil's sports minister, Aldo Rebelo, relayed concerns over delays at five of the stadiums being built. It was unknown how much Wednesday's incident would affect the construction of the Arena Corinthians. The state-run Agencia Brasil news agency reported that about a third of the stadium will be closed off as officials investigate the accident. Workers were excused for several days of mourning. ""We are less concerned with timelines,"" Andres Sanchez, the former president of Corinthians, told reporters, according to Agencia Brasil. ""We are concerned about satisfying you and attending to the victims' families."" Brazil suffered a setback last month when a judge ordered the suspension of construction at another host venue due to safety concerns. The judge stopped work at the Arena de Baixada, in the city of Curitiba, over concerns that workers were in danger of ""being buried, run over, falling from heights and being hit by material, among other serious risks."" Preparations for the World Cup have been controversial in Brazil. Protesters are outraged at what they consider lavish spending on the World Cup as well as the 2016 Olympic Games. They have also been critical of the lack of investment in public services, schools, hospitals and transportation. That led thousands to march earlier this year on the streets across the country. CNN's Shasta Darlington, Miguel Castro, James Masters and John Sinnott contributed to this report.","NEW: State media: 30% of the stadium will be closed off as authorities investigate .

"(CNN) -- Sergio Garcia, a 36-year-old undocumented immigrant in California, has held two lifelong dreams: to become a U.S. citizen and to practice law. He's been waiting 19 years for a visa still stuck in a backlog, but the California Supreme Court ensured this week that his second dream will become a reality. Garcia can be admitted to California's state bar and legally practice as a lawyer there, the court ruled. ""I'm super excited to finally be able to fulfill one of my dreams,"" Garcia told CNN Friday. Court: Undocumented immigrant can be lawyer . But the case raises many questions, particularly among those who have been critical of Garcia's efforts to practice law. They question how someone who is in the country without legal status can be licensed to uphold the law as an attorney. Garcia says that this an easy initial response to make but that looking at the details of his case, it is not so clear-cut. He was brought to the United States as a minor and has been in line for 19 years for a green card. If anyone feels frustrated the the situation, they should address it with the federal government, Garcia said. It's the immigration system that's broken, he said. Garcia was born in Mexico in 1977 and taken to California by his parents when he was 17 months old, according to court documents. He remained there until 1986, when he and his parents returned to Mexico. Eight years later, at age 17, Garcia again returned to California with his parents and without documentation, though his father had obtained permanent resident status in the United States. That year, Garcia's father filed an immigration visa petition on his son's behalf, which federal immigration officials accepted in 1995. The visa still has not been granted, even though Garcia has lived in the state since 1994. California's Supreme Court ruled Thursday (PDF) that no state law or public policy should stop Garcia or others like him from obtaining a law license in the state. Asked why he didn't choose a different career or pursue other opportunities, Garcia said law was his singular focus. ""I wasn't smart and put all my eggs into one basket,"" he said. ""This whole idea of being an attorney was the only idea I had going, so 20 years of working on that dream, I couldn't really afford to give up on it."" ""That, and I'm a little bit stubborn, anyway,"" Garcia added. Now that he has a law license, however, one thing that Garcia will not specialize in is immigration law. ""Oh, no, that's just too messed up,"" he said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","A California court rules that Sergio Garcia can practice law .

"(CNN) -- Those trying to reinstitute Proposition 8 -- the voter-backed referendum to ban gay marriage in California -- lost once again in court on Wednesday, meaning no stop to such legal unions that resumed a few weeks ago. In two brief rulings, California Supreme Court Chief Justice Tani Gorre Cantil-Sakauye dismissed attempts by opponents of same-sex marriage. One was brought by ProtectMarriage.com, the group that's led legal efforts defending what's known as Prop 8, and the other came from a San Diego County clerk who'd argued the state had put him in an ""untenable position"" by compelling him to sign off on marriage licenses for gay and lesbian couples. The rulings were the latest in a spate of decisions -- at the state and federal level, including the U.S. Supreme Court -- that have gone against those trying to restrict marriage in the Golden State to between one man and one woman. Attorney General Kamala Harris was among those gay marriage supporters who cheered Wednesday's ruling, much as they have the others in recent months. She tweeted: ""The CA Supreme court has denied the #Prop8 proponents' request to halt same-sex marriages!"" ""#Prop8 dead for good,"" tweeted Equality California, the state's biggest gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender advocacy group. ""CA Supr. Ct. refuses last remaining legal challenge. Freedom to marry here to stay."" Those on the other side of the debate, meanwhile, lamented Wednesday's ruling and more generally criticized state leaders who, in their view, had ""silenced more than 7 million Californians who clearly expressed their views."" Case challenges Pennsylvania's ban on same-sex marriage . ""Though the current California officials are unwilling to support the state constitution, we remain hopeful that one day Californians will elect officials who will,"" Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal advocacy organization, said in a statement. ""...The court's decision today ... does not end the debate about marriage in California."" In May 2008, California's Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage, ruling that the state's constitution gives ""this basic civil right to (marry to) all Californians, whether gay or heterosexual, and to same-sex couples as well as to opposite-sex couples."" The tide turned a few months later, when 52% of voters backed Proposition 8 to halt gay and lesbian marriages. Yet state officials declined to stand behind the prohibition, even if private parties did. A federal appeals court subsequently ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, though it still issued a stay on same-sex marriages until the U.S. Supreme Court could weigh in. That happened June 26, when the nation's high court -- in a 5-4 decision -- dismissed an appeal of the earlier lower court ruling on narrow, jurisdictional grounds. Midnight vows: Same-sex couples ring in new lives as law takes effect . Two days later, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals officially lifted the previous injunction, and same-sex weddings took place very soon thereafter. Proposition 8 backers tried to get the U.S. Supreme Court to again intervene, but Justice Anthony Kennedy refused to do so. Efforts continued, though, in the state court system. One came from San Diego County Clerk Ernest Dronenburg, who last month asked the California Supreme Court to order Gov. Jerry Brown, Harris and other state officials to abide by an ""immediate temporary stay"" to once again halt same-sex marriages. Dronenburg argued that he had been ""threatened with legal action by the attorney general for exercising his public duties consistent with state law defining marriage as the union between one man and one woman."" Yet the state Supreme Court responded days later by denying the county clerk's request to stop same-sex marriages immediately. On Wednesday, Cantil-Sakauye officially dismissed Dronenburg's petition.","NEW: Gay marriage foes lament the decision, say the debate in California isn't over .

"(CNN) -- The work in Washington state communities shattered by a landslide in late March has turned its focus from searching for missing bodies to a rebuilding operation, a spokeswoman for the Snohomish County Sheriff's Department said Monday. Forty-one people have been confirmed dead and identified. Two people remain missing, but ""essentially the active search has ended,"" Shari Ireton told CNN. A rain-saturated hillside along the Stillaguamish River gave way on the outskirts of the rural town of Oso on March 22. Search crews had been digging through deep mud and debris, which is 70 feet thick in some places, to search for the missing. ""We are looking at recovery and rebuilding,"" Ireton said, referring to clearing and repairing roads damaged or covered by the slide. Steven Hadaway and Kris Regelbrugge were never found. Frank Hadaway told CNN affiliate KCPQ that he has peace even though his brother's body may never be found. One resident, who found his sister's body in her car two weeks ago, said the search needs to continue. ""There's a lot of people that want to keep going,"" Dayn Brunner told KCPQ. ""And there's a lot of people that will even do it for free. We just want everybody out."" The search is not entirely over as some workers ""will still be monitoring for possible victim's remains,"" Ireton said.","It has been 38 days since a rain-saturated hillside in Washington gave way .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah is in the lead with four-fifths of the votes counted in Afghanistan's landmark presidential elections, the country's Independent Election Commission said Thursday. About 7 million Afghans voted on April 5 to choose a successor to outgoing President Hamid Karzai, in what will be the country's first democratic transfer of presidential power. With 82.6% of the votes counted, Abdullah, a former foreign minister, has 43.8% of the vote, Independent Election Commission chief Mohammad Yousuf Nooristani said at a news conference Thursday. Ashraf Ghani, with 32.9% of the vote, is in second place, he said, while Zalmai Rasoul is in third place with 11.1% of the vote. All the votes should be counted by Saturday, when the initial results will be announced, Nooristani said. The final results will then be declared on May 14. If no candidate has a majority, then a second round of voting will be held. Nooristani was not yet able to say whether the election would go to a runoff vote or not. Leading contenders . Abdullah and Ghani were seen as the front-runners going into the April 5 ballot. Abdullah, who is associated with the Tajik ethnic group, is partnered with Mohammad Mohaqeq, a leader of the Hazara ethnic group, and he also has a Pashtun on the ticket. An eye doctor by training, Abdullah became Afghanistan's foreign minister under Karzai. He ran against him in 2009 but dropped out to protest what he saw as large-scale voter fraud. He is considered to be relatively liberal and has made at least one public statement in support of women's rights. Ghani, who earned his doctorate at Columbia University in the U.S., is from the Pashtun ethnic group. His running mate is Abdul Rashid Dostum, a leader of the Uzbek ethnic group. Ghani was the country's finance minister under Karzai. Security issue . Security will be a key issue for whoever is elected president. A series of deadly attacks marked the run-up to the vote, and Kabul was again rocked by violence Thursday when at least three American medical workers in the capital were shot by a policeman guarding a hospital. NATO troops are scheduled to draw down from Afghanistan by the end of the year. Karzai, who is constitutionally required to step down, has refused to sign an agreement to keep international forces in Afghanistan, also known as the Status of Forces Agreement. But the two leading presidential candidates have said they would sign it.","Abdullah Abdullah is in the lead with 82% of the vote counted, Afghan electoral body says .

"(CNN) -- A fair number of impressive construction plans have been announced this year, from Norway's intention to create the world's first shipping tunnel to Maldives' plans for a space age underwater hotel to Dubai's plans for the world's biggest shopping mall. How do these announcements stack up against what's already out there? We've compiled 25 of what we think are some of the most impressive engineering/construction achievements to date, taking into consideration the era in which they were built and the knowledge and materials that were available to designers. Many were inspired by the human impulse to travel, and those that weren't can be enjoyed by travelers today. Engineering can, of course, also include electronics and other micro-feats -- arguably computers and smartphones are among the most successful, popular and influential pieces of engineering ever created -- but we're interested here in big, bold and brave.

"(CNN) -- The ""League of Nations"" might sound like the next Hollywood blockbuster, but UEFA's latest plan to revolutionize international football caused nothing but confusion when it was announced Thursday. The game's European governing body has stepped up its attempt to bring more prestige to friendly games, creating more opportunities for countries to qualify for the 2020 European Championship finals and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. But it has left journalists and fans bamboozled, with nobody seemingly able to explain just quite how the tournament will work -- even UEFA admits the format ""has not been finalized."" Instead, social media was awash with doubts and more questions than answers over the new system, which was given the go-ahead at the UEFA Congress in Astana, Kazakhstan. Set to commence in September 2018, the competition will involve all 54 member nations, with four divisions of 12-14 teams divided into four smaller pools. The top-ranked teams will be in the first division, and the lowest-ranked in the last. The winner of each mini-pool will then meet at a neutral venue in June 2019, and the overall division winner automatically qualifies for the Euro 2020 finals. It would mean that one of the weaker nations from Division D would be guaranteed a place at the tournament. The remaining 20 qualification places for Euro 2020 will be decided through the usual qualifying process, with games played from 2019, possibly going on as late as March 2020. There is the possibility that a team may reach the League of Nations playoff final having already made it through to either the World Cup or European Championship finals. In that case, the place would be allocated to the country finishing immediately below in that division. It is also thought that two of Europe's 13 qualifying places for the 2022 World Cup may also be decided via the top two divisions of the Nations League. While fans across the world wrestled with a potentially exciting concept bereft of any definite detail, UEFA recognized the new venture as a ""big step for national teams in Europe."" ""We accept and respect that all UEFA member associations have agreed to create a new competition,"" Wolfgang Niersbach, chairman of UEFA's national teams competition committee, said in a statement. ""This is a big step for national teams in Europe and we hope that fans will support the new format."" The idea has been warmly welcomed by some, including the English Football Association. ""The prospect of England playing three or four teams from the best 12 or 16 countries in Europe on a home and away basis should be very exciting,"" FA general secretary Alex Horne told his organization's website. ""It means we will go from a major tournament such as a World Cup straight into a set of three international double-headers between September and November that will really mean something. ""There will be the threat of relegation too, so there will really be something at stake."" The European Club Association, which represents the 214 teams from across the continent, believes the move is a positive one. ""A positive aspect of this new concept is that our players will no longer have to travel around the world for friendly matches,"" ECA Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. ""I am not worried about the Champions League; it is a prime product and the Europa League as well will continue to flourish."" But there are concerns from FIFPro, the world players' union, which believes the new format may place too much strain on players. Leading nations have often used friendly games to blood new talent, work on new tactics and give an opportunity to players to stake their claim for a regular starting place at major tournaments, with multiple substitutions taking place throughout contests. That may now change, according to FIFPro Director of Player Services Tijs Tummers. ""As we understand, the Nations League will be another prestigious competition,"" he told FIFPro's website. ""As a consequence, that implies an increase in the workload for the group of top players.""","UEFA has introduced the Nations League competition .

"(CNN) -- Sid Meier's ""Civilization"" is now 20 years old. But for someone who has been involved in video games since the mid-'80s, one of Meier's early prophesies is just now coming true because of mobile and social gaming technologies, he told CNN. ""I've always said that games will someday take over the world and that seems to be happening,"" he said. Meier is considered to be one of the great game designers. He serves as director of creative development for Firaxis Games. He sat down with CNN to reflect on the short history of video games and what he hopes will be their long future. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: Congratulations on 20 years of ""Civilization."" When you were first coming up with the idea, did you imagine that it would stand the test of time? Meier: I wanted to make a game that was fun to play. Where it is today, I wouldn't have dreamed. We made the first ""Civilization"" game because it was a game that we wanted to play and hoped that if we liked it, others would, too. Lucky for us, people latched on to the game and our fan community has made the game what it is now. CNN: Where do you find inspiration? Meier: The themes for all of my games are inspired by things I've been interested in my whole life: history, pirates, railroads, airplanes, golf, etc. are all things that I enjoy, so I wanted to make games based on these subjects. For ""Civilization"" games, we get a lot of our inspiration from our fans and the talented folks who work on the games. While I have my own ideas to contribute, by bringing in designers with a fresh perspective, we're able to continue growing and developing ""Civilization"" to create a new gameplay experience with each iteration of the game. I've also been inspired by other developers and games such as Will Wright's ""SimCity,"" the first ""God Game,"" which really set the stage for the first ""Civilization."" Also, Bruce Shelley, one of my design partners during Microprose's early days, created one of the best RTS games ever made, the ""Age of Empires"" series. I'm also a big fan of Dani Bunten who created the first open ended adventure game, ""The Seven Cities of Gold."" CNN: What is the greatest innovation or idea that has been introduced in the ""Civilization"" franchise? Meier: Each ""Civ"" game is unique because the designer brings their own unique ideas to the game. The biggest changes lately were the hexagonal world tiles, the one-unit-per-tile combat system and the beautiful graphics in ""Civ V."" We'd thought about hex tiles all the way back in the original ""Civ,"" but never tried it until ""Civ V."" The one-unit-per-tile system makes combat much more tactical and fun to play. And the graphics take the gameplay experience to a wonderful new place. Maybe the biggest change to the Civilization series as a whole is that we've managed to bring it to a variety of new audiences through our console, mobile and Facebook versions of the game. CNN: What were some of the best times and hardest times in gaming for you in the last 20 years? Meier: It's difficult to think of hard times when I get to go into work every day and make games. I have the greatest job in the world and feel very fortunate to have been doing this for so long. The thrill of designing a new game never seems to grow old for me. CNN: How has gaming and video games changed in the past two decades? Meier: Technology is always changing and giving us new tools to work with. PC and console game designers have been taking advantage of this by creating dramatically better graphics and deeper gameplay experiences. New technology has also allowed developers to deliver games on a wide array of devices, so people from all walks of life have access to games everywhere from phones to tablets to the Internet. It's a great time to be a gamer. CNN: Is the social gaming and mobile gaming trend a product of advancing technology leading an audience or a change in the gamer's philosophy about gaming? Meier: It's a little bit of the chicken and the egg debate, but I do think advancing technology has allowed us to explore new platforms and areas of games that we didn't previously have at our disposal. Social and mobile games deliver a different kind of experience than the traditional PC and console games, which seem to appeal to a broader audience than the usual gamer. The growth of gaming on so many different platforms, and the diversity of the audience is great news for the gaming industry as a whole. CNN: Has gaming become more important to our culture in terms of entertainment? Meier: Games have become the entertainment of choice for people all over the world. I've always said that games will someday take over the world and that seems to be happening. There are so many different gaming platforms and a constant stream of new games for players to enjoy in any way they choose. It's exciting to see the rise of games in popular culture in the past few years. Now it seems that everyone plays games on their phones and social networks.

"(CNN) -- Blastoff! A fresh crew took off for the International Space Station on Tuesday aboard a Russian rocket. Alexander Skvortsov and Oleg Artemyev -- of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) -- and Steve Swanson of NASA are riding inside the Soyuz TMA-12M spacecraft, NASA said in a statement. They launched at 5:17 p.m. ET from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, and were expected to dock some six hours later. But the spacecraft was not able to complete its third thruster burn, delaying the crew's arrival, NASA said. They are now scheduled to reach the space station on Thursday. Initial information suggests the spacecraft was not in the proper orientation for the burn. The three astronauts were reported to be in good condition. ""As is customary, Swanson, Skvortsov and Artemyev will have several days set aside to familiarize themselves with their new home in space. The new trio will also assist the veteran crewmates as they adjust to living and working in space for six months,"" NASA said in its statement. The three will join Koichi Wakata of Japan, Rick Mastracchio of the United States and Mikhail Tyurin of Russia, who are expected to return home in May. Skvortsov, Artemyev and Swanson are scheduled to return in September. Amid U.S.-Russian tensions over Ukraine, space show goes on .","NEW: Arrival delayed, now scheduled for Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Appetites already whet by Lance Armstrong's reported admission to Oprah Winfrey of performance-enhancing drug use, we now eagerly wait to see what else the disgraced cycling legend puts on the table with the talk show queen. The first part of their 2 1/2-hour interview airs on Winfrey's OWN cable network and the Internet Thursday at 9 p.m. ET. Whatever transpires, Armstrong's carefully constructed public persona has been altered forever. Livestrong: Come clean . The cancer charity Armstrong founded urged the fallen star to come clean, ahead of the interview airing. ""We expect Lance to be completely truthful and forthcoming in his interview and with all of us in the cancer community,"" Livestrong said in a statement released Wednesday. ""We expect we will have more to say at that time."" In October, Armstrong resigned as chairman of the charity he founded ""to spare the foundation any negative effects as a result of controversy surrounding my cycling career,"" according to a statement posted to the group's website at the time. A few weeks later, he left the board entirely amid concerns that his involvement was harming the charity. On Monday, he visited the charity and ""expressed his regret for the stress the team suffered in recent years as a result of the controversy surrounding his cycling career,"" the organization said in a statement. ""Inspired by the people with cancer whom we serve, we feel confident and optimistic about the Foundation's future and welcome an end to speculation,"" the group said. Livestrong tells Armstrong: Be truthful about doping . Postage due . As part of his public reclamation project, Armstrong might pay back part of the money he received from the U.S. Postal Service, which sponsored the cyclist and his team while he was winning six of his Tours de France, a source familiar with the situation said. The source said Armstrong was in negotiations to repay some of the money. ESPN reported in 2011 that the agency, which is not taxpayer funded, paid more that $31 million to sponsor the team during the final four years of its agreement. A spokeswoman for the postal service said: ""We are not in a position now to discuss any of the legal issues associated with these developments and the prior relationship between the U.S. Postal Service and Mr. Armstrong, but we will do so at an appropriate time."" Armstrong won the Tour de France a record seven straight years, beginning in 1999. The postal service sponsored the team from 1996 to 2004. Lance Armstrong in talks to return Postal Service money . Slipping from his pedestal . The court of public opinion came down decidedly against Armstrong this week after he acknowledged using performance-enhancing drugs after years of denials. ""This guy is a loser and a liar!!"" Melinda Morgan said on CNN's Facebook page. ""He is not sorry for what he did, he is sorry that he got caught!!"" Margaret Midkiff said there's no hope of Armstrong reviving his career. ""He's lied to folks way too long."" Cycling fan Beverlee Ring said she has ""mixed feelings"" about the Winfrey interview. ""He should apologize and do whatever it takes to begin the healing,"" she said in a submission to CNN's iReport. ""Now is when the real work begins for Lance."" But Gretta MichellÃ© said it's too late for redemption. ""He had the opportunity to be honest from the beginning and he should have,"" she posted on the Facebook page. ""Winning was more important."" Public takes shots at Armstrong . Sanctions still stick . Armstrong's reported admissions, if true, would be a stunning reversal after years of vigorous denials, including lawsuits filed against accusers. But it still will not be enough to reverse the lifetime ban and other sanctions that have kept him from participating in some triathlons, the three-event sport he took up after retiring from cycling. ""Only when Mr. Armstrong makes a full confession under oath, and tells the anti-doping authorities all he knows about doping activities, can any legal and proper process for him to seek any reopening or reconsideration of his lifetime ban commence,"" said David Howman, director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency. Oprah interview won't reduce sanctions against Armstrong, officials say . Critics find vindication . Those who spoke out against Armstrong at the height of his power and popularity, not only felt his wrath, but the wrath of an adoring public. Now, stripped of endorsement deals and his titles, those who did speak out are feeling vindicated. Former colleagues, assistants and journalists who ran afoul of the Armstrong machine, complained of being blackballed, ostracized and the object of lawsuits designed to shut them up. ""Eleven years of bullying and threats,"" Kathy LeMond, the wife of cyclist Greg LeMond -- one of Armstrong's earliest targets -- wrote on Twitter. ""LA is now the Greatest Fraud in the History of Sports."" Once a close friend of Armstrong, cyclist Frankie Andreu had a falling out with him after his wife, Betsy, began to cooperate with a reporter working on a book about doping allegations against Armstrong. She recently told Cycling News that ""grown men were torn to shreds by Armstrong,"" and said she was ""extremely grateful"" to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency for its investigation that resulted in a lifetime ban for Armstrong and loss of his seven Tour de France titles. 'What Joe Public thinks of me I don't care,"" Andreu told the New York Daily News. ""I care what my family and close friends think of me. When it affects my husband's ability to work then it's grossly unfair. Who knows how many jobs he lost because I refused to lie to protect Lance.""

"(CNN) -- Fifty years ago, Jay Ward's animated moose and squirrel duo, ""Rocky & Bullwinkle,"" debuted on ABC, forever changing the way the world looked at animated television. His daughter, Tiffany Ward, continues her father's legacy as executive producer of the feature films ""The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle, ""Dudley Do-Right"" and ""George of the Jungle,"" and Cartoon Network's (sister channel to CNN) new ""George of the Jungle"" animated TV series. ""My dad was a true eccentric,"" Ward said. ""His studio was a wonderland for me. It had a soda fountain, ice cream sundaes, a snow cone machine, a popcorn maker and candy bars everywhere."" Tiffany Ward grew up in Berkeley, California, and didn't move to Hollywood until 1959 at age 13 when her dad set up his television studio. ""Dad was always doing fun things,"" Ward said, recalling a 1961 Sunset Boulevard block party her father hosted to promote ""The Bullwinkle Show."" The show was originally named ""Rocky and his Friends,"" but was renamed ""The Bullwinkle Show"" when the program went from ABC to NBC. Ward was a one-man public relations machine, churning out first-rate promos in the days before PR companies were entrenched in the system. In another promotional stunt, Jay Ward tried to buy an island between Minnesota and Canada that he named Moosylvania (he leased it instead). In efforts to have Moosylvania made into the 51st state, Ward traveled cross-country by bus, collecting signatures along the way. When Ward reached the White House gates, he asked to speak to President John F. Kennedy about statehood for Moosylvania, but guards brusquely turned him away. As it turned out, Kennedy was dealing with the Cuban Missile Crisis on that exact day. Jay Ward did not have a favorite character, his daughter said, because to him it would have been like selecting a favorite child (Incidentally, Ward had three kids). Of all the characters he created, Ward didn't have a favorite per se, but Tiffany Ward does recall his partiality to Dudley Do-Right, the slow but well-meaning Canadian Mountie. When asked about ""Rocky & Bullwinkle's"" everlasting appeal, Ward said she thinks it struck such a chord and remains popular today because her father never wrote for children, he wrote for adults. Jay Ward wanted kids to enjoy the pictures while grown-ups laughed at the quick wit and inside jokes. In one episode, Rocky and Bullwinkle are propelled to the moon when their oven explodes while the pair are following Bullwinkle's grandmother's recipe for mooseberry fudge cake. Fun for kids for obvious reasons, but adults certainly got a chuckle when the moose griped about still having to make payments on the oven. Bullwinkle also mentions having graduated from MIT -- the Moose Institute of Toe-Dancing, that is. Furthermore, Mr. Peabody the dog, a Harvard graduate, lives in a Manhattan penthouse, practices yoga and has an adopted son, because as he puts it: ""Every dog should have a boy."" Peabody chooses an orphan because he ""always roots for the underboy."" It's these little jokes that set the show apart from typical children's programming of its time. Today those jokes may not have us rolling on the floor laughing (or ROTFL, as the kids say), but they were the 1960s equivalent of Stewie's reaction to being rejected by ""American Idol"" on ""Family Guy."" The 50th anniversary of ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" also means that spy duo Boris & Natasha, Mr. Peabody & Sherman and the Fractured Fairytales are celebrating birthdays as well. Fractured Fairytales offered a skewed take on traditional children's stories. The moral was the same, but modern, funny dialogue was tossed in with slapstick humor. Rapunzel, for example, visits a barber shop and laments about having ""no future."" ""Incredible writing is the reason the show resonates to this day,"" Ward said. Today, cartoons are more popular than ever. There are cable networks devoted to animation, and it is commonplace for cartoons to be written specifically for adults. Fox's Sunday night animation domination block featuring ""The Simpsons"" and ""Family Guy"" comes to mind. ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" was among the first animated series to hit prime time television. Matt Groening even paid special homage to Jay Ward when he created ""The Simpsons"" by giving Bart, Homer and Grandpa Simpson the middle initial ""J,"" as in Rocky's full name: Rocket J. Squirrel. Tiffany Ward said she is thrilled there's such a wide array of animation available to viewers today, especially since in her father's era it was difficult to even get airtime for the genre. New projects are always coming the duo's way, and an animated Dreamworks feature film is in development.","50 years ago, Jay Ward's ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" debuted on ABC .

"(CNN) -- An FBI agent who was arrested in Pakistan this week after allegedly trying to board a flight with ammunition and knives has been released on bail, police in Pakistan said Thursday. FBI agent Joel Cox was released after paying about $10,000 bail in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi, senior police Officer Rao Anwar said. Cox was arrested Monday while trying to board a domestic flight between Karachi and Islamabad. He had 15 9mm bullets, three small knives and a wrench, according to police. The agent was visiting Pakistan as part of an assignment to train local police, a U.S. law enforcement official said. Employees for the FBI and other U.S. agencies are allowed to carry weapons in Pakistan when authorized. Cox is scheduled to appear in court Saturday to face anti-terrorism charges, which restrict unauthorized weapons and ammunition on commercial flights. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the United States is working with Pakistani authorities to resolve this issue. ""This individual detained is an employee of the FBI who was on a temporary duty assignment to provide routine assistance to the legal attachÃÂ© at the U.S. mission. But we are coordinating closely to resolve this manner with authorities and we are hopeful in that regard,"" Psaki said Wednesday. U.S. officials hope this incident is more easily resolved than the 2011 case of a CIA contractor who was arrested and charged with killing two men. Raymond Davis said that he believed they were trying to rob him. The case inflamed local anti-American sentiment and soured relations until the United States agreed to compensate the families of the two men. Davis was then freed.","The agent was released after paying about $10,000 in bail .

"(CNN) -- Residents of the Atchafalaya Basin in south-central Louisiana, already urged to evacuate, late Thursday awaited a formal decision on whether a spillway will be opened, sending millions of gallons of floodwaters their way. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is measuring the current flow of the Mississippi River at a river landing, and once it reaches a specified volume and velocity the Mississippi River Commission may make a decision on the Morganza Spillway. The move would help divert water from Baton Rouge and New Orleans, but it would send a torrent down the Atchafalaya River, Gov. Bobby Jindal said. He has advised residents in southeastern Louisiana to evacuate their homes, urging, ""Don't wait for the official notification."" Jindal said Thursday that state officials need several days after a Morganza decision to notify residents. A decision on the spillway's opening could come between Saturday and Tuesday, officials said. The Corps, meanwhile, continued to analyze multiple Mississippi River scenarios, depending on whether the spillway is closed, open or partially open. The U.S. Coast Guard said floodwaters could close the Mississippi to ships at the port of New Orleans as early as Monday morning, according to a spokesman. Vicksburg, Mississippi, Police Chief Walter Armstrong said 600 residents had been evacuated as of Thursday night. The Mississippi is expected to crest May 19 at 57.5 feet. Armstrong said he expected higher water Friday, with more homes affected. More than two dozen roads were closed and about 45 businesses will be closed by Friday. Across the South and lower Midwest, floodwaters have covered about 3 million acres of farmland, eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn, wheat, rice and cotton, officials said Thursday. In Arkansas, the Farm Bureau estimated that damage to the state's agriculture could top more than $500 million as more than 1 million acres of cropland are under water. ""It's in about 10 feet of water,"" Dyersburg, Tennessee, farmer Jimmy Moody said of his 440 acres of winter wheat, which was to be harvested in the coming month. Other farmers in Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas rushed to salvage what wheat they could ahead of the rising water. As for corn, farmers who were able to get into the fields during a soggy planting season in late March and April are seeing their crops in some cases under several feet of water. Farms near and on the Mississippi River are no strangers to flooding, but the 2011 flood is definitely one for the record books. ""This is new water that has reached areas for the first time in 75 years,"" said Lee Maddox of the Tennessee Farm Bureau. Of course, the flooding is covering more than farmland. In Louisiana alone, Jindal said, as many as 3 million acres -- of farms, forests and towns -- could be affected. In Mississippi, 600,000 acres of farmland are only part of 1.4 million acres likely to be flooded, said Andy Prosser of the state's Department of Agriculture and Commerce. With the overflowing Mississippi River bearing down on New Orleans, where the water level was already at flood stage, the Army Corps of Engineers said Thursday that it was opening more bays at the Bonnet Carre Spillway. Another 113 bays were opened, bringing the total to 223 open bays, authorities said. The 350-bay spillway, just north of New Orleans, diverts water into Lake Pontchartrain. The National Weather Service said that as of Thursday night, the river was at 17 feet in New Orleans, about an inch and a half above flood stage. It is expected to crest on May 23 at more than 19 feet. ""Nobody can wrap their heads around what's going to happen,"" said Caroline George of Baton Rouge. In a CNN iReport from her hometown, where the 19-year-old is on summer break from college, she said, ""I've never seen the river anywhere near where it is now."" The National Guard is working around the clock to construct a flood barrier in Morgan City, Louisiana. In Memphis, which endured a record river crest this week, flooding affected between 800 and 1,000 properties, said Steve Schuler of the local emergency management agency. Many small businesses and farms were affected in Shelby County, and the river level was still high Thursday, he said. Rain moved into the area Thursday night, according to county officials, and Shelby residents were being reminded about five shelters. ""Many people who chose to stay in their homes during the flood are now surrounded by floodwater and are in need of food and other supplies,"" the Shelby County Emergency Operations Center said. Some Memphis roads remained closed, and an unspecified number of customers won't see power restoration for several days. Flooding also continues to be a problem in southeastern Missouri and southern Illinois, though the Mississippi and Ohio rivers have crested in those states. Several roads were closed Thursday in Mississippi. Back in Louisiana, ""the Bonnet Carre Spillway was partially opened on Monday ... in order to keep the volume of the Mississippi River flows at New Orleans from exceeding 1.25 million cubic feet per second,"" the Corps said. But the muddy water exceeded that level, with a flow of 1.36 million cubic feet per second by Wednesday night, authorities said. Twenty-six parishes in the state have declared states of emergency ahead of the surging waters. A nuclear unit in Louisiana may have to shut down if Mississippi River levels are too high, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Waterford Steam Electric Station Unit 3, about 25 miles west of New Orleans, was back online Thursday after being shut April 6 to refuel and replace the main generator. Entergy Louisiana, which owns the plant, said flooding is not expected with the opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway. But if the river exceeds 27 feet, the plant would be forced to shut down because a circulating water system that drives the turbine would not be able to operate. Throughout the region, the economic toll has yet to be calculated. In Mississippi's Tunica County, rising water shut down lucrative casinos that generate $85 million a month in taxes. ""We've created a barrier around the perimeter of the casino and hotel,"" said George Goldhoff, general manager of the Gold Strike Casino. ""As of now, we remain dry inside that perimeter."" The emotional toll of a long-running natural disaster can be hard to gauge, said Paige Roberts with the American Red Cross in Mississippi. ""Emotional care is going to be just as much of a need as someplace to sleep and a warm meal to eat,"" she said.  ""We're still at a point where it's not time to panic, but it is time to prepare, and that's how we're going to get to the finish line of this arduous marathon."" Fourteen Mississippi counties affected by flooding have been declared major disaster areas eligible for federal assistance, Gov. Haley Barbour announced Wednesday in a statement released by his office. ""We are grateful to President (Barack) Obama and FEMA for quickly fulfilling our request for assistance,"" Barbour said. ""The flooding situation will last for several weeks, and this declaration gives Mississippians in flooded areas access to federal assistance that can help families through this difficult time.""

"(CNN) -- University of Notre Dame senior Emily Toates, like many in the Catholic faith, is angry over her school's decision to give President Obama an honorary degree at this weekend's commencement. Notre Dame senior Emily Toates says she will not attend her school's main graduation ceremony. She's doing something about it: skipping the event. ""I do not feel comfortable going and celebrating him as the university hands him an honorary degree -- in a sense honoring his policies,"" Toates said. On Sunday, Obama will become one of many sitting U.S. presidents to deliver the commencement address at the Catholic institution. The honor comes much to the chagrin of anti-abortion groups and Catholics protesting the president's pro-choice, pro-stem cell research views. ND Response, an anti-abortion student group that Toates is working with, will boycott the graduation ceremony in protest. Other anti-abortion groups have started petitions against Obama's appearance and have plans to protest his visit to the South Bend, Indiana, campus. ""It's not a political issue; this is an issue of human dignity, and it's a Catholic issue,"" Greer Hannan, a Notre Dame graduating senior, said in a statement. ""As a Catholic university, we need to stand up for it."" The group said it has received official permission to hold a ""prayerful and constructive demonstration"" on the university's south quad on graduation day, according to a statement. Notre Dame has said all views are welcome, no matter the speaker's party affiliation. In a statement in March, Notre Dame President John I. Jenkins said that does not mean the university agrees with all of Obama's positions. The White House has said the president is honored to be speaking at the university and welcomes the exchange of ideas on hot-button topics. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters that Obama will ""obviously make mention of the debate that's been had."" ""This is a commencement ceremony, a special occasion for families to celebrate ... the president will understand that's the most important aspect of the day,"" Gibbs said. Toates, who will instead walk across the stage at her department's ceremony on Saturday, said the appearance has created a division on campus over whether the Democratic president should be allowed to speak and receive an honor.  Watch Toates discuss her decision Â» . She said that if Obama had been asked to speak in a different context, the uproar would not be there. ""If he was invited to a town hall meeting, a panel discussion, something where we were discussing these issues ... then I wouldn't have a problem with it. I would go and hear what he has to say,"" she said. ""The problem is, a commencement isn't the context for a dialogue. He's going to be standing up on the stage speaking to us in our seats. There isn't that opportunity for dialogue."" It's a point with which one top Catholic agrees. ""I have no problem with Obama speaking on the campus. ... I have no problem with him addressing the law school, being involved in this symposium. ... I do have a problem giving him the honor,"" said Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League.  Watch more of Donohue's take Â» . But history and peace studies major Michael Angullo said most students stand behind Notre Dame's invitation even if they don't agree with all of Obama's policies. ""Don't think less of the University of Notre Dame,"" Angullo said. ""Don't let this mission be corrupted by a president whose thoughts on this issue are different than Catholic thoughts. Be willing to engage in that."" A poll out Thursday suggested that most U.S. Catholics want Notre Dame to allow Obama to speak. Sixty percent of Catholic voters sampled in the Quinnipiac University survey said Notre Dame should not rescind its invitation to the president. Observant Catholic voters who attend religious services about once a week say by a 49 percent to 43 percent margin that Notre Dame should keep Obama on the program. Catholics who attend services less frequently say by a 70 percent to 26 percent margin that Obama should speak, according to the poll. ""Neither Americans overall, nor Roman Catholic voters in particular, think Notre Dame should rescind its invitation to President Obama,"" said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. ""The strongest opposition to the president's appearance comes from observant Catholics, but more of them than not say he should be allowed to speak."" The poll, taken April 21-27, surveyed 2,041 registered voters nationwide. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. ""Catholics are not a monolithic group. If you divide between practicing Catholics and nonpracticing Catholics, you'll find that the practicing Catholics for some reason are opposed to Obama getting an honor. They're not opposed to him speaking at Notre Dame; they're opposed to him being honored,"" Donohue said.","Notre Dame student says ""I do not feel comfortable going and celebrating"" Obama .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration's got some good news on Obamacare. Scratch that. It was arguably great news. Despite the jumbo embarrassment of a flawed rollout, a website that barely worked for more than a month, and hellfire and brimstone headlines that impacted public perceptions of the law, it turns out people are signing up. Millions of them. According to data released Wednesday, more than 1 million people signed up for private health insurance under the Obamacare exchanges during January. That raised the open enrollment total during the first four months to 3.3 million. Obamacare sign-ups jump to 3.3 million . With six weeks left for people to enroll under current deadlines, there is an outside chance the Obama administration could hit its goal of 7 million by the end of March. Seems like a big deal, right? You wouldn't know it from the way the White House rolled out the news, quietly on a media conference call with the Department of Health and Human Services. There was no TV-friendly event featuring President Barack Obama. Instead, he appeared in public on Wednesday only to sign an executive order raising the minimum wage for the employees of contractors entering into new agreements with the federal government. Read the new report . Sure, that's a big symbolic move. But its impact is fractional compared to those affected by a fully functioning health law. Plus, the ratio of sign ups 18 to 34 ticked up in the last reporting month to 25% of the total. And they're buying mid-range plans that are more generous but cost more with higher monthly premiums. It's not the 40% young people ratio that government economists have said will be needed to make the program financially workable. But the administration's argument has always been younger enrollees -- less interested in the law and less in need of benefits -- would generally be the last to sign up. New system system to measure payments for Obamacare coverage . So why then, as National Review points out, is the Political Action Committee controlled by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi running TV ads for Democratic Rep. Joe Garcia in Florida that don't brag about how the law is turning around? Instead, Garcia is promising to stand up to insurance companies to fix it. Obama, in his State of the Union address in January, implored Republicans to work with Democrats on the law instead of continuing the years long political game of finding ways to vote against it. A strategy that Democrats quickly found ways to squelch in the Senate. ""Let's not have another 40-something votes to repeal a law that's already helping millions of Americans,"" Obama said. ""The first 40 were plenty."" Republicans, even as they clearly move away from a strategy of trying to repeal the law, will still use it as a political bludgeon against Democrats in the run up to midterm elections. It remains an issue that is important to the GOP base. Democrats, for their part, will try to frame Republican assaults on the law as attempts to take something tangible -- cancer treatment, say, or health insurance -- away from people. Talking to Democratic strategists, you won't hear any of them telling candidates to run on Obamacare no matter how good the numbers look and no matter if it starts to appear that the law is working. And you can't blame them. For all the talk of Obamacare as Obama's signature -- literally, his name is in the colloquial title -- achievement, the law dominated the political conversation for years. The backlash cost Democrats their majority in the House. Public support, never strong, is still below 50% for the Affordable Care Act even as millions sign up for coverage. New delay ensures Obamacare to be issue in 2014, 2016 elections . That's why even as portions of the law seem ready to finally, potentially, work, Democrats seem keen to move on even as they try not to run away from the politics of Obamacare. ""There's a disconnect between talking about numbers in the exchanges and how this law affects people in their every day lives,"" said Matt Canter, spokesman for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. ""Democratic candidates are going to be talking about preexisting conditions, consumer protections, protecting Medicare benefits. These are health care issues that relate to people in (their) every day lives and Republicans are on the wrong side of these issues,"" he said.","3.3 million signed up during the four months of Obamacare open enrollment so far .
The ratio of people 18 to 34 signing up for plans increased to 25% .
Despite this success, Democratic strategists will likely not advise candidates to run on Obamacare .
Republicans will still use problems with Obamacare to hit Democrats hard ."
"(CNN) -- Three people have been arrested in connection to the case of a stolen Stradivarius in Milwaukee, but the violin remains missing. Authorities are urging anyone with information to come forward. ""We do not have the violin. As is known, there is a substantial reward out for that violin, and we urge the community to do what it can to develop information and to help us identify, and locate, and recover this priceless instrument,"" Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn told reporters Wednesday. The reward is up to $100,000, according to CNN affiliate WITI, which reports the instrument itself is worth an estimated $6 million. Flynn described the three suspects as a 36-year-old man, a 41-year-man, and a 32-year-old woman, all from Milwaukee. He did not identify them by name, and no one has been formally charged. The suspects were arrested Monday and remain in custody. ""We're confident the subjects in custody are the subjects responsible for this,"" said G.B. Jones, acting special agent in charge with the FBI in Milwaukee. At this point, Flynn said, authorities have no indication the three suspects were working for anyone but themselves. He described them as ""engaged in the process"" and said that interviews are ongoing. ""Clearly, we want to indicate that it's perhaps in their best interests to recognize that ... this is not something that can easily be disposed of at some future date. It'll never be valuable for a thief. It's only valuable for a collector. It's only valuable to a collector if it can be played, and it can't be played if it's known to be stolen,"" the chief said. The Stradivarius was stolen last week from Frank Almond, concertmaster of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. Almond was walking to his car after a performance on January 27 when an assailant used a stun gun on him, causing him to drop the instrument. The attacker then took the violin and fled to a waiting vehicle, which was being driven by a second suspect, police said. That vehicle was described as a late 1980s or early 1990s, maroon or burgundy, Chrysler or Dodge minivan. Authorities are still looking for that van. According to the symphony, Almond plays on a violin made by Antonio Stradivari from 1715, known as the ""ex-Lipinski."" Antonio Stradivari was born in 1644. He set up shop in Cremona, Italy, where he made violins, harps, guitars, violas and cellos. Before his death in 1737, Stradivari is thought to have made more than 1,100 instruments -- of which some 650 remain today. He is the world's most celebrated violin maker.

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- Buddhist monks and others armed with swords and machetes Friday stalked the streets of a city in central Myanmar, where sectarian violence that has left about 20 people dead has begun to spread to other areas, according to local officials. Members of the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Meiktila township have clashed this week after a dispute between a Muslim gold shop owner and two Buddhist sellers Wednesday ignited simmering communal tensions. Rioters have set fire to houses, schools and mosques, prompting thousands of residents to flee their homes amid unrest that had echoes of sectarian troubles that killed scores of people in western Myanmar last year. Late Friday night, President Thein Sein announced on state television that four townships in the affected region are under a state of emergency. The United Nations and the United States have expressed concern about the violence in the lakeside city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Mandalay. Win Htein, an opposition member of parliament for Meiktila, said the number of dead in the city has risen to about 20 by his estimate -- most of them Muslims -- after charred bodies were found in the streets. ""I have not seen this scale of violence before in my life,"" he said. ""I am very sad. The community used to live in peace."" Myanmar is emerging from decades of military repression and has taken a number of significant steps toward democracy in recent years under President Thein Sein. But it has been plagued by bouts of ethnic violence that some analysts say are a byproduct of the changing political climate. Burning mosques . A group of about 100 Buddhists, including some monks, went around Meiktila on Thursday night torching mosques, said Police Lt. Col. Aung Min, and while most of them have returned home, some are still wandering the streets, carrying weapons. Although Aung Min declined to provide an official death toll, he said the violence had spread to a nearby town, Win Twin, where a mosque was burned down overnight. He said about 1,000 Muslims had taken temporary shelter in a soccer stadium in Meiktila, where about 30% of the 100,000 residents are estimated to be Muslims. Win Htein said he believed that more than 5,000 Buddhists had fled to monasteries around the city to escape the violence. Many members of both communities had lost their homes, he said. Journalists in the city who tried to take photos of the clashes said they were threatened by Buddhists, some of them monks, who were holding sticks and knives. Violence in Rakhine . In the western state of Rakhine, tensions between the majority Buddhist community and the Rohingya, a stateless ethnic Muslim group, boiled over into clashes that killed scores of people and left tens of thousands of others living in makeshift camps last year. Most of the victims were Rohingya. ""The ongoing intercommunal strife in Rakhine State is of grave concern,"" the International Crisis Group said in a November report. ""And there is the potential for similar violence elsewhere, as nationalism and ethno-nationalism rise and old prejudices resurface."" A failure by authorities to address deepening divisions between the communities could result in a resumption of violence in the future, the report said, ""which would be to the detriment of both communities, and of the country as a whole."" Vijay Nambiar, special adviser to the U.N. secretary-general on Myanmar, on Thursday expressed ""deep sorrow at the tragic loss of lives and destruction"" in Meiktila this week. He called for ""firm action"" from Myanmar authorities, combined with ""the continued fostering of communal harmony and preservation of peace and tranquility among the people."" Win Htein, the local lawmaker, said that he believed there were now about 1,000 police officers in the area. He said he had spoken to Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate and leader of the opposition National League for Democracy, who had said local authorities should use police to control the situation according to the law. The U.S. ambassador to Myanmar, Derek Mitchell, said Thursday that he was ""deeply concerned"" about the reports of violence. Journalist Phyo Wai Lin reported from Yangon, CNN's Kocha Olarn reported from Bangkok, Thailand, and CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","Four townships in central Myanmar under a state of emergency, the president says .

"(The Frisky)  -- This week Joaquin Phoenix went on ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" -- clean-shaven and once again good-looking -- to apologize for the stunt he pulled when he appeared on the show in character for the flick ""I'm Still Here."" Joaquin assured us that Letterman was not in on the joke. But it got us thinking -- why is ""Letterman"" the place celebrities go to unleash their crazy? Do they drug stars in the green room? Or does David make people feel so uncomfortable that they let out their inner freak? Who knows? But we rounded up the 10 most insane David Letterman interviews in our recent memory. The Frisky: 9 celebrities try to explain why they cheated . 1.Wacky Joaquin . Starting, of course, with Joaquin's February 2009 interview, during which he revealed that he was retiring from acting and embarking on a rap career. His shaggy beard, sunglasses at night, one-word answers to questions, and overall twiggy, skittish behavior had us seriously worried. 2. Drew flashed Dave . Drew Barrymore seems so together these days that it's easy to forget that she was once a total mess. Case in point: her 1995 interview with Letterman. It's hard to believe that she wasn't on anything when she revealed that her birthday usually makes her nauseous and talked about how liberating stripping is. Then Drew jumped on the desk and proceeded to flash Dave. 3. Madonna made us cringe . A year earlier, Madonna made quite a spectacle of herself on ""Letterman."" After berating Dave for being so interested in her sex life and calling him a ""sick [expletive],"" she said, ""Aren't you going to smell them? I gave him my underpants and he won't smell them."" This was during her Goth phase, when she was rocking black hair and combat boots, and more attitude. The Frisky: 12 celebs who deny getting breast implants despite radical pics . 4. Farrah was acting weird . In 1997, Farrah Fawcett appeared on the cover of Playboy and did a Pay-Per-View special called ""All of Me."" And she made an appearance on ""David Letterman,"" which she was late for because there were ""people, lots of people."" She revealed that she and her mother had to have conceived on the same day, since their children have the same birthday. But the best moment was when she got totally confused and paused for a while. ""Wow. I really thought I was looking out the window,"" she said, before giggling compulsively. 5. Crispin's awkward interview . Crispin Glover was so cute and innocent in ""Back to the Future."" But he ruined it all when he appeared on ""Letterman"" in 1987 to promote his movie ""River's Edge."" And it wasn't just the bad wig, '70s shirt, striped pants, and platform shoes that turned the world off. ""I'm a movie star,"" he declared, awkwardly. Then he challenged David to an arm-wrestling match. The Frisky: 10 stars with bad body habits . 6. Paris squirmed . In 2007, Paris Hilton went on ""Letterman"" after her stint in the slammer and the whole thing was just uncomfortable. ""How'd you like being in jail?"" David asked, just a few seconds in. ""Not too much,"" she replied. Yes, he also asked about the food. ""It's not supposed to be good -- it's jail,"" she said. 7. Cher was defensive . Isn't it weird that Cher looks younger now (see the recent MTV VMA show, anyone?) than she did in her 1986 ""Letterman"" interview? For her 1996 appearance, she kept her hands firmly across her chest. When David asked why she refused to come on the show for years and then relented, Cher explained, ""I want to pay my hotel bill. I have a huge hotel bill. I thought I'd come on and see what this guy is like."" So what did she think? ""You're an [insert a not-so-nice-name for 'jerk']."" 8. Courtney pulled a ""Drew"" Nearly a decade later, Courtney Love went on ""Letterman"" wearing almost the same ensemble that Drew Barrymore sported on the show. Before she even sat down, she flashed him. Then she did it again and again, before falling off a chair. ""I learned how to flirt from watching David Letterman flirt with Sandra Bernhard. It has been the crisis of all my dysfunctional relationships ever since,"" she said. Yowch. The Frisky: 13 Hollywood guys who fell for regular gals . 9. Andy Kaufman's big joke . Andy Kaufman isn't known for his straight interviews. In 1982, he appeared on ""Letterman"" with wrestler Jerry Lawler. Why? Because part of Kaufman's shtick was wrestling women, and as such, Lawler challenged him to a match. During the interview, Lawler slaps Kaufman, which leads to a tirade worthy of a ""Real Housewife."" We'll never know if this whole bit was staged. 10. Borat bombed . We know what to expect from Sacha Baron Cohen when he's in character as Borat, but David Letterman didn't seem prepared. Seems he thought he was getting an interview with Sacha proper. When David asked about Sacha's wife, he was no doubt referring to Isla Fischer. But Sacha responded, ""My wife is dead. High five. When I buy my wife, she was very nice, she cook good, she was strong on plow. But after three years when she was 15, her voice got deep and she grow much hair on chest."" David was not amused.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- One of Justin Bieber's security guards and a driver were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of stealing a photographer's camera in Sandy Springs, Georgia. The photographer was waiting outside of a suburban Atlanta arcade Bieber was in when the guard confronted the photographer, according to Steve Rose, a spokesman for the Sandy Springs Police Department. The photographer left and was then followed by the bodyguard and another man driving a Cadillac Escalade, Rose said. The men stopped the photographer's car in an adjacent parking lot. The security guard then took the camera from the photographer and fled to the home Bieber is renting in Sandy Springs, Rose said. A police officer stopped the bodyguard and the driver in the driveway, spotted the camera and took both men into custody. They have since been identified by police as 32-year-old Hugo Hesny, the guard, and 49-year-old Terrance Johnson, the driver. Both men were initially charged with felony theft of the camera, estimated to be worth $10,000. Johnson was later released and charges were dropped, police said. A small amount of marijuana also was found in the Escalade, along with some pipes commonly used to smoke it. Because of the small amount of pot, no charges were filed, according to a police statement. Bieber was not involved in the incident. A representative for the singer declined to comment. CNN first learned of the arrests on Twitter. The People v. Justin Bieber: The singer's court cases .
