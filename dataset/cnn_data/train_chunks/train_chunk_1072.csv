"For a year-and-a-half, Omar Kenawi and Susan Schlegel travelled back and forth between London and Los Angeles after meeting online and falling hopelessly in love. At 5,437 miles apart, the couple's relationship was just about as long-distance as it gets - but Mr Kenawi used that to his advantage. Knowing that his Broadway-loving girlfriend's favourite musical was Rent, he coordinated a surprise flashmob for her which culminated on him getting down on one knee. Luckily for him, in front of the flash mob that he had arranged and the crowd that gathered to watch the romantic gesture, as well as the camera crew he had brought in to record the proposal, she said yes. Scroll down for video . Moment of relief: After travelling from London to Los Angeles and organising an elaborate proposal, Susan Schlegel said yes to Omar Kenawi . Ms Schlegel and her husband-to-be had not seen each other for four months before he popped the question . 'Sue's favourite musical is Rent which I hadn't seen, so I watched it and loved it,' Mr Kenawi, 28, told ABC News. 'I picked my favourite song from the show, Seasons of Love, and I really wanted to make it special to us so I rewrote the lyrics to be more personal to our unique relationship.' The original song's lyrics ask: 'Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes. How do you measure, measure a year?' After finding out the distance from London to Los Angeles, the producer changed the words to: 'Five thousand, four hundred and thirty seven miles. How do you measure the distance of love?' and renamed the song Forever Love. Mr Kenawi emerges from the crowd to serenade his soon-to-be fiancée with a song from Rent . He gets down on one knee after the 5,437-mile flight and prays for the right answer . The happy couple kiss and Mr Kenawi's huge trip and elaborate plan have all been worth it . Mr Kenawi, who had not seen his girlfriend for four months before the proposal, relied on the help of Ms Schlegel's close friends and family to pull off the stunt - a group of around 35 all together. Ms Schlegel was led to Griffith Observatory, where the couple had spent a romantic evening in the past, under the impression that she was there for a marketing job. But when she was led outside, an a cappella group start to sing. Bemused, Ms Schlegel says, 'I love this,' as she watches the group  break out into song. Meanwhile a nervous Mr Kenawi hides just a few feet away, preparing himself for one of the most daunting moments of his life. As friends of Ms Schlegel begin to join the group she starts dancing, still completely oblivious to what is about to happen. At this point Mr Kenawi bites the bullet and emerges from behind, emerging in time to sing the final verse of his song. Happy couple: The pair have not set a wedding date yet, but after such an elaborate proposal, Ms Schlegel wants to plan a more 'intimate' ceremony . Speaking to her after the music stops, he says: 'I have travelled 5,437 miles to stand here before you today, but I would travel to the ends of the universe to be with you. 'Every minute without you has been an eternity, and every bumpy plane ride has been an absolute pleasure. 'You are the most beautiful, funny, thoughtful, and inspiring woman I have ever known, and I ever will know. 'You are my soulmate, my partner, my best friend, and you would make me the happiest man alive if you would give me the honour of sharing your life with me.' Mr Kenawi then gets down on one knee and pops the question, to which Ms Schlegel says yes as the crowd break into applause. 'Months of planning all hinged on that moment, and the excitement and elation we all felt at its success was something I'll never experience again,' Kenawi recalled. 'It was the best moment of my life. 'I was really nervous as months of planning had gone into that moment and I wanted to make it like a dream come true for her. 'She told me one of her wishes was to find herself in a musical scenario in her life and I wanted to make that happen for her.' The happy couple have not set a wedding date yet, but after such an elaborate proposal, Ms Schlegel says they would like to 'plan something intimate and unique,' about a year from now.","Omar Kenawi and Susan Schlegel have been dating since February 2013 .

"Forget the zippy motorbikes to get the delivery of burgers and fries to arrive on your doorstep as fast as possible - McDonald's fast food giant has pulled out the big guns with flashy sports cars. A white Lamborghini and red Ferrari were parked outside the South Melbourne outlet which was one of the first suburbs to trial the home delivery service back in July. The gleaming cars attracted a lot of attention from impressed customers who were taking photos on their phones of the new high-end delivery vehicles. Scroll down for video . Will this Lamborghini get your McDonald's food to you while it's still warm? Ferrari F430 Spider has a rear mid-engine and a rear-wheel drive layout with a 4.3 liter V8 petrol burner . The extravagant delivery service comes as the global net income of the major food supplier has recorded a profit drop of 30 per cent in the last quarter ending September 30. As competition against other fast-food suppliers rises, and a food scandal in China damaging the company's reputation in Asia, McDonald's has tried to redeem themselves through a number of campaigns that promote it as a healthy, classy option. Rob Moodie, a professor of public health at the University of Melbourne told Daily Mail Australia that he believes this continues to remain far from the truth. 'One would hope these changes are because we as consumers are more discerning and demanding of healthy food, because that's the only way that we would ever receive a change in McDonald's rather than through government regulation,' Professor Moodie said. 'They are the masters of marketing, they don't come much better than Ronald McDonald for instance – he's the 21st century pied piper.

The flashy display comes as the fast food giant has recorded a profit drop of 30 per cent in the last quarter ending September 30 .

There are least seven Sydney outlets and three stores in Melbourne that have already jumped on board the online delivery service trial.

"Jerry Hall poised to step out on the catwalk in 1995, Catherine Deneuve captured during a glamorous front row moment in 1988 and a dapper Yves Saint Laurent in a dicky bow surrounded by an array of striking models. These are just a few of the dazzling images in a new book about the legendary Yves Saint Laurent. The book is packed with photographs of the famous designer and his world of fashion, shot by New York-based fashion photographer Roxanne Lowit, a pioneer of backstage fashion photography. The designer, pictured above at a party for his Opium fragrance in 1978, made a lasting impression on the world of fashion and the people within it - not least photographer Roxanne Lowit . Left: Jerry Hall, pictured left poised to step out on the YSL catwalk in 1995; Right: Catherine Deneuve captured during a glamorous front row moment in 1988 . YSL’s muses and admirers including Jerry Hall, Grace Jones, Paloma Picasso and Catherine Deneuve have also contributed to the book with their personal tributes to the king of fashion. 'I had barely left Texas when I found myself modelling haute couture for Yves Saint Laurent,' writes Jerry Hall. 'It was the beginning of a great relationship. I count my lucky stars I was able to work with him for so many years. 'I might have been too exotic for Texas, but not too exotic to be the Opium girl for eight years, starting when Yves Saint Laurent launched the perfume in 1977,' she says. Left: A model from YSL's ready-to-wear collection in fall 1984, strikes a pose; Right: Haute couture from spring 1990 . The model adds: 'Yves was a darling, gentle man, who always wanted everyone around him to be happy!' Screen legend Catherine Deneuve writes: 'I suppose I am not the first to say he was very shy.' She says: 'Sometimes his shyness was innocent, like a child's, and like a child he liked having fun. 'When he designed something specifically for me they were always elegant and sophisticated clothes. Very feminine.' Yves Saint Laurent pioneered ready-to-wear and draw inspiration from diverse cultures and contexts. Pictured above, models backstage in 1984 . As the tributes attest, few couturiers were as influential as Yves Saint Laurent. He pioneered ready-to-wear and draw inspiration from diverse cultures and contexts. He was a master at telling new stories through his designs. Roxanne Lowit photographs and celebrity tributes create a glittering portrait of YSL . The designer made a lasting impression on the world of fashion and the people within it - not least photographer Roxanne Lowit.

Whether surrounded by beautiful models or peeking at the catwalk from the wings, Lowit says every moment with Yves Saint Laurent was a magnificent photo opportunity. The book comes ahead of a biopic, due out this November. Roxanne Lowit started taking pictures in the 1970s. Before long she was covering all the designers in Paris, where her friends, including models such as Jerry Hall, would sneak her backstage. Her photographs have appeared in many magazines, including Vogue, Vanity Fair, Elle, and Glamour. She has also worked on advertising campaigns for, among others, Dior, Barney’s and Vivienne Westwood.

"A student has started cooking his meals on the engine of his car to avoid over-priced service station sandwiches and junk food. Sports management student Alfred Cary, 22, cooks delicious food by placing it on the engine of his Ford Ka and going for long drives. The engine heats up to such a degree that by the end of his journey his food is steamed to perfection. Mr Cary, a fourth year student at the University of Edinburgh, rustles up mouth-watering steaks, succulent duck breast and even pigeon by wrapping the pre-prepared meals in tin foil and placing them under the bonnet while he drives. A La Car: Alfred Cary removing some tin-foil wrapped food from his engine.The 22-year-old student cooks food on his long car journeys to Edinburgh University . Alfred reaches into the engine block to retrieve his mouth-watering meal . The car cook says the tin foil forms a tight seal and the food doesn't get contaminated by engine smells . Mr Cary said: 'The food tastes really good, pretty much the same as if you steamed it at home. 'It doesn’t taste at all like oil or petrol fumes. The tin foil totally separates it from the engine.” Mr Cary started preparing his meals on wheels after he began making regular trips from his family home in Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire to Edinburgh. Finding that the only meals on offer were expensive fast food and greasy fry-ups from motorway service stations, he hit upon an innovative solution. The inventive chef decided to use a technique developed by long-distance truckers in the USA which involves double-wrapping food in tin foil and leaving it behind the grille next to the hot engine. Motorway meal: Alfred preparing apricot lamb to cook in his car. Student Alfred Cary, 22, cooks delicious grub grilled on the engine of his Ford Ka . Alfred's girlfriend Claudia Cristwell enjoying a tuna burger prepared in the car's engine . He said: 'I was driving with my brother and he had read about engine cooking somewhere, so we decided to skip the motorway services on our journey home. 'We made lamb chops the first time. They tasted phenomenal when we got them out of the engine. 'It makes sense - why pay someone to heat food up for on the road you when you have a heat source going to waste right right there in front of you?' Mr Cary now uses his engine to prepare food whenever he is on the road and enjoys the luxury of tucking into gourmet home-cooked meals surrounded by the picturesque British countryside. He keeps an old wine box full of kitchen utensils, horseradish, harissa, herbs, spices and olive oil in the boot of his car. Mr Cary  prepares food whenever he is on the road and enjoys the luxury of tucking into home-cooked meals surrounded by the British countryside . He said: 'I prepare something beforehand and stick it under the bonnet just before I set off. When it has cooked I pull over to the side of the road and enjoy it in a nice spot. 'I never drive just to cook, I only ever cook when I drive. It is more environmentally-friendly that way.” Mr Cary has used his unusual cooking technique to impress his girlfriend Claudia Cristwell, 21, by taking her on romantic drives with dinner cooking in the engine. He said: 'I have prepared sea bass and a tuna burger for my girlfriend while out driving - she loves it.' Roasted pepper is among the many dishes the enterprising young cook can whip up . Mr Cary has even written a cookbook entitled ‘Carbecue: The Complete Guide to Cooking on a Car Engine’ which instructs readers on how to prepare delicious meals on their own motors. The ‘a la car’ menu contains 25 recipes which vary depending on journey time. A baked camembert can be prepared over a 25 minute drive, while a five-spice duck breast with noodles takes one hour. Mr Cary can rev up Chinese pork tenderloin during a one hour 50 minute journey. He said: 'My favourite dish to cook is the oriental sea bass with lemon, chilli and ginger on a bed of spinach. 'I had read some guides on how to cook using your engine but every recipe was for processed sausages. I wanted to show that you can prepare really delicious meals.” The book, priced £11.95 is on sale at www.carbecue.co.uk .

"A Purple Heart medal posthumously awarded to a soldier who died in Vietnam is being returned to his family 15 years after it was found on a school playground. Thomas McGraw, from North Syracuse, New York, was killed in 1966, aged 19, and his teenage widow and young daughter were presented with the medal after his death. The Purple Heart later disappeared and turned up in the late 1990s, when a young boy found it outside an elementary school in Syracuse. Honor: The posthumous medal of Pfc. Thomas McGraw, who died in Vietnam aged 19, is being returned to his family 15 years after it was stolen . Robyn DeCuffa, 51, was just three when she lost her father, and the medal was one of very few mementos she had left of him. The mother-of-eight had been given the medal by her mother Sarah, who had become a widow at 19 when Pfc. McGraw was killed in an ambush in February 1966 while serving with the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. Reunited: Pfc. McGraw's daughter Robyn DeCuffa, 51, thought her father's medal was lost forever . It was stolen from Ms DeCuffa some 15 years ago, and foundby a fourth-grader outside a school in Liverpool, New York. In January this year, the mother of the boy who found the medal contacted Purple Hearts Reunited, an organisation which returns lost or stolen military medals to their rightful owners, which tracked down Ms DeCuffa and her mother. 'I was actually shocked,' Ms DeCuffa,  of Cortland, told the Syracuse Post-Standard. 'I thought the Purple Heart was gone forever. That was basically all I had from my father.' The Purple Heart is  awarded to those serving in the US army who have been wounded or killed while on active duty, on or after April 5, 1917. Purple Hearts Reunited, founded by Captain Zac Fike, a member of the Army National Guard in Vermont, says Pfc. Thomas McGraw's medal will be presented to the family at a ceremony in Manlius, near Syracuse, next month. 'It really is quite an amazing story,' Ms DeCuffa told the paper. 'What this captain has done, returning medals to families, is such a fine act. 'I thought I would never see the medal again. 'It may seem small to other people, but when your father sacrifices his life for his country, that's really all you have.'

"Honey Boo Boo's Uncle Poodle has vowed he will fight for custody of the child reality star if her mother does not end her relationship with a convicted child molester. Uncle Poodle - real name Lee Thompson - and his fiance Alan plan to file for temporary custody of Honey Boo Boo if Mama June does not completely sever ties with Mark McDaniel. According to TMZ, sources have revealed that Uncle Poodle has researched the ground rules for winning temporary custody and he said they are getting a new, larger apartment with a spare bedroom. Scroll down for video . Uncle Poodle (pictured) - real name Lee Thompson - and his fiance Alan plan to file for temporary custody of Honey Boo Boo if Mama June does not completely sever ties with Mark McDaniel .

"Disney has announced huge profits from its movie studios, the same day it confirmed that the Toy Story franchise will return to cinemas in 2017 with a fourth installment. Pictures such as Frozen, as well as hits from its Marvel Studios subsidiary including The Avengers, Iron Man 3 and Guardians of the Galaxy, made an average of $1billion in global box office receipts, the company's CEO said. Bob Iger talked up the media company's studio successes during an earnings conference Thursday, the same day he announced that Toy Story creator John Lasseter would return to direct the fourth movie in the beloved franchise. Scroll down for video . The return: Disney's movie division had strong results - with particular excitement attendant on the newly-announced Toy Story four, featuring favorites Buzz Lightyear, right, Woody, front and center, T-rex, back right and Mr Potato Head, far left . Update: The new film, featuring tablets where in the 1995 original there was only Etch-a-Sketch, is set for studio release in 2017, and will be directed by creator John Lasseter . However, while Disney's film successes impressed, other holdings including the ABC and ESPN cable networks and other media interests dampened optimism, with the result of an overall drop in the company's share price. Disney's value dipped one per cent yesterday, after announced figures for cable earnings fell short of predictions,CNBC reported. But financial results will do little to halt the enthusiasm around the latest Toy Story film. In a separate announcement, Iger welcomed back John Lasseter, who wrote the story for all three films and directed the first two. He said: 'John created Toy Story and directed its first two films and it's great to have him back directing one of our most valuable properties.' Marvelous: Disney's acquisition of Marvel Studios is paying dividends, with billion-dollar profits from films like Marvel's The Avengers, as well as separate films starring Captain America (Christopher Evans, center), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr, right) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth, second from left) Newcomer: 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy also contributed to the $1.78billion revenues at Disney Studios . Lasseter himself said the film will 'open a new chapter' in the lives of its main characters, Woody the cowboy and space ranger Buzz Lightyear. The original 1995 film was the first fully computer-animated feature-length film, and made $361million at the box office. Sequels followed with 1999's Toy Story 2, and the much-anticipated Toy Story 3 in 2010. Good news in the movie business comes at a challenging time. Movie studios, TV networks and cable and satellite providers alike are grappling with a changing media industry as more people watch TV and movies online and via streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. HBO made waves recently by saying it would offer a standalone streaming service late next year. Some have speculated that Disney's ESPN network may do the same - but Iger batted away the idea, saying that cable channel bundles are still the best choice for consumers. Keeping on: Older hits including Frozen are still bolstering Disney's bottom line thanks to home releases . Princess cash: Frozen, starring Elsa the Snow Queen, was another of Disney's billion-dollar moneymakers . He said there are 101 million households with a cable or satellite subscription in the U.S., down  from 101.5 million last year. He said: 'While clearly the economy has had some impact over the last few years and we do see the millennials seem to be becoming subscribers a little bit later than perhaps they used to, we just feel that when you look at the quality of what's offered, meaning the number channels in the programming across those channels, and you consider the price, that is likely to remain dominant for a long time.' He added that he didn't think there is a need to create a standalone ESPN streaming service since that might erode the popularity of cable bundles. 'To do it at a point where you are endangering your own business model which is already facing a fair amount of challenge because of all the changing dynamics of the media landscape, it doesn't make sense to us right now,' he said.

"Up to 100 girls are being aborted every year in Britain because of sex-selective terminations in some communities, research has suggested. An Oxford University study provides disturbing evidence that mothers of Indian origin are much more likely to abort girls than those from other backgrounds. MPs yesterday voted overwhelmingly in favour of a Bill that would ban abortions on the grounds of gender. Beautiful baby girl: Oxford research from the study period 1990-2005 found that the ratio of boys to girls born to Indian mothers having their third child was 114 to 100 a much higher than the ratio for mothers of all backgrounds of 104 to 100 . They voted 181 to one to make sex-selective abortions illegal, saying the current law had led to ‘widespread confusion’ about what was allowed. The Oxford study, which covered the years 1990 to 2005, found that the ratio of boys to girls born to Indian mothers having their third child was 114 to 100. This is much higher than the ratio for mothers of all backgrounds of 104 to 100, and is seen as a sign of sex-selective abortions. Lead author Sylvie Dubuc said the figures suggested that, on average, about 100 baby girls were missing from the birth register every year during the study period. Her research casts doubt on a government-commissioned study which found there was no evidence of sex-selective abortions in this country. Following a Daily Telegraph investigation in 2012, the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge two doctors who were caught on camera agreeing to arrange abortions of female foetuses. The then director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said: ‘The law does not, in terms, expressly prohibit gender-specific abortions.’ At the time, the Department of Health issued updated rules, saying the 1967 Abortion Act stated that abortion on the grounds of gender was illegal. But MPs say this is not enough, and yesterday they overwhelmingly backed Tory MP Fiona Bruce’s Abortion (Sex-Selection) Bill. It will now proceed to a second reading in the Commons in January, although it is unlikely to be given time for debate in the build-up to May’s General Election. The only MP who voted against it was Labour’s Glenda Jackson. 'Sex-selective abortions are happening': Tory MP Fiona Bruce has introduced the Abortion (Sex-Selection) Bill to curb the practise . Miss Bruce said the law needed to be clarified to make it explicit to doctors that they cannot terminate pregnancies because of the sex of the unborn child. She added: ‘Sex-selective abortions are happening in the UK and there is widespread confusion over the law. That is why this Bill is needed. ‘Successive health ministers and even the Prime Minister have been very clear. They state that abortion for reasons of gender alone is illegal. But they are being ignored. 'The British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which performs around 60,000 abortions a year, are still advising women in one of their leaflets and on their website that abortions for reasons of foetal sex is not illegal because the law is silent on the matter. ‘The British Medical Association ... argue there may be cases where having a child of a particular gender may be a legal and ethical justification for an abortion on the grounds that the sex of the child may severely affect the pregnant woman’s mental health.’ A poll commissioned by Christian Concern found that 84 per cent of people believe gender abortion should be ‘explicitly banned by law’. Rani Bilkhu, from campaign group Jeena International, said British Asian women, as well as those born in South Asia and married to men in the UK, were aborting girls because of the cultural pressure to have sons – often from their in-laws. She told the BBC: ‘We have a high rate of women coming to us and saying, “We are being threatened and coerced to having abortions – we are being thrown down the stairs.” Once this bill comes out, we can then make sure communities understand that it is illegal to abort on the basis of gender.’ Labour MP Virendra Sharma called for people pressurising Asian women to abort their female foetuses to be ‘named and shamed’ by the authorities.","MPs vote overwhelmingly for Bill to ban sex-selective terminations .

'No and my wife has asked me not to burn the grass,' the man replies. Joking, the royal then responds: 'Well at least he did as he's told'. Despite the man's impressive bar and barbecuing skills, eventing fans Lucy Sharpley and Harry Horrell were named the winners and presented with first prize, a bottle of Pol Roger champagne.

"David Cameron is set to hold crisis talks with Barack Obama and other world leaders over the Ebola outbreak. The Prime Minister will hold talks with the US President, as well as the leaders of Germany, France and Italy, during a conference call this afternoon about international efforts to counter the virus. It came after Mr Cameron pledged that the Government would do ‘everything we can to keep this country safe’ from the outbreak of deadly virus. Prime Minister David Cameron will today hold crisis talks with US President Barack Obama over the Ebola epidemic . The discussion comes as it was revealed that a second US health care worker had tested positive for the illness, which has already claimed almost 4,500 lives, mainly in west Africa. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Mr Cameron stressed there were no direct flights from the affected areas, though screening processes beginning at Heathrow Airport were being rolled out. He told MPs: ‘There'll be another Cobra meeting chaired today by the Foreign Secretary, I'll be chairing one tomorrow. ‘We're looking at all these issues about where people are arriving to and co-operating properly with all the devolved authorities.' The Prime Minister added: ‘It is worth stressing there are no direct flights from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea into the United Kingdom, so we're talking about people who come here indirectly, and that is why it's so important we put in place the screening processes starting at Heathrow but to be rolled out more as the days go by. ‘I'm absolutely convinced that we will do everything we can to keep this country safe. I will make sure that proper liaison not only with Northern Ireland but also with the Republic takes place.’ His comments came as DUP Parliamentary Group Leader Nigel Dodds urged the Prime Minister to liaise ‘very closely’ with Northern Ireland authorities on the issue of screening checks. A Liberian Red Cross 'burial' team arrive in the country's capital Monrovia today. Liberia is one of the worst-hit countries in West Africa . The Ebola epidemic has already claimed more than 4,000 lives, largely in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia . Mr Dodds said: ‘Given the very serious spread of the Ebola virus worldwide with reports that there could be up to 10,000 new cases per week by two months' time. ‘Will the Prime Minister as part of his meetings later today and in Cobra ensure that he liaises very, very closely with the authorities in Northern Ireland, given that we share a land frontier with another jurisdiction in relation to checks on people coming into the UK. ‘It's a very serious issue for Northern Ireland, it's a very serious issue potentially for the rest of the UK.’","PM will hold talks with the leaders of the US, Germany, France and Italy .

"Randy Brits have said holiday spirits and the thrill of not knowing if they'd get caught are the main reasons for having sex in airports. Instead of doing crosswords, reading or simply catching up on sleep whilst waiting for a flight, nine per cent of UK travellers are getting down and dirty in airports loos and storage rooms. The surprising results from a new poll conducted by flight comparison website Jetcost.co.uk revealed the growing trend of sexual encounters in terminals, suggesting the Airport Club is becoming as much of a phenomenon as the Mile-High Club. Naughty behaviour: A new survey has found that Brit travellers are getting up to no good in airport loos . 76% choose to have sex in airport toilets whilst 21% decided to take the risk in storage areas or rooms . Three quarters (76 per cent) choose to have sex in airport toilets while 21 per cent decided to take the risk in storage areas or rooms. Twelve per cent people who had had a sexual encounter at the airport admitted they had been caught by either staff or members of the public. When asked why they had sex at the airport, 32 per cent said they were 'in the holiday spirit' and 27 per cent admitted they wanted the 'thrill' of not knowing if they would get caught. All respondents were also asked if they had ever had a sexual encounter on an aircraft, to which only four per cent admitted to it. Thirty-one per cent of these had been caught in the act. When asked why they had sex at the airport 32% said they were 'in the holiday spirit' Forget checking emails when waiting for a flight, 9% choose to have airport sex instead . More than 2,520 respondents from across the UK were quizzed about their airport experiences. To determine whether this was purely a UK trend or something that was becoming popular in all Europe, 1,000 people from European countries were also polled. The results showed that Italians (17 per cent) are the most amorous when it comes to sexual encounters in airports, followed by the Spanish (14 per cent). Eight per cent from Germany gave in to their desires whilst only three percent of the French did the same. Passing time: Sitting around waiting and playing games were some of the other things Brit travellers did . The poll also found that 79 per cent of Brit travellers spent their time eating and drinking and half (52 per cent) decided to while away the hours by reading. Browsing duty free shops (30 per cent), sitting around waiting (24 per cent) and playing games (19 per cent) were some of the other things Brit holidaymakers did to pass time. The poll was conducted by flight comparison website Jetcost.co.uk and 2,521 UK respondents aged 18 and over were quizzed about their airport experiences. Antoine Michelat, co-founder of Jetcost.co.uk, said: 'These results shocked us a little. We're surprised that more people haven't been caught in the act. 'Clearly, intimate acts in airports are even more common than those that take place on planes! I suppose one of the reasons many people are tempted is the thrill of knowing you're not supposed to be doing what you're doing, where you're doing it.'","Holiday spirits and the thrill of getting caught reasons given for airport sex .

"US Army Green Berets have made a bleak  assessment of Afghan National Army soldiers after a doomed mission this year when many of the soldiers refused to show up and those who did refused to fight and hid behind rocks. The Afghan forces reportedly could not operate at night and were so unprepared that the Americans had to take the lead. Then, when the mission was only half finished, the Afghan soldiers quit, retreated to the trees and refused to push on. The Special Forces soldiers, among the most elite and best-trained in the US military, filed those reports in a declassified Pentagon briefing about the June friendly fire bombinh that left five Americans and one Afghan soldier dead. Unprepared: A report by Green Beret officers paints a bleak picture of Afghan National Army preparedness as American forces prepare to pull out . Green Berets: Special Forces soldiers are some of the most highly trained commandos in the US military with specialized skills for working with local soldiers like the Afghan National Army . A captain from Fifth Special Forces Group based out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, reported the dramatic shortcomings of Afghan soldiers as he defended the actions of his own troops, the Washington Times reports. His assessment is sharply different from the picture of the Afghan National Army projected by the Pentagon as the US military. Notably, Special Forces soldiers are specifically trained and educated on how to instruct and work with foreign soldiers in their own country. It is the primary mission of the Green Berets, which they have been performing around the world since the 1950s. On Sunday, the American-led coalition formally ended combat operations in the volatile Helmand Province and US Marines and British troops handed over their bases there to Afghan commanders. All but 12,500 coalition troops will pull out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014, leaving the ANA to protect the fragile nation from a resurgent Taliban. According to the Times, the mission on June 5 began badly when far fewer Afghan troops showed up than had been requested by the Green Berets. 'They do not always show up with the forces promised. This was not ideal,' the American officer wrote. Too few Afghan soldiers show up, and those who do show up are often reluctant to fight, the Green Berets claimed in a new report . The mission was to clear a valley of Taliban fighters so that local residents could vote in the Afghan election. The insurgents had vowed to attack polling places and voters in an attempt to scare Afghans away. When the troops were flown into the valley, the captain writes, 'the (Green Berets) took point due to the ANA’s inability to move during periods of darkness.' As the forces began clearing the valley, the Green Berets noted that most of the soldiers refused to move out in the open and instead hid in the 'green zone' - a swath of protected trees. Midway through the mission, the Green Berets report, the Afghan soldiers just gave up. 'The (Green Berets) recommended to the (Afghan commander) to move positions and continue clearing further down the valley. The (commander) claimed to have cleared the entire valley but our positions identified that they had cleared only half of the valley. According to the (commander) that was as much clearance as they were going to conduct.' Then, after an American bomber killed five Americans and an Afghan in a friendly fire accident, the Green Berets told the remaining Afghan soldiers to form a perimeter so that the rescue and recovery operation could begin. 'They instead huddled behind a rock,' a Green Beret wrote. Defense Department investigators largely blamed the Special Forces soldiers for the errant bombing in the report, which was released last month. They said that the elite soldiers had 'poor situational awareness'  when they called in the air strike. The bomber crew was blamed for failing to correctly identify the target.","Reports from Special Forces officers differ dramatically from the rosy picture of the Afghan National Army painted by the Pentagon .

"It was a dog day afternoon in New York City today as hundreds of pups and their kooky owners paraded around in Tompkins Square Park. Presented by Purina Beggin Strips dog treats, the 24th annual Tompkins Square Halloween Dog Parade in lower Manhattan was a woofing good time.

The first place winners in round one and two go home with a blue ribbon along with two tickets to see either Cabaret or The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time on Broadway. The New York Daily News reports that these pet owners are animals when it comes to competition and some of them prepare for weeks-- even months ahead of the competition. Some spend hundreds of dollars on hiring stylists and costume designers to dress their canine companions.

'It’s sort of like the pet version of stage moms,' said dog owner Marin Feldman. 'You can’t be famous yourself, but you can have a dog that is.' While this year’s winning pooch hasn't been announced yet there were certainly some highlights among the crowd. One dog owner turned Game of Thrones into Game of Bones by dressing one pup as Khaleesi and the other as John Snow. The parade attracted all types of attendees including the Woof of Wall Street who took a moment away from the office to attend the parade. Even the Pope made an appearance and was dressed in his finest attire. The undead rose from the grave to walk in the parade as well.

"David Cameron and Ed Miliband are being told to ‘wake up’ to public anger over uncontrolled migration following Ukip’s stunning by-election advances. Nigel Farage’s party caused a political earthquake by seizing one Tory safe seat and coming within a few hundred votes of taking another from Labour. Conservative MPs warned the Prime Minister that he must now harden his stance on free movement within the European Union. There have been calls for David Cameron to break up the coalition early and make a pact with Ukip at the next election, while Jack Straw told Ed Miliband he has a 'lot more' to do . Nigel Farage was celebrating the election of their first MP yesterday after Douglas Carswell was elected in Clacton with a majority of 12,404, larger than the one he achieved under the Conservatives . Some also called for pacts with Ukip at next year’s general election and an early break-up of the coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Mr Farage was out celebrating until 4.45am with Douglas Carswell (left), the first Ukip MP who was elected yesterday after defecting from the Tories . The shock results raised further questions about Mr Miliband’s leadership of the Labour Party. Jack Straw said he should do a ‘lot more’ and take a stronger stance on immigration to win back traditional voters. Frank Field, another Labour ex-minister, warned the party’s core vote had been so neglected that even supposedly safe seats could be lost next May. On a day of extraordinary political drama: . Early yesterday, Mr Carswell, who defected from the Tories over the summer, became Ukip’s first elected MP, cruising to victory in Clacton, Essex, with nearly 60 per cent of the vote. His majority of 12,404 was higher than he achieved as a Tory in 2010, with the Conservatives in second on 8,709 votes, Labour in third and the Greens pushing the Lib Dems into fifth. In Heywood and Middleton, Labour suffered embarrassment when, after a recount, Ukip came within 617 votes of defeating its candidate Liz McInnes. Despite posing for pictures together, there were signs of an early rift between Farage and Carswell, after the Ukip leader called for people with HIV to be banned from entering the UK, and the new MP refused to back him . Mr Farage, who celebrated the results by staying out drinking until 4.45am, declared Ukip was now a national party. ‘We could find ourselves next May in a position where we hold the balance of power,’ he claimed. Mr Cameron said the general election would be the most important in a generation. ‘If you see a big Ukip vote, what you will end up with is Ed Miliband as PM, Ed Balls as Chancellor, Labour in power,’ the Prime Minister said. Mr Straw said his party had ‘to do a lot more’ to convince ordinary voters ‘that we’re on their side’. He added: ‘There’s also this critical issue of immigration.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, increasingly tipped as a replacement for Mr Miliband, insisted the results had not been a ‘disaster’ for Labour. Liz McInnes hailed yesterday's win in Heywood and Middleton as a victory for Ed Miliband's policies despite coming within 617 votes of defeat after Ukip asked for a recount . But he added: ‘There is more we need to do to listen to people who are voting Ukip, particularly on immigration. I can’t defend on the doorstep, and actually I haven’t tried, the sending back of benefits to people who come to work here. ‘It doesn’t meet most people’s test of basic fairness, you know, that you haven’t contributed but then you can take out.’ Veteran MP Sir Edward Leigh said Mr Cameron should collapse the coalition with the Lib Dems and set out clearer ‘red lines’ for a proposed renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU. A Populus poll last night put the Tories on 34 per cent, Labour on 35, Ukip on 13 and the Lib Dems up one on nine.","Cameron and Miliband left reeling after Ukip surge in by-elections yesterday .

Eight months on from storming the Bastille to deliver a rare Six Nations title, sorcerer Joe Schmidt produced another emphatic show of alchemy, conjuring up a magnificent blueprint to out-box the Boks and shake up the established world order 10 months out from the 2015 World Cup. On a day when England and Wales were swatted aside by the southern hemisphere giants they had welcomed into their lair, Schmidt’s Ireland showed their neighbours exactly what it takes to take out on of the touring big hitters – heart, relentless work-rate, canny tactics and ultimately some beautifully crafted tries. Swatting aside the build-up that had dominated by pessimism surrounding the injury situation and the limited training window, the fact of the matter was that Ireland were still resourced by a strong central spine of the side that secured Six Nations glory in Paris. Ireland players celebrate after Tommy Bowe's try during their 29-15 victory over South Africa at the Aviva Stadium . Fly half Jonathan Sexton of Ireland is tackled by centre Jan Serfontein of South Africa as he tries to escape with the ball . Ireland: R Kearney (F Jones, 74); T Bowe, J Payne (E Reddan, 79), R Henshaw, S Zebo; J Sexton (I Madigan, 74), C Murray; J McGrath (D Kilcoyne, 74), S Cronin (R Strauss, 59), M Ross (R Ah You, 74), D Toner (M McCarthy, 74), P O’Connell, P O’Mahony (T O’Donnell, 71), R Ruddock, J Heaslip. Tries: Ruddock, Bowe . Pens: Sexton (4), Madigan; Cons: Sexton (2). South Africa: W le Roux; C Hendricks (JP Pietersen, 50), J Serfontein, J de Villiers, B Habana; H Pollard (P Lambie, 67), F Hougaard (C Reinach, 57); T Mtawarira (T Nyakane, 67), B du Plessis (A Strauss, 51), J du Plessis C Oosthuizen, 71), E Etzebeth (B Botha, 65), V Matfield, M Coetzee (B du Plessis, 71-77), T Mohoje (S Burger, 47), D Vermeulen. Tries: Coetzee, Pietersen . Pen: Pollard; Con: Pollard. Yellows: Strauss 67'. And despite having their best laid plan hit late on by Chris Henry succumbing pre-match to a virus, an illness that handed Rhys Ruddock just his second Test start, the home side exhibited tremendous first-half defensive bottle, which put manners on South Africa’s feared physicality, and they then confidently hit their stride on the resumption to race to what ultimately was a comfortable margin of victory. As witnessed in 2009, when Jonathan Sexton, in only his second start, put the boot through South Africa at Croke Park, Ireland, in terms of growing their depth, has nothing to lose in gambling on the experimental midfield of Robbie Henshaw and Jared Payne and going in with two-thirds of a rejigged front row where Jack McGrath was making just his third start and Sean Cronin was finally starting his first Test since the 2011 World Cup. McGrath, at the scrum, and Cronin, with his throwing, endured some moments of anxiety during the tensely-fought first half, but there was never a feeling that they wouldn’t pull through this examination. Ruddock, too, equally grew into the contest, but special mention must go to Robbie Henshaw, the 21-year-old about whom so much was expected stepping into an Irish midfield no longer occupied by Brian O’Driscoll and Gordon D’Arcy. Having learnt his trade as provincial full-back last season before running the 13 channel in the opening few months this season, he had suddenly found himself shunted one positon further in in his first proper Test start. He readjusted to the role with savvy, as did new cap Jared Payne outside him, and their role in keeping Ireland’s defence solid during the win-creating opening half was vital. The opening narrative was how competitive Ireland were on the back foot in forcing a surfeit of turnovers, being efficient on rare attacks and ultimately being very good value for the 6-3 advantage they took with them into the interval, Sexton’s two penalties on nine and 24 minutes trumping one from Handré Pollard two minutes from the break.

South Africa's fly half Handre Pollard (second left) is tackled by Ireland's centre Jared Payne (left) during the first half . Ireland's Simon Zebo (centre) is tackled by South Africa's Francois Hougaard (front) in a ruck surrounded by several other players . However, Ireland really needed to stick it the man for belief to flow that this would indeed be their evening. This they did with chutzpah, Ruddock scoring the game-changing opening try just one minute and 45 seconds after the resumption. Tommy Bowe gambled intuitively. Gathering inside his own 22, he could have punted to touch and given the Boks a restarting lineout somewhere near halfway. However, without Test action since last November’s humdinger against New Zealand, the winger reminded us what he can by punting a contestable kick and then racing forward to cleanly fetch in the air. With that, Ireland probed left and Henshaw executed a lovely kick to the corner, follow-up pressure from the centre earning a lineout just metres out. Devin Toner fetched and Ruddock shunted though a gap in the maul to ground for the try converted by Sexton. South Africa’s quickly launch their bench, but initial attempts to curb Ireland’s 13-3 lead lacked accuracy due to continued well-drilled home defence.

Handed a kickable penalty, the Boks went for the corner and after Victor Matfield collected, Marcell Coetzee bounded over off the resulting maul. Pollard’s conversion reeled the margin to the three-point gap it had been at the break, but the visitors couldn’t build on this riposte, Duane Vermeulen going high on Jamie Heaslip six minutes later and Sexton punishing the offence with aplomb. Next, a great strip in the tackle by Henshaw put the skids on a Coetzee advance and when replacement Adriaan Strauss rashly collided with the aerial Rob Kearney, the Boks went a player down with their 67th minute yellow card. That set the stage for Ireland to close out just their fifth win in 22 attempts against South Africa. They probed excellently, their initial pay-off being a Sexton penalty four minutes later by Sexton after replacement prop Trevor Nyakane failed to heed ruck warnings from referee Romain Poite. That gloriously wasn’t all, though. Sexton exploded off scrum ball, bursting past another replacement, Pat Lambie, and from the ensuing ruck, Conor Murray’s vision was 20/20, his sublime box kick getting collected by Bowe for the try Sexton converted for a handsome 16-point lead. The Boks were busted, inviting Schmidt to clear his bench. Ian Madigan soon added a penalty and while JP Pietersen ran in an unconverted try, it couldn’t smudge the polish of this outstanding Irish ambush.

"A serial cheater who was married to two women at the same time will not be prosecuted for bigamy- even though his first wife reported him to the police. Tatiana Ochoa and Kenneth DeCesare tied the knot in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2011, two years after they spoke over the telephone in a job interview . After a rocky start to their marriage, where DeCesare would spend days away from home at a time, they decided to separate - but did not divorce. Scroll down for video . First wife: Tatiana Ochoa and Kenneth DeCesare tied the knot in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 2011. They separated after a rocky start to the relationship, but Miss Ochoa soon discovered he married someone else . Devastated: Miss Ochoa said there were no words that could hurt her as much when she found out DeCesare was married to another woman, so she decided to report the matter to the police . Months later Miss Ochoa was devastated when she found out he had wed another woman, even though they still were legally married. She told WKMG Local 6 that a friend found court documents proving DeCesare had married Alicia Fagan in September. He had been married to the two women at the same time for nine months. 'To hear that he married someone else, I don't think there are other words that a person could hear that could hurt as much,' she said. Miss Ochoa then reported DeCesare to the police, saying he had committed bigamy, a felony that carries a five year prison sentence. He even admitted the crime in a post on his blog called 'The Mistake of Ken DeCesare'. He wrote: 'On a drug binge, I did not realize what I was doing, but I actually married a woman while I was already married – Upon realizing what I had done, I immediately told her that I could not be with her & we dissolved the marriage (hence the technically having been married three times). 'In my own defense, most of these poor decisions were made under the influence of and/or in the pursuit of substance abuse – therefore incoherent. 'However, to me, that is no excuse for my personal failings. I lied to people. I took from others. I looked the other way while my employees misled clients. 'I cheated profusely in relationships. I offered financial payout to women in exchange for pleasure (never outright prostitution). Basically, I became a filthy & unrecognizable monster.' Miss Ochoa filed a complaint with the Orange County Sheriff's Office. In the incident report, Deputy Andrea Jacobsen wrote, 'Kenneth Moulton DeCesare has committed the crime of bigamy' and indicated a criminal charge would be filed with the state attorney's office. But before it was processed, Orange County authorities sent the complaint to the Osceola County Sheriff's Office, where DeCesare's second marriage occurred. Proceedings: Miss Ochoa (left) filed a complaint, but detectives found that DeCesare's (right) second wife, Alicia Fagan, was filing for divorce and did not want to prosecute, so they dropped the case . Osceola County sheriff's spokeswoman Twis Lizasuain said they initially investigated what had happened. However they soon discovered that DeCesare's second wife Alicia Fagan was in the process of divorcing him and did not want to participate in the investigation. Fagan told Local 6: 'He's dead to me, buried with a tombstone. I had no reason to suspect he was married.' Lizasuain added: 'The second wife, who would have been the victim, has declined to prosecute; therefore our detectives closed the case.' Under Florida law, the original marriage is the only valid one. Even though he has admitted to the crime online and authorities have received a complaint, bigamists in Florida are rarely prosecuted. Since 2000, only 14 defendants were prosecuted for bigamy in Orange, Brevard, Volusia and Lake Counties. Only one, Leonard Hare, was sentenced to prison, where he served 9 months. In response, DeCesare said he has now been admitted into a drug treatment program. In an earlier blog post he wrote: 'Being an entrepreneur is who I am. Being a good person is who I want to be.' Truth: DeCesare said he married the second woman during a 'drug binge' and has now been admitted into a drug treatment program. He admitted he had committed bigamy in a post on his blog .","Tatiana Ochoa and Kenneth DeCesare wed in Daytona Beach in 2011 .

"Tallahassee police are investigating Florida State University's starting running back in connection to a possible incident of domestic battery, the department said Monday in a press release. Senior Karlos Williams is the target of a probe by investigators over an incident reported to police Saturday night involving Williams's live-in girlfriend. ESPN reports that people close to the investigation have stated that the running back allegedly assaulted his girlfriend, who is pregnant with the couple's second child. Investigation: Karlos Williams, pictured with girlfriend Miranda Wilhelm, is under investigation by Tallahassee police for domestic violence . On Friday night, Williams's girlfriend Miranda Wilhelm posted photos on Facebook showing bruises on her arms, with a message saying, 'I am ready to speak up for women in situations [like] myself.' 'This was done to me 2 nights ago by a man I have lived with for two years,' the post continued. Jacksonville sports radio host Rick Ballou tweeted Friday morning that Williams had been suspended, though the university and team deny this. 'The athletics department is aware of an investigation by the Tallahassee Police Department involving football student-athlete Karlos Williams,' the school acknowledged in a statement. 'Until we receive more information regarding the alleged incident his status with the team will be under review,' the statement read. FSU head coach Jimbo Fisher told reporters Friday that the rumors of Williams being suspended were 'false.' Junior: Wilhelm and Williams have a son, Karlos Williams Jr, together and Wilhelm said she was pregnant in a Facebook post about the incident . Allegations: Wilhelm made a post on Facebook showing bruises on her arm, which she attributed to a 'man I have lived with for two years' Lead rusher: Williams currently leads FSU's depth chart in rushing, with 378 yards over 82 carries with 7 touchdowns . Under scrutiny: Jameis Winston, FSU's starting quarterback, has also attracted negative attention for disciplinary problems and is currently under investigation by the university . 'There's another false report, and that's amazing how things happen. Whoever has sources, whoever has rumors, needs to check who they are talking to — because that is about as far from truth as there is.' Fisher also called Williams a 'tremendous kid, a tremendous ambassador' while saying he did not know where the report could have come from. The Seminoles coach had similar praise for his  quarterback, Jameis Winston, who has been scrutinized for several disciplinary problems. 'Jameis is a tremendous person. He's a tremendous people person,' Fisher said during the L'Arche Mobile DEX Imaging Football Preview in Mobile, Alabama, back in May. 'When you're around him, you get his magnetic personality. He loves people. He loves fans. He's great with kids. He's a tremendous human being,' Fisher added. Winston was suspended for one game in September after he repeatedly screamed 'f--- her right in the p----' in the center of FSU campus. The outburst, a reference to an Internet meme, was considered by some to be in poor taste, as Winston is being investigated for allegations stemming from a reported sexual assault in 2012.","Karlos Williams, 21, is being investigated by police over reports of domestic battery against his live-in girlfriend .

"Attempting to move past her now infamous 'dead broke' gaffe, Hillary Clinton sought to empathize with low-income women on Friday at event in Washington by opening up about the difficulties she faced as a young mother more than 30 years ago. While making the case for Paid Family Leave and an increase in the federal minimum wage, Clinton recounted an instance when her usual babysitter cancelled on her and she had to find a last-minute replacement. 'I had many more advantages, much more support, and yet I too felt that squeeze,' she said, comparing her situation to that of other working mothers. Attempting to move past her now infamous 'dead broke' gaffe, Hillary Clinton sought to empathize with low-income women on Friday at event in Washington by opening up about the difficulties she faced as a young mother more than 30 years ago . Clinton, who is a presumed 2016 presidential candidate, has struggled to relate to average Americans throughout her political career. Even before her cringe-worthy comment earlier this summer about her financial woes, Clinton faced criticism for being too closed off and unapproachable.The former New York Senator's chilly demeanor has often been cited as a contributing factor to her 2008 loss in the Democratic presidential primary. Since leaving the Obama administration, Clinton has taken steps to soften her image ahead of a second, possible presidential campaign, embarking on a nationwide book tour earlier this summer and headlining an iconic steak fry fundraiser in Iowa last week. Clinton reportedly spent her summer vacation in the Hamptons asking friends for advice on how to talk about economic inequality. The former lawmaker appeared to try out her improved message in Washington, D.C. this week during two women's events sponsored by leading Democratic organizations. On Thursday Clinton participated in a roundtable discussion on the obstacles working women face that was held at the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank founded by Clinton White House alum John Podesta. This afternoon she appeared at the Democratic National Committee's annual Women's Leadership Forum. In her remarks at the Democratic Party event, Clinton said she was approached at the roundtable by a woman from Chicago who lost her job last winter because she was unable to obtain reliable childcare for her autistic son when the city's schools shut down due to bad weather. 'As I sat there listening to her story, I remembered how I felt as a young mother, so many years ago,' Clinton said. 'There was one morning when I was due in court at 9:30 for a trial. It was already 7:30, and Chelsea, just two years old, was running a fever and throwing up. 'My husband was out of town, the normal babysitter called in sick with the same symptoms, I had no relatives living nearby, my neighbors were not home, and so, frantic, I called a trusted friend who came to my rescue,' she recalled. 'Still I felt terrible that I had to leave my sick child at all. And I called back every break in the trial, and I rushed home as soon as court adjourned. 'When I opened the door and saw my friend reading to Chelsea ,who was clearly feeling better, my head and stomach stopped aching for the first time that day.' But for many parents, Clinton said, 'that ache is with them every single day.' 'The most vulnerable families in our country have the least support.' 'I had many more advantages, much more support, and yet I too felt that squeeze,' Clinton said, comparing her situation to that of other working mothers while speaking at the Democratic National Committee's annual Women's Leadership Forum in Washington, D.C. Women hold a majority of minimum wage jobs, she said, and 'without flexibility, or predictability, without access to quality affordable childcare, without paid family leave,' it's 'no wonder there were 5.1 million more women in poverty than men last year.' 'No wonder so many American families are hurting today,' she continued. 'For too many women for too many families, they don't just face ceilings on their dreams, it feels to them as though the floor has collapsed beneath their feet. 'That's not how its supposed to be in America. This is the country where if you work hard, you can make it.' Clinton has not officially announced her candidacy for president in 2016, and it's unclear if she'll actually enter the race. At last week's steak fry she acknowledged that that she was considering another campaign but left it at that. If she does run for president again, she's expected to breeze through the Democratic primary. In the general election, however, she could face stiff competition from several Republican politicians, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. Both are known for their compelling personal stories and ability to speak plainly to Americans.","While making the case for Paid Family Leave, Clinton opened up about the difficulties she faced as a young mother .

"The family of a baby girl who was mauled to death by their banned American pit bull paid the 'ultimate price' for owning a dangerous dog, an inquest has heard. The six-month-old baby, named today as Molly-Mae Wotherspoon, died from blood loss 12 days ago after sustaining severe head wounds in the fatal attack at her mother's home in Daventry . Today, senior coroner for Northamptonshire Anne Pember issued a stern warning about keeping dogs banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act, saying Molly-Mae's family had 'paid the ultimate price' for doing so. Claire Riley spoke out in 2012 about her 'absolutely crazy' Bull Terrier Pups, who she said wreaked £1,500 worth of damage in her home. Her six-month old daughter Molly-Mae Wotherspoon was mauled to death by the family's American pit bull earlier this month . Ms Riley said she 'hoped things would change' but that she had tried everything to calm her dog down. It is not known whether Pups is the dog which mauled Molly-Mae to death . She said: 'I understand the family owned the American pit bull terrier who attacked Molly-Mae. 'The public should be aware that this breed is classified under the Dangerous Dogs Act for a reason - its dangerousness. 'The family in this case have paid the ultimate price for owning such a dog - the death of their six-month-old baby.' Two years ago, Molly-Mae's mother Claire Riley spoke to MailOnline about one of her dogs, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, who she said was 'absolutely crazy'. She told how Pups wreaked £1,500 worth of damage at her home by destroying two laptops, a mobile phone, TV wires and even an armchair. She said she 'hoped things would change'. It is not known if Pups was the dog that attacked Ms Riley's daughter. Molly-Mae was attacked on Friday, October 3 while she was being looked after by her grandmother Susan, 54, at their three-bedroom house. Her grandmother - who was minding the child while Ms Riley popped out - also sustained injuries trying to fight off the dog. Two years ago, Ms Riley revealed how one of her dogs had caused havoc in her home by destroying her armchair (left) and sofa (right) and she could not leave it alone for more than 30 minutes . Officers and paramedics rushed to the scene, where they attempted to resuscitate the baby. Molly-Mae was taken to Northampton General Hospital where she was confirmed dead. The dog was put down at the scene. After the attack, Northamptonshire Police confirmed the dog was an American pit bull, a breed which has been banned in the UK since the early 90s. The family is understood to have owned two dogs, both said to be pit bulls. One neighbour called them 'devil dogs' because they were always barking and fighting each other. During her interview in 2012, Ms Riley told how her 11-month-old Staffie was so hyper that she was unable to leave her home for more than 30 minutes in case she started eating her valuables. She said at the time: 'She is absolutely crazy. Pups is the cutest thing ever when I'm around but if I even leave the room she goes nuts. The fatal attack took place in Daventry, in the home where the baby lived with her mother and grandmother, the inquest was told . 'She has destroyed my home. I have had to fit two new kitchen cupboard doors. It has cost me an absolute fortune, at least £1,500.' Ms Riley also told how she also spent £140 on a dog whisperer to see if he could stop Pups wrecking her home. But he told her the dog was beyond help. She added: 'Nothing works. He could not recommend any techniques. Hopefully age will slow her down. 'I just have to keep shouting at her and hope one day she will listen. It is hard work. I am housebound with her. 'I have come this far with her. I hand reared her with a bottle. I don't want to give up on her now. 'I'm still hoping things will change. Until then I just have to hide my laptop and phone and hope she grows out of it.' Molly-Mae was taken to Northampton General Hospital after sustaining severe head wounds but could not be saved . Friends said Ms Riley, who lived with her mother and daughter in the terraced house, was considering giving up her two dogs but kept them for protection. One said: 'I know she had called police to her house. You can still see the broken window.She promised me she'd get rid of the dogs. She said she'd give them to her brothers.' A couple that live on the same street say neighbours had reported the dogs to Daventry District Council on multiple occasions but nothing had been done. Daventry District Council said they were called to the property in May this year after receiving a complaint from a neighbour about the dogs. It said no further action was taken. In a statement released by police, the family said they were 'totally devastated' by what had happened. It said: 'The family wish to say at this point that we are totally devastated and in complete shock for the tragic loss of our little princess and ask that we are left alone to grieve at this horrific time.' Speaking at a press conference in Northampton after the girl's death, Chief Inspector Tom Thompson had said the victim's life had been 'tragically taken away in the most horrific of circumstances.' Neighbours lay floral tributes at the house, following the young girl's death . He said: 'The baby girl was confirmed dead shortly after the attack at her mother's home in Morning Star Road on the Timken estate. 'At the time of the attack, she was being cared for by her maternal grandmother who suffered bite injuries attempting to protect the baby. The dog was destroyed by vets at the scene. 'Subsequently a post-mortem was carried out at the Royal Veterinary College with the assistance of dog legislation officers from this force and elsewhere. 'This was done to determine the breed of the dog responsible for the fatal attack . 'We can reveal the outcome of that post mortem has shown the dog was an American pit bull, a prohibited breed under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act.' Mr Thompson had refused to be drawn on whether anyone had been arrested in connection with potential offences under the Dangerous Dogs Act, which makes it illegal to own, breed, sell or trade American pit bulls. The officer said: 'Extensive inquiries are taking place to ascertain if any offences have occurred. The incident took place in Morning Star Road on October 3.  Police have referred the circumstances of the death to a serious case review committee . 'This continues to be a complex and highly unusual investigation which has required significant resource within force and drawn on national expertise in the area of dangerous dogs. 'But at the heart of it is a baby girl whose life has tragically been taken away in the most horrific of circumstances. 'In addition to our ongoing investigation, we have been concentrating our efforts on providing support for a grieving family who have been left devastated by this. 'The family have made it very clear that they do not want us to name their child. We must remember that they're grieving, they're in shock. 'They have lost a child in the most tragic circumstances and we really must respect their wishes.' It is understood the force have dealt with 62 instances of attacks involving dogs in the past two years. Police have referred the circumstances of the death to a serious case review committee, which will meet next month to consider whether it should be investigated by Northamptonshire's Safeguarding Children Board. The tragedy has sparked calls for new, tougher rules to be put in place to prevent potentially dangerous dogs from being housed in family homes. Dog owners in Britain used to be required to have a licence but they were widely ignored and eventually abolished in 1987. New laws introduced in May can see owners of a dangerous dog jailed for up to 14 years if their pet gets past them. Also, the new laws enable police to prosecute the owners of dangerous dogs even if the attack happened in their own home. Since 2005, at least 20 people have died in dog attacks across Britain. The coroner adjourned the inquest until February 11 next year and released Molly-Mae's body to her family. Mrs Pember gave the provisional cause of Molly-Mae's death as exsanguination from injuries sustained in a dog attack. During the two-minute hearing at Northampton General Hospital, Coroner for Northamptonshire, Ms Pember said the baby's body had been identified by Molly-Mae's mother.","Baby mauled to death in Daventry named today as Molly-Mae Wotherspoon .

"A controversial photograph of a woman dressed in a burqa and holding a gun is believed to be Afghanistan's first female policewoman who was gunned down while fighting against Taliban extremists. The photograph was shared on Facebook by Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie in a campaign to 'ban the burqa' for security reasons after Australia experienced the largest counter-terrorism operation in the country's history on Thursday. Senator Lambie shared the image posted by far right British group Britain First in response to Senator Cory Bernardi's opposition to the full-length garb worn by some Islamic women. Scroll down for video . 'Ban the burqa': Senator Lambie shared this post on her public Facebook page on Thursday night . It is believed that the woman in the photograph, Malalai Kakar, was shot down in her car by the Taliban in 2008, the ABC reports. Lieutenant Colonel Kakar was a mother of six married to a United Nations worker and was recognised globally for protecting divorced Afghani women from their husbands. The photograph is featured in the 'Forsaken' exhibition that displays photos of Afghan women taken by Canadian photographer Lana Slezic. Ms Slezic, who took the photo in Lieutenant Colonel Kakar's office said she is 'deeply insulted' by the  way the image has been used. 'I'm shocked... I cannot believe how Malalai's image has been really desecrated on Jacqui Lambie's Facebook page. 'It's a misappropriation of Malalai Kakar's identity of her family. It's an insult to her family and her children and I'm appalled by the way it's been used really,' Ms Slezic said. According to the photographer the image was taken to depict Lieutenant Colonel Kakar's hardship as an officer working 'undercover'. She said the policewoman wore the burqa outside the police station but inside was dressed in uniform. Controversial words: Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie. Senator Lambie was told to 'get a life' after she echoed  Mr Bernardi's controversial remarks. The broadcaster quoted Ms Lambie saying: 'I agree whole-heartedly with Senator Cory Bernardi’s comments - and call for an immediate and complete ban on the wearing of burqas in public. 'People can do want they want in the privacy of their own homes – but for the public safety of our children and families – remove the burqa.' A spokesman for the conservative Australian Senator said she stood by her message but would review the image. Spray: Senator Lambie last week said people who believe in sharia law should 'get out' of Australia. Prominent Islamic community spokesman Keysar Trad told Daily Mail Australia Ms Lambie was 'jumping on the phobia bandwagon'. 'I think she should get out more,' Mr Trad said. 'She really seems to me like a misinformed person and should learn a bit more about her fellow Australians.' Senator Lambie's statements came after South Australian Liberal Senator Bernardi tweeted: 'Note burqa wearers in some of the houses raided this morning? This shroud of oppression and flag of fundamentalism is not right in Aust'. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who himself has said in the past he found the burqa 'confronting', distanced himself from Mr Bernardi's remarks. 'We shouldn't fret about people's faith. We shouldn't fret about what people wear. We should guard against crime. We should protect ourselves against potential terror,' he told reporters. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was scathing about Mr  Bernardi's burqa comments. 'Why on earth is this out-of-touch, out-of-line Senator on a rampage with his ignorant and stupid comments?' he said at a press conference in Canberra. Last week, Senator Lambie told reporters that people who support sharia law should 'get out' of Australia. A spokesman for Senator Lambie was unavailable for comment on Friday morning.","Woman in Jacqui Lambie's controversial photograph is believed to be Afghanistan's first female policewoman .

"Galen Hawk, 26, has pleaded not guilty to a negligent-homicide charge after shooting a three-year-old boy . A man who shot dead a three-year-old with a gun he pointed at the little boy but  did not think was loaded has pleaded not guilty to negligent homicide. Prosecutors allege Galen Hawk, 26, from Montana, had been drinking when he shot Lonato Moran-Allen in the back, after he saw the child holding his gun and took it away. Hawk told authorities he was playing with the boy at the child's home in home in Ninepipes. He said the boy ran away from him and then looked back while pretending to shoot a toy gun. In response, Hawk pointed his gun at the child and pulled the trigger, believing the weapon was not loaded because the magazine was in his pocket. Following the shooting, Hawk attempted to perform CPR on the boy before driving him to a hospital in Ronan where he later died, just weeks before his fourth birthday. Hawk told investigators he had been drinking whiskey and alcoholic lemonade during the evening prior to the shooting. He entered the not guilty plea to a negligent homicide charge and District Judge James Manley set a March 2 trial date. If convicted, Hawk faces up to 20 years in prison. He remains jailed on $100,000 bail. Lonato Moran-Allen was shot in the back and died just weeks before his fourth birthday . According to KBZK, Hawk's defense attorney Matt Pavelich previously attempted to reduce his  bail, arguing that he is not a threat to the community. He said: 'I don't see Mr Hawk as a threat to run, with respect to any danger that he represents to the community. 'I believe that could be curtailed by the imposition of 24-7 alcohol monitoring.' Deputy Lake County Attorney James Lapotka disagreed. He showed a weapon in court similar to the one used by Hawk. 'He chose to take a handgun, similar to this one, a 380 handgun, loaded, while he was intoxicated and pointed it at a child, and discharged that firearm, ' Mr Lapotka said. KBZK also reported that Lonato was in the custody of a woman who was at the home at the time of the shooting, but she told investigators that she was unaware of any guns being in the house.","Galen Hawk, 26, from Montana, shot Lonato Moran-Allen in the back .

"First former President Bill Clinton called him 'Bill' at an influential gathering of Democrats. Then Michelle Obama repeatedly botched his last name at an endorsement rally. She also confused him with his marine corps veteran father. Last week the White House misidentified the elected office he is seeking in an email to reporters. Other politicians may have been offended by such high-profile flubs, but Iowa Rep. Bruce Braley, a Democrat candidate for the U.S. Senate, told MailOnline Sunday he's not offended that his prominent backers can't seem to get his personal details straight. 'Everyone makes mistakes,' he said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Friends again: First lady Michelle Obama gets a hug from Iowa Senate candidate Bruce Braley during a campaign in Iowa City, Iowa, last week. Obama came back to Iowa to stump for Braley for the second time this month after a disastrous first appearance at which she repeatedly called him by the wrong name . Braley, left, shakes hands with a voter after casting his ballot in the U.S. Senate race on Friday. Braley spent the weekend barnstorming the state, trying to visit as many of Iowa's 99 counties as possible before the polls close . The Iowa lawmaker explained that he's no stranger to having people mix up his last name. A local newspaper misidentified the last name of two of his three children, Lisa, David and Paul, in their birth announcements, he said. 'One of them was listed as Barley. One of them was listed as Bradley,' he revealed. 'These are honest mistakes that people make. 'What's more important is that people have been coming to Iowa to help to inspire Iowa voters to understand why this election is important,' he continued. Braley pointed out that the first lady made jokes at her own expense about the gaffe when she returned to Iowa to stump for him last week. 'And you know what, Iowans are understanding and forgiving because everyone makes mistakes,' he said of the incident. Braley, a four-term congressman, is competing against Iowa state senator Joni Ernst for the Hawkeye state's open Senate seat. Their race is one of a handful that will determine whether Republicans gain control of the legislative branch next year. Ernst has beat out Braley  in all but two surveys taken of Iowa voters in the last month. In both instances, the lawmakers tied. Polling site Real Clear Politics continues to rank the competition as one in which either candidate could claim victory as Ernst's lead has always been within the margin of error. With just nine days to go until the midterm elections, both candidates spent the better part of their Sunday rushing around the state, trying to  visit with voters in all 99 of Iowa's counties. Ernst began her day with an early morning pancake breakfast in her home town, Red Oak, a small town located in the southwestern part of the state. Braley's first public event was a meet-and-greet with canvassers in a suburb of Des Moines. There he thanked them for their support and emphasized the importance of replacing retiring Sen. Tom Harkin with a politician who will carry on the Democratic lawmaker's legacy. Notably absent from his stump speech was a call to action to support the embattled Democratic Party leader, President Barack Obama, by voting for himself and other Iowa Democrats. Still, the GOP has played up the Democratic candidate's ties to President Barack Obama. A video released by the state's Republican Party last week asked voters to 'send Barack Obama a message' by voting 'no on his handpicked candidate Bruce Braley.' Ernst has not bet the farm on the anti-Obama strategy like Republican hopefuls in other states have, however. While she has hit Braley on his vote for Obamacare and his support for the president's other 'failed policies' that she says have driven up the national debt, the conservative's message has largely focused on her own qualifications. She has attracted positive attention with quirky ads highlighting her background in agriculture, the state's most important industry. Standing in a pig sty, the Republican said in a March commercial, 'I'm Joni Ernst. I grew up castrating pigs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington, I'll know how to cut pork.' The video went viral on the web and propelled her to victory in the Republican primary for the Senate. It also put her and the Iowa Senate race, which was initially considered a lock for Braley, on the map. In a sequel ad released last week Ernst revisited the hog theme and compared Congress to a bunch of pigs. 'It's a mess. Dirty, noisy, and it stinks. Not this lot, I'm talking about the one in Washington,' the state legislator says as she's surrounded by pigs. 'Too many politicians, hogging, wasting, and full of... well let's just say, bad ideas,' Ernst adds as the camera pans to an oinking pig covered in manure. While the ads have by and large received positive attention, Ernst's detractors have lodged complaints that they are not specific enough, and Iowa Democrats have claimed that she would support a radical Tea Party agenda if elected. Ernst hit back at her critics on Sunday in an interview with MailOnline. 'I would not say they're lacking in substance because the overall goals, cut spending, repeal and replace Obamacare, those are pretty good goals to have.' Furthermore, she said, 'you can't...lay out in a 30-second ad really what, what your achievements would be in a United States Senate seat.' Ernst argued that the ads have served their intended purpose. 'So many people are relating to those ads,' she said. 'The hogs that we've had in the ads, very creative but fun, but it's agriculture,' she said. 'And so many people have come up to me and they've said, ""You know Joni, I used to do that when I was a kid, too."" 'You know, it's just part of growing up on a farm in an ag area,' she said of hog castration. Ernst has also made her military service a focal point of her campaign and has used it as a cudgel against her opponent, who did not serve in the armed forces. The Iraq veteran and National Guard member reminded friends and family this morning that she was one of those boots on ground in Iraq. 'So I understand what's going in that region of the world,' she told the 50 or so attendees of the Sunday am event. 'And understanding our military affairs is something that is extremely important at a time like today, when we are seeing crises in Iraq, Ukraine and Russia, in Iran, in Israel. 'There are so many areas that you have mentioned. Yet we have Congressman Braley and Barack Obama, they are reactive rather than proactive, she argued. 'So I believe that we need someone that has served her country, her community and her state serving in the United States Senate.' New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, right, greets Joni Ernst, the Republican nominee from Iowa to the U.S. Senate, at a birthday bash fundraiser for Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad on Saturday night.  Iowa has become a popular place for for Republicans and Democrats thinking about running for president to cut their teeth this year because of the competitive federal election . Ernst did not link her opponent to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  today, but her campaign has insinuated in the past that Braley is also in the pocket of the high-ranking Democrat. 'For Bruce Braley it has become a game of ""you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours,"" which is dangerous for Iowans given that radical groups like Harry Reid’s Senate Majority PAC, the American Association for Justice and the Texas Trial Lawyers Association are bankrolling his candidacy,' Ernst's spokeswoman, Gretchen Hamel, said in a statement posted on the campaign's website. 'If elected to the Senate, Bruce Braley will continue to be beholden to these extreme groups – meaning continued support of cap-and-trade, higher taxes, ObamaCare, and other job-killing legislation that will hurt Iowans…just so he can please his out-of-state liberal backers,' Hamel accused. Braley brushed off the suggestion that he would be a rubber stamp for President Obama and Majority Leader Reid's agenda if elected to office when he spoke with MailOnline over the weekend. 'All they [Ernst and her campaign] have to do is look at how I have taken on the president on issue after issue, including the renewable fuel standard,' he shot back. If anyone is being deceitful in this race, it's Ernst, he told reporters. A key facet of his message in the final days of the campaign, he said, will be: 'What's Joni Ernst trying to hide?' 'She's trying to hide that she's not on your side if you're in Iowa on issues like raising the minimum wage, protecting and preserving Social Security and Medicare, making college affordable, making sure that employers aren't rewarded for outsourcing jobs,' he claimed. 'I stand with Iowans, and I've made that very clear in all of the editorial board meetings I've gone to, in all of the interview I've done, just like this, in our three debates,' he said, taking a jab at Ernst's refusal to sit down with The Des Moines Register until it apologizes for statements its made about the campaign that she believes are unsavory. 'There are stark choices in this election,' Braley concluded. 'And that's what we're trying to get across to Iowans as we travel through the state.'","'What's more important,' he told MailOnline, 'is that people have been coming to Iowa to help to inspire' Iowans to vote .

"This is the hilarious moment a police officer ran straight into a wall after getting distracted as dozens of topless Femen activists sprinted past him. He appears to trip over his own feet while trying to stop the feminist protesters running through the streets near the Palace of Justice in Paris.

Zhdanova was given a fine of 1,500 euros - £1,182 - by the Parisian court for destroying Russian President Vladimir Putin's wax statue at the Grevin museum in June. The leader of the topless feminist group, Inna Schevchenko, was among the protesters and she was seen being carried away by police.

"It once formed an imposing, 90-mile-long concrete barrier that ran through the heart of Berlin. But 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, little remains in Germany of the historic structure. The Wall, which divided West Berlin from the communist East after it was built in 1961, was the most potent symbol of the Cold War. Scroll down for video . A piece of the Berlin Wall is seen at a garden inside San Martin palace, headquarters of Argentina's Foreign Ministry in Buenos Aires . It was constructed soon after Germany was divided up between the occupying powers of the US, the UK, France and the Soviet Union following the end of the Second World War. At least 136 people were killed along the heavily guarded wall during the 28 years that it was in existence, many of them attempting to flee the East. Since demolition of the Wall began on November 9, 1989, many sections have been auctioned off or sold as souvenirs, while large segments have been lost forever having been crushed and  used to build highways across the Germany. However, large parts were sold as art objects and donated to museums around the world, such as the Imperial War Museum in London and Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. Over the last 25 years, other sections ended up in even more surprising locations, such as the Main Street Station Casino, Brewery and Hotel in Las Vegas. A segment of the Berlin Wall is seen at the Foreign Ministry in San Jose, California . Ten segments of the Berlin Wall, which constitute the longest stretch outside of Berlin, are seen on display in Los Angeles, California . A section of the Berlin Wall painted with a mural of Olympic champion Usain Bolt, at the Jamaica Military Museum  in Kingston. The 12-foot section of the wall was given to Bolt in 2009 by the city of Berlin after the runner broke world records in the 100 and 200 metre finals of the World Athletics Championship in the city . People walk past a segment of the former Berlin Wall at Potsdamer Platz square in Berlin . The venue has installed the relic in the men's bathroom, with three urinals mounted onto the graffiti-covered concrete slab, which stands approximately three meters wide and 1.8 meters tall. The wall itself is protected by glass, and female visitors can request to observe the monument with the aid of a security guard. According to a book published by a German government agency earlier this year, a total of 240 segments of the wall are scattered across the globe, with more than a third of them ending up in the United States. A row of Berlin Wall segments can be found in the lobby of the Argentinian news company Perfil Group in Buenos Aires. The Perfil Group bought a total of 20 Berlin Wall segments in 1991, revealing that it bought the artefacts as a symbol of freedom.

Segments of the Berlin Wall, which are for sale, are seen at a storage yard in Teltow, south of Berlin . The firm’s website stated that it is ‘true to the spirit of a news company who exercises the right of freedom.’ The small village of Schengen in southeast Luxembourg installed a segment of the Wall in 2010 order to celebrate its place in European history. The Schengen Agreement, which heralded the start of a ‘borderless Europe’ was signed here in 1985 by five of the then ten member states of the European Economic Community to grant citizens free travel without border checks. The Wall segment was erected to mark the 20th anniversary of the agreement. Meanwhile Los Angeles is home to the longest section of Berlin Wall in the United States. Ten segments of the historic structure currently stand in front of the Variety Building on Wilshire Boulevard. Murals on four segments of the Wall are original works from the Berlin Wall-era, including a green bear painted by a street artist known as Bimer. A woman takes a photograph of her husband in front of part of the Berlin Wall at Berlin Square in Seoul . A segment of the Berlin Wall, which was painted by French-born, Berlin-based artist Thierry Noir, is pictured at The Wende Museum and Archive of the Cold War in Culver City, California . A woman walks past a piece of the Berlin Wall, which was from Potsdamer Platz, in a park outside the European Parliament in Brussels . The Wende Museum in Los Angeles, a research and education institute that preserves Cold War artefacts and history, brought these segments to Wilshire Boulevard in 2009 to ‘commemorate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and continue the legacy of the Berlin Wall as a concrete canvas for art and political expression.’ The Hilton Anatole Hotel in Dallas has installed two segments of the Wall as part of their renowned art collection. The 3.6m-high sections were given to the hotel by a German partner in 1990 and initially placed in the hotel's garden before being moved into the hotel's Trinity Corridor in 2011.

The longest surviving stretch of the wall is situated at the East Side Gallery in Berlin. It runs for around 1.3km . A chunk of the Berlin Wall was also placed in Vatican City in August 1994. The Wall has been decorated with a painting of St. Michael's Church. It is understood to have been given as a gift to the Vatican in 1994 by former Ferrari motor sport director and team manager of its Formula 1 team, Marco Piccinini, who won the portion at an auction in Monte Carlo in 1990. It was after the reunification of the East and West Germany that 65 cranes, 175 trucks and 13 bulldozers were ordered to remove the barrier in the inner city by the end of 1990.

"Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly who won a landmark ageism case against the BBC has attacked the corporation saying John Simpson has been given a new indefinite contract 'because he's man'. The 57-year-old, who successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination after she was dismissed from the programme, hit out on Twitter after learning of the new contract awarded to the broadcaster's world affairs editor. The 70-year-old journalist, who has worked for the BBC for more than 45 years, has been given the new deal that will see him work for the corporation for as long as he likes. Scroll down for video . Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly, left, who has attacked the BBC for giving world affairs editor John Simpson, right, an indefinite contract because 'he's a man' In an exchange on Twitter, Channel Five News correspondent Julian Druker sent a post to Miss Reilly with a link to a story about Mr Simpson, with the question 'Wonder what @OReillyMiriam thinks' And just three minutes later, Miss Reilly replied simply saying: 'He's a man.' Mr Druker then followed up with: 'I hope you've double-sourced this Miriam', to which she replied saying, 'Yes, I think you'll find that's accurate.' On Twitter, Miss O'Reilly was asked what she thought about Mr Simpson's new contract, to which she simply replied: 'He's man' A spokeswoman for the BBC refused to comment saying they do not discuss staff contracts. Miss O'Reilly was 51 when she was told in November 2008 that she was being dropped from Countryfile after eight years of co-presenting the Sunday lunchtime show. She then took the BBC to an employment tribunal and successfully sued them for age discrimination saying she had been devastated when she was told she would no longer be on the show. When asked if she had 'double-sourced' her information, she said 'Yes, I think you'll find that's accurate' The programme relaunched in April the following year in a Sunday prime-time slot with Julia Bradbury, 43 and Matt Baker 33, along with long-serving host 70-year-old John Craven. In the wake of her victory, Miss O’Reilly was given a three-year deal to return to the corporation. But in 2012 she announced she was leaving to launch a support service for women facing discrimination in the workplace. Her Twitter bio now states: 'Journalist. Writer. Campaigner. Fought ageism at the BBC and won.' Earlier this year, Miss O'Reilly also hit out on Twitter at her Countryfile replacement Miss Bradbury after she disputed that the 57-year-old had been a victim of age discrimination on the show. Miss O'Reilly was dropped from Countryfile in 2008 before it was relaunched in 2009 with Matt Baker, Julia Bradbury and John Craven, pictured . In an interview Miss Bradbury said that Miss O’Reilly’s departure from Countryfile in 2009 was simply a result of planned changes to the show’s format rather than discrimination. But in a series of tweets, Miss O'Reilly wrote: ‘So you know better than three judges in a legal case and former BBC DG [director general] Mark Thompson who accepted the tribunal decision? ‘Before you make ill-informed statements I suggest you look at the legal case – one day you might need it. Until then good luck with the a**e licking.’ Miss Bradbury did not respond to any of the tweets. Miss O’Reilly then told the Daily Mail she believed Miss Bradbury was simply voicing the defiance of senior producers on Countryfile, whom she claims have refused to accept the employment tribunal’s 2011 ruling.","Ex-Countryfile presenter was asked on Twitter about Mr Simpson's contract .

"A four-wheel drive has collided with a freight train, causing it to be dragged along the train tracks for more than a kilometre. A 23-year-old man driving a four-wheel drive was following a friend through bushland as they both tried to cross the Adelaide to Darwin rail line, 315 kilometres south of Darwin, in the Northern Territory at 1am on Sunday. The area that the young men drove over was a 'non-designated crossing', according to Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen. A four-wheel drive has collided with a freight train, causing it to be dragged along the train tracks for more than a kilometre . 'One car has made it across, but the vehicle driven by the 23-year-old has become stuck on the tracks,' Superintendent Jorgensen told ABC. 'The men attempted to free the vehicle but were unable to do so.' Despite both men trying to get the attention of the train driver by shining torches and waving, the kilometre-long freight, which was carrying manganese to Darwin, could not slow down in time and hit the four-wheel drive. The vehicle was pulled under the locomotive before hanging over the Katherine rail bridge. Thankfully both men were able to jump from the vehicle, leaving them uninjured. Superintendent Jorgensen said the train driver suffered from shock and was taken to Katherine Hospital. He was released at 6am. 'It's happened before, people trying to cross at non-designated crossings, which people should never do,' Superintendent Jorgensen said. Superintendent Jorgensen has confirmed no alcohol was involved. Both men are reportedly from Katherine, Northern Territory, and are expected to be charged over the dangerous incident . Greg Pauline, the train operator Genesee and Wyoming general manager said the accident has upset him greatly. 'These young idiots could have killed themselves or my crew,' he said. The incident caused a delay for the train, which was carrying groceries to Darwin, behind the freight train. 'It shouldn't affect our network too much,' he said. According to Mr Pauline, the four-wheel drive was uninsured. Both men are reportedly from Katherine, Northern Territory, and are expected to be charged over the dangerous incident.","Two men in 4WDs attempted to cross a 'non-designated crossing' on Adelaide to Darwin rail line .

Dutch daredevil Wim Hof, known as the 'iceman', led a group of 26 people to the summit of the world's highest free standing mountain - Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. In just 48 hours the group climbed all 5,895m (19, 340ft) without succumbing to hypothermia or altitude sickness - an achievement considered impossible by experts. Clearly, they were in peak condition. Wim Hof (right) led a group of climbers to the peak of Mount Kilimajaro in Tanzania - wearing just their shorts . Eleven of the team climbed the mountain dressed just in shorts and without tops - to arrive unhurt at the mountain's peak, where the temperature is a brutal -20C. Before the project started, the Dutch Mountaineering and Climbing Federation and expedition medics considered this impossible. The success rate of reaching Uhuru Peak in a regular mountaineering expedition is 41 per cent. Kilimanjaro is the world's highest free-standing mountain at 5895m . Hardy: The scantily clad climbers during the long trek to the top . At the summit the amount of oxygen is less than 50 per cent of the amount of oxygen at sea level - usually for a climber going up, it takes five to seven days to acclimatise. Altitude sickness can occur from 3000m upwards and usually starts with headaches, dizziness and confusion. In extreme cases cerebral edema - brain swelling - and even death may occur. Whim believes a combination of training focus, breathing and training at low temperatures made it possible for the participants to gain control over altitude sickness. Wim Hof shows off his muscle power during the trek to the top of the Tanzanian mountain . The participants of this expedition, aged between 29 and 65 years, were without any real mountaineering experience and some suffered conditions such as rheumatism, asthma and chrones disease. Wim Hof, who sat in an ice bath for one hour 13 minutes to break the world record, said: ‘Until now the world thought that only I was capable to conquer extreme cold and altitude. ‘These heroes have shown that everybody is able to do what I am doing. Peak condition: Wim Hof at the top with his signature pose . Climbers at a pit stop on the way to the snowy summit . The mountain is one of the most famous natural landmarks in the world . ‘My method offers people the possibility to influence their mind and body, and in particular their nervous system. ‘In the course of time people forgot how much they are able to do with their own bodies, and they have become dependent of pills and powders. ‘I want to show the world that they do not always need those and can do much more themselves. ‘The general opinion about altitude sickness has always been that it could not be prevented, not even with medication. If people can control this disease on their own, what else could be possible?’ Mr Hof claims that he can alter his body's heat using just the power of his mind.","A group of 26 were led to the summit by Dutch daredevil Wim Hof .

"American supermodel Kendra Spears, who is married to Prince Rahim Aga Khan lived her own real-life fairy-tale. And now just like Kate and William, this royal couple will be adding to their family as they announce they are expecting their first child. On the website for Nizari Ismailism, of which Prince Rahim Aga Khan is Imam, his father, Aga Khan IV, Mawlana Hazar Imam, posted the statement: . Scroll down for video . Kendra Spears and Prince Rahim Aga Khan, pictured on their wedding day, are expecting their first child . The couple made the announcement on the official Ismaili website on Friday . American supermodel Kendra Spears earned her title, Princess Salwa Aga Khan, when she married the eldest son of billionaire racehorse owner, His Highness Aga Khan IV, in 2013 . 'Expressing his greatest happiness, Mawlana Hazar Imam informed the Jamat today that Prince Rahim and Princess Salwa are expecting their first child. Around the world, Ismailis are gathering in Jamatkhanas to celebrate the happy news.' The 25-year-old earned her royal title when she married Prince Rahim Aga Khan, 42, the eldest son of billionaire racehorse owner, His Highness Aga Khan IV, last September. Prince Rahim studied in the U.S. at Brown University and the Navarra Business School in Barcelona, Spain and is involved in the poverty reduction efforts of the Aga Khan Development Network. His father, the Aga Khan, a British national, is the 49th hereditary Imam of Ismaili Shi'as, and is regarded by his followers as a direct bloodline descendant of the prophet Mohamed. After an engagement of only four months, Kendra and Prince Rahim exchanged vows at the Bellerive Castle in Geneva, Switzerland. Hailed as the 'next Cindy Crawford,' Spears has an impressive modelling resume as well as a B.A. in sociology from the University of Washington . Kendra, pictured on a shoot in Miami, landed a contract with Ford Models and made her debut at New York Fashion Week in September 2008 . Kendra has walked for Calvin Klein, Chanel, Lanvin, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy, among many others . The Seattle-born beauty, who was 24 at the time, wore a stunning ivory sari with gold embroidery to marry her husband in a traditional Muslim ceremony. Although styled 'Prince' or 'Princess', the Aga Khan is actually a religious leader and the imam of a Shi'a sect known as Imami Ismā'īlī Tariqah or Nizari Ismailism. Currently held by Prince Shah Karim Al Husseini Aga Khan IV, the title has been used since 1818 and was first bestowed by Persian (now Iran) ruler Fath-Ali Shah Qajar on Hasan Ali Shah, the 46th Iman of the Nizari Ismailis. Like the role of Imam to the Nizari Ismailis, the title is passed from father to son through a family which is are claimed to be directly descended from the Prophet Mohammed's cousin and son-in-law, Ali. The current Aga Khan is Prince Shah Karim Al Hussaini Aga Khan (IV), a British business magnate and racehorse breeder, who took the title at 20 after the death of his grandfather Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah Aga Khan III. He is considered one of the world's wealthiest people with a fortune in excess of $800m, part of which comes from a tithe paid by Ismaili Muslims called a 'dasond' - the equivalent of 12.5 percent of each person's gross annual income. News of the pregnancy comes just over a year after the wedding, and marks the continuation of the long royal line. The statement on the official website also states: 'Aitmadi Mahmoud Eboo, Chairman of the Ismaili Leaders' International Forum, has submitted a message of congratulations to Mawlana Hazar Imam and the entire Imamat family, and also conveyed warmest wishes to Prince Rahim and Princess Salwa on this very happy occasion.' The union of Kendra and Prince Rahim, reportedly worth around $800m, was the culmination of a fairytale story for the Seattle-born beauty, who rapidly rose to fame after winning an online modelling contest. Hailed as the 'next Cindy Crawford,' Spears has an impressive modelling resume - in fact, she and Prince Rahim were reportedly introduced by fellow supermodel Naomi Campbell. But this beauty has brains too - she obtained a B.A. in sociology from the University of Washington. It was only after graduating that she was discovered via MySpace by Ford Models. She landed a contract with Ford Models and made her debut at New York Fashion Week in September 2008. Her career lifted off in 2009, when she appeared on the covers of French ELLE, Chinese Vogue, and Dazed & Confused. She has also appeared in campaigns for Diane von Furstenberg and Prada and walked for Calvin Klein, Chanel, Lanvin, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy, among many others.","Kendra Spears and Prince Rahim Aga Khan expecting first child .

"Five British jihadis killed by US air strikes may have been trainee al-Qaeda suicide bombers, according to intelligence agencies. Those killed include 19-year-old Ibrahim Kamara, who quit his studies in Brighton to join militants in Syria. It’s thought that they were fighting for the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front. Kamara ‘met the wrong people’ and was quickly radicalised. He is said to have recently vowed to a fellow fighter he would never return to Britain . This wasn’t targeted by coalition planes, but a cell called Khorasan - hand-picked by Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and thought to be on the brink of attempting to blow up Western civilian airlines - was bombed. Counter-terrorism police think that the two groups may have been working alongside each other and that the Britons were being drilled by Khorasan  to carry out suicide attacks on Western targets, according to The Times. Kamara’s mother, Khadijah, 35, said that he had secretly travelled to the war-torn country and she felt ‘numb’ that he was dead. The teenager, who called himself Khalil al-Britani, had recently completed a resit of his GCSEs at Varndean College in Brighton. His single mother and her three other sons, who live in the Sussex city, are believed to be refugees from Sierra Leone who came to Britain via the Netherlands. Ibrahim Kamara, also known as Khalil al-Britani, from Brighton, was reportedly killed in U.S. air strikes . His single mother, Khadijah Kamara, and her three other sons, who live in Brighton, are believed to be refugees from Sierra Leone who came to Britain via the Netherlands . But football-loving Kamara ‘met the wrong people’ and was quickly radicalised. He is said to have recently vowed to a fellow fighter he would never return to Britain. Mrs Kamara, who says she abhors violence, said she knew her son was likely to die when he rang her and confessed he was in Syria. She said: ‘He called me in February. He said: “Mum, I’m in Syria”, and I hung up. He rang again and I said: “Don’t ever call me.” The first we heard about his death was when my younger son got a Facebook message from one of the boys he went out there with. ‘He sent a photo of Ibrahim dead and the message read “Congratulations, your brother has become a martyr”. My son told him to delete the picture but he refused.’ Mrs Kamara, manager of the Strive In The Way of Allah charity shop in Brighton, said of the 19-year-old: ‘He was a normal respectful boy. He had friends at school. He was studying IT and wanted to become an engineer. ‘He moved out recently but he had the spare key to my house and came round for dinner all the time. ‘I had no idea what he was planning. He must have been brainwashed. He went out there with three brothers from Brighton. ‘His passport was expired so he went up into my room and got the passport of his 15-year-old brother. It makes me wonder about the Border Control people because they look nothing like each other.’ The Foreign Office said it was aware of the reports of the dead Britons but could not confirm them at this stage.","Those killed include Ibrahim Kamara, 19, who quit studies to join militants .

"Thousands of men and women who regularly drink just three glasses of wine a day could be given a £3 pill to help them cut back under NHS guidelines. They urge GPs to prescribe the drug nalmefene to up to 600,000 adults in England deemed to be mild alcoholics. Many may not even consider themselves heavy drinkers and simply look forward to a few glasses of wine at evenings and weekends. Scroll down for video . GPs are being urged to prescribe the £3 pill namalfene to 600,000 'mild alcoholics' who drink three glasses of wine or more a day, under new guidelines from health watchdog NICE . But guidelines from the watchdog NICE says that women who drink more than two glasses of wine a day and men over four pints could be eligible. The NHS’s safe drinking limits are 2 to 3 units a day for women and 3 to 4 for men - there are just over two units in a medium glass of wine or pint of beer. Women who drink five units a day and men seven and a half - and who struggle to get by without it - could be offered the pill. Over the last decade deaths from liver disease have soared by a fifth and there were 4,425 in 2012 – mostly in the middle age. Alcohol is also known to increase the risk of many cancers and it also raises the blood pressure which can cause stroke and heart disease. The pill works by reducing the amount of the chemical dopamine released by the brain, which is responsible for the reward or ‘buzz’ feeling. It enables adults to enjoy one or two drinks and then stop without needing more. For this reason it would mean they wouldn’t have to go tee-total but could continue drinking socially at far lower levels. It would enable adults to have one drink socially but then stop without needing more and more. The guidance - which is provisional – tells doctors to prescribe the pill for a maximum of six months alongside counselling sessions such as with Alcoholics Anonymous. If all were to take the pill – on average every other day when they needed – for six months it would cost more than £150 million. By comparison, the NHS spends an estimated £3.5 billion annually treating patients for alcohol misuse. Andrew Langford, Chief Executive of the British Liver Trust, said: ‘The range of people who put themselves at risk through their drinking is quite wide. Namalfene  would enable adults to enjoy one or two drinks and then stop without needing more . ‘Some have not yet experienced social problems and are functioning well until they develop an alcohol-related physical illness such as high blood pressure, cancer or liver disease; while others lose their social supports and then tend to fit the stereotype of the ‘alcoholic’. ‘Reducing alcohol consumption can prevent these social and physical damages developing.’ Professor Jonathan Chick, Consultant Psychiatrist at Queen Margaret University Hospital Edinburgh, who specialises in alcohol dependence said: ‘Although for many people dependent on alcohol, abstinence is the preferred and optimal goal, nalmefene represents an alternative step, helping people to cut down drinking to less harmful levels when they are not ready and have no medical need to give up alcohol altogether.’ GPs are told to identify heavy drinker patients through a series of questions during routine appointments or when they first register with a practice. The NHS’s safe drinking limits are 2 to 3 units a day for women and 3 to 4 for men - there are just over two units in a medium glass of wine or pint of beer . These include how many units to you drink in a typical week and how often do you go over the recommended safe units of 2 to 3 for a woman 3 to 4 for a man. Doctors are also encouraged to look out for warning signs of heavy drinking such as a high blood pressure, insomnia, feeling low and a ruddy complexion. Trials involving 700 patients have found that taking the pill for six months reduced the average alcohol consumption from nine units to three units a day. The number of days patients drank heavily more than halved from 18 days a month to just eight. Professor Carole Longson, NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre Director, said: ‘Alcohol dependence is a serious issue for many people. ‘Those who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor, engaging with support services and taking part in therapy programmes. ‘We are pleased to be able to recommend the use of namelfene to support people further in their efforts to fight alcohol dependence . ‘When used alongside psychosocial support nalmefene is clinically and cost effective for the NHS compared with psychosocial support alone.’ NICE recommends that the drug is prescribed for a maximum of six months after which it is hoped patients would have cut back on their drinking with the additional help of counselling. It can cause unpleasant side effects such as sickness, dizziness, headaches and sleeping problems. Jackie Ballard, Chief Executive of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘It is important that there is a variety of treatments available to support people who want help with their alcohol dependency. ‘The introduction of nalmefene will be a useful addition to the clinician’s toolbox, when used in conjunction with other treatment methods to tackle the harmful consequences of alcohol misuse.’","New guidelines from health watchdog NICE recommend drug nalmafene .

"The Sopranos six season run may be over but's its memory is still very much alive in the funeral home featured on numerous episodes of the popular HBO drama. The Irvine-Cozzarelli Memorial Home in which Tony Soprano attended his mother's funeral is for sale for $1.8 million and is listed by Sroka Worldwide Team at Douglas Elliman. The 8,800+ sq. ft. property in Bellevue, New Jersey includes two kitchens, a freight elevator, and a two-story 10 car garage. Scroll down for video . Saying goodbye: Those who remember Tony Soprano saying goodbye to friends and family on The Sopranos can say hello to the Irvine-Cozzarelli Memorial Home which is on sale for 1.8 million. Ornate: The decorated space can function as more than just a funeral home and has many rooms . HBO hit: The Sopranos ran for six seasons on HBO and sadly the show's star James Gandolfini who plays Tony Soprano (center) died last year . The luxurious space is conveniently located just 11 miles from New York City. 'The Cozzarelli Funeral home is a glowing testimonial to architectural excellence and superiority in design and appointment. Imagine a fine restaurant...private club...dinner theatre...art gallery...exclusive boutique...,' writes the Sroka Worldwide Team at Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Vulture.com reports that location scouts for The Sopranos didn't discover the beautiful funeral home until days before they shot Tony Soprano's mother Livia's farewell. Owner James Cozzarelli said that when his secretary called him to tell him that HBO wanted to know if they could use the home, he thought it was a prank. What formed was a relationship that lasted until the final season. Cozzarelli Jr. was able to gain his Sag-AFTRA card after appearing in nearly every burial scene. Chance discovery: The funeral home's owner says that his space was discovered just days before Tony Soprano's mother Livia's funeral was shot . Relationship: The Sopranos then filmed every funeral at the home thereafter for the rest of the show's run . Sadly James Gandolfini who playedTony Soprano died earlier this year. When the news broke, the show's fans gathered to make a makeshift memorial for him outside of the funeral home. Cozzarelli says that Gandolfini was humble and a creative genius. Locals would cook Italian food for the actor and bring it to him when he was shooting the show. 'All the Italian ladies from the neighborhood would come, and they would make food for him and bring it to the funeral home,' he says. 'He accepted all of it. He was a precious guy.' When asked by Vulture what Cozzarelli's favorite scene was he said the one in which the character Uncle Junior played by Dominic Chianese breaks down and cries. 'He could turn on the emotion of sorrow so magnificently,' remembers Cozzarelli, who says the cast and crew gave Chianese tons of applause. 'It was otherworldly.' What's to come: Despite having once served as a funeral home, the space could be transformed into something new like a supper club or a restaurant . Lasting memory: Though the show nor Tony Soprano are no longer alive the space is a living memory of the show's masterful creation and each actor's genius body of work .","The Irvine-Cozzarelli Memorial Home in which Tony Soprano attended his mother Livia's funeral is for sale for $1.8 million by Douglas Elliman .

"Camilla Long, who alleges that Travis groped her during an interview, was demanded to move by the former DJ because she was making him feel 'uncomfortable . Travis demanded one of his alleged victims move seats in the courtroom, saying she was making him ‘uncomfortable’. In a bizarre episode moments before he was sentenced, he confronted journalist Camilla Long, who has told how he allegedly groped her during an interview. He spotted she was sitting in the courtroom’s public gallery, just behind the glass-panelled dock where he was awaiting sentence, and rounded on her, banging on the glass between them. He shouted through the toughened security glass, saying: ‘You’re making me uncomfortable. Get where you should be – in the Press gallery.’ Miss Long, a Sunday Times columnist, gestured to the packed Press benches and said the seats were all full. Travis turned to the Press and shouted: ‘Anyone want to give her a seat?’ The uncomfortable exchange was interrupted when the judge re-entered the courtroom at Southwark Crown Court to pass his sentence on Travis. In a 2012 article, published five months before Travis was first arrested, Miss Long said the former DJ had repeatedly groped and fondled her during an interview about his forthcoming meeting with Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. She wrote: ‘I spent 90 minutes with the former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis and I don’t think there is a part of my body that he didn’t grope. ‘He fondled my foot, inched his hands up my thighs, tried to make me sit on his lap and kissed me. ‘He copped a feel of my hips when I foolishly asked for a tour of his studio, stroked my chin and my back and gave me a full body hug as I left.’ Miss Long was asked to give evidence at the trial but said she had declined as she wanted to write about the episode immediately and could not have done so if she had been a witness. Dave Lee Travis said he is not a 'sexual predator' after he was handed a suspended sentence for one count of sexual assault . Travis was not charged with any offence in connection with her account. Speaking after the sentencing, Miss Long said she had found the courtroom confrontation with Travis ‘incredibly intimidating’. She added: ‘I’m a little bit disappointed, I would have liked a slightly harsher sentence.’ The single guilty verdict against Travis leaves taxpayers with a bill of up to £1million. The former BBC star was forced to sell his home to help pay his own £350,000 legal costs. But that sum is dwarfed by the costs run up by police, prosecutors and the courts. Even before his first trial started in January, huge amounts had been run up during the police inquiry. Travis then spent 39 days in court spread across two trials, potentially costing around £400,000. On top of this is the salary of the judge, court staff and legal clerks, remuneration for jurors and overheads at the courthouse. The Crown Prosecution Service was unable to provide a detailed breakdown of its costs, but the bill for hiring Miranda Moore, QC, in the first trial was £59,061.23.","Travis demanded columnist Camilla Long move from the public gallery .

"Doctors operating on a high school football player who had broken his leg discovered that the young man had a giant tumor growing in his body. Max O'Rourke, a star quarterback for the Rocklin High Thunder in Rocklin, California, was rushed to the hospital Friday night after breaking his leg during a game, initially devastated that the injury meant his season would be cut short. That all changed however when doctors discovered the 17-year-old had a large benign tumor growing in his leg. Scroll down for video . Blessing: Rocklin High quarterback Max O'Rourke (above with a friend) discovered he had a giant tumor growing in his leg after being admitted to the hospital with a broken femur Friday night . Getting better: O'Rourke (before surgery on left and with a friend on right) has had the tumor successfully removed, but now will not be able to walk for seven weeks . The tumor was revealed when doctors took an x-ray of O'Rourke's leg to get a better look at his broken femur. The leg was broken when a defender tackled Max as he went to throw a pass during the game, and hit the ground at an odd angle. Doctors also believe the bone was weakened by the tumor, which was putting an immense amount of pressure on O'Rourke's leg. 'I didn’t expect to be in this situation, but here I am, and you can either live with it or you can just be angry at the world,' O'Rourke told CBS 13. 'And I chose to live with it and be positive.' Doctors say that he should be walking again, without assistance, in seven weeks. Star player: O'Rourke (posing above with the Heisman Trophy) was one of the top ranked quarterbacks in the state of California . Staying strong: 'I chose to live with it and be positive,' says O'Rourke of news of the tumor (seen above with his friend Melissa at Homecoming just days before surgery) 'A tragic moment to a blessing in disguise,' is how Max's father Michael is now describing the event. Adds his mother, Erin, 'His legs going to be that much stronger, he’s going to be that much more driven and I think he has been a huge inspiration to his teammates.' And while the young man and his family are staying positive, that doesn't make it any easier for the player, ranked one of the best in the state, to have to sit out his final season of high school football. 'Up until this point I had only missed one game, ever, my entire football career,”said O'Rourke, who is now focusing on returning in time to play on his high school basketball team this winter. 'It just sucks not being out there anymore.'","Max O'Rourke, the star quarterback for the Rocklin High Thunder of Rocklin, California, was admitted to the hospital after breaking his leg on Friday .

"Katelyn Mallyon, 20, could be earning mega dollars as a model in the United States, instead she earns about $500 a week for the dubious privilege of waking at 4 o'clock most mornings to ride 500 kilograms of horse flesh at a speed of more than 70 kilometres an hour around a dark race track. All in the hope that one day she will be star of the 'big show' - the Melbourne Cup Carnival. 'Yes, I actually got a contract from America for a modelling career but I turned that down, it was either that or be a jockey and I always wanted to be a jockey,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I definitely don't regret my decision at all, I'm living the dream.' A dream which turned into a nightmare on May 19, 2012 - an horrific fall which could have cost her more than just a riding career. Katelyn came crashing down from her mount, Deliver The Dream, in a Winter Championship Heat at Flemington. Scroll down for video . Katelyn Mallyon chose to be a jockey instead of signing a modelling contract in the United States . Katelyn aims to one day be the star of the 'big show' - the Melbourne Cup Carnival . Katelyn (left, and middle on the right) says she has no regrets about not choosing a career on the catwalk . She suffered a fractured spine, spleen damage, broken cheekbone, was put in a coma for four days and spent nine months on the sideline recovering. 'It was a difficult time but I'm very glad that I just can't remember it,' she said. 'Looking back on it, though, it was such a heavy fall so I was very, very lucky.' But having had her life on the line 'doesn't really faze me'. 'It would be a lot different if I remembered it, I guess.' On further reflection, still no regrets. 'There was definitely no looking back though, as soon as I woke from my coma I said to my mum, ""when's my next ride? What's happening to all my horses"", there was never any concern about getting back in the saddle,' she said. 'All that time out really made me appreciate what I get to do for a job.' She's more determined than ever to get to the top and her competitive streak led to a suspension which ends on Oaks Day .. and she can't wait. 'I have one ride that day, on Klishina (in the Mumm Stakes), I'm really looking forward to being out there,' she added. No glitz and glam for this apprentice though - she'll earn $180 for her day's work. Katelyn Mallyon calls her riding career 'living the dream' but it turned into a nightmare on May 19, 2012 -  when she suffered an horrific fall which could have cost her more than just her job as a jockey . 4am starts are 'just part of the job' according to Katelyn Mallyon. Here she's pictured at a relatively quiet Flemington carrying out  trackwork during the Cup Carnival week. She's back from suspension on Thursday, Oaks Day . An apprentice is on a basic salary of barely $500 a week but Katelyn Mallyon loves the game too much to worry about money matters or possing getting hurt again. 'I have had my bad fall and hopefully that's it for me. You don't go out there thinking that I'm going to die or anything like that which definitely can happen as we know with poor Caitlin (Forrest) and Carly Mae-Pye up in Queensland,' she said. 'It's something that we love doing and we don't think about it if you do start thinking along those lines than you're better off not doing it. 'Definitely this is one of the most dangerous things anyone can do anywhere in the world, it's the only job where an ambulance follows you around all day, after all. It's pretty extreme.' If it's not risking their life each time they get legged aboard a thoroughbred, then weight is always an issue, for any jockey, female or male. 'It's definitely a struggle it's hard to always try and think what you are putting in your mouth and what you will have to do to work that off,' she said. 'It can be hard at times, not getting to go out and enjoy yourself but it's something you have to sacrifice.' The champion apprentice suffered a fractured spine, spleen damage, broken cheekbone, was put in a coma for four days and spent nine months on the sideline recovering . Katelyn says she is 'living the dream' and that time out of the sport made her really appreciate what she gets to do for a job . The 4am starts began for Katelyn as a 14-year-old and she began riding in races at 16. 'It's in my blood, I love it. I actually rode my first racehorse when I was two years old,' she said. 'I was always around the horses. I have always wanted to be a jockey.' Her claim that it's in the blood is no idle boast. Parents, Brett and Mary, were both jockeys as was her grandfather, Mick and her brother Andrew. The early mornings, she insists, is something she grew up with in the Mallyon house-hold. 'I even remember when I was out for nine months with my broken back and I would always wake up early and I couldn't get back to sleep, my body clock is trained now, that's just the way it is.' Other dreams must go too. Not only did the champion Victorian apprentice happily forgo a lucrative modelling offer in the bright lights of New York, her other sporting pursuits have gone by the wayside. 'I played basketball for eight years and netball for four years and really got into them, I was going to pursue basketball but had to give up that and focus on race riding,' she said. Katelyn Mallyon looks on as Jake Noonan is assisted by medical staff after falling from his mount, Safe, in race eight at the Environmental Services Handicap at Flemington Racecourse on May 7, 2011 in Melbourne . Katelyn has three rides on the last day of the carnival, Emirates Stakes Day but will be on track today for the race that stops a nation . Katelyn has three rides on the last day of the carnival, Emirates Stakes Day but will be on track today for the race that stops a nation. 'I will actually go to the Cup and watch Chad ride (her partner) in the Cup and hopefully he can win it.' 'The public don't get a chance to see everything we do (behind the scenes) and the extent of it and the danger factor,' she said. 'When I was growing up I would tell all my friends that I was going to the races in the middle of winter and they would be like ""what races, they only race in Spring"", but people seem to have a better understanding of what we do.' And she is making quite the impact. A champion apprentice already, with almost 20 city winners under her belt and a better strike rate (winners to runners) than established riding superstars like Glen Boss and Craig Williams. With one eye already on Flemington for Cup Day she says that's it really is the best carnival and they are the best horses. 'I want to be the best. I've still got a long way to go but I do want to be the best'. And you wouldn't bet against it.","Katelyn Mallyon turned down a modelling career in the U.S. to be a jockey .

"The preparations for war are over. My pilot, John Peters, and I are sitting at the threshold of the runway in a fully-armed Tornado bomber. Outside it is pitch black, the dead of night. All the doubts and fears I’ve battled in the past few weeks begin to recede as we prepare for the technical practicalities of modern warfare. Instruments, weapons, fuel, defensive systems, flight controls — everything is checked, double checked, and then checked again. Glancing around the gloomy airfield I can see the flashing lights of myriad aircraft, their crews carefully going through the endless procedures that will make a dangerous mission as risk-free as possible. Beneath us, the awesome power of the jet bucks and strains to be released as John winds up the engines to maximum power. I glance over to the aircraft on our right and give a friendly wave through the darkness. I can’t see if my friend responds. Scroll down for video . Beaten and paraded on Iraqi TV: John Nichol was shot down by a surface-to-air missile and taken as a hostage in Baghdad by Iraqi soldiers . As the massive twin engines, in full afterburner, throw sheets of flame out of the rear of the aircraft, we blast into the night sky and are on our way at several hundred miles an hour towards the target. It is the early hours of January 17, 1991, the first night of the first Gulf war in Iraq, and there is no turning back from whatever the coming hours hold for us. Of course we are nervous, but we are also ready and there is no time for fear. We have been trained for this moment and we are determined to succeed, to prove ourselves in battle, and to survive ... Scenes like this one — which is still seared in my memory — may be unfolding in the Middle East just a few hours from now as our armed forces prepare, once again, to go to war. The horrific footage of Islamic State terrorist fighters beheading innocent hostages has goaded the U.S. into action, and a coalition of nations is already striking ISIS targets from the air. And where America deploys the ‘big stick’, its staunch ally Britain normally follows. Our military personnel — mostly young men and women — have been ordered on to a war footing and it is highly likely the Royal Air Force will soon join the fray against the jihadists in Iraq. Bags are being packed, wills reviewed, children and loved ones will be hugged more closely than usual. It will only take a debate in Parliament today to seal the decision to send our war planes over Iraq again. The prospect of battle is perhaps only hours away, so how will those involved be feeling? I can clearly remember my emotions in the build-up to Operation Desert Storm — the operation to liberate Kuwait — in 1991. The predictable worry and uncertainty was mixed with a sense of anticipation, even excitement. War is the job I had been trained for, so there is a sense of wanting to test oneself to the full. For me the sense of destiny was very real: the world was watching events unfold on its TV screens in much the same way we are today. To be part of history on this scale felt electrifying. As our commander put it, we were going to be the ‘thunder and lightning’ of Desert Storm. But, at the same time, there was a real sense of trepidation . . . My Tornado squadron was based on the island of Bahrain and on the eve of the war to evict Saddam Hussein’s troops from Kuwait, the tension on our base was palpable. I needed to get away, to collect my thoughts, so I went for a jog along the coast. My abiding memory of that time is of sitting on the rocks, staring out to sea and contemplating that I may not have long to live. My two young nieces had sent me a cassette tape and, as I listened to their innocent voices telling me of the excitement of birthdays and the presents they had received, it was hard to suppress my tears. I had prepared for the practicalities of war, including a will to be made. But the hardest thing was to write the ‘last letters’ that would be delivered to loved ones only if the worst happened. It is an almost impossibly poignant task to tell them that if they are actually reading that letter then you will not be coming home — ever. Visit Atlantic Speaker Bureau . John Peters, Mr Nichol's pilot. The pair were finally released after seven weeks but were subject to beatings, mock executions and being paraded on TV . How do you explain that no matter how much it hurts they must be strong and get on with the rest of their lives? How do you express the depth of your love in a letter that you hope will never be read? There was also a real eagerness, perhaps even desperation, to get into combat. Yet I remember feeling sick when I thought about what the coming hours might bring. I was about to fight and possibly die. But the thought at the forefront of my mind was not ‘Will I survive?’, it was ‘I just hope I don’t let my mates down.’ The other thought was about capture and possible torture — and perhaps this is a consideration high on the minds of those preparing to go to war again there today. Saddam Hussein had ordered his people to tear any captured aircrew ‘limb from limb’. John, my friend as well as my pilot, and I had agreed that if we were faced with the enemy, rather than being captured, we would provoke a shoot-out which would result in our deaths, perhaps taking a few of them with us. We hoped we would never have to test the theory. Days after that conversation, we were screaming over our target at around 600mph, just 50ft above the desert, and turning to head back to base. Our bombing mission had been a dismal failure and we were returning dejected, wondering what our mates would say about making a cock-up of our very first mission. Suddenly, a heat-seeking surface-to-air missile slammed into the right-hand engine of our jet. It was like being hit by an express train. As the titanium-laced missile warhead exploded, the 30-ton jet was blasted sideways like a leaf in the wind, moments later, as the plane blew up in flames, I keyed the transmit button on the radio, ‘Ejecting, Ejecting’. As the ejection seat rockets fired it was like being grabbed by a giant hand and thrown into the middle of a cauldron of fire, gales, confusion and fear. Seconds later, the parachute deployed and I was on the ground in the heart of the enemy desert. It was an overwhelming sensation and I wanted to sit down and let circumstances wash over me — to let someone else take control. But you can’t just give up, you have to continue the fight until all the options are exhausted. John and I were on the run in the desert for a couple of hours before shots rang out and the sand around us was blasted by a hail of bullets. We were now faced with the terrible dilemma we had always feared. Fight and die? Or surrender? I can still see John turning towards me saying, ‘there’s always hope’. We put our guns down and were captured. I truly thought I might die in those first few seconds as the Iraqi soldiers beat us to the ground in blind rage. Luckily, an officer managed to calm them down and we were loaded onto a vehicle. The sense of fear and desperation was coursing through me, but I still held out hope of survival. My fear was heightened as a young Bedouin boy who had guided the soldiers to our position began to draw his finger across his throat in a slitting motion. The immediate future looked bleak. We were taken to Baghdad, and the brutality of those weeks of capture was terrible — beatings, mock executions, cigarettes stubbed out on our skin, and of course, being humiliatingly paraded on TV. But there was also hope — yes it would have been easy for them to kill us, indeed one of Saddam Hussein’s sons apparently ordered that we should be shot. We always had hope that we might survive and be reunited with our loved ones. And eventually, after seven weeks, we were. After a short and successful campaign, the allied coalition won and we were released to the Red Cross. As today’s generation of young men and women prepare to take to the skies in anger once again over Iraq, the terrible prospect of capture after being shot down must be at the forefront of their thoughts. But this time it is even more chilling — for the brutal, public murder of ISIS hostages by beheading is well understood by all involved. These are highly trained professionals, however, and any concerns in their minds will be pushed aside. It may sound inane to outsiders, but fears for one’s own fate are daily realities for modern military people. They know the risks, they understand the dangers. But they cannot, will not, let those concerns influence their actions. Just as I was paid to do the job 24 years ago, so they have taken the ‘Queen’s shilling’ to carry out their orders today. They will want to test themselves in battle, they will want to fight bravely, they will not want to let their mates down. That is the very ethos of military life. And whatever trials and hardships the coming days bring our armed forces, I know they will acquit themselves with courage, dignity and professionalism. As a country, we can be justifiably proud of them.","Mr Nichol took part in Operation Desert Storm to liberate Kuwait in 1991 .

"A younger brother and sister left their suburban Chicago home and were detained at O'Hare International Airport along with their 19-year-old brother last month — all of them intent on traveling to Syria to join Islamic State militants, a prosecutor alleged on Monday while pushing for the older brother to remain behind bars. The jailed Mohammed Hamzah Khan was the only one charged, but prosecutor Richard Hiller said Khan's 16-year-old brother and 17-year-old sister were also passionate about the Islamic State. Hiller said the girl once used the Twitter handle @DeathIsTheeNear  to send a favorable tweet about a video of beheadings — even placing a smiley emoticon in the text. Scroll down for video . Mohammed Hamzah Khan, accused of seeking to join Islamic State militants in Syria, will remain behind bars pending trial . Authorities announced Khan's Oct. 4 arrest at O'Hare several days after it happened. On Monday, they revealed for the first time that his siblings were detained with him that same day, all three with airplane tickets to Istanbul, Turkey, which borders Syria. At the end of the 2½-hour detention hearing in federal court in Chicago, U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan Cox ruled the government amply showed that Khan poses a potential threat and a flight risk and therefore shouldn't be released. 'He was prepared to abandon his home, his family, his country and his citizenship to join (the Islamic State),' Cox said. Defense attorney Thomas Durkin had called on Cox to grant Khan supervised release so he could get counseling. The Chicago Tribune reports Durkin said that Khan's family would post its home and roughly $100,000 in equity as collateral. Durkin claimed there was not 'one iota' of evidence that Khan planned to hurt anyone and that the teen may have been influence by misinformation and propaganda on the internet. 'There is time to modify this behavior ... which is, I think, needed here,' he said. 'We can't give up on these kids.' Khan is charged with seeking to provide material support to a foreign terrorist group, which carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence. Prosecutors gave no indication they are even contemplating charges against his siblings, who they never referred to by name. Thomas Durkin, defense attorney for Mohammed Hamzah Khan, speaks with reporters following a detention hearing for his client at the federal building in Chicago, Monday . Hiller described Khan as the instigator of the plan to join the Islamic State. He said Khan's meticulous planning included landing a job at a Chicago-area store to earn money for the three plane tickets. 'He tried to take his high school-aged siblings halfway around the world to a war zone,' Hiller said. The prosecutor said all three spoke of acts of violence, with the sister writing about ""preparing for death."" 'He and his siblings not only had barbaric rhetoric ... they tried to carry it out,' he said. Prosecutors have previously said Khan left his parents a handwritten letter in his bedroom that expressed anger over his U.S. taxes being used to kill his 'Muslim brothers and sisters.' His siblings left similar letters, Hiller told the court Monday. 'My heart is crying with the thought I left you and I probably will never see you again in this (world),' Khan’s sister wrote her mother '… The future is very uncertain. By the time you are reading this we could be captured, or stranded or possibly even killed.' Meanwhile, his younger brother wrote a letter and left it in the room he shared with Khan. 'The evil of this country makes me sick,' the unnamed brother wrote. 'They tricked us Muslims and enticed us with an easy life and wealth.' He called Muslims who did not back a jihad 'diseased with hypocrisy.' At Monday's hearing, Durkin called the case against his client 'hopelessly weak.' He said Khan and his siblings appeared to have fallen under the influence of 'slick' Islamic State propaganda. Durkin has previously said the parents did not know of their son's plans to travel to Syria.","Jailed Mohammed Hamzah Khan was the only one charged .

Many of the photos feature animals threatened by extinction due to mass poaching, such as the white rhino and African elephant. One of the images shows a flock of egrets flying around a white rhino's head. Mr Van Den Berg took the photo several years ago in South Africa - and says poachers killed the animal this year. He said: 'I was lucky to capture the rhino with egrets flying around its head. They seem to form a halo around the animal as if it were a saint. 'Rhinos in South Africa are being poached at an alarming rate. 'Last year more than 1,000 rhinos were killed for their horns. For this reason I have a real affection for these creatures.' On his travels, the full-time photographer visited Madagascar to see sifakas, a type of lemur, and to Botswana to catch a rare sighting of a leopard. He added: 'I love photographing leopards.

"Every artist has their own way of dealing with their critics, but it seems that architect Frank Gehry's is more direct than most. When asked at a press conference how he felt about people calling his buildings a 'spectacle', he stared silently for a few moments before raising his middle finger. He then went on to rant about how 98 per cent of the world's buildings are 'pure sh*t' saying the designers had 'no sense of design, no respect for humanity or for anything else'.

He later apologised, saying he was 'jet lagged' Gehry, the man behind the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, was speaking to reporters after unveiling his latest construction, the Fondation Louis Vuitton in the Bois de Boulogne park, Paris. After making the crude gesture early on, he was then asked if he thought 'emblematic buildings' had a place in modern cities. He replied: 'Let me tell you one thing. In this world we are living in, 98 per cent of everything that is built and designed today is pure sh*t. 'There’s no sense of design, no respect for humanity or for anything else. They are damn buildings and that’s it. 'Once in a while, however, a group of people do something special. Very few, but God, leave us alone. We are dedicated to our work. 'I don’t ask for work … I work with clients who respect the art of architecture. Therefore, please don’t ask questions as stupid as that one.' He then went on to praise his own buildings, saying that Bilbao was an example of how good architecture could turn a town from an industrial waste ground and into a cultural hub. The well-known designer was giving a press conference following the opening of his new building, the Louis Vuitton Foundation art museum, in Paris . Gehry's fame was cemented by his eccentric Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, which he went on to praise as an example of how good architecture can turn an area around . He later apologised for the remarks, saying that he was jet-lagged and that the reporters had caught him 'in a bad mood', according to El Pais.

There he made a name for himself designing Easy Edge furniture, made from cardboard, and before taking on his first building by remodeling a house for his family in Santa Monica. The design, which involved cladding the property with corrugated iron and splitting the roof  with a huge skylight, caught the attention of the design world, and he soon moved on to bigger projects. The Exhibit Center, Merriweather Post Pavilion, and Rouse Company Headquarters was his first large building project in 1974. His most famous work, The Guggenheim Museum, was inaugurated on October 18, 1997. Works since include the twisted Gehry Tower and the Dancing Building, in Prague. Critics of Gehry have accused his buildings of being a distracting spectacle for corporate backers keen to improve their image.

"Former TVAM presenter Mike Morris died after NHS staff failed to spot warning signs following bladder cancer surgery, an inquest has heard. Mr Morris, who made his name alongside Lorraine Kelly and Anne Diamond on the breakfast show, was only 66 when he died two years ago. He had been fully expected to recover from an operation at East Surrey Hospital, to correct bleeding following bladder cancer surgery. But an inquest in Surrey heard that a succession of failures by doctors, over many hours, led to a cardiac arrest in the early hours of the morning. Former TVAM presenter Mike Morris died after NHS staff failed to spot his deterioration following bladder cancer surgery, an inquest has heard.  Mr Morris made his name alongside Lorraine Kelly  on the show . Medical witnesses told the coroner how his condition had deteriorated with no action taken to move him from a general ward to a high dependency unit. Coroner Karen Henderson said: 'Mr Morris died from complications of necessary surgery when post operative deterioration in his condition was not recognised and consequently went un-treated.' His death had been completely unexpected and no members of his family were present when he died in early hours of the morning at the Redhill hospital in October 2012. Morris, who got a world exclusive interview with Nelson Mandela on his release from jail, had undergone surgery a week earlier but had developed bleeding in his urine and been re-admitted for surgery to stem significant blood loss. He was given 5 units of blood and placed on a ward to recover. An early warning system which monitors vital signs such as pulse, blood pressure, breathing and heart rate, soon showed that Morris needed more intensive help than was available on the ward. But a succession of nurses and doctors failed to act on the warning signs, the inquest was told. Pictured with Christine Talbot on   Yorkshire TV News. He was only 66 when he died two years ago . Mr Morris went into cardiac arrest at around 6am and died at 7.10am. Gregory Armon-Jones, who is married to Mr Morris's daughter, Helen, said the family was shocked by his diagnosis but they had taken heart from the fact his cancer was a low grade and could be easily treated. He said: 'He had various health problems, including heart problems. He also had bladder cancer but, as far as we were concerned, this was under control.' He said that the news of his death shocked the family. Mr Armon-Jones, said: 'He was a larger than life character. 'You only have to watch some of the old videos of him presenting to see that. He had separated from my mother-in-law and lived on his own. 'His whole life revolved around his family, especially his two daughters Helen and Sarah, and his grandchildren. 'One of the reasons myself and Helen moved to Hersham in Surrey was to be closer to him. TV-am presenters and guests Rula Lenska, Dennis Waterman, Jane Irving, Elizabeth Carrol, Anne Diamond and Mr Morris. An inquest in Surrey heard that a succession of failures by doctors, over many hours, led to his cardiac arrest . He had been fully expected to recover from an operation at East Surrey Hospital, to correct bleeding following bladder cancer surgery . Dr Des Holden, medical director at Surrey & Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'The review shows aspects of Mr Morris' care after his emergency surgery were below that which he and his family were entitled to expect. 'The trust has apologised to Mr Morris' family and has introduced a range of measures to improve the post-operative care for high risk patients. 'The capacity in both the Intensive Care Unit and the High Dependency Unit have been increased to cope with demand and changes have been made to the way the ICU and outreach teams are staffed and the work patterns within the teams.' Mr Holden said no members of staff had been disciplined as 'our investigation showed everyone involved in Mr Morris's care was trying to do their best for him.' Famous for his distinctive moustache, Morris joined TV-am as a sports presenter, eventually becoming the host of Good Morning Britain in 1987. He remained with TV-am until 1992. During his stint as main weekday anchor, he presented alongside Anne Diamond, Kathy Rochford, Kathryn Holloway, Kathy Tayler, Linda Mitchell, Maya Even and Lorraine Kelly.","He'd been fully expected to recover from operation at East Surrey Hospital .

"They have been credited for inspiring some of the most popular songs of a generation. Now scientists claim they are closer to understanding why magic mushrooms cause people to have such intense creative and spiritual experiences. Scans have revealed that its active ingredient, psilocybin, creates a hyperconnected mind that links regions of the brain that are normally have nothing to do with each other. Scans have revealed that its active ingredient, psilocybin, creates a hyperconnected mind (right) that links up regions of the brain that normally don't talk to each other. On the left is how a brain under placebo appears . This triggers vivid hallucinations, often making colours seem oversaturated and breaking up the boundaries between objects. The increased brain activity could also be responsible for synaesthesia - the phenomenon where different senses are associated with others, according to UK scientists. Some magic mushroom users have, for instance, reported tasting colours, seeing noises or feeling smells. '[Users] report it as one of the most profound experiences they've had in their lives, even comparing it to the birth of their children,' study co-author Paul Expert, a physicist at King's College London, told Live Science. Some magic mushroom users have  reported tasting colours, seeing noises or feeling smells. '[Users] report it as one of the most profound experiences they've had in their lives, even comparing it to the birth of their children,' said study co-author Paul Expert, a physicist at King's College London . Professor Expert compared fMRI images of the brains of placebo-takers and the brains of mushroom-takers, and found they were significantly different. According to his study, the brains of drug-takers featured a host of regional links not usually created during normal brain activity. Professor Expert said the study could help them understand the usefulness of psilocybin in treating disorders like depression. They also believe their study in brain connectivity could lead to answers for other long-standing questions in science. Long time smokers were more successful in kicking the habit when taking magic mushrooms . Quitting smoking is a goal that many fail to achieve. But a study has found that long time smokers were more successful in kicking the habit when taking psilocybin - the active hallucinogenic agent in 'magic mushrooms'. The controlled experiment found that 80 per cent of participants successfully quit after six months. The research was carried out by the John Hopkins University in Baltimore. In the study ten men and five women, all mentally and physically healthy, took part. Each had smoked an average of 19 cigarettes a day for 31 years but had repeatedly tried to quit, without success. Each participant was given a dose of psilocybin in pill form on a day they planned to quit smoking. Two and eight weeks later they were then given higher doses of the drug. Each drug-taking session lasted six to seven hours, during which they were kept in a safe and comfortable setting. They often wore eyeshades and listened to music while being told to relax. In addition they undertook weekly counselling and kept a diary to monitor their cravings. By the end of the study 12 of the 15 participants were able to quit smoking completely. The researchers add that the experiment is not an endorsement for taking magic mushrooms, but rather highlights how psilocybin can be useful in controlled environments. 'The big question in neuroscience is where consciousness comes from,' co-author Giovanni Petri, a mathematician at Italy's Institute for Scientific Interchange, told Wired. 'We don't know.' A separate study earlier this year revealed incredible similarities with brains scanned while a person is dreaming and those who had taken magic mushrooms. Psilocybin was found to increase activity in the parts of the more primitive parts of the brain linked to emotional thinking, prompting several regions to become active at once. However, volunteers who had taken the drug showed 'uncoordinated' activity in those areas of the brain linked to high-level thinking, including self-consciousness. Magic mushrooms vivid hallucinations, often making colours seem oversaturated and breaking up the boundaries between objects. Some users report having spiritual experiences . 'What we have done in this research is begin to identify the biological basis of the reported mind expansion associated with psychedelic drugs,' said Dr Robin Carhart-Harris from the Department of Medicine, Imperial College London. 'People often describe taking psilocybin as producing a dreamlike state and our findings have, for the first time, provided a physical representation for the experience in the brain.' One particular network that was especially affected plays a central role in the brain, essentially 'holding it all together' and is linked to our sense of self. In comparison, activity in the different areas of a more primitive brain network became more synchronised under the drug, indicating they were working in a more coordinated, 'louder' fashion.","Active chemical, psilocybin, causes dramatic increase in brain activity .

"MILLIONS of self-employed workers risk poverty in retirement because only one in five now has a personal pension. The ‘timebomb’ was revealed in official figures showing that even though their ranks have swelled by 700,000 during the economic crisis, the number of self-employed with a pension has plummeted. The Office for National Statistics says 22 per cent of self-employed men had a personal pension last year compared with 37 per cent in 2006. The number of self-employed people who are saving for their retirement has plummeted according to new figures . The data did not include women, who are even less likely than men to have a personal pension. Research by insurance firm Prudential found that because of low wage growth more than half said they could not afford contributions. ‘This is a very risky approach which could leave them facing a significant drop in their standard of living as they enter retirement,’ it said. Research showed that because of a low wage growth, more than half of people said they could not afford contributions . However, the ONS found a marked rise in the number of employees in workplace pensions. Almost half are now members of a scheme, with take-up boosted by the Government’s new auto-enrolment scheme. Pensions guru Ros Altmann said: ‘The big attraction of workplace pension is that you get an employer contribution. Therefore, the attraction of pensions for self-employed is far lower.’ Tom McPhail, pensions expert at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the demands of running their own business meant it was ‘hardly surprising that the self-employed haven’t seen pensions as a high priority .","ONS figures reveal only 22 per cent of self-employed men have a pension .

"A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of terrorist offences in a dawn raid in east London. The suspect was held in Hackney, north east London, on suspicion of assisting another to commit acts of terrorism by travelling abroad. Police searched the property where he was arrested and he was questioned at a police station in central London. Scotland Yard later announced he had been bailed until December. A 21-year-old man from Hackney, north east London is being held on suspicion of helping another travel abroad in an investigation believed to be linked to Syria. File photo . It is understood that the arrest is linked to Syria, where hundreds of would-be jihadis have travelled to fight alongside extremists group ISIS. Counter-terrorism experts in the UK have expressed increasing concern about what will happen if a slew of militarised fighters decide to return home. A police spokesman said: 'A man arrested in Hackney on Wednesday 29 October on suspicion of terrorism offences has been bailed. 'The 21-year-old was arrested at around 0600hrs at a residential address in Hackney on suspicion of assisting another to commit acts of terrorism, or to engage in any conduct for the committing of such acts, by facilitating another to travel abroad of the Terrorism Act 2006. 'He had been taken to a south London police station, where he was later bailed to return to on a date in late December, pending further enquiries. A search at the residential address in Hackney has been completed.'. It comes after a 32-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman were arrested by anti-terror police in two unconnected probes also linked to Syria last week. The arrest comes after a raid in Bedford (pictured) last week, which was also linked to Syria . Police search a property in Bedford last week as part of a series of raids investigating Syria-related terror . The man was arrested in west London on suspicion of having visited a terrorist training camp and the woman was arrested in Bedford in another terror probe. Four properties, two in west London and two in Bedford, were searched by specialist police officers as part of their enquiries. Earlier this month, a number of terror suspects were charged with plotting to kill policemen and soldiers in London drive-by shootings. Tarik Hassane, 21, Suhaib Majeed, 20, Nyall Hamlett, 24, and Momen Motasim, 21, all from London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court amid tight security as they were charged with an Islamic State-inspired gun plot. It was alleged to have been formulated following a fatwa by a senior ISIS terrorist. Earlier this month, two houses in Portsmouth - including the family home of Ifthekar Jaman, a British man who died in Syria - were among properties raided by counter-terrorism police. Britain's top policeman, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said last week that at least five Britons a week are heading to the war-ravaged country to fight for Islamic State (ISIS) terrorists. Sir Bernard said: 'Those numbers are a minimum. There may be many more who set out to travel to another country and meandered over to Syria and Iraq in a way that is not always possible to spot when you have failed states and leaky borders.'

"A 25 stone woman on benefits this week revealed that she would love to lose weight but she simply can't afford it. Christina Briggs, 26, from Wigan, shared her story in Closer magazine and then on This Morning. The mother-of-two said she hates being a dress size 26 but she can't afford to eat healthily or join a gym. She said she needs more money from the government in order to improve her health. But is she right? Is it impossible to eat well and keep fit with limited funds? Scroll down for video . Wants to lose weight: 25st Christina Briggs appeared on yesterday's This Morning and said she can't afford to eat heathily . Appeal: The mother-of-two said she needs more help from the government to change her lifestyle . Not at all say a number of leading dietitians and fitness trainers. Personal trainer Julia Buckley, author of the Fat Burn Revolution, told MailOnline: 'Getting fit doesn't have to cost you a penny and eating healthily can certainly be cheaper than takeaways and fast food. 'You don't need to have access to a health club or to pay a trainer to start exercising. Even as a trainer myself, I often don't use any kit at all in my own workouts. In fact, for beginners or people who have a lot weight to lose, a few basic equipment-free moves might be the best way to get started. 'Most people have a pair of trainers they can put on and go out for a walk, jog or run (depending on their fitness level). If you have internet access you have no excuse at all because YouTube is full of free videos where professional trainers demonstrate exercises.' She added: 'If you have a bit more to spend, gym membership is now cheaper than ever before with some clubs charging less than £15 per month. Even getting professional coaching is now more affordable than ever with the help of the internet - I offer online fitness programmes from just £10 per week (so less than the price of a takeaway) with full support from me personally. Go for a run: It costs nothing to take a jog around your local park . 'In my book The Fat Burn Revolution, I outline a full 12-week programme of exercises which has got thousands of people into fantastic shape by training at home, with just a few basic pieces of equipment.' As Julia pointed out, keeping fit doesn't have to be expensive as anyone can go out for a brisk walk or run. While kit from some sports brands can be costly, supermarkets now stock fitness clothing at much more affordable prices. Budget chain Aldi regularly include sports kit in their 'special buys' (the latest range will be on sale in stores from 9th October) with trainers for £14.99, running socks for £2.99 and a long sleeve shirt for £9.99. Meanwhile parkrun offer free 5k runs to people every Saturday morning across the UK. The runs are open to all ages and abilities and you don't have to pay to take part. You just turn up and walk or run round the course. Julia added that when it comes to healthy eating, you don't have to spend a lot either. Healthy eating: Rice and stir-fried vegetables is a cheap and easy to make meal that's low in fat . She said: 'It has been shown time and again that you can eat healthily on a limited budget. If you can afford to buy takeaways you can certainly afford to eat healthily, it's more about where you're choosing to spend your income and the choices you're making. 'Think about it, for about 30p you can buy an apple, or an egg, or a courgette. Plus healthy foods give you more energy and make you feel fuller for longer, so you don't end up constantly reaching for more the way you do when eating junk food.' She added: 'The real issue for a lot of people is that they don't know how to make healthy food taste good, but again, there's a wealth of free resources on the internet with information how to cook tasty healthy meals.' Home work out: Sits up and press ups can be done without joining a gym . One of the people who shares her passion for healthy eating online is dietitian Nichola Whitehead. She shares a number of recipes for tasty, low fat meals and snacks on her website www.nicsnutrition.com. She told MailOnline: 'Eating less meat and more vegetarian protein can actually save you money, e.g. beans, lentils or pulses, and canned or frozen fruits and vegetables are often cheaper and just as nutritious as their fresh alternatives. 'High fat takeaways often cost more than a home-prepared healthy meal e.g. beans on toast with mushrooms. Buying fatty and sugary snacks means paying for 'empty calories' (calories with no nutrients) which can contribute to weight gain if eaten in excess!' Julia urges people like Christina to take some responsibility for their own health for their own good. She said: 'It's such a shame that people don't put more value on their own health, we all know the obesity crisis is putting a huge strain on the economy, there's nothing cheap about that! Budget buy: These Aldi running shoes cost £14.99 . 'The benefits of being fit and healthy are priceless, I know it can be hard to get started, but please don't use money as an excuse, it's a question of priorities, if you can afford takeaways, you can afford to be fit and healthy if you really want to be.' This is something Gareth Clement, 25, from Swansea learnt. He used to be obese but lost 7st after he started eating healthily and exercising. Now he helps over people follow his example through his business, Diet Right. He told MailOnline: 'Budget dieting can be easy with the right tools and great support, it can also be cost effective, saving you, not only money, but your life. Christina can lose weight. She is just stuck in a cycle and a habit that needs breaking.' He added: 'Eating healthy and exercising isn't expensive. Fresh food is always best. But you can buy bulk frozen chicken, veg that will keep for a few weeks. Keep an eye out for reduced to clear aisles for bargains. 'Losing weight doesn't mean making drastic changes, drinking water instead of fizzy pop can make a huge difference.' Kelii Grauer from Body Burn Online agrees. She said: 'There is a common misconception among many people like Christina that living an active healthy lifestyle is more expensive than choosing not to. These people may have a basic understanding of what encompasses a healthy lifestyle, however they may not have the education to make the choices, nor the knowledge on how to prioritise their own lives in order to get them there. 'The reality is that with a little planning and creativity, eating fresh and healthy is actually far less of a strain on the wallet, especially when planning meals for the whole family. 'When it comes to exercise, simply going for a short walk or light jog is the perfect place to start for beginners. The first step is always the hardest, but if you want to make the commitment to change, I guarantee that it will be the best thing that will happen in your life. For those wanting a little more or take their journey further, Body Burn Online can take you there with our one-stop shop to all your fitness and wellbeing in the comfort of your own home.'","Christina Briggs, 26, from Wigan, says she can't afford to lose weight .

"The Rebels bikie gang represents 'one of Australia's highest risk criminal threats' and its exiled president 'continues to to exert significant influence' over the group, according to court documents obtained by Daily Mail Australia. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison would not explain why he cancelled Rebels president Alex Vella's visa while the 61-year-old was holidaying in his native Malta five months ago, saying only the decision was made under 'character provisions'. Daily Mail Australia can now reveal the minister's decision relied on detailed intelligence provided by an Australian Crime Commission-led task force and outlined in a document tendered in the Federal Court last month. The Attero task force was established in 2012 to 'disrupt, disable and dismantle criminal activities of the Rebels MC - one of Australia's highest risk criminal threats', the document states. Scroll down for video . Alex Vella says he is a God-fearing, law-abiding family man who likes riding motorcylces with his mates. Police say the president of the Rebels leads a violent gang involved in kidnapping, extortion and drug dealing . Alex Vella, president of the Rebels outlaw motorcycle gang since 1973 (pictured centre), is challenging the government's decision to cancel his visa while he was visiting his native Malta in June . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison cancelled Rebels boss Alex Vella's visa under 'character provisions' on June 13 while Mr Vella was holidaying in his native Malta . Rebels president Alex Vella, second from left, has taken his fight against the Australian government's cancellation of his visa to the Federal Court, denying his the head of a criminal organisation . Attero investigators allege under Vella's leadership the Rebels have engaged in drug dealing, money laundering, serious assaults, kidnapping, extortion, firearms offences, threatening law enforcement officers and intimidating court witnesses. It is believed the gang has more than 2000 members across the country. 'The Rebels MC membership in Australia includes a significant number of individuals with criminal convictions,' the court document states. 'Between January 20012 and June 2013, 718 Rebels MC members, nominees and associates were either reported or arrested in relation to 1211 charges for offences ranging from violence related offences (including serious assault, stalking, kidnapping and affray), firearms and weapons offences, drugs offences, and property, street and traffic offences. 'Rebels MC members have used violence in a premeditated manner to discipline Rebels MC members who have been perceived to have breached Rebels MC rules, in disputes with other OMCGs, threaten law enforcement officers, intimidate court witnesses and extort businesses and individuals.' Vella denies running a criminal organisation and has challenged the Department of Immigration's decision in the Federal Court. The document detailing the Rebels' alleged criminal activity under Vella was annexed to an affidavit sworn on October 9 by Martin Bowles, secretary of the Department of Immigration. To help fund his legal battle, Vella - who is regularly described as a millionaire businessman - is selling $50 T-shirts on his website alexvella.com.au. The T-shirts feature a picture of him under the slogan 'BRING HIM HOME' on the front and a quote from Nelson Mandela on the back: 'To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity' He is also offering a stubby holder, car sticker and key ring package for $25. 'Show your Support!' the website states. 'Help Alex funding his legal fees by purchasing some of these cool items. (Of course you can also just make a donation without purchasing any items.)' 'Bring Him Home': Supporters of Alex Vella are being asked to help fund the Rebels president's legal fight against the cancellation of his visa. 'To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity'. Alex Vella quotes Nelson Mandela in his bid to be allowed to return to Australia. Catering to all budgets: Supporters of Alex Vella's fight to come home can buy a stubby holder, car sticker and key ring for $25 or just make a donation of any size. The Let Alex Vella Return to Australia Facebook page has received more than 21,000 likes. Wayne West wrote on Wednesday: 'I'd rather have a Rebels clubhouse in my street than a mosque...' Scotty Burke wrote the same day: 'U know what sh... me about this country, they cancel Alex's visa yet they have known terrorists flying in and out of Australia fighting for ISIS and other known terror groups. Let him come home ffs!!!' Vella arrived in Australia in 1963. He has regularly returned to Malta and was crowned light heaveyweight boxing champion of his homeland in 1978. He has never taken out Australian citizenship. True patriot: Rebels bikie boss Alex Vella says he is not a criminal and just wants to return to Australia so he can rejoin his family, run his motorcycle club and continue his charitable good works. Sometimes referred to as 'the Maltese Falcon', he has four sons, says he donates generously to charities and is a regular churchgoer. He describes the Rebels as 'family' and a 'brotherhood', not a criminal organisation. 'I have always worked hard and given back to community,' he states on his website. 'I have always voted and paid tax. All I want is to be able to return to my home of 46 years and be reunited with my family.' The Attero task force sees him differently, according to court documents. 'The Rebels MC presents a high threat to the Australian community,' the court documents says. 'This OMCG has demonstrated an ability to increase its geographical influence, diversify across illicit drug markets and launder illicit profits. 'Alessio Emanuel Vella has been the National President of the Rebels MC since 1973. During this 40 years he has overseen the expansion of the OMCG from three original chapters to the largest OMCG in Australia. He has and continues to exert significant influence over the Rebels MC in Australia. 'Mr Vella acknowledges he is the National President of the Rebels MC. He also acknowledges he is aware that several members of the Rebels MC have been involved in criminal activities. 'The fact that Rebels MC members remain members despite criminal convictions including convictions obtained whilst members of the OMCG contradicts Mr Vella's assertions the Rebels MC does not condone criminal activity by its members, and allow them to remain members. 'The Rebels MC have remained cohesive and disciplined through Mr Vella's strong leadership.' The Rebels has expanded from Australia to include international chapters in 20 other countries: Cambodia, Canada, Costa Rica, Croatia, England, Fiji, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Laos, Lebanon, Malta, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Thailand and the USA. The Attero task force comprises all state and territory police forces as well as the Australian Crime Commission, Australian Federal Police, Customs and Border Protection Service, Australian Tax Office, Australian Securities and Investments Commission and Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre.","Rebels boss Alex Vella has been stranded in Malta since his visa was cancelled on June 13, acording to court documents .

"The sister of a glamour model who was brutally murdered by her husband has died after turning to alcohol to help her cope with the loss. Hayley Wilkinson, 31, from Whoberley, Coventry, struggled with the pain of losing her beloved younger sister five years ago and died from poor health after turning to drink. Her heartbroken mother Catherine Bloomfield said her daughter started drinking heavily after her sister Kirsty, 24, was strangled by her lorry driver husband Paul Grabham in March 2009. Hayley Wilkinson, 31, from Whoberley, Coventry, struggled with the pain of losing her beloved younger sister . Hayley (left) turned to alcohol after her sister Kirsty (right) was brutally murdered five years ago by her husband following a violent vow. Their mother Catherine (centre) said she 'could not believe' she had lost both daughters . The 58-year-old, of Bridgend, South Wales, said: 'Grabham has got the blood of both my daughters on his hands. Hayley would still be here if her little sister hadn't been taken away. 'I just cannot believe what has happened - losing one child was bad enough. 'Kirsty's death was awful. You can't even comprehend it. You think you could predict the heartache but you couldn't come close. 'I just think if there was a God why does he let this sort of thing happen? I think to myself what have I ever done in my life to deserve this?' Grabham, 29, is currently serving a life sentence for murdering Kirsty after a row at their home in Swansea, South Wales. Kirsty was working part-time as a glamour model and in the entertainment business when she was strangled to death by Grabham. He later attempted to chop her body in half before stuffing it in a suitcase and dumping it at the side of the M4 motorway near Bridgend. The body was discovered by a lorry driver less than a week later. Hayley (left) had struggled to cope with the death of her younger sister (right) and started drinking to excess . Catherine Wilkinson (pictured left with her daughter Hayley and right with Kirsty) said Grabham had the 'blood of both her daughters on his hands' after her eldest daughter died after failing to cope with her sister's death . Kirsty's sister Hayley was in court for Grabham's trial and was forced to relive the final moments of her sister's life. After the trial, she moved to Coventry to try and get away from the painful memories. Ms Wilkinson said: 'She loved life, she was always giggling and didn't have a bad bone in her body. 'She was nice to everybody and she never ran anybody down. Hayley took people at face value.' However, she said her daughter turned to alcohol after failing to cope with her sister's death and died on October 11 due to alcohol-related causes and under-lying health problems. She said: 'She started to drink to excess five years ago. She had just lost her little sister and she couldn't cope. Hayley, who had a daughter, died on October 11 . 'Hayley would never have drank to the extent that she did if her little sister had still been here. 'The drink took over everything. It stopped her going out. She just sat on her own in her house. 'She never really had anyone for her in Coventry. She was basically on her own. 'Five years of drinking led to her death. She wasn't eating either, she was just drinking. 'I want to help people that have drink problems. Maybe they will look at Hayley and see what has happened to her and seek help. 'I honestly don't know what I could have done differently. Maybe I'd have locked her in her room, anything to protect her. 'I did try to get her help. I tried everything to help her but Hayley marched to her own tune and she was her own person. 'She thought she was invincible. She never thought for a second that this would happen.' Hayley's funeral was held at Canley Crematorium in Coventry on October 17 and was attended by dozens of friends and family, including her young daughter who she hadn't seen for a number of years. Ms Wilkinson said: 'She had been searching for her little girl and she turned up. It was Hayley's dying wish to see her to see her little girl and she never got that. 'She had a lovely turnout for her funeral considering it all happened so quickly. 'It was beautiful. I asked everybody to wear something purple because it was Hayley's favourite colour.' Paul Grabham, 26, of Swansea, South Wales, murdered wife Kirsty, 24, after a violent drink and drug-fuelled row at their city flat in March 2009. He strangled her to death before attempting to chop her body in half, hiding it in a suitcase and dumping it beside the M4 near Bridgend. It was found nearly  a week after she was last seen by a lorry driver. A Swansea Crown Court jury took just five hours to find Grabham unanimously guilty of her murder at the end of a 15-day trial. The judge, Mr Justice Butterfield, angrily threatened to clear the court after family and friends of the victim shouted in triumph as the verdict was delivered. He jailed Grabham for life with a recommendation that he serve a minimum term of 19 years in prison. Paul Grabham (right) strangled his wife Kirsty and stuffed her body in a suitcase after a violent drink and drug-fuelled row in 2009. He was jailed for life after her body was found dumped next to the M4 in Wales . Passing sentence, Mr Justice Butterfield told Grabham that his actions had been 'cold and calculated' and without remorse. 'I have watched throughout this trial for the merest flicker of remorse in your eyes and I have seen none,' he told him. He added: 'You have been convicted of murder - just one year after you promised to love and cherish your new bride, you battered and strangled her to death. 'It was a vicious and sustained attack fuelled by drink and drugs that you had taken and it is without doubt that your intention was to kill her. 'But she was not to have, even in death, the decency and dignity to which, undoubtedly, she was entitled. 'You crammed her bleeding and still warm body into a suitcase like so much rubbish, hoping it would not be found for many years.' Grabham shoved his wife's battered body in a suitcase before dumping it by the side of the M4 in Bridgend . During the trial, Grabham insisted he had had nothing to do with his wife's violent murder. Despite evidence from neighbours detailing a violent two-hour argument they heard the couple having, he claimed it had never happened. Grabham returned early to the couple's flat on March 27 2009 after arguing with his wife at a Swansea nightclub. His wife came home in the early hours of the next day and was never seen again. Confronted with evidence showing her blood on his shoes and jeans and the walls and ceiling of their home, Grabham said he had no explanation for it. Asked why he had painted over areas of the walls and ceiling stained by his wife's blood, he simply said he had not. He maintained that he had come home drunk and was asleep on the sofa when his wife returned and left, never to be seen again. Kirsty was strangled to death by Grabham at their Swansea flat (pictured) in March 2009 following a row . When he got up the next day he surfed an online 'dogging' site looking for sex and in the afternoon visited a local brothel for sex. Two days after the murder he reported his wife missing and quickly became the key suspect in the police inquiry. After the verdict, Mrs Grabham's family praised the jury and thanked South Wales Police for bringing Grabham to justice.

"'Practice makes perfect', 'the grass is always greener on the other side' and 'good things come to those who wait' are just some of the words of wisdom given to people in childhood, which they still refer back to as adults. Of the 2,000 adults polled in the survey, which was carried out by children's charity NSPCC, 75 per cent  said they can still recount a piece of advice given to them in their early years. The research was carried out by the NSPCC to launch their mantra: every childhood is worth fighting for. The message of the research is that any adult can have a positive and lasting effect on a child's life. 'Practice makes perfect', 'the grass is always greener on the other side' and 'good things come to those who wait' were the top three most influential sayings we remember from childhood . 'Practice makes perfect' (63 per cent), 'treat others how you'd like to be treated' (62 per cent) and 'if at first you don't succeed try, try and try again' (54 per cent) were the top ten sayings adults remembered being taught by their parents. However, there were also a few old wives tales on the list with 'eat your crusts they'll make your hair curly' (26 per cent) and 'eating carrots will help you see in the dark' (30 per cent) also sneaking in. According to the research, parents are the biggest source of childhood wisdom (85 per cent), with grandparents (49 per cent) and teachers (28 per cent) also cited as sources of sage words. It seems these words of advice go full circle with 81 per cent of mums and 72 per cent of dads saying they use well-known expressions to teach their own children. Words of  wisdom go full circle: 81 per cent of mums and 72 per cent of dads say they use well-known expressions they learnt in childhood to teach their own children . 'Two wrongs don't make a right' (20 per cent) and 'it's not the winning, it's the taking part that counts' (17 per cent) were the two most commonly recited phrases by parents today. When quizzed on the maxims that respondents try to live their own lives by, almost half said 'treat others how you'd like to be treated', more than one in three cited 'manners cost nothing', a third quoted 'practice makes perfect' and 32 per cent chose 'if at first you don't succeed try, try and try again'. 1. Practice makes perfect (63 per cent) 2. Treat others how you'd like to be treated (62 per cent) 3. If at first you don't succeed try, try and try again (54 per cent) 4. Manners cost nothing (52 per cent) 5. You can't judge a book by its cover (45 per cent) 6. Good things come to those who wait (47 per cent) 7. Two wrongs don't make a right (41 per cent) 8. It's not the winning, it's the taking part that counts (38 per cent) 9. Never say never (37 per cent) 10. There's no time like the present (34 per cent) There were also gender differences. Women appeared more likely to practice patience – a quarter of the women polled said they live by 'good things come to those who wait' compared to just 14 per cent of men. Women were also shown to be slightly more empathetic than men when choosing their favourite words of wisdom with over half living by the phase 'treat others how you'd like to be treated', compared to 42 per cent of men. The NSPCC commissioned the research to help illustrate their message: childhood shapes who we become - but abuse never should. Celebrities, such as Stephen Fry, Alan Sugar, Piers Morgan, have all shared their own childhood words of wisdom using #childhoodwisdom. Other celebrities to join the trend include actress Gemma Atkinson and Radio 1 DJ Matt Edmondson. Gemma tweeted: 'Being told to drink lots of water. Dad told me it'd make me strong like a lion. Random but I always remember it', under the hashtag. '""Think like a dog"" (i.e. live in the moment!)', was Matt's tweet. Peter Wanless, CEO of the NSPCC, said: 'We're entering a fresh phase in the NSPCC's 130-year history. 'We want to show how actions that all of us can take, help ensure children's experiences are positive and one way of doing this is to impart words of wisdom. 'Abuse robs children of a happy childhood but it doesn't have to be that way.'

Among the many people who travelled to the City to welcome him in was his predecessor Fiona Woolf - who resigned this week after days of intense pressure over her links to Leon Brittan. Mrs Woolf, a solicitor, stepped down as London's Lord Mayor hours after victims’ groups said she was unsuitable to run the inquiry into historic child abuse - which would be ‘a dead duck in the water’ if she remained.

The Lord Mayor heads the City of London Corporation, which oversees the Square Mile. It is the only local government authority in Britain whose members are elected predominantly by voters appointed by businesses. The position was introduced by King John in 1215 in a bid to win support from the City by giving it the right to elect its own mayor. Originally, after being elected, the new Lord Mayor would travel by river to Westminster, to pledge allegiance to the sovereign - but the procession ceased to become waterborne in 1856. Many livery companies had got rid of their barges and the Thames was not in a good state, so the procession transferred to the land. It was only revived last year. Outgoing Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf is only the second woman in eight centuries to take the position, while the incoming Lord Mayor is Alan Yarrow, a member of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and a career banker. He assumed the position yesterday and was sworn in at the Silent Ceremony at the Guildhall - so-called because the only words uttered are the Lord Mayor’s oath.

"Less than 24 hours after her embarrassing performance in a U.S. Senate debate, Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes will have to finish her race against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell without advertising dollars from her party's most aggressive campaign war chest. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has not placed any orders for commercial time there between now and Election Day, sending a message that the party is leaving Grimes, the Kentucky secretary of state, to fend for herself. No DSCC ads are running today in the Bluegrass State. Grimes brought national eye-rolls last week when she refused to say in a newspaper editorial board meeting whether she had voted for President Barack Obama, and doubled down on that position in the debate – citing the 'sanctity of the ballot box.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is beaming after his opponent's biggest outside contributor has turned off its advertising-money spigot . Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes said Monday – for the second time in a week – that she won't disclose who she voted for in the last two presidential elections . White House spokesman Josh Earnest could barely contain his laughter on Tuesday as reporters quizzed him about Grimes and her reluctance to support Obama. 'I'll tell you that I voted for the president.' he offered . 'I'm not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in Kentucky in order to curry favor on one or [an]other side,' she insisted. Reviews were not kind, and the DSCC has thrown in the towel. 'The DSCC has now spent more than $2 million in Kentucky and continues to make targeted investments in the ground game while monitoring the race for future investments, but is currently not on the air in the state,' a DSCC official said in a statement. Grimes' campaign has continued to air its own ads, according to the Associated Press, including one that claims McConnell supports amnesty for 3 million immigrants living in the country illegally – an accusation whose weight usually falls on Democrats. Until Monday night's debate, the DSCC had maintained a constant presence on TV and radio, bashing McConnell . But the five-term senator has managed to eke out a consistent lead in opinion surveys, averaging a 3 point lead in the latest Real Clear Politics average of polls. The Democratic Party is trying to cling to enough seats to retain its control of the U.S. Senate. Republicans need to flip just six to emerge in charge of both houses of Congress. The DSCC is moving its Kentucky ad dollars to Georgia, where GOP nominee David Perdue is in a tight race with Democrat Michelle Nunn, the daughter of long-time liberal pol Sam Nunn. Attack ads in that race are focusing on an old court deposition in which Perdue conceded putting time and energy behind a business strategy to 'outsource' jobs overseas. Its GOP counterpart, the NRSC, has just announced a $7.4 million increase in ad buys in South Dakota, Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa and New Hampshire. On Tuesday at the White House, press secretary Josh Earnest could barely stifle a laugh when a journalist asked him about Grimes' unwillingness to stand behind her party's president. 'A Clinton Democrat': Grimes was a Hillary Clinton delegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention, but came back to the event four years later pledged to support Obama's renomination . Trouble ahead: Grimes is 3 points down in the polls and McConnell's war chest shows all signs of being solid in the remaining few weeks before Election Day . 'Well, I don't know,' Earnest told reporters. 'I've seen some of the news reports about her campaign, but I don't know.' 'I'll tell you that I voted for the president.' he offered. Minutes later another reporter needled Earnest with a question about whether he believes he'violated the sanctity of the ballot box by telling us who you voted for.' Grimes, a polished statewide office-holder, had been seen as the most credible challenge to McConnell since he was first elected to the Senate during the Reagan administration. Democrats first floated the idea of running actress Ashley Judd, but that idea fizzled after Bill and Hillary Clinton announced that they were backing Grimes instead. Grimes has said repeatedly that she is a 'Clinton Democrat'  but refused several times in recent days to say whether she voted for President Obama in the last two general elections. She was a Democratic National Convention delegate for Hillary in 2008 but was pledged to Obama in 2012. As a foundering strategy against the ISIS terror army and a Keystone-Kops approach to the Ebola crisis have shortened Obama's coattails, few midterm election candidates from his own party have been willing to welcome him on the campaign stump. McConnell seized on that discontent, turning his contest with Grimes into a referendum on the president – whose pallid popularity levels are lower than McConnell's.","Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes has refused to say if she voted for the increasingly unpopular President Barack Obama .

"Republicans grabbed three Democratic-held Senate seats early on Tuesday evening,scoring victories in West Virginia, South Dakota and Arkansas. The most notable was freshman Rep. Tom Cotton, who knocked off two-term Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor in Arkansas. This despite the fact the Sen. Pryor received several visits from the state's most famous politician, former president Bill Clinton, who swung down to repeatedly stump for the incumbent. Lost cause: Even the support of former president Bill Clinton (left) could not help Democrat incumbent Mary Pryor from Arkansas, who lost in a landslide on Tuesday . Big win: Rep. Tom Cotton (above) of Arkansas, who defeated Sen. Pryor after receiving almost 57% of the vote to Pryor's 40%, celebrates with his supporters Tuesday evening . In the end, he lost in a landslide, receiving a little over 40% of the vote, as opposed to the nearly 57% received by Rep. Cotton. Republicans also easily replaced retiring Democratic senators in West Virginia and South Dakota. The support of Hillary Clinton proved to be even more toxic to some campaigns it would seem, with six of the candidates endorsed by the woman many believe could be this country's next president losing. They include Alison Lundergan Grimes from Kentucky, Kaya Hagan from North Carolina, Mark Udall in Colorado, Bruce Braley in Iowa and Michelle Nunn in Georgia, who were all running for U.S. Senate. Hillary Clinton saw all her work stumping for Senate hopefuls yield no real results, as most lost, including Bruce Braley in Iowa . Kay Hagan lost in North Carolina . Alison Lundergan Grimes lost in Kentucky . She also stumped for Anthony Brown, who lost his bid to be governor of Maryland. As expected, GOP Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia won the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller. And former Gov. Mike Rounds of South Dakota won retiring Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson's seat. McConnell, of Kentucky, won a sixth term of his own, and immediately warned Obama of coming confrontations. Mark Udall lost in Colorado . No luck: Hillary Clinton's support of Maryland governor hopeful Anthony Brown (above) did not lead to a victory for the current Lieutenant Governor of that state . Michelle Nunn lost in Georgia . 'For too long, this administration has tried to tell the American people what's good for them and then blame somebody else when their policies didn't work out,' McConnell told cheering fans. McConnell and Cotton, an Iraq combat veteran and Harvard Law School graduate, joined virtually every other Republican nationwide in relentlessly linking their opponent to the president whose popularity has sagged. Pryor, the last Democrat in Arkansas' congressional delegation, is the son of a popular former governor and senator. But Arkansas and West Virginia have been trending sharply Republican. Obama lost Arkansas by 24 percentage points in 2012. Dejected incumbent: Sen. Pryor (above) delivers his concession speech to supporters on Tuesday . Winner: Republican candidate for the U.S Senate from West Virginia, Shelley Moore Capito, celebrates her victory with supporters . In Kentucky, Democrats once had high hopes for challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, the state's young secretary of state. But the hill was too steep in a state Obama lost by 23 percentage points in 2012. McConnell's allies taunted Grimes for refusing to say whether she had voted for Obama. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rounds of South Dakota campaigns with supporters during the morning commute in Sioux Falls . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is joined by his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, as they celebrate with his supporters at an election night party in Louisville, Kentucky . Republicans also celebrated Sen. Tim Scott becoming the first black elected to the Senate from a former Confederate state since Reconstruction. He was appointed to the Senate last year, and won a term of his own Tuesday. Democrats privately said they hoped to limit their net Senate losses to five seats, which would barely keep them in control, but they failed to do so.","Republicans continue to pick up U.S. Senate seats in the midterm elections, gaining key victories in South Dakota, West Virginia and Arkansas .

"Of course you love them, but you’d probably rather not travel large distances with them. Children and babies are probably the most stressful additions to any journey. They kick and scream and cry and complain and repeat the cycle at varying volumes until you reach your destination. While there’s little you can do solve the problem in its entirety - save leave them behind - there are a few things you can do to prevent some of the worst tantrums and forearm yourself for the open road. Scroll down for video . Happy families: Travelling with children is hellish but there are things you can do to prevent the worst tantrums . 1.) Book seats by the plane’s engine . Who’d have guessed it? One of the best things to rock-a-bye-baby is the roar of an engine. According to The Art of Manliness, who swear by the tip given to them by from an experienced air stewardess, although the engine is loud; ‘the womb was incredibly loud too – and they’ll think they’re back in their happy place.’ As an engine’s location varies from plane to plane  you’ll need to find out what type of plane you are flying in then use Google to see where that aircraft’s engines are located before choosing your seat. Out for the count: Choose a seat that's close to the plane's engine if travelling with a baby to make them sleep . 2.) Surprise present . TV presenter and consumer champion Sarah Willingham has a useful trick to stem the bawling if you’re little one has past the point of no return. Before you get into the car/train/plane secretly wrap up one of their favourite toys without telling them. At the right moment hand it over for them to unwrap. It can't fail to make them smile and will calm them down quickly. Surprise surprise: Secretly wrap up your child's favourite toy and present them with it to calm them down . 3.) Do your homework . There are a few sites such as Skyscanner and Seat Guru which can keep you abreast of unexpected charges, requirements or rules when flying with a baby or child. Some airlines such as easyjet and Aer Lingus give free priority boarding with an infant under two, some let you carry on pushchairs and car seats free of charge. Find out which. Seatguru is especially good for detailed information about amenities such as bassinets, whether you have to reserve a separate seat for your baby and what type of car seats are allowed on board. Disclaimer: This is a model family, it's highly unlikely you will ever look as happy as them in an airport unless you take careful precautions . Sites such as Skyscanner and Seat Guru help keep you abreast of unexpected charges, requirements or rules . 4.) Sit at the back . If you can’t sit near the engine, sit at the back of the plane. As Sara Esther Crispe, co-director of Interinclusion.org and mother-of-four writes on The Jewish Woman, you'll be closer to the bathrooms, less likely to bother other passengers and possibly have more help from flight attendants. You're going to have to wait for the push chair or stroller when you get off the plane anyway. Back is best: You'll be closer to the bathrooms, less likely to annoy others and be closer to flight attendents . Careful planning: Follow these tips and you might just make it to your destination without falling to pieces . 5.) Get a travel jacket . Imagine Bear Grylls circumnavigating  Borneo's rainforest in Southeast Asia. That's the jacket you need to buy. According to The Art of Manliness, you’ll need all sorts of accouterments - from sweets to pens and paper and tissues -  to placate the small ones and a purpose built travel jacket, with its many, many pockets, means you can easily access them at any time. Plus, it doubles as a blanket if they get cold. Just ensure it’s lightweight so you can fold it up and stow it in your luggage when not needed. Be prepared: Buy an unattractive but practical jacket which has room for supplies and doubles up as a blanket . 6.) Book the shortest route . While this isn’t rocket science, if you have a multi-leg trip involving train changes or more than one flight it’s key to plan with military precision. Sites like kayak.com can sort results into travel time so you can choose the faster route. Equally, if you do have to have a stopover, leave at least an hour for children to stretch their legs, attack each other and have something to eat. If you have a stopover ensure you leave  an hour for young ones to stretch, eat and get rid of some energy . Pack one of everything: Prevent fights over who wants to use the blue crayon by giving everyone their own set . 7.) Pack one of everything . It will save countless arguments. Give each child their own version of everything that’s practical too. This is especially important with crayons, according to Sara Esther Crispe. If they have their own pack they won’t fight over the best colours and you’ll have a better journey. Take one spare change of clothes for everyone and at least one plastic bag per person, which you will use for everything from rubbish and cleaning up disasters to emergency bags and keeping things dry after spillages.","Choose a seat next to a plane's engine to soothe and help children sleep .

"A dog-mad entrepreneur has opened a new restaurant where dogs and their owners are served as equals. Dog lovers and their four-legged friends can enjoy a spot of lunch together at Cardiff's The Doggy Deli and Barkery. Owner Leanne Couch, 29, said: 'We definitely see our customers and their dogs as equals, they're one and the same. The Doggie Deli and Barkery in Cardiff is the brainchild of dog-mad entrepreneur Leanne Couch . Mrs Couch and her dog Lucy. The 29-year-old's restaurant caters to hounds and humans . 'I wanted to create a space where dog owners could come and relax with each other. 'Most diners don't want dogs running around, bothering the customers. At our doggy diner, we love the dogs and we only really want dog lovers coming in. While human customers can tuck into a cup of tea with a homemade cupcake, their doggy dinner dates can be spoiled with a wagguccino - a big bowl of frothy milk - with sausages or special dog-friendly cakes. Happy customers: Two four-legged customers greet each other on their doggy date . A customer with her pet pooch. The restaurant is a place where owners and their dogs can relax together . The hounds menu includes raw peanut butter pup-cakes, doggy beer, and Bill + Margot dog ice-cream . Other items on the hounds menu include doggy beer (Barkers Brew' beef and chicken), raw peanut butter pup-cakes and Billy + Margot dog ice-cream. Humans customers are also offered a selection of muffins and bagels as well as teacakes and scones. The restaurant also offers special doggy birthday cakes edged with biscuit bones for four-legged parties. 'It is probably one of my best ideas yet,' said Mrs Couch. The recently opened doggy diner was so popular on its first day that Mrs Couch needed to bring in extra staff . Who's a good boy: The restaurant offers special doggy birthday cakes edged with biscuit bones for parties . 'There is such an amazing atmosphere - while the dogs eat their sausages and cakes and drink their wagguccinos, their owners sit around socialising. 'It's calm and natural - the complete opposite of a usual pet-led activity. People can just drop their dogs off and chill while their dogs ran around playing with each other.' The recently opened doggy diner experienced such a rush on its first day that Mrs Couch needed to bring in extra staff to help wash up. 'I wasn't prepared. Luckily I had lots of help but we were absolutely swamped with customers. 'It was overwhelming. I'm finding it hard to sleep at the moment with the excitement of it all,' Mrs Couch continued. The Doggy Deli and Barkery in Crwys Road, Cardiff is not the first of its kind in the UK. That distinction goes to London's first dog cafe, Scooby's Boutique Coffee Bar in Muswell Hill, which opened its doors in January this year.","The Doggy Deli and Barkery in Cardiff first establishment of its kind in Wales .

"A Russian thief nicknamed ‘The Strangler’ after he suffocated and robbed 20 female victims, has been revealed as a travel agent who claims he stole to pay his staff. Khamzat Nemtsov, 53, ran a local holiday agency in St Petersburg, and had been known for his friendly approach and was well-liked in the area. However, his company has been losing business to online rivals, and in order to stay afloat, Nemtsov turned into a prowling stalker, strangling and robbing vulnerable women, Russian police have said. Scroll down for video . Attack: Khamzat Nemtsov was caught on CCTV as he attacked a female victim in St Petersburg . Nemtsov would roam the streets of St Petersburg after locking up his travel agency, and pounce on a lonely woman. He would put his victims in a head lock and suffocated them until they fell unconscious before making off with their valuables. A police spokesman said: ‘He began to develop his very own unique modus operandi, which was particularly distressing for the victims. ‘He would casually approach them from behind and then put them in a head lock and choke them until they dropped. ‘When they came round they would be dazed, terrified and missing their valuables.’ Chilling: Nemtsov can be seen putting a woman in a head lock and suffocating her until she falls unconcious . Two-faced: By day, Nemtsov was a friendly local travel agent, and by night he robbed lonely women . Robbery: The woman can be seen fighting for her life, as she battles with the 53-year-old travel agent . After police released the video  they were inundated with calls from locals who recognised Nemtsov . But after a string of 20 robberies, Nemtsov was finally caught after chilling CCTV footage revealed his face. The grainy images show a young woman walking into the front door of her apartment block and Nemtsov quickly stepping in before it shuts behind her. He then grabs the unsuspecting woman's head and puts her into a vice-like headlock. After a few moments of desperate struggling the woman finally sinks to her knees semi-unconscious before he grabs her handbag and runs out of the door. Police released the video and were soon flooded with calls from locals who recognised him as their friendly tourist agent. CCTV shows Nemtsov going through her pockets before grabbing her handbag and rushing off . Heartless: The woman lies on the floor unconscious while Nemtsov runs off with her posessions . Horror: The woman wakes up after Nemtsov has run off, but the CCTV of the attack led to his identification . Local man Ruslan Butusov, 35, said: ‘I used his agency a couple of times and he was always very friendly and helpful. ‘I don't think anyone had any idea that he was The Strangler that everyone had been talking about.’ A police spokesman said: ‘Once identified it was very easy to track him down and when questioned he confessed saying he had done it because he needed money to clear his debts and pay his staff.’ Nemtsov said: ‘I couldn't face the thought of losing the business I had worked for all my life, and telling my staff I had failed them.’ The spokesman added that when officers raided his flat they found among the discarded handbags and purses two Mosin bolt-action rifles and more than twenty bullets. The man has been remanded in custody and now faces charges of robbery, ABH, and illegal possession of firearms.","Khamzat Nemtsov, 53, was a travel agent by day and robber by night .

"Most people know that feeling of dread when something they use every day breaks. Do you attempt to repair it, using up precious time, or just give up and replace it, wasting precious money? Or, as these DIY disasters show, you could use up neither time nor money and instead opt for the quick-fix solution by repairing the item using whatever is to hand. Broken chair leg? No problem, simply prop it up with an empty Jack Daniels bottle. Lost your pizza cutter? Nothing that a ruler and a tin lid can't fix. From the weird, to the wonderful, to the downright dangerous, these images show what happens when broken objects fall into the hands of the chronically lazy. What time is it..? Time for a new clock: Instead of replacing this broken timepiece, some genius decided to draw the missing numbers on paper and stick them to the wall . That sinking feeling: While this bathroom sink is in desperate need of some screws to stop it falling off the wall, a stack of books and an old chair will have to do for now . Driving me spare: After suffering a puncture, this have-a-go motorist has attempted to fix his car by putting a child's cart underneath the rear wheel . Budget birthday: With no candles to hand, this lucky birthday girl had to make do with a cigarette stuck into the top of her cake .

"A house that was destroyed by fire is set to sell at auction for over $650,000, with the real estate agent describing the home as the 'cheapest' property on the market in Sydney's Inner West. Owner Tom Noicos, 54, is being forced to sell his St Peters home after his housemate allegedly lit it on fire and his insurance company rejected his claim because the fire was allegedly lit deliberately. The Block's auctioneer Damien Cooley has signed on to draw more interest to the property, after he heard the 'sad story' and wanted to help. Scroll down for video . This fire-damaged house in St Peters in Sydney's Inner West is set to sell for over $650,000 at auction . The house was partially destroyed when owner Tom Noicos's housemate allegedly set fire to his bedroom . The three-bedroom freestanding brick home is being advertised as presenting a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for renovators, builders and savvy investors alike to capitalise on this highly sought after piece of Inner West real estate'. Mr Noicos, 54, is being forced to sell the home because his insurance claim was rejected . 'The entry reveals dramatic fire damage to the hallway and first bedroom with only mostly smoke soot through the remaining rooms of the house,' the ad reads. Mr Noicos, a former IT worker,  has owned the house for about 12 years and lived there with his former housemate, 55, until a year ago. In August he let his former friend, who cannot be named, come stay with him for a week because 'he had nowhere else to go'. 'I lost everything,' Mr Noicos told Daily Mail Australia. 'I try to do the right thing and I get this.' Mr Noicos said he had not had any disagreements with his former friend of almost 20 years on the day of the incident. 'Everything was fine, in fact he drove me to the doctor in the morning and said ring me when you finish up and I'll come pick you up,' he said. 'I kept ringing and there was no answer, so I got a taxi home and had to face police, ambulances and fire brigades putting out my house.' Afterwards his insurance company NRMA Insurance put him up in an apartment in the city but two weeks ago they rejected his claim. 'Their reason being that I gave him permission to be in the house', Mr Noicos said, and the man allegedly lit it deliberately. 'But I'm like, I didn't give him permission to light the fire! 'It's been a very bad experience for me… I'm trying to appeal the decision because I don't think it's fair.' The Block's auctioneer Damien Cooley has signed on to draw more interest to the property, after he heard the 'sad story' and wanted to help . Real estate agent Santos Sulfaro said since Richardson & Wrench Leichhardt posted the property ad at midday on Monday his phone had been ringing off the hook . Police said a 55-year-old man is due to appear in Central Local Court on December 1, charged with contravening an apprehended violence order and damaging a property by fire. Mr Noicos can't afford to stay in the apartment, or pay to fix the damage to his St Peters home, so he has decided to sell. Real estate agency Richardson & Wrench Leichhardt are enlisting Damien Cooley from The Block to conduct the auction on November 22 in order to draw more interest. Mr Cooley said it was a sad story and he wanted to help Mr Noicos get a good result. 'You don't like these things come to people, and it's by no fault of his own, so I thought it was a good thing to be involved in,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Cooley said he had been involved in the sale of derelict and damaged homes in the past but this was that worst one he'd seen 'for quite some time'. Te house features a mix of old and new features, including a renovated kitchen, bathroom and laundry . Mr Sulfaro said the fire damage was contained to the front four metres of the home, but the rest of the house was covered in soot . 'In some respects it looks a lot worse than it really is,' he said. 'The smoke damage gives it the feeling that the whole house is in wrack and ruin.' Real estate agent Santos Sulfaro said since Richardson & Wrench posted the property ad at midday on Monday his phone had been ringing off the hook. 'It's had quite a lot of interest from people curious about the price range and what the possibilities are,' Mr Sulfaro told Daily Mail Australia. 'We're looking at above $650,000, but prior to the fire it easily would have achieved $950,000.' Mr Sulfaro said the fire damage was contained to the front four metres of the home. 'If it was someone from a building background they could fix it up easily for $80-$100,000,' he said. 'For someone else with no building background it could cost up to $150,000, but still even at that price there's a lot of hard work involved that's not going to cost you a lot of money. Mr Sulfaro said the air-conditioning ducts and electrical wiring would also need to be replaced . The house also has its original timber floors and high metal press ornate ceilings . 'Most of the house is covered in smoke soot and that might just take a few weekends there with a bit of elbow grease to get rid of.' Mr Sulfaro said the air-conditioning ducts and electrical wiring would also need to be replaced. He added that the house featured a mix of old and new features, including a renovated kitchen, bathroom and laundry, original timber floors and high metal press ornate ceilings. Mr Sulfaro said under normal circumstances in St Peters $650,000 would get a homebuyer a modern one-bedroom apartment with a car space. 'I think this is probably the cheapest property on the market in the Inner West,' he said. 'I don't think you can get better value and I haven't seen better value all year.' Prior to the fire the house  would have easily sold for $950,000, the real estate agent said . Mr Sulfaro said under normal circumstances in St Peters $650,000 would get a homebuyer a modern one-bedroom apartment with a car space . An NRMA Insurance spokeswoman said in a statement: 'Mr. Noicos' home was damaged by a fire that was determined by Police to have been deliberately lit by Mr. Noicos' housemate. 'Because the fire was lit by a person authorised by Mr. Noicos to live in his home, his claim was declined in accordance with a general exclusion in his policy, listed in the product disclosure statement.' NRMA said it  reviewed his claim and maintained its decision to decline it. 'We have provided him with a further option for the matter to be escalated,' the spokeswoman said. 'Alternatively, he can take the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service, or seek legal advice.' NRMA added that it doesn't cover any intentional act or omission by 'you, your family or someone who lives in your home — for example, the tenants' or 'someone who acts with your or your family's consent, or the consent of someone who lives in your home'.","Tom Noicos, 54, is being forced to sell his home in St Peters in Sydney .

"This was the spectacular sight over Fistral Beach in Newquay today, as a double rainbow appeared to rise out of the sea and arch over the seaside town. The stunning picture, taken this morning, was taken shortly after a sudden shower on the Cornish beach, which is popular with surfers even during the colder months. The rain is likely to be the last seen in the south-west for the next few days, with forecasters predicting clear skies but freezing temperatures through to Bonfire Night. A spectacular rainbow appeared to rise from the sea in Newquay, Cornwall, today, arching its way over the seaside town . Another rainbow was seen over Aberystwyth, west Wales, today, as wet and windy weather returned to the town . There was an equally stunning view over Windermere in the Lake District this morning, as the sun painted the sky a mural of reds and oranges . Walkers braved the rain at Friars Cliff in Dorset as they strolled past the beach's colourful huts, but clearer skies are expected tomorrow, according to the Met Office . A family walks across a pebbly bay at Highcliffe, Dorset, as wet and stormy weather battered the beach.

Overnight showers will ease tomorrow morning with clear skies expected for most of the country, other than a few brief showers in the north-west and Wales, the Met Office said. Freezing temperatures will accompany the blue skies, however, with frosts predicted for the north of England and swathes of Scotland. Forecasters said the weather would be great for watching fireworks, but warned people planning on going out on Bonfire Night to wrap up warm. A Met Office spokesman said: 'There will be fewer showers and clear spells from tomorrow morning so temperatures may drop to 5C in towns and cities. 'There will be the odd shower in the north-west and Wales, but the best weather will be seen in the east of the country. 'Temperatures in Scotland will drop tomorrow evening and freezing temperatures are expected. These cold temperatures will be particularly felt in higher areas.

"A dramatic new video captures the moment Canadian gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau arrived at Parliament yesterday. The Muslim convert is seen jumping out of his car while holding a gun as terrified bystanders frantically free from the man, who had just killed Corporal Nathan Cirillo at the National War Memorial and would be shot dead himself just minutes later. The video was released by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in a news conference where it was also revealed that the troubled 32-year-old may have been a dual citizen with Libya and that police have found no connection between yesterday's incident and one on Monday where a Muslim convert also killed a solider. Scroll down for video . Terror: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau is seen above as he runs toward the Parliament building holding a gun . Driving in: The video, which was obtained with closed circuit video, also shows the gunman pulling up in his car . Different look: Zehaf-Bibeau (above) looks much different in this high school yearbook photo . That man, who was described by authorities as 'radicalized,' hit and killed a solider with his car before being shot dead. Commissioner Bob Paulson described Zehaf-Bibeau as a Canadian-born petty criminal before showing the video and acknowledging his possible dual Libyan citizenship. Zehaf-Bibeau's father, Bulgasem Zehaf, was a Libyan citizen. It was also revealed that the young man was not on the watch list of 90 Canadians known as 'high-risk travelers' to the Canadian security forces, this despite earlier reports to the contrary. Briefing: RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson (left) and Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau (right) speak about the shooting at the National War Memorial at a press conference at the RCMP Headquarters in Ottawa . Getting away: Terrified bystanders can be seen fleeing as Zehaf-Bibeau pulls up in his car (circled in white) at Parliament . Their investigation shows the young man arrived in Ottawa on October 2, to deal with securing a new passport, something his friends seem to back up in their statements about the young man. 'The passport was part of his motivation. His application was not rejected. His passport was not revoked,' said Paulson. 'He was waiting to get it and there was an investigation going on to determine to see whether he would get a passport.' Reckless: The car is seen speeding towards Parliament in this still . Running: Here, Zehaf-Bibeau is running toward the building . Abubakir Abdelkareem, 29, who often visited the Ottawa Mission, a homeless shelter downtown, said he met Zehaf-Bibeau there. He said Zehaf-Bibeau told him he had a drug problem in Vancouver but had been clean for three months. Abdelkareem said that Zehaf-Bibeau wanted his passport to fly to Libya because he thought he could avoid drugs there. 'As soon as I get it, I'm going to fly. ... Then there's no temptation,' Abdelkareem quoted him as saying. But in the past three days, 'his personality changed completely,' Abdelkareem said. 'He was not talkative; he was not social' anymore and slept during the day, said Abdelkareem, who concluded the man was back on drugs. Lloyd Maxwell, another shelter resident, said that Zehaf-Bibeau had lived for some time in Vancouver, then Calgary, then came to Ottawa specifically to try to get a passport, believing that would be more easily accomplished in the nation's capital. 'He didn't get it, and that made him very agitated,' Maxwell said. Maxwell said that he suggested to the man that he might be on a no-fly list, and 'he kind of looked at me funny, and he walked away.' Last look: The final shot of Zihaf-Bibeau, holding his gun which can clearly be seen, as he runs into Parliament . Back to his old ways: Friends have said they believed Zehaf-Bibeau (above) was using drugs again after recently trying to kick the habit . The Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed on Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had applied recently for a passport, but said it believes he intended to go to Syria. Earlier this week, the Mounties said that there are about 90 people in the country who are suspected of intending to join the extremist fighting abroad or who have returned from such activity overseas. But RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau was not among them. Expressing horror and sadness at what happened, Zehaf-Bibeau's mother, Susan Bideau, said that her son seemed lost and 'did not fit in,' and that she hadn't seen him for more than five years until having lunch with him last week. 'So I have very little insight to offer,' she said. Bibeau also said that she is crying for the victims of the shooting rampage, not her son. 'Can you ever explain something like this?' said Bibeau, who has homes in Montreal and Ottawa. 'We are sorry.' Remebering: Flags in Canada flew at half mast today to mark the tragedy . Sad dogs: Two melancholy canines are seen peeking out from under the gate at the  home of Corporal Nathan Cirillo . Fallen solider: People have left flowers and Canadian flags at the home of the man, who was killed by Zehaf-Bibeau while guarding the National War Memorial . After initially reporting that two or three assailants may have taken part in the shooting rampage, Canadian police conceded Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau was the lone gunman. The bloodshed raised fears that Canada is suffering reprisals — perhaps so-called lone-wolf attacks — for joining the U.S.-led air campaign against Islamic State extremists in Iraq and Syria.","Michael Zehaf-Bibeau is seen exiting and car and waving his gun as he runs into Parliament in a newly released video .

"There is a real danger of Sergio Aguero becoming the Premier League’s greatest striker of all-time if he manages to maintain a freak minutes-per-goal record which even tops Thierry Henry. The Manchester City man scored the only goal in Sunday’s derby win against rivals United – meaning he now notches once every 109 minutes. It was Aguero’s 62nd in the league for City – and 10th this season – and puts him ahead of Henry, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Alan Shearer. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has netted 62 Premier League goals in 6783 minutes in England . Sergio Aguero converts Gael Clichy's low cross from the left to put Manchester City 1-0 ahead in the derby . Aguero (second from left) is mobbed by his team-mates after giving the hosts the lead against Man United . Thierry Henry is widely-regarded as one of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League . Not only that, the 26-year-old is comfortably in front of every other frontman to have lit up the top flight since 1992. Henry – Arsenal’s main man for eight years – netted 175 times in 237 Premier League games. Widely-regarded as a revolutionary in the modern era, Henry’s capability of scoring 20-a-season in double-quick time put him on a pedestal as the best there had been. Even superior to Shearer, who ended his career with more, 260, but took longer in between strikes to find the net. Van Nistelrooy’s trailblazing four campaigns at Manchester United – ignoring the injury-ravaged first – garnered 95 goals at a rate of one every 128 minutes. Robin van Persie’s strike rate is healthy at 137 minutes per goal, while the year spent in England by Samuel Eto’o had proved profitable – his 12 goals coming in 1609 minutes. Manchester United skipper Wayne Rooney, on the other hand, has taken 168 minutes for each of his 176 in the Premier League. That isn’t a record to be sniffed at. It comes in at better than a goal every other game if purely using minutes. Aguero’s 109 minutes for every strike – which is half-an-hour more impressive than Luis Suarez and Edin Dzeko – makes him the most lethal marksman to have graced English football. Henry comfortably finishes past Bolton Wanderers goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen in an FA Cup tie . Aguero has a better minutes-per-goal ratio than ex-Liverpool talisman Luis Suarez (celebrating at Norwich) Alan Shearer's goals were crucial in Blackburn winning the 1995 Premier League title (Chris Sutton right) Detractors may point to the City striker’s injury record – he always struggles to get through a full campaign without tweaking something – as reason enough to suggest he can never be named No 1. But even last year, when Aguero spent two months on the sidelines, he was up there with Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. His manager Manuel Pellegrini said last December that this season’s top scorer was a better player than the Uruguayan. ‘Suarez is a very important striker, but I think Sergio participates more in the game,’ Pellegrini claimed. ‘He has always been a top player and he has always scored goals, but I think at this moment, he has added working for the team without the ball, which is also important for him.’ Shearer scored 260 Premier League goals, most marked with his trademark celebration . The bustling centre forward often notched from the penalty spot but got plenty from open play . Wayne Rooney is in the top 25 but his record is worse than the likes of Robin van Persie and Javier Hernandez . The Chilean certainly isn’t wrong – Aguero contributes so much more – but it is for his goalscoring that he will be remembered most fondly for. There was never any danger of Gael Clichy’s centre not ending up nestled beyond David de Gea at the Etihad Stadium this weekend. It is that sort of clinical finishing that sets him apart. He rarely needs more than one chance. While Aguero offers much more across the width of a pitch and in behind defenders, there are a number of players who have merely relied on their prowess in front of goal to retain a spot in the upper echelons of this all-time Premier League list. Javier Hernandez, now at Real Madrid, was renowned for doing very little in United games before a ball broke inside the opposition penalty area, while Adam Le Fondre – whose record is only topped by Henry and Aguero – has forever been an impact substitute. Ivan Klasnic's goalscoring record while at Bolton puts him among the Premier League's elite . Tony Yeboah (pictured scoring for Leeds against Liverpool in 1995) scored picture-book goals . Reading used Adam Le Fondre as a super sub - but his minutes-per-goal ratio was exemplary . Ole Gunnar Solskjaer often saved Manchester United late on in games after being called from the bench . Shearer was chief penalty taker wherever he played, while Ivan Klasnic’s 20 Bolton goals tended to come in gluts (and often from the bench) before Owen Coyle sent him packing. Unsurprisingly, both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Owen feature, although their records of a goal every 150 minutes might have been better if the pair didn’t spend so much time coming back from injuries. Derby’s Branko Strupar makes the list, but his four years at Pride Park from 1999 actually only brought about 15 goals, with Tony Yeboah’s record slightly more impressive. Of the current crop to surprise, Andre Schurrle and Wilfried Bony both make the top 25. Whether Aguero’s record can be beaten remains to be seen, but it looks doubtful.","Manchester City striker pips Thierry Henry in the charts .

"A woman claims the air conditioning in her office helped save her life after she discovered a lump in her breast as she hugged herself to keep warm. Elaine Delaney, from Hackney, London, had always complained about the air con being on, even in the middle of winter. Now she credits it with saving her life, after it alerted her to the tumour last December. The 35-year-old, said: 'It was a freezing cold morning and the air-con was on full blast. I think it was colder in the office than outside. Elaine Delaney, 35, had a cast of her new chest created after losing both her breasts to cancer (right). Before she was diagnosed (left) she found a lump but thought she was too young to get breast cancer . Ms Delaney discovered the lump after her hugging herself to try and warm up in her air conditioned office and now credits the air con with saving her life . After a double mastectomy, Ms Delaney found out she couldn't have reconstructive surgery until it was certain she was cancer-free. She says she struggled to accept her new body . Ms Delaney celebrated her 34th birthday with friends days before she found a lump in her breast that turned out to be cancerous . 'I hugged myself to try and keep warm and felt a small grisly lump about the size of a grape. 'After asking a colleague to examine it, I decided to mention it to my doctor at a check-up I'd booked for something else three days later.' The office manager, who also volunteers for homeless charity Crisis, took her mother Stella, 70, who is also a breast cancer survivor, along with her for support. While she was aware of the history of cancer in her family, having just celebrated her 34th birthday Ms Delaney thought she was too young for the lump to be anything serious. But by the time of her appointment, the lump in her left breast had swollen to the size of a golf ball and the GP also found a smaller growth in her right breast. 'I was sent to hospital for scans and it was then I started to worry,' she said. 'Mum had been diagnosed with breast cancer five years earlier so I knew what could be ahead.' GETTING STARTED . Start with a visual exam. Look in the mirror with your arms over your head and then with your hands on your hips being sure to check both the front of your breasts as well as the sides and ask yourself: Do my breasts look the same? Are my nipples the same shape? Are there any indentions, bruises or bulges? Is there any discharge coming from my nipples? Are the veins more noticeable on one breast than the other? STEP 1 . Next, lie down on your back with one hand behind your head. This flattens the breast tissue against the chest wall and makes it easier to evaluate. Use the pads of your three middle fingers from your opposite hand to examine each breast. STEP 2 . Move your three fingers in penny-sized circles. Do three circles in one spot, starting with light pressure, then medium and lastly use deeper pressure. Now 'walk' your fingers to the next area. Do not lift your fingers off your breast, 'walk' them to the next spot. STEP 3 . Starting at your breast bone, work your way down your breast and back covering your entire chest. Continue to do penny-sized circles, moving into the armpit area continuing all the way into the inside of your arm. Your last line will be up your side just below the outer edge of your breast, finishing on the inside of your armpit. STEP 4 . Be sure to spend extra time in the armpit. It's important to go all the way to the inner arm area to make sure you cover all the lymphatic systems in your armpit and arm area, as this is where many breast cancers develop. Repeat these steps for both breasts. STEP 5 . Lastly, gently squeeze each nipple. You are looking for any discharge or pain. Some women normally have breast tenderness around the time of their period. The best time to check your breasts is about a week after your period ends. It's important you check at the same time every month. Remember you are looking for differences from what is normal to you. The more you get in the habit of checking your breasts the more you know what is 'normal' for you. If you notice any changes, make an appointment to see your doctor immediately. Source: Keep A Breast Foundation . After an ultrasound, mammogram and biopsy, Ms Delaney had to wait three weeks for her results. She said: 'It was surreal. I was celebrating Christmas Day, but I didn't know what the future held for me.' She eventually found out the lumps in both breasts were stage 3 cancer - where the cancer is more developed, there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes and there is a risk it has spread to the surrounding tissues. She was told she would need eight rounds of chemotherapy and a double mastectomy. 'I'd prepared myself for the cancer part, I just couldn't come to terms with the fact I would lose my breasts,' said Ms Delaney. 'Doctors said that even if chemo did destroy the cancerous cells, I'd still need a double mastectomy to be sure I was cancer free. It was devastating.' Ms Delaney cut her hair short in preparation for chemotherapy, but after six sessions she had a reaction. She said: 'I got a tingling feeling in my hands and feet which got worse. At one point I couldn't even do up buttons. 'My doctor decided I should have the mastectomy then complete my course of chemo. During the operation I'd also have a breast reconstruction.' However, prior to surgery, an MRI scan showed that the cancer could be spreading. 'It meant I couldn't have the breast reconstruction until they knew I was cancer-free,' she said. 'It was another blow. 'Afterwards, with my mum by my side, I looked down at my flat chest. 'I don't think it's something I'll ever completely come to terms with but two months on, I did start to feel more comfortable with my body.' While researching breast cancer on the internet Ms Delaney  came across a charity called Hello Beautiful, which uses art to help prevent the disease. Intrigued, she went along to see the charity's art display and ended up meeting the artist. She said: 'The founder Jane Hutchinson was holding an exhibition of her work. 'She makes plaster casts of breast cancer survivors' chests, and then sends them off to be painted vibrant colours. 'I met Jane and she showed me her work. It was so inspiring and powerful. 'Two days later she asked if I would be interested in having a cast made, and I jumped at the chance. 'It's not finished yet but I can't wait to see the final version, which will be displayed in her studio. 'It shows how far I've come, and how important it is to know what's happening with your body.' Ms Delaney, who is hoping to have reconstructive surgery in the future, is now urging women to carry out monthly self-checks, particularly young girls who see breast cancer as an older woman's issue. She's working with Keep A Breast Foundation to spread the message using the hashtag, #CHECKYOURSELFIE. Ms Delaney took her mother Stella, 70, a breast cancer survivor to the initial appointment  for support. Here the pair are pictured on holiday in Italy . Ms Delaney has run a Race for Life to raise money for breast cancer and is working with Keep A Breast Foundation to spread the message about carrying out monthly self-checks . They're encouraging people to download the app Keep A Breast Check Yourself, which helps you master the breast self-exam. Looking back, Ms Delaney said she is grateful her office was so cold, because it led to her being diagnosed with cancer before it was too late. She said: 'If I hadn't hugged myself that day, things could've been very different. 'So now I want to encourage women to do it properly. 'Being cold saved my life. I never thought I'd be thankful for the office air con.'

"Thomas Eric Duncan’s dying wish was to see his son. That desire were the last words spoken by the first Ebola victim to die on American soil. And it was a desperate hope he did not live to fulfill. This tragic revelation has been shared now by Wilshire Baptist Church Senior Pastor George Mason. Mason was speaking at a prayer service on Wednesday evening - planned as a vigil of hope but transformed into one of remembrance by Mr Duncan’s passing at 7.51 this morning. Pastor Mason led prayers for the congregation that included community leaders and a small number of friends and family of Mr Duncan. Scroll down for video . Emotianal tribute: Bishop Nathan Kortu of New Life Fellowship Church in Euless, Texas, preaches to nearly 150 persons in attendance at a service at Wilshire Baptist Church Wednesday dedicated to Thomas Eric Duncan who died  from complications of Ebola . Tragic: Visitors pray during a service for  Duncan, in which speakers revealed the Ebola victim's tragically unfulfilled last wish . Tearful: People hold candles and hold back tears during a  a prayer vigil and memorial at Wilshire Baptist Church for Thomas Eric Duncan after he passed away  from the Ebola . Wanted to see his son: Duncan did two weeks after coming down with symptoms of Ebola and became the face of America's fears the virus could spread Stateside . Louise Troh, 54, the woman who Mr Duncan came to America to marry and the mother of his 19-year-old son, Karsiah, followed the service via a livestream. She remains in quarantine with her 13-year-old son and two nephews followed the service. ‘If you are with us Louise,’ Pastor Mason said simply, ‘We love you and we are praying for you.’ Pastor Mason described Mr Duncan , 42, as a man who had come to this country ‘in hope.’ He said, ‘He had dreams of a life. He had dreams for his son, Eric (Karsiah) ‘The last words that (Thomas) Eric Duncan said were said to a nurse. ‘She asked him what he wanted. He said he wanted to see his son. ‘She asked him where his son was. He said he was in college, where he should be. ‘He was very proud of his son. ‘His son,’ Pastor Mason added, ‘Wanted to see his father too.’ Kasiah Eric Duncan, 19, a student at San Angelo State University, Texas, travelled to Dallas yesterday in hopes of establishing a relationship with the father he last saw when he was just three years old. That was when his mother left Liberia, and Mr Duncan, following a falling out and travelled to America. But Mr Duncan’s condition deteriorated so severely over the weekend that his family could only view him by video link. And even that was so upsetting to them, Karsiah said yesterday, that they could not sleep after seeing him and could not bear to see him again. Ms Troh, who had been in telephone contact with the man who called her ‘the love of his life’ until Friday. But by Saturday, the day he began receiving experimental drug treatment, Mr Duncan was too weak to communicate with her. Earlier today Ms Troh issued a statement in which she told of her ‘sorrow and anger’ at Mr Duncan’s death. Already serious questions are being asked as to the standard of care the dead man received at Texas Presbyterian Hospital. But tonight at the prayer service Pastor Mason sought to place the focus firmly on he said, ‘One man who we did not know a few weeks ago but who has affected our lives forever.’ Over days of intense scrutiny anger has flared over Mr Duncan’s ‘eagerness’ to enter the country. The allegation that he lied on exit documents in Liberia by claiming he had not been exposed to Ebola when he had carried a pregnant woman dying from the virus the day before flying has been much rehearsed. Elegant service: Pastor Mason sought to place the focus firmly on he said, ‘One man who we did not know a few weeks ago but who has affected our lives forever’ Wrenching: The church in which Duncan would have been married later this year instead ‘sang him to heaven’ But tonight Pastor Mason revealed that Mr Duncan’s greatest dream was to rekindle his family in America then return to the country of his birth, to ‘build his country.’ And he said it was his son and Ms Troh who begged Mr Duncan to travel to the States to be with them. He said, ‘Karisah Eric Duncan and his mother called for Eric Duncan to come from Liberia. ‘They wanted to begin a new life together, to rekindle their family. He came in hope.’ Pastor Mason continued, ‘Eric and Louise built a castle of dreams in their hearts together that they never got to live in.’ According to Pastor Mason who is in daily contact with the now grief-stricken woman, Ms Troh told him, ‘Eric wanted to come to this country. He wanted to be a family. He wanted to work hard. ‘He wanted to gain all he could so he could go back to Libera and build his country.’ Mr Troh told Pastor Mason that Mr Duncan was a ‘Christian man’ ‘respectful of his father and mother.’ Her recollection that he ‘knew how to talk to ladies’ provided a brief moment of levity as a ripple of recognition passed through those who were close to him. Pastor Mason clarified, ‘She said he didn’t let anyone use bad language in front of women. ‘He cared for his children and wanted the best for them.’ Describing Ebola as ‘an unwelcome guest in our community,’ Pastor Mason urged the church that has provided spiritual and material support for Ms Troh and the boys who must remain in quarantine until 19 October, ‘to live by faith not fear.’ Pastor Mason said, ‘Every day we make a choice about how we are going ot live.‘Are we going to move away from each other because of fear? Or towards each other because of love?’ Earlier members of the Liberian community – some 10,000 strong – and residents of Vickery Meadows, the area in which the now notorious Ivy Apartment in which Mr Duncan briefly stayed, spoke of the discrimination they had experienced in the wake of this Ebola outbreak. Dallas County Councillor Jennifer Staubach Gates told MailOnline that yesterday morning alone 15 men had come to her telling her that they had been turned away from their jobs. She said, ‘They were told not to come back for 21 days unless they had a note from the health department.’ Tonight Pastor Mason said, ‘Every day we make a choice about how we are going ot live. ‘Are we going to move away from each other because of fear? Or towards each other because of love?’ Ms Troh will not be able to say a final goodbye to Mr Ducan whose funeral will be held before her period of quarantine is over. Earlier Pastor Mason told reporters that his understanding was that the body would have to be cremated. He was unsure as to whether his ashes would be buried or placed in a sealed urn. Associate Pastor Mark Wingfield said that it was likely there would be ‘multiple memorial services,’ for the man who Pastor Mason said, ‘we did not know a few weeks ago (but who) has affected our lives forever.’ Last night the church that he would have been married in later this year instead ‘sang him to heaven.’ ‘We can let him go,’ Pastor Mason said. ‘Without fear even with the loss. ‘Our hearts with hurt and his friends and loved ones will grieve but they know thay can trust him to God.’ ‘We can let him go,’ Pastor Mason said. ‘Without fear even with the loss.‘Our hearts with hurt and his friends and loved ones will grieve but they know thay can trust him to God.’","Pastor George Mason led prayers at Wilshire Baptist in Dallas that included community leaders and a small number of friends and family of Mr Duncan .

"EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker has ridiculed David Cameron’s failures in Brussels – and declared he was ‘not frightened’ of facing him down. The Commission president said he was ‘not the type who trembles in front of prime ministers’ and warned Mr Cameron that he had ‘a problem’ with other EU leaders. Mr Juncker’s remarks come as Mr Cameron battles to reduce the £1.7billion surcharge demanded by the EU to cover years of strong economic growth in the UK while Europe struggled. Jean-Claude Juncker today suggested that David Cameron had an uphill battle to win over the other EU leaders in his battle to cut Britain’s contributions . The Prime Minister was stung last month after the budget demand was leaked during a Brussels summit. Mr Cameron has vowed not to pay ‘anything like’ the £1.7billion being demanded by Brussels by  December 1. He was slapped down by Angela Merkel at the summit two weeks ago when she told him that he had no choice but to pay the bill. Mr Juncker today suggested that the Prime Minister had an uphill battle to win over the other EU leaders in the battle to cut Britain’s contributions. Mr Juncker said: ‘I don't have a problem with David Cameron. He has problem with the other prime ministers.’ To cut Britain’s contributions Mr Cameron will have to convince France and Germany to take a hit on the amount of money they are expecting to get back. The French government is in line for a £788.7million rebate, while Germany stands to receive £614million, following the recalculation of how well each economy in the EU has performed. A meeting of EU finance ministers on Friday is expected to tell George Osborne that he must hand over the full surcharge by next month. Mr Cameron was attacked by Ed Miliband in the Commons today over his handling of the the EU budget negotiations . The chart shows the monstrous bill handed to the UK by the EU in comparison with other member states . In return he is expected to be offered the chance to hand over the extra cash in interest-free instalments. Mr Juncker today warned: “I'm not frightened of any prime ministers. ""I am a not a man who trembles before Prime Ministers or other senior figures. I accept people criticising the Commission, because I myself had many criticisms to make when I wasn't yet Commission president. ""But I do not accept unjustified criticisms, everybody needs to know that. There will no longer be attacks on the Commission without a reaction."" It came after he used his first press conference as Commission president appeared to single out Italian PM Matteo Renzi and Mr Cameron for criticism. He told the European Parliament that he did not like the way that ‘certain prime ministers’ behaved after the demands for additional cash were revealed at last month's European Council summit. Britain's European Commissioner Jonathan Hill held talks with Mr Juncker today . ‘I took notes and when I compared what they had said inside the room with what they said outside, they did not tally up,’ Mr Juncker told the Parliament. Today he told reporters in Brussels: ‘I said yesterday at the Parliament that I am not the leader of a gang of anonymous bureaucrats, I am the leader of 28 political commissioners. ‘We are not bureaucrats, we are not civil servants, we are political people and therefore when anyone tries to take apart the Commission before it has even started its work, I will react. ‘But I have no problem with Mr Renzi, who I appreciate greatly. I don't have a problem with Mr Cameron. Mr Cameron has a problem with the other Prime Ministers.’ Responding to Mr Juncker's comment's, Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: ‘Does the Prime Minister always put the interests of British citizens and British taxpayers first? Of course. He is going to keep doing that. ‘But he works very closely with his EU counterparts.’ Responding to reports that EU officials had suggested the UK could pay its £1.7 billion surcharge in a series of interest-free instalments, Mr Cameron's spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has made the point about the unacceptability of the scale of the bill that was presented.’ Mr Osborne has said he is ‘confident’ of securing a cut after Mr Cameron declared the UK would not pay ‘anything like’ the sum being demanded by the European Commission - which critics claim amounts to a tax on Britain's economic success. The row came as the European Court of Auditors issued another scathing assessment of the handling of the EU £117 billion budget. In a new report, the ECA said that between 3.5 per cent and 5.9 per cent of the EU budget - somewhere between £4 billion and £7 billion - was wrongly spent. It also complained that the entire 2007/13 budget process was ‘too focused on just getting funds spent and needs to place more emphasis on achieving results’ - because of a ‘use it or lose it’ approach.","Jean-Claude Juncker risks controversy by ridiculing UK failures in Brussels .

"The vicious thug appeared to smirk repeatedly as he was sentenced for the cruel act . A boyfriend unable to cope with the breakdown of his relationship hurled his girlfriend's hamster against the wall then stamped it to death before feeding it to his dog. Vicious Ryan O'Brien, 22, killed the helpless pet, called Dave, to get back at Jemma Tracey, 23, after she ended their six-year relationship. Magistrates heard Jemma visited jilted O'Brien's home in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, in July last year to collect her belongings, including her two pet hamsters. Fearing he was facing eviction on top of losing his girlfriend, jobless O'Brien refused to hand the animals over and demanded a £20 ransom for them. But when Jemma refused to pay O'Brien picked up one of the hamsters, called Dave, and warned her she had ‘one more chance'. She again refused to give him the money so O'Brien hurled the pet against the wall of his flat. It crashed off the wall and initially survived the horrific attack until O'Brien, realising the rodent was still alive, crushed the dazed animal under his boot before calling over across his bulldog - to lap up the remains off the floor. Heartless O'Brien reached for the second hamster and threatened to slit its throat before desperate Jemma paid his demand of £5 and fled with her surviving pet. O'Brien was arrested the next day and charged with causing unnecessary suffering to an animal under the 2006 Animal Welfare Act. He attended court flanked by . friends and his new girlfriend, and more than once he appeared to smirk in . the dock. One of his friends was ejected from court for laughing out . loud. But he walked free from court today after magistrates in Stevenage sentenced him to a suspended sentence of six months behind bars after pleading guilty to the act of cruelty dubbed by a magistrate as 'uncontrollable rage'. Mark Jones, prosecuting for the RSPCA, told magistrates the offence was 'premeditated and gratuitous cruelty'. He told Stevenage Magistrates Court told the court that Jemma said she had returned to the property solely to collect her things and that O'Brien flew into a rage because he believed he was about to be evicted. He said: 'Jemma had recently ended the relationship, he could not accept that it was over and he was angry. 'He acknowledged that he had been drinking and she remembers him stumbling around and that his breath smelt of cider. 'He suddenly started screaming at her ""it's all your f****** fault I'm getting kicked out, I hope you die.' Helpless: The hamster was hurled into a wall and then - still alive - was crushed under O'Brien's foot and fed to a dog (file picture) O'Brien walked free from Stevenage Magistrates court today after he was handed a suspended sentence of six months behind bars after pleading guilty . Mr Jones continued: 'He demanded to be paid £20 for the hamsters, threatening to kill them if she didn't pay. 'He picked up Dave and held him in his hand and said ""you've got one more chance"" before throwing the hamster as hard as he could against the wall. 'Miss Tracey said she heard a huge thud and before the hamster fell down behind the sofa. 'He picked it up and said ""oh look, its still alive"" and the dropped it to the floor and stamped on it. ""Miss Tracey says she saw the hamster explode, with it's guts spilling out onto the floor, and he then called over his dog which started to lick up the blood.' Anger: Jemma Tracey said O'Brien was 'laughing and thought it was funny' Mr Jones added: 'As she left O'Brien said to her ""I would have cut the hamster's throat and made you watch me. I hope you and your daughter go in the same coffin.""' The attack took place on 23 July, last year, three months after the Jemma had ended their relationship. O'Brien pleaded guilty on the day that his trial was due to begin at Hertford Magistrates April 3, this year. Jemma Tracey, 23, of Stevenage, said she and the defendant had been in an on-and-off relationship for six years. She ended in March 2011 when she gave birth to her first daughter Honesty, who was not fathered by O'Brien. Speaking after the trial, Jemma said: 'I couldn't stand what he did, I just watched and I couldn't believe it. 'It's disgusting. He was laughing he thought it was funny, he said he wanted to hurt me and that was the best way he could think of. 'I don't believe a word about him being sorry - it's just a game to him.' She added: 'I had had enough of the way he was treating me and I wanted better for my child so I ended it. 'I feel let down that he didn't get jail. He doesn't have any remorse. 'He was laughing when he killed the hamster and he was laughing today in court. 'I'm really angry because he thinks he has got away with it. He has to learn he can't get away with what he has done, you can't do that to an animal. 'His defence says he's sorry but he doesn't act like it and I don't believe him. 'I want people to see what he is really like, he couldn't care less.' Chairman of the bench Malcolm Wulwick condemned O'Brien's 'uncontrollable rage.' He said: 'Mr O'Brien you wilfully killed and mutilated a helpless animal in your uncontrollable rage. 'I sentence you to 24 weeks in prison - this would have been 26 had it not been for your late guilty plea. This sentence will be suspended for two years.' Mr Wulwick also insisted that O'Brien carry out 140 hours of unpaid community service attend an offenders substance abuse programme and pay £375 towards the cost of the case.","Heartless Ryan O'Brien threatened to slit second hamster's throat unless girlfriend gave him £5 .

"A Year 2 boy dubbed 'devil child' and 'son of Satan' has caused a small group of angry parents to demand his removal from a small Catholic primary school . A Year 2 boy dubbed 'devil child' and 'son of Satan' has caused a small group of angry parents to demand his removal from a small Catholic primary school. The  child reportedly 'explodes in rage, damages property and threatens staff', forcing  students to evacuate to another classroom located in the Brisbane primary school,The Sunday Mail reports. The Brisbane Catholic Education office has denied claims made against the boy, insisting the child has never been violent towards staff or students. 'The claims that he has been violent towards students and staff is untrue - he does at time have angry responses', John Phelan, Communication Manager for Brisbane Catholic Education told Daily Mail Australia. 'He is in fact quite popular with other students'. Mr Phelan insists there are only three parents  rallying for removal of the child. He said two of the parents have children in the boy's year. 'We need to be clear that it is three parents in the school who have gone off on this particular crusade,' he said. The Brisbane school have allegedly met with the families involved and have attempted to talk through the issue without removing the Year 2 boy from the Catholic primary school. 'It is upsetting that these three parents believe the only outcome is the removal of the child'. It has been reported that parents have begun to pull  their children out from the Catholic school, in an attempt to avoid further disruption to their education. Mr Phelan admits that a couple of families have left the school but does not know if it is in relation to the young boy's behaviour. 'It is important to note that there is absolutely no disruption within the class'. He said the terms 'devil child' and 'son of Satan' have never been heard by anyone from the school. 'The first time that anyone from the school has head the terminology was when they read it in the paper yesterday - it is completely new and incredibly childish and stupid', Mr Phelan said. Scroll down for video . One parent aware of the boy's rage has opted to take the Catholic approach and has refused to participate in the protest . The young boy has gone through an 'extensive' assessment with a team of psychologists and paediatricians to determine how best to manage his outbursts. 'He does not have any physical or mental impairment – his issue is behavioural. 'We have put in place a strategy which is currently working'. But parents insist  teachers have no control over the 'out of control' child. 'He goes rogue... throws things', one parent said. 'When he was put in the principal's office he put holes in the wall. He's a devil child,' The Sunday Mail reports. Another parent aware of the boy's rage has opted to take the Catholic approach and has refused to participate in the protest. 'He does seem beyond control but this is a Catholic school and we have to support one another', he said. According to Kevin Bates, president of Queensland Teachers' Union, more teachers are now being forced to handle children with behavioural problems. 'The instances of this sort of behaviour coming to bear in a classroom have been on the increase and some principals just expect that teachers will put up with this sort of behaviour and just cope with it', Mr Bates said. Martin King, from Queensland Independent Education Union, told Daily Mail Australia that the principal has a duty of care to ensure the employees are safe in their work environment.

In a statement on The Local website, Wikstrom was quoted as saying: 'We have support for the analysis work we are now carrying out in the area in the form of ships, planes and territorial army personnel. 'The area is heavily trafficked, which is why it's important for us to go public with information about what we're doing.' The Local also quoted a witness to the military operation, Robert Eriksson, who was fishing off the island of Skarpö at around 4pm local time. Ready for action: A soldier mans a machine gun on a Swedish Navy fast-attack craft . 'The coast guard came in over the inlet with an airplane and flew round and round for a long time,' he said, adding that he also spotted a large military craft near the island of Kanholmsfjärden. Neutral Sweden's armed forces have ruled out that it could be some sort of natural phenomenon. The operation was reminiscent of the Cold War, when Sweden's armed forces routinely hunted for Soviet submarines in its waters. Locals using the waters for sailing and fishing reported an increase in military activity on Friday . The underwater activity comes in the wake of last month's aerial interception of Russian planes by UK jets. Royal Air Force jets were deployed from Scotland to intercept Russian military 'Bear' aircraft that were flying too close to the airspace it guards. Aircraft based at RAF Lossiemouth, based in Moray, were sent to identify the aircraft - Tu-95 Russian Bear H bombers - that were spotted in international airspace.

On alert: Fast-attack craft cuts through the water as day breaks in Sweden's Stockholm archipelago . Chief of operations Jonas Wikstrom speaks at a press conference after reports of foreign underwater activity in the Stockholm Archipelago . It was the first time a Quick Reaction Alert had occurred since the base took on the role of defending the UK's Northern airspace. In June two Typhoon jets were scrambled into action to head off four separate groups of Russian aircraft that were flying near the Baltic. The jets were deployed to ensure the Russian planes didn't enter the airspace of Estonia, Lithuania or Latvia. The Ministry of Defence said the aircraft appeared to be carrying out a 'routine training' exercise in international airspace and were later escorted out of the area. That incident followed another where four Typhoons were sent to the Siauliai air base in Lithuania in May to support a Polish-led Nato force which was operating in the region.

"Three decades after it started gaining attention in British curry houses, the great Birmingham Balti has been put forward for official recognition. If the EU grants the dish Protected Food Name status, it would mean anyone in the world cooking the distinctive curry must refer to it as the Birmingham Balti. It would then join French Champagne, Italian Parmesan cheese and British Stilton, which already have the legal protection. The Birmingham Balti has been put forward for EU Protected Food Name status, three years after it started growing in popularity in British curry houses . The Balti was developed by cooks from northern Pakistan when they came to Britain in the 1970s and 1980s. Altering ancestral recipes to incorporate British ingredients and the British palate, they came up with a dish cooked in a steel pan over a high flame. Using meat cooked off the bone, the cooks started using vegetable oil instead of the ghee they had used in Pakistan. They also used dried spices rather than fresh. The EU application, which has been backed by Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss, says that anyone who uses a similar cooking process has to use the official name ‘Birmingham Balti’ - even if it is being cooked in India or Pakistan. Indian TV cook Madhur Jaffrey dismissed baltis as 'a craze' with 'no authentic origin' and predicted 'it will slowly die' in this country . Other British foods to have already achieved the status include the Cornish pasty, Jersey royal potato and Melton Mowbray pork pie. Miss Truss said: ‘Curry is a great part of our food heritage, along with fish and chips and pork pies. ‘Let’s hope the popular Birmingham Balti recipe follows in the footsteps of our other iconic foods like the Cornish pasty and Fenland celery. It would be a wonderful boost for this great city’s world famous Balti Triangle. ‘Legally protecting food names creates new jobs and attracts more tourists to the area. We hope other producers are encouraged to do the same and unlock the full potential that their original recipes can bring.’ Andy Munro, adviser to the Birmingham Balti Restaurant Association said: ‘We look forward to the day when it joins the hallowed ranks of Stilton Cheese and Arbroath Smokies as a protected food.’ Last week, Indian TV cook Madhur Jaffrey dismissed baltis as 'a craze' with 'no authentic origin' and predicted 'it will slowly die' in this country. Jaffrey, who was born in Delhi and became a household name with her BBC cookery shows in the 1980s, said Indian food in Britain was slowly getting better. And the 81-year-old said the Balti, which had 'origins in no place we would want to visit', would slowly die out as people moved on to other Indian dishes. CHEESE .

"Leading scientist: Lord Robert Winston (pictured) demanded answers from the Government about how closely they were monitoring the virus . Leading scientist Lord Robert Winston warned today that the risk of Ebola spreading could dramatically increase if it becomes airborne. At the moment the disease is passed through bodily contact or fluids such as blood and sweat. But in a House of Lords debate, the fertility doctor demanded answers from the Government about how closely they were monitoring the virus. Lord Winston said: ‘We know that viruses mutate, we know that the Ebola virus can mutate. ‘We know perfectly well that it is not airborne at the moment, and we know that the pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract cells are unlikely to harbour the virus. ‘However, can you assure us that people are looking at the risk of mutation of this virus so that we can make certain that its mode of transmission does not change?’ Health minister Earl Howe said there was ‘very close monitoring of the virus and the way it mutates’ and insisted the risk to Britons ‘remains low’. The chief of the UN’s Ebola mission, Anthony Banbury, also warned earlier this month that the virus could become airborne. He said aid workers were racing against time to control the epidemic in case it mutates in a ‘nightmare scenario’. Lord Winston spoke as experts warned the escalating Ebola crisis could see more than 10,000 new cases of the deadly virus in West Africa every week. Test: Passengers being checked at London Heathrow Airport, as enhanced screening for Ebola began today . Checks: Screening for Ebola began after the Health Secretary revealed the virus is expected to reach the UK . The World Health Organisation predicted the spread of the ‘horrible, unforgiving disease’ may accelerate over the next two months. There have been more than 8,900 official cases since the outbreak started in March, killing 4,450 people. But the WHO’s assistant director general, Bruce Aylward, said that by the first week in December, WHO projections suggest there may be between 5,000 and 10,000 new cases a week. Meanwhile screening to counter the threat from Ebola started at Britain's biggest airport today amid doubts over how the checks are being enforced.

"A British neuroscientist who revolutionised our understanding of how the brain works has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine. Professor John O’Keefe, who discovered the brain’s ‘inner GPS system’, has been instrumental in unveiling the way in which Alzheimer’s disease destroys the lives of millions. He has been researching the brain for 50 years and yesterday warned that ageing populations all over the world are creating a health ‘time bomb’. Scroll down for video . British scientist John O'Keefe, from University College London, made the first discovery that contributed towards his prize in 1971 . Thirty-four years later, May Britt and Edvard Moser, of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, discovered another type of nerve cell in the brain - the 'grid cell' But he said experts now know more than ever about how the disease works – and urged scientists to follow his lead in a search for a cure. Professor O’Keefe said yesterday he was ‘still in shock’ at being awarded the prize, adding: ‘It is the highest accolade you can get. It is a terrific sign of the way the world thinks about the works we have been doing and how the world thinks about British neuroscience.’ Who are they? John O'Keefe, 75, an American-British professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London; May-Britt Moser, 51, and Edvard Moser, 52, a married team of neuroscientists at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. For what? For their discoveries of how rats determine where they are and how to move through the world. That lead to a deeper understanding of how the brain, including ours, creates a map of the environment - essentially an inner global positioning system, or GPS. What's the significance? Professor O'Keefe's discoveries had 'a dramatic impact on the study of how the brain creates behavior,' the Nobel committee said. Thirty years later, the Mosers' research in the same field found how activities in so-called grid cells allowed the brain to divide the environment into longitude and latitude, which helps the brain know how far it is from any given starting point. Together the three scientists were cited for having helped bring about a 'paradigm shift in our understanding of how groups of specialized nerve cells work together to execute higher brain functions.' Some say this understanding could eventually revolutionise the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's. Professor O’Keefe, 75, was born in New York but came to University College London as a researcher in 1967. He became a joint US-British citizen after he made the first key discovery in understanding the brain’s navigation system in 1971. He discovered the brain has ‘place cells’ which are specifically for storing memories and together form a kind of map. Some 34 years later Professor O’Keefe and Norwegian couple May-Britt and Edvard Moser made a further breakthrough in finding a cell that generates a co-ordinate system for path-finding. Crucially, the scientists found how Alzheimer’s works at a cellular level by blocking off this ‘internal GPS’ system, which explains why dementia patients often seem disorientated. Professor O’Keefe said the work provided a basis for great strides in Alzheimer’s research. ‘If you do know how the brain works then we have the chance to look at disease,’ he said. ‘We all know there is a time bomb there. I can’t say when we will have a cure, but we now know through our findings how to ask the question of what is going wrong at the earliest stage of Alzheimer’s.’ The Nobel Assembly awarded the £690,000 prize jointly to Professor O’Keefe and the Mosers. It said their findings represent a ‘paradigm shift’ in our knowledge of the brain, adding: ‘It has opened new avenues for understanding other cognitive processes, such as memory, thinking and planning.’ Professor O’Keefe, who was recently presented a separate award by US President Barack Obama, said: ‘I do what I do merrily out of curiosity, because I want to know how the brain works. That will get me up early in the morning and keep me going all day long.’ An excited May-Britt Moser, 51, said: 'This is crazy!' after learning they had won. She said her 52-year-old husband didn't immediately find out about the prize because he was flying Monday morning to the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany, to demonstrate their research. American-born Professor O'Keefe, of University College London,  identified the first component, when he found that a certain type of nerve cell was always activated when a rat was at a certain place in a room . 'This is such a great honor for all of us and all the people who have worked with us and supported us,' she said, adding they had been together for 30 years. 'We are going to continue and hopefully do even more groundbreaking work in the future.' Hege Tunstad, a spokeswoman at the university in Trondheim, said May-Britt Moser was at the university when she found out she had won. 'She needed a minute to cry and speak with her team,' Tunstad said. 'Her husband was on a plane so he doesn't know yet.' The Nobel Assembly said that knowledge about the brain's positioning system may 'help us understand the mechanism underpinning the devastating spatial memory loss', that affects people with Alzheimer's disease. May-Britt Moser is pictured on the phone at a celebration party in the Norwegian University of Science and Technology following the announcement . Edvard Moser didn't immediately find out about the prize because he was flying Monday morning to the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany, to demonstrate their research . The discoveries have also opened new avenues for understanding cognitive functions such as memory, thinking and planning, it said. 'Thanks to our grid and place cells, we don't have to walk around with a map to find our way each time we visit a city because we have that map in our head,' said Juleen Zierath, chair of the medicine prize committee. 'I think, without these cells, we would have a really hard time to survive.' Colleagues and scientists were quick to praise the trio's 'revolutionary' work. Professor John Aggleton, president-elect of the British Neuroscience Association said Professor O'Keefe, who helped found the association, was highly deserving of the accolade. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust added: 'He is a world leader who has inspired a generation of neuroscientists, and whose work as founding director of the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre will further enhance our knowledge of neural circuits and how we behave. 'I know from our many hours of discussions about this hugely exciting project that he is an individual of great humanity, integrity and personal generosity. 'He is also a truly exceptional scientist and it is an honour for me to have worked closely with him over the last year. 'On behalf of myself and the Wellcome Trust I am delighted to offer our very warmest congratulations to John.' The professor, who is married with two sons, is considering putting his half of the prize money towards a scientific trust.","British scientist John O'Keefe and Norwegian couple May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser share the accolade .

"British Ebola victim William Pooley spoke of the pleasure he took in treating patients just days before he contracted the deadly disease. In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Pooley said: 'It's great seeing them walk away after some of them have been in a terrible state. 'Seeing them recover and walk out the door, it's great'.' Dressed in blue medical scrubs, Mr Pooley looked relaxed and happy as he was filmed speaking outside of a treatment centre in Sierra Leone. Scroll down for video . Male . nurse William Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London after . contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone . Dr Oliver Johnson, from London, was already in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, before the Ebola crisis  began. He and his team were working to build and strengthen the health system in the country's capital. Today he described the horror the disease has caused . Earlier today his family thanked doctors fighting to save his life for the 'excellent care' he is being given. In . their first statement since the 29-year-old volunteer nurse arrived . back in the UK for emergency treatment, his family paid tribute to those . who orchestrated his quick return. They said: 'We would like to express our thanks to all involved in bringing our son back to the UK. 'We have been astounded by the speed and way which the various international and UK government agencies have worked together to get Will home. 'He is receiving excellent care at the Royal Free Hospital and we could not ask for him to be in a better place. 'We would like to thank all our family and friends for their best wishes and ask everyone to remember those in other parts of the world suffering with Ebola who do not have access to the same healthcare facilities as Will.' Mr Pooley, who contracted deadly Ebola in . Sierra Leone, is being treated at a specialist isolation ward at the . Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London. Dr Oliver Johnson, who has been treating patients in the county's capital Freetown, said his friend Mr Pooley was an 'extraordinary guy' who knew the risks involved, but was prepared to take them for the sake of the patients and his colleagues. He said: 'He and I spoke about the risk together and I think he absolutely understood that there were risks involved. 'He also knew, though, that he was well trained and there were good precautions in place, so it was a measured risk. 'But where he was in Kenema a number of staff had become sick. 'He was a hugely professional nurse and a hugely dedicated one, so he understood those (risks) but was prepared to take them for the sake of the patients and colleagues he had there.' The High Security Infectious Disease Unit at the Royal Free Hospital, London. This is where any ebola virus victims will end up . Dr Johnson . told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: 'I knew Will before he first came out . to Sierra Leone, we discussed his plans for coming out. 'When the Ebola outbreak really hit, he moved up to Kenema, right to the epicentre of the outbreak to try and help. 'So he and I, my team and him, were in regular contact sharing experiences and when he came to Freetown we would share a beer.' He added: 'Will’s a pretty extraordinary guy. Even for those of us working with Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, he stood out as being particularly brave and really from the beginning he was determined to help in any way he could, not just help patients but I think he had enormous loyalty towards the other staff at Kenema.' Yesterday it emerged that Mr Pooley will be kept behind plastic sheeting for weeks, if not months, to stop the spread of ebola. The 29-year-old nurse was put into an air transit isolator, a clear . plastic sack, to stop the virus escaping into the RAF C-17 transport . plane that flew him home from Freetown. William Pooley told of Sierra Leone’s poverty and his brushes with the country’s political elite shortly before he was struck down by the potentially deadly virus. In a moving email printed in the local village newsletter, he described in vivid detail his first impressions of the west African country which he had travelled to for a six-month volunteering stint at a hospice in the capital Freetown. The nurse, from Eyke, Suffolk, was helping to treat locals suffering from Aids, a disease which, according to the UN, 57,000 people live with and remains a lasting legacy of the country’s decade-long bloody civil war. A group of volunteers wear special uniforms to bury ebola victims in Kptema graveyard in Kenema, Sierra Leone . At one village meeting Mr Pooley was confronted with armed guards, singled out by dancing 'devils' because of his white skin and sampled the hospitality of the well-heeled locals made rich from the country’s controversial diamond mining industry. In an email printed in Inside Eyke, he said: 'After pushing through a crowd outside the house we were ushered inside by police with AK47s. 'The host, rich and influential thanks to diamonds, had his house boys serve us cans of ice-cold, European lager. 'The deputy leader of the APC (All People’s Congress) was there, apparently the second most powerful politician in the country.' He told how he was treated to a show from the 'devils' - locals in an assortment of costumes, their faces painted or covered with wooden masks. He said: 'The devils danced wildly to drums and gourd shakers and drew quite a crowd....As the only white face in the crowd, the devils singled me out for harassment. 'In order to escape from under their hay and frock skirts I had to give them small change. It was all in good humour.” But it was not all colourful entertainment and Mr Pooley also revealed the poverty and poor sanitation which blight so many lives there. He said: 'The houses are all mud-sand and palm thatch, the water is from one communal well and, of course, there is no electricity.' The account was printed by his mother Jackie Pooley, who said her son had been touched by the tales of 'horror' of those caught up in the country’s civil war, which ended in 2002. In a testament to her son’s dedication, she wrote: 'Above all, though, he finds the people there friendly, funny and hospitable, and is settling into his work, which is to provide home-based palliative care, generally for cancer and Aids sufferers, a facility which would be absent were it not for the hospice.' On board was a team of British specialists who conducted a full clinical examination before confirming he was safe to fly. Foreign . Secretary Philip Hammond gave the final approval for the repatriation . before the transporter took off at 1.50pm UK time. Ebola is an extremely . infectious virus, spreading from person to person as a result of direct . contact with skin or bodily fluids such as blood or sweat. The plastic sheeting that will shroud Mr . Pooley's body for weeks will protect health workers and other patients . from catching the disease. Throughout the flight the doctors were covered in head-to-toe protective suits – the same uniform will be worn by everyone Mr Pooley sees over the coming weeks. On landing at RAF Northolt last night the volunteer nurse – still inside his plastic bubble – was loaded into an ambulance and driven to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London. There, he was admitted through a specially-assigned hospital entrance, before being taken to the hospital's high-level isolation unit – the only ward in the UK equipped to cope with ebola. He will occupy a £25,000 bed that will be burned after he leaves the hospital. The bed will sit inside an isolation tent. Only seven doctors and a handful of nurses will be allowed to enter the room. Mr Pooley's treatment will focus on replacing the fluid he loses through internal bleeding. Police escorting British ebola patient William Pooley to the Royal Free Hospital in north London . An intravenous drip will pump saline solution into his body to try to stop his organs failing. The doctors will also treat the bleeding from his nose, eyes and ears. If they cannot get hold of the experimental ebola drug ZMapp, the doctors will simply try to manage the disease until Mr Pooley's immune system is strong enough to fight it off. A filtration system will suck the air away, removing all contaminated vapour before it is pumped out of the building. The air will also be kept under negative pressure to stop any escaping from the tent. Human waste will be collected in a secure container similar to a pressure cooker before it is decontaminated and disposed of. Stephen Mepham, one of the senior doctors at the unit, said earlier this month: 'The reason behind the unit is to protect healthcare workers from highly contagious infections such as ebola. 'Everything is contained within the tent under negative pressure so the air is constantly added and removed. 'Outside the tent, the air flows through a series of filters and is deposited outside the hospital.'","William Pooley was interviewed just days before he contracted the disease .

"Pilots have been asked not to fly over Edinburgh zoo to avoid disturbing pregnant panda Tian Tian. The Civil Aviation Authority published a notice asking pilots not to fly in the area, after the zoo requested a reduction in noise during the breeding season. Zookeepers asked for the measure to be taken after Tian Tian - whose name means ‘Sweetie’ - was artificially inseminated earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Zoo keepers in Edinburgh believe Tian Tain the panda is pregnant and should give birth at the end of August . The panda was artificially inseminated in April and now there is an anxious wait to see if there is a cub . To give Tian Tian her best chance, pilots have been asked to avoid the airspace around Edinburgh Zoo . After months of careful monitoring, they announced last week that the giant panda is pregnant and may give birth by the end of August. If the pregnancy is successful the panda cub will be the first ever to be born in Britain, a huge success for conservationists and a coup for Scotland in the run-up to the independence vote in September. Public interest in the panda and her mate Yang Guang is very high, undimmed by two previous unsuccessful breeding attempts. The pair, who are on loan to Edinburgh Zoo from China, failed to mate in 2012 and Tian Tian had a failed pregnancy last year. This time, aided by modern artificial insemination techniques, scientists hope they could finally see a panda cub - or even twins or triplets - born in Britain. If the pregnancy is successful it could mean a £50million boost to the Scottish economy, studies suggest. Pilots approaching Edinburgh Airport have been asked to avoid a one mile radius of the local zoo . Edinburgh Airport, pictured is approximately four miles west of Edinburgh Zoo where Tian Tian is kept . A Notice To Airmen, or NoTam, was published by the Civil Aviation Authority asking pilots not to fly in the area if possible to reduce noise from low-flying planes and helicopters. NoTams are usually issued to alert aircraft pilots to potential hazards along a flight route such as cranes, closed runways or large public events. The notice covering Edinburgh Zoo was issued in July to protect all its animals, notably its breeding penguin population. But the likely pregnancy of Tian Tian was also a factor, the zoo said. It comes during the Edinburgh Festival and Military Tattoo, which sees increased air traffic over the city, including RAF displays. A spokesman for the zoo told The Herald newspaper: ‘Edinburgh Zoo has a NoTam in place over its airspace to prevent disturbance to all animals in the collection, yet it is mainly asked in consideration of the breeding penguin colony. ‘It is particularly relevant at this time of year due to the regular increased activity of low-flying aircraft and hovering helicopters which occur as a result of the festival. ‘We have been in contact with the Military Tattoo and the RAF for several years now and they have both always been very supportive and considerate of our requests.’ The giant panda was artificially inseminated on April 13 and experts at the zoo monitored Tian Tian closely in the following months. Last week it was revealed that the latest scientific data suggests she is pregnant. Zookeepers have said things are progressing as expected and they are ‘keeping their fingers crossed’ for the arrival of a cub at the end of this month. Tian Tian’s hormone and protein levels are being checked regularly but it will not be known for certain if she is pregnant until she gives birth. A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said: ‘Following a request from Edinburgh Zoo through the air traffic control unit at Edinburgh Airport, we issued a NoTam on July 11 requesting pilots to not fly within a one-mile radius of the zoo or below 1,900 feet above sea level. ‘The NoTam was advisory so if necessary, pilots could still fly through this area providing they complied with the rules of the air. ‘The NoTam expired on July 31 and there are no plans to issue any similar advice to pilots operating in the area.’","Tian Tian the panda was artificially inseminated  in April in Edinburgh Zoo .

"Rotherham council staff seized and destroyed damning evidence of a hidden child sex abuse scandal, reports claim. The alleged cover-up has been reported just days after it emerged the abuse of 1,400 girls went uninvestigated for 16 years. Officials are said to have ordered a raid on the town's young people's service centre and seized nothing but the details of victims, offenders, and grooming cases that would have contributed to a landmark report in 2000, The Times reported. Scroll down for video . Cover-up? Council officials are said to have seized details that would have exposed the abuses in 2000 . The Home Office report on the South Yorkshire town has yet to be published. The allegations will pile pressure on officials including embattled children’s services chief Joyce Thacker, who was still refusing to resign last night despite mounting evidence of her extraordinary complacency during a period of horrific and widespread child abuse. Just five months ago she insisted that ‘a sense of proportionality’ was needed about the problem. Even after several critical reports into the council’s failure to deal with child abuse, Mrs Thacker told the Rotherham Safeguarding Children Board that she did not want it to focus entirely on child abuse. Minutes of a meeting in March this year show she ‘reiterated’ that the council, social services and police ‘need to retain a sense of proportionality with regard to child sexual exploitation’. Mrs Thacker, who earns £115,000 a year, said the issue made up just ‘2.3 per cent of safeguarding work in Rotherham’, adding: ‘Although it is a very important issue, child neglect is a much more significant problem in the borough.’ Professor Alexis Jay’s report said: ‘This is not an appropriate message for senior managers to give.’ Defiant response: Joyce Thacker told a meeting that agencies need to 'retain a sense of proportionality' with regards to the widespread sex abuse scandal in Rotherham that spanned 16 years . But in a defiant statement last night, Mrs Thacker said the report found the council made ‘clear and significant improvements’ under her leadership. She said: ‘Like most people, I feel appalled at the horrific experiences which many of our young people went through, and I add my sincere apologies to those who were let down by our services... It lays bare what went wrong, and there are simply no excuses. ‘These are very difficult times and we need all of the experience and ability we can bring to bear. ‘The best way I can exercise my responsibility is to drive forward the report’s recommendations, and make sure young people in Rotherham are even safer.’ Mrs Thacker’s predecessor, Sonia Sharp, yesterday admitted most senior staff would have known of the scale of the abuse. Dr Sharp, who now works in Australia, said she was briefed when she joined the authority in 2005. She said: ‘We knew there were many children in the community at risk and feared that this was the tip of an iceberg.’ She admitted the predominant view had been that abuse victims were ‘promiscuous teenagers in consensual relationships’. The Home Affairs Select Committee has criticised Mrs Thacker for viewing prosecution of rapists as a ‘secondary’ priority – which it found was partly to blame for an abysmal lack of convictions. Martin Kimber, chief executive of Rotherham Council, last night refused to sack Mrs Thacker. He said: ‘Alexis Jay has made it very clear to me in her report that Joyce Thacker is part of the solution in achieving better services.’","Council officials 'ordered raid on youth service ahead of 2000 report'

"To live in Australia is to experience the devastating fury of bushfires, meaning nearly every single Australian is affected by the firefighters who fight to keep us safe. An SBS documentary airing this week gives a glimpse into the incredible life of a firefighter - including heart pumping Go-Pro footage from the helmet of a Rural Fire Service volunteer, running through smoke with flames licking at his heels. Australia has the largest firefighting force in the world with a volunteer army of over 200,000 - double that of the military. More than a million Australians have built homes in fire zone areas. 2013 was the hottest year on record and on the verge of another sweltering summer, firefighters will be on call to save not only Australian homes, but also our lives. Astonishingly the men and women that put their lives on the line for our are largely unpaid volunteers. Scroll down for video . Australia has the largest firefighting force in the world with a volunteer army of over 200,000 to fight fires and save lives . 2013 was the hottest year on record and on the verge of another sweltering Summer, firefighters are preparing to battle the flames . Images from shocking Go-Pro footage, strapped to the helmet of a firefighter battling an extreme blaze in rural NSW . ‘Many people still believe firefighters get paid. They don’t realise that they do it for free,’ Ben Shepherd, a volunteer firefighter of more than 20 years. ‘There is such a huge mix of people that volunteer with the fire service. The value of the volunteers cannot be measured.' ‘We’re very fortunate to the time and effort given by thousands of volunteers. Their time would be worth billions of dollars if they were to be paid.’ In the footage, the firefighter is forced to seek refuge in the firetruck, when the flames encroach upon him . Many people are unaware that most firefighters are unpaid and are also 'lawyers, butchers, doctors, chefs – even the Prime Minister is a volunteer with the rural service' People are unaware that underneath the fireman’s suit, there very well could be another uniform from the volunteer’s day job. ‘Sometimes it’s a surprise for people to find out that the firefighter may well be a lawyer, butcher, doctor, chef – even our Prime Minister is a volunteer with the rural service.’ NSW Rural Fire Service Inspector Ben Shepherd was a volunteer for 20 years before he joined the service in a paid media role. ‘I have been very lucky to turn a hobby in a career. I absolutely love working here. You’re working with people that want to work here so much that they come for free.’ Mr Shepherd says that after every major fire, they are inundated by people wanting to volunteer, which makes it such an enjoyable place to work . Mr Shepherd says that after every major fire, they are inundated by people throwing their hands up to volunteer, which illustrates the spirit of the service. When fires ripped through Mr Shepherd’s neighbourhood in 1994, he felt the pull to join the rural fire service. ‘I had family that were members are after that event, they told me to come and check it out,’ said Mr Shepherd. ‘I’ve never looked back.’ Since he joined, Mr Shepherd has been involved fighting fires all around New South Wales, working with various brigades. The Rural Fire Service is able to assist a staggering 95 per cent of the vast state. The Rural Fire Service is able to assist a staggering 95 per cent of the vast state with brigades set up right throughout Australia . Australians may also be unaware that the title ‘firefighters’ is deceiving – there is much more to the job description. ‘It’s an absolutely amazing service. It’s not just bush fires, there are also house fires, motor vehicle access after car accidents, helping in search and rescues… Ways to help the community.’ Mr Shepherd is passionate about fighting fires, but admits there are moments of fear when facing a raging, unpredictable wall of fire. ‘There are definitely times when there’s the possibility the fire will do damage and the potential of being injured or killed. As well as fighting house and bushfires, firefighters offer assistance during car accidents, search and rescues and other situations where the community need aid . ‘In the Christmas fires of 2001 and 2002 there were times standing in the backyard of a property in a valley with a fast-moving fire moving towards you. ‘That was confronting, there’s adrenaline involved in that.’ In the heat of the moment, the RFS training and years of experience kick in – as does the instinctual ‘survival mode’. ‘In those incidents, your mind quickly clicks back to the training and past experiences fighting fires. You also have your team members around you. ‘But when the fire is crowning towards you with huge amounts of heat, you are thinking “Am I in a safe spot? Can I get out of it?”’ Men and women of all ages are involved with the fire service, and all are welcome. Any possible time they have to volunteer is appreciated . There is a great sense of community within the Rural Fire Service, with many volunteers making steadfast friends for life . ‘You need to ensure that your life comes first and that you know when to step back.’ The challenge is that nature is completely unpredictable and despite years of experience, a firefighter must always be on alert. ‘When you’re relaxed, a fire will catch you out,’ said Mr Shepherd. ‘Every fire is different. There are always complex issues around them, like the vegetation or their location which changes how the fire behaves.’ ‘They all react in their own unique way. You are always learning.’ Working as a firefighter isn’t just a physical job. One of the most important parts of the role is being a pillar of strength to people affected by the devastation of a bushfire or another tragedy. ‘We can be a comforter to someone going through the worst day of their life. An eery scene from the Go-Pro footage, where the house is barely recognisable through the smoke and ash of the approaching blaze . ‘We help how we can – if it’s holding a drip during a car accident when someone is trapped inside their vehicle or giving someone advice about how to deal with incoming fire,’ said Mr Shepherd. While these tasks may seem daunting, Mr Shepherd says it is enormously gratifying. ‘Everyone gets a sense of reward through things. There are times when I have stopped and thought to myself, “you know, I really love this.”” Surprisingly, there are also a large number of animals who benefit from the RFS. Firefighters saving cats from trees is certainly not a myth – it is a very regular occurrence. 'The most unusual job was saving a horse stuck in a pool. 'We had to calm down a horse while it was standing in a backyard pool, it was definitely the most unusual call I've had!' There are many jobs available for volunteers in the RFS, with jobs that are just as important behind the scenes including administration and administration, training and courses such as First Aid .

"John Simpson, pictured, wrote about the unnamed paedophile in his autobiography, claiming he abused children in the BBC toilets . Another BBC radio celebrity whose career spanned half a century is alleged to have molested young boys he invited into his studio at Broadcasting House. It is claimed the abuse was hushed up by corporation bosses, who wrote to the parents of any boys who complained advising them not to take the allegations further. The name of the man, who was a children’s radio star, is already circulating on Twitter and other sites. It has been passed to police examining the torrent of allegations against the late Jimmy Savile. The man’s alleged sex crimes were first raised in a book written by respected BBC World Affairs Editor John Simpson, 68, more than ten years ago. He said he was told of them when compiling the man’s obituary shortly after his death in 1967. Simpson claimed he was told to keep them secret by his immediate boss. Yesterday the Sun newspaper ran a report on the affair, giving the man the same pseudonym – ‘Uncle Dick’ – that Simpson had used in his book. But last night thousands could see his name on Twitter, after numerous users posted it having followed the obvious clues given by Simpson to identify him. The man’s daughters and grandchildren said yesterday that the claims were ‘complete rubbish’, apparently made on scant secondhand evidence. None of the relatives had heard anything about the allegations until contacted by the Daily Mail yesterday, even though they were first published in 1999. Scroll down for video . It is the second BBC child abuser to have been revealed in less than a month after Jimmy Savile, pictured, was alleged to have abused children over six decades . They were contained in Simpson’s . autobiography, Strange Places, Questionable People. In it, the . journalist wrote of his early years at the BBC, and of ‘Uncle Dick’s’ death in 1967. He had worked at the corporation since the 1920s. Simpson said he was asked to write the radio star’s obituary, and as research rang a woman he named as ‘Auntie Gladys’. This woman reportedly described ‘Uncle Dick’ as ‘an evil old b******’ and added: ‘I hope he died in agony.’ Simpson wrote in his autobiography: . ‘Week after week, children from all over the country would win . competitions to visit the BBC and meet Uncle Dick. He would welcome . them, show them around, give them lunch, then take them to the gents and . interfere with them. ‘If parents complained, the Director . General’s office would write saying the nation wouldn’t understand such . an accusation against a much-loved figure.’ A TV director reported Savile to BBC bosses decades ago - when he caught the star having sex with a 15 or 16-year-old girl in his dressing room . Simpson went on to say that he told his editor of these allegations – but was hectored into writing a report praising him. According to his account, his boss . called him a ‘stupid, unthinking, ignorant, destructive young idiot’, . before going on to dictate: ‘Auntie Gladys told the BBC tonight that she . was deeply saddened by Uncle Dick’s death. He had a wonderful way with . children.’ Simpson said the editor then told him: ‘That’s how you do an obit.’ Simpson was yesterday abroad and not responding to messages. Last night one of the man’s . daughters, who is 76 and lives near London, told the Daily Mail: ‘I’m . absolutely astounded by these claims. My father did nothing but good. He . was disabled and did a lot for charity. He was a patron of one charity . alongside the Queen Mother. ‘And he was a very busy man who did not have the opportunity to invite children to the BBC or to do these things. ‘As far as I understand John Simpson . was on BBC television, not radio, so never met my father – and this is . all hearsay. John Simpson should be for the high jump. How dare he say . something like this. ‘And what a terribly hurtful thing for this “Auntie Gladys” to say, “I hope he died in agony”.’ ‘Uncle Dick’s’ other daughter, an . 80-year-old living in Sussex, similarly denied there could be any truth . to the claims. Her daughter, a 51-year-old lawyer, added: ‘Obviously we . totally refute these allegations. ‘Nothing like this has ever been . raised in the entire lifetime of my mother or her sister.

"Timothy Jarvis, 18, was just days into starting a maths degree at the University of Essex when the tragic accident occurred . A mother condemned the ‘dangerous culture’ of freshers’ week binge-drinking yesterday after her student son died in a drunken fall. Timothy Jarvis, 18, was in the first week of his maths degree when he downed an entire bottle of rum in 15 minutes for a bet. The former grammar school boy then suffered fatal head injuries after tumbling down a flight of stairs at his university’s hall of residence. Despite being taken to hospital, it was 90 minutes before he was assessed by a doctor and he died the next day. His grieving mother Marina, 54, said: ‘I don’t see the point of freshers’ week at all and I think it should be banned. ‘They think they are adults, but they are not – they have left the nest but they are still children. ‘They are there to study, not drink, and this tradition of cheap drinks and getting drunk is a very dangerous culture. ‘Suddenly this antisocial binge-drinking is only acceptable because it’s happening at university where the young intelligentsia are. ‘It is truly tragic what happened to our son, but this could happen to all parents with children at university.’ Mr Jarvis, from Orpington, Kent, won a place at Essex University last year after achieving four good A levels at St Olave’s Grammar School. His inquest heard the popular musician had made a bet with friends on his corridor that he could drink a bottle of rum in half an hour. Fellow student Dimitris Vachaviolos, 19, said: ‘Tim was drinking a bottle of rum and my friend had a stopwatch going. It was just a game. ‘He had a bet that he could drink a bottle of rum in 30 minutes. He did it. He drunk it in 15 minutes, actually.’ Mr Vachaviolos said he helped Mr Jarvis downstairs and out of the hall of residence, where he was sick, before he tried to help him up to bed. ‘As we tried to get him into bed he turned and started chasing me and a couple of girls,’ he said. ‘Again, it was just a game, there was nothing malicious about it. ‘My room was at the end of the corridor, with a stairwell next to it. 'I closed my door and expected him to follow me in, but he didn’t come to my door, he went straight into the stairwell. ‘I heard what I can only describe as a tumble or fall.’ He found Mr Jarvis unconscious at the bottom of the stairs with a large swelling near his eye. When paramedics arrived and found Mr Jarvis unconscious, they made a ‘red alert’ call to Colchester Hospital to warn them to expect a serious case. But when they arrived at 12.35am, . there was no trauma team to meet them, Mr Jarvis was left on a trolley . in a corridor and was not assessed by a doctor for nearly 90 minutes. NHS guidelines say every patient should be examined by a nurse within 15 . minutes and by a doctor within an hour. Eventually at 2am, a junior doctor noticed the teenager was ‘very unwell’. CT scans revealed severe bleeding on . the brain and he was transferred to the neurosurgery department at . Queen’s Hospital, Romford, where he underwent emergency surgery at 5am. He died the next day. Death: University of Essex halls of residence in Colchester. The former grammar school boy suffered . massive head injuries after drunkenly stumbling down a flight of stairs . following a night of heavy drinking . Although Walthamstow coroner, Chinyere Inyama, recorded a verdict of accidental death, he was highly critical of the hospital. ‘A public authority needs to have systems in place to prevent such a death, any death,’ he said. ‘The word tragedy is used a lot but I can’t think of a more appropriate word in this case – it was a true tragedy.’ Verdict: accidental death.","Timothy Jarvis, 18, was just days into starting a maths degree at the University of Essex .

"Two British women endured a terrifying four hours trapped under a tourist boat after it capsized in shark-infested waters near Cape Town. Lynette Hartman, 55, and Bronwyn Armstrong were stuck under one of the two hulls and survived by breathing pockets of air. Fellow tourist Peter Hyett, 64, Vale of Glamorgan, south Wales, died after the charter boat, which was carrying 40 people on a seal-spotting trip, overturned just after at 2pm on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Rescue effort: A police diver brings one of the women to safety after swimming her out of the upturned hull of the Miroshga and is handed to sea rescue volunteers . Rescued: Bronwyn Armstrong was stuck under one of the two hulls and survived by breathing pockets of air . The two British women were found clinging . on beneath the boat by divers looking for bodies and rescuers communicated by tapping on the hull. With the sea temperature at less than . 10C (50F), they would have been unlikely to survive for much longer than an . hour if they had been in open water. Police divers gave them breathing equipment and emergency scuba training before persuading them to remove their life jackets so they could swim down and clear of the 36ft hull. Craig Lambinon, of the National Sea and Rescue Institute, said most of the passengers were rescued by nearby charter boats. Grief: Sharleen Malan cries after the body of her partner John Roberts, a crew member of a capsized boat, was recovered. They were to be married next week . Inconsolable: Family members of John Roberts cry as his body is recovered from the water . But he said the two women ‘had . somehow become trapped when the boat flipped and had found an air pocket . which they were using to breathe’, Mr Lambinon said. ‘They were freezing cold as they were wearing just their life jackets and normal clothes. ‘The teams found them but they were . very scared and it took a long time to coax them to take off their life . jackets and swim out. ‘The women had to be coached in the water in using the breathing equipment and were eventually freed at around 5.50pm. ‘It was obviously a terrifying ordeal for them, but they should now start to recover.’ Both women were treated for . hypothermia and Miss Hartmann suffered damage to her eyes from diesel in . the water getting behind her contact lenses. Probe: It is unclear what caused the Miroshga to capsize. South African police have begun an investigation . Survivors — treated in Cape Town . hospitals for hypothermia and shock — said the motorboat lost power and . took on water before being swept on to rocks. Mr Hyett was taken to shore, where he was pronounced dead. The dead Briton's wife and daughter Suzanne, 63, and her daughter Helen, 37, from Bournemouth, survived the . accident and were treated in hospital. Last night after identifying the body Mrs Hyett  said: 'At the moment things are a bit raw. It’s been such a shock.' City of Cape Town emergency services . spokesman Wilfred Solomons-Johannes said the two women were ‘totally . devastated – we are offering them all the care and help we can’. Dignity: Rescue personnel hold a sheet to shield a body being carried away after the boat accident . The family had been due to return to the UK yesterday after a two-week holiday in South Africa . The coast around Cape Town is also . known for a large population of great white sharks. A second man, South African tour guide John Roberts, also died in the water. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We . can confirm the death of a British national in this incident. Several . British nationals were also hospitalised following the incident, most of . whom have now been released.’ Alive: Rescuers help survivors after the accident, which took place off in the seaside town of Hout Bay . The motorised boat, called the . Miroshga, capsized three miles out to sea as it carried tourists from . the fishing port of Hout Bay to Duiker Island, known for its large seal . colony. The South African Maritime Safety Authority has launched an investigation into the accident. Passenger Emma Tengskog, a Swedish tourist, said: ‘I was up on the roof. Suddenly I saw a lot of water inside the boat. ‘We drifted to the rocks, then there were a lot of waves coming. One big wave hit the boat and it flipped over.’ Exhaustion: A National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) crewman reacts after recovering survivors and bodies from the accident . Fisherman Alfonso Wichman, whose boat . was the first at the scene, said: ‘The first thing we saw was the boat . capsized and an empty life raft, and then dozens of people thrashing in . the waves. ‘It looked like a nightmare. We were especially concerned about the children and elderly.’ The website of tour operator Southern . Ambition Marine Safaris says safety on the Miroshga, which runs regular . whale, dolphin and seal-watching trips, ‘is of paramount importance’. The Hyetts, who had both been married previously, had been on holiday with Mrs Hyett’s daughter Helen since October 1. A family friend said last night: ‘This . is such a shock. They were so happy and enjoying life together. Sue had . beaten breast cancer just a few years ago and they were making the most . of his retirement and the time they had together. Sombre: Rescue personnel carry a body to shore. Scores more were injured in the wreck . Survivor: Rescue volunteers haul a passenger out of the water.

"A Newcastle photographer has created the world's first printer which produces self-destructing documents, just like those seen in Mission: Impossible. Similar in size to a regular printer but much more complex, the device coats paper in particular substances that begin to ignite when combined. This gives the reader just 60 seconds to read the paper document before it bursts into flames. Scroll down for videos . A printer that creates self-destructing paper (shown) has been unveiled. The device was created by Newcastle photographer Diego Pisanty. It is part of a project called 'This Tape Will Self Destruct'. Its name is in homage to the 1966 spy series Mission Impossible, which also spawned several movies . Diego Pisanty, 27, spent a year building the printer. The complex machine coats one part of the paper with a light dusting of potassium salts while layering another section with glycerol gel. Once the print is finished, a mechanism in the printer presses the two sections together, sparking a chemical reaction which destroys the document in a Mission: Impossible-style blaze after a delay of around a minute. Mr Pisanty titled his quirky homebrew project This Tape Will Self Destruct in homage to the 1966 spy series. Earlier this month Tokyo-based electronics company Epson  unveiled two new printers that have refillable tanks rather than ink cartridges. In place of costly cartridges they both have an ink reservoir. This can print 4,000 pages in black or 6,500 in colour on one fill. When depleted it costs £8 to refill the printers with Epson's own ink. Two printers are on sale now, the L355 at £249.99 ($400) and the L555 at £329.99 ($530). Both come with wireless connectivity so users can print from their smartphones. Mr Pisanty said: 'It's a pretty slow reaction so it gives you about a minute to read the document. It will then start to smoke and eventually go up in flames.' The printer cost more than £4,000 ($6,440) to build. Mr Pisanty used a laser cutter to fashion many of the machine's individual components. Mr Pisanty said: 'It took a very long time to build. I had no social life for the best part of a year.' Despite the machine's potential for making sure sensitive documents do not fall into the wrong hands, Mr Pisanty is pessimistic about its chances of adoption among the security services. He said: 'I don't think the security agencies will be using this technology any time soon. 'They're more interested in encryption for digital files. 'There isn't much need for the destruction of hard-copy documents any more.' The £4,000 printer coats paper in potassium salts and glycerol gel. When combined they start to ignite in 60 seconds. This gives the reader just a minute before the paper catches fire. Mr Pisanty got the idea from the NSA and Wikileaks scandals. But he says it might not have much use in the digital age . 'What was happening in the news really reminded me of 1960s spy novels,' said Mr Pisanty. 'It was this blurring of fiction and reality that made me want to take something from a spy thriller and make a real, functioning object.' Pictured is a scene from the 1996 movie Mission: Impossible starring Tom Cruise . Mr Pisanty became fascinated with replicating the iconic TV gadget after reading several articles on the NSA and Wikileaks scandals. Mr Pisanty said: 'I had read an article on how the Russians had gone back to using typewriters to avoid the leaking of digital files. 'What was happening in the news really reminded me of 1960s spy novels. 'It was this blurring of fiction and reality that made me want to take something from a spy thriller and make a real, functioning object.' In September 2014 Mr Pisanty, who was born in Mexico, debuted the machine in Mexico's San Pedro Museum in Puebla. While on display guests could print out combustible documents that were stored on an internal, encrypted, SD card within the printer. Video footage and burnt images from This Tape Will Self Destruct will stay on display at the San Pedro Museum until February 2015. The machine itself was put into storage having been deemed a major fire hazard if operated without supervision.","A printer that creates self-destructing paper has been unveiled .

'Stop flights into the U.S. from West Africa immediately! #EBOLA' Trump wasn't flattered by Dockett's promotion of his views. Instead, Trump tweeted an article chronicling the plagiarism and followed it with the phrase 'I was playgiarised' -- yes, that is how he spelled the word. However, Trump wasn't too upset, in his next tweet, just two minutes later, Trump tweeted the article again, but this time he included the statement 'I will not sue Darnell.'

Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton faced a furious backlash last night as he was crowned BBC Sports Personality of the year, beating Rory McIlroy (right) and Jo Pavey (left) Furious twitter users took the site to vent their fury that someone who ‘doesn’t even have TV license’ should win such a prestigious BBC award. Chris Hall wrote: ‘The real travesty is that kids inspired by Lewis Hamilton will never get chances he did thanks to tax-dodgers like him.’ Another critic, John Torrie, added: ‘#SportsPersonality An oxymoron perpetuated by the choice of Lewis Hamilton. Proud to be born British but doesn’t want to live here among us.’ Within minutes of receiving the award amid a standing ovation from guests at the event in Glasgow, the racing driver was being attacked on social media for his status as a tax exile . During his speech, Hamilton said his family were his inspiration and paused to hug his younger brother Nicholas (right) before collecting his trophy . Javier Mejia wrote: ‘Right in saying Lewis Hamilton is a UK tax exile? Given personality award by the BBC, funded by everybody’s license fee.’ Another twitter user @nick_moore added: ‘He pays no tax, has zero personality and doesn’t even have a tv licence. How does that work? @LewisHamilton #SportsPersonality #GetInspired’ But despite the controversy, with 209,920 public votes, Hamilton’s victory over second place McIlroy was decisive. The golfer, who was the favourite of many to win the award, trailed behind with 123,745 votes while long distance runner Jo Pavey came third with 99,913 votes. Earlier in the evening, Hamilton, 29, was joined on the red carpet not by his glamorous singer girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger but by his pet bulldog Roscoe much to the amusement of fans .

Earlier in the evening, Hamilton, 29, was joined on the red carpet not by his glamorous singer girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger but by his pet bulldog Roscoe much to the amusement of fans. Speaking during the ceremony, Hamilton said his family were his inspiration and paused to hug his younger brother Nicholas before collecting his trophy. He said: ‘I’m so proud and honoured to be among such great sporting talent. I want to say a huge thank you to all the people who called in, I really wasn’t expecting it. The BBC was left red-faced when, several minutes before the official result was announced an error on its website claimed golfer Rory McIlroy was the winner. An update to the site at 10.21 under the headline ‘McIlroy wins Sports Personality award’ said: ‘Golfer Rory McIlroy wins 2014 BBC Sports Personality of the Year.’ It was hastily removed to be replaced with the real winner Lewis Hamilton several minutes later. ‘I could not have done this without my amazing team, my family, my dad who once had four jobs to help me, my brother. ‘I’ve been incredibly inspired by them. I never thought in a million years I’d be surrounded by such people. ‘Thank you to all the fans. I always say we win and lose together because I feel your love. I feel so proud to carry the Union flag and hope I will continue to make you proud.’ Hamilton won his second Formula 1 world title last month after edging an often controversial battle with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg when he clinched the crown with victory at Abu Dhabi. He moved to the exclusive tax haven state of Monaco in 2012 after several years living in Switzerland. The other contenders for last night’s award were Real Madrid footballer Gareth Bale, dressage rider Charlotte Dujardin, boxer Carl Froch, skiier Kelly Gallagher and her guide Charlotte Evans, swimmer Adam Peaty, gymnast Max Whitlock and skeleton racer Lizzy Yarnold.

"Nikki Westgarth, pictured with her son Jake Grimes, died from flu four days after giving birth to her second child Eva Rose . A 21-year-old mother-of-two died of flu four days after her baby daughter was delivered via emergency C-section. Nikki Westgarth never got to meet  Eva Rose Westgarth-Burrell, who was born on February 4. Lying in a critical condition in hospital, doctors made the decision to deliver her unborn child via C-section. But four days later Miss Westgarth lost her life to the common illness. Her mother Kim Hannant is now bringing up Eva and her older brother Jake Grimes, four. The 57-year-old is now calling for all women in at-risk groups to ensure they have a yearly flu jab - an injection that could have saved her daughter. It was shortly after Christmas last year that Miss Westgarth began to feel tired and run down. But Mrs Hannant said the family just attributed it to her being pregnant. 'Then just after New Year, the whole family came down with the flu,' she said. 'I have asthma and I've had my jab for the last 10 years, so didn't suffer as much as everybody else. 'Nikki lived next door to us, and she came in and complained that she felt like she was dying. 'I thought she was joking, but she was so concerned that she went to hospital, but wasn't admitted. 'The next day she was still very concerned so went to hospital, who admitted her to maternity. 'Once the family were given the all clear from flu, we were able to visit her. She was in good spirits, but said she was in a bit of pain. However whilst I was there, she said she'd started to cough up blood. 'After helping her out of bed to go to the toilet I went to help one of the nurses with some paperwork, and when I came back I couldn't find Nikki. The 21-year-old's mother Kim Hannant, pictured with Eva Rose and Jake, is today urging all pregnant women to ensure they have the seasonal flu jab, which is available free of charge to all expectant mothers, as well as others in at risk groups including anyone over the age of 65 and people with existing health problems . The flu jab is available every year on the NHS to protect adults and some children, at risk. Flu can be an unpleasant illness. But for those who are otherwise healthy, it usually clears up on its own within a week. However, for some people the illness can be much more severe, even life-threatening. Those at risk include: . Anyone in a risk group is likely to develop serious complications, such as pneumonia. The flu vaccine is given free of charge to: . The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November. For those not deemed at risk, it is possible to pay to have a flu jab. Boots Pharmacies are offering the vaccination in store. Deepa Songara, Boots flu pharmacist said: 'We spend less time outside and much longer closer together at home or in indoor places. 'This 'togetherness' makes it easier to pass germs from one person to another so it is important to think ahead and try to protect yourself before the cold and flu season really kicks in. 'Busy communal places are ideal breeding environments for winter bugs and simple things like washing your hands or using alcohol based hand gel can help keep you well.' 'I went to the bathroom and found her slumped behind the door. The nurses worked quickly to get her back on to the bed and monitored her very closely.' Miss Westgarth, of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, came round but her condition took a turn for the worse. She was treated in critical care at Darlington Memorial Hospital for two weeks. Mrs Hannant said: 'She was very agitated and kept saying to me ""please mam, don't let me die"". 'She was sitting up and talking and about four in the morning they said I would be fine to go home and get some sleep. 'But very quickly after arriving home I got a call that I needed to go back to the hospital as Nikki had taken a turn for the worse and was in critical care. The doctor told us that the baby was fine, but at this stage we were more concerned about Nikki.' As her condition deteriorated doctors arranged to have her transferred to a hospital in Leicester to give birth to Eva Rose with specialist support. It was while she was in critical care that Miss Westgarth turned 21. Her mother said: 'She briefly came round from life-support and was given a Caesarean section to deliver Eva Rose as she was suffering pre-eclampsia. 'She never got to see Eva Rose before she died. 'Four days later, whilst I was away from the hospital resting, I was called back. When I got there, the nurses told me that Nikki's heart had stopped, we'd lost our little girl.' Her relatives are now backing this year's national NHS campaign urging people, including pregnant women, to make sure they have a flu vaccination. Mrs Hannant added: 'If it saves even one person, and saves one family from going through what we went through then her death wasn't for nothing.'","Nikki Westgarth died four days after giving birth to baby Eva Rose .

"Lin Chen pictured enjoying a cigarette as he walked the streets of London this week . His was supposed to be the case that showed Britain would no longer let criminals use the Human Rights Act to dodge deportation. But this violent Chinese burglar has still not been told to leave the country – despite judges saying he should be booted out last Monday. The Daily Mail found Lin Chen – released from jail half-way through a five-year sentence for tying up and threatening to kill two women – enjoying a cigarette as he walked the streets of London. He said he had no idea he was set to be deported under a tough new regime, despite attending two appointments with immigration officials since last Monday’s judgment. When told of the latest ruling, Chen said he had no plans to leave the new three-bedroom semi in North London he shares with his Chinese wife and their son, six, and daughter, three. He is now seeking legal aid for a six-figure fight to stay put – even though his father-in-law had the cash to settle a £200,000 debt while he was in jail. The greying Chen – who claims to be 28 – was amazed to be told he faces deportation. ‘Every Wednesday I have to report to the big immigration centre [in Croydon, south London],’ he said. ‘They didn’t tell me anything about me being deported last week, or this week. ‘My lawyer told me it would cost £100,000 to appeal to the European courts. I’m going to try to get legal aid. I’ve got no money now.’ Asked why he could not take his wife and children to China as judges suggested, Chen said: ‘My children are British citizens. In China, I didn’t have a house or anything, and everything has changed since I was there. What job could I do there? ‘Here, I can work in a kitchen, be a driver ... anything is easy because I’ve lived here for a long time.’ Chen was not keen to dwell on the two counts of robbery he pleaded guilty to in 2010. He entered the home of two sleeping women in the middle of the night, tied them up and terrorised them into telling him their PINs – but after one victim escaped her restraints and called the police, officers caught Chen hiding in the toilet. Claiming he made ‘about £200’ in the robbery, Chen said: ‘I don’t understand the law here. I do something wrong – I’m guilty, I go to jail. ‘I owed somebody money, and they said they wanted to kill me, so I made a mistake. They [his victims] left the door open, that’s how I got in. But I’ve done my sentence. Since then I’ve done nothing wrong.’ Originally from the bustling province of Fujian on the south-eastern coast of China, Chen came to England in 2002 when he claimed to be 16 – but social services decided he was at least two years older. Denied asylum in August of that year, he stayed on illegally. His wife, who came to Britain as an accountancy student in 2001, had their son in 2007, and Chen was duly granted ‘indefinite leave to remain’. It was Home Secretary Theresa May who said when Chen was jailed in 2010 that he would have to be deported upon release. Yet when that time came – just halfway through his sentence – Chen battled to stay, invoking the Human Rights Act’s ‘right to a family life’. A first hearing by immigration judges ruled in his favour – but two years later, the Court of Appeal said he should be kicked out after the Home Secretary changed the law to force judges to only consider the right to a family life in ‘exceptional cases’. Home Secretary Theresa May changed the law to force judges to only consider the 'right to a family life' deportation clause in exceptional circumstances . Following a law change, the Court of Appeal (pictured) said Chen should be kicked out of the country . Mrs May said last week: ‘I welcome this judgment, which sends out a clear message to foreign nationals who break the law that they face deportation and can no longer exploit the system to stay in the UK.’ Her new laws have slashed the number of grounds on which foreign criminals can challenge rulings from 17 to four, as well as banning them from continually bringing up ‘new evidence’ to keep their cases dragging on. A Home Office spokesman said last night that Chen was free on immigration bail pending any appeal he may make against deportation. A government source added: ‘Lin Chen is not on a fast plane to China because he’s still got several appeal routes – and it’s difficult to say how long he’s got to try them.’ The National Audit Office warned last week that each foreign criminal costs the taxpayer an average of £70,000 a year, adding up to a total bill of about £1billion a year.","Lin Chen photographed still wandering the streets of London this week .

"A mother told the High Court yesterday that ‘miracles do happen’ as she pleaded for the life of her critically ill baby son. The boy, who was left severely brain damaged after a traumatic premature birth by Caesarean section, has spent his short life on a ventilator in an intensive care unit. The NHS Trust in the case is carrying out what the health service calls a ‘serious untoward incident’ investigation after accepting that something had ‘gone wrong’. A mother told the High Court yesterday that ‘miracles do happen’ as she pleaded for the life of her critically ill baby son, who was left severely brain damaged after a traumatic premature birth (file picture) Now doctors at the hospital involved say there is nothing more they can do for the child and it is in his best interests to have his life-support machines switched off – against the wishes of his parents who believe he can recover. Today, a High Court judge will rule on the case of the one-year-old boy who cannot be named or otherwise identified for legal reasons. But in an impassioned appeal to the Family Division of the High Court yesterday, the child’s mother, who cannot be named, said she refused to believe the NHS or the courts should have the right to end her baby’s life. ‘At the end of the day he is still alive,’ she said. ‘The ventilator is helping and supporting that life. ‘Where there is life I don’t think you should get the right to determine whether that should be taken away. We believe that [he] does respond to us … We don’t feel that the Trust has the right to end his life because he has got brain damage.’ She added that she felt her son might one day recover to the point where he could experience ‘pleasures of life’, adding: ‘He is still alive. Miracles do happen.’ The boy’s father, also unnamed, told the court his son could sense the environment around him and added that no one should be allowed to ‘take the privilege of life from him’. In words that echoed those of the parents of five-year-old cancer victim Ashya King, whose family fled the UK after disagreements with the NHS over his treatment, the baby’s father said they had been made to feel ‘our child is not our child any more’ by doctors who gave ‘no consideration’ to their feelings. He said: ‘Even though [my son] is going through all these problems, he still knows … what is going on … He knows, he acknowledges certain things that are going around him. As parents, we want him to be alive. That is our desire. We want him to be comfortable. ‘I spend a lot of time with him, talking to him. I know when he is listening … We know he is reacting to certain things. He still has life.’ The case echoes that of five-year-old cancer victim Ashya King, whose family fled the UK after disagreements with the NHS over his treatment . He said he believed as time went on his son would ‘develop much better’, adding: ‘We have told these doctors several times of the improvements that he is making and they have always refused to listen to what we have to say … We have been told that this child is not even our child any more. I just cannot believe they can come out with some of these things.’ Ms Justice Alison Russell will today decide whether the child should have ‘life-sustaining care’ withdrawn. Claire Watson, representing the unnamed NHS trust, told the court yesterday that the boy was born prematurely by emergency Caesarean section in ‘poor condition’ and had suffered ‘profound irreversible brain damage’. But she admitted that there had been problems with the care the child received and told the judge: ‘The trust have endeavoured to be entirely transparent about what has gone wrong.’ Miss Watson added that the baby cannot breathe without a ventilator and that since his birth his condition had not improved despite ‘ongoing intensive care’. She said that as a result specialists recommended that removing his life-support was in the boy’s best interests.

"Anti-fascist activists clashed on the streets of Calais yesterday with protesters angry at the town’s swelling migrant population. Young men and women, many wearing black face masks and carrying large wooden sticks, congregated outside the town hall to confront right-wing demonstrators. It is the latest outburst in the escalating tensions among migrants and local communities which have reached breaking point in the last week. Scroll down for video . Left-wing youths in black face masks and carrying long wooden sticks stormed a town hall protest by right-wing demonstrators as tensions in the French town rise . The right-wing group Sauvons Calais – meaning ‘Save Calais’ – were protesting against the growing number of people, mostly from the Horn of Africa, Sudan and Afghanistan, who have set up camp as they try to enter the UK. Around 300 riot police were called in to try to maintain peace as the protesters found themselves under attack from left-wing supporters of the foreigners. Last night police struggled to set up barricades to keep the two groups separate as violence and vandalism raged on the streets. The unrest follows the revelation yesterday that the UK government has offered to send 9ft-high steel fences to the town to improve security. The 12 miles of fencing was used at the Nato summit in Wales last week, and the Home Office says it is much stronger than the barriers currently in place at the French port. Around 250 people attended yesterday’s anti-immigration rally, including skinheads with white power flags. One wore a T-shirt saying ‘Charlemagne 1944’, in reference to a Second World War Nazi division made up entirely of French volunteers. Around ten demonstrators also appeared to make ‘Heil Hitler’ salutes during the stand-off with their left-wing opponents – although organisers claimed they were just being used to mock the ‘left-wing fascists’. Kevin Reche, a former member of the French National Front said that the ‘Left-wing scum’ were trying to prevent them ‘speaking up for the people of Calais.’ Earlier this week migrants, most of whom have travelled to France from the Horn of Africa, Sudan and Afghanistan, attempted to storm a ferry bound for Britain . He added: ‘There are all kinds of people demonstrating for a safe Calais – from the far right, to those without any political views. We are all calling for justice.’ Sauvons Calais is demanding that the migrants be expelled from the Calais area, and that anyone sheltering or feeding them is arrested. Amid the anger more moderate Calais residents spoke of their alarm at the effect the volume of migrants has had on the town. Noelle Richard, 46, was at the rally with her school-age daughter. Thousands of migrants have set up camp in the French town in the hope of entering the UK . She said: ‘We just want a better future for own children. Having lots of young men sleeping rough in the town makes for a very unpleasant atmosphere.’ There have already been attacks on squatters in Calais and some temporary camps have been illegally burned down. Fears are growing for what might happen if demonstrators are able to get too near the desperate migrants. On Friday some 200 migrants marched through the streets chanting ‘UK, UK, we want to go to the UK’, and ‘We demand our human rights’. Last Wednesday scores of them attempted to storm a ferry bound for the UK, and Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart has threatened to close the docks. Mrs Bouchart said she wanted ‘far more help from the British government’ to deal with people attempting to cross the Channel illegally. But former Home Secretary Michael Howard, now Lord Howard, rebuffed this call saying France needed to ‘get its act together’ to deal with the growing crisis by itself. According to the Calais prefecture, 7,414 undocumented migrants were arrested in Calais in the first six months of this year, compared with the 3,129 detained in the same period of 2013. Many arrive in the town with the sole intention of sneaking onto trucks or ferries bound for Britain because they see it as a promised land with generous benefits for refugees. The situation has led to a nightly game of cat-and-mouse with police as migrants attempt to break into lorries. Some 400 would-be stowaways were caught by French police last weekend alone. However those caught are then released, leaving them free to try again.","Youths carrying large wooden sticks congregated outside town hall .

"James and Hoa Titcombe launched a campaign after their son Joshua died at Furness General Hospital . Investigators probing failings at a scandal-hit hospital are looking into the deaths of more than 50 mothers and babies. An inquiry into the NHS trust running Furness General Hospital in Cumbria was first ordered last year by ministers following fears over the deaths of at least eight mothers and babies. But having reviewed more than 200 deaths between 2004 and 2013, some 50 cases have now been identified for a more detailed investigation before a full report is released before the end of the year. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt ordered the inquiry in September last year following a campaign by James Titcombe, whose baby son Joshua died at Furness General in 2008 following an infection. Mr Titcombe, a former nuclear engineer who now works as a national safety adviser for the Care Quality Commission (CQC), told the Nursing Times: ‘It is really worrying that there are about 50 cases where they have sufficient concerns to examine cases further. ‘I am pleased with the way the inquiry is operating. They are interviewing the right people and it seems to be a very thorough process with no stone left unturned.’ The inquiry was also set up to address concerns that health regulators at the CQC covered up their failure to act on concerns about maternity care at the University Hospitals of Morecombe Bay Foundation Trust. Each case involves the deaths of mothers in or after labour, still births or the deaths of newborns which are now being examined. The inquiry is due to resume interviews next week following a break during the summer. It is being led by Dr Bill Kirkup, a former deputy chief medical officer, part of the Hillsborough and Savile inquiries. He has asked former health secretaries to give evidence, having already heard from Sir David Nicholson, a former chief executive of the NHS and Cynthia Bower, a former chief executive of the CQC. The inquiry is holding its hearings in private but is due to publish its findings in November. Morecombe Bay Trust is already facing at least 30 negligence claims brought by bereaved parents and family members claiming sub-standard care. Baby Joshua died at Furness General Hospital in 2008 following an infection. After his death his parents called for an investigation, prompting Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to order an inquiry in September last year . An internal review by the trust uncovered concerns about the maternity unit in March 2010. It highlighted poor training of midwives, and a 'dysfunctional' relationship between staff. However, CQC inspectors failed to read the report and later that year visited the hospital, ruling it was 'safe'. In October 2011 leaked figures revealed the trust had the highest mortality rate in the UK, with 600 'excess deaths' in the previous four years. Three grieving families contacted the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman in 2011 fearing that more lives would be lost unless the hospital was investigated. The deaths of Nittaya Hendrickson, 35, her son Chester, Alex Brady and Joshua Titcombe all occurred within three months at the hospital. In December the ombudsman Dame Julie Mellor published her findings which concluded there was a series of major failings by midwives may have contributed to the deaths. In the case of baby Joshua Titcombe, who died in November 2008 when he was nine days old, the report highlighted he would have had a 90 per cent chance of survival had he been given antibiotics. In October 2011, leaked figures revealed Morecambe Bay Trust, which operates the Furness General Hospital, pictured, had the highest mortality rate in the UK, with 600 'excess deaths' in the previous four years . Midwives assumed his temperature was low because the room was cold - when he was actually suffering a serious chest infection. He was left in the hands of a junior maternity assistant whose other tasks included serving up patients’ food. The report also found that Nittaya Hendrickson and baby Chester died in July 2008 after midwives failed to carry out crucial checks despite knowing the birth would be high risk. Mrs Hendrickson was diabetic and midwives should have checked the baby’s heart every five minutes but they didn’t even do this every 15 minutes as would happen in a normal labour. And it found that Alex Brady was stillborn in September 2008 after midwives failed to intervene quickly when his mother got into difficulties and did not monitor the baby’s heart. One, referred only as ‘midwife C’, was involved in another baby’s death in 2004 in which she was found to have again failed to checked the heart rate.","More than 50 deaths of mothers and babies at Furness General Hospital are under investigation, it has emerged .

"The first victim of the Rotherham paedophiles to waive her anonymity last night called for South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright to quit. Sarah Wilson, who fell prey to Asian attackers aged 11, said: ‘You have to hold me back from unleashing my years of torment on him. ‘He was supposed to protect me – instead he let me and thousands of girls and their families down. ‘He needs to face the music and be held accountable. The way he’s trying to cling on to his job is a joke.’ Sarah Wilson was just one of 1,400 children to fall prey to gangs of Asian abusers. Stock image used . In an earlier family tragedy, Miss Wilson’s younger sister, Laura, died in the UK’s first white honour killing carried out by an Asian boyfriend. She was 17 when she was stabbed and dumped in a canal by Ashtiaq Ashgar. He murdered her after she told his family about their relationship. Their mother now looks after Laura’s daughter, four, fathered by another Asian man. Miss Wilson said: ‘It’s time the people who failed me and my murdered sister are rolled out into the public to face their shameful behaviour. No one listened to us for years and now they’ve been found out they think it’s as easy as just resigning and apologising. Nothing can repair the damage their lack of care has caused.’ Miss Wilson told The Sun newspaper she had been abused by dozens of men during a five-year period when she was in and out of care. The predators plied her with alcohol and cannabis and forced her to perform sexual favours in return. Police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright's resignation has been called for in the wake of the damning report . Having now turned her life around, and eight weeks pregnant with her first child, she said she was speaking out to persuade other victims to come forward. She said she was 11 when she was first targeted, when three men aged around 20 befriended her outside the primary school gates. Then, one day still wearing her school uniform, she was forced to perform a sex act on a 20-year-old. She added: ‘These men were manipulating me and the authorities should have known that. I was young and bullied but they made me feel part of something. ‘Men right up to their 40s said they were my friends, bought me into their circle and plied me with drink and cannabis. But then they demanded I repay them. ‘They’d take me in their cars to parks, houses, anywhere they wanted and demand I perform sex acts on them or sex. I didn’t know what to do. I felt scared. ‘People forced themselves on me. I spent many hours speaking to authorities who all knew what was going on. But for five years I was allowed to be targeted by vile creatures.’ She said she was taken in by social services half a dozen times and even had an assigned social worker who was ‘very much aware of what was happening’. Another woman who was abused as a teenager told last night how social workers allowed her to have daily contact with a man ten years older than her who was suspected of grooming dozens of young girls for sex. Katie – not her real name – was one of 54 girls abused by the man she saw as her boyfriend, as well as his friends. She says that despite knowing he had served two stints in jail for violent crime and was part of a circle of men under investigation for sexual exploitation, social workers allowed her to leave her foster home at night to meet him. Now 29, she is one of 15 girls bringing a civil case against the council and police. She said ‘people at the top’ had covered up what happened to her and the others. Katie added: ‘They’re trained to recognise it and they were adults. They’ve got to be stupid not to recognise signs of abuse.’ Children in Rotherham (pictured) were threatened with fire and told not to speak out, the report revealed .","Victim waives right to anonymity and calls for crime commissioner to quit .

"It is a national institution that has seen some big changes over the last few years. In a bid to keep up with the changing times the Girl Guide movement have introduced ‘body confidence training’, scrapped the reference to God in their promise, and perhaps most controversially hired a former abortion rights campaigner as their chief executive. Now, for only the eighth time in their hundred year history the Girl Guide uniform is also getting a major revamp. Scroll down for video . Bright idea: Two Guides show off their new blue tops - teamed with jeans . Stylish: The two-tone zip-up polo shirts that can be worn with leggings, shorts or turquoise patterned skirt . Fashion forward: Designers who spoke with Guides were told they wanted to preserve their own style, and not look too boyish . Out are the woggles, neck scarves and navy skirts of years gone by, replaced with two-tone zip-up polo shirts that can be worn with leggings, shorts or turquoise patterned skirt. It is the first time the Girl Guide uniform has been updated in fourteen years and to give the range a youthful touch the organisation brought in a team of five female designers from Arts University Bournemouth. Fashion students Kate Facer, Jessica Gray, Megan Wright, Hattie Lines and Georgia Lightwood spent a year speaking to groups of current Guides aged 10-14 about what they wanted to wear. The conclusion was a focus on comfort and flexibility but also to preserve their own style and not look ‘too boyish.’ Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret during their time as Guides in 1943. The uniform they wore had not changed much since the 1920s . They way they were: Guides looking smart in the 1970s . It’s been almost fifteen years since the decision was taken to allow girl guides to wear jeans – so long as they were blue- as part of their uniform and this latest remodel sees a further move towards a much more casual style. Girls now have a choice of long and short-sleeved tops to wear with trousers, leggings, skirts, jeans and shorts as well as a uniform dress and skirt. The utilitarian designs come in sky blue with bright red cuffs and sleeves and girls can choose how to mix and match their uniform - a far cry from the strict uniform standards of previous generations. From today the polo shirt, £12.50, and hoodie, £20, will be available for the first time with the rest of the range due to be released in October. Chief Guide, Gill Slocombe said: ‘We’re exceptionally proud of the young women who have taken such care over this project. We are thrilled with the designs - they’re fresh, young and versatile.’ Revamp: A major change came in 1990 when Jeff Banks launched the first attempt at modernising the uniform including for the first time polo shirts, sweatshirts, jogging bottoms and t-shirts . Changing tastes: In 1998 this more casual approach was confirmed with the introduction of blue jeans and again in 2000 when fashion designer Ally Capellino added a rugby shirt and body-warmer to the range . The Girl Guides were founded in 1910 as the answer for girls to the rapidly-growing Boy Scout movement. Girls were keen to join on the activities already enjoyed by their brothers but Scouts founder Robert Baden-Powel disapproved of mixing the sexes so his sister Agnes helped set up a girl’s equivalent called the Guides. At the start of the movement uniforms were mostly homemade and often brown like the uniforms of the Scouts’ but varied hugely depending on what was available - many were in fact uniforms outgrown by the early Guide’s brothers which they customised to fit them. By the 1920s a uniform of navy dresses or a navy blouse and skirt had emerged, worn with a scarf folded into a tie and broad-brimmed hat had emerged and these began to be embellished with badges. Over the next few decades the uniform remained largely unchanged although skirts shortened to knee length and the navy was replaced with a brighter blue. The next major change came in 1990 when Jeff Banks launched the first attempt at modernising the uniform including for the first time polo shirts, sweatshirts, jogging bottoms and t-shirts. In 1998 this more casual approach was confirmed with the introduction of blue jeans and again in 2000 when fashion designer Ally Capellino added a rugby shirt and body-warmer to the range.","Woggles and neck scarves make way for zip-up polo shirts .

"New rail minister: Claire Perry invoked fury when she said commuters enjoy ‘fair fares for comfortable commuting’ on the same day they were warned of ticket price increases . Commuters reacted with fury yesterday after the new rail minister declared that they enjoy ‘fair fares for comfortable commuting’ – on the same day they were warned of another inflation-busting rise in ticket prices. Claire Perry, facing accusations of shocking complacency, also insisted that high prices could be avoided by simply booking ahead. Yesterday it was revealed that next year’s increase is likely to be 3.5 per cent and some prices could rise by as much as 5.5 per cent. Fares have already increased by nearly 25 per cent since David Cameron came to power in May 2010. But Miss Perry said: ‘What we have got to do is to make sure rail passengers – who could be forgiven for saying: “What on earth am I getting for these rises that I’ve seen over the last decade?” – start to realise they are paying fair fares for comfortable commuting.’ If Miss Perry – who regularly uses a car to get into work – takes the train from her constituency of Devizes, Wiltshire, she is able to claim back the cost of a standard class ticket from her nearest station of Pewsey into London. Her comments were met with scorn by commuters yesterday. Phil Guichard, 47, a marketing director, said: ‘I would like to see the minister on the 07.45 to Paddington. ‘It’s not comfortable at all. At peak times I’m lucky to get a seat.’ Julie Ward, 47, a nurse from near Maidenhead, said her experience was ‘horrendous’, but still costs £240 a month. She said: ‘I find it unbelievable that they can charge so much and give such awful service. ‘I’ve actually thought about videoing it and sending it to the minister so she can see what it’s really like. I don’t think she’d call it comfortable then.’ Another commuter, Iain Irvine, 51, said the transport minister needed ‘a reality check’ if she thought the railways offered good value for money. The company secretary, who gets a 5am train to keep down the £400 a month cost of his commute from Bristol to Paddington, said: ‘The only reason I use the trains is because I have no choice. If they want us to pay more they need to improve the services. Commuters wait to squeeze on to the next train to Victoria Station at Clapham Junction, south London . Rail fares will soar by up to 5.5% in January - and by an average of 3.5% - following this morning's announcement that RPI inflation was 2.5% in July . ‘It’s just not good enough. If the minister thinks they represent value for money she needs a bit of a reality check.’ The annual increase in train fares is linked to July’s inflation figure, published yesterday by the Office for National Statistics, plus one percentage point. With the retail prices index at 2.5 per cent last month, this means rail fares will typically rise by 3.5 per cent in January 2015, although some increases could be even bigger. The Chancellor George Osborne could soften the blow, and he is likely to face growing pressure in the coming months to allow an increase of RPI but no more. But in a BBC interview yesterday, Miss Perry dismissed claims that train fares are cripplingly expensive. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said rail prices would rise by 24 per cent by 2018 . When asked whether it was fair that a London to Manchester ticket can cost £160, she said this was ‘only if you don’t book in advance’. In fact, the popular Trainline website yesterday showed a day return ticket before 9am to Manchester Piccadilly costs £164 to travel today. If booked a fortnight in advance, it is only £23 cheaper to travel at the same times. Questioned on Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday, she insisted: ‘People don’t just rock up to the station, like probably you and I do, and pay the maximum amount.’ The proposed increases are particularly painful because workers have faced six years of pay freezes, minimal rises or even cuts in wages. For example, the cost of a season ticket to London for commuters from Brighton is expected to jump by around £150 a year to around £4,455, according to the Campaign for Better Transport. This is the pressure group’s estimate of what the cost will be – although the rail operating companies have not yet published next year’s fares. Martin Abrams of the Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘If your ticket price is rising four times faster than your salary, or you’re a part-time worker with no choice but to pay for a full-time fare, or you’re stuck with creaking 30-year old diesel trains, or even if you’d just like a seat in return for your £5,000 season ticket, then your fare will seem anything but fair and comfortable.’ Mary Creagh, Labour’s transport spokesman, said: ‘This is shocking complacency from yet another out-of-touch Tory. Many passengers facing inflation-busting fare rises don’t even get a seat on their train to work, let alone “comfortable commuting”. ‘When you go through that every single day, the experience is not a good one.’ Last night, the Department for Transport said no decision has been taken about fare rises for 2015, but a spokesman added that the department was ‘looking closely at the cost of travel as part of our ongoing commitment to help hard-working people’.","Train tickets will go up by up to 5.5% in January it was revealed today .

"He is well known for his holiday fashion faux pas. And as his latest family photographs show, David Cameron has once again managed to put his foot in it. Posing in a battered pair of open-toed leather sandals, the Prime Minister showed that when it comes to dressing, there are some things he has yet to learn from his time in office. Scroll down for video . David and Samantha enjoy a coffee at the Surfside Cafe in Polzeath, Cornwall, today on the family's fifteenth holiday since moving into Downing Street in 2010 . Mr . Cameron, who was ‘chillaxing’ in Cornwall on his third holiday this . year, was again shown up by his wife Samantha, who looked stylish and . relaxed in skinny-fit jeans and flip flops. It not the first time that he has fallen foul of the footwear fashion police. During a . similar photo call in Lanzarote earlier this year he was mocked for . sticking to the same clunky loafers he had been spotted in on previous . holidays.

This is despite the ample practice Mr Cameron has managed to squeeze in during his time in office – a total of 15 breaks. The PM showed off a pair of brown sandals, which make a change from his usual choice of block work shoes with jeans . Over the . years, his fashion faux pas have ranged from wearing his smart black . work shoes sockless in the Mediterranean heat to donning grubby running . trainers and white socks for a walk around a Spanish town. In his first . year in power, and the year his fourth child Florence was born, Mr . Cameron managed only one trip to Cornwall. But he . made up for it the following year with no fewer than five holidays as he . took his family to Malaga, Cornwall, Ibiza and celebrated Mrs Cameron’s . 40th birthday in Granada before spending a fortnight in a luxury . 300-year-old villa in the Tuscan countryside.

"Santosh Benjamin-Muthiah died in a house fire sparked by a model of fridge that had a long history of safety problems ignored by the manufacturer, an inquest heard today . A father died saving his children from a blaze caused by a fridge-freezer that the manufacturer knew was a potential fire risk, an inquest heard yesterday. Santosh Benjamin-Muthiah, 36, passed his baby daughter to a neighbour but was overcome as smoke filled the family home. His wife Jennifer Benjamin, a paediatrician who was on maternity leave, was left in a coma for two weeks but survived along with their three-year-old daughter, who had been pushed out of a window on to a flat roof by her father. Mrs Benjamin told the inquest that there had been a problem with the Beko fridge-freezer icing up days earlier but she had not had time to call the manufacturer. If Beko had sent her a recall notice about the model – linked to several house fires over the previous seven years – the tragedy would not have happened, she said. Investigators found the fridge’s manual open at the page containing contact numbers. They discovered that the fire in November 2010 was caused by a fault with the defrost timer mechanism. Beko, one of Europe’s largest white goods brands, had been aware of a problem with components as far back as 2003 but failed to rectify it, North London Coroner’s Court heard. In 2007 independent testing firm Intertek recommended a product recall but its conclusions were rejected by Beko. Intertek later amended its rating of the dangers from ‘serious’ to ‘moderate’ meaning no recall was required. London Fire Brigade had written to Beko following a number of fires on similar fridges, but the Turkish firm recalled the model only after Mr Muthiah’s death. The Microsoft software engineer was pulled unconscious from the blaze at his home in Wealdstone, North West London but died eight days later. In a statement read to the inquest, his wife said: ‘Since Santosh’s death I am aware that Beko issued a voluntary recall of the relevant fridge-freezer models.‘Had I received notice of this recall I am adamant that I would have acted immediately and contacted the manufacturer.’ Barnet Coroner's Court heard that the fire was caused by a faulty Beko fridge freezer, which the company knew had defects . Dr Benjamin said that the fridge-freezer ‘had been playing up a bit’, adding: ‘I did not think it was anything serious. ‘I . had got the appliance manual out ready to call up to ask about it but . did not get round to it because I was... busy with my new baby. ‘As food was not spoiling I did not think [it] an urgent issue.’ Clayton . Witter, Beko’s managing director between 2002 and 2010, confirmed that . despite receiving some 15 reports of fires caused by appliances between . 2003 and 2006, the firm did not feel the fault was serious enough to . warrant a recall. He told the coroner that Beko did not believe lives were at risk but admitted ‘that may have been the wrong view in hindsight’. He . said: ‘I had no particular concern around the fires reported to us at . that time. Some were component faults where there had been smoke or the . smell of smoke, but nothing so dramatic.’ Last night Beko issued a . statement saying none of its current range of appliances is affected by . the issues surrounding this case. The firm urged anyone with a . pre-2007 model to check its website http://refsafety.beko.co.uk to see . if their product is affected. The inquest continues.

"A man was seriously ill in hospital last night after he was bitten by an adder. The 44-year-old was flown to hospital by air ambulance after being struck three times by the snake in Dalby Forest. The victim, who has not been named, was treated at the scene by paramedics. Scroll down for video . A man is seriously ill after being bitten by an adder, file picture, at an adventure park in North Yorkshire . Alan Eves, of the Forestry Commission, said Dalby Forest has a ‘thriving population’ of the snakes. Although . an adder’s venom poses little danger to healthy adults, the bites can . be extremely painful and require urgent  medical attention. The last person to die from an adder bite in Britain is believed to have been a five-year-old child in Scotland in 1975. In the wild, their venom immobilises small prey such as lizards, amphibians, nestlings and small mammals. Adders strike and then leave the venom to take effect, before returning to devour their prey. Last month, an 11-year-old boy was bitten by a poisonous snake as he went to retrieve his football from a bramble bush. Carl Jefferies was playing near his home outside Bolton, in Lancashire, when he lost the ball on a grassy area. As he went to retrieve it, an adder sank its fangs into his left leg. He was treated successfully in hospital. The man was bitten near the Go-Ape outdoor adventure site, pictured in Dalby Forest, North Yorkshire .

"Nigel Farage today admits his party’s election prospects have been damaged by its ‘Walter Mitty’ characters. He says UKIP got it wrong in the past and now needs to show greater discipline to secure success at the ballot box. But he warned against mimicking the command and control ethos of Tony Blair's New Labour party machine, when pagers were issued to tell party members what to say at all times. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said his party will clamp down on Walter Mitty characters before next year's general election . Ukip is expected to come first in elections to the European Parliament on May 22. But Mr Farage's party has been rocked by yet more revelations about the views of candidates and councillors which risk undermining his claim to be a mainstream political force. In the run-up to last year's council elections, candidates were exposed for wearing a Jimmy Savile mask, blaming the Holocaust on Jews and branding Margaret Thatcher an 'old w****'. Just this month Mr Farage has had to suspend a councillor who blamed the winter storms on gay marriage. American humorist James Thurber wrote The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty for the New Yorker magazine in 1939. A Walter Mitty character was originally a harmless day-dreamer, who disengages from the real world by turning his small everyday failures and humiliations into grandiose fantasies, with himself cast as the hero. But over the years the name has acquired a more pejorative sense, coming to mean a self-deluding, self-aggrandising fraudster, who tries to gain respect by pretending to be something he’s not. The story has inspired not one film — the  celebrated 1947 version with Danny Kaye,  which propelled the name ‘Walter Mitty’ into the English language — but two. Ben Stiller directed, co-produced and starred in The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty released last month. Now the Ukip leader is promising tougher vetting of candidates to weed out people who could cause him embarrassment. ‘It’s very natural that a newish party will attract all sorts of people,’ he told The Times. ‘Walter Mittys seeking a role in politics – in the end they will let down not just us but themselves. ‘I need us to have a disciplined election machine.’ His comments come just a day after it emerged that a senior member of the party, Godfrey Bloom, apparently taunted a disabled student during an Oxford University debate. Mr Bloom was appearing at the debate last Thursday and asked the young man whether he was Richard III, the medieval king who suffered from a spinal deformity. Last week the party was again embarrassed by one of its more controversial members, David Silvester, who claimed recent floods were divine punishment for new gay marriage laws. Mr Farage said he wanted to ‘professionalise’ UKIP ahead of the European elections in May in which his party are expected to trouble the Conservatives. He suggested he may wish to curb the eccentricities of individual candidates and said the party must campaign together on similar issues. But Mr Farage said he did not want UKIP to turn ‘into a new Labour outfit where they’ve all got pagers on their belts and they’re told what to say and think’. Keen to appeal to blue-collar people, he . claimed a third of UKIP’s support derives from former Labour voters. He . immediately risked alienating them, however, by saying that bankers were . entitled to receive large bonuses. ‘The very thought that the bureaucrats in . Brussels now set the limits we can pay the highest earning people in . London is truly astonishing,’ he added. Mr Farage said the party need to appear more professional if they are to succeed at the ballot box. His comments come as Godfrey Bloom, pictured, appeared to taunt a disabled student during a debate at Oxford University . The stockbroker’s son said: ‘We don’t need official caps or limits being placed on these things. Don’t forget that quite a lot of this comes back to people in terms of pension incomes and the rest of it.’ Mr Farage also attacked high public sector pay, especially in local government, saying there were a ‘remarkable’ number of people working in local authorities and quangos who were on six-figure salaries. While Labour is facing a growing backlash in the business community as a result of its 50p tax rate plan, UKIP has been courting big donors as anti-Europe sentiment has increased in the City. However, Mr Farage refused to be drawn on any economic policies, nor would he be drawn into giving a date as to when the UK deficit should be cut by.","UKIP got it wrong in the past says Nigel Farage .

"Congressman Michael Grimm's ties to his former colleagues in the FBI were not as pleasant as he portrayed as a new report reveals that he was banned from the agency's offices since he left in 2006. The Republican, who was indicted two weeks ago on 20 counts including tax evasion and fraud, worked as an undercover FBI agent for years before running for office but the extent of the scorched earth he left behind was not evident until today. DNAinfo reports that security guards were given explicit orders to keep Grimm from entering either of the two New York City FBI offices after he resigned. Scroll down for video . Current office: Michael Grimm has been a New York Congressman since 2010 but he worked for the FBI for more than a decade before leaving in 2006 when he was believed to be under investigation . They even posted his photo in the security stations to make sure that the guards would not allow him in the buildings along with about two dozen other disgruntled former agents and employees. 'He is not welcome,' a former FBI official said, according to DNAinfo. The unidentified former official said that the people- like Grimm- who were banned from entering the FBI buildings 'are all employees who were fired, or they were under circumstances where they were forced out or felt they should leave, and all are no longer welcome back.' Grimm left the agency in 2006 when he was reportedly the subject of an internal review in light of two troubling concerns. Remember this face: Security guards at the New York FBI offices were given pictures of Grimm to remind them to stop him if he ever tried to enter . There were allegations that he told a female source that he was working undercover while still working on a case, and there were also questions raised about expenses he had filed. After leaving the agency, he went on to work in private businesses and got involved in a health food restaurant called Healthalicious, which has come back into the fold since the charges against him stem from allegedly illegal payment practices at the Upper East Side restaurant. In 2010, he was elected to Congress amid a wave of Tea Party support, but that didn't mean that all was forgiven over at the FBI. 'Some of us thought it was kind of a joke after he was elected to Congress that his picture stayed up,' the unidentified former FBI official said. Grimm, who was caught on camera threatening to throw a reporter off the balcony of the Capitol building earlier this year, has maintained his innocence in the tax evasion and fraud case and a spokesman denied any knowledge that he had left the FBI on bad terms. 'False rumors and malicious lies relating to the congressman’s tenure in the FBI have been reported on since 2010 and have been repeatedly refuted,' the spokesman told DNAinfo. Earlier this week, Grimm's ex-girlfriend Diana Durand entered a not guilty plea on the charges she faced for allegedly arranging accounts for fake donors to contribute to his 2010 congressional campaign. Both she and Grimm are free on bail as he awaits further hearings in his case. 'Appropriate': Speaker John Boehner accepted Grimm's offer to step down from his role on the House Financial Services Committee in light of the charges . He has maintained his innocence throughout the process and has not announced any plans to resign from his position, but he did step down from his role on the House Financial Services Committee. Grimm sent House Speaker and Majority Leader John Boehner a letter removing himself from the committee due to the arrest, but said that he hopes to be reinstated when he is cleared of all charges. He is charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and tax fraud, all of which are connected to his involvement with Healthalicious when he was an investor before launching into his political career in 2010. The lengthy indictment charges Grimm with two different types of fraud- mail and wire- as well as obstruction of justice, perjury, employing illegal immigrants, and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Connected: Grimm's ex-girlfriend Diana Durand (pictured last week) has entered a not guilty plea for the charges she faces in connection to his allegedly illegal campaign fundraising . He is accused of concealing more than $1million in receipts, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars that were kept away from employees. While helping run the Manhattan restaurant, Healthalicious, Grimm is accused of keeping two sets of payroll records. The one he turned over to the restaurant's accountants, who used them as the basis for their tax returns, showed lower payouts to employees than he was actually paying them- as he opted for cash payouts of either half or all of their earnings so that there was no trail. The perjury charge, however, comes from a deposition in January 2013 where he allegedly lied under oath. The deposition came when former employees accused Grimm of paying them less than minimum wage.","Michael Grimm was reportedly banned from entering FBI offices after he quit working as an undercover agent .

"Recently indicted Congressman Michael Grimm, best known for threatening to throw a reporter 'off a f*****g balcony', attended a sweet 16 party last weekend and set off a frenzy amongst the teen girls present as he posed for pictures. The Republican representative from New York made the special visit to a constituents birthday and his arrival caused the girls to swoon over the former Marine and one to declare him her 'bae' - slang for 'before anyone else.' The unexpected teenage freak out over the infamous Capitol Hill tough-guy sparked some fevered Twitter posts, with the same girl exclaiming, 'f*****g' Michael Grimm is going' and  that she was 'gonna dance with him all night and make him fall in love with me.' Scroll Down for Video . Before anyone Else: This is one of the tweets discovered by Business Insider of Congressman Michael Grimm's attendance at a sweet 16 birthday party over the weekend. Grimm is a friend of the girl's family and was attending for them. Her identity has been obscured in this, one of the tweets she sent . Somewhat inappropriately for the combative 44-year-old, Business Insider is reporting that Grimm told the teen that this would not be their last encounter. 'He told me he's taking me to prom I was like you fricking better,' the teen added to Twitter. Indeed, Business Insider reported that another teenage girl at the party began tweeting exited conversations she heard about Grimm between her and her friends. 'Michael Grimm is coming.' 'Oh sh** now I have to wear nice underwear,' she wrote. The tweets have since been removed from the Internet and it is not known where the party was held. Awkward: Michael Grimm's heartthrob status on Capitol Hill may be known to insiders, but it seems that teenage girls feel the same way about he controversial politician . Party hopes: The girl took to social media to tell her followers that she will be doing her best to make the ex-marine turned Republican politician fall in love with her . When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Grimm explained the congressman is a 'personal friend' of the birthday girl's family and did not just gatecrash the party. The congressman, who was briefly married in 2004, but is now single, has been labeled one of the sexiest bachelors in Congress in the past. His all-action-hero past, in which he served in the First Gulf War and for a time as a special agent with the FBI, has marked him out as an eligible bachelor on Capitol Hill. However, it seems that Grimm is never far from controversy. In September, 2013, Grimm was subject of allegations from the Brooklyn Magazine that he had acted inappropriately in public for a member of Congress. The magazine claimed that witnesses had seen him going inside a restroom with a woman for 15 minutes while at bar in the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn. The congressman, who represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, apparently spent such a 'long f*****g time' in the bar's bathroom that 'people were talking about it'. Grimm's colorful past crops up again in a 2011 New Yorker article written by Evan Ratliff about undercover FBI operations in the city. Allegedly in July, 1999, Grimm was apparently conducting an affair with a married woman while he was working with the FBI. Watch Video Here: . Bully pulpit: Rep Michael Grimm, a Republican from Staten Island, was being interviewed by NY1 about the State of the Union address when he became angry with the reporter and threatened him . Fit of rage: The 43-year-old retired Marine and former FBI agent went after Scott, threatening to throw him off the balcony . Threat of violence: Grimm (right) was caught on camera telling Scotto: 'I'll break you in half. Like a boy.' Apparently, one night in 1999, Grimm and the lady he was dating entered the Caribbean Tropics nightclub in Queens and bumped into her estranged husband. Gordon Williams, was an off-duty NYPD officer working as a bouncer at the club at the time and he broke up what turned into an altercation between the two men. However, he told the New Yorker that around 2.30am, Grimm returned for a standoff in the parking lot and was waving a gun around screaming he was going to kill the husband and saying, 'I'm a f*****g FBI agent, ain't nobody going to threaten me.' However, Grimm is most famous for allegations of fraud and for threatening the life of a reporter who asked him questions he did not like. In April, Grimm was charged with 20 criminal counts addressing different fraud allegations after turning himself in to FBI headquarters in Manhattan. The Republican representative from Staten Island entered a not guilty plea to a U.S. Magistrate in connection to all 20 counts which include several fraud charges relating to a health food store that he ran before running for Congress. He is charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and tax fraud, all of which are connected to his involvement in an Upper East Side restaurant where he was an investor before launching into his political career in 2010. Facing charges: Congressman Michael Grimm turned himself in to the FBI in April (pictured) after it became clear that they will be filing charges against him in connection to a restaurant he was involved in before being elected to Congress . The bulk of the alleged crimes themselves took place before he was a Congressman, and he is accused of concealing more than $1million in receipts, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars that were kept away from employees. Grimm, 44, is familiar with the FBI headquarters as he worked for the agency for more than a decade before leaving in 2006. 'As a former F.B.I. agent, Representative Grimm should understand the motto: fidelity, bravery and integrity,'  F.B.I. assistant director George Venizelos said in a statement. 'Yet he broke our credo at nearly every turn. In this 20-count indictment, Representative Grimm lived by a new motto: fraud, perjury and obstruction.' And in January, Grimm stormed off during a live television broadcast when NY1 reporter Michael Scotto tried to ask him about a controversy over his campaign finances - but Grimm returned to confront the TV news man. Investigation: Diana Drumond (right) who was . previously in a romantic relationship with Grimm (left) was charged in April with lying to the FBI and making up false donors to illegally . funnel his campaign money . Conducting their interview around the balcony of the Capitol, Grimm squared up to Scotto and told him 'you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony' before threatening to break Scotto in half 'like a boy'. The incident was caught on camera, showing how Grimm cut the interview short after refusing to answer questions about the probe. Although the audio in the clip that captured the exchange is very low, a transcript provided by NY1 shows that at one point Grimm said to Scott: 'Let me be clear to you, you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony.’ The reporter attempted to defend himself, pointing out that he simply wanted to ask ‘a valid question.’ In response, Grimm told him: 'No, no, you're not man enough, you're not man enough. I'll break you in half. Like a boy.’ In the wake of the incident, Grimm released an unapologetic statement claiming that he was ‘extremely annoyed’ because he was doing NY1 a favor by agreeing to do their interview first. ‘The reporter knew that I was in a hurry and was only there to comment on the State of the Union, but insisted on taking a disrespectful and cheap shot at the end of the interview, because I did not have time to speak off-topic,’ Grimm said.","The Republican Congressman for New York City arrived at the party over the weekend .

"Claim: U.S. Congressman Michael Grimm is alleged to have had sex in the bathroom of a bar . A Republican congressman has been accused of having sex in the bathroom of a bar after spending more than 15 minutes locked away with a female friend. Michael Grimm, who represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn in New York, was apparently seen behaving intimately with the woman before following her into the toilet. The 43-year-old denies the claims, saying they are an 'absurd distortion' invented by his political opponents. Two weeks ago, Mr Grimm spent an evening with a friend at The Owl's Head in Bay Ridge, a Brooklyn neighbourhood which falls within his congressional district. The pair appeared very close, witnesses told Brooklyn Magazine, with the congressman repeatedly placing his hand in his companion's back pocket. At one point they went into the bar's only toilet and stayed there for 17 minutes, a bystander told the New York Post. They were apparently locked in the small room for so long that other bar patrons started talking about them, with one saying: 'I think he was in there having sex.' 'It just so happened a couple people [at the bar] knew exactly who he was and kept an eye on him,' a Democratic source told the Post. 'They said Grimm was in there with a girl for 17 minutes. I guess they were timing him. They were absolutely appalled.' A witness told Brooklyn Magazine: 'I was surprised someone so sleazy could be a congressman.' Denial: Mr Grimm, a Republican, claims that the rumour was invented by his Democratic rivals . Mr Grimm, a former FBI agent who was first elected to Congress in 2010, was briefly married in the mid-1990s but is now single. He denied the claim that he had had sex in a bar, saying in a statement: 'This never happened and I will not dignify this absurd distortion of the facts with a response, except to to say that this is nothing more than a typical Democrat-led smear campaign.' A source close to the congressman told the Post that the pair were 'old friends', and that he went into the bathroom to 'check on her' because she was distressed. The owner of the bar told Politicker that he was not present at the time of the alleged incident and did not know anything about it, adding: 'I've never seen him before.'","Michael Grimm was seen 'getting close to a female friend' in a Brooklyn bar .

"A Texas businesswoman who at one time dated embattled Republican U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm has pleaded not guilty to three federal felony charges, in a campaign finance violation case that has linked her with the congressman. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn unsealed her January indictment against Diana Durand in April after she reportedly refused to help them build a stronger case against the congressman. Durand appeared Monday in the same federal courtroom where Grimm proclaimed his innocence a week ago before returning to work on Capitol Hill. Her indictment says she caused  $10,600 in donations to be made in the names of other Americans between November 2009 and October 2010, and then later reimbursed the donors. She is also accused of lying in June 2012 when she told the FBI she didn't reimburse straw donors for their contributions to Grimm's campaign. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Diana Durand (C), ex-girlfriend and former fundraiser for Republican U.S. Representative Michael Grimm, Legal trouble: Diana Durand, pictured in February with her lawyer Stuart Kaplan outside Federal Court in Brooklyn, was indicted Friday on federal charges that she made campaign contributions that exceeded federal caps in 2010 by paying others to make the donations . Durand, described by her lawyer as 'not a sophisticated woman,' allegedly funneled her own money to Grimm's campaign through 'straw donors' Durand's . attorney Stuart Kaplan told reporters outside the courthouse that 'my client is not a sophisticated woman.' 'It's just an unfortunate scenario,' Kaplan added, according to the New York Daily News. Durand and Grimm met in Texas before he ran . for Congress. Kaplan insisted Monday after a brief arraignment hearing that Durand had no idea she was doing anything illegal when she reimbursed . He also said she would refuse to testify against Grimm even though federal prosecutors offered her a deal. 'If the congressman was not part of her relationship we probably would not be standing here today,' he said. 'When you take out . their relationship, there's no evidence to connect either one with . respect to complicity, violating the law by acting in concert or doing . something as a criminal enterprise,' he said. Durand, an executive with the oil and energy company RelaDyne, has said through her lawyer that she didn't intend to do anything wrong. ‘She was just trying to help this guy out who she was in a relationship with – nothing more, nothing less,’ Kaplan said in April. If convicted, Durand faces up to eight years in prison and a $600,000 fine. New York Rep. Micheal Grimm faces his own indictment on federal charges related to the alleged concealment of more than $1 million in his former company's income from federal and state governments . Legal trouble: Durand, pictured in February with her lawyer Stuart Kaplan, faces a possible 8-year prison sentence is she's convicted on all three counts . Grimm faces his own felony charges in . a case that began as an investigation into his campaign finances but . quickly grew to encompass his business activities with a company called . Healthalicious before he was elected to Congress. On . April 28 prosecutors unsealed a 20-count indictment claiming that . Grimm, a second-term congressman, played a part in concealing more than . $1 million in the company's sales and wages from tax authorities with . both the federal government and the state of New York state. Durand, an oil and gas executive, may have a hard time convincing a federal court that she was ignorant of campaign finance laws . He is free on $400,000 bond, and has insisted that he will beat the charges and run for a third term. A . House Ethics Committee had already announced in November 2013 that Grimm was under . investigation for possible campaign finance violations but said it would . defer its inquiry because of a separate Department of Justice . investigation. Grimm's attorney, William McGinley, said following his client's indictment that he wasn't surprised by the charges. 'After more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. Attorney's Office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges against Congressman Grimm,' he said in a statement. He added, 'When the dust settles, he will be vindicated.' In January a New York City reporter tried to question Grimm about the investigation, and the congressman infamously threatened to throw him off a balconyon Capitol Hill. Grimm granted NY1 reporter Michael Scotto an exclusive interview after president Obama's State of the Union Address. Rather than ask the Congressman about the President's speech, the reporter asked Grimm about his run-in with the law. When the interview was over and Grimm thought he was no longer being taped, he told Scotto, 'Let me be clear to you, you ever do that to me again I’ll throw you off this f***ing balcony.' Grimm first released a statement criticizing Scotto for what the Congressman felt were 'disrespectful and cheap shots.' He ended up apologizing after it became clear that few others felt his behavior toward the reporter was appropriate.

"With their legs outstretched and bodies artfully poised, these male praying mantises look as though they are about to bust a move on the insect version of Strictly Come Dancing. But these other-worldly insects should be warned, because if they attract a female of the species it could be their last dance.

"A father-of-two who was given a mandatory 20-year prison sentence for firing a warning shot at a thug who threatened his family says he has lost everything and insists he did nothing wrong. Lee Wollard, 59, from Devenport, Florida, was given the lengthy term after a jury found him guilty of aggravated assault, shooting a firearm inside a building and child endangerment in 2008. The incident which led to his incarceration took place when the biologist, who used to work at Sea World, was having a nap but was woken by his 16-year-old daughter Sarah and her boyfriend fighting. 'Everything is gone': Lee Wollard, 59, from Devenport, Florida, was given the lengthy term after a jury found him guilty of aggravated assault, shooting a firearm inside a building and child endangerment in 2008 . He and his wife Debbie had taken the 17-year-old in because he was homeless, but the relationship began to deteriorate. When Wollard heard a loud crash, he loaded his .357 and went into the room, firing into the wall to scare him off. It prompted the boy to leave straight away. Speaking to CBS News, he said: 'We had tried calling the cops. We had tried doing everything. Nothing worked. Nothing. 'So I fire a warning shot into the wall, [and] I said, 'The next one is between your eyes'.' After the teenager hurried from the property, the family thought their dilemma was over, but they were wrong. Wollard was charged and then sentenced to 20 years in Florida state prison by Judge Donald Jacobson. 'And I was just like, 'What?'' recalled Wollard. 'You know, the blood just drained out of my head. I almost passed out.' Scared: The father-of-two loaded his magnum when the boyfriend of her daughter Sarah (second left) started threatening her and his family. He fired a warning shot into the wall beside him . Cost: Six years into his prison term (pictured right with his wife Debbie during a visit) he insists he did nothing wrong but says the punishment is a 'bargain' because his family is alive because of his actions . An aggravated assault involving a firearm in Florida comes with a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years. Wollard was given a plea offer of probation and no jail time but he declined, convinced he was innocent. He said: 'It never dawned on me that I would lose, because I hadn't done anything wrong. I'd protected my family, and I didn't even hurt anybody. Everything is gone.' The judge told him that he would not have given him such a length sentence if he hadn't been obligated to do so. He said: 'It didn't matter that Lee Wollard was a first offender, or that no one was physically injured. In Florida, a conviction for aggravated assault involving a firearm means an automatic 20 years. That's the mandatory minimum sentence. 'I looked at him and told him, 'I would not be sentencing you to this term of incarceration, 20 years Florida state prison, if it were not for the fact that I was obligated under my oath as a judge to do so.' Decision: Wollard (pictured with his wife and two children) was given a plea offer by prosecutors but he declined because he was convinced he would win . Prosecutors believe that mandatory sentencing laws prompt defendants to opt for a plea bargain rather than going through a lengthy trial. He said: 'It never dawned on me that I would lose because I haven't done anything wrong. In Florida if you kill someone when standing your ground then you may face no prison time at all. If he serves the full sentence, Wollard will be let out in 2028, when he is 73-years-old. But he believes it is a 'bargain'. 'As bizarre as it sounds, if this is what the State of Florida requires of you to make sure your family is safe, I'm willing to do it,' he said. 'It's a bargain. I've got three family members, my two daughters and my wife, and they're alive. They're alive because of this. It's a bargain. Twenty years is a bargain.'","Lee Wollard from Devenport, Florida, was given mandatory sentence in 2008 .

"Demi Moore was rushed to hospital last night to be treated for problems rumoured to be related to 'substance abuse' and 'anorexia', it has been claimed. The 49-year-old actress, who has appeared increasingly frail in recent weeks, was taken to hospital by ambulance following a call to 911 just before 11pm last night after the actress allegedly suffered a seizure. The mother-of-three was with a female friend when she allegedly began shaking, it has been reported. After being admitted to hospital, website Radar claim she is being treated for anorexia, among other substance abuse issues. The news emerged as her young . husband, 33, from whom she is estranged, was pictured enjoying a beer as he . partied with friends at a Bruno Mars gig in Brazil.

A source told Radar: 'She collapsed after having an epileptic seizure... she has not taken care of her health at all lately and has lost a ton of weight.' 'Demi is in getting treated for anorexia, as well as other issues that caused her seizure,' the source added. In the weeks before her hospitalisation, Demi was spotted letting loose on a wild night out with her daughter Rumer, 23. On the night of January 11 she joined her eldest child at Hollywood hot spot Beacher's Madhouse where sources tell Us Weekly magazine she was 'table . dancing while three guys sat there watching.' At least one onlooker claims she appeared intoxicated, although others only saw her drinking Red Bull. Representatives for the star refused to directly comment on the substance abuse allegations. But her spokesperson said the actress is seeking 'professional assistance' after the stresses of recent months. Moving on: The Two And A Half Men star is said to be dating someone his own age . Demi and Ashton's six year marriage . foundered in 2011 after Star magazine's shock report that Ashton cheated . on Demi with starlet Sara Leal the weekend of their wedding . anniversary. She announced that she was separating from him but has yet to file divorce papers. According to TMZ a 911 call was . placed at 10:45pm last night. The actress was assessed at home before . being taken to a local hospital. Her spokesperson told . MailOnline in a statement: ‘Because of the stresses in her life right now, Demi has . chosen to seek professional assistance to treat her exhaustion and . improve her overall health. 'She looks forward to getting well and is . grateful for the support of her family and friends.’ Unaware: Demi's estranged husband Ashton was seen out drinking beer at a Bruno Mars Concert in Brazil last night while Demi was rushed to hospital . Demi's frail and gaunt appearance in recent weeks has caused considerable concern. The . actress, who announced last November that she was divorcing husband . Ashton Kutcher, has lost a considerable amount of weight over the past . four . months. And today it was announced she has pulled out of a cameo appearance in the film about porn star Linda Lovelace  in which she had been cast as feminist icon Gloria Steinem. While Demi is seeking treatment her estranged husband is currently in Sao Paulo where he has been attending the Fashion Week.

Party hard: Ashton seen leaving the concert in Sao Paulo with a female friend . Demi last appeared in public on January 14 at the Cinema For Peace event at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills. Her frail appearance shocked fans, . although she appears to have been losing weight steadily since claims . emerged Ashton had cheated on her with 22-year-old Sara Leal. Demi, . who looked a shadow of her former self, wore a slim fitting black dress . which showed just how much weight she had lost from her usually toned . physique. On November 17 2011, Demi announced that she was filing for divorce from her toyboy husband after six years of marriage. In happier and healthier times: Demi and her estranged husband Ashton Kutcher in February last year before they split . In a statement she said: 'It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton. 'As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life.' He is now reportedly dating screenwriter Lorene Scafaria, who, at 33, is his own age. The pair spent Christmas together in Europe. Earlier this month Demi was seen in a parking lot with a 26-year-old actor and personal trainer Blake Corl-Baietti. Her representatives refused to comment on speculation that the actress was in a relationship with the younger man. Demi recently opened up about her fears and heartache in an interview with US Harper's Bazaar. Changing shape: Demi was looking frail in October in the wake of news . her husband had cheated on her, seen looking healthier in 2009 . She admitted: ‘What scares me is that I’m going to ultimately find out at the end of my life that I’m really not lovable, that I’m not worthy of being loved. 'That there’s something fundamentally wrong with me.’ As well as speaking out about her anxieties, she also opened up about her body image. The actress - who went through a gruelling fitness regime for her role in GI Jane - admitted to having had a ‘love-hate relationship’ with her body but said she had a more positive view of it now. She said: ‘I sit today in a place of greater acceptance of my body and that includes not just my weight but all of the things that come with your changing body as you age to now experiencing my body as extremely thin.’ Demi added: ‘Thin in a way that I never imagined somebody would be saying to me, “You’re too thin, and you don’t look good"".'","Actress 'collapsed after epileptic seizure'

"Football star Matthew Stafford narrowly avoided a collapsing pedestrian bridge on a Detroit freeway this morning. Stafford, quarterback for the Detroit Lions, was driving to practice when the bridge was hit by waste haulage truck with its boom up, which knocked down the structure. State police confirmed that the man died as the huge clean-up operation began, leaving traffic backed up for miles. Scroll down for video . Collapse: The bridge came down over the Southfield Freeway in Detroit early this morning . Caught in the chaos: Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was seen near the collapsed bridge at around 6am . Carnage: The bridge's concrete pillars were wrenched from their station when the truck collided with them . Stafford was among those stranded by the accident, but was picked up by the Lions' head of security and was taken on to practice. A truck driver is dead after smashing into a bridge over a freeway, bringing it crashing to the ground. The 15ft pedestrian bridge, which crossed the Southfield Freeway in Detroit, Michigan, was left a mangled wreck after the collision just before 6am today. State police confirmed that the driver of the truck was killed. He was taken from the scene by stretcher and pronounced dead at a hospital. Brought down: The 15ft bridge - which was in 'fair to good' condition, according to authorities, was left blocking the road . The road was closed - with transport authorities predicting that the wreckage could take days to clear, WXYZ-TV reported. The road was closed from Interstate 96 to Joy Road - a distance of around a mile and a half. It is believed that the truck, a waste haulage vehicle, had its boom raised when it drove into the bridge. Speaking from the football pitch this afternoon, Stafford told CBS: 'Obviously you don’t expect to see a bridge down, you know, on the highway. 'But I was just mostly worried about trying to get her as fast as I could; and, obviously, the health of the driver.' Twisted: The bridge left traffic backed up for miles on the Southfield Freeway . Before: The bridge, on the Southfield Freeway in Detroit, as it appeared before the crash . Michigan State Police Lt. Michael Shaw said: 'When the boom struck the bridge, it actually pulled the bridge down with it.' 'It's just the beginning of rush hour, so nobody else was struck. If this would have happened maybe an hour later it would have been a lot worse.' Nobody was on the bridge at the time. State transportation officials said the bridge was in 'fair to good' condition, meaning that it was safe for use before being hit by the truck. Shaw said the driver was taken to a hospital and died, but he didn't have details about what caused the driver's death. The driver's identity has not been released. Smash: This truck - believed to be the one which brought down the bridge - was pictured not far from the scene this morning . Barnika Cage, who lives a block from the bridge, told The Detroit News she heard a 'boom' sound, went down the street and saw that the bridge had fallen. She said she saw a man get out of the truck, stumble, and then fall face first on the grass along the freeway. She said: 'There was blood all over his face. I was just praying he was OK.' Traffic is backed up for miles in both directions at the scene, and officials are urging drivers to take different routes. The I-96 freeway was closed temporarily but is now open as usual. According to MDOT, the wreckage of the bridge will start to be removed this morning. Officials couldn't say for sure how long the roadway would be closed. Fragment: This piece of a vehicle was seen under the bridge - leading to speculation that it was the piece which struck the bridge .","Truck 'with raised boom' smashed into 15ft bridge near Detroit around 6am .

"This is the moment locals managed to pull a giraffe free after it became stuck in a muddy river at a luxury safari reserve in Northern Kenya. The rescue effort at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Laikipia took several hours, but the mature bull placidly allowed conservationists to come to his aid. The exhausted animal, which had been struggling for some time to extract itself, immediately took a nap after it was pulled to safety, before getting back on its feet. Dramatic rescue: Conservationists came to the aid of a male giraffe who became stuck in the mud in Kenya . Saving the day: The incident occurred at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Laikipia this week . Exhausted: The mature bull, who had struggled for hours, promptly took a nap after his dramatic ordeal . A dozen staff from both Lewa and the reserve's luxury safari lodge, Sirikoi, rushed to the aid of the bull, who had wandered into the mud while on his way to visit his girlfriend Nditu's, the lodge's resident giraffe. A Sirikoi staffmember happened upon the distressed animal and sounded the alarm. The conservationists moved the bull onto its side to check its legs were not broken. They then extracted the animal from the mud by using a sling to drag him onto the bank. His eyes were covered during the process to reduce stress. Back on his feet: The majestic animal emerged unscathed and wandered off after his snooze . Giraffe rescues are a rare occurrence, as the animals are usually very careful and manage to avoid the mud, a spokesperson for the safari told MailOnline Travel. In comparison buffalo and elephant frequently find themselves in a sticky situation. Rose Hipwood, founder of The Luxury Safari Company said: 'Rescues like this are rare, but Lewa and Sirikoi boast some of Africa's most experienced conservationists so the wildlife in these areas (and many other areas of Africa) benefit from the highest level of knowledge when it comes to preserving them.' Safari in style: The reserve is home to Sirikoi, a luxurious game lodge . Sirikoi, on the slopes of Mount Kenya, is considered one of the most luxurious game lodges in the country. 'Sirikoi has arguably better game viewing than the Masai Mara - it is one of Kenya's most luxurious lodges and the highlight here is the guest and lodge's involvement in the many conservation initiatives based at Lewa,' Hipwood added.","Mature bull became stuck at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in northern Kenya .

"The bulldog, pictured with owner Hayley Sandiford. She had been ordered to keep her dog under control or have him put down . A dangerous bulldog faces being put down after it terrorised local postmen who then refused to deliver to its owner's whole street - meaning dozens of families have been forced to walk miles to collect their post. The seven stone American bulldog, named Winston, was under threat of a death sentence in court today after his attacks sparked a health and safety enquiry. His repeated attacks on postmen led to a ban on all postal deliveries to the whole of Worcester Street in Blackburn, Lancashire, which came into force in February this year. Residents from the 60 homes affected have had to travel two miles to collect their mail from the Blackburn delivery office. And one disabled neighbour, who feared he had cancer, missed an important letter from the hospital because it remained undelivered due to the ban. Clive Fisher, 69, was waiting for a letter from Royal Blackburn Hospital oncology unit after being referred by his GP because he was exhibiting signs of cancer. He said: 'An appointment letter was left undelivered and at the sorting office for days because of that dog. 'There's only a short time to treat disorders like this and I know there's a lot of people on this road with illnesses or disabilities. 'I'm disabled but I'm lucky I have a car. A lot of my neighbours don't, or are unable to drive.' One postman reported being bitten on the arm and had to kick the dog twice in the head to fend him off. Another said Winston bounded 100 yards towards him before clamping his teeth around the mailbag. He had to cower behind a tree and throw his one remaining letter to distract the animal before diving behind a gate and alerting a colleague to take cover. Winston's owner Hayley Sandiford was ordered to keep her dog under control or face having him put down under a Contingent Destruction Order after one of the postmen told JPs at Blackburn magistrates' court of his ordeal and warned the dog would attack again. Now the dog must remain muzzled and kept on a harness with two dog leads no more than six feet long whenever he is taken out for walks. He must also only be accompanied by a person over 16. Miss Sandiford was also ordered to keep her home securely fenced and locked and must obtain third party insurance for the animal. The mother-of-two pleaded guilty to being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control and was handed a six month community order with a six month supervision requirement. She must pay prosecution costs of £85 and a victim surcharge of £60 and attend dog behaviour sessions. Winston the bulldog's (left) owner Hayley Sandiford was ordered to keep him muzzled and on a leash no more than six feet long when he is taken out for walks. Right, a sign has been put on her door with a warning to check the bulldog can't escape . But after the case, Miss Sandiford insisted her dog is not dangerous but a 'softie'. She said: 'I'm already doing the things the court wants but as far I'm concerned my dog isn't dangerous and not the Devil Dog that some people seem to think he is. Winston is brilliant with my kids and he is just a softie. 'Unfortunately he does have a thing about postmen but it is the mail they carry and not the postmen themselves.' She added: 'If I thought my dog was a danger to any kids or any other people I wouldn't be able to live with myself and I wouldn't put anybody's life at risk. 'If I even had one per cent doubt in my mind that he would turn he would be gone no matter how much I love him. 'Winston did jump up at the postman - but he is a very bouncy playful little thing and he forgets how big he is - although I accept it must have been scary for the postman. 'Anyone who knows my dog will say he doesn't have it in him to hurt anyone. As soon as I shouted 'Winston stop' and pulled him back he stopped straight away. It wasn't a vicious attack because if it was he would not have let go of the postman. People are going to be mad about the post but there is no reason why they shouldn't deliver the post now.' The court heard Winston bit an unnamed postmen on the arm whilst being taken for a walk by the owner's nine-year-old son in February this year. Royal Mail found there was an 'unacceptable level of risk associated with deliveries' in Worcester Road, Blackburn (pictured) and a ban on all deliveries was put in force in February . The postman suffered a bite suffered a bite wound which broke the skin and he received medical treatment in hospital as a result. No action was initially taken against the animal, but on July 9 the 'thick set and stocky built' dog atrtacked postman Paul Warnock while he was on his round. Mr Warnock said: 'Straight away I was worried because it was quite a big dog/ . 'As soon as it spotted me it came running towards me fast, at speed. 'Then it was showing it's teeth and growling at me. It was coming at me aggressively, I was frightened. I was backing off then all of a sudden it went for me it grabbed the bundle of mail. It was in the middle of the street because I was backing off so much.' Mr Warnock ran behind a tree for cover and added: 'When I got behind the tree I saw a gate, I thought if I can get inside the gate it's safe. I was left with one letter. It was still going for me. I had one piece on mail, I threw it to take it's eye off me and ran behind the gate. It would have attacked me in the street.' 'When I got behind the gate the dog was roaming the street. I saw my colleague further up the street coming down, he heard the commotion. I shouted 'get back get back, dog lose on the street. ' His colleague took cover behind a gate and watched Miss Sandiford get hold of the dog. Mr Warnock said: 'I was more worried about the bundle of mail in the middle of the road, that's my job to look after it. 'We got in our van and just drove to safety two streets away because we were that frightened. I don't do around there anymore. The Dangerous Dogs Act was introduced in 1991 as a means of keeping vulnerable people and children safe from animals. Prohibited breeds are so because they have been bred for their abilities to fight. Banned dogs include the pit bull terrier, Japanese tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Braziliero and any other considered by the Secretary of State to have been bred for fighting. Banned breeds cannot be kept, bred, sold or exchanged under the law. Anyone who owns a banned breed cannot take it out in public without a muzzle. If a person commits an Dangerous Dogs related offence, they can be disqualified for dog ownership and be ordered to have the animal put down. I believe that dog should be removed from these premises. I think it will attack again, there's no doubt in my mind it will attack again.' Miss Sandiford's lawyer Gareth Price said that since the incident she had been making 'positive steps' to make sure that there was no repeat and was engaging with her landlords at Twin Valley Homes. He added that a dog expert had observed that the dog was 'properly trained' and had 'adequate training'. Passing sentence JP Jan Alcock said of the contingent destruction order: 'You must understand it is like a suspended sentence for the dog. 'It is entirely your responsibility to keep the dog alive. If you break the conditions the police will take the dog and it will be destroyed so it is on your head.' The Royal Mail confirmed a health and safety assessment had been carried out on Miss Sandiford's neighbourhood which highlighted an 'unacceptable level of risk associated with deliveries.' A spokesman said 'Suspending deliveries is a last resort but we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously. We apologise to all affected customers.' Recent figures have said on average nine postmen a day are attacked by dogs - around 3,300 attacks a year.","Winston the American bulldog bit the arm of one postman and ran at another, clamping his teeth on the mailbag .

"Beloved entertainer Neil Patrick Harris has revealed how he first told his mother he thought he was gay when he was just 13 - after he was drawn to guys in a 'tingly kind of way'. The 41-year-old star told how he opened up to his mother Sheila in 1986 after he developed a crush on the trumpet player in his middle school band, and said: 'Mom, I'm afraid I'm gay'. But in his new autobiography, the recently married, father-of-two, said his mother simply replied that although it may be a phase, it would not make any difference in how much his parents loved him. He writes: 'And she sees that even though you date some really nice girls through your high school years, it's the cute new boy in your class or on set who really gets under your skin and thrills you and spurs your imagination. Scroll down for video . Happy: Neil Patrick Harris is now married and the father of twins - but admits in his new autobiography it took him years to admit he was gay . Teenage star: Neil Patrick Harris rose to fame as prodigal doctor Doogie Howser M.D. in 1980s TV hit . In Choose Your Own Autobiography, NPH reveals how he experimented with psychedelic drugs to try and expand his mind - and jokes how a kiss on the mouth from Burt Reynolds during filming on B.L. Stryker may have sealed the deal that he was gay. In the book, which offers fans the chance to take their own path while recounting moments of his life, NPH - who found fame aged 16 on 80s TV hit, Doogie Howser, M.D - acknowledges that throughout the show's run his 'actual sexual identity at this time is a mystery, even to you. Especially to you.' And he admits that it took years for him to come to terms with his sexuality, labeling himself bisexual before telling his parents he was gay. His mother, he says, was accepting, while his dad Ronald took a while to come to terms with news. Still, he says:  'You've come a long way from the anonymous skulker trolling the AOL chat rooms.' And he declares: 'You are gay. You know that you are; you like that you are; you’re proud that you are. You are totally gay. and now you are totally gay and totally in love, and it’s wonderful’. ‘After a long internal journey, you now embrace being gay, recognizing it as a wonderful and integrally important component part of the totality that is you’. ‘You are full out…to yourself’.' While now a feted star of TV, movies and Broadway, having recently won a Tony award for Hedwig and the Angry Inch and now appearing in box office hit Gone Girl, NPH admits that after Doogie Howser ended in 1993, he struggled to find work. He was, he said, forever pigeon-holed as the sweet-faced, teenage doctor. Finding audio lectures by Tony Robbins helpful, NPH attended weekend seminars by the self-help guru in Hawaii, which he found 'transformative'. And while on a bid to expand his mind and horizons, the actor visited childhood friends Louis and Elizabeth Rutherford in New Mexico. Happy to be as far removed from Hollywood, he spent time hiking and mountain climbing, eventually moving to Placitas for 'eighteen wonderful months'. There was, he says, a brief experiment with psychedelic drugs. He was, however, 'one of the few people to find the drug neither transcendent nor horrific, just kinda weird.' Precocious: Starting acting as a child, Neil Patrick Harris has now won a Tony and an Emmy for his work. His new autobiography is out today . Acknowledging he was bisexual - which seemed like a 'half-truth, but the only truth' he knew at the time, NPH went on to guest star in TV sitcoms and dramas. It was while appearing on B.K.Stryker that show star Burt Reynolds kissed him. NPH writes: 'As a joke at the end of one take, Burt leans over and kisses you square on the mouth. The crew thinks this is very funny, but it makes you uncomfortable. Uncomfortable and, it will ultimately turn out, gay. Burt Reynolds' kiss makes you gay.' Struggling to come to terms with his sexuality, the entertainer had his first gay liaison with a co-star called Andy, with whom he appeared in a 1997 production of the musical Rent. He says: 'On the plus side, you did have an orgasm', as he calls their meetings 'a tentative first step towards a new life'. However, the sporadic hook-ups are not enough and he wanted more, he says, prompting him to go on online chatrooms, where he sent pictures of body parts to strangers - and leading to a clandestine hook-up, where he spent the whole time with a baseball cap low over his head. While visiting a friend in Germany, NPH said he feels 'anonymous' and visited a loud, punk-industrial gay dance club. Here, for the first time, he says, he danced for the purposes of seduction. He started making out with a man called Christophe and it was a big step, 'so, so great'. The pair ended up in bed and 'it's fantastic', despite the fact NPH spoke no German and Christophe barely no English . All smiles: NPH, David Burkta and their twins. The star tells of his love for his husband in his autobiography . Cuties: Gideon and Harper celebrated their fourth birthdays on Monday. Neil Patrick Harris and his husband David Burkta posted pictures of the tots as NPH wrote: 'I can't believe that you used to be tiny baby things. And now, this' Family: Neil Patrick Harris met David Burkta in 2003 upon a chance meeting on the street in New York. They married in Italy in September and are the parents of twins Gideon and Harper - and live together in Manhattan . The star writes, 'So you smoke cigarettes laced with hashish...and it goes on all night and you don't want it to the end.' But it is his meeting with David Burktka, the love of his life and now his husband, that forever changed NPH's life. The pair originally met in 2003 when he was in New York to star in Cabaret when NPH bumped into his Into the Woods co-star Kate Reinders, who was accompanied by a 'rakishly handsome James Dean-like hot dud in a leather jacket and T-shrt with a little gray hair, which is always a plus.' David 'puts out his hand with great indifference', and when he turned away, NPH congratulated Kate on her new love - only for her to reply: 'David? Oh, no, he's totally gay,' as NPH writes: 'Contrary to popular belief, gaydar technology is still imperfect, even among gays...And David isn't swishy. The right man: NPH says in his book that when he went on his first date with David Burkta it was 'natural' and 'familiar', adding: 'It's as cosy as an old shoe. You've met the right man, and luckily you've done so at the right time' However, David WAS in a relationship with a Hollywood publicist, one whom had 'the power to sabotage your career with one swift broad-stroke email.' But when that ended, the pair went out on the date and he reminisces: 'It's natural. it's familiar. it's as cozy as an old shoe. You've met the right man, and luckily you've done so at the right time'. NPH publicly came out as gay in November 2006, saying: 'I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love.' Stunning: Neil Patrick Harris, David Burkta and their twins following their Italian wedding in September . I Do: NPH and David Burkta say their vows. NPH writes: 'Now you are totally gay, and totally in love, and it's wonderful' On set: NPH preparing for Gone Girl, the movie adaptation of the hit book by Gillian Flynn. It stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike . After releasing his 'Gaytease-burg' address to People magazine, NPH admits: 'The most gratifying reaction was the deafening silence of hundreds of millions of Americans thinking to themselves, who gives a s**t’?' He married David in Italy in September with close friend Sir Elton John performing and Pam Fryer, the director of his long-running sitcom How I Met Your Mother, officiating.

"A restaurateur couple made infamous by an episode of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares have been caught on camera in a furious row with an irate and 'drunken' customer. Video from TMZ shows furious Samy Bouzaglo, Amy's Baking Company in Scottsdale, Phoenix, as he appears to chase down a customer with what has been claimed to be a knife, but which Samy now insists is a pen. Holding him back is similarly hot-headed wife Amy Bouzaglo, who a witness said had just kicked out the patron her husband was trying to chase down. And today, Amy told MailOnline the incident kicked off after a drunken customer came in and was abusive to her and husband Samy, saying: 'The guy told us 'You're a f***ing piece of s**t.' Scroll down for video . Shocking: Video from TMZ shows the couple behind Amy's Baking Company in Phoenix as irate husband Samy Bouzaglo appears to chase down a customer while brandishing an object that he claims is a 'big pen' Furious: Amy tries to hold back Samy during the altercation. Amy claims the man in the confrontation with Samy told him: 'You're a f***ing piece of s***' Back off: Amy claimed the man was 'looking for trouble' and was clearly drunk when he entered the bakery . Traumatized: Amy, who filmed the incident herself, said the man was giving them abuse about the show . Amy - who says she is 'traumatized' by the incident - continued: 'We are trying to rebuild our business, we've been bullied for the past 18 months and just when we're trying to clear our name this happens.' The blonde continued: 'Everything has been positive and we're moving on, then out of the blue, at 4.30pm on Saturday, this man came in with two people, screaming, and he was so drunk you could smell the alcohol across the room. 'I was busy, I just made a bunch of eclairs and was instagramming and this guy yells 'what is this - seat yourself?!' 'I said to Samy 'these guys came for trouble', they started to walk over towards our back booth and sat themselves down. 'Samy went over and said 'Sir, I'm very sorry, I cannot have you here. You appear to be drunk, I politely ask you to leave'. The guy said 'fine you can do whatever you want....I just came to take a p*ss all over your walls anyway'.' Amy claims that similar threats have been sent to the couple online, adding: 'This guy stops and he says 'You're a f***ing piece of s**t, I saw the show, I saw the show'. 'Samy said 'f**k you', and the guy started to walk away. Samy said 'What the f**k? You said you were going to come and p*ss all over my walls?' 'The guy stopped, he turns around and then he started running towards me, Samy was on the patio, so I ran around the guy to block him and I was screaming 'stop him', I filmed him the whole time and he was charging towards me' 'Samy grabbed me and pulled me inside, he had a silver pen in his hand, it was not a knife, it was a big pen. 'Once we got inside, oh my God, we were traumatized. ' Infamous: Amy and Samy Bouzaglo look displeased with Gordon Ramsay before he walked out of their restaurant on the most explosive episode of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares in May 2013 . Death threats: Samy and Amy told MailOnline last year how they were bombarded by death threats following their appearance on the Fox show, Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares . The Bouzaglos now plan to contact police, but Amy said: 'I’m traumatized by what’s happened, I don’t know what is going out – we’re still here fighting! We're bleeding money, we're hoping and dreaming we can turn things around for the better.' In the video published on TMZ, Samy can be seen lunging at the patron with an object. 'It's not worth it,' says a voice from behind the camera, 'You're going to go to jail for the rest of your life.' Amy Bouzaglo holds her husband back as he moans to her, 'Let me.' The video soon cuts forward in time to when Amy becomes the enraged one. 'You m***** f****** piece of s*** coward' she yells down the street to someone out of camera view. For those who saw the couple on their TV debut last year, this anger episode comes as no big surprise. Amy's Baking Company became the subject of ridicule when it featured on Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. Footage before Ramsay arrived showed diners waiting more than hour for their meals, with Mrs Bouzaglo cooking each meal one at a time. One told the Phoenix New Times: 'You could hear Amy yelling in the kitchen and Samy was running all over the dining room. New menu: The Bouzaglos say they have spent the past 18 months trying to rebuild their business in Phoenix, Arizona and this Wednesday will debut a new menu with lighter fare . Proud: Amy says she has been posting pictures of her pastries on Instagram - and in November will release her own cookbook, Baking With Amy, saying: 'It's all fun, the message is 'make cake, not war' 'Other tables were complaining and people were leaving because they were waiting so long for their food. My partner and I had reservations for 6:45. By 9:30, we still hadn't received our pizza.' And when one customer confronted Ms Bouzaglo about the fact he still had not been served he as told to 'go f*** yourself.' Even the fiery Mr Ramsay was left open-mouthed by the chaotic goings-on at the bistro - which included a young waitress being fired for asking a question, and Mrs Bouzaglo threatening to call the police on a customer who tried to leave after waiting a long time for his pizza. When Mr Ramsay tried to give the husband and wife team some pointers as to where they were going wrong, he was met with open aggression from Mr Bouzaglo and complete denial about the quality of the food from Mrs Bouzaglo.

"A football mascot has lost his job after nearly two decades  - because he became 'too thin' after losing weight to combat type 2 diabetes. Lenny Berry, 59, has dressed up in character for Bradford City FC since 1994. But after he shed seven stone bosses told him his figure ‘no longer matched the original concept’ of the mascot 'City Gent'. The character - based on a former chairman - is rotund, teams a club strip with a bowler hat and briefcase, interacts with fans at matches and appears at charity functions. Weight off his mind: Lenny Berry lost his job as Bradford's mascot because he was not fat enough . But Mr Berry has now finished his duties after he was diagnosed with diabetes and dropped to ten stone. Mr Berry has dressed up in character for Bradford City FC since 1994 but when he lost weight, club bosses told him he 'no longer matched the original concept' of the mascot 'City Gent' The club offered him a 'Sumo-style' suit to get round the problem, but the life-long Bradford City fan refused. Mr Berry, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, said: ‘I'm absolutely gutted. I am a grown man and this is something I have cried over. I used to have supporters chant things at me, like “who ate all the pies?” ‘I used to get them going and then grab my belly. I play the part of the mascot though, through my face and my eyes. I've always had a good rapport with fans. ‘I've been through the Bradford City fire. I've been through everything down there. I don't want the club getting hurt, I love the club. If you cut me open I'd be claret and amber. ‘It's not the team and it's not the club, but I am disappointed with the way it's been dealt with. ‘Over the years I've done a lot of fundraising. I've taken part in mascot races and other events. ‘I will still be at Bradford City as a season-ticket holder, but it is really sad.’ Mr Berry has been a Bantams' fan since the age of seven and started working at the club selling cushions aged 14. In 1994 he took over as the mascot City . Gent, a large character modelled on former club chairman - the late . Stafford Heginbotham. However, the textiles worker said he received a letter from the club about his future in the role in mid-July. Glory days: Berry in happier times when performing his mascot duties . Happy fan: Berry at last season's Capital One Cup final . He said: ‘In a meeting I asked why it wasn't brought up six years ago when I first lost the weight. They said they knew about my health issues. ‘Obviously I've lost a lot of weight. I . used to be 17 and a half stone, whereas I'm now around ten and a half. I . lost it in about 18 months after I found out I had diabetes.’ Club director Roger Owens said the . issue of club mascots had been discussed during a board meeting and it . had agreed ‘action needed to be taken’. He . said: ‘In the case of The City Gent, the main issue was his physical . appearance, which was much changed from the original concept of the . then-chairman, the late Stafford Heginbotham, who styled the City Gent . on himself. Having a belly-full: Berry, right, with Paul Gascoigne in 1997 . Director Roger Owens said: 'The main issue was his physical appearance, which was much changed from the original concept of the then-chairman, Stafford Heginbotham.' Image shows Mr Berry before he lost weight . ‘We agreed that action needed to be taken. It was also agreed that Lenny be formally contacted, by letter, to put our various points to him and to suggest that the club obtain a Sumo-type suit with character head piece to represent the Gent. ‘The Football League had told us at the . time of the League Two Play-Off final that only animal or human mascots . were now appropriate if they wore an anonymous headset. Ditched: Bradford have axed Berry and will make do with just one mascot - Billy Bantam . ‘Lenny was given a deadline to respond, which was extended and then not complied with by our meeting on Friday. ‘Lenny advised me that he would cease his role as City Gent with immediate effect. ‘The board has now decided that as we are adequately covered by Billy Bantam and that the City Gent name lives on in the excellent club fanzine, we will not replace The City Gent as a mascot.’ Mr Owen added: 'I had also explained to Lenny that he would cease to be part of the mascots match-day ground tour because of the size of his suit and as such he would cease to be paid and have his taxation affairs dealt with by the club. 'Lenny asked about the continuation of his appearance at charity events and he was told that these would cease as the club had not been given a full fix on his activities and we cannot have possible conflict. 'At that point Lenny advised me that he would cease his role as City Gent with immediate effect.'","Lenny Berry, 59, has been the mascot 'City Gent' since 1994 .

"Outspoken: The presenter criticised women who delay having children and then turn to IVF as a 'lifestyle choice', saying it's not designed for families because they 'thought 30 was the new 20' She caused outrage when she suggested girls should forgo university for babies. And it appears Kirstie Allsopp has not quite finished fanning the flames of controversy when it comes to fertility and motherhood. Yesterday the outspoken TV presenter criticised women who delay having children and then turn to IVF as a ‘lifestyle choice’. The Location, Location, Location star made her comments in a new interview with Good Housekeeping in which she was asked about women over 35 wanting to start families. She said: ‘I didn’t meet the right person until I was 32. I know that lots of people don’t meet the right person and lots of women are panicked and unhappy and sad about this. It’s not that I don’t understand that everyone comes to different things at different stages in life. But IVF is not a lifestyle choice. It’s a wonderful medical innovation which helps couples suffering from infertility, but it’s not designed to be done because you and your husband thought 30 was the new 20.’ The 43-year-old – who gave birth to her two sons at 35 and 37 – and has been in a relationship with property developer Ben Andersen for ten years, said she would urge her children to settle down and commit to producing offspring in their 20s rather than face having to pursue IVF. She said: ‘“I would say ‘Darling you’re 27, your girlfriend is 27. You’ve just bought your first flat. Would you like me to help with the childcare?’Not all grandmothers are in that position, I realise that. But I want men to know that if you are in a committed relationship with someone at 30, saying I don’t want kids until we are 35 is not a loving thing to do. She is going to run the risk of having to pump drugs [from IVF] into her body.” Miss Allsopp first raised the issue earlier this year in June when she urged young women to focus on finding a man and having a family before their fertility ‘falls off a cliff’ at 35. She said at the time that it was time to speak ‘frankly’ about the matter, adding: ‘‘At the moment, women have 15 years to go to university, get their career on track, try and buy a home and have a baby. ‘That is a hell of a lot to ask someone. As a passionate feminist, I feel we have not been honest enough with women about this issue. ‘We have to readjust. Don’t go to university because it’s an “experience”. No, it’s where you’re supposed to learn something! Do it when you’re 50!’ The 43-year-old – who gave birth to her two sons at 35 and 37 –  said she would urge her children to settle down and commit to producing offspring in their 20s rather than face having to pursue IVF . Her comments attracted howls of outrage and saw her views branded antiquated - but Miss Allsopp remains unrepentant. In her latest interview, this time with Good Housekeeping magazine (subs, please keep credit) she is the first to admit she is no stranger to generating headlines. Miss Allsopp, who is backing a Snowflake Appeal for family charity Home-Start said: ‘The problem is I’m my own worst enemy! If I wasn’t posh, didn’t wear skirts all the time, didn’t do all this homemaking stuff on the telly, then it would be OK for me to say these things. But if I wasn’t all of those things, then no one would be listening. So the controversy is in the perceived contradiction.’ Miss Allsopp and her sisters Sofie and Natasha share an increased risk of developing breast cancer – a disease their mother Lady Fiona Hindlip battled with for more than 25 years before passing away earlier this year. In November 2010, Sofie, underwent a preventative double mastectomy to remove both her breasts, followed by reconstructive surgery, in order to reduce her cancer risk by 90 per cent. In contrast Kirstie, 41, has adopted a wait-and-see approach, preferring for now to go for regular breast scans and adopt a healthy lifestyle. But Miss Allsopp admitted she is worried by her decision. She said: ‘I’m going to feel bloody stupid if I do get breast cancer and I haven’t had that operation. But at the same time, one of the most important things about it is your personal fears. I am more of a worrier about other things, like should we [as a family] go in the car together or in different cars? Very idiotic and irrational, statistically. What I always worried about was the surgery, and I worry about the worrying of the surgery.” Read the full Kirstie Allsopp interview in the November issue of Good Housekeeping, on sale Friday 3 October.

"At a cost of $350million, it aimed to revive Downtown Las Vegas and 'bring happiness to everyone'. But today, the technology-oriented Downtown Project's success bubble has burst. In the past few weeks, founder and Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh has stepped down, while 30 of the project's 300 employees have been laid off. At the same time, the suicides of three prominent entrepreneurs involved in the program have sparked mystery among the community. Scroll down for video . 'Obsessed with happiness': At a cost of $350million, the Downtown Project aimed to revive Downtown Las Vegas and 'bring happiness to everyone'. But today, its success bubble has burst. Above, Fremont Street . Suicides: In January 2013, Jody Sherman (left), 48, founder of Econom, shot himself in a car as his  start-up company headed toward bankruptcy. One year later, Ovik Banerjee (right), 24, also committed suicide . In January 2013, Jody Sherman, the 48-year-old founder of Econom, shot himself in a car as his e-commerce start-up headed toward bankruptcy. One year later, Ovik Banerjee, a 24-year-old Venture for America fellow who moved to Downtown Vegas as part of the project, jumped  from his Town Terrace apartment. His death prompted four other employees at the Downtown Project to quit, according to Recode.net. Meanwhile, in May 2014, Matt Berman,  the 50-year-old founder of Bolt Barber, was found hanged in an apparent suicide at his home. Another death: In May 2014, Matt Berman (pictured), founder of Bolt Barber, was found hanged at his home . Stepping down: In the past few weeks, founder and Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh (pictured) has stepped down from his position at the Downtown Project, while 30 of the project's 300 employees have been laid off . Although the reasons behind the suicides remain unclear, those involved in the project have said that 40-year-old Hsieh's 'obsession with happiness' could be damaging for entrepreneurs. Indeed, in his 2010 book, 'Delivering Happiness', the enigmatic businessman says his proposal to build a startup city was about creating a 'happy', connected and entrepreneurial lifestyle. He writes: 'It wasn’t just about building a business. It was about building a lifestyle that was about delivering happiness to everyone, including ourselves.' His plan saw eager entrepreneurs to move to Las Vegas and start up a company - the project gained more than 300 in total - with little emotional support if their firm began to fail. Popular: Launched in January 2012, with a five-year plan, the Downtown Project aimed to revitalize the blighted area of Las Vegas through 'several hundred investments and initiatives'. Above, Fremont Street . Kimberly Knoll, a therapist in Downtown, told the technology news site: 'The difference here is the focus on happiness - that’s a goal. But if we negate the negative emotions in our lives, it takes us away from happiness and brings around shame. 'The whole idea of Downtown is grand and wonderful and purposeful, but sometimes the way we’re going about it isn’t psychologically healthy.' She added: 'The pressures are the lack of being able to confide with people, having to put on a vest or mask, and having to say everything’s great.' Following the  suicides, Hsieh was reportedly keen to keep them quiet in the community, with entrepreneurs claiming there were few resources made available and no cathartic outpouring. When asked about the deaths, the former leader is said to have snapped: 'Suicides happen anywhere. Look at the stats.' In the case of Mr Banerjee, the employee had been forced to work in a 'confusing' environment without a 'clear'  job, it is reported. At one point, he was even been told to mislead city officials about the nature of the project - an order that went against his principles and 'tore him up', a friend of Mr Banerjee told the site. Before his death, he reportedly emailed Hsieh saying he was concerned about the Downtown Project and its allocation of resources, but received 'dismissive' responses to each concern. According to the LA Times, Nevada's suicide rate is among the nation's highest, with 19.1 deaths per 100,000 residents, compared to a national average of 12 per 100,000. Tragic: Following the suicides, Hsieh was reportedly keen to keep them quiet, with entrepreneurs claiming there was no cathartic outpouring. Above, Matt Berman (left) and Ovik Banerjee's online profile (right) Most of these deaths occur around Las Vegas, where the odds of suicide are said to be around 50 per cent greater than in other U.S. metropolitan areas. Because of this, Downtown Project residents are now planning to set up a dedicated hotline to help people who are thinking of taking their own lives. Jonathan Jenkins,  co-founder of supply chain startup OrderWithMe, has even set up a church in Dowtown Last Vegas to cater for struggling entrepreneurs. 'A lot of the young people who do these startups, they don’t think they can be frank with each other,' he told the news site. High rate: Nevada's suicide rate is among the nation's highest, with 19.1 deaths per 100,000 residents, compared to a national average of 12 per 100,000. Most of these deaths occur around Las Vegas (pictured) Launched in January 2012, with a five-year plan, the Downtown Project aimed to revitalize the blighted area of Las Vegas through 'several hundred investments and initiatives'. In a recent statement about the laying off of employees, Hsieh said: 'We remain focused on the long-term plan and the evolution of the downtown area. 'As such, we have restructured our support team. This change has affected approximately 30 positions, the majority of which were based in our corporate office. 'We continue to directly employ more than 300 people across our various operations in downtown Las Vegas. 'We are optimistic and confident about the future of downtown Las Vegas and the continued growth of our entire portfolio of investments.' He also downplayed his role in the startup city, saying: 'I am the CEO of Zappos.com but I’ve never referred to myself as the CEO of Downtown Project, and I’ve never considered myself as being in “day-to-day management” of Downtown Project. 'My role continues to be as an investor, advisor, and equivalent of a board member that sets high-level general direction and strategy but is not involved in day-to-day management of people or projects.'","Founded in 2012, Downtown Project aimed to 'bring happiness' to Vegas .

"A toddler who had more than 100 blood transfusions and a bone marrow transplant before her first birthday is back at home after an amazing recovery. Ava Maye Riley-Maher, now 14 months, was diagnosed with a rare cancer-like disease – called Langerhan's Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) - aged just five months. Ava had to undergo 15 weeks of aggressive chemotherapy and receive more than 100 blood transfusions in order to keep her body functioning. Ava Maye Riley-Maher, now 14 months, was diagnosed with a rare cancer-like disease - called Langerhan's Cell Histiocytosis - aged just five months . But she failed to respond to the treatment and doctors said a bone marrow transplant would be her best hope of beating the disease. Fortunately, a match was found - and her parents say they now wake up every day thankful that she is still alive. Ava was released from the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital in June, two days before her first birthday, and is recovering at home in Manchester with mother Kirsty Riley, 24. Her father, Jamie Maher, 28, has also been at her side throughout the ordeal. Ava still has to be kept in semi-isolation and has to take more than 20 medicines a day - but her last transfusion was five weeks ago and her mother says she is hopeful her daughter will make a full recovery. LCH affects just one in 250,000 children a year in the UK. Ava had to undergo 15 weeks of aggressive chemotherapy and receive more than 100 blood transfusions in order to keep her body functioning . It is not technically a cancer, but it is cancer-like and can be treated with chemotherapy. LCH is not technically a cancer, but it is cancer-like and can be treated with chemotherapy. LCH . occurs when the body accumulates too many Langerhan's cells - these are . a type of white blood cell that normally help fight infection. In . LCH too many of these cells are produced and they build up in certain . parts of the body where they can form tumours and damage organs. The cause of the disease is unknown. About 50 children in the UK develop LCH every year. Symptoms . include swollen lymph glands, poor appetite, bone pain, a skin rash, . discharge from the ears, breathing difficulties and jaundice. There is an 80 to 90 per cent survival rate. The condition develops from cells in the skin. These cells are normally only found in the skin and airways but in LCH abnormal cells can be found in other parts of the body, including the bone marrow, liver, spleen and pituitary gland. About 50 children in the UK develop LCH every year. Symptoms include swollen lymph glands, poor appetite, bone pain, a skin rash, discharge from the ears, breathing difficulties and jaundice. There is an 80 to 90 per cent survival rate. Ms Riley said: ‘As soon as you hear the word cancer you think “that’s it” and we couldn’t see any light at the end of the tunnel. ‘To see her undergoing all these treatments when she was so small was just heartbreaking, but we had to hope that she would get a donor.’ Ava spent eight weeks on the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow donor register until a match was found. Her parents do not know the donor’s identity other than that she is a 21-year-old woman from the UK, but they can contact her six months after the operation. Ms Riley said: ‘The weeks leading up to the operation were probably the scariest part as we didn’t know whether it would come off or whether anything would go wrong. ‘It was only when I saw the bone marrow delivered to the theatre in a bag that I knew that it was her lifeline. But even then she could have gone either way after the transplant. ‘Looking at her now it’s hard to think about what might have happened. The doctors are amazed at how she’s recovered. ‘We wake up every day and are just thankful she’s here. When she walks out of the school gates with her friends I will remember how lucky we are.’ Ava (pictured with her parents, Kirsty Riley and Jamie Maher) failed to respond to the treatment so had to have a bone marrow transplant. She was released from hospital two days before her first birthday and is now recovering at home .","Ava Maye Riley-Maher was diagnosed with a rare cancer-like condition, called Langerhan's Cell Histiocytosis, when she was just five-months-old .

"The mother of a teenage tennis star who was left with blood streaming down her face after being hit by her father for losing a match has launched an astonishing defence of her husband. Umpires called the police after Ioana Andrada Surdeanu, a 16-year-old Romanian junior player, was injured by her father Lucian, who is also her coach, when she crashed out of a girls' tournament in Israel. Miss Surdeanu, who had reached the quarter final of the International Tennis Federation Tournament, screamed when her father hit her as 'punishment' for losing against the favourite to win the competition, witnesses said. Ioana Andrada Surdeanu (left), a 16-year-old tennis star, was hit in the face by her father (right) after she lost a match . Umpires called the police after Ioana Andrada Surdeanu, a Romanian junior player, was slapped by her father . Amazingly Alina Surdeanu said her husband Lucian had been treated like a 'common criminal' adding that the incident was regrettable but he had never hit the teen before . Both Alina and her husband Lucian complained about his treatment by Israeli investigators. Her daughter Ioana has also defended her father . But instead of defending her daughter, Alina Surdeanu sided with her 47-year-old husband and complained about his treatment by Israeli police investigating the incident. 'It was regrettable that he lost his temper,' she said. 'He has never hit her before, this is the first time. There were arguments before because they're both very temperamental. Using her daughter's middle name she added: 'Andrada wants to succeed very much, and when her game is bad, she gets angry.' Bemoaning Lucian's arrest, she said he had been 'handcuffed on both his hands and ankles and led away like a common criminal in front of everyone.' After being told his daughter had a broken nose she said he 'was worried for her' and had wanted to see his daughter, only to be refused his request by investigators. 'He pleaded guilty,' she said. 'He was in tears over his thoughtless gesture, but despite his clear remorse they did not give in. In fact, the police extended the investigation without any reason. 'He was not allowed to phone.' 'Each day he was moved to a different cell, with other prisoners. He did not even see daylight until a week later.' She added that she had only found out the full story on her husband's return to Romania. As for Ioana, she said her daughter was feeling 'guilty' about the incident and that her husband had sacrificed his military career so he could coach his daughter when she was five-years-old. 'He went with her to tournaments and took care of the financial side,' she said. 'Nobody helps us, the parent's of players are the ones who invest in tennis in Romania.' Alina's views were echoed by her daughter, who said it was normal for him to 'punish' her after matches, usually by taking her phone. The fledgling tennis star said: 'I didn't play well in that match. At the end, he went to confiscate my phone. That's the way he punishes me when it is my fault and I don't win matches. I was annoyed and I threw the phone at him and said ""take it"". 'Of course he didn't catch it, and he got angry because of the way I've behaved. He pushed me and slapped me twice. One of the slaps hit my nose. 'I sat down on my knees, and I put my hands on my face so he would not be able to hit me again. I had a little blood, I was scared and shaking. 'He gave me a wet towel and said that I should go to the tournament's doctor. When I came back, he was already kicked out from the tennis court and they told me he had been sent to the hotel.' 'By the time I got to the hotel, they had already arrested him. The umpires took me to the police station. On our way, we stopped near a police car. It had bars on the back seat and when I looked inside I saw my dad.' Miss Surdeanu, who had reached the quarter final of the International Tennis Federation Tournament, screamed when her father, Lucian, hit her . Miss Surdeanu defended her father, saying she 'deserved' to be punished after her defeat . Mr Surdeanu was given a £237 fine for hitting his daughter and has reportedly returned home . Despite needing treatment from a doctor to stem the blood pouring from her nose, Miss Surdeanu, ranked 249th in the world, tearfully defended her father. 'At the police station they didn't let me see him, like he was dangerous and I had to stay away from him. 'My father is not a beast, he didn't break my nose, I didn't have my face covered in blood. It's true, he slapped me. But so what? I deserved it. 'It was my fault because I've yelled and said some bad words to him. I was irresponsible after all the sacrifices he made for me. I admit that I was scared in that moment he hit me, but I know he regrets what he did and he loves me as much as I love him. 'He maybe exaggerated a little, but he didn't deserve to be arrested. I'm worried for him. I want to continue this journey in tennis with the support of the whole family. 'When I read that he is described as a ""criminal"" and a ""beast"", I feel like I want to scream. I feel guilty for what is happening.' Mr Surdeanu was given a £237 fine and has reportedly returned home to Romania. Showing little remorse for the incident he claimed that his time in an Israeli jail had left him with skin disease and lice. 'For me, Israel no longer exists on the map,' he said, adding that he would never return to the country. Tough: Richard Williams, father of Serena and Venus, brought them up in Compton, California, to give them a 'fighter's mentality' 1) Richard Williams, father of Serena and Venus, admitted that he brought up his daughters in the notorious neighbourhood of Compton, California, to give them 'a fighter's mentality'. He took them to the courts when they were just four years old, later realising that he should have waited until they were at least six. He says the motto he drilled into them from an early age was:  ‘You got to be rough, you’ve got to be tough and you’ve got to be strong.' 2) John Tomic, the father and coach of Bernard Tomic, headbutted his son's hitting partner, breaking the player's nose after a row on a training court in Madrid. Despite this, he said: 'I don't feel guilty, I didn't do anything wrong.' 3) Damir Dokic, father of Jelena Dokic, bizarrely threatened to assassinate the Australian ambassador to Serbia and was ejected from Wimbledon in 2000 for breaking a journalist's camera. The father of the tennis star also hit the headlines after saying he would kill himself if his daughter was a lesbian. 4) Jim Pierce, father of retired player Mary Pierce, shouted at her daughter to 'kill the b****' during a tournament. In 1993, Ms Pierce obtained a restraining order from her father, who had verbally abused her. His outbursts were so bad that he was eventually banned from Women's Tennis Association matches. 5) Croatian player Mirjana Lucic said she left her home with her mother and four siblings to escape her abusive father Marinko. He told the Telegraph: 'I never used excessive force, and if I did give her the occasional slap, it was because of her behaviour; I did what I believed what was best for the child.'

The photo was posted by an outraged passerby onto Reddit, with the caption 'scumbag local church puts this up in time for Mental Health Week'. Posters on the site quickly jumped to criticise the message. One user wrote, 'Seriously? They are going to get a lot of complaints for that one... It is not ok to make those sorts of comments about mental illness. I know many religious people who wouldn't go back if their churches did something similar!' Another Reddit member wrote, 'It's odd, I read the words, but all I got was..."" I'm too delusional to be compassionate"" . I'll just go with that, I think.' Reverend Ross Mackay defended the church's actions, and said that the billboard message had been put up long before the start of Mental Health Week. 'It's a comment on us, not other people,' the Reverend said. 'We have people within our congregation who have mental health issues and we take them very seriously. We are very supportive of anyone who comes to church who may suffer from these issues and have initiatives in place to aid them.' Many Reddit users echoed the sentiments of the Reverend, pointing out that while the sign may have offended some, it was probably posted with the best of intentions. 'I think their intention is: ""It's mental health week. We aren't depressed and we attribute that to our faith with god. Maybe by stating this we can encourage people to join the church help them not be depressed"",' wrote one user. Another Reddit member 'I'm guessing they just didn't think it through and unintentionally sent across the wrong message. If I remember correctly they [Yeronga Uniting Church] are usually pretty keen to answer any questions.' Yeronga Uniting Church, in Brisbane, Queensland, posted the message 'Too blessed to be depressed' on their billboard, coinciding with the nationwide Mental Health Awareness Week. Reverend Mackay said that the church was actively involved in the local community, and ran a 'men's shed' for men who struggled with loneliness, self worth and loss of personal value. 'We are a community oriented church trying to work within that community, and sometimes it won't understand our meaning when we post messages,' he said. 'No matter what we put up, someone will take it the wrong way.' One Reddit user tried to explain the possible intention behind the message. 'As someone with a mental illness, I think they mean that if we work hard to research mental illness or understand it better through prayer or whatever, it won't be a problem anymore,' they said. Another commentator pointed out that in light of Mental Health Week it was important to remember that depression cut across all denominations and beliefs. 'Let us not forget that many Christians do struggle with long term depression...for many [it] takes a very long time to feel comforted and many of those find no comfort at all despite being fully committed Christians.' One user attempted to make light of the situation, posting that 'There's only one thing rong with your post. It's Yeronga.' The Black Dog Institute research revealed that depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and that while 45% of Australians will experience mental health issues at some point in their life, every year 20% of Australians will suffer from mental illness including depression and anxiety.

"Juventus' march to a fourth successive title was halted on Friday as it was held to a goalless draw at fierce rival Fiorentina in Serie A. Massimiliano Allegri's side moved four points clear but second-place Roma can cut the advantage to a solitary point if it beats Sassuolo on Saturday. Juventus appeared to have half an eye on Tuesday's crucial Champions League match against Atletico Madrid and Allegri rested a number of players, including star striker Carlos Tevez, who was brought on after an hour.

It was a grudge match for both sides as Fiorentina had come from two goals down to win the corresponding fixture 4-2 last season, but Juventus got its revenge by knocking the Tuscan club out of the Europa League. It was a tetchy first half with four bookings and several penalty appeals turned down. Patrice Evra had the first real opportunity of the match shortly after halftime as he was set up by French compatriot Paul Pogba and his effort stung Neto's gloves. Fiorentina went close in the 67th when Pogba gave the ball away to Mati Fernandez who sent Mario Gomez clear, but Leonardo Bonucci pulled off a perfectly-time last-ditch tackle. From the resulting corner the ball came out to Juan Cuadrado, whose screamer was punched away by Gianluigi Buffon. Juventus had another penalty appeal turned down in stoppage time when Pogba's flick struck David Pizarro on the hand from point-blank range.

"A pregnant woman sticking up for two others mothers on a Brisbane bus has been the victim of an appalling verbal attack herself from another passenger. Nine News reported it all started on a bus in the Caboolture area, north of Brisbane, when one woman wasn't very happy after she had to change seats for two mothers with prams.

"A six-bedroom mansion in one of the most desirable postcodes in London has gone on the market for £75million - but any buyer will need another £25million to renovate it before they can move in. Number 2 Carlton House Terrace is just a few minutes stroll from Buckingham Palace and overlooks The Mall and St James's Park. Built in 1829, it has hosted Kings and Queens and has been called home by aristocrats, powerful American business leaders and even Sir James Horlick, of malted drink fame. Exceedingly desirable residence: No2 Carlton House Terrace, a short stroll from Buckingham Palace, is on the market for £75million . Lick of paint: The interior will need an extensive revamp, estimated to cost in the region of £25m . Plush: This staircase is one of the few remaining original features. It was heavily damaged by bombing in the Second World War . It was designed by John Nash, the architect responsible for much of the layout of Regency London under the patronage of the Prince Regent and the man behind the Royal Pavilion, Brighton, as well as Buckingham Palace itself. Other previous residents of the terrace include prime Ministers Palmerston and Gladstone, as well as Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India. A less salubrious resident was Joachim von Ribbentrop, the former Ambassador from Nazi Germany. In the 20th century the Terrace came under threat of partial or complete demolition and redevelopment because there was little demand for large houses in the centre of the capital. Many of the properties were leased to exclusive clubs. Surprisingly, considering its location, the property lay empty for for twenty years after it was severely damaged by bombing in 1940. Famous guests at the property have included King George V and Queen Mary . Elaborate: Detailed period stonework on the side of the building. Former resident: The Duke of Roxburghe (left), calling at Buckingham Palace after the death of King Edward VII. He lived in the property in the 1920s and 1930s. Right, The Duke of York's Column in the 19th century. The house can be seen to the left . There has already been interest in the property from the global super-rich . Currently, the 23,135 sq ft property is currently the home of the Royal College of Pathologists, but they have now outgrown the building and so the Crown Estate is looking to sell via estate agents Savills, reports The Times. One of the appealing aspects of the property is the buyer can enjoy the beautiful period facade but choose either a modern or more sympathetic interior when renovating. Interest from overseas buyers is said to be high, especially because of the property's proximity to Buckingham Palace. The architect behind the planning application has proposed large reception rooms, a library, a swimming pool, a cinema room, and a roof terrace with views across the city. The construction of Carlton House Terrace was begun by John Nash in 1829. It consisted of two terraces, both facing St James’s Park. Number 2 was the first house to be completed. The terraces were designed in a neoclassical style, stucco clad, with Corinthian columned facades, surmounted by an elaborate frieze and pediment. The houses were unusual among expensive London terraces in having no mews to the rear. This was because Nash wanted the houses to make the best possible use of the view of the park. From its inception, the scale and location of Carlton House Terrace made it an ideal townhouse for the aristocracy. Former residents have included The Marquess of Clanricarde, George Savile Foljambe and his wife Viscountess Milton, Madlwin Drummond, the widow of American business leader Marshall Field, New York millionaire Otto Khan, the Duke and Duchess of Roxburghe and Sir James Horlick. In 1940 it was hit by a bomb and lay empty for 20 years. In 1967 it was acquired by the Royal College of Pathologists.","Carlton Terrace property has housed aristocrats and captains of industry .

"Many people say the first thing they'd do if they won the lottery would be to buy their own private island and move away from the rest of humanity. Now house-hunters have the chance to do just that, after an Orkney isle off the north coast of Scotland went up for sale for £600,000. The island of Hunda, which lies about 25 miles north east of the mainland port of Thurso, has no habitable property. The uninhabited Orkney isle of Hunda, which is connected to the neighbouring island of Burray by a causeway, has gone up for sale for £600,000 . Although there are no habitable buildings on the island, potential buyers get a six-bedroom farmhouse on the neighbouring isle of Burray . But its six-figure sale price does include a five-bedroom farmhouse on the neighbouring island of Burray, which is connected to Hunda via a causeway. Plans have also been lodged to build a house on the isle, although, with no mains connection, electricity would have to be generated by building a wind turbine or bringing in a generator. The asking price also includes a plot of land on Burray, a workshop, two livestock sheds, sheep handling pens and a variety of derelict cottages that could be transformed into homes. Hunda and the farmhouse is currently owned by farmer George Rouse, who inherited it from his father George senior. He is now selling it so he and his wife can retire. Mr Rouse, 71, said: 'I inherited the property from my father who was posted to Orkney with the army after the Second World War. 'He came up here in the late 1950s. After he worked here he was posted to Indonesia in 1957 and in that time he started looking for land up here in Orkney, and our local bank purchased the land on behalf of my father.' The current owner, farmer George Rouse, says the island offers fantastic views of the surrounding coastline and marine wildlife such as whales and seals . The island comes with a plot of land on neighbouring Burray, a workshop, two livestock sheds, sheep handling pens and a variety of derelict cottages . He added: 'Until that point, we had been living on a house boat. I was 13 at the time so living in a house was quite a change but the area is beautiful and I soon got used to it. After Indonesia he started farming and that's how I got into it. 'I inherited it when my father passed away and I have enjoyed living here but my wife and I are looking for a change of scenery and we need to capitalise our pension. There's a strong sense of community here and you get to know everybody. 'There's a small school with just seven pupils and it's a fantastic place for children, it's a safe area and a great place to live. 'We get a lot of marine mammals like seals and occasionally some whales, but there are no foxes, badgers, snakes, or anything like that. It would be perfect for someone who lives in a big city like London and is looking for a change.' A spokesman from estate agent Savills, who are handling the sale, said: 'Orkney has long been regarded as a very desirable place to live on account of the quality of life the islands offer and the strong sense of community. 'Hunda lies on the south western shores of Burray, in a beautiful and unspoilt corner of the island, at the end of a public road. 'This sale presents an unusual opportunity to acquire a coastal farm which includes its own private island linked by a causeway.'

"After 65 years of marriage, one Brazilian couple's bond was so strong they stayed together even in death.

The pair had 10 children and 14 grandchildren, who remembered the couple as a legendary romance . Meanwhile, Diva was receiving chemotherapy for a tumor, Express UK reports. Diva reportedly asked family to gather at the hospital sometime last week as her condition worsened. 'She felt that her time was coming and asked to see her relatives,' grandson Rafael Max told reporters. 'My grandfather went to [her room in the] hospital too. They had a private conversation together and after that they both seemed at peace with everything.'

"Two toddlers have been injured - one critically - after a bouncy house they were in was lifted by a gust of wind and blown 60 feet before crashing to the ground. The two boys, aged two and three, had climbed into the inflatable structure at Sullivan Farm in Nashua, New Hampshire on Sunday. The farm's owner has since said it was not open at the time. The house went airborne, flew over a fence and then crashed to the ground, leaving the two-year-old child with critical injuries and the older boy with less serious injuries. 'We see the bouncy house come up off the ground and slam right back down to the place that it was and then it takes off about 60 to 70 feet in the air,' one of the victims' fathers told WMUR. Scroll down for video . Danger: Two boys climbed inside this bouncy house at a New Hampshire farm on Sunday even though the structure was closed. It was then swept away by a gust of wind and they were thrown to the ground . Landing: The bouncy house can be seen between trees, where it landed after flying 60 feet in the air . 'It travels maybe about 100-150 feet away and slams both of our children down into the ground.' Fire officials said they believe the structure actually traveled between 50 and 60 feet but do not know how high it went. Photographs taken after the incident show the deflated house where it came to a stop between trees along a muddy path at the farm. When the bouncy house landed, the two boys were trapped inside, but their parents managed to pull them out. The younger boy was flown to a Boston hospital for treatment, while the three-year-old was taken to a local hospital, where he is expected to recover. Staff said the older boy was up and talking. The farm's co-owner, Gary Bergeron, told WMUR that the bouncy house had been inflated so it could dry off after last week's rain and was not open at the time. Confusion: Farm co-owner Gary Bergeron told WMUR that the bouncy house was drying out and had been blocked by hay bales and was not supposed to be used. The families thought it was open . Investigation: Staff at Sullivan Farm, pictured, said the bouncy house was closed and no one gave them permission to enter it, but one of the boys' fathers said a staff member indicated that it was open . He said that after moving it, the bouncy house was blocked off with a couple of hay bales. Rides require tickets but there were no tickets being sold for the inflatable, he added. A spokesperson for the farm said that they were not given permission to enter it. But the father of one of the injured boys says a farm volunteer led visitors to believe it was open. Another farm visitor, Ron Perry, said: 'There was no sign saying it was closed.... There was no indication that it was closed. I asked how much was it and he said it was free. Bergerson added: 'This is so unfortunate. 'It wasn't meant to be used. I just hope the kids are OK.' The incident is being investigated by Nashua Police and Fire and the State Fire Marshal's Office.

"With £3,500, a family of four could spend a fortnight relaxing in Disney World Florida or perhaps a week being pampered at a five-star hotel on the Costa del Sol. But, if they would rather stick close to home – and can find ten friends to bring along – they could fork out the princely sum for a week in Meadowgate – Kirstie Allsopp’s renovated Devon bolthole. One of the country’s most famous homemakers, known for her love of traditional arts and crafts, Miss Allsopp, 42, has opened the doors to the home she made famous in the show Kirstie’s Homemade Home. Kirstie Allsopp's Devon holiday home, Meadowgate, which holidaymakers can now rent out for £3,500 per week through the firm Classic Cottages . The dining room of Kirstie Allsopp's Meadowgate home in Devon, which featured on the show 'Kirstie's Homemade Home. The TV presenter spent £150,000 transforming the home after it lay empty for 39 years . The property's kitchen comes complete with a huge table for dining as well as an Aga oven. Miss Allsopp bought the mansion for £300,000 in 2008 . In Kirstie's Homemade Home, the presenter spent £150,000 bringing new life to the property, using reclaimed and recycled furniture throughout the house, including in the sitting room, pictured, wherever possible . Her current programme, Kirstie's Fill Your House For Free, advocates the idea of reusing and repurposing items and, true to her word, it seems to be an ethos she has kept alive throughout Meadowgate . With its warm wooden floors and ‘cosy’ cluttered rooms, the house embodies the outspoken presenter’s DIY ethos. With the money from her successful TV career, some people might have suspected that away from the camera Miss Allsopp’s upcycling credentials would fall away – not so at Meadowgate. From the seemingly homemade spreads strewn around the house, to the gold and black wallpaper – designed by the Location, Location, Location star herself – in the downstairs bathroom, her taste on and off screen appears to remain the same. Perched in Welcombe’s rugged landscape, classed as an area of outstanding beauty, the house – complete with games room and annexe – is just a short stroll from the National Trust beach of Welcombe Mouth and only a mile from the nearest pub – although it’s a five mile trek to the shop. The six-bedroom property – it can sleep up to 14 – fetches £3,402-a-week during the peak summer holiday period but can go for as little as £1,875 in less busy months. It has previously only been available for longer summer lets but is now available for shorter periods though Classic Cottages. Finished off with quirky touches – see the rowing boat in the middle of the garden, a bath in the master bedroom and gold WOW lettering on a wall – the transformation from wreck to dream family home was chronicled in the 2009 TV show. The mansion has six bedrooms, including this master bedroom and sleeps up to 14 people. The TV presenter often stays at the Devon home with her family . Visitors to Meadowgate can enjoy Sky television and parking for four cars but while dogs are welcome, smokers are not . The mansion has views such as this from the twin bedroom of the rugged landscape and is just a short stroll from the National Trust beach of Welcombe . Before Miss Allsopp bought Meadowgate in 2008, for £300,000, it had been empty for 39 years and was in a shocking state of disrepair. Now, however, she often stays there with her partner, developer Ben Andresen, 55, their sons Bay, 8, and Oscar, 6 and Mr Andersen’s two sons from a previous marriage, Hal, 14, and Orion, 11. In Kirstie’s Homemade Home, the presenter spent £150,000 bringing new life to the property, using reclaimed and recycled furniture and fittings wherever possible. Her current programme, Kirstie’s Fill Your House For Free, advocates the idea of reusing and repurposing items and, true to her word, it seems to be an ethos she has kept alive throughout Meadowgate, with its mismatched crockery and thrown-together feel. Visitors can enjoy Sky television and parking for four cars but while dogs are welcome, smokers are not. The price includes electricity, heating and one basket of logs for the fire but any basket after that comes at an extra cost. Some preliminary reservations to let the home, which also features a special room for children, have been made up to two years in advance . Mary Harlow, operations manager for Classic Cottages who let the property describes it as perfect for a family holiday as it is right by the beach. But if the weather isn't great, holidaymakers could always use the property's games room, pictured . Mary Harlow, operations manager for Classic Cottages, said the company have had the home on their books for five years, taking it on shortly after Miss Allsopp bought it. She said there has been ‘good but static’ interest from renters throughout that period, with some preliminary reservations coming in as far as two years in advance. Miss Harlow believes the celebrity factor has some part to play I this success, saying: ‘I think obviously the fact that it’s [Miss Allsopp’s] has some attraction but it’s also a big family home and right by the beach, so perfect for a family holiday’.","For £3,500 a week, holidaymakers can rent out Kirstie Allsopp's holiday home in Devon, which sleeps up to 14 people .

"David Cameron has launched an extraordinary attack on rebel MP Mark Reckless for defecting to UKIP, accusing him of betraying activists who worked to get his ‘fat arse’ on the Commons benches. The Prime Minister is furious at the Rochester MP’s decision to leave the Tory party, and has used speeches at the Tory party conference to vow to personally lead the fight to defeat him in the forthcoming by-election. And he insisted he cared 1,000 times more about Scotland remaining in the UK than he did about whether Britain left the European Union, insisting he only wanted to act in the national interest. Prime Minister David Cameron has branded UKIP defector Mark Reckless a 'fat arse' who has betrayed the hard work of Tory activists . Mr Reckless, pictured with Nigel Farage, announced on Saturday that he was joining UKIP, but admits he could lose the by-election in Rochester and Strood . The Tory party conference has been rocked by the defections of Mr Reckless and Douglas Carswell to UKIP. The moves have threatened to overshadow the Conservative leadership’s planned focus on the economy. While Mr Cameron is resigned to the fact that Mr Carswell, a long-standing Eurosceptic MP, will win the by-election in Clacton, he is furious at Mr Reckless’ ‘betrayal’. Speaking at several parties and receptions held around the conference in Birmingham, Mr Cameron has become increasingly animated about the way Mr Reckless relied on the support of Conservative activists to get elected. The Prime Minister argues that committed volunteers have ‘knocked on doors, stuffed envelopes, licked stamps to get his fat arse on the Commons benches, and this is how he repays them’. At another event Mr Cameron is said to have claimed that if Mr Reckless 'got off his fat arse and worked harder he wouldn't have to defect to UKIP to save his skin'. The Tory party is expected to mount a huge effort to hold the seat, with local activists lining up to criticise Mr Reckless’ decision to change parties. Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate a new deal with the EU, clawing back powers from Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum in 2017. Under pressure from Eurosceptics, Mr Cameron has made clear he will not argue for Britain to remain in the EU if it is not in the national interest. London Mayor Boris Johnson last night launched an extraordinary attack on Tories who have defected to UKIP, claiming they were the sort of people who injure themselves having sex with vacuum cleaners . In an interview this morning, the Prime Minister made clear he holds no love for the EU institution. During the campaign on Scottish independence, Mr Cameron said he would be ‘heartbroken’ if the UK had been broken up. Today he revealed: ‘I feel about a thousand times more strongly about our United Kingdom than I do about the European Union. ‘If I didn’t think it was in Britain’s interest to be in the EU, I wouldn’t argue for it. I think the best answer for Britain is a reformed position in the EU because we’re a trading nation, we don’t just want access to those markets, we want a say over the rules. But let’s be frank, it’s not working properly for us at the moment. ‘The single currency has driven process of change that has alienated in people in Europe.’ In an apparent admission of the scale of the challenge, Mr Reckless yesterday confessed that he could lose his seat and become 'a footnote in history'. He has faced an onslaught of criticism from his former Conservative party colleagues since his defection, with some openly accusing him of lying about his plans to defect. Today it emerged a former deputy to London Mayor Boris Johnson has also defected to UKIP. Richard Barnes told the Standard that the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems did not “speak the language of normal people”. Douglas Carswell became the first Conservative to defect to UKIP last month, sparking speculation that up to eight MPs were considering leaving the party . Mr Johnson last night launched an extraordinary attack on Tories who have defected to UKIP, claiming they were the sort of people who injure themselves having sex with vacuum cleaners. Mr Johnson vowed to take on the 'quitters, the splitters, the kippers' who are trying to undermine the Tory party. And he mocked defectors with an extraordinary sex joke. He told delighted Tory activists:'The EU commission wants to ban vacuum cleaners on the grounds that they are too powerful. ‘If you do not handle your vacuum cleaner correctly, you may end up inhaling the hamster – the budgerigar through the bars of the cage. ‘And I have read that there are some people – probably the type who are thinking of defecting to UKIP – who present themselves at A&E with barely credible injuries sustained through vacuum cleaner abuse.’ He suggested that UKIP leader Nigel Farage should switch to become a Conservative. Mr Cameron today also urged Tories not to follow the defectors. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: ‘The point is there's no need for anyone to defect, because if you want an in-out referendum on Europe, if you want action on immigration, if you want further reform of our welfare system, if you want to keep our economy growing, the only way to get that is to have a Conservative government. ‘If you vote for UKIP, you’re more than likely to end up with Ed Miliband No 10 Downing Street and Ed Balls in the Treasury, repeating all the mistakes they made in the past and not giving you a choice over Europe. ‘So it’s a very straight choice at the next election, and I think the feeling at this conference is of a team coming together rot serve our country and put forward a very clear long-term economic plan f or how we can deliver in that country in the years ahead.’","Prime Minister vows to lead fight to defeat UKIP in by-election battle .

"It was more subdued than the celebrations which used to follow his goal-scoring. But yesterday Paul Gascoigne managed a thumbs-up after spending the Bank Holiday weekend in hospital.

He was barely recognisable on Thursday when he was seen wandering the streets clutching a bottle of gin and cans of beer. It . is thought he had been on a three-week binge at his rented apartment in . the exclusive Sandbanks, Dorset, in the latest chapter of his long . battle with alcoholism. Friends told The Sun how he had been drinking for three weeks in his house, which they said stank of urine and vomit. One . said: 'He'd been drinking for about three weeks', while another added . 'I saw him drinking neat gin straight from the bottle in his bed. He was . off his face, a proper mess.'

The ex-footballer was taken to hospital on Thursday 'for his own . safety' after being found drinking on the street . The . ex-England midfielder has been plagued by alcohol and drug problems and . was spotted last Thursday with his head in his hands following a suspected drinking . binge in Sandbanks, Dorset, last week . Shortly before the ambulance had whisked him away, at 3pm, the former England star was seen calling a friend to plead: ‘I’m in trouble, please can you come and help me?’ He had been observed drinking in public on several occasions in preceding days, and at lunchtime on Tuesday was videoed by a passer-by in what appeared to be an inebriated state, in central Bournemouth. Meanwhile, Gascoigne was also facing homelessness after being told he must quit his £3million penthouse apartment. A string of 'noise complaints' by neighbours was thought to have been what led to the ultimatum. The director of the management company in charge of the flats dismissed claims he was being forced to leave, but said his landlord was not renewing the rental contract. Gazza pictured in the stands of a football match between Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspurs . Christopher Eales, 84, said: 'The only thing I can tell you is that he has not been asked to leave. 'His lease will run out on September 13 and the landlord will not be renewing the contract as he wants the flat back.' It had been claimed that Gascoigne was set to make his return to football after a journey for cigarettes led him to meet taxi driver and Abbey FC manager Chris Foster - who convinced the former England international to sign for the Hayward Sunday League side. The 47-year-old enjoyed a memorable professional career which saw him play for the likes of Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio and Rangers, whilst also becoming a firm favourite among many England supporters. Gascoigne, who has been plagued by alcoholism and drug addiction, last played professional football ten years ago when he made four appearances for then-League Two side Boston United.

Chris Waddle, who played in the 1990 World Cup where Gascoigne made his name, took to Twitter to offer his support. He tweeted: 'I know it's hard to stay focused but you have so many people who want you to come through this come on stay strong' Above a picture of the pair playing together for England, he then added: 'Love you mate'. Another of Gascoigne's Italia '90 teammates, Match of the Day Presenter Gary Lineker, also offered a serious message for the troubled star. In comments reported in the Daily Record, he said: 'Ultimately the support has got to come from Gazza himself. 'We've supported him over years, Tottenham and his friends. I wish him well but ultimately it's got to come from Paul.'","Paul Gascoigne, 47, looked healthier as he returned to his home .

"If you want to know the secret to staying happily married for 80 years, don’t ask Maurice Kaye – just go straight to his wife, Helen. Because apparently, 102-year-old Mr Kaye will simply agree with whatever she says anyway. And that, he believes, is the key to their success. Scroll down for video . Maurice Kaye, left, met his wife Helen, right, when he would visit the London shop where she worked in 1929 . Mr Kaye was a travelling salesman just aged 17 in Walworth, South London when he first met 16-year-old Helen . ‘The most useful thing is that as long as I agree with her, then I’m safe,’ said Mr Kaye, before joking: ‘I didn’t think it would last a week but it’s amazing it’s lasted 80 years.’ Mrs Kaye, 101, sees things a little differently, however, insisting: ‘We are very tolerant of each other and we do love each other. ‘You mustn’t be hard on each other. And if you have to give in a little bit, you give in a little bit.’ Yesterday the Kayes marked their oak wedding anniversary, making them one of Britain’s longest-married couples. The couple  married in 1934 before they moved to Bournemouth after the war because their house and business  was destroyed by bombing . Over the decades they have endured more than their fair share of tragedy – losing two of their children and having their home bombed in the war. But despite the difficult times, Mrs Kaye said it is their ability to laugh together that has helped them reach the landmark. She said: ‘It’s been a wonderful marriage. It’s been hard work and not without tragedy but we’ve had so many good moments together. ‘It works because we just have the same sense of humour – we just laugh at the same things.’ It all began in 1929 when Mrs Kaye was 16 and working in her family’s womenswear shop in Walworth, South London. Mr Kaye, 17, a travelling salesman, paid a visit and ended up staying for three hours, prompting his future mother-in-law to ask: ‘Who’s going to throw him out, you or me?’ Meanwhile, Mr Kaye had caught his future wife’s attention because he had a car. ‘In those days not very many people had cars, which made him interesting,’ she confessed. Five years later, they were married, having waited for Mrs Kaye’s older sister Paula to wed first. Mr Kaye went on to manage his father’s factory and two shops in London before he joined the Army in 1939, leaving Mrs Kaye to run the business. Then, just before D-Day in 1944, the factory, shops and their home were destroyed in a bombing raid. Neither was at home at the time but they soon fled to Bournemouth, where they have lived ever since after re-establishing their clothing business in the town. The couple faced more heartbreak when their son Anthony died of a burst appendix aged four. And they lost a daughter, Lesley, to a brain tumour in 1991 when she was in her 30s. The couple, now aged 101 and 102 continue to live in their own home with a live-in carer . Today their surviving children Larry and Tina visit them in their flat regularly, and so do their seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Although they have a live-in carer, they keep sharp by playing bridge. Larry, 66, said he thought the secret to his parents’ longevity was setting targets. ‘They wanted to see their grandchildren, and now they want to see their great-grandchildren grow up,’ he said. The record for Britain’s longest-married couple is thought to be held by Karam and Katari Chand from Bradford, who wed in 1925. Two of the couple's four children have died although their remaining son and daughter, Larry and Tina are regular visitors along with their seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren .

"Carla Maclean, 19, said she fears she will 'drop dead' after being diagnosed with a hole in her heart three years ago . A teenager who has a hole in her heart . says she has been refused an operation to fix it on the Health Service – . unless she has a heart attack. Carla Maclean, 19, has faced an agonising wait for surgery since being diagnosed with the condition three years ago. Despite . the procedure being routinely available for children and the elderly, . she has been told she must fund the £16,000 operation herself, unless . she has a heart attack or stroke. Miss . Maclean, who regularly has palpitations and breathlessness, fears she . could die before she is allowed to have the operation. She . said: ‘I’m just going to be sitting around waiting for something bad to . happen. I was really shocked when they told me. When we went for the . meeting I thought the specialist was going to give me a date for the . operation, not tell me I couldn’t have it.’ The computer graphics apprentice, who has been off work for two months, added: ‘If I was younger or older, the NHS would do it. ‘The . NHS will only fund it  if I have a heart attack or a  stroke. That . could leave long-term  damage, or could even be life threatening. ‘I’m worried I may drop dead  if I exercise or do anything too strenuous. I can’t get on with  normal life.’ Miss . Maclean, from Abbeydale, Gloucestershire, developed problems three . years ago when doctors found a small hole between the left and right . atria of her heart during a routine check-up. But despite bouts of breathlessness, palpitations and headaches, she was told there was nothing the NHS could do. Cardiologists . advised her that a private procedure was the only way to guarantee her . health, at a minimum price of £16,000. She needs a procedure called a . ‘closure of a patent foramen ovale’, where a catheter is used to place a . permanent implant in her heart which will close the hole. The 19-year-old, pictured with her boyfriend Chris Prout, said doctors have said a £16,000 operation to close the hole and treat her is not available on the NHS. She suffers breathlessness and palpitations . Miss . Maclean, who is trying to raise money to have the operation privately, . is believed to be suffering ‘mini’ strokes, but such an episode would . have to be classed as ‘major’ before she will be given the operation on . the NHS. The only treatment she has received so far is blood-thinning . aspirin. She said: ‘My . consultant said to me that because of my age there are no studies about . the effects of a hole in the heart on my age group. ‘He . said all the symptoms and problems are not proven to have been caused . by [the hole] so there is no information to back up funding an . operation.’ Yesterday a . spokesman for her regional branch of NHS England said: ‘[The procedure] . is not routinely commissioned by the NHS and would only be considered if . the case is deemed exceptional by the individual’s clinician. NHS . England have not received an application regarding this case.’","Carla Maclean was diagnosed with a hole in her heart three years ago .

"Fifteen dehydrated migrants were found huddled in the back of a refrigerated lorry in the British countryside yesterday. Police stopped the HGV  after they received reports of noises coming from the back. The shivering migrants, who included women and a 15-year-old boy, told officers they were from Eritrea and Kashmir. Scroll down for video . A man has been arrested on suspicion of people smuggling after a lorry containing 15 immigrants - including a 15-year-old boy - from Eritrea and Kashmir suffering from dehydration were found at a service station in Ilminster. One of the stowaways leaves the lorry . Police arrived at the service station off the A303 in Ilminster at 1pm today where they made the discovery . It came just four days after 35 stowaways were found inside a sealed shipping container in an  Essex dockyard. In . the latest case, the migrants are thought to have boarded the lorry . somewhere between Belgium and Calais. They then spent at least eight . hours in temperatures as low as 2C (37F) next to pharmaceutical goods . bound for Devon. A German . man believed to be the driver was arrested after the lorry was . intercepted in Ilminster, Somerset, at around 1pm. He was quizzed on . suspicion of facilitating the unlawful entry of people into the UK. The . lorry, which belonged to the international refrigerated transportation . company Thermotraffic, has been seized. Avon and Somerset Police said . the migrants had been checked by paramedics and there were ‘no ongoing . concerns’ over their health. Meanwhile, . a suspected people trafficker was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter . yesterday over the death of one of the 35 Afghan Sikhs found at Tilbury . Docks on Saturday. Police stopped the 34-year-old man just after midday in Banbridge, Northern Ireland. He . is being questioned in connection with the death of Meet Singh Kapoor, . who died inside the sealed shipping container during a terrifying . journey on a cargo ferry. The lorry driver, who was in his late 30s, was held on suspicion of facilitating the unlawful entry of people into the UK . Police swooped on the HGV at Southfield Services in Ilminster, Somerset around 1pm after worried callers reported noises coming from the back of the vehicle . The . suspect is also said to have helped the Afghans illegally enter the UK . by stowing them inside the ‘metal coffin’ for 18 hours. Police are . searching his home in County Londonderry, and are due to send him to the . mainland for further questioning. The . Afghans were slowly suffocating when staff at the port freed them after . hearing screams and banging coming from inside the container. By . then, 40-year-old Mr Kapoor had already died as his wife and their two . sons – aged nine and 12 – slept nearby. The survivors were said to be 20 . minutes from death when they were found, and were ‘drifting in and out . of consciousness’. One of . them, a man in his 30s, told the Daily Mail: ‘The world can only imagine . what we’ve been through. Our minds are blank. We have had to go over . and over our ordeal in interviews with the Home Office.’ Some of the group could speak English and were thought to have been on the refrigerated lorry for 'several hours' The group were thought to be suffering from dehydration and were examined by paramedics at the scene . Meanwhile . it emerged that one Afghan mother had to resuscitate her five-year-old . son who had stopped breathing in the airless metal box. The . woman ‘desperately pounded at his chest’ said Kamaljit Singh Matharu, . who heard her harrowing account while acting as a translator for the . police. He added that the mother and her boy were ‘physically well but . mentally traumatised by their ordeal’. Mr . Matharu, 46, said the survivors  had also told him how they tried to . save Mr Kapoor by pounding his chest while others shouted at him to stay . awake. And he described how the 35 stowaways were forced to breathe . through one tiny hole in the sealed container as the smugglers had not . created enough ventilation for them. He added: ‘They told me they left for England six months ago, travelling through Europe by truck.‘They . said they remember stopping in Iran, Turkey and Greece. They said they . survived on food brought for them by the lorry driver. The group, which included men, women and a 15-year-old boy, were treated by paramedics at the scene for possible dehydration . Avon and Somerset Police has confirmed medical support and supplies have been provided and it is now working with the local authority to manage their ongoing welfare needs . Police sniffer dogs were also sent to the scene. Those in the lorry are now in the care of the local authority . Those in the lorry have been given food and water and have been taken to place of safety where police are speaking to them. They are believed to be from Kashmir and Eritrea and they can speak English . 'But . sometimes they would have to stop in very remote areas where there was . no access to food. They would have to survive on a pack of biscuits . given to them by the driver which they would share between the . children.’ The Afghan . stowaways, who included 13 children, arrived at Tilbury on a P&O . ferry from the Belgium port of Zeebrugge on Saturday morning. Some of . the survivors, whose  ages range from one to 72, were so dehydrated that . they had to be lifted out by police. Mr . Kapoor’s wife Jagtar Kaur and sons Mandeep and Aman are staying with . family in Feltham, west London. Last night, a relative said the family . was too distraught to comment. The other survivors are staying either with relatives or in emergency accommodation across Britain. They are all applying for asylum in the UK.

"Jane and Peter Howes (pictured) are both accused of fraud. They are seen arriving at Bristol Crown Court. He denies five counts of fraud . A jealous son faked his mother’s signature to cheat his older brother out of a £1.5million inheritance, a court heard yesterday. Peter Howes, 53, allegedly believed Jonathan, 55, was  the family favourite, and resented him for living in the Far East while he looked after their sick mother at home. The family estate should have been split between the brothers. But Peter faked the signatures of his brother and mother Joyce to steal the money, the court heard. He moved cash into an account held jointly with his mother, then siphoned it off into a personal account, using it to buy a stake in an online gaming company set up by a relative of his wife. He claimed to have made a list of everything he spent looking after his mother, intending to get it ‘back off her’, the court heard. When Joyce Howes, 81, died  in November 2011, Jonathan learned of the alleged deception from the family’s lawyers. Peter was arrested and charged with five counts of fraud. His wife Jane, 51, denies one count. Ed Burgess, prosecuting, said at the start of their joint trial  yesterday: ‘It is a case about a breakdown in a family, and who knows what lies behind it? ‘Peter Howes may well have thought, “My brother is off  living his life in Hong Kong or Singapore. I’m stuck here with mum. I will take what I can get my hands on”. There is some  talk of Jonathan always being the favourite son, and Peter and Joyce having a very difficult  relationship. But what is overwhelmingly obvious in this case is that he practised deceit. ‘In one case he was knowingly assisted by his wife in order to take money he knew he was not entitled to. Peter Howes was  taking for himself all of [Joyce’s] money in the last days of her life, although he knew full well that it was her intention that both the boys should benefit equally. ‘The total sums are just in excess of £1.5million.’ Bristol Crown Court heard the men’s father, Thomas Howes, set up a number of trusts in 2002. The brothers were told the assets should be ‘divided equally’, and Peter was made executor when their father died in August 2004. He wound up one settlement, sending half – or £109,000 – to  his brother in Hong Kong and convincing him the rest of the money was still in the trusts. But Peter then allegedly faked his mother’s and brother’s signatures to gain access to the money and close another settlement. Couple moved his elderly mother into their Gloucester home while continuing to defraud her - court heard. His brother Jonathan, who lives in Singapore, denied claims he had been the favourite child growing up . The . court was told his wife Jane countersigned one document. Handwriting . experts said the  signatures were not Joyce and Jonathan’s, something . neither defendant denies. In . 2009, Joyce Howes fell badly at the family home in Bexhill-on-Sea, East . Sussex. Her health deteriorated rapidly and she was forced to move in . with the couple in Lechlade, Gloucestershire. Peter . then set up an online joint account for him and his mother, and . transferred the proceeds of the estate into it. Bank records show the . money was later moved to his own account. He also sold the family home . for £1.1million. Jonathan gave permission by email, believing the money . would be used to move his mother out of Peter’s home. Jonathan, . a lawyer, said Joyce had been unhappy with his brother. He said: ‘I . remember  her saying, “Jane is very nice to me but I’m afraid Peter can . be very cruel”.’ He added that the brothers were ‘treated exactly the same’. Mr . Burgess told the court: ‘This is not a case that a woman who had lost . her mental faculties was exploited. Mentally . . . Joyce was competent, . which explains why Peter Howes felt it necessary to resort to fraud.’ Peter denies all five charges. The trial continues.

"Economics teacher: Russell Woolwright (pictured today outside Bournemouth Crown Court) was allegedly 'pestered' with messages from the pupil . A public school girl sent flirty emails to a male teacher before performing a sex act on him, a court heard yesterday. The teenager, who was studying at £30,000-a-year Canford School in Dorset, ‘pestered’ 30-year-old Russell Woolwright with messages asking him to meet her outside school, a jury heard. One was even titled ‘Party in my pants’, it was claimed. The unmarried economics teacher is alleged to have later kissed the girl and ‘caused or incited’ her to commit the sex act in an alleyway. The court heard Woolwright was first sent a number of emails by a friend of the complainant who told him the girl ‘wants you’, followed by ‘hurry up Russy Wussy’. When Woolwright failed to show up for the meeting in nearby Wimborne, the alleged victim messaged him, saying: ‘Russ you’re being ******* gay. Come on Russ.’ A further email he received on his mobile phone sent by the complainant had the subject heading: ‘Party in my pants.’ Another allegedly boasted of her sexual prowess. Police later learnt of the email exchange between the pair, prompting the girl to make the complaint of a breach of trust. At first she claimed Woolwright had kissed her but went on to describe the sex act in a second police interview after he denied her version of events. Woolwright, who no longer works at Canford School, denies two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a girl as an adult in a position of trust. Bournemouth Crown Court heard that Woolwright said he was shocked by the messages. He told police: ‘I started getting more emails and they started being more pestering. (She) sent the emails and said “party in my pants” and by that stage the alarm bells were really ringing.’ He said he tried to change the subject in the emails by joking with her, but when that failed he decided to meet with the girl to tell her to stop. But he said that when they were talking the girl twice tried to kiss him, at which point he told her to leave him alone. The court heard that in the days afterwards Woolwright contacted the girl and her friend several times to urge them to delete their emails. He said: ‘I didn’t think it was necessarily appropriate to go to the headmaster about. I felt I could deal with it. I should never have put myself anywhere near that sort of position.’ David Bartlett, prosecuting, has told the jury: ‘You might conclude the girls were leading the defendant on. That does not excuse the defendant’s behaviour.’ Yesterday Woolwright denied Mr Bartlett’s allegation that he had gone to a secluded area to engage in sexual activity with the girl. ‘None of that happened,’ he said. Woolwright, from Bristol, denies the charges. The trial continues. Teacher and pupil: The £30,000-a-year Canford School in Wimborne, Dorset, where Woolwright worked .

Last week Gascoigne's former teammates rallied around him as the star was admitted to Poole Hospital. Chris Waddle, who played in the 1990 World Cup where Gascoigne made his name, took to Twitter to offer his support. He tweeted: 'I know it's hard to stay focused but you have so many people who want you to come through this come on stay strong' Above a picture of the pair playing together for England, he then added: 'Love you mate'. Another of Gascoigne's Italia '90 teammates, Match of the Day Presenter Gary Lineker, also offered a serious message for the troubled star. In comments reported in the Daily Record, he said: 'Ultimately the support has got to come from Gazza himself. 'We've supported him over years, Tottenham and his friends.

"Coping with a fear of flying might require counselling, therapy or even just getting aboard and gritting your teeth until you’re back on terra firma. But pop down to a rather unremarkable industrial estate in Devon and you might be able to conquer your terrors for good. At least that’s what former pilot Andy Wilkins, 56, says. He has recreated the interior of a Boeing 737-800 in one of the estate’s units to help fearful flyers. Prepare for take off: Pilot Andy Wilkins has created a replica Boeing 737-800 to help people with flying phobias . The high-tech simulator is located in an industrial unit near Exeter in Devon . There’s a fully equipped cockpit and, . behind it, a cabin with the familiar small windows, overhead lockers and . seats with little leg room. The simulator also features announcements . from the ‘crew’ and the sounds that terrify nervous flyers. Mr . Wilkins, who took redundancy after 20 years with Thomson Airways, . counsels  clients and discusses the flying process with them. Clients . then use the simulator to ‘fly’ the plane themselves. Since . launching the Virtual Jet Centre in Newton Abbot, he has already helped . eight clients beat their fears. He said: ‘People have left saying that . instead of feeling nervous about a flight they were excited.’ Mr . Wilkins also offers pilot training, educational trips and corporate . events at the unit. It costs £100 per hour for a three-hour Fear of . Flying session. One client . was Emily Kaye, 38, who had to be prescribed Valium to fly. Since doing . Mr Wilkins’s course she has been on holiday to Greece and didn’t need . medication. She said: ‘I became more afraid as I got older. But I felt . 100 per cent better after the course and was able to fly to Greece with . no problems.’ The sky's the limit: A piloting the 737-800 simulator with Captain Andy Wilkins on the life changing course . Customer Emily Kaye and friend visit the  industrial unit near Exeter from which Andy runs his course . The nervous fliers take to the skies in the replica Boeing 737-800 as part of their Fear of Flying course . At the end of the three-hour long course, the client will then have the opportunity to use the high-tech simulator to fly the plane themselves. Since launching the Virtual Jet Centre in an industrial unit in Newton Abbot, Devon, four months ago, Andy has already helped eight people, including nervous flier Emily Kaye, 38, overcome their fears. Captain Wilkins has 30 years’ experience flying Airbus and Boeing passengers jets for a leading holiday airline. Take control: The course, which costs £100 per hours finishes with the chance to 'fly' the virtual aeroplane . He build the simulator at the Virtual Jet Centre to train pilots, offer flight experiences and corporate training days, as well as helping people overcome their fears of flight. The father-of-one said: 'The fear of flying is all about loss of control. When you go on an aircraft it is the one time you have to sit there with total lack of control of everything. 'What we are doing is empowering people through knowledge.'","Captain Andy Wilkins, 56, has built a replica Boeing 737-800 .

"California? Hawaii? No – this huge crowd of surfers is gathering in the waters off North Devon. This was the scene yesterday at Woolacombe, a spot proving more popular than ever with day-trippers and holidaymakers on the first weekend of August. Photographer Guy Harrop, who took these pictures at midday yesterday, said: ‘The beach was busier than I’ve seen it in years. Scroll down for video . Surf's up!

Britain . ‘The sea has been particularly warm . this year, so the difference between being in and out of the water isn’t . as stark as it usually is. ‘This makes surfing or swimming a much more attractive option, wetsuit or no wetsuit.’ Woolacombe . is a popular location for experienced surfers and beginners alike, with . a strong lifeguard presence and plenty of surfing schools and . instructors taking advantage of the sport’s ever increasing popularity. Yesterday it was reported that more and more of us are choosing to take our holidays in Britain rather than go abroad. Nearly . three-quarters of us are taking a ‘staycation’ this year, up from 33 . per cent in 2010, and 65 per cent last year, according to a survey by . Travelodge.

The . holiday rentals service HomeAway, which has about 20,000 UK properties . on its books, said inquiries for stays in Britain had risen by 32 per . cent compared with last year, with the West Country the most popular . area. For those who have chosen to stay in the UK, fortunes look fairly mixed. Yesterday there were warnings that after a Sunday which was sunny in many parts, showers will hit over the next seven days. Tomorrow . will be more unsettled, with more showers in the South and West, while . Wednesday will bring scattered heavy showers in the North and West. Thursday will be rainy and cloudy across most areas. Meanwhile . Sophie, Countess of Wessex seemed more than happy to brave the rain in . Glasgow for the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony.

The world's top athletes have so far been pleasantly surprised by Glasgow's weather at the Commonwealth Games. Even Usain Bolt remarked on the tournament's pleasant weather - although the rest was 'a bit sh**'. And . visitors to a farm in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, were treated to a . spectacular sea of golden yellow as sunflowers, that have come into . bloom, glistened in the sun.

Humid: Temperatures remain relatively high for Glasgow, in the high teens, but cyclists squinted as they pedalled through the worst of the rain forecast for tonight . Cheery: Spectators were undeterred by the dismal weather which marred the finale, lining the streets in raincoats and clutching umbrellas to cheer the cyclists on . But now, as . the country experiences warmer weather, more UK farmers are planting . the golden yellow blooms, which are used for bird seed and sunflower . oil. The flowers have . bloomed just before the tail-end of the lavender season, meaning much of . Hertfordshire's countryside is a kaleidoscope of colour. The fields have a few more days to flourish in the sunshine before showers hit and a rain system sweeps in from the south west. 'We . were expecting the sunflowers to open in another week, but lots of them . have suddenly opened up overnight,' said Tim Hunter, who helps run . family business Hitchin Lavender at Cadwell Farm in Hitchin. 'Traditionally . England doesn't have the growing conditions for sunflowers and they are . better suited to warmer climates with lots of sunshine and downpours of . rain. I . do like to be beside the seaside: Brighton Pier glistened in the summer . sun which coated the shore on the first weekend of August . Relaxing: Spectators at the Festival of British Eventing in Gatcombe Park, Gloucestershire, reclined on the grassy hills, catching the sun before showers hit . Summer time: It is typical August weather for the home counties, meaning a mix of high temperatures and sprinkling showers . 'The sunflowers . haven't looked very good for the last two years because last year it was . cold and a late start to the summer and in 2012 it was very wet. 'This . year the weather has been perfect for them with lots of sun, followed . by some heavy downpours, and we've got a great crop. ‘The lavender is still flowering and the fields look amazing next to each other. 'We think there may be at least two weeks now when the plants are in bloom together. ‘It's . a very unusual sight in Hertfordshire and one which more people would . associate with Provence so we've been getting lots of comments.'

'We . mainly grow lavender but decided to add sunflowers to extend the . season,' added Tim, who has 15 acres of lavender and two acres with . around 10,000 towering 5ft tall sunflowers. 'People . can pick the sunflowers and take photos in the fields. We hope they . will stay in bloom for at least three weeks as they are a really . magnificent sight.'

"Allegation: Russell Woolwright first kissed the alleged victim and then 'caused or incited' her to carry out the lewd act in an alleyway, a court heard . A male teacher at a leading public school persuaded a ‘flirty’ girl pupil to perform a sex act on him after she initiated a secret meeting, a court heard. Russell Woolwright, 30, was working at £30,000-a-year Canford School when he bumped into the teenager off the premises, it is alleged. The chance encounter, in October last year, led to the girl and her friend sending him messages on his school email account urging him to meet her again in a nearby town, the jury was told. It was said that during the liaison Woolwright, a former professional tennis player, kissed the alleged victim and then ‘caused or incited’ her to carry out the lewd act in an alleyway. Police later learnt about the matter. The girl, who cannot be named and whose exact age has not been revealed, told officers what happened, the court heard. She said that she did not want Woolwright to get into trouble because she liked him and was attracted to him. But the unmarried economics teacher has now gone on trial charged with two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a girl as an adult in a position of trust. He denies the charges. The court heard Woolwright was seeing a fellow teacher at the time of the alleged incident. David Bartlett, prosecuting, told the jury: ‘You might conclude the girls were leading the defendant on, that they were flirting with him. ‘That does not excuse the defendant’s behaviour towards her as he was an adult.’ Mr Bartlett said the girl initially insisted the pair had just kissed, but described the sex act in a second police interview a month later. He told Bournemouth Crown Court: ‘She said she didn’t want to get the defendant into trouble as she liked him. ‘When she found out the defendant had denied even doing that [kissing] she decided to tell the whole truth.’ Marcus Tregilgas-Davey, defending, said the girl had chosen to embellish her story to avoid being blamed for the alleged incident, which Woolwright (pictured) claims she initiated . Defending, Marcus Tregilgas-Davey said the girl had chosen to embellish her story to avoid being blamed for the alleged incident. He said: ‘I suggest you came up with this story to deflect criticism from you.’ The court heard that around two weeks after the alleged incident, the girl tried to contact Woolwright again via email. Asked why she did so, she replied: ‘We thought it would be funny when we were drunk.’ Russell Woolright no longer teaches at Canford School, pictured, in Wimborne, Dorset . Mr Tregilgas-Davey said: ‘I suggest that if you had engaged in sexual activity with him and it was something you were embarrassed about, the last thing you would want to do is make contact with him again.’ Canford School is a mixed independent school with around 630 pupils at its 300-acre campus on the River Stour near Wimborne, Dorset. Former pupils include Stephen Ward, the osteopath linked to the Profumo Affair, and film director Derek Jarman. Woolwright, from Bristol, no longer teaches at the school. The trial continues.

"Yasmin Thomas, 21, attacked Ronnie Lee with broken glass, leaving him with a deep gash just millimetres from his eye . A woman who smashed a broken glass . into a stranger’s face in a nightclub has been spared jail – despite it . being her 18th conviction for assault. Estate . agent Yasmin Thomas, 21, left her male victim with serious eye injuries . after she lunged at him with the potentially lethal object. A court heard she has already been convicted for 17 crimes of assault and battery. A judge branded Thomas’s criminal history ‘breathtaking’ and one of the worst he had ever seen of a woman her age. But . the female thug escaped with a 12-month sentence, suspended for two . years, and 80 hours community service after pleading guilty to a charge . of causing actual bodily harm. She was also ordered to attend anger management classes. Thomas . attacked Ronnie Lee, whom she did not know, in Bar So nightclub in . Bournemouth town centre after a row over an e-cigarette. Thomas’s friend had snatched it from a friend of Mr Lee, and had thrown it on the floor. Thomas . then picked it up and thrust the device at Mr Lee, demanding: ‘Are you . not going to say thank you? Who do you think you are?’ She then lunged towards Mr Lee with a broken glass, causing a serious gash to his left eyelid and two smaller cuts to his face. The . injuries were so close to his eye that Mr Lee feared he would lose his . sight. Tiny shards of glass were later removed from his eye. Prosecuting, . Carolyn Branford-Wood told Bournemouth Crown Court: ‘Miss Thomas, with a . glass in her hand, lunged towards Mr Lee, who felt a blow to his left . eye and blood trickling down his face.’ The court was told that Mr Lee was ‘very lucky’ not to have suffered any permanent damage following the brutal attack. Miss . Branford-Wood said  doctors initially feared he had suffered a . fractured eye socket following the assault, which also left him needing . stitches to the cut on his eyelid. Thomas, . who lives in Bournemouth, worked as a sales negotiator at Palmer Snell . estate agency. Yesterday the company refused to confirm whether Thomas . was still employed. In . mitigation, Audrey Archer said Thomas had been diagnosed with an . emotionally unstable personality disorder and had struggled to manage . her temper from childhood. She . said she had sought help from mental health services prior to . committing this offence and was waiting to undergo cognitive analytical . therapy. The Palmer Snell estate agents where Ms Thomas worked in Westbourne . Mrs Archer added that Thomas was trying to turn her life . around and, prior to the attack, her last offence was committed in . 2010. Thomas was also . ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge and £1,000 in compensation to Mr . Lee. Thomas has a record of violence which includes 17 previous convictions for assault . Sentencing her, judge John Harrow said: ‘You have a breathtaking . record of violence, one of the worst I have ever seen from anyone your . age. ‘It is not without a . lot of hesitation and some reservations, I must confess, that I’m going . to suspend that 12 month sentence for two years.’ He . added: ‘Any offence at all will be sent back to this court and you will . go straight down those steps to prison for at least 12 months.’ Yesterday . residents of Bournemouth questioned the judge’s decision. One wrote . online: ‘So what do you actually have to do to go to prison these days?’ Another comment read: ‘It’s barbaric that she has avoided jail. 'She is a danger to the public and disgrace to society.’ Last . night Tobias Ellwood, Conservative MP for Bournemouth East, said: ‘I am . particularly concerned that the judge mentioned that he suspended . [Thomas’s] sentence with ‘a lot of hesitation and some reservations’. 'He . was clearly troubled by her record.’ Mr . Ellwood, who was himself the target of a violent attack after he . reprimanded a group of youths, added: ‘This is now the third case of . this nature that I have seen in Bournemouth in recent months. 'So I will . now be seeking a meeting with the Attorney General to discuss these . particular cases and to ask whether changes to the law are necessary to . ensure that cases of this kind do not occur again.’ Dorset . police, the Crown Prosecution Service and Bournemouth Crown Court all . refused to disclose details of Thomas’s previous convictions, all of . which occurred when she was under 18.","Yasmin Thomas attacked Ronnie Lee with broken glass in Bournemouth club .

Yet these walkers dangling their legs over a drop of several hundred feet don’t seem to mind the added risk – a huge crack in the cliff edge.

"Take a rusty old boat, a few smoke bombs and a rather anticlimactic sinking. Put them together and, believe it or not, you have an art project that is judged to be worth £50,000 of taxpayers’ money. Artist Simon Faithfull bought the 24ft Brioney Victoria on eBay for £75. He lit smoke bombs to make it look as if it was on fire, then opened its valves, filling it with water. As it sank, he dived into the sea. And the point of this performance? The boat had been fitted with underwater cameras, which will film for a year as it grows into an artificial reef off the Dorset coast. Footage will be sent to a phone app so people can watch live, and will later be made into a film. Scroll down for video . Dramatic display: British artist Simon Faithfull leaps from the side of the concrete fishing boat as it begins to sink off the coast of Weymouth, Dorset. He set off smoke bombs to make it look like the vessel was on fire . The REEF project will cost £120,000, nearly half funded by the Arts Council. The rest will come from European Union grants. Mr Faithfull, 48, the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, said: ‘A boat that was at the end of its life is now starting a new one.’ REEF was commissioned by Fabrica and Photoworks, groups supported by the Arts Council. It cost £80,000 to sink the boat and consult marine experts, of which £32,000 came from the Arts Council. An extra £40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in Brighton and France, of which the Council will pay half. The boat has been fitted with five underwater cameras which will record the 12-month journey of the ‘dead’ boat being brought back to life in the form of an artificial reef for marine life. The footage will be streamed live and a film will eventually be made and shown at art exhibitions. But the project has been slammed by some after it emerged that nearly half of the £120,000 spent on the project has been funded by the British taxpayer through grants from the Arts Council. It was commissioned by Fabrica and Photoworks, two arts organisations in Brighton supported by the Arts Council.The remaining cost has come through European Union arts grants. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers struggling with rising bills will be baffled that they’ve been asked to pay to sink a boat in the name of art. 'If this project was worthwhile then private investment should have been sought. This sort of wasteful spending by unaccountable quangos and local authorities has to come to an end.' Going under: The ship dips below the waves. Five underwater cameras have been attached to the vessel to document the 'dead' ship's journey over the next year as it becomes an artificial reef for marine life . The project, called REEF, has taken three years to come to fruition because of the level of planning and consultation from marine experts required. Mr Faithfull, who is the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, said: 'The idea was to take a boat and send her on a short journey to the bottom of the sea. 'I bought the concrete hull of a disused boat on eBay then added a concrete wheelhouse so it replicated a working boat. We had very strict permissions and the boat was stripped of anything that could potentially be harmful. 'I was on board the boat and we set up pyrotechnics to look like a fire so it looked like the boat was in trouble. 'Then I opened the seacocks and let water into the boat. As it went down I dived off to symbolise abandoning ship. He explained that the boat has been rigged with five cameras that transmitted the sinking and will continue to transmit live for the next year so people can see it transform into a reef. The cameras will broadcast to a mobile app for a year and the film will eventually be shown at exhibitions in Brighton, Calais and Caen in France. Of the £120,000 that the project cost, £80,000 went into buying, building and towing the boat and consulting with marine experts. Of that money, £32,000 was funded by the Arts Council with the rest being met by grants from Interreg, a scheme funded by the European Regional Development Fund to encourage European projects to work together. A further £40,000 will be spent on exhibitions in Brighton, Caen and Calais, half of which will be met by the Arts Council and half by Interreg. Creative family: Simon Faithfull, pictured left, is the half-brother of singer Marianne Faithfull, pictured right earlier this year. One of his recent art projects involved him walking through a burning plane . Laurence Hill from Fabrica, one of the main backers of the project, added: 'Eventually there will be an exhibition at Fabrica with an edited version of the film we took of the sinking. 'In was an amazing success and a real relief after all the planning that has gone into it. It was a relatively expensive project because of all the experts involved in it. Mr Faithfull’s recent art projects have involved films of him walking through a burning plane and walking across the sea bed. He also sent a chair to the edge of space beneath a weather balloon in the name of art.","Artist Simon Faithfull bought a disused concrete boat on eBay .

"This is the heartwarming video when Ellen DeGeneres sent 'Apparently' boy Noah Ritter to go walking with dinosaurs. The five-year-old from Pottstown, Pennsylvania became an internet sensation after appearing on a live TV interview in August following the Wayne County Fair in Pennsylvania. He was invited on the Ellen DeGeneres show where he proved such a hit, producers decided to send him on a VIP trip to Walking With Dinosaurs. Scroll down for video . Little Noah Ritter warns paleontologist Thomas Huxley 'not move a muscle' when the T-Rex approached . As the five-year-old was introduced to the Triceratops, pictured, the giant dinosaur sneezes . When face to face with the T-Rex, Noah covers his ears as the giant dinosaur roars . Noah met with a paleontologist Thomas Huxley before being introduced to three animatronic dinosaurs. Mr Huxley asked Noah to close his eyes as the first dinosaur approached. The youngster jumped as the robot animal let out a roar. Noah said: 'That's a Stegosaurus.' The five-year-old was able to explain that the Stegosaurus was heavily armoured with protective plates on his back and wouldn't die 'without a fight'. Next up was the Triceratops. When asked whether the beast was a predator or a herbivore, Noah replied: 'He's a plant eater. I've seen a lot of dinosaur movies in my day.' Mr Huxley asked Noah to close in on the animal when it sneezed. 'He just sneezed on me,' cried Noah as he ran of to safety. Finally, when the T-Rex approached, Noah advised: 'Do not move a muscle. That's a T-Rex. He would tear my arm off in a second.' At the end of his visit, Noah had an endearing message to the television host: 'Thank you Ellen for sending me. I had a great time, even though i got sneezed on by a Triceratops. It wasn't real boogers. It was just water.' Noah Ritter has a gentle introduction to dinosaurs meeting a Stegosaurus with paleontologist Thomas Huxley . He later returned to the studio where he gave host Ellen DeGeneres a full lowdown on his escapade . Noah became an internet sensation after an unprompted interview in which he endearingly used the word 'apparently' eight times - without even knowing what it meant. But the big news of the night was when he told the crowd that 'he got over' the word 'apparently'- whether he ever learned what it meant or how it is spelt is uncertain. When asked what his new preferred word was, he jubilantly proclaimed 'seriously' before launching into an arm-waving celebration. After achieving world-fame with his hilarious first interview with WNEP TV at the Wayne County Fair in Honesdale, Pennsylvania - Noah may struggle to reach such heights again with his new word. The confident toddler affectionately hugged the chat show hostess after walking on to the stage . Noah Ritter became an internet sensation after an interview with WNEP TV last month. A newscaster is seen approaching him on the opening day of the Wayne County Fair in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. While reporter Sofia Ojeda was seeking a verdict on the ride he had just been on with his grandfather, Noah had his own agenda. Reporter Sofia Ojeda struggles to keep a straight face in the interview  -which has more than 15 million YouTube views . Exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently', he said: 'It was great and apparently I’ve never been on live television but apparently sometimes I don’t watch the news because I’m a kid and apparently every time Grandpa just gives me the remote I have to watch the Powerball.' The preschooler was clearly excited to share his views, confidently holding the microphone and speaking in a somewhat newscaster-y voice. Still attempting to get her soundbite, Ms Ojeda asked again how Noah had enjoyed his ride, only to get more of his adorable perspective on life. 'Well, it was great because apparently you’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that’s all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I’ve never ever been on live television. I've never been on live television.' The amused reporter, who is seen crouching down to speak at his level, asks: 'Are you excited?' To which Noah replies: 'Yeah, and apparently I only went down the super slide. . . I was scared half to death. I just freak out.' Noah used the word 'apparently' no less than eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview, and repeated that he had never been on live television three times. Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, who had accompanied him to the fair, told ABC News: 'Noah is pretty talkative.

"What with missing screws, fiddly flat packs and baffling instructions, shopping at Ikea can be a stressful experience. And if all that isn’t enough to raise your heart rate, it has now emerged that UK customers are paying up to three times as much for the privilege as our foreign counterparts. The Swedish company has been accused of charging British buyers more than consumers in the US and Europe for its products. Scroll down for video . Rip off: Ikea are charging UK customers up to four times as much as those in the US and Sweden . At the cheaper end of its range, a £5 Knalla bag costs the equivalent of just £1.61 in the US, while one of its £100 swivel chairs here can be bought for £59 in America. And a collection of ten popular products is said to cost £500 more here than the items would across the Atlantic – where Ikea is even cheaper than in its home country. It has previously been argued that prices for Ikea products are steeper in the UK because the cost of doing business is higher in this country. Marketing experts have also suggested that the British welfare state props up prices because it guarantees a certain level of income – which means retailers can get away with charging more in the UK than in other nations. Yesterday, a spokesman for the firm, which has 338 stores in 40 countries – including 18 in the UK – said prices were affected by a range of factors specific to each nation. Emily Birkin, UK sales manager for Ikea, said: ‘Low price is the cornerstone of the Ikea vision – and we will always remain focused on giving our customers the best value for money. Difference: A Knalla bag (left) costs four times as much in the UK as it does in the US whereas a Brimnes double bed frame (right) is £30 more . Price gap: A Hemnes TV storage combination costs £649 in UK stores, but only £473 on the other side of the Atlantic . ‘Prices are subject to a number of factors in every country such as exchange rates, VAT, corporation taxes, wages, energy prices and transportation costs. ‘All of these factors have an impact on the total cost. We always aim to give customers in the UK the lowest price for comparable products sold by any competitor.’ However Marc Gander, from the Consumer Action Group, said he believed British shoppers were being treated like Ikea’s ‘cash cows’. He added: ‘Ikea are making tweaks and changes in their approach which mean they can bang the prices up for British consumers. They are doing it for their shareholders, but it means British customers pay the price.’ Cheaper stateside: A Skurvsta chair (left) will set you back £59 in the US, almost double (£109) what it costs in the UK.

"Essendon players face the prospect of suspensions after the AFL club lost its court battle with Australia's anti-doping authority over its supplements program. Justice John Middleton took just 30 minutes to deliver the finding in the Federal Court on Friday. He ruled the  nature of the investigation by ASADA and the AFL was legal, meaning current and past players may now face suspensions as a result. Scroll down for video . AFL Essendon coach James Hird and the Essendon Football Club has had its case against the ASADA anti-doping agency dismissed . The sidelined coach was present at Friday's ruling in the Federal Court handed down by  Justice John Middleton . Middleton found that ASADA's investigation into Essendon's 2012 supplement's program was legal . The club has until October 1 to appeal the findings and have been ordered to  pay ASADA's court costs. Justice Middleton said ASADA complied with the rule of law in establishing and conducting the investigation. 'In my view, ASADA complied with the rule of law in establishing and conducting, in the manner and for the purposes it did, the investigation. Justice Middleton said coach James Hird and players would have been aware that the interviews they were giving would be used by ASADA. 'In addition, ASADA lawfully provided the Interim Report to the AFL, which has subsequently been acted upon by the AFL in bringing disciplinary charges against Essendon and Mr Hird.' Middleton dismissed Essendon and coach Hird's claim that the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority had conducted an illegal investigation into its 2012 supplements program. He said, in his view, ASADA complied with the 'rule of law' in establishing and conducting its investigation. The ruling means the show cause notices issued to 34 past and present Essendon players alleging doping offences stand. James Hird and wife Tania appearing at a hearing into his case against ASADA earlier in the year . 34 current and past players of the Essendon Football Club may now face possible sanctions . Justice Middleton argued the anti-doping agency's interim report against Hird and club officials was a fair report. He said ASADA acted for a proper purpose in providing the report to the AFL in its bit to pursue disciplinary action against the club and its officials, including Hird. 'On the evidence before the court, the investigation disclosed a strong link between deficient governance and management practices at Essendon and the possibility of Essendon players being involved in anti-doping violations.' 'The poor governance and management practices at Essendon were related to possible anti- doping violations by Essendon players, to the extent that such violations may have been systematic, or may have occurred because proper governance and management practices were not in place. 'This seems to have been the very situation that existed at Essendon.' Justice Middleton referred to former ASADA CEO Aurora Andruska, who oversaw the supplements investigation, as a 'truthful witness' who 'provided convincing and credible explanations for the steps she or her investigators took.' 'There is no pleaded case alleged by either Essendon or Mr Hird that Ms Andruska as CEO improperly delegated any of her functions or powers, or in any other way abrogated her responsibilities,' he said. He also did not accept evidence that James Hird was threatened and pressured into accepting responsibility for the AFL club's supplements program. 'The 34 Players and Mr Hird had agreed to subject themselves to compulsory interviews,' he said. Essendon and Hird have 21 days in which to lodge an appeal .

"Theresa May has been criticised by the opposition after the collapse of a sham marriage trial . Home Secretary Theresa May has come under fire for ‘unbelievable’ failures over sham marriages. Labour’s immigration spokesman David Hanson criticised the Home Office’s inability to get on top of the problem and accused ministers of mismanaging the situation. His comments came following the collapse of a trial of an imam accused of conducting 580 sham marriages, after the Home Office failed to hand over paperwork in time. Mr Hanson called on Mrs May to ‘make clear what steps she will be taking to ensure this doesn’t happen again’. He added: ‘Sham marriages undermine public trust in our immigration system and can present a serious threat to our borders. ‘So it’s unbelievable that officials on Theresa May’s watch can’t be bothered to do the paperwork on time to prosecute someone who might be responsible for sham marriages on an almost industrial scale. 'It’s a clear sign of the mismanagement by ministers that vital work to ensure someone engaging in defrauding the country with sham marriages wasn’t done in time and means no further action can be taken. 'I share the public’s anger at such poor management by ministers and think the Home Secretary needs to make clear what steps she’ll be taking to ensure this doesn’t happen again.’ Mohammed Mattar, 62, was due to stand trial at Isleworth Crown Court after he was said to have presided over bogus weddings at his Islamic bookshop in west London. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the charges after government investigators missed deadlines to hand over vital information. MPs warned earlier this year in a report that bogus marriages are increasing at an ‘alarming rate’, with as many as 10,000 a year feared to be carried out. They called it an ‘industry of deceit’. In July, the Home Affairs Select Committee questioned whether the Government knew the ‘scale of the problem’ and called for better training for registrars to spot sham marriages. Registrars told the committee they were left presiding over what they knew to be a ‘charade’, and were powerless to stop it. The trials of Mohammed Mattar, left, and Reverend Nathan Ntege, right, both collapsed, apparently due to Home Office blunders . David Hanson criticised the Home Office’s accused ministers of mismanaging the situation . A TV documentary also showed the ease with which migrants could marry to get a British passport. An undercover journalist exposed the scale of the problem by meeting her Indian ‘fiance’, Ali, through a self-styled bogus marriage ‘fixer’ online – and agreeing to marry him for £5,000. He and reporter Harriet Morter were allowed to wed even though Ali forgot his bride’s name and claimed he could not remember the borough where she lived. It was called off at the last minute. The number of suspicious marriages reported had rocketed in the early years of the last Labour government, but plummeted in 2005 when non-EU nations were required to apply to the Home Office to marry. But the numbers reported have crept up since then from 934 in 2010 to 2,135 last year. This year John Vine, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, told the select committee the ‘widespread abuse of the system was ‘one of the biggest potential threats to immigration control’ and claimed there were no proper checks. In the Channel 5 programme, screened last night, Mark Rimmer, the superintendent registrar at Brent Council said the number of sham marriages was ‘absolutely enormous’.","Labour's immigration spokesman accused ministers of mismanaging .

"The Australian bride charged with adultery and bigamy offences while visiting her boyfriend in Lebanon has tearfully told of how she was scared her new man would leave her. 'He risked his whole life for me,' Sydney mother Mahassen Issa told Channel Seven's Sunday Night program, in an interview to air at the weekend. ''I was honestly scared that he would, because anyone would run - I would!' 'If I was in a predicament like that and I was going to jail I would run. '(But) he didn't. I never left him and he didn't leave me.' Scroll down for videos . Distressing time: Ms Issa spent around two months on the run from Lebanese authorities. She has sat down for an interview with the Seven Network's Sunday Night program . Dressed in white and wielding a bouquet of roses, Ms Issa entered a commitment ceremony with her new partner, Mohammed Awick. The pictures, posted online, would lead to her being accused of bigamy . 'In love': Sunday Night reporter Steve Pennells told Daily Mail Australia Ms Issa and Mr Awick have a very real relationship . While there were conflicting reports over whether Ms Issa was charged with bigamy and adultery charges, Mr Pennells said she faced both . Having separated from her husband, Bassam Abou Lokmeh, Ms Issa travelled to Lebanon on June 20 and met her new partner, Mohammed Awick. Mr Lokmeh saw pictures of Ms Issa and Mr Awick allegedly marrying in early July and alerted authorities, beginning a months-long hunt for Ms Issa. But Ms Issa told Sunday Night the pictures were actually of a commitment ceremony, rather than a wedding. Reporter Steve Pennells, who travelled with Ms Issa during her time on the run, said she was desperate and at risk of 'real danger' while in Lebanon. 'At times, she was frantic, scared and demoralised, verging on hysterical - she was pushed to the edge,' Mr Pennells said. Dark times: While stuck in Lebanon, Ms Issa heard rumours her home had been rented out without her consent . When Ms Issa, pictured here with partner Mohammed Awick, travelled to Lebanon in June she only expected to stay for two weeks . Ms Issa was 'disowned' by her family while she was marooned in Lebanon . Ms Issa, who was only meant to stay in Lebanon for two weeks, was unable to see or talk to her two children, both under the age of 10. She had no money, Mr Pennells said, and even heard reports her house had been rented out without her consent and possessions taken or sold. In July, husband Mr Lokmeh told Daily Mail Australia his wife was 'a devil... This lady, she's a devil.' He expressed outrage that his wife had married another man before their divorce was finalised and had 'deserted our children'. Relatives said they had 'disowned' her, with one telling Daily Mail Australia Ms Issa was crying so sympathetic Australians would come to her aid. 'We tried to put a stop to it but she decided to proceed with her marriage in Lebanon...now it has backfired on her. 'She's not going to jail because of adultery, she's going to jail because she got married while she was still married. 'That's illegal everywhere, not just in Lebanon. All she's doing is crying out for Australia to help her.' Ms Issa resurfaced in Australia in earlier this month. It remains unclear how she returned as her passport was 'flagged' by the Lebanese Government following the charges. Ms Issa applied to bring an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) against Mr Lokmeh at Bankstown Local Court on October 9, but her application was dismissed. Sunday Night marketing material said Ms Issa experienced 'the biggest, most shocking, unexpected twist of all' when she returned to Australia. At the heart of Ms Issa's saga, Mr Pennells said, was a 'very, very messy break-up story'.

"After months of testing, leaked screenshots and videos, Apple has officially announced its iOS in the car service goes live this week. Called CarPlay, the integrated system gives drivers a 'smarter, safer and more fun way to use an iPhone in the car.' It works by linking the car's built-in display and software with iOS 7 and Siri on the iPhone 5, 5C and 5S - and will be rolled out to compatible Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo later this week. Scroll down for video . Apple's CarPlay uses Siri voice commands to control entertainment and other in-car features. Researchers from Texas Transportation Institute recently found that using voice controls to send text messages while driving - on software including Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers . In April last year Texas researchers found . that using voice commands to send text messages while driving - on software such . as Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers. They found that both methods impacted . driver response times equally - but that it often took voice . recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages. The findings were then confirmed by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in . the U.S in June. It similarly found that as mental workload and distractions increase, . reaction times get slower and brain function is compromised. In the run up to the CarPlay release, Apple added Eyes-Free technology to its latest iOS software. The Siri Eyes-Free tool lets users control this the system by voice so they can keep their eyes on the road. Once an iPhone is connected to a vehicle fitted with CarPlay, Siri can be used to access the phone’s contacts, make calls, return missed calls and listen to voicemails. When a user receives an incoming message or notification, they can reply using voice commands. Siri can also read the messages and let drivers dictate longer responses or emails. While driving, CarPlay can guess destinations by scanning the phone’s calendar for appointments, and when used with Apple Maps, Siri will give instructions, warn of any traffic incidents and keep the driver updated with the estimated time of arrival. Drivers can also ask Siri for turn-by-turn directions, which are shown on the car’s built-in display. Elsewhere, CarPlay can be used to control music, podcasts and audiobooks on the car’s display, or by asking Siri to pull up what they’d like to hear. CarPlay also works with select third-party apps such as Spotify and iHeartRadio. Drivers' brainwaves were monitored while they talked on the phone and while voice-activated emails were played to them, in a system similar to that used in Apple's CarPlay, pictured. Talking on a phone resulted in a moderate risk, but listening to voice-activated features was classed as an extensive risk . Elsewhere, CarPlay can be used to control music, podcasts and audiobooks on the car's display, pictured, or by asking Siri to pull up what they'd like to hear. CarPlay also works with select third-party apps such as Spotify and iHeartRadio . ‘CarPlay has been designed from the ground up to provide drivers with an incredible experience using their iPhone in the car,’ said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of iPhone and iOS Product Marketing. ‘iPhone users always want their content at their fingertips and CarPlay lets drivers use their iPhone in the car with minimised distraction. We have an amazing lineup of auto partners rolling out CarPlay, and we’re thrilled it will make its debut this week.’ A leaked video, posted by app developer Steven Troughton-Smith at the end of January, hinted to what the technology would look like. Troughton-Smith shared screenshots, like the one pictured, about what CarPlay might look like . Other car makers including BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Peugeot Citroën, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota will be shipping CarPlay-compatible cars later this year.

Google has also been in talks with car manufacturers, including Audi, to add a similar, Android-based system into cars later this year. Commenting on the news, Patrick Salyer, CEO of Gigya said:' There's an all out war for identity on the web and Apple has taken a first step towards entering the fray. 'The internet of things is now clearly becoming a part of consumers’ everyday lives, and while Apple’s extension to the driver’s seat is a positive sign, Apple would benefit in many more ways if it opened up Apple ID as an identity provider across devices and platforms. 'Having Apple ID in our cars is a great initial step, but the 'internet of things' will continue to be a throng of siloed devices until these gadgets can talk to one another through identity. For Apple, there's a much broader, and more lucrative market to address in identity.'","Integrated system works by linking a smart car's display with an iPhone .

"A $600,000 steel sculpture has been dismantled after it burned a hole through a man's jacket by reflecting rays of the sun. The 16-foot artwork, made up of two silver hemispheres, was billed as an 'interactive' structure that could turn text messages into a light and sound display if visitors used their phones inside it. But the interaction went a touch further than expected when a man heard a sizzling sound - and watched as a hole appeared on his chest. A bit too interactive: This $600,000 steel sculpture reflected a ray of light onto a man's jacket, burning a hole . According to the Calgary Herald, the man stood inside the sculpture, as directed, and tried to text through the metal in order to create a light effect. Within seconds, a sun ray bounced off the interior and refracted into a narrow beam of light aimed directly at the man - and it was powerful enough to singe his jacket. The visitor was uninjured, but the incident prompted city officials to place a blue fence around the sculpture to keep people from venturing inside. Blasting city leaders, the center's president Carol Steiner - a physics graduate - raged that the issue could have been solved by a first year science student. 'You put a spherical surface out there in the sun — what did you expect?' she told the Herald. 'And what really gets me is they said, 'We had no idea.' Really. They should have had an idea. I mean, an elementary physics student, year one, could figure that out, find the focal point of that mirror.' Anger: City officials have now been forced to dismantle the piece outside the Genesis Centre in Calgary . Officials at the Genesis Center for the Community of Wellness in Calgary, Canada, have now conceded that the structure - a gift from Berkeley, California, in fall 2012 - has to be taken down. 'It's a beautiful, shiny object. And that, I think is part of the problem,' Sarah Iley, the city's art and culture manager, told the Herald. The burning incident, which took place last summer, was the latest in a number of controversies surrounding the bespoke artwork, including disputes over the cost, scale and location of the piece. The issues have been a cause of outrage in the city, with authorities complaining the public never had a chance to appreciate it before protective fencing was put up. 'Here you have what's supposed to be this impressive piece of art and I think it was fairly impressive and then you've got this ugly construction fence around it, and it's at the main entrance, in a place of honour,' Genesis Centre president Carol Steiner said. They altered the angle of the structure, dulled the interior, and attempted to smooth certain parts of it using a hammer. However, a year of attempts has failed to resolve the issues. It will now be put in storage while they attempt to come up with a more permanent solution.","$600,000 16ft steel sphere was given to Calgary, Canada, from California .

"British combat troops will not be deployed in Afghanistan again ‘under any circumstances’, the Defence Secretary has vowed. Michael Fallon said yesterday: ‘We are not going to send combat troops back into Afghanistan. We’ve made that very, very clear. Under any circumstances, combat troops will not be going in there.’ His comments came as British troops were forced to make one last assault on Taliban positions as they prepared for withdrawal from Camp Bastion. Royal Artillery gunners fired 105mm shells from the base into enemy positions several miles outside the wire. Scroll down for video . Last mission: As British troops prepared to withdraw from Camp Bastion, the Royal Artillery 105mm light gun crew fire out and over the perimeter of the base on their last fire mission to deter Taliban . As the UK prepares to withdraw all combat personnel from Afghanistan by the end of the year, Mr Fallon admitted ‘mistakes were made’ by both senior military officials and politicians during the campaign in the country. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘I think the generals have been clear that mistakes were made. Mistakes were made militarily and mistakes were made by the politicians at the time. ‘Clearly the numbers weren’t there at the beginning, the equipment wasn’t quite good enough at the beginning, and we have learnt an awful lot from the campaign. Mistakes: Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that 'mistakes were made' by both senior military officials and politicians during the campaign in Afghanistan . ‘But don’t let’s ignore what has been achieved. ‘We have now some six million people in school in Afghanistan, three million of them girls. There is access in Helmand to healthcare and to education in that province that simply didn’t exist ten years ago.’ Military chiefs admitted yesterday that only ‘time will tell’ whether the Afghan National Security Forces will be able to keep Camp Bastion and the Helmand province out of the hands of the Taliban. But they said the British campaign in the country had given a new ‘sense of hope’ to the Afghan people and made streets in the UK safer from terrorist threats. Brigadier Rob Thomson, the most senior British officer in Helmand, said: ‘What we have achieved is something we can be proud of.

We are happy we are all going back to our families but we are also sad because we are leaving behind some friends who were courageous on the battlefield.’ Thousands of British servicemen fought for eight years in the heat and dust of Helmand province to keep it out of the hands of the Taliban. They were picked off by snipers, blown up by roadside bombs and 453 men and women lost their lives.

The British forces will spend the next few weeks shipping the remaining equipment back to the UK before flying home. While logistics units, medics and infantry soldiers will head to the huge air base, it is understood about 500 troops will stay in Kabul, where they will train Afghan Army officers in a mission codenamed Operation Toral, and known as ‘Sandhurst in the Sand’. Their new mission will be to train, advise and assist the Afghan forces as they continue to fight insurgents in the war-torn country. Western officials insist the Afghan security forces – which have been trained by US and UK personnel – have managed to contain the Taliban’s offensives on their own.

The Afghan National Army and police force now number almost 340,000 – though much of their focus is on Kabul and the government has struggled to extend its unity beyond the capital. The Taliban have been launching attacks ahead of the withdrawal of most foreign forces by the end of this year. The insurgents’ alarming gains in the south and east recently raise the nightmare prospect of the Taliban taking over swathes of land and assaulting the rest of the country. In the northern province of Kunduz, there are now two districts almost entirely under Taliban rule, local officials have said. The Taliban are administering legal cases and schools, and even allowing international aid operations to work there, it was claimed in the New York Times. Similarly, in the Tangi Valley in the Wardak province, just an hour’s drive from Kabul, the Taliban are said to be in control of the everyday life of much of the population. A BBC Panorama investigation found they are using the valley as a staging post for attacks on the capital as it tries to seize back the country.","Michael Fallon says British combat troops would not return to Afghanistan .

In the first, the organ – donated by Brian’s sister Pam Morphett – was removed through her groin rather than her abdomen, leaving her with a far less visible scar. Brian Blanchard, 51, is the first person in the UK to have a kidney transplant by keyhole surgery. His sister, Pam (right), donated one of her kidneys to him . In the second, the kidney was inserted through an incision in Brian’s abdomen measuring just two and a half inches. Previously, a ten-inch opening would have been needed for the operation. Surgeons say the new techniques pave the way for safer transplant operations, and to patients recovering more quickly. Brian, from New Brighton, Merseyside, who now runs an engineering company owner, says he is proud to be the UK’s first patient for this procedure. ‘The surgeon told me it would mean less pain and a quicker recovery,’ he says. ‘To be honest, I was just delighted that my sister turned out to be a tissue and blood type match so was able to help. My scar is already barely visible – I’m amazed how they managed to insert the kidney through such a small hole. It’s only three weeks since the operation, and I’m already out walking the dog.’ His sister, 57, also from New Brighton, who is married with two grown-up children, was happy to spare Brian dialysis treatment but also delighted with her inconspicuous scar. ‘I’m not vain, but the surgeon’s done a lovely job,’ she says. ‘The scar won’t be visible even when I’m in a swimming costume.’ The developments were made possible after surgeons at one of Britain’s largest kidney transplant units, at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, were given a masterclass in keyhole transplantation by Professor Pranjal Modi, visiting from India. Prof Modi first developed a minimally invasive transplant in 2010 – a ‘scarless’ laparoscopic removal of the kidney through the belly button – and he has since carried out 172 at his hospital in Ahmedabad, northern India. But until last month, the procedure had not been performed anywhere else in the world. Prof Modi also perfected the skill of taking a donor organ out via the groin instead of higher up. Both techniques are intended to boost recovery by reducing post-operative pain and the risk of infection, leading to patients leaving hospital sooner. Sanjay Mehra, the transplant surgeon who brought Prof Modi to the UK, says: ‘The idea is to make a transplant a smaller and safer operation because we are working through a much smaller incision. ‘There are many operations that have now become minimally invasive, but the challenge with kidney transplantation is that we need to get the organ plumbed in within about an hour of it being taken out of its cooling storage box, which stops it from deteriorating while detached from the circulation. ‘The skill is getting stitching of the blood vessels and the ureter – the tube leading to the bladder – done within that time-frame using cameras to guide you. It’s not something that can be learned overnight and there is quite a steep learning curve, which is why only a handful of surgeons have learned this technique so far. ‘We are aiming to get the kidney into the patient in around 40 to 50 minutes. That’s a little longer than the quickest open transplants, but it’s possible as Professor Modi has shown. ‘It is worthwhile when you look at the size of Brian’s scar and the speed of his recovery.’ Although only a small incision is made, with four small holes nearby used to insert the keyhole instruments and camera, the space is made wider by surgical retractors. This allows the donor kidney – which measures about 5in by 2in – to be squeezed into place. In most cases, the recipient’s own non-functioning kidneys remain in place, against the back muscles in the upper abdominal area, just below the ribcage. They sit opposite each other on both the left and right side of the body; the right kidney sits a little lower than the left to accommodate the size of the liver. The new kidney is placed on the lower right or left side of the abdomen where it is connected to nearby blood vessels. Placing the kidney in this position allows it to be easily connected to blood vessels and the bladder. ‘Open surgery for transplants is a good operation but if we can safely modernise then we should,’ says Mr Mehra. ‘It benefits the patient, reduces some of the risks of infection, cuts post-surgical pain and gets them home and active more quickly.’ Without a new kidney, Brian would have been using a dialysis machine (file pic) regularly for the rest of his life . Brian, who is married with two teenage children, was the first of three patients to get the transplant. Twenty-five surgeons from all over Europe watched the operation. Mr Mehra has been to India to assist Prof Modi, and helped again with Brian’s operation, but has still to master the intricacies of speedy and safe suturing using the keyhole approach. ‘I am still learning the techniques on models in the lab, but I hope to be able to offer this to my patients in Liverpool next year,’ he says. ‘We will have to get approval from the hospital for it to be a routine operation here, and it has been agreed that Professor Modi will decide when I am ready.’ Brian has not only been spared a large incision in the abdomen, he was also given another bonus. The transplant team inserted his new kidney through an old appendix scar, sparing him a new scar. He says: ‘I’m chuffed that I only have one scar and not two. The surgeons did a fantastic job and I’m full of admiration for their skill.’ Currently, a third of donor kidneys come from a living friend, relative or, much more rarely, a stranger in an ‘altruistic donation’. At any one time there are 5,600 patients on the waiting list for a new kidney. About 3,250 transplants are carried out each year.","Brian Blanchard faced a lifetime of dialysis after suffering from kidney failure .

"Team Nigella have refuted Charles Saatchi's damning claims that the pair betrayed Nigella's cancer-stricken first husband John Diamond by starting their relationship while he was still alive. However sources close to the TV chef have spoken out saying Nigella acted all along with John’s full support and blessing. 'When he knew he didn't have long left, he gave his tacit approval to Saatchi,' John's close friend tells the Sunday People. Nigella pictured with ex-husband John Diamond months before his passing . 'John himself sanctioned the relationship when he knew he was going to die. He was very keen on his young children having a father figure so actively encouraged Nigella to sate Saatchi.' Meanwhile Nigella's friends reject Saatchi's claim that their relationship was sexual before John's passing. Saatchi said on Friday: 'Nigella and I began our relationship . during the last six months of her husband John Diamond's life, rather . than after his death as she [Nigella] stated in court,' in what he described as 'clarification' in a statement that he volunteered to the Daily Mail. 'Looking back at that time, I very deeply regret that this . betrayal of John occurred.' The timing of this 'confession' infuriated Nigella's friends, who described it as a 'wicked attempt to . smear her'. They married in 2003, two years after the death from cancer of Nigella's journalist husband and Saatchi's Scrabble-playing friend, John Diamond. These new claims from Saatchi are barbed and potentially damaging to Nigella, and all are rebutted by her team. Nigella on the most recent episode of her new show The Taste . One says: 'Saatchi has been doing his worst for months to damage Nigella because he can't bear it that she walked out on him. Nobody walks out on Saatchi, do they? Why can't he just get on with his life and let her get on with hers?' Nigella testified in court that the relationship began after her husband's death. Saatchi and Diamond had met over gambling games of Scrabble above a restaurant in Knightsbridge and eventually the journalist brought Saatchi home to meet his wife. At the time Saatchi was still married to his second wife Kay, mother of his only child Phoebe, 19. One of Nigella's circle said Saatchi became a frequent visitor when Diamond was ill for four years - and that Nigella and Saatchi had got close by the time Diamond died. But they added that it was 'disgraceful' of Saatchi to say what he has. This took the form of allegations . involving, among other things, Nigella’s drug taking and the . ultra-delicate matter of when their relationship started — they married . in 2003, two years after the death from cancer of Nigella’s journalist . husband and Saatchi’s Scrabble-playing friend, John Diamond. Such is Saatchi’s apparent . determination to harm his third ex-wife that, astonishingly, he is . unconcerned that some of what he says contradicts the evidence he gave . in court during the Grillo sisters’ trial. For . example, at Isleworth Crown Court on November 29, he testified: ‘I have . never, never seen any evidence of Nigella taking any drugs whatsoever. I . want to be helpful, but I genuinely have no real knowledge at all.’ In . response to one question, he said: ‘Are you asking me whether I think . Nigella truly was off her head? Not for a second. Over this whole period . she was writing books very successfully and appearing on television . shows very successfully.’ Back to business: Nigella Lawson tests some a dish on the US version of her new reality TV series The Taste . Now . he says: ‘The truth is that she was taking illegal drugs secretly . throughout the last few years of our marriage, often with her own child . when she was far too young to even smoke or drink.’ Drug-taking, . he goes on, ‘took place at an alarmingly frequent rate. That this . practice seems to be considered acceptable behaviour in sections of the . Press is deeply disturbing, as is the notion that you can teach your . children that drugs are a justifiable way to make “an unbearable . situation bearable”.’ This . is a reference to Nigella’s evidence in which she said there had been a . point in her life with Saatchi when she used cannabis ‘to deal with a . summer of abuse’. In court Nigella admitted smoking cannabis in front of . the children. Asked if she smoked ‘with or in front of the children she . replied: ‘I’m afraid I did.’ She said she took cocaine on six occasions . to help with the stress of coping with her late husband’s terminal . cancer, and when subject to moments of Saatchi’s ‘intimate terrorism’ — a . phrase with special resonance for Saatchi, as we shall see. Allegations: Saatchi has told the Mail Nigella 'took illegal drugs secretly throughout the last few years of our marriage, often with her own child' So why is he stirring things up now, when he and Nigella are divorced, living new, separate lives, and the Grillo prosecution has been resolved? After all, most men aged 70, especially one who is successful and worth around £135 million, would be happy to see the back of an unsavoury episode which exposed the seediness at the heart of his opulent lifestyle. From a family point of view, it is . impossible to exaggerate the pain and unhappiness which this continued . state of war between him and Nigella is generating. Their children are . the most obvious victims of the collateral damage. Last . August, Phoebe was put on the telephone by her father so she could read . an emotional statement to the Mail, expressing her misery at having no . contact with Nigella who had been her virtual mother since she was . seven. Sources close to the . family say that Nigella and Phoebe did have some contact after the . parting, but sadly that has stopped and a present sent for Phoebe’s . birthday was politely returned. On . both sides, friends agree on one other point: what a sad situation it . is for this degrading soap opera to come between three youngsters who . grew up happily together from an early age. Saatchi . seemingly wants vengeance, though he doesn’t use the word. He claims he . has ‘no alternative’ to say what he’s saying because of the ‘inaccurate . allegations’ which Nigella ‘made up about me’ during last month’s court . hearing and in the media. ‘I no longer feel the need to cover up for her any more,’ he says. According . to friends, he is furious with Nigella for linking her drug-taking with . that vague but devastating phrase ‘intimate terrorism’, implying that . somehow it was his behaviour that drove her to drugs. He told a friend: ‘She’s saying  it was my fault she did drugs.  It wasn’t.’ The . friend adds: ‘He’s angry that he went into court first and spoke up for . her, but when it was her turn to give evidence she gave him  a . monstering. Previous marriage: Saatchi claims he and Nigella started their relationship in the last six months of her previous marriage to late journalist John Diamond - the two pictured together in 1999 . ‘Charlie also cannot forgive Nigella for not speaking out on his behalf over the choking business. She let him hang.’ Astonishingly, there are now no fewer than five offered explanations for the lunchtime episode at Scott’s restaurant. Explanation 1: When given a police caution for his action, Saatchi described the incident as nothing more than ‘a playful tiff’. Explanation . 2: He told the Grillo court: ‘I was not gripping, strangling or . throttling her. I was holding her head by the neck to make her focus. Can we be clear? Was it about her drugs use? No.’ Explanation . 3: Nigella, who had remained silent about the episode for five months — . infuriating Saatchi — until stepping into the witness box at the Grillo . trial, told the court that she had spotted a child in a pram and made a . comment about her excitement at the prospect of being a grandmother, at . which he grabbed her throat saying: ‘I’m the only person you should be . concerned with.’ Explanation . 4: Some of the pictures showed Saatchi looking in her nose, ostensibly . for cocaine. Nigella told the court: ‘This was a story he (Saatchi) made . up afterwards because I would not go back and clear his name.’ Explanation . 5: The row was over whether Nigella’s daughter should go to university — . Saatchi believed Mimi should go to university. Anger: According to friends, Saatchi - pictured with Nigella in happier times - is furious with his ex-wife for implying  his behaviour drove her to drugs . How the two must now wish the Grillo . sisters had never been prosecuted for fraud over their spending of . nearly £700,000 on a Saatchi private company credit card. Acquitted by a . jury, they promptly sold their story to a red-top newspaper. For . Saatchi and Nigella, the trial meant almost endless exposure and . embarrassment as their lives were laid bare in excruciating detail. So . whose idea was it to call in the police? According . to Saatchi it was Nigella’s decision, not his, to prosecute the Italian . sisters who worked for her for more than a decade. ‘Had it been my . choice there would have been no trial,’ he declares. ‘There . was no way for me to recoup the money they had spent, or the legal . bills and the many weeks required to quantify the damage and build the . case.’ Trial: Saatchi says it was Nigella's decision to prosecute the Grillo sisters - pictured on ITV's This Morning - leading to endless speculation about the pair's private lives . Nigella’s supporters point out that this claim directly contradicts his statement to the police in  January last year — it was read out in court — in which he says that ‘in light of [the Grillos’] behaviour  it would be better to instigate  proceedings against them’. On July 23, after talking to his accountant, Saatchi was quoted as saying: ‘I then decided that matters had reached a point where there was no alternative but to report the matter to the police.’ Saatchi decided to release his latest fusillade against Nigella  after she appeared on Good  Morning America, seen as her  first step towards regaining the public’s affection. Having declared war on her, Charles Saatchi is clearly refusing to end hostilities. Most people think it is a war he cannot win.","Nigella is back on the nation's screens for new show The Taste .

"He was loved for his delicate prints and colourful textiles but there was more to artist William Morris than a charming way with wallpaper. Indeed, as a groundbreaking new exhibition on the Pre-Raphaelite painter reveals, Morris was not only a socialist firebrand who almost single handedly sparked the arts and crafts movement, he also had decidedly risqué tastes in gardening implements. Included in Anarchy & Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy is a set of gardening tools created by sculptor Eric Gill which are guaranteed to raise an eyebrow or two. Risqué: Sculptor Eric Gill is behind this rather naughty garden roller which shows Adam and Eve . Based on the story of Adam and Eve, the roller created for Morris by Gill shows the biblical couple in a rather compromising position. Gill, now disgraced after being revealed to be both incestuous and overly fond of the family dog, was a friend of Morris' and shared his left-wing politics. But eye-opening though Gill's designs are, it is Morris who proved to be the most radical as the diaries and copy of Marx's Das Kapital included in the collection make plain. None of this comes as a surprise to curator and cultural historian Fiona MacCarthy, who says Morris believed that 'beauty was a basic human birthright' and as such, art should be available to everyone - including him. So, and in spite of his membership of the Socialist League, Morris wasn't immune to the odd vanity project, including encasing his copy of Das Kapital in gold. On display: Gill's roller takes pride of place in the National Portrait Gallery's new William Morris exhibition . Portrait of a painter: Morris pictured towards the end of his life in 1887 (left) and right, as a young man . 'Only William Morris would encase Karl Marx in a gold-tooled binding,' adds MacCarthy. 'It was part of his religion of nothing but the best – not for the elitist connoisseur but nothing but the best for the whole populace.' Despite his lofty ideals, much of Morris' work ended up on the walls of the Victorian elite, although his 'art for everyone' philosophy made him enormously popular. And that wasn't the only way in which he showed off his left-wing credentials. Like many other intellectuals of the time, Morris was fond of the mandal, an example of which is included in the exhibition. Dating from 1880, the sandals became popular in the UK following a visit to India by Morris' friend, philosopher Edward Carpenter. 'Carpenter was the man who introduced the sandal to left-wing circles,’ reveals MacCarthy. ‘They became a kind of cult among left-leaning middle-class intellectuals.' Family: Morris (top left) with his glamorous wife Janey (bottom right) and Sir Edward Burne-Jones (centre) Striking: Morris' beautiful wife Jane - or Janey as she was also known - regularly appeared in artworks . Pretty: William Morris is famous for his pretty garden-inspired wallpaper and textile designs . But the National Portrait Gallery exhibition, which opens this week, isn't only about Morris, his mandals and his risqué taste in gardening tools. Among the 140 artefacts to star in the exhibition is a beautiful portrait of Morris' wife Jane as well as a striking peacock brooch made as part of the arts and crafts craze sparked by Morris and his friends. Other highlights include striking pieces by Bernard Leach and Terence Conran, as well as furniture and jewellery that belonged to Morris himself. ‘In the 21st century, our art and design culture is widespread,' adds MacCarthy. 'But its global sophistication brings new anxieties. 'We find ourselves returning to many of Morris’s preoccupations with craft skills and the environment, with local sourcing, with vernacular traditions, with art as a vital force within society, binding together people of varying backgrounds and nationalities. 'This exhibition, as I see it, will not only explore what William Morris’s vision was but will suggest ways in which his radical thinking still affects the way we live our lives’.","Anarchy & Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy opens this week .

"Susan Sarandon may be a mother-of-three and new grandmother-of-one, but in a new interview she reveals she was told she would never be able to have children after being diagnosed with endometriosis. The actress, now 67, told Terri White, editor-in-chief of Time Out New York, that she had 'gone for years and years and years without using birth . control, with the explanation from these doctors.' And while the condition had not devastated her as it might another woman, she welcomed the opportunity when she became pregnant while dating Italian filmmaker Franco Amurri in 1984. Susan Sarandon, now a mother-of-three and new grandmother-of-one, has revealed she was once told she would never be able to have children . 'I was ready to do it on my own, even . though a lot of people counseled me against it - that it would be the end . of my career,' she said. 'It was just such a freak [thing] that I got pregnant that I . thought I can’t ignore this. And so I jumped. I had to pay . attention when it happened, because nobody could understand how it had . happened.' Ms Sarandon's daughter, Eva, was born in 1985 - the first of three children - she went on to have two sons (Jack, now 25, and Miles, now 22) with ex-husband Tim Robbins. New generation: Ms Sarandon pictured in February with daughter Eva Amurri, who welcomed a little girl of her own on Saturday . And just this weekend, her family welcomed one more member when Eva gave birth to a daughter of her own. Having a ball: Ms Sarandon guest-edited the new issue of Time Out New York . On the idea of becoming a grandmother, she admitted: 'I feel a little like I did when I was pregnant. You go about physically dealing with it and rationally dealing with it, but there’s some part of your brain that can’t wrap itself around this idea that your child, that your daughter, is going to have a daughter. I mean, it’s just so beautiful and huge.' Not that the actress will be a traditional grandmother. In addition to being rather more glamorous and famous than the average woman, she told People earlier this year that she would like her granddaughter to call her Honey. 'I borrowed this name from a very dear friend of mine who’s from the South, and his grandma was ""Honey,""' she said. 'That’s what I’m experimenting with, and Eva likes it, so we’ll see.' Ms Sarandon is now dating Jonathan Bricklin, 36, her co-investor in ping-pong bar Spin. She told Time Out of their relationship: I think the sexiest thing you can possibly do is to create with another person. And that doesn’t even mean there has to be sex involved. If I’m doing a film and it’s a collaborative situation that is rich and makes you think outside the box and surprises you, it’s just a wonderful planet to be on.'","The actress's eldest daughter, Eva Amurri, 29, welcomed a daughter on Saturday ."
"Dublin found itself at the centre of an Ebola scare after a woman was rushed to hospital displaying symptoms of the deadly disease and immediately placed in isolation. The patient, who had recently returned from West Africa, underwent tests at the Mater Hospital today and the Ebola virus has been ruled out. It is understood that the woman was admitted to the National Isolation Unit as a precaution after being considered 'a low risk for the Ebola Virus'. Gardai and ambulance crews shut down Berkley Road in Tyrrelstown, Dublin, in a suspected Ebola case . The Health Service Executive (HSE) said that it 'must, and does, take each Ebola scenario seriously no matter how low the risk.' 'All appropriate infection control procedures are being taken by all relevant healthcare personnel,' a statement from HSE added. The woman, who was taken ill at her flat in the Dublin suburb of Tyrrelstown, is believed to have recently returned from Nigeria, which was today declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organisation, having had no new cases for 42 days. HSE said that the patient is receiving appropriate treatment at the Mater Hospital and public health protocols have been, and are being, put in place. Witnesses reported that ambulance crew, and other staff wore protective gear throughout the investigation . The HSE in Ireland said that it 'must, and does, take each Ebola scenario seriously no matter how low the risk' Witnesses reported that ambulance crew, and other staff wore protective gear throughout the investigation. Large areas surrounding the hospital were shut down in accordance with procedures outlined by Health Minister Leo Varadkar, last week. The HSE statement said: 'There are no known cases of Ebola in Ireland presently', before adding that the 'overall risk of a case of Ebola being brought into in Ireland is low'. The road where the woman lived as well as large areas surrounding the hospital were shut down in accordance with procedures outlined by Health Minister Leo Varadkar . 'The HSE welcomes the fact that the WHO has removed Nigeria from the list of Ebola affected countries,' the statement continued. 'If a case is confirmed in Ireland, the primary concerns will be treatment of the patient and containing the situation.' Outside West Africa, the spread of the deadly disease has been confirmed in Spain and the United States. Possible cases have been investigated in several other countries, but none has yet turned out to be Ebola. HSE Ireland said that public health protocols have been, and are being, put in place . But in the three worst affected countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - 'new cases continue to explode in areas that looked like they were coming under control', WHO has said. 'An unusual characteristic of this epidemic is a persistent cyclical pattern of gradual dips in the number of new cases, followed by sudden flare-ups,' the organization added. Latest figures from WHO put the number of people infected with Ebola worldwide at over 9,000, with the death toll topping 4,500.

"Google's search boss believes the search engine of the future will be 'a perfect personal assistant' that can predict exactly what you want - and when you want it. He says the aim for the search giant is to create a world of 'knowledge on demand' - and admits the firm's work so far is just baby steps. Amit Singhal, 44, took over development of Google's search engine in 2000. 'I imagined a future where a starship computer would be able to answer any question I might ask, instantly,' Singhal said. Singhal is in charge of what Google calls its 'search algorithms', which decide how best to retrieve information and answer questions. His team tests thousands of search algorithms every year, adjusting, tweaking and inventing. The key is ranking information, giving the most pertinent answer first. The more Google keeps users happy, the better it is able to beat competition from Yahoo and other sites, and also draw lucrative advertisement to its pages. The search engine of the future will be the 'perfect personal assistant giving you benefit of all technical knowledge, enhancing your thought processes', Singhal told AFP in a rare interview. Singhal also dismissed criticism by some scientists that having all the information at people's fingertips could create lazy minds, shortening attention spans and reducing capacity to remember information. 'People always worry about change,' he said. 'We have to teach people to swim with the flow of technology, not swim against it,' he said. 'There were worries about the Gutenberg printing press that it would destroy the beauty of the spoken word, but we're far better off with the knowledge it's brought,' he said. 'People worried TV would stop people reading books but that hasn't happened,' he noted. 'The Internet has made people more productive removing barriers to getting information,' he said. Search is at the core of Google, which fields millions of questions a day in more than 110 languages. Singhal's vision has helped make it the most visited search engine globally, as well as one of the planet's most profitable companies. 'These are immensely exciting times' with search technology 'going through an exponential period' of change, he said. 'Ultimately I believe this will give mankind healthier, happier lives, not just through wearable technology, but the sum total of information that will be within our reach to improve lives.' When Singhal talks about his technological inspiration and the future of search engines, he smiles and says: 'Star Trek.' Singhal was in New Delhi to announce launch of Google's new Hindi-language content website. Nearly all of India's 198-million English speakers are already online and Google hopes the local-language website will add 300-million more Internet users. Singhal watched the popular science-fiction show obsessively growing up in India's Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. The series Singhal viewed repeats so often he knew the dialogue by heart gave him a dream about a future where a computer like the one on the starship Enterprise could provide any information immediately. And life has given Singhal, a graduate of the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology and Cornell University, the chance to help develop just that kind of technology. 'I imagined a future where a starship computer would be able to answer any question I might ask, instantly.' 'We're closer to that dream than I ever thought possible during my working life,' said Singhal, adding that he was 'blessed to do something I love'.

"Solar flares on the Sun can knock out power and affect communications on Earth. However, Nasa has spotted something far more dangerous - the strongest, hottest, and longest-lasting sequence of stellar flares ever seen from a nearby red dwarf star. The initial blast from this record-setting series of explosions was as much as 10,000 times more powerful than the largest solar flare ever recorded. Scroll down for video . The 'superflare' came from one of the stars in a close binary system known as DG Canum Venaticorum, or DG CVn for short, located about 60 light-years away. Both stars are dim red dwarfs with masses and sizes about one-third of our sun's. They orbit each other at about three times Earth's average distance from the sun, which is too close for Swift to determine which star erupted. At its peak, the flare reached temperatures of 360 million degrees Fahrenheit (200 million Celsius), more than 12 times hotter than the center of the sun. Stars erupt with flares for the same reason the sun does. Around active regions of the star's atmosphere, magnetic fields become twisted and distorted. Much like winding up a rubber band, these allow the fields to accumulate energy. Eventually a process called magnetic reconnection destabilizes the fields, resulting in the explosive release of the stored energy we see as a flare. The outburst emits radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to visible, ultraviolet and X-ray light. 'We used to think major flaring episodes from red dwarfs lasted no more than a day, but Swift detected at least seven powerful eruptions over a period of about two weeks,' said Stephen Drake, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who gave a presentation on the 'superflare' at the August meeting of the American Astronomical Society's High Energy Astrophysics Division. 'This was a very complex event.' At its peak, the flare reached temperatures of 360 million degrees Fahrenheit (200 million Celsius), more than 12 times hotter than the center of the sun. The 'superflare' came from one of the stars in a close binary system known as DG Canum Venaticorum, or DG CVn for short, located about 60 light-years away. Both stars are dim red dwarfs with masses and sizes about one-third of our sun's. They orbit each other at about three times Earth's average distance from the sun, which is too close for Swift to determine which star erupted. 'This system is poorly studied because it wasn't on our watch list of stars capable of producing large flares,' said Rachel Osten, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore and a deputy project scientist for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, now under construction. 'We had no idea DG CVn had this in it.' Most of the stars lying within about 100 light-years of the solar system are, like the sun, middle-aged. But a thousand or so young red dwarfs born elsewhere drift through this region, and these stars give astronomers their best opportunity for detailed study of the high-energy activity that typically accompanies stellar youth. Astronomers estimate DG CVn was born about 30 million years ago, which makes it less than 0.7 percent the age of the solar system. Stars erupt with flares for the same reason the sun does. Around active regions of the star's atmosphere, magnetic fields become twisted and distorted. Much like winding up a rubber band, these allow the fields to accumulate energy. Eventually a process called magnetic reconnection destabilizes the fields, resulting in the explosive release of the stored energy we see as a flare. The outburst emits radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to visible, ultraviolet and X-ray light. At 5:07 p.m. EDT on April 23, the rising tide of X-rays from DG CVn's superflare triggered Swift's Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). Within several seconds of detecting a strong burst of radiation, the BAT calculates an initial position, decides whether the activity merits investigation by other instruments and, if so, sends the position to the spacecraft. In this case, Swift turned to observe the source in greater detail, and, at the same time, notified astronomers around the globe that a powerful outburst was in progress. 'For about three minutes after the BAT trigger, the superflare's X-ray brightness was greater than the combined luminosity of both stars at all wavelengths under normal conditions,' noted Goddard's Adam Kowalski, who is leading a detailed study on the event. 'Flares this large from red dwarfs are exceedingly rare.' The star's brightness in visible and ultraviolet light, measured both by ground-based observatories and Swift's Optical/Ultraviolet Telescope, rose by 10 and 100 times, respectively. The initial flare's X-ray output, as measured by Swift's X-Ray Telescope, puts even the most intense solar activity recorded to shame. The largest solar explosions are classified as extraordinary, or X class, solar flares based on their X-ray emission. This 01 October, 2001 NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) EIT (Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope) image of the Sun shows a solar flare leaping out from an active sunspot (lower-R). The largest solar explosions are classified as extraordinary, or X class, solar flares based on their X-ray emission. 'The biggest flare we've ever seen from the sun occurred in November 2003 and is rated as X 45,' explained Drake. 'The flare on DG CVn, if viewed from a planet the same distance as Earth is from the sun, would have been roughly 10,000 times greater than this, with a rating of about X 100,000.' Three hours after the initial outburst, with X-rays on the downswing, the system exploded with another flare nearly as intense as the first. Over the next 11 days, Swift detected a series of successively weaker blasts. Osten compares the dwindling series of flares to the cascade of aftershocks following a major earthquake.","Initial blast from record-setting series of explosions was as much as 10,000 times more powerful than the largest solar flare ever recorded .
At its peak, the flare reached temperatures of 360 million degrees Fahrenheit (200 million Celsius), more than 12 times hotter than the center of the sun .
'Superflare' came from one of the stars in a close binary system known as DG Canum Venaticorum located about 60 light-years away."
"Noah Ritter became an internet sensation after an interview in which he just can't stop saying the word 'apparently' garnered more than 4.6million views on YouTube. But - apparently - the adorable five-year-old is not actually sure what his favorite word even means. In an interview with the Today show this morning, the Pottstown, Pennsylvania youngster earnestly admitted: 'No, I don't know how to spell ""apparently"". I don't know what it means, but I use it in, ""Wow, this is apparently annoying.""' Scroll down for video . Big word for a small boy: Overnight internet star Noah Ritter, five, has admitted that he's not actually sure what his favorite word, 'apparently', actually means . Enjoying his fifteen minutes of fame: When asked what it's been like to be an overnight star, he gushed rather eloquently: 'It's like being a thousand drops of heaven' What's more, he then informed the crew that he's just about ready to retire the word altogether. 'I'm tired of it,' he said while perched on a swing in his back yard. Still, there's no doubt that the confident redhead has thoroughly enjoyed his 15 minutes of fame. When asked what it's been like to be an overnight star, he gushed rather eloquently: 'It's like being a thousand drops of heaven.' In Noah's original live television interview, which appeared on WNEP TV on Friday, a newscaster is seen approaching him on the opening day of the Wayne County Fair in nearby Honesdale. While reporter Sofia Ojeda was seeking a verdict on the ride he had just been on with his grandfather, Noah had his own agenda. Exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently', he said: 'It was great and apparently I’ve never . been on live television but apparently sometimes I don’t watch the news . because I’m a kid and apparently every time Grandpa just gives me the . remote I have to watch the Powerball.' The preschooler was clearly excited to share his views, confidently holding the microphone and speaking in a somewhat newscaster-y voice. Still attempting to get her soundbite, Ms Ojeda asked again how Noah had enjoyed his ride, only to get more of his adorable perspective on life. Moment in the spotlight: Noah confidently held the microphone and spoke in a somewhat newscaster-y voice . Perk of the job: The clearly amused reporter, Sofia Ojeda, is just seen crouching down to speak at Noah's level, while a little girl tries to get her fifteen seconds of fame too . 'Well, it was great because apparently . you’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that’s . all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I’ve never ever been . on live television. I've never been on live television.' The amused reporter, who is seen crouching down to speak at his level, asks: 'Are you excited?' To which Noah replies: 'Yeah, and apparently I only went down the super slide. . . I was scared half to death. I just freak out.' Noah used the word 'apparently' no less than eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview, and repeated that he had never been on live television three times. Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, who had accompanied him to the fair, told ABC News: 'Noah is pretty talkative. He has a large vocabulary.' 'I'm a celebrity!': Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, says the youngster is enjoying his newfound fame . Star-in-the-making: Noah Ritter poses with his bicycle outside his home in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania . Apparently, he's now famous: Noah's performance has been watched over 4million times on YouTube . He added that the youngster appears to be enjoying his newfound fame. 'We were watching it on the computer and . it replayed on the local news,' Mr Borowski said. 'He’s going, ""That’s . me. I’m a celebrity.""' But for Noah, who is spending the summer with his grandfather, TV fame comes a lowly third place in his list of favorite things. Mr Borowski says his first loves are dinosaurs and swimming. 'We go down to the history museum in Philadelphia about once a month because he loves the dinosaurs,' he said. 'And we go for swim lessons every Saturday morning because he loves to swim.'

"Though he no longer works at Myspace, Tom Anderson, the co-founder of the website, has been keeping busy as a photographer. Under the username myspacetom on Instagram, Anderson has over 107,000 followers on the social media site. On Facebook, where he also posts many of his images, he has over 1.4million followers. His photographs, which show beaches, city skylines, animals, sunrises and sunsets - as well as world-famous monuments including the Taj Mahal - regularly receives thousands of likes. Anderson's smiling Instagram profile photo is the same one which appeared on many MySpace users' profiles. 'I started shooting at Burning Man,' Anderson told MailOnline in an email exchange. 'It's such a creative, wild environment. I can't think of a better place to begin an aesthetic life. Burning Man is like one big giant art installation in the middle of starkly beautiful desert landscape, and the attendees are creative in the way they dress. I began shooting there and was really happy with the results. I was immediately hooked.' Regarding his equipment, Anderson revealed he '[uses] Nikon DSLRs and [post-processes] mostly in Photoshop and Lightroom. When people see a shot they like, they often ask me about the gear. 'I can't stress enough how unimportant the camera really is. Any brand of camera will do. For 95% of my shots, the lowest end DSLR will be just fine. Expensive gear helps for night shots, but I wouldn't recommend beginners overspend on a camera. ' Keeping busy: Though he left MySpace, co-founder Tom Anderson has been travelling all over and taking photography. This image captures Glacier National Park . Majestic: Slot Canyon was captured in this September photo. On Facebook, where Anderson also posts many of his images, he has over 1.4million followers . Around the world: Anderson posted this image of Hong Kong on Instagram August 20. He currently has over 107,000 on the social media site . What a view! A nighttime scene at the Brooklyn Bridge was shared on March 5 this year . Starry night: The former face of MySpace captured Big Island in Hawaii and shared it on Instagram last August . When asked about what is the most difficult thing to photograph, Anderson said 'Cameras are still limited when shooting directly into the sun. I put a lot of work into ""rescuing"" a sunset photo with blown out highlights or dark shadows. It's often the prettiest time of the day, but the best camera gear still can't easily capture the dynamism of extreme light.' As for question of what he enjoys photographing the most, Anderson revealed 'I live in Hawaii part time and love shooting the ocean, both long exposures that capture the movement of water and with a fast shutter speed to freeze the power and force of a wave. 'I've not published many of these shots because they're hard to get right, and so many people do it better than me, but it's an awesome feeling to experience the wind, spray and crashing sound while shooting. It's one if the more visceral photographic experiences.' Anderson, who has visited multiple countries in his adventures, told MailOnline his reasoning for picking locales is relatively straightforward. 'Usually it's just from seeing photos of an awesome place,' he said. 'There's no real rhyme or reason to it, though I do try to go where the weather is likely to give me the conditions for a good shot. My friends are usually on a more restrictive schedule than me, so I may go where they want.' Keeping watch: Anderson himself is seen peering over a field during a trip from Taipei to Kenting . Change of season: Fall foliage in Oregon was posted to Instagram on April 22 this year. Anderson pursued photography after attending Burning Man in 2011 . Quiet moment: A monk sits cross-legged in Mae Jo, Thailand . Anderson said he is also surprised by the interest many have taken in his work. 'I remember when I posted the first shots 3 years ago and people were immediately supportive,' he told MailOnline. 'I didn't realize so many people were interested in learning photography, but I guess it's one of those hobbies that is growing exponentially due to quality cameras getting cheaper, and the Internet giving people a rewarding environment to share their work.' Anderson said he hopes to travel to 'Petra, Greece, Africa and Patagonia.' 'I haven't made any plans for Africa, but the other three will likely happen in the next six months,' he said.

"A Chinese social media user uploaded a picture showing a young man riding a motorcycle with no less than five passengers on the back. The 'six-person motorbike' was seen by a local man You Hou while he was driving down the streets of the city of Fuzhou in south-eastern China's Fujian Province. Posting the images he said: 'I was driving home from work with as friend when the motorcycle rode past. Crazy: A Chinese social media user uploaded this picture of a motorcycle with six people on it . 'The bike was going at 31 mph, but looked incredibly dangerous. 'The young man riding the bike was seated at the very front, with four other men and women sitting behind him, and the last person standing at the back. 'I know that there are some pretty unsafe vehicles on the road but I challenge anyone to come up with something like that, outside of a circus stunt riding team.' He was backed by other netizens, the name for the Chinese social media users, who not only slammed the bike riders for putting their lives and the lives of others at risk, but also criticised police who they said should have been looking out for such dangerous stunts. 'The bike was going at 31 mph, but looked incredibly dangerous,' said You Hou who was driving down the streets of the city of Fuzhou in south-eastern China's Fujian Province . One, WangHou05, wrote: 'I travel that route every day and there must be one hundred CCTV cameras up there. One wonders what they are for if it isn't to put a stop to people carrying out stunts like this?' Fatal road accidents are a serious problem in China, where the highway network and number of new drivers are expanding rapidly while traffic laws and safety are widely flouted. The ministry of transport says the number of road deaths in China fell from 104,000 in 2003 to 60,000 in 2012, or from about 300 fatalities a day to less than 200. A study published in 2011 by a group of Chinese and US researchers concluded, however, that the number of deadly accidents was two times higher than the police claimed.","Chinese man saw incredible spectacle in the city of Fuzhou .

"Supermarket giant Coles has again been caught out misleading customers over the freshness of its groceries. In commercials, aired in August and September, celebrity chef Curtis Stone makes reference to Tasmanian grown apples being fresh at Coles right now and suggests that you 'feed your family better, fresher, with spring fruit and veg from Coles.' Following a complaint that the advertising was misleading, an investigation by the Advertising Standards Board found the company had breached the food code. Scroll down for video . Tasmania pink lady apples (pictured) were the subject of an investigation by the Advertising Standards Board who deemed Coles were misleading in their advertising saying they were 'fresh' The commercials in questions, which aired in August and September, were with well known chef Curtis Stone making reference to Tasmanian grown apples being fresh at Coles right now and suggests that you 'feed your family better, fresher, with spring fruit and veg from Coles' A Tasmania viewer lodged the complaint with the board saying these comments made were wrong and impossible. 'I live in Tassie and my apple tree is dormant! These apples would have been in storage for MONTHS, they are not fresh,' he said. 'This ad is misleading and my wife would like a personal apology from Curtis (or cash).' Coles said it was satisfied that it wasn't in breach of the food code and that the advertisement was not misleading. The food giant said it sourced the bulk of its apples from Tasmania, and the pink lady variety featured in the advertisement were harvested this year in Tasmania in the last half of April. It says for ten months of the year they could choose to source apples from outside of Australia to fulfil demand but it chooses to only sell apples from local growers. 'Coles is able to continue to deliver a fresh apple outside of the harvesting period due to the availability of advanced cold storage facilities.' 'Cold storage facilities place apples in a controlled low temperature and reduced oxygen (no nitrogen is added) environment to preserve their freshness.' While Coles said it was satisfied that it wasn't in breach of the food code for its advertisement of pink lady apples, the Advertising Standards Board said it was in fact misleading . Coles says it is able to continue to deliver a fresh apple outside of the harvesting period due to the availability of advanced cold storage facilities . Coles said it considers apples can remain fresh, even if placed in cold storage because 'Freshness' is determined with regard to the quality. 'Coles' view that produce can remain 'fresh' despite storage is consistent with the Macquarie Dictionary, which defines 'fresh' as retaining the original properties unimpaired,' it said. The Board noted that whilst the use of the word ‘fresh’ in relation to apples is not misleading, the  reference to ‘Spring’ fruit  changes the context of the word ‘fresh’ to imply that the apples have been freshly picked during the Spring season ready for immediate sale. The Board also considered that the likely interpretation of the advertisement by the average consumer would be that the Tasmanian apples being promoted as fresh this Spring would have been freshly picked in recent weeks and not over 3 months ago. It also referred to another case of 'fresh' produce at Woolworths in 2012 where the company was not deemed to be misleading in using the word ‘fresh’  on the basis that Woolworths had stated they may use cold storage, not freezing. The Board noted that whilst the use of the word ‘fresh’ in relation to apples is not misleading, the reference to ‘Spring’ fruit changes the context of the word ‘fresh’ to imply that the apples have been freshly picked during the Spring season ready for immediate sale . The commercials, claiming Coles' pink lady apples were 'fresh' featured well known chef Curtis Stone (pictured) With all evidence presented, the board made a ruling that the advertisement was in fact misleading and that Coles had breached the food code. In response, Coles said it would not air the advertisement again. In 2012, a similar case was dismissed against Coles about its 'freshly baked' bread. A complaint was made by a customer that their 'fresh bread' was frozen in the middle when purchased, when the store had implied it was straight from the oven. They received a reply stating that Coles did freeze their bread but their definition of fresh included 'fresh and frozen'. The board considered that the advertisement was truthful and was not misleading or deceptive.","Supermarket giant caught misleading customers over 'freshness' of apples .

"When Ian Rogerson was given the shock news that his three-year-old son Jack had developed autism, he didn’t even flinch at the decision to quit his life as a high-flying radio personality to care for him. Almost immediately the up-and-coming star - who appeared as one-half of a successful Australian radio duo, based in Sydney, in the 1980s alongside Jonathan Coleman – made his mind up 15-years-ago that he and wife Nicole were going to fight to better their son’s health. Their story – which revolves around their eldest son's battle with autism- is one of thousands untold in the battle to overcome the condition and will be aired on ABC’s Australian Story tonight. Scroll down for video . Ian Rogerson, former Sydney radio personality, gave up his career to care for his Autistic son, Jack Rogerson, who is about to graduate from high school . Ian Rogerson and wife Nicole with son Jack (pictured left) he was diagnosed with autism at age three but has overcome the odds to graduate as one of the top of his class in high school . Ian Rogerson (pictured left) gave up a successful a career in radio when he found out his son Jack, developed autism. Rogerson was one-half of a successful Australian radio duo, in the 1980s alongside Jonathan Coleman 'Jono' (pictured right) The Sydney couple describe how they went from rock bottom sitting in their car after learning of Jack's condition, to watching their son graduate school as one of the top of his class this year. Ian Rogerson (pictured right) gave up his radio career for son Jack (pictured left) despite some saying he committed 'career suicide' ‘We got to one pediatrician and we’d been to see him a couple of times,’ Mr Rogerson said. ‘And on one of the visits – it was just a bit of a throw away, (the pediatrician said) ‘oh, he’s got autism.’ ‘It was one of those things – it really hit.’ He and wife Nicole remember the day vividly, shattered that a disease they thought they couldn’t fix was going to burden their ‘perfect child’ for the rest of his life. ‘It was raining,’ Nicole said, ‘and Jack was sitting in the back of the car oblivious making all those baby sounds and I think for about half an hour we thought it was the end of the earth.’ ‘And then we thought, well, bugger you let’s see what we can do about this.’ Prior to the diagnosis, Jack was born a healthy boy, the ‘perfect child’ his father described him, a quiet, well-behaved toddler who hardly made a peep at night and was a pleasure to take into public. But by age three, the Rogersons discovered Jack wasn’t growing into the same boy many of his peers around him were. He was becoming increasingly agitated by sound and light, showed little sign of emotion and displayed no affection. Jack was in the grip of a relatively unknown disease that changed the Rogerson's life dramatically. At three years old, Jack (pictured right) developed autism. Prior to the diagnosis, Jack was born a healthy boy, the ‘perfect child’ his father described him as . Ian Rogerson and wife Nicole (pictured) remember the day vividly Jack was diagnosed with autism, shattered that a disease they thought they couldn’t fix was going to burden their ‘perfect child’ for the rest of his life . Mr Rogerson was enjoying life as a successful media identity having carved out a partnership with Australian radio host Jonathan Coleman as 'Johno and Dano' in the 1980s. When he announced he was leaving the industry to care of his son, many coined it 'career suicide', but Mr Rogerson said the priority of his son's health was paramount and that was all that mattered. He subsequenlty ended his career in top-rating radio shows and a string of national television programs to better his son's health. 'It didn't really matter what I did, or what my job was - if something is wrong with your child, you need to fix,' he said. Mr Rogerson's story of how he and his wife Nicole turned Jack's life around, after enlisting the professionalism of pioneer autism researcher Elizabeth Watson, is remarkable. At his worst, Jack was hyperactive an inaudible child who could barely speak. ‘He would scream and tantrum. He was just in his own world,’ his father said. His mother said health professionals had written him off, and that there was little help available. But now 18, Jack has taken huge steps in his battle to beat autism, all thanks to his involvement in an early intervention program known as Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA). Happy Family : The Rogerson wouldn't have done things differently after Ian (pictured middle right) gave up his radio career to help look after son Jack when he developed autism at three years old . The turning point in Jack’s life came in 1999 when the Rogersons met Ms Watson, a speech pathologist and therapist pioneering the treatment which focuses on all areas of development including communication, play, self-help, fine and gross motor as well as academic skills. Ian Rogerson 'Dano (pictured right) and Jonathon 'Jono' Coleman (pictured left) were a popular Sydney radio team . It addressed Jack’s problematic behaviours' including tantrums, as well as some socially inappropriate behaviours. The program also helps children perform basic tasks such as tying shoelaces. But for many not as fortunate as Jack, the program is simply out of reach. Ongoing treatment requires a huge financial investment due to a lack of Government-funded support. About one in every 100 child’s family will experience autism and only children whose family can afford treatment make successful progress to beat it. Mr Rogerson said some people pay upward of of ‘$40,000 a year,’ for the ABA program, but for him it was worth every cent . 'I'm so glad we did...we've got such a beautiful child.' Mrs Rogerson said involvement such as the ABA shows what is possible with the help of early intervention for autism. 'Jack's progress shows what is possible,' mother Nicole, who is now CEO of Autism Awareness Australia, said. 'We know that kids in Australia, one in a hundred of them, have Autism Spectrum Disorder and the reality is the vast majority are not getting anywhere near best practice guidelines for treatment of Autism.' She said unless the government makes a genuine investment in this area, so many children are not going to reach their best outcome. 'And I think that's a tragedy.' The Australian Story: My Name Jack, will air on ABC at 8pm tonight.","Former Sydney radio personality, Ian Rogerson, decided to quit after his son Jack had developed autism .

"U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder got so upset about Republican investigation into Operation Fast and Furious that he vented to colleagues in 2011 about GOP congressional investigator Darrell Issa 'and his idiot cronies.' The angry remark appears in an email Holder sent to his top deputies at the Justice Department, calling out the chair of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The committee was then engaged in a full-court press to get to the bottom of Fast and Furious, an ill-fated program through which the DOJ's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) told U.S. gun dealers in border states to make illegal firearms sales in large numbers to buyers who planned to traffick them to Mexico. The Obama administration hoped to track the weapons to drug cartel kingpins, but 65 per cent of the 2,000 firearms involved were never recovered. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE EMAIL . 'ISSA AND HIS IDIOT CRONIES': The depths of outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder's hatred for Republican House oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa slipped out in an email just released . FAST AND FURIOUS AND DEADLY: 'Operation Fast and Furious' involved straw-buyers who sent 2,000 gus to Mexico with help from the ATF, which hoped to track the firearms to drug cartels – but failed . ISSA ON THE WARPATH: Rep. Darrell Issa (right) presides over the powerful House Oversight Committee, which has dragged Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) officials to Capitol Hill to account for the scandal . One was the murder weapon that killed U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry in December 2010. The Holder email was part of a massive document dump that the Justice Department released on Election Day as Americans were occupied with voting and watching, breath-bated, for results. Little media coverage attended the cache, which amounted to 64,280 pages. The DOJ had refused to turn over those documents, and more, since Issa's committee subpoenaed them in October 2011. Holder was later held in criminal Contempt of Congress for refusing, making him the only presidential cabinet member in U.S. history to wear that badge of dishonor. In the April 15, 2011 email, Holder was responding to threats from Issa's committee staffers that they would issue subpoenas to force gun dealers – Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) in government-speak – to tell what they knew. One FFL's attorney shared the back-and-forth with the Justice Department. Matthew Axelrod, then the Associate Deputy Attorney General in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,described the situation in an email whose subject line was 'Possible subpoena for cooperating FFL.' His attorney, Axelrod wrote, had 'told Issa’s staff that his client has a variety of concerns with testifying, including the fact that he is a witness in a criminal matter and concerns for his safety.' Committee staffers, he added, 'told him that it would be easier to keep this confidential if he was willing to come in for a voluntary interview. Counsel said that his client didn’t want to.' After Axelrod outlined the possibility that Issa might issue a subpoena forcing the gun dealer to testify, Holder's then-chief of staff Gary Grindler reached up the chain of command. 'This keeps escalating,' he emailed Holder. That's when his boss lost patience. 'Issa and his idiot cronies never gave a damn about this when all that was happening was that thousands of Mexicans were being killed with guns from our country,' he fumed in an email to Grindler, Deputy AG James Cole, and Cole's chief of staff Stuart Goldberg. 'All they want to do – in reality – is cripple ATF and suck up to the gun lobby. Politics at its worst – maybe the media will get it.' Fast and Furious weapons had already been turning up at the scenes of Mexican gun crimes before Terry, the border patrol agent, was murdered. REST IN PEACE: A Mexican national killed US Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry with a gun that the Obama administration's Justice Department allowed a straw-buyer to traffick south of the border . NO CHOICE: ATF agents leaned on gun dealers in the American southwest to sell guns illegally in order to supply hte Fast and Furious program with weapons that could be sent into Mexico . Issa's investigation has uncovered evidence that a year before Holder's angry email outburst, some in the ATF sought to use the Fast and Furious program to build a case for a new gun control measure known inside the government as 'Demand Letter 3.' That plan was drawn up in order to use sales records from Fast and Furious-related purchases of large numbers of so-called 'long guns' – rifles and shotguns designed to be fired while braced against the shooter's shoulder – to force gun dealers everywhere to report the details of more of their sales to the federal government. It was so named because it was the third proposed regulation of its kind, . In one July 14, 2010 email the Oversight Committee has released, ATF Field Operations Assistant Director Mark Chait asked Bill Newell, ATF's Phoenix Special Agent in Charge, for help leveraging data from Fast and Furious. 'Bill – can you see if these guns were all purchased from the same FFL and at one time?' he asked. 'We are looking at anecdotal cases to support a demand letter on long gun multiple sales.' The massive tranche of emails released Tuesday, while the news media's attention was fixed on election maps and poling-place results, were brought about by a series of events primed by a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Judicial Watch, the center-right watchdog group famous for wringing incriminating paperwork out of secretive bureaucracies. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the Holder email criticizing Rep. Issa. After the DOJ refused to comply with the FOIA request, a federal judge ordered the government to release a 'Vaughn Index,' a specialized inventory of all the documents it was withholding coupled with a rationale for each. Many of those reasons seemed specious to the judge, who then ordered a similar disclosure to Issa's committee. MAN IN CHARGE? Then-Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler was Holder's point man on the 'gun-walking' debacle . The Justice Department, which has not commented on the Election Day document dump, chose to voluntarily release everything on Tuesday rather than face a judge's order to do it on a slow news day. The flood of documents that reached Capitol Hill, the Oversight Committee claimed in a press release, 'is an admission that the Justice Department never had legitimate grounds to withhold these documents in the first place.' 'Approximately two-thirds of the universe of documents that the Justice Department withheld from Congress has now been shown to be well outside the scope of Executive Privilege.' Issa said in a statement that '[w]hen Eric Holder wants to know why he was the first Attorney General held in criminal contempt of Congress, he can read the judge’s order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and President Obama illegitimately and illegally withheld from Congress.' Holder tendered his resignation in late September but will stay on until the White House can pick a successor who passes muster in the U.S. Senate.

"A new map of the fault lines underneath Hollywood has revealed the major landmarks at risk if an earthquake hits Los Angeles. The new maps, the first issued by the California Geological Survey in almost 20 years, reveal a new path for a major fault line in the area. Hotels, schools and even a church are now right on the fault line, it reveals - with much of the area's Sunset Strip at risk. Scroll down for video . The new Hollywood fault line: The buildings now affected by the zone (shown in green) include landmarks such as the Capitol Records tower in Hollywood, the Mondrian, Chateau Marmont and Standard hotels in West Hollywood, elementary and high schools and the Church of Scientology Celebrity Center . The Hollywood Fault is within the central portion of the Santa Monica-Hollywood- Raymond Fault system, which is collectively part of a greater than 200-km long west-trending system of oblique, reverse and left-lateral faults that separate the province of California on the north, from the Peninsular Ranges on the south. The Hollywood Fault extends east-northeast for about 17 km through densely populated areas, including the cities of Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, and the community of Hollywood within the City of Los Angeles, trending eastward to the Los AngelesRiver Valley. The buildings now affected include landmarks such as the Capitol Records tower in Hollywood, the Mondrian, Chateau Marmont and Standard hotels in West Hollywood, three elementary schools, a performing arts college and Immaculate Heart High School and Middle School. A total of about 12,000 properties lie in the newly drawn fault zones, roughly 500 feet on each side of estimated fault lines. However, some believe the maps are wrong. Mike Reader, the CEO Group Delta consulting, has carried out test in the areas said to be in the fault line - and found nothing. 'The first site we investigated on the map does not have a fault on it,' he told MailOnline. He called for the maps to be delayed while more work is carried out on the exact location of the fault. 'The big question is, is the map right - and that's still an open question,' he claims. 'There is a possibility that the map could be approved with the wrong information. 'There is a very high degree of uncertainly over this. 'They need to withhold finalisation of the map until more information is available.' Reader said the map could even impact existing buildings, such as hotels, ability to expand or remodel. St. Stephen's Episcopal Church on Yucca street is, according to the new map, in the middle of a fault line. 'There's a lot of unanswered questions,' Jaime Edwards-Acton, senior pastor at St. Stephen's, told the LA Times. 'We have to figure out: Do we have to change anything?' The maps were released under the . authority of the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning (AP) Act that . was passed following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. The AP Act is a state law designed to reduce the hazard from surface fault rupture during an earthquake. The maps reveal the fault zones the Government says are most at risk. 'Earthquake . Fault Zones are regulatory zones that encompass surface traces of . active faults that have a potential for future surface fault rupture,' the California Geological Survey said. The Standard Hotel . Sunset Towers Hotel . Chateau Marmont Hotel . New developments will be restricted within the fault zones. Owners wanting to build would have to do underground seismic testing, which is the only definitive way to locate a fault. 'The principal traces of the Hollywood fault are recommended for zoning, as they are believed to be still active,' the report concluded. Public schools are already working on research to see how at risk they are. The Los Angeles Unified School District has begun an underground study to see whether the Hollywood fault runs underneath Atwater Avenue Elementary School, and in the past has demolished classroom buildings found to be on top of faults. The aftermath of the 1984 LA Earthquake: Experts say the fault zone may be larger than previously thought . A fault is a fracture in the crust of the earth along which rocks on one side have moved relative to those on the other side. Most faults are the result of repeated displacements over a long period of time. A fault trace is the line on the earth's surface defining the fault, which for zoning purposes is defined as one that has ruptured in the last 11,000 years. Surface rupture occurs when movement on a fault deep within the earth breaks through to the surface. Surface ruptures associated with the 1992 Landers Earthquake, in San Bernardino County, extended for 50 miles with displacements of an inch to 20 feet. Not all earthquakes result in surface rupture. The Loma Prieta Earthquake of 1989 caused major damage in the San Francisco Bay Area but the movement deep in the earth did not break through to the surface. Fault rupture almost always follows preexisting faults, which are zones of weakness. Rupture may occur suddenly during an earthquake or slowly in the form of fault creep. Sudden displacements are more damaging to structures because they are accompanied by shaking. The Hollywood Fault is located along the southern boundary of the Santa Monica Mountains, where Cretaceous granitic rocks; mainly quartz diorite, and Feliz biotite granodiorite, are unconformably overlain by folded and faulted early to middle Miocene Topanga group marine siltstones, sandstones, and basaltic volcanic rocks, and late Miocene Puente Formation marine sandstones, siltstones and shales. The Azusa Unified School District has also begun searching for the fault shown crossing the campus of Charles Lee Elementary School. However, some firms say the maps are wrong - and are causing a major problem. An earthquake fault line should not be drawn underneath Blvd6200, one of Hollywood’s largest residential and commercial projects, a lawyer for the developer claimed earlier this month. The lawyer, John M. Bowman, told the state Mining and Geology Board that the fault line drawn by the California Geological Survey 'is not clearly detectable … and therefore is not sufficiently well-defined to be included on the map.' Millennium Partners, which co-owns the Capitol Records building and is seeking to build two skyscrapers next to it, also says the state's fault map is wrong. Millennium's geologists have taken soil samples and plan to dig a trench. 'We are confident the trenching will corroborate our previous investigations and demonstrate conclusively that no active fault exists on our site,' Philip Aarons, one of the developers at Millennium Partners, said in a statement. Luxury hotels could also be hit, with the Mondrian, the Sunset Tower and the Standard all close to the fault.The Standard 'will take necessary precautions to ensure the safety of their guests, which could potentially include structural assessment or seismic investigation,' spokeswoman Kaitlin Kominsky told the LA Times.Representatives of the Sunset Tower and the Mondrian declined to comment.","Controversial new map is first to be published in almost two decades .

"Researchers behind a study of green coffee bean extract as a weight-loss supplement, which was praised by Dr Oz, have admitted the data was bogus. The scientists, Joe Vinson and Bryan Burnham, have since withdrawn the research paper that they were paid to write from the medical community. In a statement published last week, they said: 'The sponsors of the study cannot assure the validity of the data so we, Joe Vinson and Bryan Burnham, are retracting the paper.' Scroll down for video . Dr Mehmet Oz, surgeon and TV star, praised green coffee bean extract on his show in 2012 (pictured) - researchers behind a study of the extract, used in diet pills, admitted last week they could not prove the data . Dr Mehmet Oz, host of the Dr Oz Show, testifies at a Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Insurance Subcommittee hearing on Capitol Hill in June. He told the Senate hearing that he has never endorsed specific health supplements or received money from the sale of supplements . The study had extolled the benefits of green coffee bean extract in helping people lose weight without going on a diet or doing any exercise. However, federal regulators discovered that data, including weight measurements, appeared to have been tampered with, CBS reported. The study first appeared in the journal of Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy, back in 2012. Dr Mehmet Oz praised the weight-loss product on his widely-syndicated TV show in May 2012 - which helped one manufacturer flog half a million bottles. In June, Dr Oz appeared before the Senate's consumer protection panel and was scolded by Chairman Claire McCaskill for claims he made about weight-loss aids on The Dr Oz Show. The cardiothoracic surgeon, acknowledged that his language about green coffee and other supplements has been 'flowery' and promised to publish a list of specific products he thinks can help America shed pounds and get healthy - beyond eating less and moving more. On his show, he never endorsed specific companies or brands but more generally praised some health supplements as fat busters. Senator McCaskill took Oz to task for a 2012 show in which he proclaimed that green coffee bean extract was a 'magic weight loss cure for every body type'. 'I get that you do a lot of good on your show,' McCaskill told Oz, but 'I don't get why you need to say this stuff because you know it's not true.' Oz insisted he believes in the supplements he talks about on his show as short-term crutches and even has his family try them. Following Dr Oz's comments about green coffee, some manufacturers jumped on the marketing bandwagon and created dietary supplements . The cardiothoracic surgeon, acknowledged that his language about green coffee and other supplements has been 'flowery' on The Dr Oz Show (pictured) He said his job on the show is to be a 'cheerleader' for his audience, one who offers hope even if that means looking to alternative healing traditions and any evidence that might support them. But Oz did agree that there's no long-term miracle pill out there without diet and exercise. Within weeks of Oz's comments about green coffee - which refers to the unroasted seeds or beans of coffee - a Florida-based operation began marketing a dietary supplement called Pure Green Coffee, with claims that the chlorogenic acid found in the beans could help people lose 17 pounds and cut body fat by 16 per cent in 22 weeks. The company, according to federal regulators, featured footage from The Dr Oz Show to sell its supplement. Oz has no association with the company and received no money from sales. In May 2014, the Federal Trade Commission sued the sellers behind Pure Green Coffee and accused them of making bogus claims and deceiving consumers. Oz stressed during the hearing that he has never endorsed specific health supplements or received money from the sale of supplements. Nor has he allowed his image to be used in ads for supplements, he said. 'If you see my name, face or show in any type of ad, email or other circumstance,' Oz testified, 'it's illegal' - and not anything he has endorsed. He hasn't allowed his name to be associated with specific brands, he said, because of ethical concerns he has about doctors making endorsements of health products.","The scientists withdrew the research paper on green coffee bean extract saying that they could not 'assure the validity of the data'

"Mandi Knight, 46, was left with facial burns after accidentally splashing her pony's drinking water on herself after suspecting it had been tampered with . A woman has been left with horrific facial burns after being accidentally splashed by her pony's drinking water  which had been spiked with a corrosive substance. Mandi Knight, 46, accidentally splashed the water on herself as she moved the bucket of drinking water out of her pony's way at a livery yard in St Austell, Cornwall, after realising it was fizzing and had clouded over. The mother-of-two had to be treated for 'excruciating' chemical burns after the substance – which was later identified by police as sodium hydroxide – caused her face to break out in ulcers and blisters. Ms Knight believes her four-year-old pony Lolly's drinking water was targeted on purpose, after police confirmed it tested positive for the chemical, which is also known as caustic soda and is mainly used in industrial detergents and drain cleaners. The highly corrosive substance can cause nausea, vomiting, blindness, stomach cramps and even death if ingested. Ms Knight said her pony would have been horrifically burnt from the inside out had she ingested the harmful substance, but said the animal didn't consume any because workers were alerted in good time. She said staff noticed the water when the animal started kicking its water bucket and, after contacting Ms Knight, called police to report the 'cloudy, frothing solution'. Ms Knight said: 'I went to have a look and we noticed the water was cloudy with a lump of something like wallpaper paste at the bottom and it stank like an engine. 'There was a massive great lump of white stuff in the bucket which we believe was caustic soda. 'I picked the bucket up and didn't realise how heavy it was and some of the water splashed on my face. 'It immediately started to burn. The doctor said it was a chemical burn. They treated it with liquid paraffin and told me to put Vaseline on it. 'It was very painful. It felt like a bad case of sunburn. We poured some of it onto the grass and it scorched it. If lolly had swallowed it she would have died. 'It would have ulcerated her mouth and she would have burnt from the inside out. 'Lolly was so clever to know something was wrong with the water.' The 46-year-old mother of two said she suspected the water had been targeted after it clouded over and started fizzing. A white lump of water could also be seen at the bottom of the bucket containing the water . Ms Knight poured the water on a patch of grass to see if it was harmful and the corrosive substance immediately scorched the turf. Police said it tested positive for sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda . Police believe the pony's drinking water was targeted by the same culprit who stole a riding saddle from Ms Knight's shed overnight between October 14 and 15. Ms Knight is now urging other horse owners to be vigilant to signs of tampering. Sodium hydroxide, which is also known as caustic soda, is a chemical substance commonly used in detergents and drain cleaners. It is white, highly soluble in water, and is sold in the form of pellets, flakes and granules, as well as in solution. If ingested, the substance can cause nausea, vomiting, blindness, stomach cramps and even death. It is highly corrosive and can cause serious burns, redness, swelling and blindness, if put topically on the skin. Those who come into contact with the substance should wash the contaminated area with large amounts of water and seek urgent medical attention immediately. She said: 'It is a concern because a lot of children use the field where it happened. Other horse owners need to extra cautious concerning water. 'They need to look for a white lump like wallpaper paste which smells like an engine. Don't touch it unless you are wearing gloves as it burns. 'I would ask whoever has done this to stop wrecking ponies' lives.' Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed it was investigating the incident, as well as the alleged burglary. A spokesman said: 'Officers are investigating a report of a burglary and also suspicious circumstances of a bucket of corrosive liquid being found in the area. 'The burglary occurred sometime overnight between Tuesday 14 and Wednesday 15 October when entry was gained to a tack room and equestrian items stolen. 'A black bucket was also found in the area which is believed to have contained an unknown corrosive clear liquid. Some of this liquid may have been put into the horse's drinking water.

"More than 64,000 pages of sensitive documents about the botched 'Fast and Furious' gun trafficking operation have been dumped on Congress following a court order that demanded their release. The Justice Department handed 64,280 pages of documents to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee yesterday as it relented in its two-year battle to keep the information secret. Documents in the 'election eve dump' relate to the notorious 'Fast and Furious' Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives (ATF) sting, in which Arizona field officers attempted to  track 2,000 illegally sold weapons across the border in the hope they would lead to arrests within the powerful Mexican drug cartels. In 2012, Attorney General Eric Holder (pictured left) was found in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over the documents. President Obama had claimed the documents should not be handed over under grounds of 'executive privilege' While straw buyers were arrested, many weapons remain unaccounted for. Most notably, two of the guns were found at a crime scene just north of Mexico where U.S. border agent Brian Terry was gunned down by illegal immigrants in December 2010. Republicans have now claimed the documents release is an admission by the Obama government that it had overstepped its legal boundaries, after failing to withhold them under executive privilege grounds. Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the reform committee, said: 'When Eric Holder wants to know why he was the first Attorney General held in criminal contempt of Congress, he can read the judge’s order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and President Obama illegitimately and illegally withheld from Congress.' Although concerned about redactions within the files, he called it 'a victory for the legislative branch, a victory for transparency, and a victory for efforts to check executive branch power'. But Brian Fallon, a Justice Department spokesman, told the Washington Times the release was part of a compromise it had long been attempting to reach with Congress. He said: 'We have long been willing to provide many of these materials voluntarily in order to resolve this matter outside of court, and believe that producing them now should bring us a big step closer to concluding this litigation once and for all.' Republican Darrell Issa (pictured) said Obama and Holder 'illegitimately and illegally withheld' the documents . Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry (pictured) was killed during an attack on him and three colleagues in 2010. Two rifles found at the scene were later revealed to have been tracked as part of Operation Fast and Furious . Border agent Mr Terry was killed when he and three other agents came under attack in a canyon north of the Arizona border by five gang members. Two rifles found at the scene of the shooting were later discovered to be tracked by the ATF. They were purchased by a straw buyer for smuggling to a Mexican drugs cartel - revelations that led to a political furore in Washington. Authorities declined to say whether the murder weapon in Mr Terry's death was linked to a purchase from the operation.","Justice Department releases more than 64,000 pages of documents .

"Standing on the bridge of the mighty HMS Queen Elizabeth, it is the sheer scale of the largest warship in Royal Navy history that hits you. This hi-tech batcave commands a view that runs for miles from Rosyth, Fife, beyond the seemingly endless flight deck of our newest aircraft carrier and taking in the Forth Bridges and a hazy Edinburgh city centre to the east to the Grangemouth refinery and the Ochils in the west. And yet, given that this is Britain’s biggest engineering project, one has to fight hard not to laugh out loud at the comical size of the ship’s tiny steering wheel. Scroll down for video . Workers put finishing touches to the carrier which should be fully operational by the end of the decade . It is odd to think that this plastic control, that could easily have come from a service-station arcade game, will one day steer a ship powered by two 33-ton propellers, each almost twice the height of a double decker bus. It is the only small thing about the first of the two new QE Class carriers to come on stream. Far below the bridge, a veritable army of workers in overalls and hard hats scurry purposefully around this slumbering giant like ants, moving scaffolding, planks, screws, nails, piping and cabling. In a project fraught with delay and political wrangling, billions of taxpayers’ pounds, 80,000 tons of steel, 3.4million yards of cabling and 90,000 pipe spools have been used as proof that, for the time being at least, Britain can still do shipbuilding. Small wonder: One has to fight hard not to laugh out loud at the comical size of the ship's tiny steering wheel. The carrier will finally take to the water next month after her royal namesake travels north for her naming ceremony. By the end of the decade, she should be fully operational and equipped with 36  F-35B Lightning fighter-bombers. But, just 16 days before the Queen arrives to break a bottle of champagne against her bulbous bow, a tour of the Rosyth yard reveals a clattering, yammering wall of noise as 1,400 on-site workers weld, fit and hammer around the clock to get the new flagship ready in time. From the very first glimpse of her, rising up from a high security dry dock at Rosyth like some monstrous CGI creation from a Hollywood blockbuster, everything about her feels vast. Making waves: The carrier's bulbous bow shape helps the ship to cut through the water . From the keel to the masthead, she stands as tall as Niagara Falls. A phalanx of painters are in the process of applying seven coats of battleship grey paint over an area the size of Hyde Park. The flight deck measures 306 yards long by 76 yards wide – three times the size of its predecessor HMS Illustrious and as big as four full-size football pitches. This four-acre flatland is punctuated only by the ‘ski-jump’ take-off ramp and two 650-ton towers, or ‘islands’ (forward for the ship’s command-and-control, aft for air-traffic control). Standing on the deck yesterday on a sunny June day, the heat was already quite unbearable. It made one wonder what serving on operations in the sweltering Gulf might feel like. Queen-size: Size of the new Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carrier if it was on the River Thames . One deck down, the heat subsided slightly in the gigantic hangar space, which will be home to an assortment of aircraft, with F35Bs eventually parked up next to Merlin Mk2 helicopters, with capacity for Merlin Mk4s, Apaches, Wildcats and Chinooks. Aircraft can transfer to the flight deck via a huge lifting platform within 60 seconds. Missiles and bombs will be supplied directly to the flight deck from the reinforced armoury by 26 robotic ‘moles’. The ship is the first of the new breed of QE-class carriers and was originally intended to enter service in 2017, with a sister  vessel, the Prince of Wales, joining her by 2020. Nearly finished: Construction continues on the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier being built in Rosyth . The price of the carriers has soared to £5.3billion – nearly £2billion over-budget – and next year’s Strategic Defence Review will decide whether we keep both or sell the Prince of Wales to recoup some of the costs. Six UK yards, including BAE Systems on the Clyde, have fabricated parts of the vessel, with each piece slotted into place at Rosyth. Some staff have stayed with the build even after their sections were delivered. John McLaughlin, a foreman at BAe Systems, said: ‘I have been commuting to Rosyth from Glasgow for three years now and will be staying until the end. ‘It will be quite emotional when she finally goes out to sea. It’s been a lot of my life and it makes me very proud to be British.’","HMS Queen Elizabeth is Britain's biggest engineering project .

Angus Sinclair, 69, is accused of raping and killing Christine Eadie and Helen Scott, both 17, after they left the World’s End pub in Edinburgh. The murders are alleged to have been committed some time after October 15, 1977, when the teenagers were last seen leaving the bar on the capital’s Royal Mile at closing time. Deaths: Angus Sinclair, 69, is accused of raping and killing Christine Eadie (left) and Helen Scott (right), both 17 . Harrowing pictures of the two women’s bound and badly beaten bodies were shown to the jury at the High Court in Livingston yesterday. The court was told the friends were gagged, tied up, raped and strangled with items of their own clothing. Their bodies were found six miles apart on the morning of October 16, 1977, in East Lothian. Miss Eadie’s body was found in an area of ground near the foreshore at Gosford Bay while Miss Scott’s was discovered in a farmer’s field near Haddington. Sinclair is alleged to have killed the teenagers while acting along with his brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton, who is now dead. Yesterday, only days short of the anniversary of the murders, jurors viewed distressing images of the bodies and were taken through details of their injuries. Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland, QC, prosecuting, suggested family members might wish to leave before the images were presented to the court. But trial judge Lord Matthews said that it would not be fair to ask relatives of the two girls to leave if they wished to hear the evidence, and they agreed that the images would be shown to the jury but not put up on video screens on either side of the court visible to the public. The Lord Advocate warned jurors the images would be ‘upsetting and disturbing’ and many among the nine women and six men were clearly moved. The first day was taken up entirely with photographic evidence, the jury viewing the upsetting images of the bodies and the ligatures allegedly used to strangle them. One showed a ligature made from a denim-style belt and a pair of reddish tights, which was found around the neck of Miss Scott. A pink bra shown in another image had been used as a ligature around the neck of Miss Eadie. Location: Sinclair is accused of murdering the girls after they left the World’s End pub (pictured) in Edinburgh . A former police photographer, Alastair Calderwood, 48, was shown a piece of paper recovered from the right hand pocket of Miss Scott’s coat. He agreed with Mr Mulholland that it seemed to be a shopping list. The Lord Advocate said: ‘The writing appears to be a list of messages, or foodstuffs, to get from the grocers. An orange, two sausage rolls, milk…’ ‘Yes,’ said Mr Calderwood. The trial was also shown photographs of a white Morris Marina with the registration number PUN341S, the rear of which appeared to have been converted into a kitchen and living area, with a cooker, shelving and curtains in the windows. Earlier, the jury was shown where the bodies of the teen-agers were found. Retired police map maker Thomas Graveson, 66, said he had marked two sites in East Lothian where the bodies were discovered. He told the court Miss Eadie was found in a field near Gosford House beside the A198 road leading from Gosford Sands. Miss Scott was in another field, part of Coates Farm, near a bend on the road between the villages of Coates and Huntington. Under cross-examination by defence counsel Ian Duguid, QC, Mr Graveson accepted the maps were recent and showed what the area looked like today, rather than in 1977. Sinclair pleads not guilty to murdering both girls after raping and strangling them while acting along with his late brother-in-law Gordon Hamilton on October 15 and 16, 1977. Sinclair, whose address was given as a prisoner at Glenochil Prison, has lodged three special defences, of incrimination, consent and alibi. He claims that Hamilton committed the murders, that if there was any sexual contact it was with the consent of both females, and that he was fishing to the east of Cockenzie Power Station at the time of the offences. Judge Lord Matthews warned the jury they should not discuss the case with friends or relatives. He also said there could be serious consequences if they did their own research on the internet or asked questions on social media sites. He told them: ‘It’s important to base your verdict on the evidence you heard in court and not on anything else.’ He said the case was expected to last two to three weeks.

"A British mother is fighting for her life after falling 30ft onto a concrete ledge during a romantic trip to the Italian city of Pisa. Rommily Gill was rushed to hospital after plummeting from a walkway next to the River Arno in front of her horrified boyfriend. It is understood the 33-year-old suffered multiple fractures in the accident, at around 3.30am on Sunday morning, after losing her balance. Rommily Gill is fighting for her life after falling 30ft onto a concrete ledge during a romantic trip to the Italian city of Pisa with her boyfriend (both pictured) Italian police say that Miss Gill, from Dunoon, Argyll, and boyfriend Derek Cooper had spent the evening in the medieval city centre. Passers-by called the emergency  services after finding Mr Cooper in a distressed state at the roadside. Firefighters had to hoist his girlfriend, who runs her own company making designer handbags, on a stretcher back up to street level. Rommily Gill suffered multiple fractures in the accident, at around 3.30am on Sunday morning, after losing her balance while next to the River Arno . An ambulance then took her to the city’s Cisanello hospital where she remains in a coma. Her condition yesterday was described as ‘critical’. Police said that the couple had been staying at the Hotel Cecile in the city centre for a romantic mini-break. Hotel staff said that Mr Cooper was keeping a vigil by his girlfriend’s hospital bed. Other family members were due to arrive last night. Meanwhile, police launched an investigation to establish why Miss Gill fell. Francesco Tagliente, the prefect of Pisa, said officers were investigating ‘in particular whether beer, wine or other alcoholic drinks had been sold between 12.30am and 3.30am to people who were already obviously in a state of intoxication, in violation of the penal code’. Mr Tagliente said the couple had spent the evening drinking in various bars. ‘They were staying at the  Hotel Cecile for a romantic trip. Unfortunately it has ended badly,’ he said. ‘They went out on Saturday night, so there was quite a lively scene. They went to a few pubs, and parties. ‘They had some drinks and then somehow on the way home she slipped and fell from the parapet alongside the Arno onto a  concrete boardwalk.’ Police said that the couple had been staying at the Hotel Cecile (pictured)  in the city centre for a romantic mini-break. Hotel staff said that Mr Cooper was keeping a vigil by his girlfriend¿s hospital bed. Other family members were due to arrive last night . There have been several similar incidents in recent years, prompting authorities to put up warning signs in several European languages. Recently, Miss Gill, who is believed to have a three-year-old son, had started her own business, calling herself Romster and making ‘funky bags and purses in vintage and retro prints’. She is a regular stallholder at craft fairs held in the Merchant Square in Glasgow’s Merchant City. On her Facebook page,  she says: ‘Working from my sweatshop based in Dunoon, I make quirky bags & purses and some Jewellery too! ‘Each thing I make is always a little bit different, so each one is a one-off, made with love, sweat and occasionally a few tears (pin jabs hurt!)’ On her Twitter feed, she styles herself ‘Single Mum & Bad Ass. Dunoon.’ Her most recent post on Facebook was last Thursday when she changed her cover photo. Last night, a friend, Laura Turner-Sattele, who appears on Miss Gill’s Facebook page modelling her handbags, said that she was shocked by what happened. She added: ‘Rommily is a really good mother and really creative. She has not had any problems with drink or drugs. I have not heard from her in a while.’","Rommily Gill, 33, Dunoon, Argyll, suffered multiple fractures in the accident .

"Women look set to be welcomed into the world’s most exclusive golf club, ending its men-only status after 260 years. The hugely powerful Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, which also serves as the sport’s governing body, has written to all 2,500 of its current members recommending they agree to allow women to join. St Andrews has repeatedly resisted mounting political and commercial pressure to overhaul the admissions policy at its clubhouse, which overlooks the 18th green of the Old Course – the spiritual home of golf. St Andrews has repeatedly resisted mounting political and commercial pressure to overhaul the admissions policy at its clubhouse, which overlooks the 18th green of the Old Course, the spiritual home of golf . But in an extraordinary volte-face, Wilson Sibbet, chairman of the club’s influential General Committee, has written to members with a clear message that they should accept the change as inevitable. He writes that ‘now is the time to ask members of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club to welcome female members into the club.’ The letter continues: ‘It is of course for members to decide if they wish to alter the rules of the club to give effect to this change of policy. The General Committee sincerely hopes that this rules change will be enthusiastically supported.’ The unexpected development is likely to generate enormous international interest because the R&A acts as the rule-making body of golf. The letter will be posted this week to members, including James Bond star and keen golfer Sir Sean Connery, three-times Open winner Jack Nicklaus, and Herbert Kohler, the American tycoon and owner of the Old Course Hotel.

There will be a discussion at the club’s spring meeting about letting women members in, followed by a vote in the autumn. Women were denied membership in a previous vote, but it is hoped pressure from the top of the club will result in a different outcome this time. The move follows outrage levelled at the R&A for allowing clubs hosting the Open Championship to continue to exclude women. Last summer, trouble flared after Muirfield near Edinburgh, which operates a male-only policy, staged the tournament. First Minister Alex Salmond refused to attend. The furore prompted the R&A’s chief executive Peter Dawson to speak about a ‘direction of travel’ leading the game away from the practice of excluding women. In January, a major sponsor of the Open heaped further pressure on the governing body, saying it wanted the problem of men-only institutions hosting the championship ‘solved’ so that it did not have to ‘justify’ its financial support for the tournament. Giles Morgan, head of sponsorship at HSBC, said: ‘I think things are moving. It’s not something we are going to put a gun to anyone’s head over, but we would like to see it solved so we don’t keep talking about it.’","Clubhouse repeatedly resisted pressure to overhaul admissions .

"A 25-year-old has been arrested in connection with the death of Hazel North, 19 . A man has appeared in court today in connection with a missing teenager’s death. Hazel North, 19, from Dunfermline in Fife, Scotland, was last in contact with her family three weeks ago. The man who has been charged with is Miss North’s boyfriend, John Davis, 25. He has been charged with assault, assault to severe injury, murder and attempting to pervert the course of justice. He entered no plea and will be remanded in custody. Police confirmed they arrested a 25-year-old man last night following the discovery of a woman’s body in a park 60 miles away in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that a 25-year-old man has been arrested and is presently detained in police custody in connection with her death. A report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.'

Officers uncovered the body of a young woman after sealing off an area of Dean Park in Kilmarnock during the hunt for the teenager. The grim discovery comes just two days after officers searched the house and garden of an address in the Ayrshire town occupied by Mr Davis. Forensic experts worked at the property on Northcraig Road, which lies two streets away from the spot where Miss North’s remains were located early  yesterday morning. Police said yesterday that they believe the human remains found in a park are those of Ms North .

One said at the time: ‘The whole area is sealed off and there are police officers at every corner stopping you from getting anywhere near. There is a lot of thick undergrowth in that area.’ Leslie Gordon-Grant, 71, who lives opposite the area said: ‘This is absolutely tragic. I have never seen a search on this scale before. ‘It is usually a very quiet and lovely area.

"It is the greatest show in golf – and by the time the Ryder Cup gets into full swing this week, Gleneagles will have spent 13 years and £20million on staging its finest hour. As the eyes of the sporting world fix firmly on this jewel of the Perthshire countryside, experts predict a flood of golf-mad tourists will pump more than £100million into the national economy as they flock to watch the world’s top golfers do battle. Residents in nearby Auchterarder are determined to get their slice of the action when 250,000 fans arrive for the biennial clash between Europe and the US. Over here: The American Ryder Cup team arriving at Edinburgh Airport yesterday before heading to Gleneagles . Hotels and guest houses for miles around have long since booked out, while many enterprising locals have rented out their homes for five-figure sums. Even a week’s stay in a caravan park could set visitors back £1,400. Yet, as the first fans descend by bus and train at the PGA Centenary Course today for the first of the main practice rounds, police and locals are bracing themselves for possible travel chaos as roads surrounding Gleneagles are subject to a major programme of closures and restrictions. About 45,000 spectators are expected every day as US captain Tom Watson’s stars take on Paul McGinley’s European team this weekend. The event will put Scotland in the world’s shop window, as an estimated 500million viewers in 183 countries watch on TV. Champagne and the finest Scottish produce will be on sale at the huge temporary hospitality village that has grown up at the entrance to the PGA Centenary Course. Head start: No need to ask which team golfer Rickie Fowler will be playing for . With golf tourism already worth £220million annually to the Scots economy and supporting 4,400 jobs, hosting the 40th Ryder Cup is expected to make 2014 a bumper year for the home of golf. Although the course is only a short drive from Auchterarder’s High Street – the 1½-mile main thoroughfare which gives the Lang Toun its nickname – the event has been secured behind a ring of steel fences. Some retailers fear the tight travel restrictions which will see most spectators bussed straight to the course may mean their shops and cafes are bypassed. Heather Edment, golf business manager at Gleneagles Hotel, admitted the Ryder Cup had raised mixed emotions among locals: ‘Some people will be very happy because their local shops and restaurants will be busy. But others may feel that our quiet little town has been taken over.’ The busy A9 has been reduced to a single lane in each direction, with the inside lane part of an extensive park-and-ride scheme. Police have urged motorists to consider avoiding the area to reduce the inevitable delays. Residents have at least been spared a controversial parking ban in the centre of Auchterarder, after Perth and Kinross Council accepted at the last minute that it was unnecessary – although the traffic order will remain active and can be implemented if required. Ryder Cup Europe operations director Antonia Beggs said: ‘Although there will be many benefits to staging the 2014 Ryder Cup in Scotland, particularly for the Perthshire region, putting on a sporting event of this scale, with 45,000 people expected each day, will inevitably mean some inconvenience to local residents.’ While Gleneagles Hotel’s 232 rooms, including 26 luxury suites, have been reserved for the two teams, match officials and dignitaries, hundreds of enterprising locals have decided to give the travel chaos a miss and make a killing by renting out their homes – ranging from small flats to lavish family mansions – through estate agents and specialist golf websites. Child’s play: Youngsters at the Ryder Cup fan zone in Edinburgh yesterday as the first day begins . All smiles: US golfstar Phil Mickelson and his wife Amy arrive at Edinburgh airport ahead of the Ryder Cup . One four-bed room detached villa, situated in a typical middle-class estate but within walking distance of the course, was snapped up last year for £27,500 for a single week. Other rental businesses are also set to cash in. William Stewart, owner of Grand Eagles caravan park, has leased or sold 30 luxury lodges in the run-up to the tournament. He said that lodges that used to cost £650-£950 per week to rent have now rocketed ten-fold. Mr Stewart is currently charging £195 a night to park a caravan, compared to only £19.50 a year ago. He said: ‘We have 30 lodges here but we’re looking to build another 29. ‘We have been fully booked since March. People are coming from Germany and America. I’m not surprised at all the interest. Everybody’s desperate to be part of a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Hail to the chief: Tom Watson and wife Hilary arrived with the rest of the team ahead of the games . ‘We’ve actually sold 14 lodges so far this year, compared to six or seven last year. People are buying them and renting them out themselves for the Ryder Cup.’ Golf fans lucky enough to have secured a ticket have been warned that there is no ‘walk-on’ access to the course and that everyone – even those staying locally – will be required to use the shuttle buses and park-and-ride schemes which have been set up to minimise disruption to locals. Those arriving by train will be able to make use of a temporary bridge that will straddle the A9 and take fans straight to the site. Not everyone is up for a golf extravaganza . On the streets of Auchterarder, which borders the Gleneagles Hotel and golf courses, there are mixed feelings about the Ryder Cup. Frank Bradley, 35, owner of café Delivino, fears the promised tourism bonanza may fail to materialise as most golf fans will be bussed straight to the course and bypass the Perthshire town. He said: ‘I’m slightly worried people will go into Gleneagles and that will be them there all day. ‘However, I’m expecting a good influx of tourists and I’ve doubled the number of staff for this week.’ Danielle Polley, 22, who works at the Ellie’s Cellar off licence, said it had laid on a special free delivery service to local addresses until the Ryder Cup finishes on Sunday. Welcome: But how many golf fans will actually visit Auchterarder this week? Residents are worried it could fail . She added: ‘We’ve dropped them at holiday lodges and taken quite large deliveries. We’ve never done it before but a lot of people have relatives staying for the golf – so there’s a market for it.’ Paul Jackson, who has been the manager of Simon Howie Butchers for ten years, said: ‘We’ve seen a steady increase in business and in the last three weeks it’s gone up by 25 per cent. It’s great for the town because although Gleneagles is on the map, Auchterarder isn’t.’ Local shoe shop owner Eleanor Aitken said: ‘The school has benefited because the team captains have been down and handed out some tickets to the pupils. Businesses have a lot to offer here, so it’s a shame they’re being bussed in and away again.’ Another resident, who owns a fast food outlet but declined to give her name, also fears the tourist boost has been exaggerated. She said: ‘We’ve had extra trade from workers at Gleneagles but when it starts I think it’ll be really quiet.’ She also voiced concern that a footbridge built over the A9 at a notorious accident blackspot to link Gleneagles railway station to the hotel was only temporary. She said: ‘That’ll get taken down when the Cup finishes. So it’s OK for us to be knocked down but not tourists.’ Where it will all happen: The 18th green of the PGA Centenary Course at Gleneagles in Perthshire . But Maggie Robin, owner of ladies’ fashion shop Bear Necessities, was an enthusiastic supporter of the whole Ryder Cup extravaganza, saying: ‘You’ve got to embrace it.’ Charlie and Fiona Haggan, who own the Glendevon Hotel, accepted that local residents are likely to face delays and inconvenience. But Mr Haggan said: ‘Even if it takes three hours to get here because of the road closures, so what? It’s fantastic for the town. ‘My restaurant is three times busier, my staff are doing extra hours and I’ve recently built a beer garden and refurbished parts of the hotel. ‘Tom Watson’s family have booked out the hotel.’","Eyes of sporting world will be fixed on Perthshire when Ryder Cup begins .

"Robbie Mullen was bundled into a police van after giving his girlfriend Natalie Potter a kiss on the cheek . When Robbie Mullen planted an innocent peck on his girlfriend’s cheek over Sunday lunch, he never imagined it would see him bundled into a police van and warned about his behaviour. Mr Mullen’s romantic gesture offended one diner so much that she complained to staff, who then asked the civil engineer and his partner Natalie Potter to move tables. When he refused, the 43-year-old said he was ‘shocked’ to see four police officers arrive and march him outside where he was told he was not welcome in the restaurant. Mr Mullen said yesterday: ‘It is ridiculous. It was just a kiss – it’s not like we were there with our tongues down each other’s throats.’ The trouble started after the Dunfermline couple went to The Crooked Glen restaurant at Fife Leisure Park in the town for a family meal with Miss Potter’s five-year-old son, Charlie, last month. Miss Potter, 40, said they left Charlie in the soft play area and as the restaurant was busy, asked if they could share a large table nearby occupied by a lone man so they could keep an eye on the boy. When the man was joined by his wife, Mr Mullen noticed that she ‘wasn’t happy’ to find she was now sharing her table. He said: ‘It was packed and there weren’t any tables and there was one guy on his own. Natalie said can we sit there and he said no problem. ‘This woman turns up and right away I could see she wasn’t happy. We were ignoring them and just talking quietly and I leaned across and had a wee peck on the cheek, nothing more. ‘The woman drops her knife and fork and said, “That’s disgusting, I’m sat here trying to have meal with my husband.”’ Complaint: The Crooked Glen restaurant in Dunfermline where the couple were told to leave . Miss Potter added: ‘I said, “Beg your pardon” because I was really shocked and she said, “Get away from the table” and we just ignored her.’ Mr Mullen went on: ‘She goes and gets the manager, who comes over and says, “This lady wants you to move. Can you take your drinks through to the soft play area?”  She said, “I’m asking you nicely to move.” ‘The manager wanted to defuse the situation but she was siding with them, which got my back up a little bit so I said no, we hadn’t done anything. I said, “I’m not moving, you’re going to have to physically move me.” ‘This was all said quietly, no raised voices. The manager went away – I thought maybe a bouncer or someone might come over. ‘The next thing I know two police came in and put their hands on my shoulder and asked me to go with them to answer questions. While I was in the van two more came up in another van. ‘I thought something might  happen, but four policemen was a surprise. I told them what happened and they said it wasn’t a problem, but told me the manager never wants us back. ‘It was just a wee peck on the cheek.’ Miss Potter added: ‘They had Robbie in the back of a van and then another van arrived. ‘Just because he’s kissed me on the cheek they’ve been extremely offended by this but the place is full of families – I was there as a family. I was absolutely horrified – my son’s five and was petrified saying, “What have we done?” ‘It was so embarrassing – people were looking at us as though we were criminals.’ Police Scotland confirmed officers attended the pub ‘following a report of a customer dispute with staff’ at 4.20pm on February 9. A spokesman said that the ‘situation was amicably resolved on police attendance’ and that no one was arrested or charged. The Crooked Glen is run by the Brewers Fayre chain, part of the Whitbread Group, and advertises itself as a family and children-friendly environment. A Brewers Fayre spokesman said: 'Having spoken to our team members at the Crooked Glen, we are satisfied that staff acted appropriately in this instance. 'On the day in question two customers sat down, uninvited, at a table where another couple were already dining. 'Having interrupted the couple's meal, they then began behaving in a way that other diners found excessive and inappropriate. 'Following complaints to staff, they were asked to move to another table, which they refused to do. 'They then started using abusive language towards other diners and staff, at which point the police were called. The incident was dealt with at the scene and no further action was needed. 'As a venue for thousands of family celebrations every week, we have no policy that prevents couples from giving each other a kiss on the cheek in our restaurants.'","Robbie Mullen, 43, of Dunfermline, Scotland, was having dinner with his girlfriend Natalie Potter in The Crooked Glen restaurant .

"A two-year-old boy has died at the home he shared with his mother and her partner. Liam Fee was found by the emergency services after a neighbour heard a woman’s screams coming from the flat on Saturday evening.

McCusker, a friend of the couple, saw them taking Liam to the shops in . his pushchair at around 4pm, four hours before the alarm was raised. Miss McCusker, 35, said: ‘He seemed perfectly fine. They all seemed OK. The twins said hello and Liam smiled at my son. It’s horrible to think . that was the last time he’d be seen alive. It is such a tragedy.’ Parents: Rachel Fee, Liam's mother, and her life partner Nyomi Fee . Another . neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I heard a woman’s . crying coming from the flat. She sounded hysterical. Then the police . arrived.’ Local residents later saw Rachael leaving in a police car with one of the twin boys. Police . last night said no one had been arrested or detained in connection . with Liam’s death. A post-mortem examination is yet to be carried out. Uniformed officers maintained a highly visible presence outside the flat yesterday and carried out door-to-door inquiries. Forensic experts also spent  several hours at the property on Saturday night. Floral tributes and soft toys were left on the grass outside the flat by neighbours. The . two women both came  from Tyneside and struck up a relationship with . each other after Rachael split up with  the father of her three sons. The couple moved to Scotland about two years ago. They . took part in a civil ceremony in Fife a year ago and  Rachael changed . her name from Telfer to take Nyomi’s surname. The boys also began using . the name Fee. The couple . told friends that Liam suffered from autism. JJ had to use a wheelchair . after being  diagnosed with an infection in his lower leg and foot.

"Japanese researchers have revealed artificial intelligence software so smart it can beat most real students on a high school test. Known as To-Robo, the AI software scored higher on the English section of Japan's standardized college entrance test than the average Japanese high school senior, its developers said. It has also managed to double its score in just 12 months - raising hopes it will eventually pass the entrance exam for Tokyo University, Japan's most prestigious college. Man vs machine: Tokyo University helped this robot, Kirobo, which was sent to space. Now researchers hope to create artificial intelligence software so smart it can pass the university entrance exam itself. To-Robo was able to correctly choose the answer that best fits the following conversation: . A: I hear your father is in the hospital. B: Yes, and he has to have an operation next week. A: <insert answer> Let me know if I can do anything. B: Thanks a lot. Possible answers: . –Exactly, Yes . –No problem . –That's a relief . –That's too bad . 'The average score for the English section of the standardized entrance exam was 93.1 (out of 200), but the AI scored 95,' a spokesman for NTT Science and Core Technology Laboratory Group said. Last year the software scored 52. The NTT lab is developing the software alongside the National Institute of Informatics, and is in charge of developing the software's English capabilities. The project began in 2011 with a 10-year time frame for reaching its goal. Questions from the test were turned into data that could be recognized by the software. To-Robo then processed the information, distinguishing the logic of exchanges and correctly identifying the right answer out of multiple choices. 'One of our purposes is to reveal the limitations of AI,' said Noriko Arai, an NII professor who heads the project, told the Asahi Shimbun. 'Showing how humans and machines will be able to supplement each other is a key for Japan's economic growth in the future.' The latest test score results showed that Torobo-kun has a probability of at least 80 percent of passing the exams of 80 percent of 581 private universities across Japan. One reason is the great improvement in its scores for English and Japanese, Yoyogi Seminar officials said. The latest test score results showed that Torobo-kun has a probability of at least 80 percent of passing the exams of 80 percent of 581 private universities across Japan. However, they admit the software has has more work to do. The AI program cannot grasp unrealistic situations, such as an object with no mass or an environment with no friction, in the physics test. It also struggled with concepts it had never heard of - for instance, it did not know what democracy is like because it has yet to learn the idea of majority rule, social justice concepts and other related information. In the English test, it was unable to answer questions using figures and illustrations. It was better at recognizing photographs, the researchers said.","To-Robo software scored higher on the English section of Japan's standardized college entrance test than the average Japanese high school senior .

"Snooker champion Jimmy White has revealed that he battled with an addiction to crack cocaine at the height of his fame. The 52-year-old, nicknamed 'Whirlwind', became a favourite with fans in the 1980s and 90s and reached the final of the Snooker World Championship six times. But he has admitted that he was hiding a drug habit that cost him up to £10,000 a month said that the addiction 'probably cost him 10 world titles'. Scroll down for video . Addiction: Snooker player Jimmy White, known by his nickname the 'Whirlwind' has admitted to a crack cocaine habit that cost him £10,000 a month. He said that he is 'lucky to be alive' after living the way he did . Close: Jimmy White, pictured far left with fellow players Kirk Stevens, Alex Higgins and  Tony Knowles, recalled one occasion when he and Stevens took crack cocaine in a hotel room during the Irish Masters . Disappointment: Jimmy White, right with Ronnie O'Sullivan last year, reached the final of the Snooker World Championship six times but never won. On four occasions he was beaten by Stephen Hendry . In an extract from his new autobiography, Second Wind, which is serialised in the Sun, White told of smoking crack with his close friend and fellow player Kirk Stevens in a hotel room at the Irish Masters. White's glittering career has seen him win 10 professional ranking tournaments: . 2x The Classic (1986, 1991) 2x Grand Prix (1986, 1992) 2x British Open (1987, 1992) 1x Canadian Open (1989) 1x European Open (1992) 1x UK Championship (1992) 1x Players Championship (2004) He said: 'I think Kirk tried it first but I'm my own man and I don't blame anyone else for making me do something as stupid as smoking crack. The blame for that lies at my door only.' Kirk Stevens, who was accused of taking cocaine during a professional tournament in 1985, admitted his addiction to the drug in a series of newspaper articles published that year. Speaking of his own addiction, White added that he was 'lucky to be alive' after graduating from powder cocaine to the more potent crack. White reached the World Championship, held at the Crucible theatre, Sheffield, in 1984 and in every year from 1990 to 1994 but lost on each occasion. He said that his drug habit cost him 10 world titles. And the player admitted that he had 'frittered away' most of the prize money from his illustrious career, during which he has won 23 professional titles including the 1992 UK Championship. White, who appeared in the 2009 series of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, said that he had 'one sneaky account with NatWest' that he dipped into to fund his habit. He said: 'I did the lot in less than three months. Every penny.' In the extract he wrote: 'Jimmy White... snooker hero... people's champion... crack addict. Sounds far-fetched, doesn't it? But for about three crazy months it was true.' Habit: White, pictured left at a competition in 2010, became a fan-favourite in the 1980s and nineties. The player, who appeared in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2009 (right) said he 'frittered away' his winnings . 'Stupid': White (pictured second from left) said Kirk Stevens (second from right) 'probably tried cocaine first' but said that only he was to blame for his habit. Also pictured above, Tony Knowles (left) and Alex Higgins (right) White, known as the best snooker player to have never won the championship, has also admitted to battling with alcohol and gambling habits. After losing the World Championship Final to Stephen Hendry in 1994, White spent his tournament earnings of £128,000 on gambling - in 24 hours. Speaking in a 2008 interview with the Daily Mail, he said: I don't know when I had time to sleep. Or play snooker! I wouldn't ever practise, I was too busy enjoying myself. 'People's champion': White, pictured during a 2007 tournament, is regarded to be the best player to have never won a world championship. He said that he emptied a bank account in six months funding his habit . Successful: Jimmy White has won 10 professional ranking tournaments in his glittering career, 1984 Masters (pictured above), the 1992 UK Championship and two Grand Prix crowns . 'Once I went three days solid without sleep because I was gambling. From 20 to 30, that was my life. I was sick. He added: 'I've had my dark days, but I wasn't really a hell-raiser as such,' he protested. 'I liked to drink and I liked to party but I never did anyone any harm, never hurt anyone. All I did was hurt myself sometimes.' White, also beat testicular cancer after being diagnosed in 1995.","Jimmy White, nicknamed 'Whirlwind' admitted to £10,000-a-month habit .

"'Very bitter': Martin and Jacqui Clark want the names of TripAdvisor reviewers made public . The owners of a Scottish B&B last night accused TripAdvisor of operating ‘above the law’ after the couple lost a bitter legal wrangle over bad reviews posted on the global travel guide. Martin and Jacqui Clark went to court in an attempt to force the £3billion organisation to disclose details of the writers of two negative online posts so they can sue the authors. The Clarks, who run the nine-bedroom Tigh na Cheo guest house at Kinlochleven, Inverness-shire, maintain that both reports posted within a month of each other were fabricated and malicious. They wanted to raise an action for defamation against whoever posted the comments, claiming the poor reviews damaged their reputation and cost them business. But their legal bid stumbled at the first hurdle yesterday when a judge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh rejected a request for a disclosure order to force TripAdvisor to reveal the names, addresses and other information on the authors’ identity. In a judgment that could have far-reaching implications for other victims of bad reviews, Judge Paul Arthurson, QC, ruled Scots courts have no jurisdiction in the matter. An angry Mr Clark, 55, said the ruling would allow TripAdvisor’s army of unverified reviewers free rein to post ‘anything on any pub, restaurant, guesthouse or hotel in the world and, frankly, get away with it’. He added: ‘This effectively means that TripAdvisor will continue to have a licence to defame and libel with impunity. It’s just unbelievable. My wife and I feel very bitter about it.’ In their petition, the Clarks maintained that the disputed postings purported to review events that did not take place, were not submitted by actual travellers and were not posted contemporaneously. Both writers claimed to have visited the premises in September 2011, but the reviews did not appear until February and March the following year. At an earlier hearing, Graeme Henderson, counsel for the Clarks, told the court they were applying to seek assistance from the company over the identity of the two individuals named in the reviews as ‘edna B’ and ‘dreckit’. But, the court heard TripAdvisor, whose headquarters are in Boston, Massachusetts, set out in its terms and conditions that users agreed that all claims against it arising from the site must be heard in the US state. Target: The owners of the nine-bedroomed Tigh Na Cheo guest house in Inverness-shire insist they were the victims of 'fabricated and malicious' reviews on TripAdvisor . The judge was told that Mr Clark accepted that he had ticked a box acknowledging that he agreed with those terms and conditions in the course of his use of the website. He said that the legislation under which the disclosure order was sought ‘does not empower the Court of Session with worldwide jurisdiction to ordain persons such as the respondents [TripAdvisor] to produce information’. The judge added: ‘I conclude that the approach contended for on behalf of the petitioners would require the court in turn to make a rather alarming entirely global assertion of jurisdiction.’ Speaking after the ruling, Mr Clark said: ‘It seems this company can effectively do what it wants in the UK – it’s above the law.’ He added the upset caused by the case had prompted him and his 50-year-old wife to try to sell the B&B. Though considering their position over an appeal, Mr Clark said: ‘I don’t think we can go any further from here because it will just go on and on and I am not prepared to fork out another sizeable amount of money.’ A TripAdvisor spokesman said it did not comment on individual cases of litigation but insisted it took fraud seriously. He said: ‘Every single review goes through our tracking system, which maps the how, what, where and when of each review, and we use sophisticated automated tools and algorithms to spot patterns of  unusual activity. We back that up with a team of over 200 content specialists, who work 24/7 to maintain the quality of our reviews.’ Since it was founded by . entrepreneur Stephen Kaufer only 14 years ago, TripAdvisor has grown . into the world’s largest travel website and one of the most . controversial. With . more than 200 million visitors a month worldwide trusting its . recommendations to book trips, a run of good or bad reviews can . potentially make or break a business. But . there are consistent grumbles that the website is growing too powerful . and its system of unverified reviews is too open to abuse. Three . years ago, the Advertising Standards Authority began an investigation . into the firm before ordering it to remove its slogan ‘reviews you can . trust’ and banning it from claiming reviews are from ‘real’ travellers. In . 2012, a new link was established with Facebook allowing users to see . reviews written by members on their ‘friends’ list. As a result, a . previously anonymous user was exposed as Peter Hook, a hotel executive, . who had posted glowing reviews about his firm’s properties. The . same year, KwikChex, a reputation- management company, deliberately . submitted three fake reviews for a defunct restaurant. Just over a month . later, the reviews were still on the site and the restaurant had risen . to 17th best in London. Also . in 2012, Helen Griffiths, a marketing manager from Salford, was ordered . to apologise as part of a police caution for  harassment after posting . 30 false and malicious reviews about a vegan restaurant, The Good Life, . on TripAdvisor. She . admitted: ‘I made these comments based on absolutely no knowledge of . the business, or any of the company’s staff, as I have never actually . visited or eaten at the restaurant.’ Last . year, fresh doubts about the global giant’s fraud detection system, . based on anti-credit card and insurance fraud algorithms, were raised . after a non–existent business briefly became one of the most highly . rated restaurants in Brixham, Devon. A . TripAdvisor spokesman said every one of the 60 reviews posted every . minute was checked using the system, but added: ‘No system, verified or . not, is perfect, and we are continually working to stay ahead of those . attempting to cheat the system.’","Martin and Jacqui Clark accuse TripAdvisor of operating 'above the law'

"More employees are ditching the old-fashioned phone calls and using  text messages or emails to call in sick instead. But Australian workplaces have increasingly cracked down the technology-based sickies unless they are legitimately too sick to call, a leading recruitment agency told the Herald Sun. The Fair Work Commission has warned employees that if they are caught on social media spending their day off, rather than being 'sick' in bed, they could face the consequences of getting fired. Scroll down for video . Workplaces are increasingly cracking down sickies through text and email . Marketing and advertising company Brand Easy Australia director Andrew Fabien told Daily Mail Australia that he would prefer his employees to make a phone call when they're sick. 'Majority of my staff are aged between 18-30 and most of the younger ones definitely prefer contacting us via text or email rather than a phone call,' he said. 'I don't mind if they text the night before but if they're going to text me the morning before their shift, it'll definitely get under my skin because it doesn't give me enough time to prepare work and organise someone else to cover their shift. 'When an employee  texts me at the last minute, to me, I personally think they just couldn't be bothered going to work that day or just some lazy excuse to get out of it. 'I've always asked my staff to be courteous about calling in sick. At this stage, I haven't considered banning texts or emails but if it does get to a point, then I'd have to go down that path.' More employees are ditching the old-fashioned phone calls and using emails or text messages to call in sick . Mr Fabien also added that he has seen Facebook posts from employees going out the same night they called in sick for work that day. 'I never confronted them but it just reflects their work ethics and integrity,' he said. 'For example, as an employer you would think twice about promoting someone with those characteristics.' Brand Easy Australia proprietor Rakesh Joshi told Daily Mail Australia that it's very unprofessional to text but a phone call would sound more genuine. 'When you call, your boss has the ability to hear your voice and is less likely to think you're lying about your condition,' he said. Fair Work Commissioner Leigh Johns told the Herald Sun: 'If they publicise the fact that they have taken an illegitimate sick day, it's more likely than not that there will be consequences. 'It could be a valid reason for termination, depending on the circumstances of the case, such as being warned in the past.' It's been reported that 15,000 annual unfair dismissal cases have used social media posts against employees who  revealed they were out and about after calling in sick, according to the Herald Sun.","Workplaces are increasingly cracking down sickies through text and email .

"There were no winners when a two-metre carpet snake slithered away with an empty stomach after spending four hours trying to swallow a possum whole. Photographs of the epic battle were snapped by Ipswich truck painter Tim Sharman at his Bellbird Park house - west of Brisbane. Mr Sharman and his cousin were enjoying a few beers on Saturday when they were interrupted by a loud bang. Scroll down for video . A two-metre-long snake tried to eat a 40-centimetre-long possum in the Ipswich suburb of Bellbird Park - west of Brisbane . Truck painter Tim Sharman took snaps of the prey being eaten by the reptile on Saturday night . 'We saw the snake and possum fall off the roof, the snake had the possum wrapped up tight,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'They made a lot of noise when they fell off the roof and then rolled around on the concrete for a bit fighting. 'There was a big bang as they hit the hand rail [of the stairs] and the concrete.' And it seems the possum did put up a bit of a fight as Mr Sharman said it took the snake 30 minutes to kill the marsupial before feasting. 'The snake started eating the possum's head first and he slowly worked his way up the body of the possum,' he said. While Mr Sharman snapped pictures of nature taking its course, he heard 'a lot of grunting' from the possum while it was still alive as the snake coiled itself around its prey. 'The noise from the snake when eating was like heavy breathing,' he said. Mr Sharman said it took the snake four hours from about 8pm for it to reach the possum's hind legs. But it proved to be too big of a mouthful for the snake because it started regurgitating the possum - which was 40cm long - back up. It took half an hour for the snake to kill the possum before it started eating it . The snake took about four hours trying to eat the possum after a loud bang was heard by Mr Sharman and his cousin . Australia's leading snake expert, Raymond 'Snake Man' Hoser, said that by the standard of carpet snakes, this wasn't actually large. 'I'd say this was about 8 foot, and they can get up to 10 foot long,' Mr Hoser said. Carpet snakes are found all across Australia, with this particular variety, a Brisbane carpet snake, found all along the Queensland coast. 'I catch these more than any other snake, because they're obviously quite big and move slowly,' 'They normally live up a tree, and people will come out into their yard and see one there and freak out.' Mr Hoser has over 30 years experience with snakes and other reptiles, having discovered and named over 300 types of snakes all over the world. He said that he often feeds roadkill to snakes, but that snakes in the wild have a harder time digesting animals. 'A snake that eats something the size of that possum runs a good risk of dying, because if the food goes cold in it's stomach it will start to rot before it's digested properly,' Snake Man said. 'Septicemia will set in and the snake will die. If you feed a snake road kill in captivity, they have a much higher chance of survival, because they can keep warm and allow the food to digest.' Mr Hoser said that this particular carpet snake probably regurgitated the possum because it got 'nervous.' 'It's certainly big enough, it shouldn't have had any trouble getting it down. I'd say it got a bit scared of the bloke taking the photos and vomited it up so it could leave.' Mr Sharman and his cousin were having a few beers before they saw the snake and possum who fell off the roof . The snake abandoned the possum after four hours after trying to eat it, stopping just before the marsupial's hind legs . The snake then gave up and regurgitated the possum back up, leaving Mr Sharman with the clean up . He said he had heard the possum grunting while it battled for its life and the snake heavily breathing as it ate .","An Ipswich truck painter snapped photographs of a snake eating a possum .

"It is one of the country’s newest, and most sentimental, Christmas traditions: a festive offering guaranteed to reduce even the most hardened Scrooge into a sniffling, tear-sodden wreck. It is no surprise, then, when Lucie Edwards starts to dab her eyes. Because she is the mother of the boy starring in this year’s John Lewis Christmas TV commercial and she is sitting down to watch it for the first time. It prompts Lucie Edwards to hug her eight-year-old son Rhys, who was chosen from hundreds of hopefuls to star in the £1 million advert. Scroll down for video . Rhys Edwards, the eight-year-old boy who stars in the news John Lewis ad sits down with his mother Lucie Edwards to watch the commercial . He beams with pride, but is dry-eyed – and must be one of the few people in Britain to remain unmoved by the 60-second film. For those who haven’t seen it yet, this year’s John Lewis advert tells the heart-warming story of Sam and his penguin pal, Monty. The inseparable pair are seen playing Lego and romping in the park, but it soon becomes clear that Monty is lonely for love. Fast-forward to Christmas Day and Sam surprises Monty with his gift of a mate, Mabel. The pair rub beaks, singer Tom Odell’s melancholy cover of the John Lennon song Real Love soars – and the nation reaches for the hankies. ‘Are you crying, Mum?’ Rhys asks, noticing his mother’s tearstained face. ‘You are, you’re crying! Oh, Mum!’ he teases. ‘All right, all right,’ replies Lucie, regaining her composure. ‘I’m just so proud of you.’ Rhys was chosen from hundreds of hopefuls to star in the heart-warming festive ad. He is pictured with two of the toy penguins given to him by John Lewis . Devotees of Christmas commercial breaks might be forgiven for thinking that Rhys looks more than a little familiar. Despite his tender age, he is, we can reveal, quite the ghost of television Christmas past. Last year, he played the adorable boy in the DFS Christmas advert. The year before, he was cast in the McDonald’s Christmas spot – and made an appearance in the Christmas special of Call The Midwife. The John Lewis ad is arguably his biggest role, and one he’s keen to repeat. ‘I’m the king of Christmas adverts!’ he declares. ‘I’d really like to be in the John Lewis Christmas advert every year from now on. I do miss everyone from John Lewis.’ Lucie, 34, says: ‘He is like the Christmas child. I think it’s all down to that cheeky face and grin. The directors of the John Lewis advert told me one of things they liked about Rhys was the dimple he gets when he smiles. It’s actually a scar from when he fell out of his bunk bed when he was aged five. ‘His dad and I are always telling him to look after his face, then he falls out of bed.’ Rhys started acting at five after being taken on by child talent agency Daisy & Dukes. ‘One of the ladies who worked at Rhys’s nursery had children at the same agency,’ explains Lucie, who owns a domestic cleaning franchise and lives in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. ‘She kept saying Rhys would be brilliant at acting because he’s got a great face and a lovely personality. I thought it would be nice for him to build his confidence and if he enjoyed it, that would be all well and good. As a little one he was quite sociable and I wanted him to build on that.’ Rhys sometimes does up to two castings a week in London, meaning he has to leave school early. When filming, he has to take time off, although the John Lewis ad was filmed long before Christmas – in the summer holidays. ‘It’s not like the kids are being taken out just to go on holiday. It’s learning of a different kind. Rhys is not sitting on a beach or at home doing nothing,’ Lucie says. Rhys, playing seven-year-old Sam, opposite Monty the penguin in a scene from the new ad . Before he auditioned for his latest role, Rhys, who has a younger brother and sister, had taken a break from acting to move house and schools. ‘I was a bit nervous,’ Rhys says. ‘Mum said I would get £2,500 so I was excited too. ‘But then she said, “Don’t get your hopes up too much, there are millions of people going for it.” Then a letter came through saying I’d got it so I was happy.’ John Lewis has given Rhys an enormous Monty toy and smaller Monty and Mabel figures – which have already sold out on the retailer’s website. John Lewis says more will be available next week. So will Rhys spend some of his fee on a penguin onesie (£20) or a pair of penguin cufflinks (£20), perhaps? He says thoughtfully: ‘Mum says I can’t really spend any money in my bank because I need to save up for a car. There is a remote-control dinosaur which costs £100 that I’d like, though,’ he adds, giving his mother a pleading look. ‘What my dad wants – and I want too – is a drone. They’re £369, which isn’t that expensive.’ ‘That is quite expensive, Rhys,’ Lucie reminds him. ‘He’s become aware of how much money he has in his bank account from his acting work and asks to buy this, that and the other,’ she explains. ‘But I’ve told him a car could cost up to £10,000. The concept of how much things cost hasn’t really sunk in. I’m keen to keep his feet on the ground and teach him the value of money.’ The advert has already been watched by millions on television and 4.5 million viewers on YouTube. Lucie says Rhys was treated like a star during filming and had his own Winnebago mobile home for part of the shoot. At times, she admits, this treatment went to his head. Rhys, left, in a scene from last year's Call The Midwife Christmas special and right, in a festive advert for high street furniture store DFS last year . ‘He had the Winnebago to himself in the morning,’ Lucie recalls. ‘But by the afternoon there were a few other people using it. ‘I remember Rhys saying in quite a loud voice, “Mummy, there are some people in MY trailer,” which was a bit embarrassing.’ He could also request whatever he wanted for lunch, provided it was healthy. ‘The catering van didn’t really have things for children so the poor runners were sent out all over South London to get Rhys a jacket potato or chicken nuggets,’ Lucie laughs. Sugar was banned during the day but Rhys was allowed ice cream at the end of filming. Now ‘the king of Christmas adverts’ has his eye on more substantial roles. His agent has put him forward for a part in the fifth Pirates Of The Caribbean movie – and Tinseltown could then beckon. ‘If he wanted to become a Hollywood actor that would be lovely,’ Lucie says. ‘The minute he says he doesn’t enjoy it, then that’ll be it. It’s completely his decision.’","Rhys Edwards is the star of the new John Lewis Christmas TV commercial .

Keith Bristow, the director general of the National Crime Agency, said it was an 'uncomfortable' reality that officers needed to concentrate on the worst abusers. Mr Bristow said this meant some paedophiles watching online child abuse would inevitably escape justice. His remarks sparked a furious response tonight – with Labour accusing him of perusing a 'disgraceful' policy which would see the 'vast majority of people downloading vile images' escaping justice. Mr Bristow said 50,000 people access indecent images of children each year and the police cannot arrest all of them. He said: 'I don't think I can be more candid than say, if there are 50,000 people involved in this particularly horrible type of criminality, I don't believe that all 50,000 will end up in the criminal justice system being brought to justice . 'Our responsibility is to focus on the greatest risk and tackle those people. 'But the wider responsibility that falls to all of us is to stop people getting involved in this activity, to help young people protect themselves and to work hard to understand the totality of the problem so where we are arresting people and bringing them to justice that's mitigating as much risk to young people as possible. 'That's uncomfortable. But these are the uncomfortable conversations we need to have.' He added: 'But the reality is everyone who accesses an indecent image of a child, the idea that every single one of them is going to go into the criminal justice process, is not realistic. 'As abhorrent as even the lower risk part of this is, and it's still abhorrent and it's still horrible, particularly when seen alongside other things like acquisitive crime, we're going to have to start thinking differently about not just how we pursue these people but how we prevent people perpetrating this particular form of horribleness.' He added: 'What we can't do is start at number one and work through to 50,000. 'What we have to do is apply a logic based on law enforcement experience, and academic support, to work through and try and find the highest risk that sits within that and our contention is the highest risk are those people who go on or have the propensity to commit contact abuse, which is right at the high end. 'And that's the challenge we've got.' Labour's shadow health secretary Yvette Cooper attacked the 'disgraceful' policy which left children at risk . Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper MP said Mr Bristow had revealed the Government's 'disgraceful policy' which was leaving children at risk from dangerous abusers. She said: 'Now it's clear the NCA have details on tens of thousands of people who have accessed vile images of child abuse. 'Yet only 600 have been arrested and they are not even attempting to investigate the vast majority of cases. Of course they need to look first for the most dangerous cases, but it seems most cases aren't being investigated at all. 'It's clear now that the NCA is simply not fit for dealing with the scale and seriousness of this problem.' But Jon Brown of the NSPCC said Mr Bristow had revealed 'an uncomfortable truth'. He said: 'It's true that the police can only do what they can with the budgets available to them. The Government must make tackling this vile trade a priority in the funding available to the NCA and at a local force level. 'There are clear links between accessing this material and contact offending. That risk is obviously increased if offenders have access to children through their work, family or accommodation. 'The volume or severity of the imagery accessed is not always the most important indicator of risk and an offender's personal or professional circumstances can be far more telling.'","Police chief Keith Bristow revealed 50,000 people view online abuse .

"Mario Mandzukic has said he will leave Bayern Munich after the World Cup because coach Pep Guardiola's style of play does not work to his strengths - putting a host of Premier League clubs on red alert. Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United are among the English sides believed to be monitoring the Croatia striker's situation and will take encouragement from those words. Mandzukic was left out of the squad for Bayern's 2-0 German Cup final win over Borussia Dortmund last month as his fallout with former Barcelona manager Guardiola became clear. Wantaway: Mario Mandzukic (centre) says he will leave Bayern Munich after the World Cup . Style: Mandzukic (right) says manager Pep Guardiola's tactics do not suit his abilities . The 28-year-old told Croatian newspaper Sportske Novosti: 'I met (Bayern chairman) Karl Heinz Rummenigge before the cup final and told him I wanted to leave the club. 'I've had a fantastic time at Bayern. It's a great club and I never thought I'd want to leave, and especially not at this point in time. 'But, let's be honest, I cannot play to my strengths under Guardiola's style - no matter how hard I try. 'I realised that after the 1-0 defeat by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final first leg and, that being the case, it's best for all parties that we go our separate ways. 'Guardiola is an outstanding coach and I wish him and everyone else at the club all the best in the future. 'Bayern and the club's fans will remain the best and most emotional chapter in my career.' Mandzukic helped Bayern win an . unprecedented treble for a German side in his first season at the club . under Jupp Heynckes, scoring 22 goals. Dropped: Guardiola did not pick Mandzukic for the 2-0 German Cup final win over Borussia Dortmund . Prolific: Despite his reservations about style, Mandzukic scored 26 goals in 48 games last season . Despite returning even better figures under Guardiola - 26 goals in 48 games - rumours surfaced that the Croat was uncomfortable playing the Spaniard's tiki-taka style and preferred a more direct approach. Mandzukic will miss the opening match of the World Cup for Croatia against hosts Brazil on Thursday through suspension after he was sent off in the second leg of November's 2-0 aggregate play-off win over Iceland. His striking qualities are undoubted and he will have many suitors among Europe's top clubs but Mandzukic himself would not reveal where he will be moving. He said: 'It's time for a fresh challenge but don't insist because I have nothing to say. The public will be informed when the time comes, right now I am focused solely on the World Cup.' Success: Mandzukic won a treble and a double at Bayern under Jupp Heynckes and they Guardiola . Pressure: Guardiola came under criticism from some sections of the fans and media at the end of last season .","Manduzkic says he will depart the German champions after the World Cup .

"Jean Wright, pictured yesterday, is suing St Peter's College, Oxford, for public interest disclosure, unfair dismissal and disability discrimination . The Oxford University college where a bursar claims she was sacked after a conspiracy to oust her had a 'prevalent' culture of racism, prejudice and sexism, a tribunal heard today. Jean Wright, 60, claimed she was fired from her role after she pushed for a university archivist colleague to be dismissed over harassment allegations - a move she says turned other staff against her. College master Mark Damazer CBE, a former controller of BBC Radio 4, yesterday rubbished the 'spurious' allegation, saying it was 'untrue and without foundation.' Mrs Wright, from Kidlington, Oxfordshire, is suing St Peter's College for public interest disclosure, unfair dismissal and disability discrimination. Today a former employee described a culture of 'unpleasant sexist, racist and bullying staff' working at the college. Former bursar Richard Gordon today also spoke out in support of Mrs Wright, saying that there was a campaign against her. He added that Geoffery Fouquet, the volunteer archivist whom Mrs Wright pushed to be dismissed, was 'condescending' and 'sexist'. St Peter's College's alumni includes actor Hugh Dancy, Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and former FA executive David Davies. Mr Damazer, who was awarded his CBE for services to broadcasting, took up his role at the college in October 2010. Early in his time there, Mrs Wright - an employee for 17 years - told Mr Damazer she was angry with how the college handled a complaint she made the previous year about Geoffrey Fouquet. Mr Fouquet had apologised following an investigation but Mrs Wright made renewed allegations of harassment and bullying in June 2012 and a new probe was launched. This was dismissed but Mr Damazer decided he wanted to replace Mr Fouquet by Christmas 2012. Mrs Wright appealed the probe's findings but when this was rejected she took time off from work. Around the same time there were concerns about an investigation Mrs Wright led into allegations about another member of staff, Roger Hall, which resulted in his dismissal. This decision was subsequently overturned, after which Mrs Wright met Mr Damazer. Mr Gordon, 53, said that he was pleased when maintenance engineer Roger Hall was initially sacked after making offensive comments about a colleague. The tribunal in Reading, Berkshire, heard that on 8 August, 2012, Mr Hall described a woman called Ruby as a 'lazy cow' and a 'black cow'. He was also alleged to have said that Ruby had a 'fat a**e' and that his body was the size of one of her legs. Mrs Wright was sacked from St Peter's College (pictured) after 12 gross misconduct allegations were made . Mr Gordon said that he was pleased when Mr Hall was sacked because he was 'part of a culture of unpleasant sexist, racist and bullying staff and we had been unable to act against them. 'A culture of racism, prejudice and sexism was prevalent across the support staff in college and when I came across it I was keen to demonstrate that the college would not tolerate it.' Mr Gordon, who left the college in September 2012, also hit out at fellow Henrietta Leyser, who he accused of running a campaign against Mrs Wright. This included making two allegations that Mrs Wright had hit colleagues at the college. Investigations found there was no proof of this. College master Mark Damazer CBE, a former controller of BBC Radio 4, rubbished the 'spurious' allegation, saying it was 'untrue and without foundation' Mr Gordon described Mr Fouquet as 'condescending, sexist, arrogant and rude'. The former bursar said: 'Geoffrey Fouquet was a loose cannon. Nobody could control him and no one took responsibility for doing so.' Earlier, former college development manager Kate Longworth told the tribunal there were people at the university who 'had it in for Jean'. Ms Longworth said Mr Fouquet was 'deeply unpleasant' to work with and that he spent 80 per cent of the time talking about Mrs Wright. But another colleague said that Mrs Wright used to  'scream, shout and swear' at staff and put them in fear of losing their jobs, one former colleague told the tribunal. Tracey Pullen, head housekeeper at St Peter's College, said Mrs Wright's treatment caused her to have sleepless nights. Ms Pullen, employed by the college for 14 years, described how Mrs Wright would 'rule the staff with bullying and intimidation.' She said: 'I understand that people have been marched out of the building with no notice and others have resigned as a result of her behaviour.' 'The anxiety and stress of dealing with Jean over the years had built up to such a point that I felt I could not go on anymore.' Mr Damazer denied there was any conspiracy to oust Mrs Wright as a result of the Fouquet allegations. This view was backed up by Professor Lionel Mason, a college fellow appointed to head the appeal hearing into Mrs Wright's dismissal. Professor Mason, who taught applied mathematics, told the tribunal: 'I considered that there was significant damage done across all of the departments she managed and that staff had expressed great distress because of the claimant's behaviour.' 'I did not find any link between the Fouquet complaints and the allegations which were made genuinely because staff were upset.' The decision to fire Mrs Wright was upheld following an appeal hearing on December 16, 2013. The tribunal has also heard there were concerns about an investigation Mrs Wright led into allegations about another member of staff, Roger Hall. Professor Mason said: 'The claimant's negative view of Roger Hall and her intimidation of witnesses in the investigation had inevitably corrupted the process.' The case continues.

"A nursery worker had the shock of her life when she gave birth on her lunch break in the toilet. Hannah Brown, 27, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was just 28 weeks pregnant when she had to deliver her own baby in the loo at work. At three months premature, newborn April, now two months old, was rushed to Gloucester Royal Hospital to the intensive care unit. Nursery worker Hannah gave birth on the toilet floor at work as baby arrived three months early . After a nerve-racking two months, four weeks before Hannah's due date, Hannah and husband Kyle, 29, brought their healthy baby girl home. Hannah, head of the baby unit at Tree Tops Nursery, said: 'I was having my lunch break with my colleagues when I felt really uncomfortable so I went to the toilet. 'I was on the loo when I knew I could feel the baby's head. 'I called for help for someone to get me an ambulance but there wasn't time. 'I could hear the sirens when April just whooshed out onto the floor. 'I was in such disbelief that I had given birth in the toilet at work.' The premature baby was taken to hospital where her development was monitored, and thankfully, she was discharged from hospital after just eight weeks - four weeks before her due date. She woke up and didn't feel quite herself but didn't think much of it, so went to work as usual . Hannah and baby April were taken by ambulance to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital . Hannah Brown had started the day in July just like any other, and went to work at Tree Tops Nursery which was celebrating its 25th anniversary. She said: 'I woke up and didn't feel quite myself but I didn't think much of it and went to work. 'I'd had a scan the day before and everything was fine with the baby so I wasn't worried. 'But when I was having my lunch break with my colleagues I started to feel really uncomfortable. 'I went to the toilet and knew what was coming. I just thought, right, that's the head.' Hannah called out for her colleagues who called 999 and her husband Kyle. With the paramedics on the end of the line, Hannah delivered her baby in the toilet. Hannah added: 'I could hear the sirens but April just whooshed out with such force her umbilical cord broke. 'I didn't know what to do I was in such shock. 'April was on the floor so my manager told me I better pick her up. 'I scooped her up and we waited for the paramedics.' Hannah and April were taken by ambulance to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and April went straight into intensive care where eventually Kyle was able to join them. Kyle said: 'I had a missed call on my mobile whilst Hannah was at work and by the time I had rang back she'd already had the baby. 'I was passed on to paramedics but my phone ran out of battery. 'I frantically packed a bag for Hannah and called Hannah's dad using the house phone and he came and picked me up. 'It was a complete and utter shock as there was no indication she was going to come so early. 'When I got to the hospital April was already in the intensive care unit and Hannah had already been checked over.' April went straight into intensive care, and two months later the proud parents took her home . As April was three months early, doctors had to battle hard to keep her alive. She was diagnosed with sleep apnoea and at five weeks old, April gave her parents the fright of their lives. Kyle said: 'She stopped breathing for over 30 seconds. It was terrifying and we had talks about possible blood transfusions, but thankfully she pulled through. From that day onward, it was full steam ahead and she just got stronger every day.' And after a rapid recovery, April shocked her parents again when she was allowed to come home one month before her original due date of October 10. Kyle said: 'We didn't expected her to come home so early but she was doing amazingly well the doctors said they were struggling to find a reason to keep her in any longer.' Hannah added: 'It was more of a shock that she was well enough to bring her home than her unexpected arrival. 'At hospital you live in a baby bubble so it is so nice to be home to start family life.' And coming home was an extra special occasion for Hannah and Kyle. Last year, they lost their first born Finn who was still born at 32 weeks. Kyle added: 'It was hard having delivered Finn that we were unable to bring him home and it was tough having to walk past the suite where he was born every time I went to visit April and Hannah in hospital. 'But although there have been difficult times before, we will never forget the little boy we had and the day we brought April home.'

"You may have experienced the frustration of being slapped with a parking fine or finding your car clamped after leaving it parked precariously for a couple of minutes. But now a high-tech car sticker that's designed to be stuck to a car’s windscreen, could help motorists avoid such a situation by allowing a traffic warden to get in touch with them. The TowStop sticker sends a text message to a driver when touched by a traffic warden, to allow motorists to send a reply and give them time to move their car promptly. Scroll down for video . A high-tech car sticker (pictured) that's designed to be stuck to a car’s windscreen, could help motorists avoid parking fines and having their car towed away, by allowing a traffic warden to get in touch with them . It’s designed to save drivers time and money by giving them a chance to move their car instead of having it towed away but relies on the good will of traffic wardens. Frankfurt-based IT consultant, Daniel Kalliontzis, came up with the idea and is raising funds on Indiegogo to put his €54 (£43) sticker into production. The smart sticker will be attached to the inside of a car's windscreen using suction pads. When a traffic warden touches it, the sticker will switch on and will send an automated text message to the car's owner, telling them to move their car immediately. The TowStop sticker will display a message to a traffic warden on its screen, sent from the car owner, such as 'I am on my way back to the car. I will be there in two minutes'. It can be recharged via a USB cable and is available to pre-order for €54 (£43). The sticker is designed to be used in Germany, because of a law that states traffic wardens must choose the fastest and cheapest way to move a car parked in the wrong place. But traffic laws vary from country to country, so it may not work in the UK, for example. The sticker displays a message from the car's owner telling a parking warden that they are returning to their car. In Germany, where traffic wardens have to choose the cheapest and fastest way of moving a car, it could stop drivers parked in precarious places getting fines - but traffic laws vary in different countries . MailOnline has asked the Department of Transport whether the stickers could be used in the UK to avoid motorists getting fines (stock image) Car owners can buy the sticker and place it inside their car's windscreen, having set it up with vital information, such as their phone number. The slim design will include a sensor that when touched by a traffic warden, will send a text message warning a driver about an imminent fine. The message will ask them to move their car immediately. The driver could then type a reply for the warden using their smartphone, which will appear on the sticker's screen. They may choose to write something along the lines of ‘back in two minutes' in a bid to avoid a fine. The smart sticker system will rely on the good will of traffic wardens and critically, a German law. The law states: ‘An officer has to choose the most efficient and inexpensive way for the car owner to remove the vehicle.’ It could be cheaper for the authorities to contact the driver than to tow his car. MailOnline asked the Department of Transport whether the sticker could be used in the UK in a similar way. A spokesman said:'In England there is no legal obligation to warn the motorist before issuing the ticket. However, a local authority does have the discretion not to issue a ticket if they believe the situation deserves some leniency or want to issue a warning. 'If the government wanted to force councils to warn motorists before issuing tickets we would need to change the law.' At the time of writing, Mr Kalliontzis has raised just over €3,000 (£2,362) of his €50,000 (£39,381) goal on Indiegogo. If he manages to raise the money, the stickers will be shipped in June 2015. It appears that car owners using the smart system could get some unnecessary warning messages, because anyone could touch the smart sticker.","TowStop sticker is designed to be used in Germany and is available to pre-order from Indiegogo for €54 (£43).

"Over the past few months a block of apartments which were formerly public housing have become some of the most expensive real estate in town. Six apartments in the inner-Sydney suburb of Millers Point have recently sold for more than a million dollars each, but proposed changes to the City of Sydney's heritage laws could see the new owners renovation plans dampened. The changes mean that buyers could be banned from building additional storeys or adding rooms to the apartments, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Proposed changes to Sydney's heritage laws could hinder renovation or extension plans for the new owners of Millers Point apartments . This move could also see the sale prices for the remaining heritage-listed apartments plummet. Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore has been a critic of the plan to sell the 200 properties and relocate the public housing tenants, and has rallied to help the displaced people. This week a proposal will go to a council committee with the aim of preventing any extensions or expansions to the apartments. Currently the requirements of the Millers Point buildings state that they can be up to nine metres high and the apartments' floor space can be twice the side of the block of land. Some properties in the exclusive Sydney suburb went on sale earlier this year after the former public housing tenants were relocated . Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore has been a critic of the plan to sell the 200 properties and relocate the public housing tenants . This means, according to a council report, expansions between 30 and 110 square metres - in the form of an extra bedroom or . The report said any expansion 'will have a significant impact on … the integrity of the conservation area and heritage items"". Some height and floor space increases may still be allowed under the proposal, but would need to adhere to specific conservation plans for each apartment. The City of Sydney was asked by the NSW Heritage Council to reconsider these controls, telling The Sydney Morning Herald that buys would: 'seek to maximise … development potential'. New restrictions could prevent owners from expanding the buildings, for which a high price was paid due to the location of the apartments . The proposal could also see the properties devalued by up to $350,000 . Malcom Gunning, president of the Real Estate Institute of NSW said any alterations would cause sale prices to dive, and could see properties devalued by up to $350,000. '[The proposal] will affect the price because, in their current form they are probably not worth the money [being] paid', he told the website. The eviction of the former tenants from the prime real estate properties has always been a contentious issue, but the government's justification was that money could be made to house them in other suburbs. Family and Community Services minister Gabrielle Upton said it wasn’t fair to the 58,000 applicants on the social housing waiting list for the government to spend hundreds of millions of dollars maintaining properties unsuitable for public housing.","Miller Point properties started going to auction earlier this year .
Formerly public housing, the sale saw previous tenants evicted .
Proposed changes to NSW Heritage laws could restrict renovations .
These could also greatly devalue the prime real estate properties ."
