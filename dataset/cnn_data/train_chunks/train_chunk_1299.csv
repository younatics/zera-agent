"Hot stuff: The Naga Chilli Vodka packs 250,000 Scovilles . Vodka fans with an adventurous side can add a bit of spice to their lives as Master of Malt launches the world’s hottest chilli vodka. At 250,000 on the Scoville scale, the new Naga Chilli Vodka is so hot it comes with a special health warning. Its launch comes just months after the company released the 100,000 Scovilles Naga Chilli Vodka. The new version is 2.5 times hotter. The chilli used in the vodka is the Naga Jolokia, which is known to be one of the hottest chillis it is possible to grow, and rates higher on the Scoville scale than most law-enforcement grade pepper sprays. Each Scoville unit denotes how many times the chilli must be diluted by its own mass of water until the heat is only just detectable. A Jalapeno has an estimated 5,000 Scovilles. The Naga Jolokia can exceed 1,000,000 Scovilles. The drink is made by fermenting litres . of vodka with 18kg of the fiery peppers. The potent chillis are infused in large . vodka-filled carboys for many weeks before bottling, and the bottlers must wear . gas masks and rubber gloves when handling the chillis and final vodka to . protect their skin, eyes, noses, and lungs. The resulting concoction is . left for several weeks to infuse, and once the vodka has turned a dark caramel colour, the infusion is complete and the vodka can be bottled. The drink is recommended as a mixer, with expert mixologists suggesting it can be used in a classic Bloody Mary for a drink with extra kick. Dangerous: The Naga Jolokia chilli is fiercely hot and can be hazardous if ingested raw or unprocessed . The 250,000 Scovilles - Naga Chilli Vodka will be available from 2 October at www.masterofmalt.com and costs £31.95 for 50cl. 'I was blasé when the small, sinister-looking bottle of Naga Chilli vodka landed on my desk. Sure, it was made of the formidable Naga chilli - known to be one of the world’s hottest – and it promised to pack a palate-scorching 250,000 Scovilles  - but I didn’t believe it could pose too much of a problem. 'i love hot stuff – I lived in Jalapa, the Mexican birthplace of the Jalapeno chilli, in my twenties and thought I’d battle-hardened my palate against scorching hot peppers with 14 months of regular chilli-chomping. 'I am as addicted to a regular hit of capsaicin as others are to nicotine, and I have eaten enough limp chilli sauces claiming to be straight out of Satan’s you-know-what that have not raised as much as a tingle that I take marketing spin with a very large pinch of salt. 'This time though, the product met up to its promise. One capful of the stuff had my eyes bulging out of my head. My gums were on fire, my tongue felt like it had been stung by a thousand ants and my lips felt like they’d doubled in size... I loved it. 'Rest assured, this initial pain doesn’t last long. Five minutes later the fierce sting subsided and I was left with nothing more than that pleasant warm tingle that had me reaching for a second hit.'

"An elite Tory dining club that enjoys direct access to David Cameron in return for cash has given more than £43million to the party, it can be revealed. The secretive Leader’s Group of major donors is open only to those prepared to give the Conservatives at least £50,000 a year. In return, they are promised regular dinners, lunches and drinks reception with the Prime Minister and other senior Tory figures. Social: David Cameron MP and wife  Samantha entertain guests at The Conservative Summer Party, held in The Grounds of The Royal Hospital Chelsea, London . No list of members has ever been published and details of the topics discussed are never revealed. But data released to the Daily Mail in the wake of the 2012 ‘Dinners for donors’ row reveals that 72 members of the group have taken the opportunity to dine privately with Mr Cameron and other senior ministers in the past 18 months. Between them, they have given the party £43.4million since 2001. Some have attended at least six Leader’s Group events since 2012. The decision to publish limited data follows controversy in 2012 when it emerged that Mr Cameron had hosted secret dinners for major donors at his Downing Street flat and at Chequers. Ministers always denied that donors had used their access to influence policy but quarterly lists of donors who have attended events with the Prime Minister are now published. Under fire: A critics said these events where David Cameron, pictured was present were 'straight up cash for access of the type that we¿ve got very used to in this country' The disclosures will, however, raise concerns about the influence of behind-the-scenes lobbying and the ability of the rich to buy access to Mr Cameron. Other ministers who have attended the events include Chancellor George Osborne, Foreign Secretary William Hague, Home Secretary Theresa May, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. There is no evidence that the hedge fund bosses, property magnates, oil executives and others involved have ever asked for or received policy changes. But critics warn that the secrecy surrounding the events will inevitably raise suspicions. Tory sources insist that, in publishing the names of those attending functions with the Prime Minister, they are being more open than Labour. Ed Miliband has failed to keep his pledge to publish regular lists of meetings with union barons and other major donors. A Tory source said it was ‘malicious’ to suggest that members of the Leader’s Group enjoy undue influence. But Alexandra Runswick, director of campaign group Unlock Democracy, said the revelations would fuel public concern. ‘Whenever there is secrecy there is suspicion,’ she said. ‘It is very difficult for a member of the public to see a businessman spending £50,000 to meet David Cameron at a private dinner and not feel there is something going on that is not in their interests.’ The Leader’s Group was set up in 2003 and has grown to become a key part of Tory fundraising. Membership is dominated by financiers. Those attending dinners in the past 18 months include a dozen hedge fund bosses and five bankers, including three former executives from failed banks Lehman Brothers and Barings. The group also includes the wives of two controversial Middle Eastern businessmen not eligible to donate in their own right. Tamasin Cave, of the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency, said the Leader’s Group was the ‘tip of the iceberg’ in the hidden world of secret influence: ‘It’s straight up cash for access of the type that we’ve got very used to in this country. A seat at these dinner parties provides these businessmen with a private space in which to discuss their concerns, whether its taxes, regulation or policy. They’re not just social occasions. ‘At the same time, the Government... is pretending to expose such lobbying with a sham register of lobbyists. People are fed up with a system that provides an open door to government for the wealthy and well connected, while everyone else is excluded.’ Access: David Cameron had hosted secret dinners for major donors at his Downing Street flat and at Chequers, pictured, it has emerged . Labour MP Michael Dugher said: ‘It’s no wonder the Prime Minister stands up for the wrong people when he is selling access to a privileged few.’ But Labour was silent on why Mr Miliband has failed to publish details of his own meetings with major donors, including the trade union bosses who have bankrolled his leadership to the tune of more than £24million since 2010. A Conservative Party spokesman insisted that the operation of the Leader’s Group was above board and all donations declared to the Electoral Commission. The revelations follow controversy this week over the Government’s refusal to publish a full list of the people entertained by Mr Cameron at Chequers. Tory sources said data showed that since 2012 no dinners had been held for donors at the PM’s official residences, including Chequers. The Conservatives declined to say where Leader’s Group dinners are now held or what is discussed. Members of the Leader’s Group include Russian businessman Alexander Temerko, right, who has attended two events and donated more than £200,000 to the Tories since 2012. Mr Temerko runs a wind farm firm, Offshore Group Newcastle. Last summer he paid £90,000 for a . bust of Mr Cameron at a Tory fundraising event. The Leader’s Group also includes the wives of two controversial Middle Eastern businessmen. May . Makhzoumi, pictured below with her husband, who has given more than £1million since 2010, is married to Lebanese businessman Fouad Makhzoumi, who was caught up in a scandal involving Conservative Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken. Rosemary Said, who has given the party . almost £580,000, is married to Syrian-born businessman Wafic Said who . made a fortune as a fixer to the Saudi Royal Family, including the . controversial Al Yamamah arms deal with the UK. Scottish property tycoon Malcolm Scott, who has given almost £850,000, attended a dinner with Mr Cameron in the spring of 2012 while his business empire was collapsing. It has since gone under, leaving debts of millions. Venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft, right, attracted controversy in 2012 after writing a report for Mr Cameron on cutting red tape, which included a proposal to allow employers to fire staff at will. Mr Beecroft has given more than £750,000 but his key recommendation was rejected by the Government because of opposition from the Liberal Democrats. Others the list include the celebrity hairdresser John Frieda, who has given the party more than £260,000, musician Michael Batt, who has donated more than £160,000, and Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross, who has donated more than £220,000. The Leader’s Group also contains some of Britain’s wealthiest individuals. Richest is the industrialist Sir Anthony Bamford, whose family is worth an estimated £3.1 billion and who has given more than £2.5million. Others include the hedge fund boss Michael Hintze and pharmaceuticals magnate Lord Ballyedmond.","Leader’s Group of major donors open only to those giving £50,000 a year .

An earlier version of this article said Alexander Temerko was wanted for fraud in Russia and that donations he made to the Conservative Party were cleared by the Electoral Commission. We are happy to clarify that a British court found that the charges were politically motivated and that the donations did not require clearance because Mr Temerko is a British citizen."
"David Cameron was today accused of showing a 'callous' lack of humanity for refusing to help drowning immigrants fleeing North Africa on ramshackle boats. The Prime Minister has withdrawn support for rescue operations that save thousands of migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, amid fears traffickers use them as a ‘taxi service’. But the decision was attacked by Labour leader Ed Miliband today, who accused Mr Cameron of showing a lack of 'basic humanity' during Prime Minister's Questions today. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband slammed the Government's decision to stop saving migrants fleeing Africa on boats . The PM said: ‘On immigration his government combines callousness with incompetence. They don’t show basic humanity and say rescuing drowning people is a pull factor for immigration. ‘But they are so incompetent they can’t deliver their basic promises. Why doesn’t he just admit it, on immigration, he has failed?’ But Mr Cameron rejected the accusation and accused Labour of leaving 'the biggest mess this country has ever seen' when it came to immigration. People traffickers are allegedly setting off from North Africa with satellite phones and calling the Italian coastguard to come and pick them up. The decision by ministers provoked outrage from refugee groups who said it would lead to more people ‘needlessly and shamefully dying on Europe’s doorstep’. But British officials insist the huge rescue operation has led to more attempted crossings and put more lives at risk – as traffickers try the journey in less seaworthy crafts. Several thousand people have died attempting to make the crossing in the past 12 months. Of those who survived, many have headed north to Calais and tried to get in to Britain. Dangerous: Migrants arriving at Lampdeusa. In the past year around 150,000 people making the treacherous crossing from North Africa, many in ramshackle boats, have been picked up by the Italian navy . The Italian government is to stop search and rescue operations after thousands were picked up this year, including 600 would-be immigrants rescued from the Mediterranean sea in a single weekend in September . Italy launched its air and sea rescue operations last year in the wake of the Lampedusa tragedy in which hundreds of migrants died when their boat caught fire. Since then the Mare Nostrum mission has seen Navy ships patrolling vast areas of the Mediterranean and picking up migrant vessels. But it is due to end this week, and will be replaced on November 1 with a more limited border security operation, known as Triton, run by EU border agency Frontex. This will patrol a much smaller area closer to Europe’s southern border and will not actively search out migrants in difficulty. Earlier this month Foreign Office minister Baroness Anelay told the House of Lords: 'We do not support planned search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. 'We believe that they create an unintended 'pull factor', encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths. 'The Government believes the most effective way to prevent refugees and migrants attempting this dangerous crossing is to focus our attention on countries of origin and transit, as well as taking steps to fight the people-smugglers who wilfully put lives at risk by packing migrants into unseaworthy boats.' Refugee Council chief executive Maurice Wren said: 'The British Government seems oblivious to the fact that the world is in the grip of the greatest refugee crisis since the Second World War. 'People fleeing atrocities will not stop coming if we stop throwing them life rings; boarding a rickety boat in Libya will remain a seemingly rational decision if you're running for your life and your country is in flames. 'The only outcome of withdrawing help will be to witness more people needlessly and shamefully dying on Europe's doorstep. 'The answer isn't to build the walls of fortress Europe higher, it's to provide more safe and legal channels for people to access protection.' The new operation, called Triton and run by the EU's Frontex borders agency, is due to commence on November 1 but has a 'very different' objective from Mare Nostrum. Frontex spokeswoman Isabella Cooper told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'Our operation covers a very specific operational area and we only have a few vessels and a few aircraft. The Mediterranean Sea is over 2.5 million square kilometres large - it is virtually impossible to have a full overview of what is happening at sea. A picture from the Italian Navy Press in February shows a boat with African migrants on board spotted by the Navy at sea near Lampedusa, Italy . 'Our operation is exclusively that of border control. Mare Nostrum is an operation that aims at search and rescue, so these two operations are very different.' Michael Diedring, secretary-general of the European Council on Refugees, told Today that the EU should fundamentally change its approach to the problem, allowing more people to enter legally. He said: 'One of the reasons these people are making the journey is because the policy of the European Union is that there are almost no safe and legal means to access European soil to file an asylum claim, for example. There is only resettlement, and resettlement numbers are quite low, but that is the only legal way. 'So individuals who are stranded in North Africa, who are fleeing for their lives, who are running from persecution, from war, who have no choice because their homes have been bombed and destroyed, their family members have been killed, they have been raped and tortured and gone through horrendous journeys along the way, the only way that they can attempt to come to Europe is through organised criminals. 'If Europe allowed a safe and legal way for people to come, they could use the money that they are paying to criminals and they could buy first-class aeroplane tickets to Europe.'","Italian rescue ships have rescued tens of thousands of immigrants .

"In a pair of stunning 1993 memos from the Clinton White House, advisers to Bill and Hillary Clinton railed against physicians for putting personal greed ahead of 'Hillarycare' medical insurance reform, and wrote that scheduled listening-session meetings with health care stakeholders were political exercises organized purely for show. Doctors suffer from an 'emotional irrationality' and a sense that they have a '""right"" to be over-compensated,' wrote attorney Amy Lee Stewart to Hillary Clinton and her health care guru Ira Magaziner. The Bill Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas released more than 4,000 pages of memos on Friday as part of the lengthy process of opening previously secret materials to the public. Those were the days: The Clinton White House reasoned that doctors would only oppose the 'Hillarycare' insurance reform because they were greedy . Stewart is, and was, an antitrust specialist working for Little Rock's Rose Law Firm, which was later implicated in the Whitewater real estate scandal when the Clintons refused to produce billing records from Mrs. Clinton's tenure at the firm. Stewart wrote of her perception 'that physicians are, on the whole, very agitated about what they perceive to be infringements on their ability to continue to make money which supports them in the lifestyle which they have anticipated and enjoyed over the last few decades. Her complaint anticipated objections from the American Medical Association, which favored antitrust exemptions for any doctors who banded together to cut costs in the wake of new regulatory costs. 'They believe they are being (or will be) sandwiched between managed competition in which they have little power to protect their comfortable income and autonomy,' Stewart wrote, 'and increased taxes which will also reduce their spending power.' She also seemed to mock health care providers for a sense of entitlement about the income levels that follow years of education, internships and low-paying residencies. 'Their misperceptions about taxes, malpractice reform, managed care, antitrust enforcement and their ""right"" to be over-compensated must all be addressed as much as possible,' Stewart wrote. 'Their remaining emotional irrationality cannot, and should not, be addressed by permitting anticompetitive behavior which will undermine the goals of reform.' Reached at her law office, Stewart told MailOnline that she was 'sorry that I can't be of any help.' 'You have caught me on a busy Friday . afternoon and are asking about something I worked on over 20 years ago,' she said. Rose Law Firm antitrust attorney Amy Lee Stewart (L) and future Labor Secretary Alexis Herman (R) wrote frank memos at the outset of the doomed Hillarycare effort which today sound callous . First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton would later move to New York, win a seat in the U.S. Senate, and become the U.S> secretary of state -- and now she's mulling a run for president . In another memo, a staffer who ran the White House Office of Public Liaison – in charge of interfacing with special interest groups – and her assistant, briefed the first lady on a plan to host two days of public hearings about her health care push. 'The primary goal for this two day hearing would be to inoculate ourselves from charges that we are refusing to listen to all those groups out there that want input,' wrote Alexis Herman, the future Labor Secretary, and Mike Lux. 'Even though our primary goal is political inoculation,' they counseled, 'we should not lose the opportunity for some public education.' 'Some testifiers should be average people with horror stories, middle class families worried about the future, and senior citizens. These average people should testify during those periods when we believe more people will be watching.' The Little Rock documents were held back from public view for 12 years after the end of the Clinton administration, and should have been released a year ago. Now that they have hit the Internet in large batches, Republicans will likely mine them for material they can use against Mrs. Clinton, who is expected to be the Democratic standard-bearer in the 2016 presidential election.","Stunning memos shed light on back-room cynicism behind 'Hillarycare' plan in the 1990s .

"An elementary school teacher from Lafayatte, Colorado stood up to the school's board about a policy towards poor children she felt was 'disrespectful.' A few weeks later she was fired. Noelle Roni, elementary school principal at the Peak to Peak Charter School of 9 years, believes she was fired because very publicly objected to students with no money in their lunch accounts having to get their hands stamped. Roni believes that school board politics are to blame for her termination and she is fighting to get her job back, reports CBS. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Nicole Roni was principal at Peak to Peak Charter School for 9 years before she was fired . Roni opposed the school board's decision to make kids with no lunch money in their account have their hands stamped for other children to see . 'The kids are humiliated. They’re branded. It’s disrespectful. Where’s the human compassion? And these are little children,' she told CBS. Roni felt that if students had to have their hands stamped based on socioeconomic differences, they would be bullied by their peers and made to feel uncomfortable. Parents from the school met at a local church in Erie on Monday to talk about potentially revoking two of the school's board members. 'I feel she was bullied, and we want her back,' one parent told CBS . Roni told reporters that she'd had heated discussions with the school board before but that she was taken aback by their reaction. 'I was shocked that their reaction was not outrage. That it was more of ‘Who are you to tell us not to do this?’ ' she said. CBS spoke with the school's attorney Barry Arrington who said that the school wont discuss their reason for firing Roni in depth but that her allegations are 'absurd.' 'Three outside lawyers agree her claims are baseless,' Arrington said in a statement. Roni says she isn't afraid to sue the school. 'If we have to, we’ll file suit,' she said. 'When I see something that I feel harms children, I speak up,' she continued. Roni's staff bio is still on the school's website. 'I look forward to working together, as a community, to meet the needs of every child,' she writes. Roni became the elementary school principal in 2005.

"His demise has variously been blamed on murder, leprosy, a snake bite or a fall from a chariot. Now a new theory about the death of Tutankhamun has been put forward by a British scientist who  believes the young pharaoh’s ‘man boobs’ may hold the key. Hutan Ashrafian, lecturer in general surgery at Imperial College London, said historians have missed evidence that the boy king of Egypt, who died mysteriously 3,000 years ago, may have had a type of epilepsy that lay behind his ‘feminised physique’ and could have caused him to die in a fall. Riddle: Tutankhamen may have died from a genetic disorder which caused him to have a feminine physique . He says sculptures and paintings of . the pharaoh, and four of his close male relatives, show they had . unusually large breasts and wide hips. Not only that, but all of these . kings died relatively young suggesting they may have shared an inherited . condition, Mr Ashrafian says. In a fresh review of evidence, he . found historical accounts hint at what this was, as two of the five . pharaohs are associated with stories of religious visions. He believes . they had a form of epilepsy in the brain’s temporal lobe in which . seizures can cause vivid hallucinations. Mystery: King Tut's tomb was discovered in 1922, sparking debate over the cause of his young death . This would also explain their . feminine features, as the temporal lobe is connected to parts of the . brain involved in the release of sex hormones. Since Tutankhamun’s tomb was . discovered in 1922, the cause of his death has been the subject of . intense debate. Clue: Statue depicts the Pharoah's large breasts . Mr Ashrafian says several statues of Tutankhamun  who . died aged 18 or 19, reveal ‘prominent’ gynecomastia, the medical term . for man boobs which is rare in depictions from the period. His mummified body was too damaged by . those who found it to know, but recent X-rays showing broken bones . suggest he died in a fall, which could have been brought on by a . seizure, he said in the journal Epilepsy and Behaviour. His theory is backed up by the fact . that the two pharaohs who came before Akhenaten - Amenhotep III and . Tuthmosis IV - also appear to have had similar physiques. King Tut's stunning tomb was discovered in 1922, sparking considerable debate over the cause of his young death. Examination of Tutankhamun's mummified body revealed he had a fractured leg which Dr Ashrafian believes could have been the result of an epileptic seizure. Akhenaten experienced powerful visions following which he raised the status of a minor deity called the 'sun-disk,' or Aten, into a supreme god. This was a major departure from ancient Egyptian beliefs that there were many gods and is thought to have resulted in the earliest recorded monotheistic religion - the idea that there is only one god. Tuthmosis IV also experienced a religious vision in the middle of a sunny day which was recorded in the Dream Stele, an inscription discovered near the Sphinx. King Tut's predecessor Tuthmosis IV experienced a religious vision in the middle of a sunny day which was recorded in the Dream Stele, an inscription discovered near the Sphinx . Dr Ashrafian added: 'People with temporal lobe epilepsy who are exposed to sunlight get the same sort of stimulation to the mind and religious zeal.' Howard Markel, a medical historian at the University of Michigan, points out that the theory is impossible to prove as there is no definitive genetic test for epilepsy. He said: 'It’s a very interesting hypothesis, but it’s just that — there’s no definite proof.'","British surgeon believes King Tut had a hormonal imbalance caused by temporal lobe epilepsy .

"A former police motorcyclist who said riding powerful bikes as part of his job damaged his hearing has won a £6,500 payout. Peter Hall, 56, from Stockport, suffered deteriorated hearing and developed tinnitus, or constant ringing in his ears, as a result of his work with the British Transport Police (BTP)  motorbike unit in Manchester. Mr Hall's job called for him to ride fast 650cc and 1100cc motorbikes for the team for more than a decade, responding to emergency calls on the rail network throughout Greater Manchester. Former police motorcyclist Peter Hall, 56, won compensation after saying the loud bikes damaged his hearing . Mr Hall owns a Honda Pan-European 1300 bike but says it doesn't have sirens and he doesn't ride it as fast . After retiring, he noticed he had hearing loss and tinnitus, and hospital tests confirmed that the father-of-three's hearing had suffered because of his work on noisy motorbikes with sirens. Mr Hall said he decided to take action after he spoke to a motorcycle officer from another force and realised BTP had done ‘nothing’ to help protect his hearing. The force settled the case without going to court and paid him £6,500 compensation. Mr Hall said: 'All they had to do was provide us with regular hearing tests and the proper equipment, [but] they didn’t do anything. 'The health and safety laws are in place to protect people at work but BTP was not interested. Their attitude was: ""Just get the job done, we don’t care how, just do it"". He added: 'In the last few years of service, they tossed us a pair of ear plugs but they were pointless because you couldn’t hear the police radio while wearing them. We needed proper protection and to have our time on the bikes limited. Big bikes: Mr Hall worked for the BTP for more than a decade, responding to emergency calls . 'My hearing has been damaged and they could have done something about it for ten years.' He said he struggles to hear people speak when in group situations, and has constant ringing in his ears, often when he gets home to a quiet house after being out. Mr Hall joined BTP in 1981 and transferred to the Manchester motorcycle unit, based at the city's Piccadilly Station, in 1999. He had to leave the force in 2011, with a total of 30 years' service, after he was badly injured on duty when a 4x4 ran into the back of him at traffic lights in Levenshulme. A keen motorcyclist at home, he rides his own Honda Pan-European 1300 bike, but said this was taken into account by lawyers. Mr Hall said his fight with BTP had nothing to do with money - he was motivated by his principles . And he said: 'The difference is, I don't ride my bike at those sorts of speeds, and it doesn't have sirens.' Mr Hall, who now works for a car dealership, said he brought the case as 'a matter of principle', and was not concerned about money. He said: 'BTP needed to be brought to task. Somewhere, somebody should be held to account.' His solicitor Christopher Briggs said: 'I am pleased his hearing loss has been recognised as work-related and that he has some compensation.' A spokesperson for British Transport Police (BTP) saiD: 'Following a civil claim by former officer Peter Hall, BTP agreed to pay Mr Hall the sum of £6,500 compensation. 'This was a result of informal negotiations between Mr Hall’s legal team and BTP, the force has never made a formal acceptance of liability for Mr Hall’s hearing damage. 'The health and safety of our officers and staff is paramount to BTP, and as such we always look to review cases of this nature in order to continually improve our systems and processes.' Tinnitus is a term that describes any sound a person can hear from inside their body. It is often described as a ringing in the ears but the sounds that can be heard include buzzing, humming, grinding and hissing. Sometimes the sound beats in time with the person's pulse. The condition can cause sleeping problems and depression but, in itself, it is not harmful. There is no underlying cure for tinnitus, which mostly affects people over 65 (file picture) The underlying cause is not known but it can be caused by earwax, an ear infection, stress, a head injury or exposure to loud noise. There is no single cure for tinnitus but sometimes it can be addressed by treating the underlying cause - for example, through removing earwax build-ups. Tinnitus is often worse in quiet environments so some people benefit from listening to soothing sounds, such as the sound of the ocean. The condition is most common in people over the age of 65 but it can affect people of all ages. About ten per cent of the population are thought to have the condition, though most have it mildly.

"For years, experts wondered how Stonehenge was built and where it's famous stones came from - now a chunk of the area widely thought to have provided the famous rocks has gone on the market for £2million. The parcel of 577 acres of Fyfield and Overton Downs near Marlborough, Wiltshire which is up for sale is part of the landscape from which Neolithic people extracted the stones to make the 5,000-year-old monument. The land still contains hundreds of 'sarcen stones' - known locally as grey wethers due to their resemblance to hillside sheep - which were mysteriously transferred 25 miles south in around 2,600BC. The sale of the land is being described by estate agents as 'a truly unique opportunity to acquire a protected landscape steeped in history'. A 577-acre slice of the Fyfield and Overton Downs near Marlborough, Wiltshire has gone on sale, dotted with 'sarcen stones' like those used to make Stonehenge around 5,000 years ago . The 'sarcen stones' scattered over the site are believed to have named using the Anglo Saxon terms 'sar', meaning troublesome, and 'stan', meaning stone, due to the problems they caused for farmers . Sarcen stones are believed to have been mined in the area before being taken 25miles south to Stonehenge - where they were used alongside the larger 'bluestones' brought from south-west Wales. File photo . The land is designated as a Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which means it is carefully protected by authorities and has strict rules on development. It does however come with its own racehorse track - known as the Manton Derby Gallop - and a three bedroom cottage called The Delling, which estate agents say is 'in need of substantial renovation'. The gallop is so named, despite being straight, as it was previously used as a trial gallop in the weeks before the Epson Derby. The cottage, which is 915 square feet and comprises two reception rooms, a kitchen and bathroom has a mains water supply but has been empty for 30 years. The area is said be excellent for pheasant and partridge shooting and one writer has described the surrounding downs as 'one of the most glorious areas for walking in Wiltshire'. The estimated 35 acres of woodland which comes with the land contains two drives for shooting and three game pens. The land contains a racehorse track - known as the Manton Derby Gallop - which was previously used as a trial gallop in the weeks before the Epson Derby . It also comes with a three-bedroom cottage called The Delling, secluded in an area of woodland, which has been empty for 30 years . The area of land is said to contain one the best collections of sarcen stones in Britain and is loved by walkers . The 35 acres of woodland on the site, which surround the cottage, contain two drives for shooting and three game pens . The land's most unique feature however is the thousands of sarcen stones which scatter the hills and landscape. The word 'sarsen' has been suggested to have come from the Anglo Saxon terms 'sar', meaning troublesome and 'stan', meaning stone, because of the hindrance they posed to agriculture. Stonehenge was built using two types of stone - sarcen stones, which are believed to have been brought from Fyfield and Overton Downs - and 'bluestones', which are believed to have been transported, by sea, from south-west Wales. The exact method of transportation is still disputed, but most archaeologists believe they were moved using water networks before being hauled over land on sledges. It is thought a ditch and bank were created at Stonehenge around 3000BC and it was used as a burial ground. The cottage, set in the area of woodland, is about three miles from the town of Marlborough and 15 miles from Swindon . Estate agents have described the sale as 'a truly unique opportunity to acquire a protected landscape steeped in history' Sheep wander between the stones - which are also known as grey wethers due to their resemblance to the animals from a distance . The bluestones were brought there around 2600BC and placed in two circles. The sarcen stones were then mined from the area around Marlborough 200 years later. Neolithic people are thought to have believed the stones had supernatural or healing power and were prepared to go to extreme lengths to harness them. A number of myths surround the site. One the of earliest originated in the 12th century in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s History of the Kings of Britain, which claims the wizard Merlin brought the stones from Ireland using magic. Another myth claimed the Devil brought them across the Irish sea, after tricking an old woman by telling her he would pay her as much money as she could count while he gathered up the stones. She thought the task would take a long time and that she would be as ‘rich as a princess’. But, the legend goes, the Devil tricked her, for as soon as she started counting the money he quickly bundled up the stones and vanished. Stonehenge is often associated with Druids, but English Heritage have said there is no evidence to suggest they built or carried out ceremonies at the site. The downland provides pasture for livestock and the property comes with a licence to graze and mow until February 2015 . Overton Down and the adjacent Fyfield Down have been described as 'one of the most glorious areas for walking in Wiltshire' Numerous ancient trackways run across Overton Down, one of which leads from the Avebury circle, another ancient monument, to the market town of Marlborough .","Land near Marlborough, Wiltshire goes on sale  scattered with stones like those used in Stonehenge monument .

"An Oklahoma history teacher faces losing his job for having a Benjamin Frankiln poster with a controversial quote based on 'choosing a mistress' on the wall of his classroom. Steven Alcorn, 62, who has taught for 38 years, was suspended from Marlow High School last week for having a picture of a cat alongside the phrase: 'In the dark, all cats are grey.' It is paraphrasing a letter the Founding Father wrote to a friend in 1745 called 'Advice to a Young Man on Choosing a Mistress' - urging a man he should chose an older woman companion. Steven Alcorn was suspended from Marlow High School in Oklahoma last week for having a picture of a cat alongside the phrase 'In the dark, all cats are grey' in the classroom. It is a quote from a letter by Benjamin Franklin (right), written in 1745, advising a young man that he should choose an older mistress . In the passage, the politician writes: 'It is impossible of two women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the pleasure of corporal enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior.' In the 19th century it was deemed obscene and was not originally published in his original letters. Alcorn, a Civil War reenactor, has been working at the school for six years and it is believed he had the poster up since he started. Richard O'Carroll, the teacher's attorney, told the Duncan Banner: 'My client was teaching history accurately. 'Just as Ben Franklin was a great man in terms of science and a founder of our nation, he was still a man. People need to know these things, not just the myths and legends, but who they are. 'We hope that cooler heads will prevail,' he added. 'There is still time for the school board to do nothing. If they do make a recommendation, we are looking forward to a full and fair hearing before the school board. We expect an exoneration.' Career: The 62-year-old, who has been a teacher for almost 40 years, is believed to have had the poster in the classroom since he started at Marlow High six years ago . Alcorn told the paper that he wanted to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and get back into the classroom. A Facebook group supporting his re-instatement has already reached 302 members and his wife Jera has also posted her support. Former student Amber Abrego told KFOR News 4 she never thought the quote was a big deal and thinks Alcorn's suspension is unfair. 'I think it`s awful, why would you want to do that to someone who has been so loyal to their school, who came to every single football game? 'I hope that he gets to keep his job. I hope that he gets more respect out of this because he deserves it. He`s a good man, he's a good teacher. However Brian Jacob, who works in a bait shop in the city, admitted he could see where the school is coming from. Decision: Alcorn's disciplinary hearing at the school is set for January 20 when he will hear his fate. He says he hopes the issue will be resolved quickly so he can go back to work . 'Nowadays everything`s really touchy on subjects like that. Suspended? I can see it,' Jacob said. The letter is taught in schools today because it was used in the 20th century to overturn U.S obscenity laws. It wasn't the only letter of Franklin's to be censored in the US. His satirical piece 'Fart Prouldy' was excluded from the majority of his published works. Attorneys used it to prove that if it had been mailed or published, one of the country's Founding Fathers would have been prosecuted. Education officials from Marlow Public Schools declined comment on Alcorn's case because it is a personnel issue and a pending legal matter. According to the Banner, Alcorn's disciplinary hearing has been set for January 20. The public school board is set to have already discussed the matter but have not released any details. Explicit content: The controversial correspondance written by the Founding Father was considered to be obscene and was not published in his collection of letters . My dear Friend, . I know of no Medicine fit to diminish the violent natural Inclinations you mention; and if I did, I think I should not communicate it to you. Marriage is the proper Remedy. It is the most natural State of Man, and therefore the State in which you are most likely to find solid Happiness. Your Reasons against entering into it at present, appear to me not well-founded. The circumstantial Advantages you have in View by postponing it, are not only uncertain, but they are small in comparison with that of the Thing itself, the being married and settled. It is the Man and Woman united that make the compleat human Being. Separate, she wants his Force of Body and Strength of Reason; he, her Softness, Sensibility and acute Discernment. Together they are more likely to succeed in the World. A single Man has not nearly the Value he would have in that State of Union. He is an incomplete Animal. He resembles the odd Half of a Pair of Scissars. If you get a prudent healthy Wife, your Industry in your Profession, with her good Economy, will be a Fortune sufficient. But if you will not take this Counsel, and persist in thinking a Commerce with the Sex inevitable, then I repeat my former Advice, that in all your Amours you should prefer old Women to young ones. You call this a Paradox, and demand my Reasons. They are these: . i. Because as they have more Knowledge of the World and their Minds are better stor'd with Observations, their Conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable. 2. Because when Women cease to be handsome, they study to be good. To maintain their Influence over Men, they supply the Diminution of Beauty by an Augmentation of Utility. They learn to do a 1000 Services small and great, and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick. Thus they continue amiable. And hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman. 3. Because there is no hazard of Children, which irregularly produc'd may be attended with much Inconvenience. 4. Because thro' more Experience, they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an Intrigue to prevent Suspicion. The Commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your Reputation. And with regard to theirs, if the Affair should happen to be known, considerate People might be rather inclin'd to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man, form his Manners by her good Counsels, and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes. 5. Because in every Animal that walks upright, the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part: The Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding2 only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement. 6. Because the Sin is less. The debauching a Virgin may be her Ruin, and make her for Life unhappy. 7. Because the Compunction is less. The having made a young Girl miserable may give you frequent bitter Reflections; none of which can attend the making an old Woman happy. 8thly and Lastly They are so grateful!! Thus much for my Paradox. But still I advise you to marry directly; being sincerely Your affectionate Friend.

"Experts have discovered that Mount Snowdon is a whole metre taller than originally thought. Three ramblers, John Barnard, Graham Jackson and Myrddyn Phillips, have remeasured the UK's second tallest mountain using state-of-the art GPS technology and found it actually stands at 1,086m and not 1,085m as recognised by the Ordnance Survey (OS). However, the OS will not be altering their maps as the natural summit of the Welsh peak is still 1,085m, although a man-made plinth that was erected in 2009 to mark the top added an extra metre. Scroll down for video . Mount Snowdon is the second tallest mountain in the United Kingdom and three ramblers have learned that it is, in fact, a metre higher than recorded by the Ordnance Survey . Graham Jackson and John Barnard (second right and right), pictured with two other ramblers, measured Mount Snowdon and found that it is actually a metre higher than the Ordnance Survey records . The village of Llanberis (bottom right) lies in the shadow of Mount Snowdon (top left) The addition means that the 400,000 hill-walkers who ascend Snowdon every year physically climb 1,086m to reach the top and not 1,085m. Mr Hughes, 53, said: 'Our survey of Snowdon accumulated six hours of data which was later post-processed using Ordnance Survey state of the art software, which gave a result of 1085.67m, which is rounded up to 1,086m. John Barnard (right) switches on the Leica GS15 to gather the first of two sets of three hours of data needed to measure the exact height of Mount Snowdon . 'This result means that the highest part of the natural summit tor which is now buried under the summit plinth is approximately 1084.8m high or 1.085m. 'So although the natural bedrock and the Ordnance Survey map height of 1085m will remain the same, it means that all those thousands of hill walkers who struggle up what they think is a mountain of 1085m in height are in affect climbing one extra metre and arriving at the top of Snowdon peering out on a land that is 1086m below them.' The early morning vigil to discover the exact height of Snowdon: (left to right) Aled Llyr, Graham Jackson, Mark Greaves, John Barnard and Stephen Edwards . An aerial view of the man-made plinth that was erected in 2009 to mark the top added an extra metre . Mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington holds the Olympic torch on the summit of Mount Snowdon on May 29, 2012 . Mr Barnard and Mr Jackson are retired research chemists from Mold, North Wales, and Cheshire respectively, and Mr Hughes is a former manager at a printing firm and lives near Shrewsbury. They have measured more than 150 hills in England, Scotland and Wales since 2008 and have elevated two hills to mountain status, which in England and Wales is classed as 2,000ft. In 2008 they measured Mynydd Graig Goch in Snowdonia at 2,000ft and six inches - up from 1,998ft. In 2013 they upgraded Thack Moor in the Cumbrian Penines from 1,998ft to 2,000ft. There is no precise international definition of what constitutes a mountain. The Ordnance Survey accepts local tradition and names. However, it is generally agreed that the minimum height is 2,000ft (610m). When Sir George Everest measured Mount Everest, he found it was exactly 29,000ft high but he thought that no one would believe him so he recorded it as 29,002ft. Various subsequent measurings now have the mountain listed as 29,035ft high.","Snowdon is one metre taller than recognised by the Ordnance Survey (OS)

"Germany and Brussels are locked in a legal battle over benefits for migrants. EU mandarins have backed the case of a Romanian who was refused some payments because she had not been in the country long and was not seeking work. But German politicians say this encourages benefit tourism and risks turning their country into a ‘self-service store’ for migrants. Romanian immigrants gather on the streets of Duisburg. Leaked comments made by the EU commission to the European Court suggest Germany will be ordered to make it easier for migrants to claim benefits . When the 24-year-old Romanian – . identified only as Elizabeta D – arrived in 2010 she successfully . applied for child benefit for her son and for a single-parent grant. But . her application for ‘Hartz IV’ payments, which are targeted at the very . poor, was turned down because she was not trying to find a job. The . case went to a domestic court and was referred to the European Court of . Justice in Luxembourg. Leaked submissions from the Commission to the . court show it believes it is too difficult for immigrants to claim the . benefits – making a breach of EU law. Pressure: The revelations have sparked a furious outcry from one of Chancellor Merkel's most important coalition partners . The case, which is pending, has caused major ructions in the ruling coalition headed by Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. Their . coalition partners, the CSU, have accused the commission of ‘Eurocratic . madness’. It has called for a freeze on all  benefits for newcomers. Andreas . Scheuer, general secretary of the CSU, said: ‘The national social . security systems are not a self-service store for all those Europeans . who come to us. ‘It is shocking for me to see the EU Commission . torpedoing the national protection systems in this manner. If officials . want to intervene from their deluxe offices on our national social . security systems  then there will be bitter resistance from the CSU.’ Markus Ferber, a CSU MEP, said: ‘The national social security systems are and remain the responsibility of the nation states.’ The . case echoes political rows in the UK, which is also facing a series of . legal challenges from the EU over payments to migrants. A spokesman for the EU  Commission said its submissions had been misunderstood. ‘Insinuations . and accusations that the EU Commission urges Germany to pay social . security benefits to all unemployed citizens in the country are . completely wrong,’ she added. ‘There are strict safeguards in EU law to prevent so-called social tourism.’","Woman already getting child benefit and single parent .

"Now, a Maryland man says the photo, along with another overlooked one, is of President Abraham Lincoln's funeral procession less than two weeks after the leader was assassinated. Retired federal government accountant Paul Taylor believes the photos were taken on April 24 or 25, 1865 in front of Grace Episcopal Church, which still stands today on the corner of Broadway and E. 10th St. in Manhattan. A Maryland man claims this 1865 photo shows President Lincoln's funeral procession passing by Grace Episcopal Church in New York City with the horse-drawn caisson as a blur in the center . A second photograph taken the same day as the first one (above) appears to show a crowd in front of Grace Episcopal Church during Lincoln's funeral procession . Funeral processions were held across some American cities, including New York City, following Lincoln's assassination as a way for citizens to pay homage to their fallen leader. Adding more intrigue to the mystery is the fact that the photos were taken by the famous Civil War photographer Matthew Brady, who had a studio across the street from the church at the time. One of the photos shows a huge crowd in front of a church, some with heads bowed, as a blur in the center, presumably a funeral caisson, passes by. Men and women are dressed up, men with top hats and ladies with umbrellas shielding themselves from the sun's rays. A second photo shows a large crowd in front of the church, including some soldiers standing by. A confirmed photo showing a crowd in New York City's Union Square as President Lincoln's procession approaches . President Lincoln's body laid in state at City Hall in New York City for a day . 'It’s a big deal,' Sloan said. 'What makes it even a bigger deal is to be able to study the people. Even though you can’t see faces that well, just studying the people tells a story.' Officials at the National Archives, which has had possession of most of Matthew Brady's photographs since the 1940s, aren't so sure, saying there could be other explanations. One official said that if the photos were of such an historic event, then why was there no caption on the photos indicating so. This portrait of President Abraham Lincoln was taken four days before he was assassinated . Taylor actually found the photos in January while browsing through some Brady photographs on the Flickr photo-sharing site. 'I was just struck by the scene,'Taylor said. “That is not your normal scene in front of church. There’s just people everywhere: the streets, the sidewalks, the roof. They’re in the trees. This is not your normal Sunday.' After Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865 by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., the president's body spent 13 days by train on its way to the burial in Springfield, Illinois. Along the way, processions were held in cities that also included Baltimore and Philadelphia. When the procession was in New York, an estimated 500,000 people lined the route.","Photos taken in April 1865 by Civil War photographer Matthew Brady appear to show Lincoln's hearse going past Grace Episcopal Church .

"Before the Olympics began, Victoria Pendleton predicted confidently that London 2012 would become known as the 'girlie games'. What incredible foresight the British track cyclist showed. Her prophecy has come true in spectacular fashion, with GB's girls delivering many of the historic moments for which these Games will be forever remembered. From Jessica Ennis powering to gold in the heptathlon and Charlotte Dujardin's incredible elegance in the dressage, to the hurricane force of boxer Nicola Adams and the immense strength of character shown by our rowers, London 2012 has definitely been about our female athletes. Scroll down for interviews with the winners . Nicola Adams beat China's Cancan Ren to claim gold in the 51kg boxing category yesterday, at the time Britain's 24th gold of the Games .

Their . ten gold medals would put them level with Germany's overall tally and . ahead of France, Italy, Australia and Japan. Team GB's women have five times as many golds as Spain and Brazil, and more than those two nations combined with Japan. And this doesn't take into . consideration two of Britain's equestrian golds - the team dressage . winners were two-thirds female and the team eventing gold medallists . four-fifths. From orchestrating the beat-perfect . movement of the horses in the dressage to executing brutal kicks to the . head in taekwondo, Britain's women have delivered right across the spectrum of Olympic sports.

And Pendleton's heir apparent Laura .

Charlotte Dujardin pats her horse Valegro after a flawless six-minute dressage routine delivered her second gold medal of the Games yesterday . Dujardin had already won gold in the Team Dressage event two days earlier, alongside Carl Hester (centre) and Laura Bechtolsheimer (right) Perhaps the defining moment of British success at these Games arrived a few moments before 9pm on Saturday night, when Jessica Ennis, the poster girl of the British team, completed her heptathlon triumph before an adoring crowd in the Olympic Stadium. The sight of British athletes parading around a venue, smiling broadly and with the Union Jack fluttering behind them, before wiping away the mandatory tear on the medal podium, has become a delightfully common one. The glory has continued this week in three contrasting sports. Charlotte Dujardin and Laura Bechtolsheimer won gold in the dressage, an event of grace and elegance, while Nicola Adams and Jade Jones did likewise in boxing and taekwondo, sports of unbridled power and brute force. We have become so accustomed to . hearing 'God Save the Queen' during these Games that it would be easy to . forget the silver and bronze medals, but the female roll of honour goes . on and on. Rebecca Adlington has never finished . out of the medals in an Olympic event, though she wouldn't perhaps of . envisaged two bronze medals from her home Games. Lizzie Armitstead won our first . medal, a silver, in the women's road race - a few seconds of early drama . as three cyclists sprinted down The Mall which truly set the tone for . countless moments of Olympic theatre to come.

Helen Glover (left) and Heather Stanning ended Britain's gold drought in the women's pair final on Day Five of the Games . And further female success in the rowing came when Katherine Grainger (left) and Anna Watkins won the double sculls . Their performances drew gushing . praise from Lord Coe, who also pointed out that the London Olympics are . the first ever in which both men and women have been included in every . squad and participated in every sport. He added that the 2012 Games had continued the progress for women's sport made in the last London Games in 1948. 'I think that having 1948 with Fanny Blankers-Koen here really moved that argument for the presence of women in the Games. 'We've had more women competing in these Games (and) some of the big high-profile moments. 'If you look at this morning's media they are focusing on women.' He also praised the participation of . Sarah Attar who became one of the first women to represent Saudi Arabia . at the Olympics when she ran in the 800 metres. Her appearance followed months of . talks, with Saudi Olympic chiefs at one point insisting no women would . be allowed to take part. Lord Coe said she had 'really moved this agenda on in London' International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said: 'If you take, for example, 1984, only 24% of athletes were women. 'This Games, our provisional figure . is that this is just over 44%. So we are nearly at gender equality, . which is really good going.' But he added: 'Just getting all the . NOCs (National Olympic Committees) to send athletes is great, symbolic . and an important symbol, but that is not enough. 'We continue to push the NOCs and . work with the NOCs to provide sporting facilities for women, which is . challenging in some countries. So we will continue to work on that too.' Grainger and Watkins were congratulated by Prime Minister David Cameron at the London Studios this morning . Katherine Copeland and Sophie Hoskins picked up more precious metal in the lightweight double sculls final . And all this, just eight months after a BBC Sports Personality shortlist that didn't contain a single woman. There have been so many brilliant . successes that some pundits have wildly speculated there should be . separate awards for men and women. This is ridiculous - at least half of this year's shortlist will be female. But there is a prize far greater than . this - a generation of girls inspired by this roster of Olympic role . models to get involved in all manner of sports. They want to run, jump and throw like Jess, pedal like Pendleton and even punch like Adams. Sports clubs the length and breadth of the country are already being overwhelmed with new recruits. The Olympics has certainly captured the imagination - . witness the record 80,203 crowd at Wembley Stadium last night for the . women's football final - and the challenge now is to convert this . feel-good factor into Britain's Olympians of the future. Team GB is punching way above its weight in the Olympics, as shown by an interactive atlas which distorts the size of countries to reflect the number of medals won. A researcher at the University of St Andrews has created a map which displays the distribution of medals at London 2012. The online atlas continually updates to show how the medals are spread across the globe as well as the number of medals by population. When countries are reconfigured by population size, Britain swells considerably. This map, created by the University of St Andrews, shows the number of medals won in the Olympics so far for each country . The map shows how well nations are doing by their population size . The USA, predicted to win the most medals, appears smaller than usual and second-place favourites China shrinks to a fraction of its actual size because of its massive population. India is doing poorly considering its population size, while Slovenia and New Zealand are leading countries. The map is updated every hour and can be . viewed at www.st-andrews.ac.uk/geoinformatics.","Britain's female Olympians have won ten gold medals, the same number as Germany .

"Verdict: An inquest has found that Shane Todd, a high-tech researcher who died in Singapore in June, 2012, killed himself . An American engineer who was found dead in his apartment in Singapore last year killed himself and was not murdered, a coroner ruled today. Shane Todd, 31, was found dead in his apartment in Singapore by his girlfriend in June 2012. A Singapore state coroner has ruled Dr Todd had committed suicide, but his family believe that he was murdered because of research into sensitive technology. But the U.S. Embassy has described the inquest into Shane Truman Todd's death as fair and comprehensive. It comes weeks after Dr Todd's parents walked out of the hearings, saying they had lost faith in the process. Singapore's foreign minister said the ruling was based on 'incontrovertible evidence'. State counsel presented evidence of links to suicide websites on his laptop and suicide letters written to family members and loved ones. Judge Chay Yuen Fatt said he found no evidence of foul play, ruling that Dr Todd 'committed suicide by hanging himself'. Chay recorded the official cause of death as 'asphyxia due to hanging' and voiced hopes that Mr Todd's family and loved ones would be able to find closure. Dr Todd's parents have said they believe he may have been murdered over his research in the U.S. into material used to make heat-resistant semiconductors, a technology with both civilian and military applications. Statement: Singapore's Foreign Minister K Shanmugam said the inquest verdict was based on 'clear, incontrovertible evidence' Witness: Shane's girlfriend Shirley Sarmiento (center on May 14 with the Todd family) testified at the inquest into the 31-year-old death . Warning: Shane Todd's father Rick said his son . had become fearful for his safety due to the sensitive technological . research he was engaged in . Rick and Mary Todd left Singapore in May before the inquest ended. They said they believed the evidence of suicide was faked and that officials had not followed protocol in the investigation, including in how they accessed Dr Todd's computers and examined the location of his death. Singaporean authorities have denied the claims. Mary Todd, speaking from her home state of Montana, said that 'today's result means nothing to us because we expected it'. Her husband said last week the family no longer trusts Singapore's legal system. 'It was apparent that the state was only interested in proving suicide and that was why we left,' Rick Todd wrote in an email. The U.S. Embassy in Singapore said in a statement that the inquiry had been 'comprehensive, fair and transparent'. It said embassy officers had attended the entire hearing, and that the Dr Todd family had been given the opportunity to participate in the hearing and was represented by experienced legal counsel. It expressed sympathy to Dr Todd's family and friends for their loss. Shane Todd's family lawyer, Gloria James, centre, outside the Subordinate courts in Singapore today after a coroner ruled the engineer committed suicide and was not murdered as his family claims . Tragic: Shane Todd, a high-tech researcher, was found hanged in his apartment in Singapore in June 2012. His parents believe he was murdered due to the sensitive research he was involved in . Family: Shane Todd's brothers John (left), Dylan (second from left), Chet (second from right) and his sister-in-law Corynne (right) had traveled to Singapore this May to attend the inquest . K Shanmugam, Singapore's minister for law and foreign affairs, said the city-state had cooperated with U.S. authorities, including the FBI, and acted according to the law 'to get to the truth'. 'The verdict is clear, Dr. Todd committed suicide and that conclusion was based on clear, incontrovertible evidence,' Shanmugam told reporters. 'Many of us are parents and can understand the family's grief. At the same time, we need the strength to face the truth and not make fictional and untrue statements.' Dr Todd's parents said documents he had backed up from his work computer included a draft of a project outline between Singapore's Institute of Microelectronics - Shane Todd's former employer - and Chinese telecom giant Huawei on the development of a device that utilized gallium nitride. The heat-resistant material has civilian uses in products like LED screens and cellphone towers, and military applications possibly for radar and satellite systems. Huawei and Singapore officials have said they did not proceed beyond initial discussions into a possible project involving gallium nitride. The Institute of Microelectronics has said neither Todd nor the company was involved in any classified research. Enough: Rick and Mary Todd believe their son was murdered last year in Singapore. They withdrew from the inquest, saying they have no confidence in the city-state's legal process .

"After the conservative papacy of his predecessor Benedict XVI, Catholics were unsure what changes, if any, Francis would bring. In the first year and a half of his reign he has changed the way the Vatican Bank is run. Now it seems, he is about to overhaul a number of social dogmas that the Church has held for many years. Scroll down for video . The 77-year-old Holy Father seems determined to shake up the Church of 1.2 billion people that he leads . Around 200 bishops are arriving in Rome this weekend for an 'extraordinary synod' that begins tomorrow to discuss subjects such as marriage, divorce and cohabitation. The discussions beforehand have already caused bitter arguments among senior clergy. The 77-year-old Holy Father seems determined to shake up the Church of 1.2 billion people that he leads. Pope Francis realises that a number of the Church's strict teachings are at odds with the lives lived by many of the faithful in the developed world. 'There's a strong sense in which on this whole question of sexuality, marriage and family, the Church stands out against contemporary mores – and some people don't like to live in that tension,' Austen Ivereigh, a Catholic journalist and author of an upcoming book on Pope Francis, called The Great Reformer tells the Financial Times. 'But what conservative cardinals are saying is that if you concede ground on this, you are conceding to the culture, and that it is a slippery slope.' Cardinal Walter Kasper of Germany, a close ally of the Pope, has proposed allowing the divorced and remarried to take Holy Communion, something presently banned in the Church. The Church does not recognise divorces dispensed by civil courts and thus regards people who have remarried as adulterers. Pope Francis realises that many of the Church's strict teachings are at odds with the lives lived by many of the faithful in the developed world . However, conservative Catholic officials are totally opposed to this move believing that it is a threat to the principle of the 'indissolubility' of marriage. U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke, Cardinal Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, Australia's Cardinal George Pell, the current Prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy and Germany's Cardinal Gerhard Muller, the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, are all opposed to any change in who can take Communion. Although there have often been divisions and disagreements within the Vatican, it is unusual for them to be aired so publicly. As yet the Holy Father has not made his final decision on any of these matters and nothing is likely to change until at least 2016 after another meeting of bishops. Many believe that when a decision is taken Francis will side with the reformers. 'What Francis wants to see is a church that comes alongside those who have been wounded by marital breakdowns. He wants to see it as a place of healing – not of rigidity and judgment,' Mr Ivereigh said.","Pope Francis is believed to want the Church reformers to succeed .

"A Thai diplomat has been summoned to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to be told about the UK's concerns over his country's handling of the investigation into the murders of two British backpackers. FCO minister Hugo Swire told Thai charge d'affaires Nadhavathna Krishnamra there was 'a real concern' in the UK over the way in which the deaths of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have been dealt with. Mr Swire said it was crucial for the Thai authorities to investigate the killings in a 'fair and transparent way' and keep the victims' families up to date with progress. Scroll down for video . Hannah Witheridge (left) and David Miller (right) were murdered while backpacking in Thailand in September but the Foreign Office is concerned about the way the Thai authorities have handled the investigation . He also voiced concern about the way Thai police had engaged with the media. Two Burmese workers who have been charged with the killings were paraded in front of the cameras after apparently making confessions, which were reportedly later withdrawn. The men, named in reports as bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, are accused of the brutal murders of Miss Witheridge, 23, from Great Yarmouth, and 24-year-old Mr Miller, from Jersey, on the holiday island of Koh Tao in September.

The two suspects, both 21, were charged with three offences - conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery. But later reports - denied by the Thai police - suggested that a Burmese embassy official had formally retracted their confessions amid allegations the pair were tortured.

"How would Louis van Gaal defend this humiliating result? All eyes and ears were fixed on the Dutchman as he strode into the John Ruddy Suite at the Abbey Stadium for his post-match press conference. The room certainly isn't what Van Gaal is used to. Small, tight - and adjacent to a gym weights room. Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after Manchester United's draw with Cambridge United . Van Gaal watches on while Manchester United face Cambridge on Friday night in the FA Cup . CLICK HERE to read Matt Barlow's report from the Abbey Stadium as Manchester United and Cambridge United drew 0-0 in their FA Cup clash. He's certainly spoken in plusher surroundings. But that summed up United's night. They aren't used to results like this. So why were a side that included Radamel Falcao and Angel Di Maria unable to break down a side playing three levels below them in the English football spectrum? Van Gaal provided a bullish response: 'Every aspect of this match was against us. 'What do I mean? We have to come here, the pitch isn't so good - that can influence the style you play. 'The opponents always give a lot more than they normally give and defending is always easier than attacking. 'We knew in advance everything would be against us - but you have to survive. 'And then you have seen the referee - its always the same. Everywhere I have coached these games, and I have coached them with other clubs, it's always the same. 'What was wrong with the referee? You can give your own opinion, I can't give mine.' Van Gaal walks from the pitch at full time frustrated after his side drew 0-0 against Cambridge United . Angel di Maria struggled to impress for Manchester United against Cambridge United . That could well be because there was nothing wrong with referee Chris Foy's performance. Van Gaal's comments were, of course, a deliberate ploy to deflect attention away from his side's inept display. Had he heard some of the views of United supporters leaving the Abbey Stadium following the final whistle, then Van Gaal may have been harsher on his charges. The Dutchman didn't let his players off the hook completely, though. 'We made the same mistakes as we did against Yeovil and Queens Park Rangers in that we played in the same style as the opponent and that was our error. 'In the second half we played much better, we played along the floor. 'So it's a pity, again, that we had to wait till half time, but in the second half I was pleased, we didn't score but I have to give credit to Cambridge. 'They played very well and were well organised, with heart, and they fought until the end. 'We could have scored but now we have an extra match, we are still in the cup and that's the most important thing. 'I have seen a lot of times that big clubs lose against such opponents.' Radamel Falcao had a another frustrating night in a Manchester United shirt against Cambridge . Cameron McGeehan (left) of Cambridge United  tackles Michael Carrick of Manchester United . And then came the perennial questions about his choice of formation. He knew it was coming too, as a wry smile came across Van Gaal's face. United reverted to a flat back four after starting last weekend's win over QPR with three-at-the back. Van Gaal said: 'Do you watch our games? Against Yeovil, we played the other system and in the second half we played 4-4-2,' said the United boss. 'So when it’s not going well I change, and we won 2-0. Queens Park Rangers was the same, we played the other system and changed to 4-4-2 (and won). 'We created more chances and so you are more convinced. I know the statistics of the other performances and you can see we created more chances. 'But it’s not only the system, it’s the performance of the system.' There was a much more enthusiastic mood during Van Gaal's counterpart, Richard Money's, press conference. Money is, perhaps, an appropriate name for last night. His side's heroics could earn Cambridge upwards of £1.7million from their replay at Old Trafford the week after next. Cambridge United boss Richard Money watching on during his side's draw against Manchester United . Man-of-the-match Ryan Donaldson and team-mate Tom Champion celebrating at full time . 'It's going to be a massive amount of money, I can't think about to be honest,' said Money. 'I'm sure the chairman wouldn't have been happy if we scored. I've just said in the dressing room we are going to Old Trafford, so who cares what happens. 'Enjoy soak it in, 75,000 people, whatever happens happens. It’s hard to put into words how proud we are. 'This club has been in the doldrums with 10 years out of the Football League, and now we’re taking everybody back to Old Trafford. 'In the second half we showed great character and courage, but in the first half we were good and carried a threat. 'We had a couple of good set pieces and couldn’t quite produce the final touch. 'I must put in a special word for the goalkeeper and two centre halves, who were terrific. 'We spent a lot of time before kick-off making them aware who the players were, giving them a good look at the Man United badge. 'I told them to stick their chests out, and go out and play - not to be fazed.'","Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria unable to break down Cambridge .

"New details of intimate texts exchanged between David Cameron and disgraced media boss Rebekah Brooks have been obtained by The Mail on Sunday. In one message, the Prime Minister thanks the former News International chief for letting him ride one of her family's horses, saying it was 'fast, unpredictable and hard to control but fun'. In another, a gushing Mrs Brooks tells Mr Cameron that she felt so emotional listening to his Tory conference speech she 'cried twice', adding: 'Will love ""working together"".' In close touch: Rebekah Brooks (left) pictured on the pone with her husband Charlie Brooks (right) The messages, with their horseplay tone, are part of a cache of texts and emails handed over to Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry into media ethics by Downing Street and Mrs Brooks. Only a very small number of the messages have so far been made public, leading to claims of a cover-up by No 10 and the inquiry. A furious Mr Cameron rejected a Commons demand by Labour MP Chris Bryant two weeks ago to  disclose all the texts and emails exchanged with Mrs Brooks, the former chief executive of Rupert Murdoch's News International, which is at the centre of the phone hacking scandal. Her husband, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, is an Old Etonian chum of the Prime Minister. Mr Bryant suggested Mr Cameron's refusal was because the messages were 'too salacious and embarrassing for you'. He rounded on the Prime Minister: 'When the truth comes out, you won't be smiling.' When livid Mr Cameron refused to reply, Mr Bryant, himself a phone hacking victim, accused the Prime Minister of a 'hissy fit'. To add to the intrigue, Mr Bryant claims to have had contact with a No 10 'mole' involved in compiling Mr Cameron's texts and emails, whom the MP says has confirmed their 'salacious' nature. Cosy: Rebekah Brooks (right) was in close contact with the Prime Minister David Cameron . The Mail on Sunday obtained details of two embarrassing texts exchanged between Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks, who awaits trial next year on charges of phone hacking and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Both texts were sent in October 2009, shortly after Mrs Brooks left her job as editor of The Sun and became chief executive of News International, which owns the paper. In one, Mr Cameron writes: 'The horse CB [Charlie Brooks] put me on. Fast, unpredictable and hard to control but fun.' He signed off 'DC.' Embarrassing: The newly leaked messages sent by Rebekah Brooks and David Cameron . Admission: David Cameron, pictured at a party with Mrs Brooks in 2009, was embroiled in the controversy surrounding the Met Police lending a horse to the ex-News of the World editor . In another, sent after his speech to . the Tory conference, Mrs Brooks said: 'Brilliant speech. I cried twice. Will love “working together.” ' They . shed further light on the extraordinarily close relationship between Mr . Cameron and Mrs Brooks, both members of the so-called 'Chipping Norton . set' based around their Oxfordshire homes. Mrs . Brooks told the Leveson Inquiry earlier this year that Mr Cameron . signed some of his missives to her 'LOL' – until she told him it meant . 'Laugh Out Loud,' not 'Lots Of Love'. Horseplay: The texts were about a police horse, this one pictured on duty . The light-hearted tone of Mr Cameron's leaked text echoes the way he reportedly congratulated Mr Brooks when he started his relationship with Mrs Brooks, saying: 'You'd better not mess this one up, Charlie. It's the most important ride of your life.' Today's fresh disclosures are bound to lead to further Labour demands that all messages between the pair are made public so the true nature of their relationship can be seen. Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks met 22 times in a six-year period, an average of once every three months. Mrs Brooks said that at the height of the phone hacking scandal he sent her a morale-boosting 'keep your head up' message, and expressed his regret he could not be more loyal to her in public. Mr Cameron has gone out of his way to play down his connection with 44-year-old Mrs Brooks. He was caught out when it was revealed he had ridden a retired police horse, Raisa, lent to Mrs Brooks by the Metropolitan Police. The disclosure came amid claims that News International paid backhanders to police while pressuring them not to investigate phone-hacking. The Prime Minister spent days trying to deny having ridden  Raisa, but eventually admitted  it and was forced to make a grovelling apology – in the middle of  an EU summit – for trying to  conceal the fact. It seems unlikely Mr Cameron was referring to Raisa in the newly leaked text, as the horse was 22 years old when lent to Mrs Brooks by the Metropolitan Police in 2008 and would have been put down otherwise. The animal is now dead. The 'horsegate' saga was not the first time Mr Cameron had tried to cover up his horse-riding exploits with the Brooks. The Mail on Sunday was told as far back as 2010 that he had been riding with Mr Brooks. The Prime Minister's then head of communications, Andy Coulson, issued a flat denial and this newspaper dropped the story. Mr Coulson, who had succeeded Mrs Brooks as editor of the News Of The World before being appointed by Mr Cameron, was forced to quit No 10 in January 2011 over the phone hacking scandal. He now faces criminal charges, too. It is believed the Leveson Inquiry also has unpublished texts and emails between Mr Cameron and Mr Coulson. Lord Justice Leveson ordered Mr Cameron and Mrs Brooks to send a vast amount of  correspondence, including emails and texts, to the inquiry, but only a small number were published. 'I am so rooting for you tomorrow and not . just as a personal friend but because  professionally we're definitely . in this together.' Mrs Brooks . The inquiry's lead QC, Robert Jay, said he would only use 'relevant' texts and emails. The new leaked texts are believed to have been supplied to the inquiry by Mrs Brooks. Among the texts disclosed during the inquiry was one sent by Mrs Brooks to Mr Cameron on the eve  of his Tory conference speech in October 2009. In it, she gushed: 'I am so rooting for you tomorrow and not just as a personal friend but because  professionally we're definitely in this together.' Referring to another issue, she said: 'Let's discuss over country  supper soon.' It concluded, excruciatingly, 'Speech of your life? Yes  he Cam!' Crucially, the first line of the text, said to be 'humorous', was not read out on the grounds it was 'not relevant'. The two texts published today by The Mail on Sunday were not revealed either. Mrs Brooks's 'I cried twice' text, was sent immediately after the speech, in which Mr Cameron spoke movingly of the death of his  disabled son, Ivan. The Prime Minister's text about riding one of her husband's 'fast, uncontrollable' horses was in the same month. A No 10 spokesman said: 'The PM has always been happy to comply with whatever Lord Justice Leveson has asked of him.' An insider said: 'These new texts are of no great significance.' A spokesman for Lord Justice Leveson said: 'We have no comment.'  A well-placed inquiry source added: 'Only communications deemed relevant will be published.' Mrs Brooks declined to comment.","Messages from a cache of texts and emails handed over to Leveson inquiry .

The American posted this montage on Instagram of Manny Pacquiao on the canvas and wrote: 'Miss Pac Man is broke and desperate for a pay day' Earlier this month Mayweather defeated Marcos Maidana via unanimous decision in Las Vegas . The self-proclaimed 'TBE' (The Best Ever) followed up his appearance at the hearing by posting a picture of himself in bed, listening to music alongside $1million in cash. And with typical modesty, the boxer commented on his lifestyle, 'Is there such thing as private jet sky mile points?' The champion  had to explain to boxing regulators last week that his reality TV show was nearly all made up . Mayweather then posted an instagram picture with himself and $1million,  claiming he wants to sell a lifestyle .","Floyd Mayweather flew to the French capital for Paris Fashion Week .

"The advert for a 'customer-facing passenger assistant' has been criticised as 'gobbledegook' (file picture) The job adverts for a ‘passenger . assistant’ stressed that a ‘good face-to-face communicator’ was required . who must have ‘customer-facing experience’. Not to mention having a ‘natural flair for going the extra mile’ and being fit enough to stand for lengthy periods. In other words, a bus conductor. Candidates were further informed that . they would work on a ‘unique’ new double-decker bus which was . ‘accessible’ and ‘convenient’ and asked if they had ‘the kind of . personality that made last year’s Olympic gamesmakers so successful’. The Plain English Campaign – which promotes concise writing – summed up the ads as ‘gobbledegook’. A spokesman said: ‘What seems like a . great idea is certainly getting lost in translation here. “Wanted – . helpful bus conductor” would seem a lot clearer.’ The Go-Ahead London bus company placed . the ads in newspapers and on the internet. ‘The primary role of the . passenger assistant is to travel the length of the route and ensure that . passengers board and alight the bus safely,’ said an online . description. ‘As part of the role it’s your . responsibility to be visible to passengers by patrolling both the lower . and upper deck and be proactive in assisting with general inquiries.’ The advert calls for applicants with the 'same kind of personality' as the London 2012 gamesmakers . The Plain English spokesman added: . ‘The prospective clippie must now undertake “routine patrols” and be a . “visible presence” – which of course makes us wonder what fun it would . be to be an invisible presence instead.’ A Go-Ahead London spokesman said: ‘We have reviewed our advert and are happy with the content. ‘The advert has been successful and has generated a very large number of applications.’ Boris Johnson previously won an award for his 'cyclised city' comment . NHS Trusts, councils, politicians and even sportspeople have been mocked by The Plain English Campaign for their awkward use of English. The organisation holds an annual awards for the most baffling and awkward statements. Last year, NHS North Staffordshire, was awarded the dubious honour for this baffling response to a bid to open a new pharmacy at Madeley Surgery. It wrote: 'There was not currently a gap on the spectrum of adequacy sufficient to conclude that the provision of pharmaceutical services is not currently secured to the standard of adequacy,' the committee explained as it rejected the application. NHS Tayside also won an award after it reported that it planned to adopt a 'dashboard approach to performance reporting and assurance'. Mitt Romney, the defeated Republican Presidential candidate, was named as the winner of the 'Foot in Mouth' award for spoken gibberish after regularly tying himself in knots during the US election campaign. In one particularly confusing episode, he told voters: 'I believe in an America where millions of Americans believe in an America that's the America millions of Americans believe in. That's the America I love.' Previous winners have included Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who called for London to become 'a cyclised city'. In 2010, Former Liverpool and England player Redknapp won the Foot in Mouth Award for his incorrect use of the word 'literally' and other gaffes. Examples included: 'These balls now - they literally explode off your feet.' And: 'Steven Gerrard makes runs into the box better than anyone. So does Frank Lampard.'","Plain English Campaign criticised The Go-Ahead group for the advert .

"There wasn't a shirtfront in sight. Prime Minister Tony Abbott today greeted Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 Leader's Summit in Brisbane with a smile, a handshake - and a few pointed fingers. Mr Abbott, as the host of the 2014 summit, was officially welcoming all leaders to the Brisbane Convention and Entertainment Centre at Southbank. The pair chatted briefly and Mr Putin made various gestures throughout the conversation. Scroll down for video . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Russian President Vladimir Putin exchanged smiles and awkward finger-pointing when they met at the G20 Summit in Brisbane today ... but there was no 'shirt-fronting' Their apparently amiable conversation appeared at odds with recent statements and actions by the two leaders. Tensions have ratcheted up between Australia and Russia since the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 earlier this year, which killed 38 Australians.

Mr Putin was subjected to a diplomatic snub on Friday evening when Mr Abbott's government sent a low-ranking MP, the assistant defence minister Stuart Robert, to greet Mr Putin at the airport. The snub followed controversy over Mr Putin's deployment of a small fleet of four Russian vessels to the Queensland coast. Commentators dubbed the move a 'shipfront' to Mr Abbott. The pair recently had a conversation at the APEC meeting in Beijing, where Mr Abbott said he told the Russian leader not to attempt to 'recreate the lost glories' of its history. 'One of the points I tried to make to Putin is that Russia would be so much more attractive if it was aspiring to be a superpower for peace and freedom and prosperity... instead of trying to recreate the lost glories of Tsarism or the old Soviet Union,' Mr Abbott told reporters. U.S. President Barack Obama also took a potshot at Mr Putin's administration in a landmark speech on Australian soil today. Mr Obama said America 'shares Australia's grief' over the destruction of MH17, and said the incident was 'appalling'. To your seats:  In what has been called a 'diplomatic snub', Mr Abbott's government sent a low-ranking MP to greet Mr Putin at the airport on Friday evening . Shipfront?

"The last of the living Medal of Honor recipients that stormed Omaha Beach on D-Day in the battle immortalized in 'Saving Private Ryan' has died. Staff Sergeant Walter Ehlers, 92, of Buena Park, CA., earned the nation’s highest honor and multiple other medals for his heroic actions during the taking of the small sliver of French beach from German soldiers. He also received three purple hearts and a silver star, according to NBC News. An American hero: Walter Ehlers, a Medal of Honor recipient who took part in the D-Day invasion of World War II, has died at age 92 . Ehlers was awarded the Medal of Honor ‘for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty’ on June 9 and 10, 1944, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. He ‘repeatedly led his men against heavily defended enemy strong points exposing himself to deadly hostile fire whenever the situation required heroic and courageous leadership.’ Ehlers heroically defended his unit from ‘withering machine gun fire’ and mortars, personally killing at least seven Nazi soldiers, taking out multiple enemy positions and even carrying a wounded soldier back across enemy lines to safety despite being shot in the back himself. He then went back through the hail of bullets to retrieve a US Army-issued automatic rifle which he had to previously leave behind to carry the rifleman to safety.

Immortalized: Walter Ehlers' Medal of Honor, awarded for his actions during World War II, is shown in 2011 in his home in Buena Park, California . Ehlers refused to leave his unit after being treated for his bullet wound upon returning and continued to lead his squad deeper into France. When asked if the ‘Saving Private Ryan’ depiction of US soldiers storming Omaha Beach was as bad as he saw, Ehlers said being there ‘was worse,’ according to the Orange County Breeze. ‘The Germans didn't leave much of me untouched,’ Ehlers said an interview with WWII Magazine in 2012, according to NBC. His post-war life saw him become a stern advocate for veteran’s benefits and work as a security guard at Disneyland, in Anaheim, from the day it opened, NBC noted. He also has a local community center named after him and had a postage stamp issued in his honor. One of the ‘Greatest Generation,’ Ehlers is survived by his wife Dorothy, three children, 11 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.","Staff Sergeant Walter Ehlers was part of the raid on Nazi troops at Omaha Beach battle immortalized in the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan'

"Lawsuit: Jill Kelley from Tampa Bay, Florida, claims the FBI and Defense Department violated her privacy when officials leaked information about her to the media . A Florida socialite has been told she can pursue a lawsuit which claims the government invaded her privacy during the scandal over former CIA director David Petraeus. Jill Kelley from Tampa Bay, Florida, received global media attention for triggering the investigation that revealed the intelligence chief was having an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell. But she claims the FBI and Defense Department violated her privacy when officials leaked damaging information about her to the media. In 2012, Kelley, who has friends in military circles, complained to the bureau when an anonymous individual sent her harassing emails. Her concerns triggered an investigation that led agents to Broadwell, who was romantically involved with the married Petraeus at the time. However, after a search of her emails, the bureau publicly announced that she had ‘inappropriate’ email conversations with General John Allen - even though she is married. She claims that agents deliberately leaked her name to the public and then released the correspondences  to insinuate an affair between them and smear her name. According to NBC, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson yesterday said she can now sue the government officials in a move that could reveal more information about the scandal that unfolded two years ago. Court filings by her lawyers claim the government falsely told one news outlet the emails between Allen and Kelley were the equivalent of phone sex. Mrs Kelley went into hiding as the allegations were disclosed. She has only recently spoken out about how she feels it was unjust for her to be forced into a defensive position even though she believes she did nothing wrong. All of the parties involved in the tumultuous scandal- Petraeus, Broadwell, Allen and Kelley - were all married to other people, but Kelley claims that Petraeus and Broadwell were the only two that had a romantic relationship. Revelations: When Kelley complained to the FBI about a person sending emails to her, the investigation which led to David Petraeus' (right) biographer, Paula Broadwell, who was having an affair with him . Mrs Kelley, with her cancer surgeon husband Scott at her side, fought back against the federal government for releasing her name in connection to the Broadwell investigation and further insinuating an inappropriate connection to General Allen. She served as a volunteer civilian liaison to MacDill Air Force Base, where Petreaus and his wife had been stationed when he served as head of the military's Central Command. Petreaus struck up a friendship with Kelley, but Broadwell feared he was having an affair with her, as well. The married intelligence chief resigned from his position as Director of the CIA in November 2012, citing his extramarital affair.

"At just 19-years old and stunningly beautiful, straight-A chemistry student Alyssa Funke took her own life weeks after she dabbled in the seedy world of amateur porn and was mercilessly taunted for her decision. Miss Funke, who wanted to be an anesthesiologist, decided to take part in a sex video with a stranger in Las Vegas for website CastingCouch-X, using the name 'Stella Ann'. Days after the sex tape of the teenager, from Stillwater, Minnesota, was posted online in March, abusive messages flooded her social media accounts, many from her former schoolmates at Stillwater High. Scroll down for video . Straight-A chemistry student Alyssa Funke, 19, from Miinnesota, took her own life two weeks after she dabbled in amateur porn and was mercilessly taunted for it . The messages, ranged from gossipy and sarcastic to nasty slurs about the University of Wisconsin student. High school students had reportedly gathered around tables in the cafeteria to watch the teen's sex tape on their cellphones, according to KMSP-TV. One called Miss Funke a 'thot', a slang word for prostitute, adding: 'Does her dad know?' Another message sniped: 'Nothing brings a school together like a porn star who graduated last year.' Miss Funke fought back - defending herself. She tweeted: 'Pornstar status' and 'FAMOUS for dayzzzzz.' The last message she posted on Facebook on March 4 read: 'The people that envy & hate you the most, stalk you on social media the most so, hey hi hello how r u doing, this ones for you.' She wrote a post to her 'future husband' and about vulnerable message about wanting a relationship where you 'never feel unwanted or alone'. Funke went to Las Vegas for her interview with CastingCouch-X in March where she called herself Stella Ann. She appeared nervous on the tape and talked about her real dreams of becoming an anesthesiologist . During her interview for the amateur porn site in March, Alyssa Funke, who called herself 'Ann' looked nervous and described her college plans and described her childhood as 'pretty much normal' The 19-year-old did not know the easiest of childhoods, despite describing her past with a shrug in her porn video interview as 'pretty much' normal. Her biological father Rashad Bowman was jailed in 2001 for fraud in Maricopa County, Arizona. Court records show that as a young girl, Alyssa tried to keep in contact with her father using audio tapes. Her mother and a boyfriend were charged with drug-dealing. Family told KMSP-TV that the teenager had money worries and struggled with depression. Despite brushing off the taunts from her peers, the words affected her, family said. On April 17, the teenager bought a shotgun, drove to Big Carnelia Lake and killed herself on her family's boat. The teenage college student had a troubled upbringing with her father in jail in Arizona and her mother and a boyfriend arrested for dealing drugs . Her devastated family, who have been unwilling to speak publicly on her tragic death, launched The Alyssa Stop Bullying Fund, which has so far raised just $165. On the site, a family message reads: 'On Wednesday April 16, at the young age of 19 Alyssa Funke took her . own life. Alyssa like so many other teens was a victim of bully and . sadly the bullying lead to her death.' According to KMSP-TV, Miss Funke's video remains on their website. Attempts to contact the site have so far been unsuccessful. The local sheriff's office is investigating the teenager's death but does not believe that the messages sent to Miss Funke amount to criminal harassment. Miss Funke's story draws similarities with Duke student Miriam Weeks, 18, who was outed as porn star Belle Knox earlier this year and also sat on the same Vegas couch for CastingCouch-X. Miss Knox, a women's studies major, made headlines earlier this year when one of her classmates outed her secret life as a porn star to the student body. Since then, she has defended her decision to enter the adult film world on Piers Morgan Live, The View and other talk shows.

"A man has been arrested after an attempt was made to steal a statue of Eric Morecambe, the late comedian. Police were called to Marine Road Central in Morecambe at about noon today following reports that the statue had been damaged. Lancashire Constabulary said it is thought that someone attempted to cut through one of the legs of the statue. Scroll down for video . The statue of Eric Morecambe was sawn off at the ankle as someone attempted to steal it . The council has now removed the statue and the area has been fenced off. The statue is a popular tourist attraction with many posing for photographs next to it in the Bring Me Sunshine pose. The statue of comedy legend Eric Morecambe before it was vandalised this morning . Mark Cullinan, the chief executive of Lancaster City Council, told the Morecambe Visitor: 'When we got to the site it was clear someone had sawed through most of Eric's leg and then left him like that. When we inspected it we knew we couldn't repair it at the site. 'We're removing him in a van and taking him to a safe and secure place, and will work with the sculptor to get him back as soon as possible. 'Already we've seen some anger from tourists and local people, and I think the general feeling is one of disbelief.' Graham Ibbeson, the sculptor of the statue, called it a 'moronic act'. Cllr Tracy Brown, from Morecambe Town Council, said: 'We have a very large supportive community trying to move Morecambe forward with carnivals, festivals and creative ideas. 'People put hours of voluntary time into lifting this town to a better future. We have been let down by this disrespectful act to our community.' The statue of Eric Morecambe faced towards the town where the comic was born and away from the sea . Her Majesty the Queen unveils the statue on the promenade at Morecambe on July 23, 1999 . It was awarded a Certificate of Excellence by TripAdvisor this year due to outstanding feedback from the website's users. The vandalism of the statue prompted a swift response on Twitter. The British Comedy Society tweeted: 'We're very distressed to hear this news. What an awful thing to have happened.' The official Morecambe FC Twitter feed said: 'Unbelievable that the Eric Morecambe statue has been vandalised. Let's get him back where he belongs. #Legend', while Morecambe and Lunesdale MP David Morris tweeted: 'Awful news of vandalism of the Eric Morecambe statue. I hope that the council can get the statue back up on the promenade where it belongs.' Only the statue's standing foot remains after the rest of it was placed face down in the back of a council van and driven away for repairs. A 32-year-old man from Morecambe has been arrested on suspicion of attempted theft and remains in custody. It was John Eric Bartholomew's mother Sadie who pushed her son into showbusiness when he was a youngster and Sadie who linked him up with young Ernest Wiseman, six months his senior in 1941. Apart from war service the two were together as a double act until Eric's death in 1984. The duo – now Morecambe & Wise – learned their trade in the music halls up and down the country until radio and TV beckoned. Their first television show, Running Wild in 1954, was not a success and one critic even wrote 'Definition of the week: TV set—the box in which they buried Morecambe and Wise.' The duo's famous dance was based on one performed by Groucho Marx in the film Horse Feathers . Seven years later at ITV they launched Two of a Kind with writers Dick Hills and Sid Green. In 1968, they were signed to the BBC where after one series Hills & Green left and the boys hired Eddie Braben to write their shows. It was Braben who introduced their 'personalities' with Ernie a miser with short fat hairy legs, and the 'plays wot [he] wrote'. He also had them sharing a bed. Eric was concerned that people might think they were a gay couple, hence he always smoked a pipe in the bedroom scenes. Braben silenced his criticism by pointing out if it was good enough for Laurel & Hardy to share a bed, it would be good enough for Morecambe & Wise. Braben along with producer John Ammonds and choreographer Ernest Maxin (who succeeded Ammonds as producer) made the duo the best-loved comedy pairing of the Seventies. It was a huge honour for celebrities to appear on The Morecambe & Wise Show, especially the Christmas special and among them were Dame Flora Robson, Penelope Keith, Laurence Olivier, Sir John Mills, Vanessa Redgrave, Eric Porter, Sir Harold Wilson, Angela Rippon, Dame Shirley Bassey, Ian Carmichael, Fenella Fielding, André Previn ('Mr Preview'), Peter Cushing (who in a running joke would keep turning up to complain that he had not been paid for an earlier appearance) and Frank Finlay as well as Glenda Jackson (as Cleopatra: 'All men are fools. And what makes them so is having beauty like what I have got...'). Eric Morecambe never liked the bed scenes with Ernie Wise, lest viewers thought them a gay couple . In 1976, they were both awarded the OBE. Their theme tune was Bring Me Sunshine and their famous dance was based on one performed by Groucho Marx in the film Horse Feathers. Eric suffered from heart trouble and had his first coronary on November 8, 1968 when he was 42. Although he recovered, it was always feared he would have another and thus it was on May 28, 1984, two weeks after his 58th birthday, he died after taking part in a show hosted by his close friend and comedian Stan Stennett at the Roses Theatre in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. Ernie Wise died in 1999. On July 23, 1999 the Queen unveiled the statue of Eric on the promenade at Morecambe.","Police called at noon today following reports the statue had been vandalised .

"At least 20 migrants are feared dead off the coast of Libya, in the latest boat tragedy to blight the Mediterranean. The news follows a decision by the UK not to support the rescue of those at risk of drowning during crossings to Europe. The Italian coast guard saved 93 would-be immigrants after their boat capsized but they said there were 113 on board in total. At least 20 migrants are feared dead off the coast of Libya, in the latest boat tragedy to blight the Mediterranean (file picture) Italy, the gateway for tens of thousands seeking a new life in Europe, has been running a major search and rescue operation called Mare Nostrum following a boat disaster off the island of Lampedusa last year in which more than 300 migrants drowned. This year alone 150,000 migrants have arrived on Italian shores by boat while around 3,000 are estimated to have drowned making the crossing. A joint EU rescue migrant rescue mission is due to start this weekend in the Mediterranean but will have just a third of the funding of the previous Italian mission and will only patrol close to shore. The British government has refused to contribute saying that the rescues only encourage more people to attempt the crossing. Italy has been running a search and rescue operation following a boat disaster off the island of Lampedusa (pictured) last year in which more than 300 migrants drowned . A Home Office spokesman said: 'Ministers across Europe have expressed concerns that search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean have acted as a pull factor for illegal migration, encouraging people to make dangerous crossings in the expectation of rescue. 'This has led to more deaths as traffickers have exploited the situation using boats that are unfit to make the crossing.' Foreign Office minister Baroness Anelay said: 'The government believes the most effective way to prevent refugees and migrants attempting this dangerous crossing is to focus our attention on countries of origin and transit, as well as taking steps to fight the people smugglers who willfully put lives at risk by packing migrants into unseaworthy boats.' The commander of the Italian fleet said Europe has 'a duty' to save lives. Vice Admiral Filippo Foffi said: 'We have the duty in these cases when we are at sea, to intervene to save human life. 'If we are not at sea then we can't see what happens, we can close our eyes, turn off the lights. 'There's no need to ""turn back"" the boats because they will die.' Labour leader Ed Miliband slammed the Government's decision to stop saving migrants fleeing Africa on boats . The decision was attacked by Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday, who accused David Cameron of showing a lack of 'basic humanity' during Prime Minister's Questions. Mr Miliband said: ‘On immigration his government combines callousness with incompetence. They don’t show basic humanity and say rescuing drowning people is a pull factor for immigration. ‘But they are so incompetent they can’t deliver their basic promises. Why doesn’t he just admit it, on immigration, he has failed?’ The Prime Minister rejected the criticism and accused Labour of leaving 'the biggest mess this country has ever seen' when it came to immigration. Ministers came under fire in the House of Commons today after confirming the decision that Britain will not provide help to immigrants who get into trouble in the Mediterranean. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said Britain was ready to give further help to EU border management agency Frontex's new Operation Triton in the Mediterranean, which will replace the Italian Mare Nostrum search and rescue mission. A picture from the Italian Navy Press in February shows a boat with African migrants on board spotted by the Navy at sea near Lampedusa, Italy . But responding to the latest news of up to 20 deaths, shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper told MailOnline: ‘The Immigration Minister has today confirmed the awful lack of humanity behind the Government's call to end search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. ‘Ministers claim that stopping the rescue operations will somehow deter people from travelling. ‘But as we have seen today how many more people do they think will die trying before that happens? 'Letting some people drown in order to deter others from trying is inhumane and fails to understand the many reasons why people are prepared to take the risk of getting into these ricketty, overcrowded boats in the first place. ‘The idea that trafficking gangs or desperate refugees will be put off by Ministers planned publicity campaign in North Africa and the Middle East is utterly absurd - and a sham to hide the heartlessness of their approach.’","Italian coastguard saved 93 would-be immigrants when their boat capsized .

"A woman who torched her council home just a fortnight after moving in because she 'didn't like her new neighbours' - comparing her new estate to TV show Shameless - has been jailed. Wenman has more than 80 previous convictions, most of them for dishonesty . Leesa Wenman moved into her new home in Harlow, Essex, at the end of July last year after being rehoused by Harlow District Council – but in under a fortnight was having rows with neighbours. Chelmsford Crown Court heard how the 32-year-old was arrested soon after her flat burst into flames on August 6 - just a fortnight after she moved in. The court heard how neighbours called 999 when they spotted plumes of smoke coming out of Wenman's flat window and that it took firemen 30 minutes to douse the flames, which caused £20,000-worth of damage. Neighbours believed that Wenham, a mother-of-one, was still in the flat and broke down the door to rescue her. But she had climbed out of the window after starting two fires in her bedroom and gone to stay with a friend in Stile Croft a mile away - but was arrested soon afterwards. Carolyn Gardiner, prosecuting, told the court that Wenman was 'not happy' with her new home and said she had argued with neighbours just before the blaze started. She told the court: 'Neighbours smelled smoke, it smelled like plastic was burning. They realised Wenman's flat was on fire. 'This defendant had motive – she had fallen out with her neighbours.' Neighbour Kerry Roche told the court that Wenman had told her she hated living in the new house 'within a week' of moving in, saying she told her she 'did not get on with the neighbours'. Another neighbour said Wenman had told her it was 'like living in the Shameless estate but worse'. The jury heard how two fires were started in the bedroom, with investigators finding burn marks on the floorboards and skirting board. The jury heard how two fires were started in the bedroom, with investigators finding burn marks on the floorboards and skirting board . Chelmsford Crown Court was told Wenman has more than 80 previous convictions, most of them for dishonesty but 19 for failing to obey court orders and she was jailed for 30 months. Neighbours, speaking last week after Wenman was jailed on September 25, said Wenman had said the estate was 'disgusting' and compared it to the fictional Chatsworth council estate in the TV show Shameless. One, who asked not to be named, said Wenman had told her she 'hated the place' within a week of moving in. She said: 'Leesa said the estate was disgusting and said it was like the estate on Shameless. 'She was not happy about being moved here at all and made it very clear she wanted to get out.' Wenman would have been sentenced to seven years in jail but for her diagnosis of Huntington's Disease in 2009. Both her father and her older sister have the condition and are now in care homes. Clare Dowse, defending Wenman, said: 'The diagnosis is a devastating one and particularly for a young woman because, as is well known, it is a disease which is progressive and eventually fatal. 'She must now face the fact that the disease is not going to go away and there's no cure for it so she has to await the same fate as her sister.' Miss Dowse added: 'The defendant's concern is that while she serves any sentence her physical condition may deteriorate to the extent she will not recognise her daughter, who is 10 soon, or interact with her when she is released.' She said that Wenman had been in foster care from her early teenage years and at the age of 13 she started drinking and taking drugs, stealing to feed both those habits. Judge Anthony Goldstaub said that he was reducing her prison term due to her illness.","Leesa Wenman moved into new home in Harlow, Essex at end of July 2013 .

"Fernando Torres is aiming high as he looks to rebuild his reputation as a world class striker at AC Milan after securing a two-year loan deal from Chelsea. Torres appears on the front page of Italy's La Gazzetta dello Sport saying he wants his work in the No 9 shirt at Milan to rank alongside some of the club's legends. 'My shirt to rank alongside [Marco] van Basten, [George] Weah and [Filippo] Inzaghi,' the headline reads. The Spaniard appears alongside fellow striker Stephan El Shaarawy who, much like Torres, is determined to show his worth at the club after a lean 2013-14 campaign. 'It wasn't Balotelli's fault I lost my form,' the Italy international said of the now Liverpool striker who was ahead of him in the pecking order before his departure. High hopes: Fernando Torres and Stephan El Shaarawy have points to prove at AC Milan . Another Spanish forward, Alvaro Morata, is making vows to his new club after joining Juventus from Real Madrid in a £15.8million deal. 'I'm ready and I won't disappoint, this is a personal battle,' he said in Corriere dello Sport. Also the paper says Antonio Conte is likely to favour youth in his first match in charge of Italy with El Shaarawy and Simone Zaza set to feature against Holland and Torres says he'll be 'reborn' at Milan. Despite Roma looking a better prospect than last season Juve are favourites to defend the Scudetto, says Tuttosport. 'Roma have improved strongly, but the non-sale of [Arturo] Vidal and [Paul] Pogba can make the difference.' Ready: Alvaro Morata says he won't disappoint at Juventus, the club Tuttosport expects to win the Scudetto . Spain's sports media are of course reporting the latest blow to Carlo Ancelotti who while keeping Sami Khedira on his books in the transfer window has lost the midfielder for a number of weeks - Marca says six while AS says he could be out for eight weeks. In AS, Sergio Ramos has shown Real Madrid team-mates 'who is boss' with the leadership figure telling star Cristiano Ronaldo that 'we must obey the laws of Madrid' after the striker's recent comments about his side's transfer activity.

"Devoted sisters Florence Davies and Glenys Thomas have been inseparable for more than 100 years - and are the oldest identical twins in the world. The great-great-grandmothers have a family photo album bursting with memories from the 103 years they have shared together. The pair were born in 1912 - the same year the Titanic sunk and national insurance tax was introduced. And the centenary sisters have lived through two world wars, the civil rights movement and huge advances in technology and transport. Scroll down for video . Florence Davies and Glenys Thomas are the world's oldest identical twins after celebrating their 103rd birthday together. They were born on the 22nd November 1911 and grew up in Abertridwr in the South Wales Valleys . But in their lifetime they have never left the small mining village of Abertridwr, Caerphilly. Their family now believe they are the oldest identical twins in the world - and credit their great age to a 'nice, quiet life'. Glenys's daughter Gwenda Stacey, 65, said: 'They have lived a simple life. Neither Mam or Aunty Flo can drive. They never went abroad. But they were always happiest together.' Born in a time when community came first , Gwenda recalls her mother telling stories about the 'good old days.' She said: 'My grandfather was a miner and very good with his hands. He made toys for the girls and their mother made their clothes. The whole family's social life was centered around their church and their community. You had to stay local in those days because it was so hard to get around. Florence, right, and Glenys, pictured aged seven in 1918, were born in 1912 - the same year the Titanic sunk and national insurance tax was introduced . The pair, pictured here age 68 at Christmas, have five children, 12 grandchildren and 19 great grandchildren . The great-great-grandmothers have a family photo album bursting with memories from the 103 years they have shared together, including this one at their 70th birthday . 'My mam remembers the first bus coming to Abertridwr and what an occasion it was. Now people are less content with their lot. Everyone wants to move so fast. Their life wasn't like that.' As young women, the twins both went into service - cleaning the homes of well off people. Gwenda said: 'They weren't allowed to go dancing or courting as teenagers. They led respectful and God-fearing lives - their parents were very religious.' In 1932, Glenys was the first to leave home when she married a miner, William Scrivens, who died aged 67. They adopted Gwenda a few years later when it became apparent they couldn't conceive a child. Glenys later became a grandmother to three, a great grandmother to nine and she has one great-great-grandson. She also remarried in 1972, aged 60. Florence remained in the family home for two more years until she met the man she would marry, John Davies, who died aged 48. Glenys, left, and Florence, pictured in 1932 age 21, both went to service - cleaning the homes of well off people. They weren't allowed to go dancing or courting as teenagers. They led respectful and God fearing lives - their parents were very religious . Their father, John, was a miner and very good with his hands and their mother, Margaret, made their clothes. The whole family's social life was centered around their church and their community . In 1932, Glenys was the first to leave home when she married a miner, William Scrivens, who died aged 67. Pictured: Glenys and William on their wedding day age 20 in 1931 . Florence went on to have three children, nine grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren. She never remarried. Retired printer's assistant Gwenda said: 'The twins missed each other terribly when they moved out of the family home. They had shared a room until my mam left to get married. Then Aunty Flo followed suit and bought a house next door to her sister. 'For all their independent years they lived side by side - raising families together, shopping, socialising and cooking together too.' Now the elderly sisters have moved into a care home as their mental health has deteriorated with age. Gwenda expalined: 'Mam and Flo were always so active and independent. Right up until their 90s they would hop on the bus to go shopping together. They loved to look good and often bought the same outfits. Florence, age 25 with baby Yorwerth, went on to have three children, nine grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren . Suffering from dementia, the twins, seen here aged 7 in 1918, are now looked after in the Abermill Care Home, just a five minute drive from Gwenda's home in Abertridwr . 'When both of them were widowed they really took care of each other. Like all sisters they fell out but they never stopped us kids from seeing each other. 'We were always in and out of both houses. We were one big happy family.' Suffering from dementia, the twins are now looked after in the Abermill Care Home, just a five minute drive from Gwenda's home in Abertridwr. She said: 'They have adjoining rooms so they see each other whenever they like. Aunty Flo does get a bit fed up with mam's singing though. Her dementia sends her back to her childhood and she's forever singing Calon Lan - a welsh song she'd have learnt at school. 'They are physically very well - no ailments as such. But it is their mind that's going. It can be like they are far away and mostly they don't remember the family. Yet they still ask for each other. Their connection is lasting and truly life long.'","Florence Davies and Glenys Thomas have been inseparable for 103 years .

"They say every picture tells a story. A newly-unearthed photograph showing Mitt Romney demonstrating in favour of the Vietnam War draft might leave the presidential candidate feeling somewhat embarrassed. The veteran Republican, then 19, can be seen picketing an anti-war sit-in at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, in 1966. Mr Romney will no doubt be proud of his younger self taking what was at the time a very unpopular stance. However, he might grimace at his clean-cut appearance and preppy wardrobe. Taking a stand: A young Mitt Romney holds up a placard at a pro-draft demonstration at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, in May 1966 . Fortunate son: Mr Romney's status as a 'Mormon missionary' meant he was exempt from the Vietnam War draft . Taken at the height of the swinging . Sixties, Mr Romney holds a sign declaring 'Speak Out, Don't Sit In' as, . alongside like-minded individuals, he proclaims his support for Lyndon . Johnson's ever-expanding draft. But, in a marked contrast to the relaxed  dress sense associated with that decade's youth movement, he is wearing smart white slacks, a white buttoned-up shirt and a dark blazer. A newspaper clipping headlined . 'Governor's son pickets the pickets' states: 'Mitt Romney, son of . Michigan Gov. George Romney, was one of the pickets who supported the . Stanford University administration in opposition to sit-in . demonstrators.' The photograph was taken on May 20, . 1966, shortly after a group of students had taken over the office of Stanford . University President Wallace Sterling. They were protesting at the introduction of a test designed to help the authorities decide who was eligible for the draft. Mr Romney was one of approximately 150 conservative students who counter-picketed the sit-in. Carey Coulter was one of the demonstrators alongside Mr Romney that day. He told BuzzFeed.com: 'We were there to get an education and . these people holding the administration hostage was antithetical to . that. 'Mitt walked up to me and said that he had . some experience with the press, and that he would handle the press for . me if I wanted him to. I said fine, because I was . busy running the demonstration. 'I don't recall ever seeing him again.' The press experience to which Mr Romney referred no doubt came from witnessing how his father, George, dealt with the media. George Romney headed American Motors . before becoming Michigan governor in 1963, a position he held for six . years before being appointed Secretary of Housing and Urban Development . by Richard Nixon. Handling the press: A newspaper cutting records the moment the future presidential candidate made his mark . Ironically, he later had a change of heart and turned against the Vietnam War. His pro-war son, meanwhile, never . served in south-east Asia because his status as a Mormon missionary exempted him from the draft. The GOP hopeful spent just one year at Stanford before heading to France for 30 months of missionary work. He had already met his future wife Ann in 1965 when he . was 18 and she was 15. The couple married in 1969 and have five sons and 16 grandchildren. Mr Romney went on to earn millions as a business consultant and venture capitalist. After co-founding private equity firm . Bain Capital in the late 1970s, he helped launch the Staples office . supply chain, as well as buy Domino's Pizza. His public career began in 1999, when . he was recruited to take over the 2002 Winter Olympics after scandal . and financial deficits threatened the Salt Lake City games. In 2003, he took over as governor of . Massachusetts after a campaign in which he cast himself as a moderate on . abortion, gay rights and stem cell research. He had sounded many of the . same themes during an unsuccessful 1994 U.S. Senate race against . Democrat Edward M Kennedy. He chose not to seek a second term and instead turned his sights to the White House. Americans United for Change, a liberal group, last month used this 1980s photograph of Mitt Romney (centre) and his Bain Capital colleagues to compare him to Wall Street movie villain Gordon Gekko . Like father, like son: George Romney (left), then Secretary for Housing and Urban Development, signs an agreement with British Secretary of State Peter Walker in 1971 . He lost the 2008 GOP nomination to John McCain and has been plotting his latest presidential nomination ever since. But a record of changing positions on . social issues including abortion and gay rights has left many . conservatives questioning his sincerity. Mr Romney oversaw a health care law . enacted in Massachusetts that is similar to Barack Obama's national . health overhaul, which conservatives despise. He has also struggled to allay some sceptics of his Mormon faith. His extreme wealth - the . Romneys are believed to be worth between $190million . and $264million - allowed him to invest more than $40million of his own money in the 2008 race. Campaign trail: Mr Romney thanks Senator John McCain at an event in Charleston, South Carolina, yesterday . Winning streak? The former Massachusetts governor emerged the victor in the Iowa caucuses on Wednesday after hours of being deadlocked with former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum . It recently emerged that Mr Romney has plans to quadruple the size of his $12 million California home. The . 64-year-old filed an application in San Diego, California, to bulldoze his . 3,009-square-foot oceanfront mansion in La Jolla and replace it with an . 11,062-square-foot property. A campaign official said that the GOP . hopeful was planning . the expansion as the home he bought three years ago 'is inadequate for . their needs'. The . Romneys' official primary residence is a town house outside Boston. They also own a $10million vacation home on the shore of Lake . Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. The couple sold the 6,400-square-foot . home in Belmont, Massachusetts, where they raised their children, in . 2009 for $3.5million. In addition, their 9,500-square-foot ski lodge in Deer Valley, Utah, fetched $5.25million last year.","Teenage Romney takes unpopular stance in favour of south-east Asian war .

"Smoking and drinking are two vices that tend to go hand in hand. Not surprisingly, when the cost of one of those taboos goes up, people tend to engage in both of them less. According to a study published on Wednesday in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, raising the tax on cigarettes lowers both smoking and drinking habits--except for wine. The study concludes that wine drinkers tend have a healthier lifestyle than those who drink beer and spirits because wine drinkers don't smoke as much. Co-morbid habits: Those who tend to smoke tend to drink both beers and spirits and when the tax on smoking increases, both smoking and drinking decreases . Prices and consumption: The higher the price of cigarettes the less likely people are to smoke and drink alcohols like hard liquor and beer . 'The results made sense to us because prior research shows that wine drinkers are less likely to smoke,' said Melissa Krauss, a data analyst at the Washington University School of Medicine and one of the authors of the study. NPR reports that Krauss and other researchers analyzed data from the U.S. between 1980 and 2009 and measured how much alcohol was consumed per state, per person, and then measured each state's cost of a pack of cigarettes in addition to their smoke-free air policies in public places. In 1980 the median cost of a cigarette was just $1.76 per pack. In 2009 the median price of a cigarette went up to $5.68. Also through the years, the adoption of smoke free policies increased as alcohol consumption dropped. NPR reports that states that had the highest tax increase per pack of cigarettes also had the largest drop in people drinking beers and spirits. States with high cigarette taxes showed a 26 per cent drop in drinking. States with low cigarette price increases only showed a 5 per cent drop. The researchers of the study suggested that a 20 per cent increase in cigarette price would cause a 2 per cent reduction per capita in drinking. 'We already know that strengthening tobacco policies has great benefit in reducing smoking prevalence,' says Krauss. 'This shows that there are unintended consequences that are having good public health benefits as well.' Healthier: The price of cigarettes didn't alter the amount that wine drinkers drink wine because wine drinkers generally have healthier lifestyles and are less likely to be smokers, says the study .","According to a study published  in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, raising the tax on cigarettes lowers smoking and drinking .

"Defeat: Arthur Scargill lost his High Court battle to have the miner's union pay for the rent on his London flat for the rest of his life today . The former miners’ leader Arthur Scargill has lost his fight to have the National Union of Mineworkers pay the rent on his London flat for the rest of his life. Mr Scargill, 74, had argued that he signed a contract which entitled him to a property throughout his retirement. But the union disputed the claim and took the decision all the way to the High Court. And today Mr Justice Underhill ruled in the National Union of Mineworkers' (NUM) favour stating that no such agreement had been made. After the ruling, NUM general secretary Chris Kitchen said that it was 'regrettable' that it had to bring the case against the 74-year-old who was president for 20 years until July 2002. Mr Scargill said that the judgment was 'perverse' and flew in the face of all the evidence. He . said: 'There can be no doubt that 30 years ago I was given an . entitlement to a property by the union and that entitlement continued . during my retirement, as it had done for all my predecessors including . Lord Gormley and, after he died, his widow Lady Gormley.' Asked if he will launch an appeal, he said: 'I shall talk to my lawyers about . what the best course of action will be, but I think any independent . observer will regard this as yet another judgment with the anti-Scargill . feeling about it.' Mr . Scargill has occupied the Barbican apartment, rented from the . Corporation of London, since June 1982 - and the rent and associated . expenses were paid by the union until 2011, except for a period between . 1985 and 1991 when he met them. The . case was based on documents dating back 30 years and the identification . of what terms were agreed between himself and duly authorised . representatives of the NUM. 'Regrettable': General Secretary of the miners' union Chris Kitchen indicated they had not wanted to bring the matter to court . The judge rejected Mr Scargill’s . argument that having the union pay the rent on the flat was a . replacement for the benefit given to his predecessors - who all had . houses bought for them in or near London which they were entitled to . occupy before and after retirement at a very low rent or very reduced . purchased price - and therefore was also a lifetime benefit. He . said the original minutes of the National Executive Committee (NEC) from 1982 did not say that and it was not in the original contract which . Mr Scargill signed. When, . in 1991, Mr Scargill decided he did not want to take up the benefit of . having a house bought for him but instead wanted the union to resume . paying the flat rental, he should have gone back to the NEC and sought . its authority, he added. Instead, . said the judge, Mr Scargill obtained on his own initiative, and without . involving the NEC, legal advice which supported his right to have the . union pay for the Barbican flat and told the finance department to . resume payments. Battle: Mr Scargill said he will talk to his lawyers before deciding whether to appeal the decision by Mr Justice Underhill . 'Although . Mr Scargill claims otherwise, the process of drafting the contracts and . obtaining the legal advice, which should have been on an arm’s-length . basis, was done entirely on his initiative and under his control. None . of this was disclosed to the NEC.' 'The legal advice was based on information provided by him which did not give the full picture; and anyway it could not make up for the absence of NEC authorisation. 'Therefore, when Mr Scargill retired in 2002, the contract which appeared to give him the right to have the union continue to pay the rent on the Barbican flat was not effective because the NEC had never approved his having any such right.' The union also successfully disputed . Mr Scargill’s fuel allowance at his Barnsley home and payment for the . preparation of his annual tax return - but not the cost of his security . system in Yorkshire.","Claimed it was agreed with National Union of Mineworkers 30 years ago .

"RUDE, vulgar, gross and hilarious...it’s no surprise South Park has legions of fans. But even the cartoon's most devoted followers would run for the hills at the thought of a video game based on the 2D series. Thankfully, though, all fears are allayed when you see South Park: The Stick Of Truth in action. Just like the cartoon: It looks so good, you'll often forget you're playing a game . You begin as the new kid in town facing a harrowing challenge: making friends. As you start your quest, the children of South Park are embroiled in a city-wide, live-action-role-playing game, casting imaginary spells and swinging fake swords. Over time, the simple children’s game escalates into a battle of good and evil that threatens to consume the world. And from the perilous battlefields of the fourth-grade playground, a young hero will rise, destined to be South Park’s saviour. Developers Obsidian Entertainment, best known for their work on Knights Of The Old Republic: The Sith Lords, have gone to town in making this as authentic a South Park experience as possible. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have penned the story and there’s a real intent to break the poor cartoon-to-game curse. You’ll be able to customise your character with an arsenal of magical weapons and armour. Take that, sucker: You'll have to use spells and weapons to battle some vampires . Plus, with nearly a billion character and clothing combinations, you’ll actually be able to insert yourself into the cartoon. Graphics are brilliant. Everything from the little 'bobs' the characters do when they move to their quirky facial expressions has been captured. Indeed, it almost looks like you’re watching an episode. In a nod to Skyrim and Fallout, The Stick of Truth is an open-world game. Characters can level up certain skills, such as magic or weapons, and can choose different classes (Mage, Cleric, Fighter and Thief) in their quest to become...cool. Each time you level up, you’re treated to Cartman dishing out your (often rude) new title. Combat is turn-based, which will appeal to hardcore RPG fans fed of clunky real-time combat often associated with modern games in the genre. It’s refreshing to see a cartoon-to-video-game offering be on course to do a series justice – something movie-game tie-ins just can’t seem to do these days. You shall not pass! Cartman stands firm as archers charge towards him . All apart from the recent Battleship, that is, which sunk in both cinemas and on consoles - the game, in particular, being one of the worst I’ve played in years. Can South Park do the near impossible and pave the way for quality cartoon and movie video game transitions? We'll have to wait until March next year to find out.

"Wildlife researches have charted a grizzly bear's astonishing three-year, 2,800-mile trek through backyards, down main streets and up mountains - in what they have deemed a 'bizarre' journey. Ethyl the grizzly bear was captured raiding an apple orchard in Lake Blaine, Montana in 2012 and was fitted with a radio collar that sent GPS data to a satellite once a week. After she got her new collar, she was relocated 50 miles away to Middle Fork of the Flathead River because her previous home was not deemed safe, researchers told Fox News. What they gathered from the GPS data over the next three years astonished them. Scroll down for video . Trek: A map shows a grizzly bear's incredible 2,800 journey from the mountains of Montana and into Idaho after she was captured in 2012 and fitted with a radio collar that sent GPS data to researchers . Route: She trekked around Montana before going into Idaho and then heading west before back to Montana . 'The one thing we can say is this was not representative of normal bear movement, and certainly not female grizzly bear movement,' Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery program coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told The Missoulian. 'She had some really bizarre travels.' Fox reported that these 'bizarre' movements were prompted by her move to an unknown place. But if she indeed was trying to get back home, she took the scenic route. The incredible data shows that she headed south to the Mission Mountains Wilderness and Jocko Lakes - which is about 120 miles from her starting point - before heading another 120 miles south to the Bitterroot Mountains and eventually into Idaho. She then headed 200 miles north to pass the towns of Wallace and Kellogg, where she hibernated - but not before the Kellogg newspaper reported a sighting of her near the town's high school. Spotted: The daring bear walked through backyards, around downtown areas and across highways . Journey: Her journey - which has left researchers baffled - is extremely unusual for a female grizzly bear . After waking up again, she headed to Missoula, Montana and towards the small town of Lolo. When she arrived, she wandered downtown - right through the streets and backyards - into landfills and across I-90 but astonishingly there were no reported sightings of her, Fox News reported. 'She was minding her own business, walking around trying to figure out where she is,' Servheen said. On one occasion, she nearly made it back home but instead missed it and headed to Glacier National Park and then headed west again. She eventually lost her collar on October 17. 'The area and terrain she covered was pretty significant,' Lori Roberts, a researcher with the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, told Fox. 'She just wasn't travelling on flat ground. She made huge crossings across mountains, rivers, and even towns.' Ethyl (like the grizzly bear pictured) eventually lost her collar in October but officials hope to find her again . She added that researchers hope to find Ethyl - who was named after the owner of the apple orchard where she was first found in 2006 and then 2012 - and check in on her. Speaking to the Missoulian, conversationalists said that while they cannot be 100 per cent sure  why Ethyl went on her ramble, the tracking has taught them that the beasts can co-exist with people. Officials believe Ethyl, who was found with a two-year-old cub when she was captured and tagged in 2012, is in her 20s. Grizzly bears live until up to about 30 years.","Ethyl was fitted with a radio collar after she was found raiding an apple orchard in 2012 and the trek she took afterwards stunned researchers .

"Teaching assistant Helen Louis Turnbull pictured today arriving at Teesside Crown Court on the second day of her trial . A married teaching assistant threatened to have her schoolboy lover murdered by gipsies if he tried to leave her, a court heard yesterday. Helen Turnbull, now 35, allegedly told the 16-year-old she would hire a notorious family of travellers to shoot him. The schoolboy said he was left in a state of constant worry, believing that Turnbull, a mother of two, had accessed confidential school records to find out his home address in order to have him killed. The victim was allegedly groomed with sweets and cuddles from the age of 12 at his Roman Catholic secondary school in Durham. When he turned 16 he began to meet Turnbull for liaisons in her Mini after she sent him provocative pictures of herself in her underwear, and messages asking for ‘power sex’. Turnbull split from her husband during the brief affair, and even changed her Facebook profile picture from one featuring her three-year-old daughter to a photograph of her and the schoolboy. On only their second meeting outside the classroom the pair are said to have kissed before having sex in Turnbull’s car. The boy said the teaching assistant gave him a packet of 10 cigarettes afterwards. They met twice more during the summer holiday, allegedly having sex both times. Giving evidence on a police video played to court yesterday, Turnbull’s victim, now 18, told how the affair took a sinister turn when it became ‘too much’ for him to deal with. He told officers he had been left ‘really worried and anxious’ after Turnbull threatened to contact a family of gipsies. ‘She said: “You deserve shooting, I am going to get a contract out”,’ he added. ‘We argued over stupid stuff and I was making excuses when she wanted to see me. It got too much, it is stupid the way it happened and what happened.’ The schoolboy said that even as he was ending their affair, Turnbull continued to send him messages and even used a teenage girl as a go-between in a bid to win him back. He added: ‘She came by my house but I never told her my address. I don’t know how she found out where I live, that is what worried me the most... she had made threats that she is going to get people to come and see me, and she has found out where I live.’ The pupil said he assumed she had accessed his personal details on the school database. Teesside Crown Court had earlier heard how Turnbull confronted the child’s father at the family home. He accused the teaching assistant of being a paedophile. Turnbull denies three charges of sexual activity with a child while holding a position of trust, but has admitted a fourth, relating to kissing. The case continues. Helen Turnbull, pictured right at an earlier court appearance, allegedly became 'obsessive' about the  relationship with the boy.

"Controversial: Sally Mason has apologized for making a comment that implied that she felt sexual assaults were inevitable because of 'human nature' The University of Iowa president has been forced to apologize after saying that sexual assaults were a result of 'human nature'. Sally Mason made the controversial remark as part of a monthly interview with the campus newspaper and has faced an immediate backlash from student protestors who took her comments to mean that she thinks rape is inevitable. 'The goal would be to end that, to never have another sexual assault. That’s probably not a realistic goal just given human nature, and that’s unfortunate, but the more we understand about it, the better we are at trying to handle it and help people get through these difficult situations,' she said in the interview with The Daily Iowan.

"Voters believe Ed Miliband’s Labour party is ‘nice but dim’ and not capable of taking the tough decisions needed as Prime Minister, damning new polling reveals. The Labour leader is seen weaker, less charismatic and worse in a crisis than David Cameron, as pollsters warn he will have to ‘defy history’ to take power after just one term in opposition. But the most damaging revelation is that voters see Mr Miliband as more like Harry Enfield’s character Tim Nice But Dim than a future Prime Minister. Nice but dim: Harry Enfield's character Tim Nice But Dim (left) was hugely popular in the 1990s, but now voters associate the phrase with Labour under Ed Miliband (right) In a withering assessment of the main opposition, voters were asked if Labour's 'heart is in the right place and it does NOT have what it takes  to get what it wants done in government'. Almost a third (31 per cent) of people agreed Labour under Mr Miliband is 'nice but dim', compared to only 14 per cent of Mr Cameron's Tories. The proportion of people who voted Labour in 2010 who now think the party is nice but dim was even higher, at 33 per cent. Another 10 per cent of Labour voters think the party is 'mean'. A small majority of people think Labour will 'be on the side of people like you' and will ensure public services provide good value for money. But on 10 other measures polled, more people think a Labour government would fail rather than succeed, including having the courage to take tough decisions, defending British interests on Europe and immigration and learning from the mistakes of the past. Voters are most likely to think Labour is 'nice but dim' while the the Tories are viewed as 'mean and dim' Mean machine: Voters are more likely to say David Cameron's Tories are 'mean' but also think he is more decisive and better in a crisis than Mr Miliband . Just 21 per cent thought a Labour majority government would 'keep their promises' against 47 per cent who think they would not. While the Tories also scroe badly on governing in the interests of the whole of Britain, not just their friends, and learning from the mistakes of the past, they are well ahead on the economy. More than half of people (54 per cent) think a Conservative majority government will 'take the right decisions to help Britain's economy recove, while just 28 per cent thought they would not. For Labour, less than a third (32 per cent) thought Mr Miliband would make the right call on the economy. With less than two years to go until the general election, voters are evenly split on which main party leader they would like to see in Number 10 after polling day. According to the YouGov survey, when forced to choose 40 per cent opted for Mr Cameron and 41 per cent said Mr Miliband. Two years before the 2010 election, Mr Cameron had a 12-point lead over Gordon Brown. Six months before the 1997 Labour landslide, Tony Blair had a 35-point lead over John Major. When forced to choose, only 83 per cent of people who voted Labour in the 2010 election would prefer Mr Miliband to be Prime Minister over Mr Cameron. Crucially, less than half of Lib Dem voters would want to see Mr Miliband in Number 10, in a blow to his hopes of wooing supporters disaffected by Nick Clegg’s decision to go into government with the Tories. While Mr Cameron's personal ratings have fallen in the last two years, he is still seen as being more decisive, stronger and good in a crisis than Mr Miliband . Analysis of the way voters view the two main parties reveals Labour’s small lead is more a result of Tory unpopularity than any enthusiasm for Mr Miliband. Despite the economy flat-lining under the coalition, just one in three voters think Labour would take the right decisions to secure greater prosperity. YouGov’s Peter Kellner said: ‘There is not a single time in more than eighty years when an opposition party has returned to power at the first attempt with an overall majority. ‘If Ed Miliband does head a majority government after 2015, Labour’s victory will be the first of its kind in modern times,’ he wrote in an article for Progress. ‘In as far as Labour’s figures look good, this is because so many people think badly of the Tories, rather than because of wide public enthusiasm for Labour.’ Labour is seen as more likely to keep its promises than the Tories, but much less likely to take tough and unpopular decisions . Labour scores better on being on the side of voters and getting value for money from public services . The trials and tribulations of being in power have taken their toll on Mr Cameron’;s personal ratings, and he is now seen as less decisive, strong and honest than two years ago. But the Prime Minister’s decline has not been matched by any improvement in the Miliband ‘brand’, Mr Kellner noted. Two years ago only 36 per cent of voters credited the Labour leader with any positive attribute. Today the figures stands at just 41 per cent. Mr Kellner concludes: ‘Overall, the fact that Miliband has closed the gap with Cameron has everything to do with the Prime Minister’s mounting unpopularity and nothing with Miliband’s own appeal.’ So far he has failed to convince the public that he would be a competent Prime Minister who is able to take tough decisions or assure voters that Labour has learned from the mistakes it made last time. Mr Miliband is warned that he will struggle to win seats from both the Lib Dems and Tories at the next election. Predictions that the party will take 14 seats from the Lib Dems 'look like a stretch', Mr Kellner said.","One in three people think Labour under Miliband is 'nice but dim'
Miliband is more 'honest' and 'in touch with ordinary people' than Cameron .
But the PM is seen as stronger, more decisive and 'good in a crisis'"
"Cowboy surgery: Louise Siu's simple procedure went horribly wrong . Louise Siu has made her career as an actuary – a discipline that assesses financial risk. So when the 47-year-old decided to have cosmetic laser treatment in 2007, she made sure she did some careful research. And it confirmed that the procedure – to get rid of thread veins around her nose – should be simple and safe. She chose a London clinic that appeared to be reputable and her first treatment with the Yag laser was uneventful, leaving Louise pleased with the results. But her next appointment in January 2008 was not so straightforward. A different nurse arrived to carry out the treatment and Louise noticed there were a far greater number of laser ‘shots’ to her nose. ‘It felt like upwards of three times more than I’d had during the previous appointment,’ she says. ‘I think back to it now and I wonder why I didn’t tell her to stop. But it all happened very quickly and I trusted the clinic. ‘When I got home that evening, it felt as if my face was on fire. I slept really badly that night and I had this hot, burning sensation around my nose.’ Louise realised that something was terribly wrong. She went to work next day, but by lunchtime large blisters had begun to appear and she quickly returned to the clinic. She was told the injuries were superficial. But over the following weeks, the blisters turned into unsightly scabs and she had to take time off work. When the scabs came off, there were deep scars all around her nostrils. ‘I remember looking in the mirror and realising I had been scarred,’ she says. ‘I just started crying. ‘I cried for days – I just couldn’t believe this had happened to me.’ The clinic agreed to send her to a dermatologist, who confirmed she had suffered burns that had left her with ‘quite severe scarring’. More pain was to come when the High Street clinic denied responsibility, saying that it was an unfortunate skin reaction. In June 2009, Louise finally got lawyers involved. The clinic admitted negligence and she received £15,000 compensation. She has had treatment to repair the scars but her emotional recovery may take far longer. ‘It’s hard to get back on track. It all . brought me so low, especially the way the clinic behaved. I absolutely . regret having it done.’ Burned: The damage on Louise's nose from the . The Mail on Sunday is calling for anyone who carries out laser treatment to have a minimum level of training and to be registered with an independent regulator. This would ensure that all staff know which setting the laser should be on and also how much the laser should be used in each session. This type of training and certification would reduce the risk of burns, such as those experienced by Louise. The Government shocked medics in 2010 by deregulating certain types of medical lasers that are strong enough to cause serious harm if not used properly. Today, anyone can carry out a laser treatment – they no longer have to be a healthcare professional – and their premises are no longer inspected. According to Government estimates, the NHS spends £2 million a year fixing botched laser operations. But the problem is set to get worse as more patients opt to have the quick-fix beauty treatment. A survey in 2008 estimated that six million women were considering laser therapy and 700,000 had already had it. But the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons says there are at least 4,000 reports of adverse events following laser treatments every year.",Louise Siu's cosmetic laser treatment in 2007 left her with horrible scars .
"The crisis at beleaguered Championship side Blackpool has intensified with fresh accusations being made in the civil war between the club's chairman and president. Blackpool's chairman Karl Oyston has released an open letter hitting back at club president Valeri Belokon, a Latvian businessman who has a 20 per cent stake in the side. It comes with fans fearful of the future with only 11 registered players - but no goalkeeper - ahead of their first league match of the season at Nottingham Forest on August 9. Belokon last week accused the Oyston family of putting financial gain ahead of the club and of having 'channeled away more than £24 million'. Chairman: Karl Oyston refuted claims that he had contributed to Blackpool's demise this summer . Now Oyston has hit back, saying in a letter published on the club website that it is the Latvian who is demanding £24million from the club and defending his family's running of Blackpool. Oyston's letter says Belokon asked for £24million to buy out his 20 per cent shareholding a year ago and asked for that again last week. The letter states: 'This, Valeri, if had we agreed to pay £24million, would have given you a massive profit of virtually three times the original combined cost of your shares, which cost you £1.8million, with a further £6.6 million loan from you to contribute towards the construction and fit-out of the South and South West stands. 'You have already taken £1.86million from the football club.' Threat: Manager Jose Riga has threatened to quit Blackpool in protest of player sales . Belokon accused the Oystons of moving more than £24million to other family companies in the form of interest-free loans without his approval, and of taking more than £11.5million out of the club in salaries. Oyston says his father Owen Oyston and the family 'have funded the club since the day he got involved 27 years ago' and that his father 'has never taken a penny in dividends or any salary or any consultancy fees'. Oyston said the £24million 'was in part used to pay off loans to Protoplan Ltd, Zabaxe Ltd, which was a considerable benefit to Blackpool Football Club because they were loans that had been used to build and modernise the BFC stadium and to provide BFC with income streams. Please note that Protoplan and Zabaxe, both Oyston group companies, did not take profit or interest on those loans. Protest: Blackpool fans express their anger at Karl Oyston's running of the Championship side . 'You say that my father and I took £11.5million in salaries. The board approved the payment of £11million to Zabaxe Ltd, a company owned by my father. 'The money did not go to him personally and it was paid in consideration to Zabaxe for its financial help and the help of other group companies for having supported the football club over a period of 24 years and building much of the stadium you see today. This involved large interest-free loans, without which support BFC would not have survived.' Oyston adds that the family are 'in this for the long termi and expresses surprise that Pelokon has been backed by the Blackpool Supporters' Trust and the Seasiders Independent Supporters' Association.","Blackpool only have 11 registered players and no goalkeeper .

"Robin Williams has left his estate valued at $50 million to his three children - with his wife Susan Schneider cared for under the terms of a  prenup they signed before their 2011 wedding. MailOnline has obtained a copy of the late star's will, which is dated January 31, 2011, and was filed last week at court in Marin County, California, three months after his death. His beloved children, Zachary, 31, Zelda, 25, and Cody, 22, are looked after by the Robin Williams Trust, which is now being run by a trustee. And after two failed marriages which reportedly cost him $30 million, Robin ensured that he and his third wife Susan signed a prenup agreement, which is dated September 28, 2011. Devastated: Robin Williams' widow Susan Schneider (pictured with the star in 2012) prayed over his body before she allowed it to be removed from their home following his death on August 11. She is being cared for financially after the couple signed a pre-nup before their 2011 wedding . Cared for: Robin Williams has left provision for this three children in a trust, according to his newly filed will. The late star is pictured with, from left, son Cody, son Zak, ex-wife Marha Garces, and daughter Zelda in 2005 . The couple wed at the luxurious Meadowood Resort in the Napa Valley town of St. Helena, California, a month later on Oct. 22, 2011. The troubled comic was found hanging from a belt at his home in Marin County, California, on August 11. He was 63. On Friday, authorities formally ruled the star's death as suicide as it was revealed he was struggling with a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease, anxiety, depression and paranoia. At the time of his death, Robin and Susan were sharing a house in Tiburon, CA, which is now valued at more than $7 million. It is not known whether Susan will be able to stay at the house under the terms of the prenup - or whether she will get the proceeds of the property if it is sold as the will states: 'I intend by this will to dispose of all property wherever situated that I am entitled to dispose of by will. 'I direct the Executor of this Will and the Trustee of the Trust...to fulfill my obligations under that certain prenuptial agreement with Susan dated September 28, 2011.' The Mrs Doubtfire star also owned a lavish Napa Valley estate, called Villa of Smiles, which is currently on the market for $29.9 million. Although there is 'significant interest' in the property, according to real estate sources. Robin was married three times, first to Valerie Velardi from 1978-1988, then from Marsha Garces from 1989 to 2010 and finally to Susan. He is believed to have paid his first two wives more than $30 million in combined divorce settlements, telling the Daily Telegraph in November 2011 just months after his third marriage, 'Ah yes, divorce, from the Latin word meaning to rip out a man’s genitals through his wallet.' But he bore no ill will to his former wives, saying: 'I get on fabulously with my exes - now we’re not together any more. And they always appreciated my body hair, which was a plus, obviously.' In the interview, he told how he met Susan in 2007 outside an Apple store, saying: 'We were both looking for weird technology and our eyes met.' Asked about taking a third trip down the aisle, he laughed that given his track record, it was 'a bit like bringing a burn victim to a fireworks display.' Beloved: Robin Williams with his two eldest children, Zachary and Zelda and ex-wife Marsha in 2006 . On the market: Robin Williams' stunning Napa Valley estate, Villa Sorriso - Villa of Smiles - is selling  for $29.9 million . Sprawling: Robin Williams' 20,000-square-foot home boasts five bedrooms, six full and five half bathrooms . Luxury: The Villa of Smiles even has its own private movie theater . Away from it all: The estate is more than 650 acres and has a winery and extensive views of the surrounding Sugarloaf Ridge State Park . According to legal documents filed by Robin, he first established a financial trust on December 26, 1989, after the birth of his son, Zachary 'Zak' Pym Williams, with first wife Valerie Velardi, and just months after the birth of Zelda, born on July 31, 1989, to his second wife, Marsha Garces. It was originally filed as part of his divorce from Valerie and was meant to ensure that she would get alimony and child support in the event of his death. By March 30, 2011, it was updated with a note that Valerie would no longer profit in the event of the star's death, as 'all spousal support obligations' had been satisfied, and that Zak would be the 'sole beneficiary' of that trust. Zak was also 'entitled to distributions of principal in such amounts as the Trustees consider necessary for … support, education, and medical care.' According to documents obtained by Radar, Williams established another trust covering all the children in December 2009, in the midst of his divorce from Marsha. The full extent of that trust’s disbursement was planned to occur in stages: 'When the beneficiary reaches the age of 21 years … [they would receive] one third (1/3) of the principal.' At 25, they would receive 'one half (1/2) of the remaining principal,” and at 30 they would receive 'the remaining trust property … outright.' The trust was not dependent on Robin's death and so far, Zak, who is married to wife Catherine, is the only one of the children to have received all of his money after turning 30. His fortune has been valued at $50 million by Celebrity Net Worth. 'Very difficult and emotional': Robin Williams found filming the scene in World's Greatest Dad hard. He played the father of a son who killed himself accidentally through auto-erotica . Home: Robin Williams was living with his third wife Susan Schneider at this house in Tilburon, CA. It's valued at $7 million and it's not yet known whether it will go on the market . In the months before his death, Robin had put his stunning Napa Valley estate, Villa Sorriso - Villa of Smiles - up for sale. He had tried to sell the home in 2012 for $35 million but did not find any buyers, then in April this year he re-listed the home for the reduced price of $29.9 million. He told Parade Magazine in September 2013: 'The idea of having a steady job is appealing... 'There are bills to pay. My life has downsized, in a good way. I'm selling the ranch up in Napa. I just can't afford it anymore.' On Friday, the Coroner's court revealed that Robin did not have any illegal drugs or alcohol in his system when he committed suicide. The report states the Mrs Doubtfire star - who had battled drink and drugs in the past - had four drugs in his system at the time of his death. Toxicology reports found two anti-depressants and two caffeine compounds and there was no alcohol in his system. When authorities found Robin's body, the reports states they saw a closed bottle of Seroquel, a drug that treats schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and depression. It was prescribed a week before he died. Today, TMZ reported that the actor's suicide could have been triggered by a common but devastating form of dementia that may have disrupted his normal brain function. Court documents obtained by TMZ reveal that Robin was suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies. Sources connected with the troubled comic's family told the site that the degenerative disease was the 'key factor' they believe drove him to take his own life. All smiles: Robin Williams and his only daughter Zelda at the Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards in 2006 . Robin was found dead in a bedroom at his Tiburon home. Most poignantly, the Coroner's report states that his wife Susan wanted to see her husband's body before it was taken away, and that she was joined by Sheriff's deputies as she prayed over him. She was also asked by authorities if her husband was interested in auto-erotica, which she said he was not. But she added that he was left troubled by his work on his 2009 movie, World's Greatest Dad, in which his character's son died after hanging himself for sexual gratification. The legendary comic battled paranoia, according to the report, and the night before he died, he placed several wristwatches in a sock and gave them to someone because he was worried about their safe keeping. When asked about his behavior, Susan said he seemed well and had taken his iPad from their closet which she took to be a good sign because he hadn't watched TV or read anything in about six months. The web browser had several tabs open to websites discussing medications, including Lyrica, an anti-seizure drug, and propranolol, which treats blood pressure and tremors. Tragic: One of the last pictures Robin Williams posted on his Instagram account. Posing with Crystal the monkey, who had co-starred with him in the Night at the Musem films.  Williams posed with his furry friend on his 63rd birthday on July 21, writing, “Happy Birthday to me! A visit from one of my favorite leading ladies, Crystal' Heartbroken: Fans lay flowers as a tribute to Robin Williams outside his California home following his death . The couple were sleeping in separate bedrooms, Susan admitted, because Robin was having trouble sleeping and would talk loudly in his sleep. The last time she saw him was around 10.30pm on August 11 and said he seemed 'excited'. According to the report, Robin had experienced Parkinson's symptoms since 2011. He had a tremor in his left arm and movement in his left hand had slowed. He had recently started taking Levodopa to treat the symptoms.

"He won Bolton’s penalty and Fabrice Muamba called him the best player on the pitch, but who is Zach Clough? He’s a 19-year-old attacking midfielder who recently graduated from Bolton’s academy. Zach Clough (middle) impressed for Bolton in their narrow FA Cup defeat against Liverpool . David Wheater heaps praise on Bolton youngster Zach Clough . What’s his story? Clough only graduated to professional football this year, making his debut on January 3 against Wigan in the FA Cup. He capped a dream debut with a late goal to eliminate the 2013 champions, and then grabbed two more on his second appearance for the club — a 2-2 draw against Wolves last Saturday. His performances have been so impressive that his excited nan, Mavis, called up a local radio station to sing his praises. Softly spoken, Clough says it like it is. He attended Audenshaw School, which boasts singer Mick Hucknall as a former pupil, he was a promising cricketer as a boy and wears black boots. There's certainly a lot to like about the teenager from Denton. 'He's not a ragamuffin,' said manager Lennon. 'He's polite and he's well mannered but he's a hungry boy and he just loves playing his football.' A Manchester City fan, Clough still tries to sneak across to Eastlands with his father Paul to ogle the skills of David Silva and Samir Nasri, who play in his favoured position 'at the top of a diamond or in the hole'. The 19-year-old accurately lobs the ball over former Bolton keeper Ali Al-Habsi to score against Wigan . What type of player is he? Clough looks slight - standing at just 5ft 7in - but is built like a light-welterweight boxer and can pack a punch. Clough certainly has plenty of tenacity and energy to go with his talent on the ball. Bolton boss Neil Lennon has likened his ‘street kid’ style to a young Wayne Rooney — lauding his ability to ‘fall over, cut his knee, wipe it off and get on with it.’ His Bolton team-mates have also recognised the 19-year-old's durability. 'He won’t freeze,' said gnarled 6ft 5ins defender David Wheater ahead of the Liverpool match on Wednesday. 'He always wants the ball, even in training where I kick him quite a lot. 'Sometimes you can kick the younger lads and they go away but he wants the ball all the time. He’ll be good against Liverpool. He won’t be thinking about what stage he is playing on. He just wants to play football, every game is the same for him. It wouldn't surprise me if he does score or if he gets man of the match – he’s that good.' He was certainly in contention following another effective display. Clough wasn't afraid to get stuck in throughout Bolton's FA Cup fourth round tie against Liverpool . The Bolton boss is a big fan of Clough, who has scored three goals in two appearances for the Trotters . Anything else I should know? Born on March 8, 1995, the same day that Bolton teammate Emile Heskey made his debut for Leicester City, Clough has already joined an illustrious band; he scored on his Bolton debut, as have Heskey, Daniel Sturridge, Andy Walker and a certain Nat Lofthouse. The omens are good and Clough is happy to aim high. 'Three goals in two games has been a great start but hopefully it will be 10 goals in 10 games,' he said before the Liverpool game. 'I’ve been popping in goals for a long time. I’ve been here since I was eight years old, and worked under some great coaches. And in yet another indication of his modesty, he added: 'Being involved against Liverpool in a game live on Match of the Day would be a dream come true. What a game it’s going to be – I’ve worked hard to get that sort of moment. The whole nation will be watching.'","Zach Clough played 72 minutes for Bolton against Liverpool on Tuesday .

Sir Alex Ferguson insists he had nothing to do with the process that saw David Moyes sacked by Manchester United in April and admits to feeling ‘confused’ when he found out. Ferguson chose Moyes as his successor at Old Trafford less than a year earlier and in the updated version of his autobiography he says he was in the dark over the decision to sack his fellow Scot.

'I was unsure what was happening at that exact moment,' he writes in relation to the text. Ferguson adds: 'I spoke to [chief executive] Ed Woodward when I got back and established a final decision had been made.' On Moyes, Ferguson also insists that the former Everton manager has 'plenty going for him' as he continues his search for a new job. He said in his republished autobiography, released on Thursday but leaked on Tuesday: 'On his record it will show that he was selected to be manager of Manchester United, which is a rare occurrence.' Moyes finished seventh with Manchester United last season, and when the Scot left United had the worst home record since 1978 and the lowest points total in their Premier League history. He still had a better win percentage than Sir Matt Busby, but lost 11 games as United boss, conceding 40 goals in his 34 games. He was sacked on April 22, two days after a 2-0 defeat to Everton in the Premier League.

"Of all people, one would expect Fabrice Muamba to believe in the power of luck. In March, football fans around the world watched in horror as the Bolton Wanderers player fell to the ground during an FA Cup match against Spurs and lay motionless. He suffered a cardiac arrest and his heart stopped for 78 minutes. The nation was joined in prayer  but privately even the most optimistic person did not expect him to survive. Yet, against seemingly insurmountable odds, he did. Just five per cent of those who suffer a similar attack will live. And, more than that, the 24-year-old has made a full recovery.  Unbelievably lucky? Not so. ‘First aid saved my life,’ he says. ‘There is no such thing as luck when it comes to a cardiac arrest – it’s about having the right people there at the right time. I wouldn’t be here now if it wasn’t for the first aid I had been given in the moments after I collapsed. Quick action: Fabrice Muamba is seen receiving first aid after he suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch during an FA Cup game . ‘I can’t express how grateful I still am for the care I received.’ Last week, Fabrice was guest of honour at the St John Ambulance First Aid Awards ceremony. Launched last year by The Mail on Sunday, it recognises the bravery and courage of everyday heroes whose first-aid skills save lives. Fabrice says he couldn’t be a better example of why everyone should have at least a basic knowledge of first aid. When his heart stopped, the medics who rushed on to the pitch could be seen desperately administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) – manually breathing into the mouth and then pumping the chest to keep the blood flowing around his body and oxygen going to his brain. The footballer was then given three shocks using a defibrillator, but his heart still did not start. It was only after being transferred to an ambulance and receiving 12 more electrical shocks that his heart started working again. In the months that followed, doctors were astounded as he recovered without suffering any brain damage. The speed of his treatment on the pitch was key: for every minute of delay in starting CPR, the chance of survival reduces by ten per cent. In Fabrice’s case, he was treated within seconds of his heart stopping. Tribute: Fabrice with Lee Craven, right, who saved his friend Max Davies, left, and was praised at the St John Ambulance First Aid Awards . He remembers nothing of the collapse or the days after, but he does recall when he was first able to go to the lavatory normally. ‘My kidney wasn’t working as I had been down for so long, but one day it just kicked in and my urine was normal. I couldn’t go before that, which was uncomfortable, but when I could go again it was better than any present I could have been given.’ Muamba has had a pacemaker fitted to correct the irregular heartbeat that caused his collapse and  he has been forced to retire from professional football. ‘I am happy though,’ he says. ‘I am getting better every day and I now spend my time doing different things, such as being with my friends and family.’ Sue Killen, chief executive of St John Ambulance, says Fabrice’s case epitomises how vital first aid training is. ‘His incident raised public awareness of the need for first aid to a new level,’ she said. ‘As the tragedy unfolded on TV, millions saw how important it can be in an emergency. Fabrice was lucky he was surrounded by people who knew first aid, who were the difference between life and death. But it shouldn’t be the case that people are lucky to have a first-aider nearby – it’s a simple skill everyone can learn and we hope these awards encourage people to take that first step.’ Also presenting an award last week was Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne, who realised the value of first aid recently. Last month, the 63-year-old suffered excruciating chest pains and collapsed on to the floor of his office. His secretary walked in and quickly dialled 999. His staff, who are trained in first aid, knew he had collapsed into the recovery position, had a regular heartbeat and was lucid, so should be left where he was. Within minutes an ambulance had arrived and he was taken to hospital where his heart was monitored with an ECG. ‘I thought it was a heart attack or a stroke but it was a panic attack,’ says Bannatyne. ‘I am going through a stressful divorce. If I have to sell part of the business to pay for it, people will lose their jobs. Some of them are single parents and it’s a very difficult time.’ Scare: Shocked Tottenham Hotspurs and Bolton Wanderers players watch Fabrice Muamba being treated by medical staff after his collapse . Saviours: Consultant cardiologist Andrew Deaner leads the ways as Fabrice Muamba is taken off the pitch in March this year . Bannatyne, who runs a chain of gyms and hotels, says he reduced  his working hours slightly following the scare, but has now returned to his regular schedule and works out with a personal trainer. He says: ‘My staff are trained in first aid but I’d never realised how important it was to be surrounded by people confident in a crisis.’ For thousands of Britons there  is no such quick recovery. Up to 140,000 people who die each year  might have been saved if those around them had known first aid. The Guy Evans Award was set up to honour those who have used first aid for the first time with remarkable results. In 1998, Guy, 17, died after a motorbike crash because he was not given basic first aid to ensure he could breathe. His mother, Beth Chesney-Evans, has since campaigned for everyone – especially the young – to learn first-aid skills, and was instrumental in setting up the SJA Awards. On Monday, Mail on Sunday readers voted for Lee Craven, 17, to be crowned winner of this year’s  trophy. Lee, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, saved the life of his friend Max Davies who had fallen through the ice of a local canal. Full-recovery: Fabrice Muamba's miraculous recovery has progressed so well that he is set to take part in the Christmas special of Strictly Come Dancing . The two had just left a house-party when Max ventured on to what he thought was a road, but was actually a grey, frozen canal. Within seconds he had fallen through the ice and was pulled away from the hole he had created. Lee quickly ran down the bank, wrapped his legs around a tree stump and leaned across the ice, plunging his upper body below the water and reaching out into the darkness until he felt his friend’s fingertips. After hauling him out, he noticed Max was showing signs of hypothermia, so he took him back to the  house and warmed him up slowly – a trick that prevents the body from going into shock. ‘I just did what I had been trained to do,’ Lee says. ‘I felt calm and knew I had to get down there and get Max out. I’m really pleased I won this award – I think first aid should be a basic skill that everyone has.’ The Workplace Hero Award was given to Tesco security guard Graeme Beddows, whose quick thinking saved the life of a choking baby. After performing back-slaps and removing the obstruction from the infant’s mouth, he calmly handed the child back to its father and returned to work. Other winners included Chris Richards, a retired firefighter who saved the life of a fellow football player whose heart stopped while playing in a charity match in Devon. ‘We want to thank The Mail on Sunday’s readers for their incredible support for our awards,’ says Killen. ‘Without them we wouldn’t be where we are today. All the entrants are winners in our eyes, and their incredible stories prove there is no greater gift than to give someone their life back.’","Bolton Wanderers player was only given a five per cent chance to survive .

"The amount of space junk orbiting earth has reached a 'tipping point' where continual collisions are thickening the already dense cloud shrouding the Earth, a Nasa report has revealed. In practical terms, it means that the amount of junk floating around the planet will make it increasingly difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet, effectively trapping us on earth. It also poses 'potentially catastrophic risk' to astronauts, satellites and the International Space Station. Surrounded: This Nasa image shows the wider circle of space junk surrounding Earth, as well as the tighter cluster of objects in low orbit around the planet . Junk cloud: Left, this computer-generated Nasa graphic shows objects of space junk in Earth's orbit that are currently being tracked - hundreds of thousands more are not being tracked - while, right, the size of the objects has been exaggerated in this CG image to add emphasis to the threat . Since the first object, Sputnik One, . was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of . perhaps tens of millions of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. It is estimated that there are 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit. The picture above shows a ball of twisted metal, thought to be fallen space junk, on a farm in Queensland, Australia, in 2008. 'We've lost control of the environment,' said retired Nasa senior scientist Donald Kessler, who authored the report. There are 22,000 objects in orbit . that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless . more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and . valuable satellites. It is estimated that there are as may . as 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit, traveling at . speeds of up to 22,000 mph. Several solutions to retrieving or . moving the space junk were put forward in an earlier report called . 'Catcher's Mitt', by a Defense Department science think-tank. It mentions giant cosmic versions of . harpoons, nets, tethers, magnets and even a giant dish or . umbrella-shaped device that would sweep up tiny pieces of debris. While the new report does not recommend using the technology, Mr Kessler said it is needed. He favours one private company's idea . of a satellite that is armed with nets that could be sprung on wayward . junk. Attached to the net is an electromagnetic tether that could either . pull the junk down to a point where it would burn up harmlessly or . boost it to safer orbit. The latest evaluation report says: . 'Scenarios uncovered conclude that the current orbital debris . environment has already reached a 'tipping point'. 'That is, the amount of debris... Currently in orbit has reached a threshold where it will continually . collide with itself, further increasing the population of orbital . debris. 'The increase will lead to . corresponding increases in spacecraft failures, which will only create . more feedback into the system, increasing the debris population growth . rate.' The report, Limiting future collision . risk to spacecraft, was commissioned by Nasa last April to evaluate its . programmes on 'space junk', officially known as MMOD (Micrometeoroids . and Orbital Debris). While it says that the current U.S. programmes have used their resources well, it notes that there was a 10 . year-plan between 1981 and 1991 to combat the problem, there has been no . concerted effort since 1991.

Since the space age began 54 years . ago, civilization has littered the area just above Earth's atmosphere . with leftover boosters and other parts that come off during launches, as . well as old satellites. When scientists noticed that this . could be a problem, they came up with agreements to limit new space junk . and those plans had been working. Those agreements are intended to make sure what is sent into orbit eventually falls back to Earth and burns up. But two events in the past four years . — a 2007 Chinese anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash-in-orbit . of two satellites — put so much new junk in space that everything . changed, the report said. The widely criticized Chinese test . used a missile to smash an aging weather satellite into 150,000 pieces . of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground, . the report said. 'Those two single events doubled the . amount of fragments in Earth orbit and completely wiped out what we had . done in the last 25 years,' said Kessler. All that junk that means something has to be done, 'which means you have to look at cleaning space,' said Mr Kessler.","'We've lost control of the environment' warns author of new report .

"Paul Rosolie allowed himself to be eaten alive by a giant snake in a documentary for the Discovery Channel . The Amazon boasts the world’s greatest variety of wildlife, but no one had ever seen anything quite like this. Gliding through the dense, waterlogged vegetation was a 20ft long, 18 ½ st green anaconda — one of the world’s most terrifying creatures. Moving tentatively towards it was a man on his hands and knees pretending to be a wild boar — clad head to toe in a black armoured suit slathered in pig’s blood. Paul Rosolie was on a terrifying mission: to be eaten alive by the biggest and mightiest snake on Earth. The 27-year-old wildlife presenter and his ten-strong team had spent 60 days struggling up to the headwaters of the world’s largest river, battling electric eels, floods and poachers. Finally, they’d found a snake that might be big enough to swallow Rosolie whole as the cameras rolled. Tomorrow night in America, the Discovery Channel will broadcast the result of his experiment in its show Eaten Alive, despite protests from conservationists on both sides of the Atlantic. The documentary — to be aired in the UK on Friday — will follow his stomach-churning quest into the very belly of the beast. The channel has refused to say exactly what ensued after the snake wrapped Rosolie in its coils. But he has explained what drove him to such extremes of apparent lunacy — and told of his fear as he realised the snake had accepted his invitation to subject him to one of the natural world’s most lingering deaths. ‘I wanted to do something to grab people’s attention to the plight of the disappearing rainforests, something completely crazy,’ he told me this week. ‘Everything else has been tried.’ Whether his idea will ignite a debate about saving the forests or just terrify people even more about snakes remains to be seen. Rosolie, who has written the well-received book Mother of God about exploring the region, says anacondas are misunderstood. He describes the species as a predator at the top of the food chain, with no natural foes except human beings — who wrongly see the snakes as a threat. They are in fact shy creatures, but they can be deadly when roused. Reaching up to 30ft in length and 39 st, they live in or around water and are far thicker than the pythons of Africa and Asia. They are not venomous but boast powerful jaws attached by elastic ligaments. Rosolie had already been bitten by one anaconda and seized by another — it took five people to pry it off him, by which time it had broken one of his ribs. The naturalist donned a crush-proof suit for the stunt which has been criticised by animal rights groups . His bid to be eaten and, of course, rescued before perishing, was filmed last spring but the documentary took two years to prepare. Its makers’ main task was to ensure Rosolie didn’t end up like the snake’s usual meals: crushed until he was asphyxiated. Anacondas will bite their prey, such as wild pigs, with teeth that curve backwards — preventing the animal from breaking away. Then they’ll pull it into water if they can, wrapping it in coils that crush its bones to make swallowing it easier. The power of a giant anaconda (they are always female, the males are much smaller) is awe-inspiring. The force of constriction is equal to having a nine-ton bus on your chest, according to Rosolie. Happily, they rarely encounter people. But they will go after any prey that they can subdue and swallow. ‘An anaconda can stretch to three times its own girth, so a 20ft snake would easily encompass my shoulders,’ says Rosolie. For his experiment, he needed a lightweight but super-strong carbon-fibre suit to protect him from being crushed. One was created by a team of engineers, who used a 3D scan of his body to make sure it fit his 5ft 9in frame closely. It was also streamlined so he’d be less likely to damage the snake’s insides, and — crucially for Rosolie — its material would resist the anaconda’s digestive fluids. The sealed suit was finished with built-in cameras and a radio mic so he could communicate with his watching team. Doctors also made him swallow a capsule that would transmit his vital signs in case he was unable — or unwilling — to signal he was in trouble. ‘They knew I’m the type who’ll say “I’m fine, I’m fine…” until I’m dead,’ says Rosolie. ‘We had to make sure I didn’t get crushed, but the suit took care of that. But if I was eaten, we were worried what would happen to my breathing system because I could have suffocated very quickly.’ His face mask was connected to a crush-proof hose that trailed behind him, leading to an three-hour oxygen supply. Another hose removed the air he exhaled so it wouldn’t leak into the snake’s stomach and kill it. Next, the team had to find a suitable snake. They eventually encountered a vast beast in the dense foliage of the Peruvian Amazon. Then they had to ensure that it ate him. Pig blood was slathered on the suit to make it smell more like prey. But Rosolie says: ‘I had to provoke a defence response from the snake and turn it into a predator. I got down on all fours to make contact with it and simply let it bite me.’ The 27-year-old would not reveal the result of the experiment but said he has not yet fully recovered . Snakes almost always eat their prey headfirst so it goes down more smoothly. Rosolie was no exception. ‘She nailed me right in the face, and the last thing I remember was her mouth open wide, straight in my face, and everything went black,’ he tells me. ‘I went limp and let it constrict. All the while I was just thinking: “Eat, eat, eat!” ’ He describes the crushing feeling of the constriction as like being caught under a powerful wave. Incredibly, it lasted for more than an hour. ‘She wrapped around me and I felt my suit cracking and my arms ripping out of their sockets,’ he says. ‘It was absolutely terrifying.’ Enveloped in the snake’s coils, he couldn’t see anything but he was able to radio back to his team to say he was alive. They had agreed that once he was in past his waist, they would pull him out before it became too difficult to extract him without damaging either him or the snake. There were doctors and vets on hand, he says, and his wife Gowri, who’s also a naturalist, was watching too. ‘She was keeping everybody else relaxed, saying: “Paul will be fine.” ’ She wasn’t entirely correct, though. Rosolie will not reveal until the programme airs how much of him was actually swallowed — but he says the snake ‘beat the s***’ out of him and came off a lot better from the encounter than he did. Months later, he is still not entirely recovered. He has no problems about people calling his escapade a stunt, saying: ‘The whole idea is to shock people.’ But he hadn’t expected the volume of hate mail and even death threats he’s attracted from animal-rights campaigners around the world. The campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) judged from early reports of the experiment that the snake was ‘tormented and suffered for the sake of ratings’. The anaconda would have expended valuable energy in swallowing Rosolie and then regurgitating him, it argued. And Dr Ian Stephen of the British Herpetological Society, which covers the study of reptiles and amphibians, was ‘horrified’ by the project. ‘It demonstrates a complete disregard for animal welfare of the highest degree,’ he said. ‘It would have been stressed beyond belief.’ If it’s any comfort to his critics, so, surely, was Rosolie.","Paul Rosolie wanted to bring attention to the plight of the rainforest .

"This is the incredible moment a pair of bloodied tigers slashed each other with their claws in a dramatic fight over territory. The dramatic battle was caught on camera at the world famous 'Tiger Canyons' in the Londolozi private game reserve in Pretoria, South Africa. The clash erupted after one of the tigers delivered a vicious blow to the neck of its rival. In the thick of it: This is the incredible moment a pair of bloodied tigers slashed each other with their claws in dramatic fight over territory . Believing it to be dead, the tiger released its opponent from its jaws but instead of the fight coming to a grizzly end, the two broke out in a second, even more savage struggle. German photographer, Marion Vollborn, captured the predatory pair while on safari tour. Ms Vollborn said 'The day before I took these pictures, our group spotted two male tigers pacing along each of their own territory borders. 'There had been a female tiger who had mated with both males and there was a very tense atmosphere but nothing had yet happened. 'In the morning we all suddenly heard a loud roar and we drove immediately towards the noise.

"On the concourse overlooking Wembley Way, a six-metre high bronze statue of Bobby Moore proudly watched over the 80,000 England supporters who filed into the national football stadium on Saturday. When the arena was officially opened in March 2007, the FA promised us that this magnificent structure was, first and foremost, to be used for football. We believed them. On Saturday, as fans made their way past our only World Cup-winning captain, the ugly truth was confirmed when the lighting rigs were wheeled off the Wembley pitch. The pitch quickly disintegrated under foot during England's Euro 2016 qualifying clash at Wembley . Wembley's pitch was in a poor condition after the Dallas Cowboys' victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars . The pitch looked heavy and was cutting up after a day of steady rain as the Slovenians trained . The departing circus, in this case the NFL, had left their calling card on a playing surface once deemed sacrosanct. For a few million bucks, you can trample all over Wembley Stadium and, yes, sod the consequences. What a pity for Roy Hodgson. Joe Hart was among the first out, heading over to one half of the pitch to read the words ‘NFL International Series’ stretching, almost, from the byline to the halfway line. Behind each goal the emblems of the Dallas Cowboys and Jacksonville Jaguars, the two NFL teams who threw each other around in the mud last weekend, remained. When the FA send Wayne Rooney the pictures of him receiving his golden cap in a glass cabinet from Sir Bobby Charlton, the England centurion will notice the NFL regulation 10-yard lines painted on the playing surface. The Wembley pitch before England's clash with Slovenia, with non-football markings still clearly visible . The NFL markings were apparent throughout the pitch at Wembley during the Euro 2016 qualifier . Loose dirt flies flies up at Wembley as Dallas Cowboys' Dwayne Harris returns the ball against Jacksonville . So what happens to the Wembley pitch now? After next Sunday’s women’s match between England and Germany, the surface will be ‘rested’ (receive some serious TLC) until the Capital One Cup final on March 1. Will the pitch take any more poundings before crucial Euro 2016 qualifiers? That would be a big, loud yes. Two rugby union World Cup fixtures (New Zealand v Argentina and Ireland v Romania) and an NFL match are scheduled in the three weeks leading up to the final home qualifier, against Estonia on October 9. The NFL clash between Miami Dolphins and New York Jets is on October 4. Wembley bean-counters would point to the fact that gridiron games sell out instantly, while England football takes a bit longer. How about switching international fixtures away from Wembley? Sorry, no can do. The FA agreed a 10-year deal to use the stadium and that does not run out until 2017. Tickets for 10 years were sold on the back of the agreement so Roy Hodgson’s team will have to lump it for a little longer. They were not for the ‘five-yard furies’, as Roy Hodgson has taken to calling his energetic young players, to press the Slovenians in this Euro 2016 qualifier. A week was never going to be enough time for Wembley’s ground staff to scrub off the paint and there isn’t a lighting rig in the world that can promote grass growth at warp speed. These images, from a venue that is still regarded as the home of football by many visiting players, were beamed around the world on Saturday afternoon. How embarrassing. This is a world-class sporting facility and, if the FA are to put on events with 82,305 congregating at a stadium predominantly built for football, then the team and head coach deserve an elite playing surface. The excuse that the wrong topsoil had been used is complete bunkum. What it has come down to, as Hodgson reluctantly accepted on Saturday evening after his team had beaten Slovenia 3-1, is money. ‘You can’t expect me, as a football coach, to make claims that Wembley should be used for NFL, rugby etcetera,’ he admitted. ‘On the other hand I am pragmatic enough to realise this is a factor in Wembley life . . . the FA have financial decisions, but as a football person I have to be in the camp that says I would like to see this place lying fallow virtually all the year, apart from seven or eight occasions.’ Roy Hodgson will be disappointed with the FA's decision to host rugby and NFL matches at Wembley . It will already be on Hodgson’s radar that next year the pitch will be churned up when two rugby World Cup group games take place on September 20 and 27. On October 4, the NFL circus comes to town again when Miami Dolphins face New York Jets. The football team, assuming they haven’t been forgotten about by then, play Estonia in a Euro 2016 qualifier at the stadium five days later. Hodgson will be hopping mad. What we have now is a cash cow, a useful vehicle for the FA as they chase the dough before those expensive debentures run out in a few years’ time. Until then the England team, fighting to restore their reputation after a dreadful showing at the World Cup in Brazil, will have to make do. ‘I can only say that I work for the FA,’ added Hodgson. ‘They make the decisions they have to make.’ In this case, they have sacrificed the national sport.","The FA said Wembley was going to be used primarily for football .

They also reportedly include Nashville star Hayden Panettiere, singer Avril Lavigne and actress-turned-fashion designer Mary-Kate Olson. It comes just three weeks after naked photos of actress Jennifer Lawrence and '100 other stars', including supermodel Kate Upton and actress Aubrey Plaza, were published online. Although most of the latest victims were named on an original list of targeted celebrities, posted by a hacker to the anonymous image-sharing forum 4chan last month, Kim, also 33, was not.

Victims: The latest wave of naked images are also alleged to feature actress Vanessa Hudgens (left) and American goalkeeper Hope Solo (right). They were reportedly posted to image-sharing forum 4chan and Reddit . Targeted: Kaley Cuoco (left), who plays Penny in The Big Bang Theory (right), was named as a victim last month . According to TMZ, the images were reportedly uploaded to 4chan and Reddit, but the latter quickly removing them due to its stringent policy on hacked photographs being shared on the site. While a representative for Kim declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline, the snaps which allegedly feature her have garnered much attention. They show a woman who resembles the star taking nude selfies in a bathroom setting. It is not the first time Kim, who is married to rapper Kanye West, has had to deal with racy material being leaked to the public. In 2007, her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray-J was published online. The reality star filed a lawsuit against the tape's distributors, Vivid Enetrtainment, which was finalled dropped when she settled for $5 million. Actress: Hayden Panettiere was also allegedly a victim in the latest online leak of naked celebrity photos . Another victim: According to E! Online, nude photos allegedly showing singer Avril Lavigne (pictured) and actresses Leelee Sobieski and Lake Bell have also been uploaded online. Posing: It is not the first time Kim (pictured, right, in a Twitter image), married to Kanye West (left), has had to deal with racy material being leaked to the public. In 2007, her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray-J was leaked . The same year, Vanessa was forced to issue an apology after private photos of her were leaked online at the time she was appearing in Disney's High School Musical 2. According to E! Online, nude photos allegedly showing actresses Leelee Sobieski and Lake Bell were also uploaded online this morning. Three weeks ago, compromising images of dozens of celebrities - including model Cara Delevingne and Jessica Brown Findlay - emerged online after a hacker reportedly gained access to their iCloud accounts and stole their pictures. While it appears that she was unaffected by the attacks, actress Cameron Diaz recently expressed her thoughts on the scandal while in London to promote her latest movie Sex Tape. Scandal: It comes just three weeks after naked photos of actress Jennifer Lawrence (left) and '100 other stars', including supermodel Kate Upton and actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, were published online . Stars: Mary Elizabeth Winstead (left) tweeted that nude photographs of her were taken with her husband 'years ago in the privacy of our home', while actress Aubrey Plaza (right) was also an alleged victim of the leak . Speaking on ITV's This Morning, she said: 'Whoever has done it, they will be caught and made examples of. This can happen to anyone. 'If these guys can do it to this group of people then everyone's vulnerable to it. 'I think that people really need to look at... how would they feel if it happened to them?' The hacking is believed to have been the result of 'a very targeted attack' on celerbrity's ICloud accounts . Last month, actress Kirsten Dunst became the first celebrity to publicly criticize technology giant Apple when she posted a sarcastic message on Twitter. The Spiderman star tweeted 'Thank you iCloud', the day after naked photos of her were published online. Meanwhile, Jennifer Lawrence, a three-time Oscar nominee who won for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, contacted authorities after the images began appearing. 'This is a flagrant violation of privacy,' Lawrence's publicist Liz Mahoney wrote in a statement. 'The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.' Apple has denied that its iCloud system was compromised during the attacks, which were the result of 'a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions'. We take user privacy very seriously and are actively investigating this report,' Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris told MailOnline. The firm, which said it was 'outraged' by the security breach, has now advised worried customers to update their accounts with a 'strong' password and enable two-step verification. 4Chan is an image-based forum where users can post photos and videos anonymously, as well as comment on others' posts. Registration is not required, nor possible. The site is split into various boards, each with their own specific content and guidelines. These include content on music, photography, gaming, comics, fashion and images of celebrities, such as Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and Kim Kardashian. Forum: In the latest hack, the nude celebrity photos were posted on 4chan, before being shared on forums on Reddit. Above, 'The Fappening' subreddit allows thousands of subscribers to view the graphic pictures . Its main board, called 'Random', features minimal rules on what can be posted. It is often where controversial images and videos are uploaded by users. When it launched in 2003, the site was used to post photos and discuss Japanese anime. However, it quickly expanded, and is now linked to various internet subcultures and activism. It has also been linked to a number of high-profile hacks. Last month, actress Kirsten Dunst became the first celebrity to publicly criticize technology giant Apple when she posted a sarcastic message on Twitter . In 2006, users of 4chan and other websites 'raided' American white nationalist Hal Turner by launching multiple attacks and prank calling his phone-in radio show. Meanwhile, in 2008, the Yahoo email account of Sarah Palin was hacked by an anonymous 4chan user, before posting her password and screenshots on Wikileaks. In the latest hack, the nude celebrity photos were posted on 4chan, before being shared on forums on Reddit and other social networking sites. One such forum, called 'The Fappening', allows thousands of subscribers to view the graphic pictures, provides advice on how to share them online and protects the identity of the unnamed hacker. In a post a few weeks ago, the moderator of the subreddit told users that they must not post any information, true or false, about the identity of the person leaking the photos. He or she wrote: 'If you do that, you will be banned from this subreddit.' The moderator, using the handle 'thefappeningmod', went on to list an array of other domains that subscribers can use to access the nude pictures.

"More than three years after his death, legendary Apple CEO Steve Jobs held an Oakland courtroom transfixed today as attorneys played a video of his testimony in a class-action lawsuit that accuses Apple of inflating prices by locking music lovers into using Apple's iPod players. Looking gaunt and pale, Jobs spoke softly during the deposition he gave six months before his death in October 2011. Despite this, he gave a firm defense of Apple's software, which blocked music from services that competed with Apple's iTunes store. 'We were very scared': Video testimony from Steve Jobs recorded months before his death was today shown in court as Apple is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market. Earlier this week, lawyers claimed it had deliberately deleted rivals' song from iPods from 2007 to 2009. But, the tech giant has challenged the suit after presenting evidence suggesting the plaintiffs' models of iPod may be invalid . 'We were very scared' of the prospect that hackers could break Apple's security system, Jobs said, because that might jeopardize Apple's contracts with music recording companies that didn't want their songs to be pirated. 'We would get nasty emails from the labels,' he added. Jobs was known for having a short temper. But he seemed unruffled when an attorney for the plaintiffs read part of an email in which the Apple CEO demanded that a record company executive publicly apologize for praising rival RealNetworks for producing software that would make songs from the RealNetworks store play on Apple's iPods. Dressed in his trademark black turtleneck and blue jeans, Jobs appeared impatient at times and swiveled in his chair during the session, which was recorded at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. He said he didn't remember why he was upset with the recording executive. But he acknowledged that he had proposed language for an Apple press release that condemned RealNetworks as a 'hacker.' 'We are stunned that Real has adopted the tactics and ethics of a hacker to break into the iPod, and we are investigating the implications of their actions' under federal law, the release said. Apple used anti-piracy software that ensured only songs from its own iTunes store could be played on its iPod devices. Apple CEO Steve Jobs stands next to a projection of an iPod Nano at an Apple announcement in San Francisco. Dressed in his trademark black turtleneck and blue jeans, Jobs appeared impatient at times and swivelled in his chair during the interview session shown in court, which was recorded at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. Apple is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market, and only earlier this week lawyers claimed the firm deliberately deleted rivals' song from iPods. The case went to trial in California this week, after being filed a decade ago. Plaintiffs are claiming that Apple's restrictive software froze out competitors and allowed Apple to sell iPods at inflated prices. They are seeking $350 million (£224m) in damages, which could be tripled if the jury finds Apple broke federal anti-trust law. Apple stopped using the particular software in question in 2009, which means the lawsuit only covers iPod models bought between September 2006 and March 2009. On Wednesday, the prosecution told the court that  Apple deleted songs from iPods that had been bought from rival music stores. Each time an Apple user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their devices, between 2007 and 2009, the tech firm  urged them to restore the players to factory settings. And the lawyers claimed this was a deliberate move to wipe the rival files, and cause the users' music libraries to 'blow up.' But Apple insisted the move was a legitimate security measure. Now, Apple has said new evidence shows the two women named as plaintiffs may not have bought iPod models covered by the lawsuit. Attorneys for a group of consumers and iPod resellers contend say that froze rival device-makers out of the market, allowing Apple to sell iPods at inflated prices. The plaintiffs are seeking $350 million in damages, which could be tripled if the jury agrees Apple violated antitrust rules. Jurors saw the video on the fourth day of trial in a case that has been rocked by an unusual development. Apple attorneys late Thursday said neither of the women named as plaintiffs purchased iPods equipped with the restrictive software during the timeframe covered by the lawsuit, which is September 2006 to March 2009. Apple lawyer William Isaacson formally asked the judge on Friday to dismiss the case because the two women can't claim to have suffered the harm alleged in the suit. The motion came after plaintiff Marianna Rosen testified Wednesday and, in response to questions, showed an iPod that she said she bought in 2008. Isaacson said Apple checked the serial number later in the day and found it was actually purchased in July 2009. Attorneys who brought the suit had already conceded that iPods purchased by the other plaintiff, Melanie Wilson, weren't covered by the suit. They agreed Friday to drop Wilson from the case, but plaintiffs' attorney Bonny Sweeney said Rosen is still eligible to proceed because she has receipts showing she bought two other iPods in September 2008. When Isaacson countered that Apple's records show those two iPods were purchased by Rosen's husband's law firm, Sweeney said Rosen was authorized to use the firm's credit card for her own purchases. The judge asked Sweeney to submit a formal response to Isaacson's arguments over the weekend, but Rogers didn't say when she'll make a decision. Claimants say Apple's (co-founder Steve Job is pictured) restrictive software froze out competitors. Apple stopped using the software in 2009, which means the lawsuit only covers models bought until March 2009. But serial numbers show plaintiff Marianna Rosen's iPod was bought in July 2009 . Apple insists its move was a legitimate security measure. Security director Augustin Farrugia said in court that his company was protecting users from hackers and malware by removing MP3s downloaded from outside of iTunes. Now, Apple has said new evidence shows the two women named as plaintiffs may not have bought iPod models covered by the lawsuit. Plaintiffs are claiming Apple's restrictive software froze out competitors and allowed Apple to sell iPods at inflated prices. They are seeking $350 million (£224m) in damages, which could be tripled if the jury finds Apple broke federal anti-trust law. Apple stopped using the particular software in question in 2009, which means the lawsuit only covers iPod models bought between September 2006 and March 2009. This means the colourful iPod Nano, released in September 2009, and later generations of the devices are not covered.","Apple is accused of abusing its  position in the digital music player market .

"Chris Martin is set to join Jennifer Lawrence in London at the world premiere of her new film Mockingjay on Monday night, MailOnline has been told. The Coldplay frontman, 37 - who reportedly split from the stunning Oscar winner late last month - will accompany the actress to the event, but will NOT join her on the red carpet. Instead, a film source said he will do his 'usual, fly-under-the-radar thing that he used to do with Gwyneth Paltrow'. The singer is expected at the premiere of the latest Hunger Games movie days after it was reported that Jennifer had dumped him. Is it back on? Chris Martin looked contemplative in LA on Tuesday. Sources say that while Jennifer Lawrence is being 'uncharacteristically quiet', the Coldplay frontman will join her in London on Monday night . However, the actress was seen arriving his Malibu home on October 27 - just hours after news broke that the couple had split - for what was described as a 'heart to heart' with Martin. She returned three nights later, on Thursday, October 30, and is believed to have been with Martin since the weekend. And a source said: 'They've mostly been holed up at Chris's house, and there were rumors that they were at one of Jen's regular haunts, Chateau Marmont, earlier in the week. 'Jennifer hasn't been talking about it - she's been uncharacteristically quiet about the whole thing. 'Chris is meant to be going with her to London to the Hunger Games world premiere. But he won't make a public appearance.' Coldplay have an art exhibition to benefit the Kids Company charity and European promotion for their Ghost Stories Blu-Ray, so their plans dovetail neatly. It is, the source admitted, a far cry from last week, when Jen was 'adamant it was all over', adding: 'But she tends to move on fast in these matters. 'Her personal life seems to be in flux, but she's not letting all that is happening affect her promotional duties for Mockingjay.' Stunning: Although her love life is in 'flux', Jennifer has a grueling six-week promo stint for Mockingjay ahead of her . Message: Jennifer Lawrence appeared in LA on October 24 grasping an umbrella emblazoned with a one-finger salute . As MailOnline told last week, Jennifer is about to embark on a six-week promotional tour - but 'intense' Martin was keen to spend all this time with her. A friend said: 'There was a discrepancy between how they viewed their relationship, she’s so easy going and he’s quite intense.’ Indeed, Jennifer is said to have left Martin 'completely blindsided' by calling off their four-month romance, as the friend said: ‘Jen is contractually obliged for the next six weeks to promote Mockingjay and she just couldn’t see how it was going to work. ‘ . After London, Jennifer will fly to New York and on to Los Angeles before embarking on a huge promo tour in Asia for Mockingjay. Chris won't join her for the Asian leg, but will see her while she's in London and LA. Heroic: Jennifer Lawrence returns as teen favorite Katniss Everdeen, the heroine from the Hunger Games trilogy .

On Saturday, Jennifer was spotted driving to Martin's Malibu house again. Although one source told People that the pair have indeed split, another insider says they remain an item, adding: 'They're very much together. 'He's very much into her and they're still seeing each other.' Together, still: Sources say Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Martin are still together - despite reports last week that she had dumped him . Spokespeople for Jennifer and Martin have so far declined to comment. As for reports that Jennifer was upset by Martin's continuing closeness to his ex-wife, an insider told People: 'She doesn't give a s**t about Gwyneth [and Chris's relationship],' adding that the star thinks the reports are 'hilarious'.","Jennifer, 24, will attend Mockingjay premiere in London on November 10 .

"Manchester United were not in decline when I left... David Moyes was sacked because his team were too slow . I had nothing to do with David Moyes' sacking . Sir Alex Ferguson reveals he spoke to Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra about their Manchester United futures... but insists he kept 'respectful' distance after he retired . Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed he tried to talk David Moyes into retaining Mike Phelan as Manchester United's assistant manager when he took over at Old Trafford last year. Moyes brought in his own backroom staff when he took over, with Phelan and first-team coach Rene Meulensteen among those leaving the club after Ferguson's 26-and-a-half year reign came to an end. Moyes time at Old Trafford lasted less than a year with many critics citing a lack of succession planning from Ferguson as the main reason for his successor's failures. David Moyes did not take Sir Alex Ferguson's advice and keep Mike Phelan as part of his backroom team . Ferguson thought it would be a good idea for Phelan to stay at United to provide continuity .

But in the new chapters of the latest version of My Autobiography - officially released on Thursday but leaked on Tuesday afternoon, Ferguson insists that everything was in place for Moyes to succeed. Ferguson says: 'Maybe David felt that at such a massive club he had to be sure that all corners were covered in terms of his support system. 'I felt that network was already there, with plenty of great people already in important slots.' Moyes instead chose to bring in his own team with Steve Round, Phil Neville, Chris Woods and Jimmy Lumsden joining him in moving from Everton. Ferguson adds: 'There appears to be an accepted view out there that there was no process. Nonsense. We feel we did everything the right way: quietly, thoroughly, professionally.' Ferguson believes that the former Everton manager did not appreciate just how big United were as a club and had found it 'a massive jump' from Goodison Park to Old Trafford. Ferguson adds in the new edition of his autobiography that Moyes went against United's traditions by adopting a more conservative style of playing. 'The reason for playing at speed was that United players had been accustomed to operating that way,' Ferguson writes. 'If the tempo slowed for any reason, I would be into them at half-time. '""This is not us,"" I would say. Playing with speed never hindered our results. It was our way: energy and determination in the last third of the pitch.'","Man Utd legend Sir Alex Ferguson has updated his autobiography .

"Robin van Persie admitted his late equaliser against Chelsea had felt like a winner. United looked set to lose to Didier Drogba's header - deflected in off Van Persie - until the striker rammed in following Marouane Fellaini's saved header, earning a 1-1 draw. The goal sparked jubilant scenes at Old Trafford and Van Persie told Sky Sports 1: 'In the 93rd minute, 1-0 down at home, it feels so much better as you can see.

Van Persie throws his Manchester United shirt high into the air as he celebrates equalising in the last minute . Van Persie admitted his late leveller had felt like a winner as Man United salvaged a point at home to the Blues . 'I had two early chances when (Thibaut Courtois) made a good save with a blocked shot, and in the second half as well late in the game. I always kept thinking positive, going for the next chance and it fell to my feet.' Fellaini's header came when he was not marked by Branislav Ivanovic - the Chelsea defender who was sent off seconds before. 'Is that so? It makes it even better for us,' Van Persie added. Manchester United took advantage after Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic was sent off by Phil Dowd . 'If you come back in a game like this, the fact is we were 1-0 down and it gives us a boost. If you look at the table we should have won, wanted to win to get the points but we can be happy with a draw.' Asked if United can catch Chelsea, who remain the league leaders, he added: 'Of course we can, there's a long way to go, nine, 10 games played and it's not even halfway. 'In my opinion we are better every day. In training and if you look at games you can see we are comfy on the ball and we are playing better. Now we have to stretch games longer.

'I think we are showing again that we are believing until the end that we can score in spite of if a result is bad. 'It was the same against West Brom (2-1 down), the players are giving everything for me and that was the most pleasing thing I saw today.

"It is not just the unstoppable march of the Premier League or television continually tinkering with kick-off times that threaten the FA Cup but a coiffured former Wales midfielder with a microphone. The FA’s fruitless search to find a sponsor for its showpiece competition really was a waste of time: the top brass at Wembley could just have plastered the name Robbie Savage over the famous trophy instead. He is seemingly everywhere, infiltrating the country’s airwaves, television screens and internet browsers with his peculiar brand of laddish, enthusiastic waffle. Former Wales midfielder Robbie Savage (left) makes a point to fellow pundit Lee Dixon on Match of the Day . On any weekend you can find Savage flitting between BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC television and BT Sport . Paul Scholes (left) was caught muttering an expletive under his breath on Matchday Live with Fletch and Sav . ‘For me’, the Savage catchphrase that introduces every hastily-concocted opinion, has become an intrinsic part of football’s vernacular. We are well past the point of saturation now, worn down by five years of peroxide, fake tan and hyperactivity. Please God, let it end. On any weekend you can find Savage flitting between BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC television and BT Sport and, if that isn’t enough suffering, you can read his bland comments in his red-top newspaper column or on a betting website or BBC Sport’s website. There is no escape from the wall-to-wall scourge of Savage. The poor FA Cup has taken a particular hammering this season from Savage, who likes to pit himself as a man of the people, a hard-working underdog who maximised his talent to take on the big boys, just like the best Cup heroes. Gary Lineker (above) was distinctly unimpressed by Savage’s animated defence of Claudio Yacob’s challenge . 1 - ‘You need to take off your rose-scented glasses’ — Responding to a caller on his Saturday radio phone-in. 2 - ‘Football is easy’ — Insight during Aston Villa’s FA Cup win against Leicester on Sunday. 3 - ‘Outside the box, that’s a free-kick but inside the box, I don’t think it’s a penalty’ — Rewrites the rule book while discussing a contentious decision. 4 - ‘Palacios is stupid’ — The second most booked player in the Premier League slams the style of Wilson Palacios at the World Cup. 5 - ‘Mark crossed every i and dotted every t’ — Defends Mark Hughes after he quit Wales to join Blackburn in September, 2004. Savage’s well-tested formula involves stating something incorrect, over-simplified or blindingly obvious in that harsh, excitable voice and then ramming it home for 90 minutes of painful co-commentary. And yet Planet Robbie does not stop there. Savage also regularly features on Football Focus, 5 Live’s football phone-in 606 and Match of the Day and took part in an FA Cup special edition of the gameshow Pointless. Then there is the fawning, matey vehicle of self-promotion that is Matchday Live with Fletch and Sav, BT Sport’s Saturday morning warm-up show, which takes place against a backdrop that looks like a five-year-old has gone bonkers with a set of neon paints after consuming two bags of Haribo. Nowhere, it seems, is safe from the self-styled ‘Marmite man’ and former Strictly Come Dancing contestant. He dressed up in a canary yellow suit to promote BT’s coverage of transfer deadline day and freely laughed at the mockery that followed the BBC’s decision to put ‘Robbie Savage: Worthington Cup Winner’ alongside the decorated Clarence Seedorf and Thierry Henry at last year’s World Cup. The Welshman competed alongside dancer Ola Jordan in the 2011 season of Strictly Come Dancing . ‘I was most relieved Clarence and Thierry knew who I was,’ Savage later posted on Twitter. But if we hoped the fan on the sofa had gone with the demise of Adrian Chiles, we are to be disappointed. Paul Scholes mouthed an expletive on live television in response to one Savage soliloquy, while Gary Lineker was distinctly unimpressed by the Welshman’s animated defence of West Brom’s Claudio Yacob’s challenge on Chelsea striker Diego Costa in November. ‘Robbie, it was a red card,’ said Lineker, wearily. The former England striker was also quick to mock Savage’s assertion that ‘football’s easy’ during his hopeless stint in the commentary box for the Aston Villa v Leicester Cup tie last weekend. ‘I saw you play, mate. Is it really?’ added Lineker. Savage, though, sees this as ‘banter’. He appears to revel in it, just as he happily rebuts the deluge of Twitter abuse that comes his way after every television, radio, online or newspaper appearance. But then Savage would prefer people to talk about him in any way rather than not at all, even if his desire for popularity sometimes verges on the desperate. ‘I’ve always wanted to be liked,’ he said in a recent interview with The Daily Telegraph. Savage dressed up in a canary yellow suit to promote BT’s coverage of transfer deadline day . The thing about Marmite, though, is that somebody must like it. Savage, now 40, has 1.4million Twitter followers yet it is a struggle to find vocal supporters outside the band of radio and TV executives who adore him for his undoubted work ethic and willingness to make a complete prat of himself. The gigs, after all, just keep on coming. Savage won the Sony DAB Rising Star Award in 2011, receiving more votes in the public poll than any previous recipient of the prize. Remarkably, it is also understood Savage scores favourably in focus groups. Sky, ITV and talkSPORT must have spent a fortune planting punters in these audience feedback sessions or else the participants are all wearing their hero’s brand of ‘rose-scented glasses’, as he once famously remarked. Savage did not impress with his hopeless stint in the commentary box for the Aston Villa vs Leicester Cup tie . There must, after all, surely be something better than this. Why are we subjected to Savage every time we turn on the radio or television? There should of course be room for football pundits who do not take themselves too seriously, but their primary purpose is to inform and explain and Savage rarely does either. Those close to him say he is a decent, well-meaning bloke who does a lot of charity work and works incredibly hard, but that does not mean we want to listen to him rattle on for 90 minutes or that we care what he has to say at half-time, either. Volume of opinion does not compensate for lack of substance.","On any weekend you can find Savage flitting between BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC television and BT Sport .

"The son of TV mogul Mark Burnett is recovering after being treated for a brain tumor. Cameron Burnett, 16, underwent surgery for the tumor last month, with his family and friends calling for prayers online. Mark, 54 - dubbed the father of reality TV - has made a reported $86 million fortune after bringing hits including The Apprentice, Survivor, The Voice and miniseries The Bible to our screens. Cameron's older brother James and his mother Dianne detailed the crisis they were swept into, as James wrote: 'We need all the love and prayers we can...as my brother  recovers from surgery. Close: Mark Burnett stands between his sons, Cameron (left) and James (right) on a climbing expedition. After Cameron was diagnosed with a brain tumor, his brother posted the picture with the message: 'Top of the mountain, you can climb this one too' Birthday boy: Cameron Burnett celebrates his 16th birthday in October with his mom Dianne . 'They had to remove a growth in his pituitary gland which is located right under the brain, and has apparently been growing for the past ten years.' James said Cameron had gone through a nine-hour surgery, but still 'managed to crack a laugh', calling him: 'A strong man', and telling him: 'Cam, I love you.' Dianne, Mark's first wife, wrote on Facebook late last month:  'A new day. What we take for granted saying the simple words I love you came from Cameron's lips today. I am feeling so blessed. My heart filled with love and joy. Thank you God.' Cameron was welcomed home earlier this month and today, Dianne told MailOnline: 'Cameron's doing much better, he's going to be absolutely perfect. 'He is going to have some recovery time, but it won't be very long.' Multi-millionaire Mark, 54, is a Brit who found fame and fortune after moving to the States in 1982. He had his two sons James and Cameron with his second wife Dianne. And he married actress and producer Roma Downey, a fellow Brit, in 2007. Roma has a daughter called Reilly from her first marriage.

He was named one of Time's most influential people in the world today and has turned his major talents to the world of Christian entertainment. His History Channel miniseries, The Bible, won 13 million viewers when it debuted last year. So far it has been seen by more than 100 million viewers globally. Mark and his wife, Roma Downey, then released the movie Son of God, which grossed $68 million at the global box office. The couple is now helping Paramount and MGM make a big-budget remake of Ben-Hur and working on a sequel to The Bible, titled A.D. The couple have frequently  talked about their faith and both want the bible to be taught in public school in the US. Mark said: 'I grew up with a Presbyterian mom and a Catholic dad. And never a bad word between them. Especially on the subject of the Bible. I don’t remember ever as a kid not having bibles in our house.' Roma added: 'Faith is deeply important to me, has been since I was a child. I was raised in a family of faith. I’ve always found deep comfort in it, was particularly thrilled in the early ‘90’s to be cast to play an angel on “Touched by an Angel,” which as you know ran for almost 10 years and delivered a central message of God’s love. It was such a privilege to be the messenger on that and my old Irish father used to say 'the family that prays together stays together'.' Dad and his boys: Mark Burnett and his sons James (left) and Cameron (middle) in June, pictured at a Tony Robbins convention . British boys: James and Cameron Burnett in London . Speaking about The Bible, Mark said: 'We’ve approached this as God’s love story, God’s love of all of us. There’s only one perfect character in the entire 66 books. That’s Jesus Christ. Everybody else, to lesser or greater degrees, are flawed, like all of us. 'And people have huge problems, I mean, in kings, but still God didn’t give up. And that’s the message. It’s like an unconditional love story.' In September 2014, movie studio MGM acquired a 55 per cent interest in One Three Media and Lightworkers Media, both run by Mark and Roma. The two companies have been consolidated into a new film and television company, United Artists Media Group. Burnett is UA's CEO and Roma is president of Lightworkers Media.

He was studying IT and wanted to become an engineer. ‘He moved out recently but he had the spare key to my house and came round for dinner all the time. ‘I had no idea what he was planning. He must have been brainwashed. He went out there with three brothers from Brighton. ‘His passport was expired so he went up into my room and got the passport of his 15-year-old brother. It makes me wonder about the Border Control people because they look nothing like each other.’ The Foreign Office said it was aware of the reports of the dead Britons but could not confirm them at this stage. Kamara was a member of Jabhat al-Nusra, an Al Qaeda affiliate which has fought with, and sometimes against, Islamic State.

"Rebuilding his life: Ian McNicholl is to have cosmetic surgery to treat scars left after he was the victim of violence from a former girlfriend . A businessman who was beaten so badly by his 5ft 1ins girlfriend that he almost lost his arm is to have cosmetic surgery to heal his horrific scars. Ian McNicholl, 49, from Hull, suffered two years of abuse at the hands of Michelle Williamson, including one attack where she sprayed bleach in his eyes. He also suffered fractures to his skull, cheekbones, and nose, three cracked ribs and horrific burns on his arm from an iron at the hands of his ex-girlfriend. Williamson, who is now serving a seven-year jail sentence for causing grievous bodily harm, also lit cigarettes and shoved them up her partner’s nose after falsely accusing him of having an affair. On one occasion, she also poured two kettles full of boiling water over him - and even attacked him with a vacuum cleaner. Ian, who is now preparing for the surgery, said: 'It was between Christmas and New Year (in 2006) when she first accused me of having an affair with one of her friends. 'This was the first time she lashed out. She punched me in the face and I had a black eye.' Williamson begged him for forgiveness, saying it was just a one off and a soon moved into his flat in Grimsby. However a few weeks later she launched another attack with the vacuum cleaner. Ian recalled: 'She began ranting and raving about previous partners of mine. 'Then, all of a sudden, she switched the vacuum cleaner off, grabbed the nozzle and whacked me across the face with it. I could feel my cheek split.' This was the first of many outbursts of domestic violence from the then 34-year-old and the attacks got progressively worse. His worst ordeal came when Williamson poured a kettle full of . boiling water into his lap and, while he was screaming in agony, she . reboiled the kettle and poured it over him again. He continued: 'She would show off my injuries to her friends. 'I felt as though I couldn’t walk away, because she told me she had family who were involved in organised crime who would kill me if I left her. I felt I was trading with my life. I was brought up well and taught never to hit a woman - and I didn’t lay a finger on her.' The night before Michelle’s arrest, Ian endured an attack that lasted almost seven hours, where he was beaten with a metal bar and his body smashed in places with a claw hammer. An anonymous phone call tipped off the police, who took Ian to Hull Royal Infirmary and arrested Michelle. Injuries: Ian McNicholl shows a scar on his arm caused by an iron and damage to his shoulder that was caused by a hammer attack . Although the violence had come to an end, Ian didn’t realise the aftermath would be just as bad. He woke up the following day to find himself in a night shelter for the homeless, wearing his bloodstained clothes from the day before. He said: 'Michelle had taken control of my finances and run up lots of debt. I didn’t have any money and didn’t know where to go or what to do. 'I was petrified walking the streets of Hull, as I was paranoid her brothers were going to come and kill me. As it turns out, they didn’t exist, but I didn’t know that at the time.' After a phone call to the Salvation Army, he was given accommodation at William Booth Life House, where he stayed for 18 months, and he received psychological help and support from The Men’s Helpline. No, Ian has dedicated his life to helping the homeless - being appointed vice-chairman of Hull’s Homelessness Focus Group. He added: 'I can completely understand why some men will feel embarrassed speaking out - men generally don’t like talking about their feelings. 'But the bigger issue is that lots of men don’t know where to go for help and there’s a lot of gender bias. 'The massive problem is that men are not seen as victims. We need a gender neutral awareness campaign, or even a male-specific one.' Despite his experience, Ian isn’t put off having a relationship again. 'It’s going to be difficult when I meet someone who doesn’t know what I’ve been through,' said Ian. 'They will no doubt ask about my scars, and I’m not going to lie. My fear is that they will wonder what I did to deserve it.'","Ian McNicholl had bleach sprayed in his eyes and had lit cigarettes placed up his nose .

"Abusive text messages sent to the forewoman of the jury during the Shane Chartres-Abbott murder trial is under investigation by Victorian police. Three men were found not guilty today of murdering self-proclaimed vampire gigolo Shane Chartres-Abbott outside his home in Melbourne's north more than a decade ago. During the trial, while the jury was absent on June 19, Justice Lex Lasry told lawyers the forewoman received  threatening messages from a man she knew who was in prison the ABC reported. The forewoman was then stood down from the trial. Justice Lasry said the man allegedly sending the texts accused the juror of 'wrecking his life' and made reference to Goussis, one of the men standing trial for murder. Scroll down for video . Warren Shea, 42, was one of three men found not guilty of murdering self-proclaimed vampire gigolo Shane Chartres-Abbott in 2003. He walked free from the Victorian Supreme Court on Tuesday morning . Mr Chartres-Abbott, 28, was gunned down outside his Reservoir home while on trial for raping a female client and biting off part of her tongue . Justice Lasry said there was no suggestion that Goussis was behind the messages, but it was possible that the man sending the messages had a connection to him. Justice Lasry described the texts as 'pathetic and cowardly' and appeared to be contempt of court. Mr Chartres-Abbott, 28, was gunned down outside his Reservoir home on June 4, 2003 while on trial for raping a female client and biting off part of her tongue. The woman's former boyfriend Mark Adrian Perry, 46, and two other men, Warren Shea, 42, and Evangelos Goussis, 46, pleaded not guilty to his murder. A career criminal, who cannot be named, claimed he gunned down Mr Chartres-Abbott to even the score for the alleged rape and said the three men were involved in the murder. The criminal said Mr Goussis was with him when he shot Mr Chartres-Abbott with a .357 magnum, the Victorian Supreme Court heard. But this morning the jury returned not guilty verdicts for all three men following their two-month trial. During the trial the jury heard Mr Chartres-Abbott told his alleged victim he was a vampire who needed to drink blood to survive, and he was 'older than the city of Melbourne'. The jury deliberated for four and a half days before returning their verdict. Prosecutor Andrew Tinney SC told the trial Perry was enraged about the attack on his ex-girlfriend and set the hit in motion by contacting his friend. 'The murder was carried out for perhaps the oldest and most powerful reason - vengeance,' he said. Mr Tinney argued that even though Perry, Shea or Goussis weren't the ones to pull the trigger, they were part of a joint criminal enterprise that led to Mr Chartres-Abbott's death. 'Each is as guilty of the murder of Shane Chartres-Abbott as the man who pulled the trigger,' he said. The woman's former boyfriend Mark Adrian Perry, 46, was also cleared of both murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter . A career criminal, who cannot be named, claimed he gunned down Mr Chartres-Abbott and said three men were involved including 42-year-old Warren Shea . The criminal said Evangelos Goussis was with him when he shot Mr Chartres-Abbott with a .357 magnum, the Victorian Supreme Court heard . Barristers for each of Perry, Shea and Goussis said the man who cannot be named was a liar, and their clients had nothing to do with the death. Supporters of the men cheered as the verdicts were delivered and applauded the jury members as they left the court room. Goussis wept and mouthed his thanks to the jury while holding his hand over his heart. He is serving a 30-year prison sentence for the murders of gangland figures Lewis Moran and Lewis Caine, but the verdicts leave Perry and Shea free to walk from court.

"An ISIS deserter has claimed he fled the terrorist organisation because he was appalled at the level of violence and their willingness to kill innocent women and children. Abu Almouthanna, 27, escaped from Syria across the border to Turkey where he is under the constant threat of death. The Syrian national said he had spent three years fighting against the Basher al-Assad regime when he was eventually forced to join ISIS. Scroll down for video . Abu Almouthanna said he joined ISIS after his al-Qaeda-linked group had been defeated by the hardliners . Almouthanna said ISIS regularly executed innocent women and children following a battle, file picture . He said after joining ISIS he was paid $150 a month in wages but was forced to adhere to strict rules, the breaching of which would lead to a death sentence. He told Fox News that he had no problem in killing Christians, Kurds and Yazidis, but he had issues with attacking rival jihadis and their families. Almouthanna was jailed by al-Assad's regime in 2012 for 10 months where he was routinely tortured. Following his release, he joined the Free Syrian Army. Then, he later joined the al-Qaeda-linked Jabhat al Nusra. However, when they were attacked by ISIS, he decided to join the hard-line terror group. He said: 'I was happy to move to ISIS. They had the most money and the best weapons, but other than that they were just the same.' He claimed he was sent to a terrorist training camp run by Chechens and Afghans, where he made contacts with several European fighters. He said three Frenchmen and a Briton were particularly chilling. He said: 'From Day One, they joked about cutting heads and making the enemy pay.' Almouthanna spent 14 months fighting for ISIS between Raqqa and Deir ez Sor, fighting mostly the Free Syrian Army. According to Almouthanna, ISIS spends most its time now fighting fellow jihadis and not the al-Assad regime . He claimed that battles led by the Chechens were the most organised as they were the most tactically aware, whereas Libyans preferred hand-to-hand fighting. Most battles began with a wave of suicide bombings. However, after the battle, ISIS fighters routinely murdered innocent women and children. He said that prisons in Raqqa were filled with 'enemies' of ISIS, but that included fighters who had broken the terror organisation's strict rules. Almouthanna told Fox News that he made his decision to leave following the five-week battle for Markada. He said: 'By the end, we were killing everything and everyone, including women and children in surrounding villages or left in the town.' Almouthanna denied that he was involved in killing innocent civilians although admitted that if ISIS ever found him he would be executed.","Abu Almouthanna joined ISIS as they had better weapons and paid cash .

"The girlfriend of murdered vampire gigolo Shane Chartres-Abbott, has finally broken her silence and spoken out about her lack of trust in the Justice System. In an interview with the Herald Sun, Kathleen Price also relived the horrific moments that her partner, a male prostitute from Victoria who was on trial for the rape and mutilation of a client, was gunned down in front of her and their unborn child outside of their home more than a decade ago. 'I don't have any faith in the legal system full stop,' she told the Herald Sun. 'It seems that although you try and do the right thing and you got to trial for something that you're accused of, apparently somebody can say ""I'm going to play god now, and I don't believe you have the right to a fair trial, but fair play when it comes to me having right to trial, I want the legal system to do everything it can for me"". It's ridiculous. Scroll down for video . Kathleen Price, the girlfriend of murdered vampire gigolo Shane Chartres-Abbott (whose body is pictured being photographed at the crime scene), has finally broken her silence and spoken out about her lack of trust in the Justice System . 'I want to stamp my feet and throw a tantrum and say this is not the way it's supposed to be.' Her outburst comes after Mark Adrian Perry, Warren Shea and Evangelos Goussis were this week acquitted in the Victorian Supreme Court of orchestrating the murder. The decision means that despite a decade-long police investigation, featuring a $1 million reward and an international manhunt, the circumstances surrounding the public execution remain unclear. Ms Price went on to describe the moment Chartres-Abbott was shot outside of their home while the couple and Ms Price's father were on the way to the fifth day of a trial in which Chartres-Abbott was accused of brutally raping and mutilating a client. During the trial in 2003, the court heard that he had boasted he was a vampire older than the city of Melbourne before also biting off part of her tongue. The woman was found unconscious in a Melbourne hotel room, bloodied and beaten, with cuts, burns and bite marks covering her body and a chunk of her tongue missing. A police officer described it as one of the most brutal rapes he had seen. Her outburst comes after three men, including Warren Shea, 42, (pictured) were found not guilty of murdering self-proclaimed vampire gigolo Shane Chartres-Abbott in 2003 . Ms Price described how the day Chartres-Abbott was killed, she ran inside their Reservoir home to make emergency phone calls and grabbed a tea towel while her partner, 28-years-old at the time, lay outside, bleeding from the gunshot wound to his neck. Ten years later, Ms Price said it was difficult for their son to grow up amongst the sensationalist news of his father but that she tries not to sugar coat things. And in his final address to the jury, prosecutor Andrew Tinney SC was at pains to ensure they also saw Mr Chartres-Abbott as a man, not a monster. 'He was no more or less than a man, a normal person in our society,' Mr Tinney said. 'No doubt with his own strengths and weaknesses, his own failings, his own virtues, no doubt with friends and family who loved him. 'He wasn't a vampire gigolo. He was a man. He was a human being. 'He was gunned down in broad daylight at the front of his house, in front of his pregnant girlfriend and her father in a suburban street in our city, not in some seedy or dangerous part of the world, but in Melbourne. 'The people who carried out this crime, whoever they are, were not heroes, they were not doing society a favour,"" he said. 'They were striking a shameful blow, members of the jury, at the very heart of our system.' Shane Chartres-Abbott, a male prostitute from Victoria, was on trial for the rape and mutilation of a client when he was killed. The woman's former boyfriend Mark Adrian Perry, 46, (centre) was also cleared of both murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter . The trial’s star witness, a career criminal who cannot be named, admitted to being the trigger man in the murder, and implicated Mr Perry, Mr Shea and Goussis. Mr Tinney urged the jury to see past his lack of morals to the logical sequence of events the prosecutor presented. It was ultimately the jury's unwillingness to accept the killer as a truthful witness that resulted in the painstaking investigation falling at the last hurdle. The killer said he was clad in a balaclava when he raced at Mr Chartres-Abbott and killed him before fleeing to a waiting car on June 4, 2003. But he claimed he was just the final link in the chain, which began the night Mr Chartres-Abbott allegedly raped his client. Mr Perry, 46, the woman's former boyfriend, was accused of ordering the hit as revenge. The prosecutors claimed he sought out his childhood friend, Mr Shea, 42, as a conduit to the killer. Goussis, 46, was accused of accompanying the killer on the mission and acting as his getaway driver. It was claimed that Mr Perry ordered the hit as revenge after seeking out his childhood friend, Mr Shea as a conduit while Evangelos Goussis, 46, (pictured) was accused of accompanying him and acting as his getaway driver. Evangelos Goussis was also cleared of his charges . The killer claims Shea put the sorry tale of the vampire rape to him over a beer at an inner-Melbourne pub and, appalled, he agreed to carry out the attack on Mr Chartres-Abbott. 'I was told that he made a shocking mess of her, bit hunks out of her ... and left her for dead,' the killer said. Before delivering his lengthy testimony, the killer wavered, threatening to refuse to give evidence. When he finally did, he abused defence barristers and made changes to his story. He also implicated former policemen Peter Lalor and David Waters in the killing, two men not charged. The killer was ultimately attacked by barristers for Mr Perry, Mr Shea and Goussis as a manipulative conman who could not be trusted. They always maintained their clients had nothing to do with Mr Chartres-Abbott's demise. Mr Chartres-Abbott, 28 at the time, was gunned down outside his Reservoir home in front of his pregnant girlfriend and her father . Mr Perry, Mr Shea and Goussis were cleared to cheers from their supporters in court, who also applauded the jurors as they left the room. The men were found not guilty of murder and the alternative charge of manslaughter. The verdicts left Mr Perry and Mr Shea free to walk from court. For Mr Perry, it was his first taste of freedom since July 2013, when police tracked him to a Perth factory where he was working under a false name. He had vanished in 2007 when he learnt he was being investigated for the killing. Mr Shea had enjoyed bail since late 2013 and was pictured smiling broadly on his way out of the court building. For Goussis, it meant avoiding a third conviction for murder. Already serving a 30-year prison sentence for the murders of gangland figures Lewis Moran and Lewis Caine, he wept and mouthed his thanks to the jury while holding his hand over his heart. As for the prosecution, it was left to rue the tarnished reputations of the victim and the star witness.","Kathleen Price has finally spoken out about the murder of her partner Shane Chartres-Abbott in 2003 .

"Human minds could be downloaded into robots within 10 years, allowing human beings to 'live forever', says the Russian entrepreneur who heads a hi-tech research project called 'Avatar'. Itskov, a media entrepreneur, claims to have hired 30 scientists to reach this goal - and is now looking for other scientists to help with the project. 'This project is leading down the road to immortality,' says Itskov. 'A person with a perfect Avatar will be able to remain part of society. People don’t want to die.'

He says his technology will be of interest at first to the 'disabled and close to dying' ‘I understand these are some very big . challenges for scientists,’ Itskov says. ‘But I believe in . something you call ‘The American Dream.’ If you put all your energy and . time into something, you can make it a reality. Itskov envisages surgically 'transplanting' a human consciousness into a robot body within 10 years. He hopes to then 'upload' minds without surgery, leaving human bodies as empty husks as their owners 'live on' inside robots. The project is called Avatar after the James Cameron movie, set far in . the future, where human soldiers use mind control to inhabit the bodies of . human alien hybrids as they carry out a war against the inhabitants of a . distant world. 'The next effort of science will be to create a new body for the human being,' says Itskov, speaking at the Global Future 2045 conference. 'It will have a perfect brain-machine interface to allow control and a human brain life support system so the brain can survive outside the body.' Itskov says that the system will at first be of interest to, 'Disabled people and people at the edge of dying.' 'The third phase will be to create an artificial human brain,' he says - a computer environment into which human minds can be uploaded.

"In a one-time conservative 'red' state whose map now looks pock-marked with 'blue' enclaves, Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and long-time Clinton confidante, won a close governor's election Tuesday that is expected to set the tone for broader political battles in 2014 and 2016. McAuliffe, the fundraising envelope-pusher who cooked up the idea to sell access to the Lincoln Bedroom under President Bill Clinton, is now positioned to navigate Virginia into the Democratic Party's column when Hillary Clinton runs for the top job in 2016. The governor-elect had held solid double-digit polling leads over Ken Cuccinelli, the state's tea party-backed Republican attorney general. But ultimately fewer than 55,000 votes – out of more than 2.2 million cast – separated the two hard-charging men. It was a massive shift from 2009, when McAuliffe crashed and burned in a Democratic primary because he was seen as a carpetbagger with no Virginia ties. Scroll down for video .

Like old times: Former President Bill Clinton campaigned for McAuliffe in Harrisonburg, Va., on Oct. 29, and showed up at other rallies to support the fundraiser who kept him in teh White House for eight years . President Obama stumped with McAuliffe on November 3 in Arlington, Virginia, a close-in suburb of Washington, D.C. McAuliffe (R) is a veteran Democratic Party money man who came up with innovative ways for Bill Clinton to raise campaign cash -- including awarding a night in the White House's Lincoln Bedroom to top donors . A third-party candidate, Libertarian Robert Sarvis, collected more than 146,000 votes on Tuesday, enough to swing the election if his support came, as it likely did, mostly from otherwise Republican-leaning Virginians. His campaign's largest source of funding, the Libertarian Booster PAC, is kept afloat mainly by Texas software tycoon Joe Liemandt, who Federal Election Commission records show 'bundled' between $100,000 and $200,000 in contributions toward President Obama's 2012 re-election. Liemandt was among three dozen such bundlers who scored invitations to the State Dinner on Mar 14, 2012, honoring British Prime Minister David Cameron. Sarvis' Obama connection made some conservative strategists carp on Tuesday night that he was a tool of Democrats eager to split off enough Republicans to deliver McAuliffe a victory. 'We've seen this kind of spoiler effect before. Remember Ralph Nader in 2000?' a GOP adviser told MailOnline during a phone call from the state capitol of Richmond. 'The whole Bush v. Gore thing came down to 537 votes in Florida, and Nader got more than 97,000 votes there. If he doesn't run in 2000, Al Gore is president for at least four years.' Ken Cuccinelli conceded the race along with his wife Teiro and their family after returns showed he would fall less than 2.5 percentage points short . Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli came up short after a bruising campaign that pitted tea party Republicans against the star power of both the Obamas and the Clintons . Thomas Paine re-enactor John Wallmeyer, a member of four different tea party organizations, waited with other Republicans on Tuesday night, only to learn that Cuccinelli would lose by a relative handful of votes . Cuccinelli was . the first state-level attorney general to initiate legal action against . the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act. He sought to . leverage voter dissatisfaction with the failed rollout, tying McAuliffe . to it at every opportunity. McAuliffe countered with a more devastating and costly avalanche of advertising that cast the Republican as an anti-female tea party stooge who would stand in the way of funding the kind of massive transportation projects that D.C. commuters have demanded. Cuccinelli opposed it because it requires a tax increase. Other ads hammered Cuccinelli for supporting 'personhood' legislation through an anti-abortion  movement that has raised the ire, and opened the pocketbook, of Planned Parenthood. 'I think every single person in Virginia is glad that the TV ads are now over,' he quipped during his victory speech.' Both candidates brought star power across the Potomac River to stump with them. Cuccinelli relied on tea party superstars like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. McAuliffe had the Clintons and the Obamas. Ultimately, the president and McAuliffe tied Cuccinelli to other Republicans who have caught most of the blame for October's federal government shutdown. Blue Virginia: McAuliffe (R) cracked a joke at Clinton (C) and won approval from U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, himself a former Virginia governor . Out of tea? Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) stumped for Cuccinelli and read Bible verses at the October Family Foundation of Virginia Gala, but complaints about the Obama administration's 'hostility to religious liberty' weren't enough . Pockets of blue: Cuccinelli won far more Virginia counties than McAuliffe, for the Democrat swept the most populous urban and suburban areas including Richmond and the Northern counties adjacent to Washington, D.C. Spoiler: Robert Sarvis, the libertarian candidate for Virginia Governor, collected more than enough right-leaning votes to split the GOP. His main financier was a top Obama contribution bundler . Dumbfounded: Republican partisans thought Cuccinelli had pulled off the upset of the year, with Obamacare driving down Democrats' poll numbers and the sting of the partial government shutdown in the rear-view mirror . Northern Virginia's populous exurb . counties, blue Democratic oases in a sea of red, are packed with federal . government workers who bore the . brunt of temporary furloughs and other job insecurities in what is . otherwise the most recession-proof industry in the U.S. Cuccinelli committed several unforced political errors, including a 2012 interview in which he was thought to compare illegal immigrants to the rats that plague sections of Washington, D.C. A protester calling for comprehensive immigration reform was removed from the stage before Ken Cuccinelli gave his concession speech Tuesday night. The defeated GOP candidate had a huge voter deficit among Latinos . Talking during a radio interview about a pest-control law in the city that prevents the mass killing of rats, he said, 'It is worse than our immigration policy. You can't break up rat families ... and you can't even kill 'em.' Republican Party spokesman Garren Shipley later told The Washington Post that Cuccinelli 'was talking about how disturbing it was that our laws treat rats better than people, because our laws let us break up immigrant families.' But Latino voters turned out in droves to support McAuliffe on Tuesday, with many convinced that his Republican opponent was anti-immigrant and anti-Hispanic. Both men had financial scandals to dodge. McAuliffe was tied to an electric car company, GreenTech, that ran afoul of federal investigators. Worse for his Virginia image, the company had set up its production line in Mississippi. And Cuccinelli was haplessly tied to the financial scandals the engulfed the current Republican governor, Bob McDonnell. A McDonnell funder who bought access with gifts to him and his wife – including at least one Rolex watch – also gave Cuccinelli and his family the run of his lake home for complimentary vacations. McAuliffe, like all Virginia governors, will be a short-term winner: The state limits its top political executives to a single term in office.","Clinton's White House money man, Terry McAuliffe dreamed up a way to tap donors for more cash by offering them nights in the Lincoln Bedroom .
His rise to the governor's mansion in Richmond will cement the Clintons' chances to turn Virginia 'blue' if – or when – Hillary runs in 2016 .
The Obamas and Clintons stumped for McAuliffe, helping him overwhelm state AG Ken Cuccinelli's reliance on Sen. Ted Cruz and other tea partiers .
McAuliffe's campaign vastly outspent the GOP on broadcast ads, including many that cast Cuccinelli as anti-woman and anti-Hispanic .
A third-party Libertarian candidate who ultimately split the GOP was funded by a top Obama campaign bundler, raising Republicans' cries of dirty pool ."

"Look around the cabin during the safety demonstration on any flight, and you are sure to see the majority of passengers reading their magazines, looking at their phones, even carrying on their conversations. Flying has become so commonplace that many completely ignore the essential safety information being explained. But in the event of an emergency - would you actually remember what to do? British Airways are offering a Flight Safety Awareness Course to increase knowledge and awareness of safety procedures and give them the opportunity to experience a simulated aircraft evacuation from a smoke-filled Boeing 737 cabin simulator. Emergency slide: British Airways offer passengers the opportunity to experience emergency evacuations in their Flight Safety Awareness Course . Training: The course takes place on a Boeing 737 simulator at the Cranebank training centre near Heathrow . Participants in the half day course learn to open real aircraft doors and over-wing exits, fit life jackets, jump down emergency evacuation slides and go through a smoke chamber. The team of six safety instructors are all former cabin crew or flight engineers. Far from a dull lecture, the class are seated in a full motion Boeing 737 simulator, experience the usual safety demonstration, taxi and takeoff as usual before the cabin fills with smoke and the passengers are 'evacuated'. Brace! The class experience a simulated emergency landing and evacuation . Afterwards, the class is given a full debrief with advice on techniques and procedure, as well as tips for travelling safely both on board and in hotels. Participants are told what to do in the event of ditching over water, and loss of cabin pressure. 'Customers will learn what they should and should not do in just about any emergency situation that could happen on an aircraft, any airline’s aircraft,' Flight Safety Awareness Course leader, Andy Clubb tells MailOnline. 'They get the opportunity to ask any questions that they have ever had about flying and flight safety to British Airways’ experienced training team. 'The most important thing they will learn is just how staggeringly safe flying is and how much is invested in crew training.' Remain calm: The cabin fills with smoke in the simulated emergency, to give participants an idea ofthe real-life experience . Since its inception in 2003, more than 15,000 people have taken the course. While most participants are employees of corporate companies, individuals are able to participate in classes with spare places available. The recent air disasters have not resulted in an increase in bookings for the course so far, Clubb says. 'Most courses are booked by people who have heard about the course from previous delegates who have recommended it to colleagues and friends,' he says. 'It ultimately demonstrates just how safe flying is.' Not so fun in real life: Passengers try out using the emergency evacuation slide . 'It ultimately demonstrates just how safe flying is': Crew show the class how to operate the doors in the event of an emergency . The Flight Safety Awareness Course was originally designed for the petrochemical industry who fly their staff to wherever oil and gas is located in the world. 'This can be in some very remote and unusual places that are not always served by national airlines,' says Clubb. 'They request the course as part of their Corporate and Social Responsibility towards their staff.' The courses take place at BA's Cranebank training centre near Heathrow. Valuable experience: The half-day course, originally developed for petrochemical company employees, costs from £135 .

"No footballer wants to be out injured but how strange it can be when your stock rises during an enforced absence, as if you become a better player, at least among those who don’t know what they’ve got until it has gone. Michael Carrick sat on the bench at The Hawthorns, watching Manchester United chasing around in the chaos of a thrilling 2-2 draw, unable to strike the balance between adventure and caution. Louis van Gaal insists he will never curb his desire to entertain but his team requires a keystone, a steadying influence to conduct its fabulous attackers, while offering a little help to those responsible for protecting the goal behind David de Gea. Michael Carrick returned to the Manchester United squad for the draw with West Brom on Monday . Thoughts turned to Carrick, even though he remained among the substitutes. He might be the one. Van Gaal needed to find goals against West Bromwich Albion, having trailed for much of the game, but in the long-term he needs control. In the Sky Sports studio, Gary Neville implored the manager to bring back the 33-year-old midfielder, who has been out since ankle surgery in the summer, in time to face Chelsea on Sunday and Manchester City, a week later. In May, Carrick was omitted from England’s World Cup squad after a campaign when he could be found toiling away at the heart of United’s disarray as they slipped out of the Champions League and David Moyes lost his job. Carrick has been a key player for United over the past few seasons and won his England place back . Roy Hodgson – advised by coaching assistants Ray Lewington and Neville – decided there was no place for Carrick in Brazil, preferring Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard as his experienced central midfielders. Carrick, despite a general consensus that he has got better with age, has not won an England cap since starting in the final World Cup qualifier against Poland, a 2-0 win at Wembley just over a year ago. However, Lampard and Gerrard have retired from international football and Hodgson has reshaped his team to deploy a midfielder diamond, which has offered encouragement as it accommodates two strikers and a creator like Raheem Sterling. Carrick thrives in his role as a holding midfielder for United . What he is missing is a natural holding midfielder. Not necessarily a ball-winner but a deep play-maker who can pass long or short with both feet and dictate the tempo; someone with positional sense and the ability to read the rhythms of a game, preferably with physical presence and a little defensive instinct. Jack Wilshere has coped well, but it is a role perfect for Carrick. After a 13-year international career of 31 caps, one retirement and one come-back, England are playing with a system suited to his strengths, while Gerrard and Lampard have quit. Carrick could work perfectly in Roy Hodgson's new system . Whether Hodgson will - or even should -return to Carrick is debateable. England are building a team for the future. His return would only deny Wilshere more experience in a role he is learning but if Hodgson is unsure about Wilshere the anchorman – as Arsene Wenger is – then he can recall the Manchester United midfielder as he develops an alternative. At United, there is no debate. Van Gaal will restore Carrick to the starting line-up, as soon as his fitness levels allow, either to anchor the midfield on his own in a diamond, releasing Daley Blind to fulfil other duties, perhaps at left-back, or alongside Blind in a 4-2-3-1 formation for these two tough fixtures against Chelsea and City.","Manchester United drew 2-2 with West Bromwich Albion on Monday night .

"A man agreed to gun down a self-proclaimed vampire gigolo as a favour and to even the score for an alleged rape, a Melbourne court was told on Wednesday. Male escort Shane Chartres-Abbott, 28, was gunned down near his Reservoir home in June 2003 as he faced trial for allegedly raping a former client and biting off part of her tongue. The woman's former boyfriend Mark Adrian Perry, 46, and two other men, Warren Shea, 42, and Evangelos Goussis, 46, have pleaded not guilty to his murder. The scene of the crime: Investigators attend the scene of Shane Chartres-Abbott's death, near his home in Ringwood, Melbourne . Accused: Evangelos Goussis (left) and Mark Adrian Perry (right), both 46, are accused of ordering the execution-style murder of 'vampire' gigolo Shane Chartres-Abbott . A fourth man, who cannot be named, says Shea came to him and told him of the alleged rape in 2003. 'It was in relation to evening the score,' the man told the Victorian Supreme Court. 'He weren't too happy about it. The Warren that I knew was a man of honour and it went against his grain. I shot Chartres-Abbott as a result of that conversation.' When asked by crown prosecutor Andrew Tinney SC why he had killed Mr Chartres-Abbott, the man replied: ""For a favour"". Caught after being on the run: Mark Adrian Perry, centre, being transported from Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport in 2013 - after being extradited from Perth following his arrest for the murder of 'vampire' gigolo Shane Chartres-Abbott . Then and now: Mark Adrian Perry arrives at the Supreme Court in Melbourne, looking far less disheveled than he did when he was extradited from Perth in 2013 . Mr Chartres-Abbott, who told the woman that he needed to drink blood to survive and was 'older than the city of Melbourne', was shot by one man as another attacked his pregnant girlfriend and her father. The alleged rape victim was a former client of the 'vampire' gigolo. She was found naked, beaten up and unconscious in a Prahran hotel room, with bite marks covering her body part of her tongue bitten off. When asked on Wednesday why he killed Mr Chartres-Abbott, the fourth man told the Victorian Supreme Court that it was, 'for a favour' after being given the address by a police officer he knew as 'Stash'. Everything went downhill from here: The Prahran motel where Shane Chartres-Abbott allegedly raped his former client - the impetus for his eventual murder . The man said he was given Mr Chartres-Abbott's address by a police officer he knew as 'Stash'. He said Detective Peter Lalor served a warrant on him for a traffic offence so he had an alibi on the day of the shooting. The man said he gave the officer $1500 and said: 'Thanks very much. Have a drink.' The trial has previously heard Mr Chartres-Abbott told his alleged victim he was a vampire who needed to drink blood to survive, and he was 'older than the city of Melbourne'. The trial, before Justice Lex Lasry, continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Shane Chartres-Abbott was killed near his home as a payback in 2003 .

"It wasn't the gung-ho attacking display watching Manchester United fans will have been hoping for, but Luke Shaw's mature performance for England's Under 21 side on Tuesday night showed signs of promise. Not least because he was able to get another 90 minutes of competitive football under his belt in only his fourth appearance of the season. Two for United and two for Gareth Southgate's side. Shaw helped England's young Lions emerge victorious against Croatia on both occasions, with back-to-back 2-1 wins earning them a place at next year's European Championships. England Under 21 defender Luke Shaw (left) challenges for the ball with Croatia's Drazen Bagaric (right) But for Shaw it was more important than just securing tournament next summer. He needed playing time as he fights for full fitness and a regular place in Louis van Gaal's starting XI. He did his chances of nailing down a spot at Old Trafford no harm in Vincovki, dealing with his defensive duties with ease while trying to show off the natural attacking side of his game. After 15 minutes he used his considerable pace to drive into space down England's left side when the ball made its way into central midfield. He got hold of it inside Croatia's defensive third moments later and immediately looked up in the hope of delivering a quality cross. His execution was poor but his intentions were always positive. Always in an advanced position when England were on the ball, Shaw already looks well-suited to a left wing back role should Van Gaal opt to bring back the preferred 3-5-2 formation he used at the start of the campaign. Shaw puts Barcelona midfielder Alen Halilovic under pressure in Vinkovci on Tuesday evening . Surprisingly Shaw didn't see much of the ball in opening period, with much of England's attacking play coming down the right and Croatia choosing to try and open up their opponents through the middle. But after 36 minutes he burst into life after Ben Gibson's headed clearance fell to him on the edge of England's box. First he showed a clever touch to lift the ball over an onrushing Croatian player's head, before sprinting into the opposition's half, cutting back and finding a team-mate. The move ended with a Nathan Redmond shot being well saved. Although he was the victim of a nutmeg early in the second period, Shaw looked calm when faced with Croatian attackers wanting to do his side harm. He dealt with lively substitute and goalscorer Marko Livaja shortly after his embarrassing moment, clearing the ball for a throw-in in one of few tests of his defensive qualities. He was back at the other end shortly afterwards, cutting inside and finding himself in the middle of Croatia's penalty area. His short pass found Berahino, whose low shot was easily blocked. Shaw (back row, second from left) poses with his England team-mates before kick-off in Croatia . Another show of pace and neat backheel to Hughes followed, before a clever ball down the side of Croatia's defence allowed Harry Kane to drive into the box and win a late corner. Whether it was Croatia looking deflated after Will Hughes' winning goal, or simply a belief in his own ability, Shaw looked increasingly confident as the game went on, bringing the ball out of defence, stopping to take a look around and laying it off and dropping back into position. Like most players on the pitch he looked tired towards the end, but that's to be expected given the injury lay-off which has limited his action so far this season. A few more games like this and he'll be up to speed for both club and country.","England Under 21s beat Croatia 2-1 to reach the European Championships .

"Ruud Gullit has launched a damning critique of Louis van Gaal’s transfer strategy at Manchester United, claiming that his compatriot has badly mis-judged the nature of Premier League football by signing mainly attacking players. Former Chelsea manager and European Footballer of the Year Gullit has previously been a supporter of van Gaal, notbaly duirng the World Cup when he backed the manager’s tactics for the Holland national team when van Gaal was under attack from the likes of Johan Cruyff. But Gullit is perplexed by the signings of Van Gaal at Manchester United, with the likes of Angel Di Mario, Radamel Falcao, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo coming in for £170million even though United have neglected to sign central defenders. Louis van Gaal has had a rough start at Manchester United and is suffering a defensive crisis . Ruud Gullit says Van Gaal made big errors in the transfer window and doesn't understand English football . And the former AC Milan player thinks that van Gaal has put too much faith in the attacking insticts of Dutch football, failing to understand the Premier League. Gullit said: ‘How on earth is it possible that such an experienced and successful manager thought he could start the season at Man United without buying a couple of really strong central defenders? ‘I am still amazed by his buying and his transfers. If you only strengthen the midfield and the attack, than you are underestimating the level and the power of the Premier League. If you want to survive in the top flight of English football you start with the foundation and you build the roof of your house last. Van Gaal has done it the other way round. ‘After the departure of Nemanja Vidic to Inter, and Rio Ferdinand to QPR it was obvious that new central defenders were needed. And he had 200 million in his chequebook to spend. If you don’t use part of that to buy strong, experienced central defenders you have the wrong idea about the Premier League. Van Gaal has managed the likes of Barcelona and Bayern Munich but this may be his toughest task . Gullit says he wants his countryman to be successful but it will take at least three months to sort things . ‘Now matters are even worse because of all the injuries in his defence. He is having to fill one gap after another. And if you have so many injuries and you have not bought the defenders, than you are doing something wrong at your club.’ And Gullit, writing in his Dutch newspaper column in De Telegraaf, claimed that by the time Van Gaal has realised his mistake and fixed the team, it will be too late. ‘I do want him to be succesful at Man United, but by the time he has repaired his team at the back, it will another three months down the road. Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic both left United in the summer and have not been replaced . ‘I feel that his transfer policy at United and his choice to buy only midfielders and attackers is down to his Dutch background. In Holland he grew up only thinking about attacking football. ‘Van Gaal is learning lessons right now. He sees that his defenders are having to deal with the strongest strikers in the world. They bash into his young defenders. In England there are different laws in football. Just look at Gerard Pique. At Barcelona he has become one of the best defenders in the world. At Man United he could not get a look in.’ Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao joined up with the Reds despite defence being a bigger issue .","Ruud Gullit has critiqued his countryman's start at Manchester United .

"Divers have uncovered a preserved 'ghost ship' in 2,000 feet of water nearly 20 miles off the coast of Oahu in Hawaii. Sitting upright, its solitary mast still standing and the ship's wheel still in place, the hulk of the former cable ship Dickenson, later the USS Kailua, was found on the seabed. Experts were stunned to find the ship was surprisingly intact for a vessel that was sunk with a torpedo. Scroll down for video . Sitting upright, its solitary mast still standing and the ship's wheel still in place, the hulk of the former cable ship Dickenson, later the USS Kailua, was found on the seabed in 2,000 feet of water nearly 20 miles off the coast of Oahu in Hawaii. Researchers from the University of Hawai'i (UH) and NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries today revealed the ship was found by a robotic submersible. 'It is always a thrill when you are closing in on a large sonar target with the Pisces submersible and you don't know what big piece of history is going to come looming out of the dark,' said Terry Kerby, the submersible pilot. 'One of our first views of the USS Kailua was the classic helms wheel on the fantail. 'The ship was surprisingly intact for a vessel that was sunk with a torpedo. 'The upper deck structures from the bow to the stern were well-preserved and showed no sign of torpedo damage.' 'From her interisland service to her role in Pacific communications and then World War II, Dickenson today is like a museum exhibit resting in the darkness, reminding us of these specific elements of Pacific history,' said Van Tilburg. 'Seeing the ship come into view, we were all amazed at its level of preservation - and by the fact that everything was more or less in place. Launched in Chester, Pennsylvania in early 1923 for the Commercial Pacific Cable Company, Dickenson was a vital part of a global network of submarine cable that carried telecommunications around the world. When the cable reached Hawai'i for the first time in 1901, it was a major step in establishing not only a key link in the network, but also in connecting the islands to the rest of the world with near-instant communication. Dickenson arrived in Hawai'i and started work in July of that year. Repairing cable and carrying supplies, Dickenson served the remote stations at Midway and Fanning Island from 1923 until 1941. The famous battle of Midway, off the atoll's shores in 1942 saw it take on a new role as a warship. Dickenson, now chartered by the U.S. Navy, entered service as USS Kailua (IX-71) to service cable and submarine nets in the South Pacific until it returned to Pearl Harbor at the end of the war. No longer needed by the Navy or the Commercial Cable Company, the former USS Kailua was sunk as a target by submarine torpedo fire on February 7, 1946. The exact location was not recorded, and the final resting place of the ship had remained a mystery. 'The identification of the wreck was easy, not only because of its unique form, but also because the Navy's identification number of IX-71 was still painted on the bow,' said Delgado, director of the Maritime Heritage Program. Detailed analysis of sonar surveys of the sea floor off Oahu by Steve Price and Terry Kerby of HURL has found a number of significant, previously uncharted wrecks that remained unidentified until encountered by HURL's Pisces submersibles. These have included the Japanese midget submarine sunk in the opening hour of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the massive aircraft carrier submarines I-400 and I-401. The ships copntrol system was found nearby. The USS Kailua wreck is now considered an historic site. The USS Kailua wreck is considered an historic site. 'We plan to nominate the wreck to the National Register of Historic Places,' noted Delgado. 'This unique American ship, vital in its role in keeping global telecommunications open in the first part of the 20th century, is also linked to historically significant Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, now part of Papahanaumokukea Marine National Monument in the National Marine Sanctuary System. Wrecks such as this remind us of special places in the ocean, like the monument, that connect all of us to them as refuges, sanctuaries and museums beneath the sea.' There are no plans for a return to the site or any recovery; the wreck owned by the U.S. Government and is protected as Federal Property.","Launched in Chester, Pennsylvania in early 1923,  Dickenson was a vital part of a global network of submarine cable that carried messages .

"A 16-month-old boy died after swallowing iron tablets he thought were his 'mummy’s sweets', an inquest heard. Corbin Littlewood, of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, took a fatal dose after being given the pills by his toddler sister, who had climbed onto a bathroom sink to reach them from a shelf. When Corbin was taken to hospital after he swallowed the tablets on March 21 doctors also found he was suffering from swine flu. Loss: Corbin Littlewood died after swallowing iron tablets he thought were sweets . The toddler was taken to Calderdale Royal Hospital after Miss Hockham found Corbin vomiting and called an ambulance . He died from a combination of the overdose and swine flu three days later. The inquest in Huddersfield on Wednesday heard how Corbin’s mother, Claire Hockham, had stored the tablets - which she had been given just days earlier to treat her anaemia - on a bathroom shelf out of reach of her three children. But Corbin’s older sister climbed onto the bathroom sink and opened the child-proof bottle before giving him what she called 'mummy's sweets'. They then each took several pills. Doctors discovered that Corbin had extremely dangerous levels of iron in his blood, an overdose of which often causes fatal damage to vital organs . The youngsters were taken to Calderdale Royal Hospital after Miss Hockham found Corbin vomiting and called an ambulance. Doctors discovered that Corbin had extremely dangerous levels of iron in his blood, an overdose of which often causes fatal damage to vital organs, the inquest heard. He was also found to be suffering from the deadly H1N1 variant of influenza known as swine flu and was transferred to the intensive paediatric care unit at Leeds General Infirmary, where he was given anti-viral drug Tamiflu. He was put on drugs which increase the heart’s muscular power to stabilise his soaring blood pressure and help his breathing. But doctors told Miss Hockham and the boy's father Gary Littlewood, who were expecting their fourth child, to prepare for the worst and Corbin died on March 24. Corbin’s sister did not have enough of the iron in her system to cause damage and made a full recovery. The inquest concluded that Corbin had died from bronchopneumonia and lung damage caused by iron poisoning and H1N1 flu. Detective Sergeant Stephen Barnes, of . West Yorkshire Police, told the coroner that the iron tablets could . easily be mistaken for sweets, especially by children. After the swine flu was discoverered Corbin was was transferred to the intensive paediatric care unit at Leeds General Infirmary . He . said: 'Medication for children is normally in syrup form, so although . they wouldn’t understand what a tablet could do they have plenty of . experience of sweets. 'Iron tablets in particular look exactly like sweets.' Coroner Mary Burke said it was impossible to tell whether Corbin had died from the overdose, swine flu or both. Iron tablets are dietary supplements containing iron and are primarily used to treat anaemia or other iron deficiencies. Anaemia is a decrease in the number of red blood cells or less than the normal quantity of haemoglobin in the blood. A 2012 study found taking supplements for 12 weeks reduced fatigue by almost a half in women who had low iron levels. American doctors say iron overdose has been one of the leading causes of death caused by toxicological agents in children younger than six because they look like sweets. Side effects can include diarrhea or constipation and abdominal discomfort. Recording a narrative verdict, she said: 'The daughter was not of an age to comprehend what her actions could have resulted in. Corbin himself was too young to understand what these tablets were. 'Both regarded their mother’s medication as sweets... and tragically it resulted in Corbin’s untimely death. 'This is a tragic, tragic set of circumstances. I am fully satisfied that Corbin’s parents acted responsibly with regards to Ms Hockham’s medication and took all reasonable measures to ensure the safe placing of it.' She added: 'The combination of the iron poisoning and the swine flu resulted in Corbin’s death. 'He consumed a large number of tablets, tests revealed he had very high iron levels. He had also contracted swine flu. 'I wish his parents the very deepest condolences. The loss of such a young child is undoubtedly very tragic indeed.' Corbin’s parents did not attend the inquest, but Miss Hockham, 24, said afterwards: 'He was the happiest, bubbliest and cheekiest little boy. 'To lose a child is unimaginable.'","Corbin Littlewood, 16 months, was given the pills by his sister, also a toddler .

"A space telescope so huge it could spot sign of alien life has been given the go ahead. The European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) will have a primary mirror 39 meters (43 yards) in diameter, allowing it to gather around 15 times more light than the largest optical telescopes now functioning. The tip of a mountain high in the Chilean desert was removed in June so site clearance could get under way, with the telescope slated to reach 'first light' in 2024. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of the European Extremely Large Telescope on Cerro Armazones, a 3,060-metre mountaintop in Chile's Atacama Desert: For comparison, look at the size of the cars . 'The decision taken by Council means that the telescope can now be built, and that major industrial construction work for the E-ELT is now funded and can proceed according to plan,' said Tim de Zeeuw, ESO's Director General. 'There is already a lot of progress in Chile on the summit of Armazones and the next few years will be very exciting.' The telescope will have a dome that covers an area the size of a stadium. It has a sensitivity to visible and infrared light tens of times greater than any previous telescope, and is designed to help astronomers peer back to the first galaxies 14 billion years ago. This could unlock secrets of dark matter and dark energy – little-understood forces in space – to help explain how the universe evolved, according to the plans. However, the telescope that will be the world's largest when completed could face a delay to start-up as its European backers wait for Brazil to commit to the funding needed for it to be fully operational. But that could now be delayed until 2026, said its operators the European Southern Observatory (ESO) on Thursday. Full funding of construction is dependent on Brazil becoming the first non-European country to join the ESO, but that has not yet happened. The telescope will have a dome that covers an area the size of a stadium.It has a sensitivity to visible and infrared light tens of times greater than any previous telescope, and is designed to help astronomers peer back to the first galaxies 14 billion years ago. The process is under way but still needs to gain congressional approval in Brazil, where support for it has been patchy. 'It became clear by mid-2014 that the ongoing day-to-day delay was posing an increasing risk to the project and to the scientific aspirations of the ESO community,' said the ESO in a report of a meeting its council held this week. The organization has responded by dividing the construction into two phases. It gave the green-light this week to the first phase, which implies spending of around 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) and does not require Brazil's participation. That will mean it can begin building, with contracts for the dome, main structure and some instruments due to be awarded next year. The E-ELT will be a 39-metre aperture optical and infrared telescope sited on Cerro Armazones in the Chilean Atacama Desert (pictured), 20 kilometres from ESO's Very Large Telescope on Cerro Paranal. It will be the world's largest 'eye on the sky' However, unless additional funds can be identified, the two-step phase means completion could be delayed to 2026, it said. Should Brazil finish its ratification - and start paying its 130 million-euro accession fee - by early 2017, then the ESO said it should be able to stick to its original plan. The telescope is one of three vying to be the world's biggest. Also in contention are the Giant Magellan Telescope and the Thirty Meter Telescope. Astronomers hope to use these super-telescopes to look at the first stars and galaxies that formed after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. They also plan to uncover life-threatening asteroids heading towards the planet and spot Earth-like and potentially habitable worlds in orbit around other stars. The race will see sophisticated observatories built on top of mountains in Hawaii and Chile in an attempt to see the wonders hiding in the outer reaches of the cosmos . Astronomers around the world are going head to head to develop three major telescopes that will be at least 10 times more powerful than anything in operation today. Giant Magellan TelescopeLocation: Campanas Peak in Chile Cost: $700 million (£420 million)Status: To be completed within 10 yearsFunding:  U.S, Korea and Australia . The Thirty Meter TelescopeLocation: Mauna Kea's peak in HawaiiCost: €1bn (£900m)Status: To be completed around 2022Funding: Caltech, University of California (UC) and the Association of Canadian Universities for Research in Astronomy (ACURA) The European Extremely Large TelescopeLocation: Atacama Desert, ChileCost: €1bn (£900m)Status: Start of operation is planned for early 2020sFunding: European Southern Observatory . And being the first to complete their projects is crucial. The telescopes are expected to open windows into scientific mysteries that have stumped scientists for centuries. The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), for instance, is currently under construction atop Las Campanas Peak in Chile at an altitude of 8,366 ft (2,550 metres) above sea level. The GMT is a $700 million (£420 million) project being funded by the U.S, Korea and Australia and expected to be operation in around 10 years. It will be made up of seven 27.6 ft (8.4 metre) diameter segments, and is expected to have over 5-10 times the light-gathering ability of existing instruments. The design for E-ELT followed plans for something known as the Overwhelmingly Large Telescope (Owl) which was hoped to have an aperture of 100 metres, the same distance that Usain Bolt ran in 9.58 seconds. An artist's impression of the European and Extremely Large Telescope shows the Milky Way gleaming behind the telescope . However, Owl had to be scrapped because of its overwhelmingly expensive budget, but Eso said it may still be built sometime in the future. The final contender is the €1bn (£900m) Thirty Meter Telescope which had plans for its 2022 operation approved last year. It is being constructed on Mauna Kea's peak in Hawaii which already hosts about a dozen telescopes. The $1bn (£900m) Thirty Meter Telescope had plans for its 2022 operation approved last year . The dormant volcano is popular with astronomers because its summit is well above the clouds at 13,796 feet, offering a clear view of the sky above for 300 days a year. The telescope's segmented primary mirror, which is nearly 100 feet (30 metres) long, will give it nine times the collecting area of the largest optical telescopes in use today. Its images will also be three times sharper. It should help scientists see some 13 billion light years away for a glimpse into the early years of the universe. All three telescopes' websites leave the exact projected date of their completion unknown, expressing the stating will be completed and conducting actual science by 2022.","The European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) will have a primary mirror 39 meters (43 yards) in diameter .

"Jeremy Clarkson has breached Ofcom's broadcasting rules over a 'racial' term made on Top Gear Burma special, the TV watchdog ruled today. The regulator decided the comment, made by the controversial star and aired in March, was offensive. The ruling comes just three months after Clarkson was caught up in another racism row which prompted him to apologise and he was given a final warning about his behaviour by the BBC. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson pictured with Richard Hammond (left) during the Burma special of Top Gear when he made the comment: 'That is a proud moment - but there is a slope on it' as an Asian man crosses . It comes just months after Clarkson was caught up in another racism row and was given final warning by BBC . In that incident unaired footage from the programme came to light in which he appeared to use the n-word. Today's ruling by Ofcom involved a scene in which the presenters were involved in the construction of a makeshift bridge over the River Kwai. Viewers saw an Asian man walking on the bamboo crossing, while Clarkson declared: 'That is a proud moment - but there is a slope on it.' Two viewers were concerned that the word 'slope' was an offensive racist term. An Ofcom spokesman said: 'After a . thorough investigation, Ofcom has found the BBC breached broadcasting . rules by including an offensive racial term in Top Gear, which was not . justified by context. 'Jeremy Clarkson used the word ""slope"" to refer both to an Asian man crossing a bridge, and the incline of the bridge. Clarkson (centre) pictured with Top Gear co-stars Richard Hammond (left) and James May (right) during filming for the Burma special aired in March . Broadcast regulator Ofcom received two complaints about the 'slope' comment made by Clarkson (left) 'This was scripted in advance. 'The BBC failed to take the opportunity, either during filming or post-production, to check whether the word had the potential to offend viewers.' The programme's executive producer, Andy Wilman, had previously apologised for the use of the term, saying it had been intended as a 'light-hearted word-play joke' and that the team had been unaware the term was considered offensive. The BBC has said today: 'We dealt with this matter some time ago, the programme apologised at the time and explained the context, and we are now focusing on delivering another series of one of Britain's best-loved shows.' The motoring programme has faced a number of controversies over the years and prompted complaints from Indian and Mexican politicians over remarks made about their countries while filming on location. In its response to Ofcom, the BBC said that, although programme-makers 'knew that the word could be used to refer to people of Asian origin, they believed that such use was mere slang'. In its judgment, Ofcom said 'there was clearly an opportunity both during filming and post-production to research the word and reach a more considered view on whether it was ""mere slang"" and had the potential to cause offence to viewers'. The regulator decided there was 'insufficient context to justify the broadcast of this material' and that the BBC did not apply generally accepted standards to protect viewers from offensive material.","Regulator decided the comment, which was aired in March was racist .

"Austrian police have arrested 13 people suspected of recruiting fighters for radical Islamic groups in the Middle East after storming a string of mosques, prayer meetings and homes across the country. The state prosecutor's office says they were arrested early on Friday in a series of sweeps of Vienna, the southern city of Graz and Upper Austria province. It says the arrests follow two years of observation of the suspects that included listening in on their telephone calls. Raids: The state prosecutor's office says they were arrested early on Friday in a sweep covering homes and mosques in Vienna (pictured), the southern city of Graz and Upper Austria province. A statement says searches yielded 'terroristic propaganda material,' an unspecified amount of cash and stored computer data. The suspects were not identified, in line with Austrian privacy laws, but media reports said a Vienna-based Bosnian preacher, who was the main suspect, was among those arrested in the raids which began at 4am. About 500 police officers participated in the searches and arrests and found 'terrorist propaganda' as well as cash and files. On top of recruiting fighters, the Kronen Zeitung newspaper reported that the arrested men were investigated for helping to finance the Islamic State group. Recruiting and funding? On top of recruiting fighters, the Kronen Zeitung newspaper reported that the arrested men were investigated for helping to finance the Islamic State group (pictured are four members of IS in Aleppo, Syria). The Interior Ministry says that about 150 people have joined radical Middle East groups from Austria. According to Austria's English-language news service The Local, Vienna is considered by counter-terrorism experts to be 'a hub of global jihad'. In August, nine Chechens who were planning to wage jihad with Isis in Syria were arrested by Austrian police, and are awaiting trial. In June, Austria's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism warned over the threats faced by the country. It said: 'Religiously motivated extremism and terrorism – above all of Islamic character – as well as Salafi-jihadi groups continue to present a great potential threat…The number of young radicalized followers of violent Salafism continues to rise.' 'In this context, the conflict in Syria is of urgent relevance for Austria, since systematic efforts are being made within [Austria] to radicalize and recruit people for the war in Syria…The conflict in Syria has become very popular among violent extremist Salafis.' 'The spectrum of recruits to the conflict in Syria is broadly ethnically diverse. The motivation, however, seems to be uniformly jihadi.'","Some 500 officers raided homes and mosques after two-year investigation .

"The Queen plans to scale back her public duties and give Prince Charles a bigger role as ‘co-head’ of the royal family, well-placed sources have revealed. Buckingham Palace and  senior figures in Whitehall  began discussing how to deal with the monarch’s advancing years several months ago, the Mail understands. They concluded that her 64-year-old son – the longest-serving heir apparent in British history – should take a more prominent position representing the sovereign at key events, particularly those abroad. Scroll down for video . Handing over the reigns: The Queen is reportedly planning to scale back her public . duties and give Prince Charles a bigger role as ‘co-head’ of the royal . family . Royal aides denied that Her Majesty¿s recent ill-health is behind the decision to increase the Prince's role . In a sign of things to come, for the first time in 17 years the Queen will be accompanied by her eldest son at the State Opening of Parliament, which takes place today. The Duchess of Cornwall will also join them. It follows the surprise announcement by Buckingham Palace yesterday that, in a 40-year first, the Queen will not attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference. Instead, Charles will take her place at the two-day event in Sri Lanka in November. Aides reluctantly admitted what has been suspected for some time: that the monarch, who reached the age of 87 last month, was not up to making frequent long-haul trips. But Charles’ presence at Parliament today suggests it is also part of the carefully-choreographed plan to share the burden of responsibility. One senior royal source told the Mail the decision for the Queen not to go to Sri Lanka was part of a ‘wide-scale review’ of her travel plans, although they insisted that it was largely ‘business as usual’. Aides were also swift to deny that Her Majesty’s recent ill-health – she was hospitalised in March for the first time in ten years after being hit by gastroenteritis – had anything to do with the development. But the fact is that the elderly . monarch, who still conducts more than 300 engagements each year, has . been gradually scaling back her diary at home too and her illness was a . clear sign that her legendary stamina can no longer be taken for . granted. The Queen now spends only about three . days a week in London or away on official visits, and prefers to read . her official papers over a long weekend at Windsor Castle. In addition, she is understood to be . concerned not to put too much strain on her husband, Prince Philip, who . will be 92 next month and still accompanies her on most trips. It is not long since he received hospital treatment for a heart condition and a recurring bladder infection. The Mail has also learnt that there . has even been tentative discussion of a change in the law which would be . required to allow Prince Charles to become regent. Historically, regents have only been . created when the monarch is seriously incapacitated – for instance, when . George III was mentally unwell. Prince Charles, seen here with comedian Lenny Henry at a reception for British Caribbean Communities at St. James's Palace yesterday, will attend the State Opening of Parliament . The Queen receives flowers from nine-year-old Ursula Hall, nine, as she arrives for the rededication of the newly refurbished Temple Church Organ at Temple Church . The Queen, accompanied by The Duke of Edinburgh, arrives for the rededication of the newly refurbished Temple Church Organ . Buckingham Palace sources have said the Queen is to allow Prince Charles to take over the long-haul trips because of her age . Constitutional experts regard the idea . of making Charles regent – an effective co-monarch – as a controversial . and indeed unprecedented step while the Queen remains healthy. Should . it ever be contemplated, it would almost certainly require an amendment . to the Regency Acts. One well-placed source said the Queen . would ‘never, ever abdicate’ given the unhappy family history which saw . Edward VIII ‘abandon’  the throne in favour of the Queen’s father, . George VI. On the eve of her 21st birthday she . memorably vowed to serve her country for the rest of her life, ‘whether . it be long or short’. ‘But there is an increasing sense . that she cannot go on as she has been,’ the source said. ‘She is . approaching her 90s. She has extraordinary stamina for a woman of her . age. Significant: The Prince of Wales will represent the Queen, who is head of the Commonwealth, at the meeting in Sri Lanka in November. He is pictured recently with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall . Important: The Queen is pictured in Perth, Australia at the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting . But some of the more  challenging foreign trips are increasingly not possible for her and more particularly Prince Philip. Prince Charles and Camilla are to attend the State Opening of Parliament today for the first time. The royal couple will watch as the Queen sets out the government's plans for new laws for the year. It is the first time the Prince of Wales has attended since 1996 and will fuel speculation that he is taking a more active interest in the role of monarch. Charles and Camilla will travel in their own procession ahead of the Queen, Clarence House said. A Clarence House spokeswoman said: 'The Prince of Wales often supports the Queen on state occasions, and his and the Duchess's diaries were clear on this occasion.' ‘Her appointments across the  board . are going to be reviewed  and Prince Charles, who is already doing more, . will become more prominent. ‘What is being discussed is whether . that happens informally, as it has been for some time, or whether . something more formal is pursued.’ Yesterday’s short statement by . Buckingham Palace that ‘The Queen will be represented at this year’s . Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting by The Prince of Wales’ belied . the extent of thought that had gone into it. The Queen, who has attended every . meeting since 1973, views her stewardship of the Commonwealth as one of . the most important legacies of her reign and would not have taken the . decision lightly. The next meeting is due to be held in . 2015, when she will be 89. Unless it is held in London, her visit to the . Perth meeting in 2011 may turn out to have been her last. The decision to send Charles may also . have been motivated by the fact that in recent years some Commonwealth . countries have questioned whether the Prince of Wales should . automatically become head of the Commonwealth when he becomes king. Despite suggestions that the role move . to an elected individual, the Prince feels strongly that it should be . his, and his presence as the Queen’s representative can only strengthen . his case. Commonwealth Secretary-General . Kamalesh Sharma welcomed the decision, saying: ‘This decision reflects . the wish of Her Majesty at this time in her reign to limit her long . distance travel.’ Significantly, a decision about the future of Charles’s own son, Prince William, is due to be announced in two weeks. Joint visit: In 2007, both the Prince and the Queen attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Uganda. The Queen is pictured at the time . Duty: The Uganda trip was the first time Charles had been to an overseas Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and was seen as an important event for the heir to the throne . Busy: The decision to send the Prince to Sri Lanka instead of the Queen also signifies a son's commitment to easing the burden on his parents in their advancing years . It is believed that the second in line . to the throne will quit his role as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot for . an army ‘desk job’ which will allow him to take on more royal duties. This will continue the move to get . younger members of the royal family to take on more official business, . which started in earnest last year when the Queen delegated all her . foreign Diamond Jubilee travel to them. That is not to say that she or Prince . Philip, who recently returned from Toronto, won’t make any visits abroad . at all. But they will, almost certainly, be extremely few and far . between. A palace source said: ‘From now on any long-haul trips will be looked at on a case by case basis. There is no suggestion that the . Queen’s diary will become less busy but it is part of an ongoing process . looking at the Queen’s long-haul travel arrangements.’ According to the Queen’s official . list of engagements, she has seven visits planned for the rest of this . month, both with the Duke of Edinburgh. Last night the couple attended the rededication of the refurbished Temple Church Organ in the City of London.","Buckingham Palace reviewing the Queen's long-haul travel commitments .

"A pilot killed in a light aircraft crash which also claimed the life of his partner was not carrying enough fuel to safely complete the flight, an accident report has found. Pilot Gary Vickers, 58, and his passenger Kaye Clarke, 42, died after their Cessna aircraft crashed nose-down at Hawarden Airport near Chester in November 2013. The left engine of the aircraft, which Mr Vickers was flying from an aerodrome near Paris, lost power at a late stage of the approach due to fuel starvation, a report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) stated. Gary Vickers and Kaye Clarke died after Mr Vickers' light aircraft crashed in Flintshire in November last year . A picture taken at the airport captured the moment the aircraft landed nose-first  last year . Businessman Mr Vickers – whose father Gordon is a close friend of former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott – had in the weeks before the crash flown the light aircraft to the UK from his property in Andorra. The couple had later flown out to Paris for a shopping trip. They had been planning to make the return flight the day before the crash, but were delayed by stormy weather. The accident happened close to the Broughton factory of plane-making company Airbus UK. The report into the crash stated: 'The majority of usable fuel at the time of the accident was in the auxiliary tanks, which were not selected for engine feed. 'From the available evidence it is probable that the pilot originally intended to complete the flight using fuel from the main tanks only, and loaded them with what he considered to be a sufficient quantity. However, the main fuel tank quantity was insufficient for safe completion of the flight.' Accident investigators have now found that one of the plane's engines ran out of fuel before the accident . Relatives of Ms Clarke said the couple were 'devoted to each other' and Mr Vickers was a skilled pilot . The report said Mr Vickers died at the scene. Ms Clarke was rescued from the wreckage and taken to Chester hospital but died a short while later. Both were from the Chester area. Ms Clarke's devastated mother, Angela, 66, later said: ‘They idolised each other and Gary would never have put Kaye’s life in danger. Gary was a gentleman. ‘My husband has been up with him in his plane, and his flying skills were spot on. They were absolutely devoted to each other. 'They went to pop festivals together and because he was older than her he used to joke “She’s dragging me there again”. But they really enjoyed the events together.’","Businessman and his partner flew back from shopping trip a year ago .

"Louis van Gaal must be planning another soccer-market sweep in the new year, for he cannot seriously maintain that Manchester United can still win the title with a defence as shambolic as it is right now. Even with yet more investment, however, what guarantee is there of righting those wrongs? The backline which cost them another two points at West Bromwich Albion was hardly assembled on the cheap, £31million Luke Shaw and £16m Marcos Rojo chief among the culprits at The Hawthorns. Shaw arrived at Old Trafford before Van Gaal and the new manager was quick to question the physical condition of the teenager. On current evidence, this was perhaps more than the mere mind games originally suspected. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal not happy after two lost points . Manchester United players look dejected after West Brom's opening goal at The Hawthorns . Louis van Gaal will need to dip into the transfer market again if he thinks Manchester United can win the title . Rafael - £2.6m . Luke Shaw - £31m . Phil Jones - £16m . Marcos Rojo - £16m . Jonny Evans - Academy . Chris Smalling - £7m . Paddy McNair - Academy . Tyler Blackett - Academy . Reece James - Academy . Total: £72.6m . The acquisition of Rojo, meanwhile, appeared something of a token nod amid the fanfare which accompanied the signings of Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao – think the strugglers at the back of the class being ignored by the teacher in favour of the star pupils at the front. The boys at the back did need help. They needed the authority of an experienced centre back to take ownership of their rickety rearguard. They needed full backs with energy and endeavour but also defensive cunning and know-how. Perhaps a 19-year-old with the weight of such a hefty price tag was not what they needed, nor a rookie South American minus any exposure to Europe’s top leagues. At West Brom during Monday’s 2-2 draw, both Shaw and Rojo were negligent in allowing Stephane Sessegnon and then Saido Berahino to breach their backline. Rafael and Phil Jones emerged with slightly more credit, but that is like arguing the merits of a D-minus as opposed to D-plus - dodgy, dithering and deficient would all be suitable were we to apportion description to the D. Marcos Rojo (left), the £16million signing, was among the culprits on Monday night in the Midlands . Stephane Sessegnon fires West Brom ahead inside the first 10 minutes of Monday's match . But Van Gaal, bafflingly, claims United can recover to win the Premier League. It was at this juncture last season that David Moyes was making similar noises. In fairness, after eight matches, his side had conceded two fewer than Van Gaal’s and trailed the leaders by eight points, as opposed to the 10 they are adrift today. In 2012 – under Sir Alex Ferguson – they were four points off the pace. There is, then, a very definite trend. In their eighth match of the campaign under Moyes – a 1-1 draw at home to Southampton – Messrs Jones and Rafael were joined by Patrice Evra and Jonny Evans in defence. Are Shaw and Rojo really an upgrade on that pair at present? The latter, as a consequence of the former, continues to be played out of position at centre back rather than left back, further emphasising the neglect when it came to strategising defensive reinforcement. West Brom's young striker Saido Berahino picks his spot to emphatically put the home team 2-1 up . Phil Jones emerged with some credit on Monday night, but United's defence still needs to improve drastically . And what lies beneath? Tyler Blackett, an untried 20-year-old, started the season in the side, while Paddy McNair, an even less experienced 19-year-old, has appeared more recently. Talented? Yes. But Blackett and McNair sound more like a good cop/bad cop pairing from an Eighties TV show – and we don’t think they’re ready to crack the case with United’s defence just yet. Then there is Chris Smalling who, like Jones, has survived amid talk of promise and potential. Ferguson once famously said (although that is fast becoming ‘infamously’) that Jones could go on to become one of the club’s greatest-ever players. Smalling, too, was talked of in equally glowing terms. Neither, however, have subsequently shone, be that for club or country. The return to fitness of Evans, meanwhile, cannot come soon enough – and there stands a statement few would have anticipated prior to the summer splurge. United’s next two games are at home to Chelsea and away to Manchester City, where the same personnel will be charged with keeping out the opposition. But if the likes of Jamie Vardy and Benik Afobe have proved troublesome already this season, you dread to think what terror lies in wait at the feet of Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero. Indeed, talk of titles could well be hushed in a fortnight’s time.

"Flying Solo: Harrison Ford, pictured in London on Thursday, may take weeks to recover amid reports he has a pelvic injury and needed a chest x-ray . Harrison Ford has been airlifted to hospital after the Millennium Falcon spaceship crushed his ankle in an accident on the set of the latest Star Wars film. The actor, 71, clutched his chest in pain as crew members rushed to free him from underneath the prop's hydraulic door, a source revealed. He was then stretchered off set and flown to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, which specialises in fractures. Producers are now hastily rescheduling shoots to allow for what could be a lengthy absence for the actor. The incident, at the start of an evening shoot in Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, last night, came just days after fans learned the Millennium Falcon ship - piloted by Ford's character Han Solo - would appear in the new film. Reprising his buccaneering role from the early films for Star Wars: Episode VII, it is believed Ford was about to start a scene involving the 111ft vehicle. 'Harris was hit by the door and looked in a bad way and was clutching his chest when he was on the stretcher,' a source told The Mirror. The source added that he was in 'a lot of pain' and his foot appeared 'damaged'. Ford is now recovering in the trauma unit of the hospital. It is thought he fractured his ankle and is awaiting results of further tests to see if he suffered injuries to his chest. But while the actor's agent refuses to release any details of his condition, one staff member on the specialist unit could not resist tweeting about her star patient. The nurse - who calls herself Blonde Miss Bond - sparked a probe when she posted a public tweet saying: 'Surreal experience to have Harrison Ford's medical notes in the office.' The medic, who states on her Twitter account that she lives in Oxford and Podgorica in Montenegro, has now set her page to private. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We would have to verify the tweet and we would look into it.' A source told the Hollywood Reporter that Ford had been injured by the door of the Millennium Falcon. Culprit? Ford injured himself on a prop Millennium Falcon, the spacecraft piloted by Ford's Han Solo character . Revelation: The incident came just days after fans learned the Millennium Falcon will be in Star Wars: Episode VII. Director JJ Abrams shared this cryptic, tongue-in-cheek note on what appears to be the prop . Police said a 71-year-old man had been injured by a garage door, and have not commented on the spaceship claims. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police . said officers were called to the scene of the accident. He said: ‘We . were called to Pinewood studios at 5.05pm after reports of a 71-year-old . man being injured by a garage door.’ The . Health and Safety Executive has launched an investigation into the . incident. A spokesperson said: ‘We have been made aware of an incident . at Pinewood studios and are making initial enquiries.’ Ford could be entitled to claim money on the film’s insurance if the door was found to be at fault. Scene: The actor was filming at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire (pictured) when a hydraulic door fell and hit him . To the rescue: The air ambulance took him to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, which has a trauma unit that specialises in fractures . A spokesman for the film’s producers . Disney said: ‘Harrison Ford sustained an ankle injury during filming . today on the set of Star Wars: Episode VII. 'He was taken to a local hospital and is receiving care. Shooting will continue as planned while he recuperates.’ A representative for Ford was not available for comment. It is nearly 40 years since Ford starred in the first Star Wars film in 1977. Star Wars: Episode VII, which is being directed by JJ Abrams, began filming in Abu Dhabi in mid-May. The action is set 35 years after the last film they all appeared in together - 1983’s Return of the Jedi. Spotted: A fan spotted the actor shopping in a branch of Whole Foods Market (left) hours before his accident at last night. Last week, he was pictured walking through Soho with director J.J. Abrams (right) between shoots . Original: Ford as Han Solo with Chewbacca in the 1977 original movie . It will be the first Star Wars title released by Disney, after creator George Lucas sold the rights to the franchise in 2012. Mark . Hamill, 62, who played the original Luke Skywalker, and Carrie Fisher, . 57, who played Princess Leia, will also be reprising their roles. When it was rumoured that Ford may take part in a fifth Indiana Jones film last year, the American actor shrugged of accusations he is too old to take on the action role. He said: ‘I don’t think there is any barrier to Indiana Jones being an old fart. I’m old enough that we don’t need [Sean] Connery anymore – I’m old enough to play my own father.’ Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled for release in December next year.

"Cristiano Ronaldo has distanced himself from a proposed move to Manchester United. As Real Madrid's four-goal hero in their victory over Elche, Ronaldo was happy to field questions about United and Jose Mourinho on Tuesday night. Ronaldo was asked about Chelsea manager Mourinho claiming their relationship was 'non-existent'. Cristiano Ronaldo told reporters his future is at Real Madrid after scoring four goals against Elche . The Portuguese forward had been linked with a return to Manchester United next summer . 'It is an issue that is not important, what matters is Madrid,' replied Ronaldo. 'It is fine for me personally, I want to help this shirt. On these topics, it is not for me to speak out.' Asked about rumours of a new bid from United for him, he said: 'They are all speculations about my future ... My future is Madrid. I'm happy this season is going well and my future, I will not speak about, it does not make sense..' Speculation about Ronaldo's future ramped up after Real Madrid revealed debts of around £400million.

Louis van Gaal also spoke publicly about the player, insisting he would love to sign him, though also admitting he thought Madrid wouldn't sell him. A package of around £120m would be needed to bring Ronaldo back to Old Trafford, something which may be too much for United with the prospect of Radamel Falcao signing permanently next summer.

"Usually when space is short in a big city, developers build up. But a group of New Yorkers are thinking outside the box with their plans to build a new park underground. The subterranean public space will be called the Lowline, since it's based off a similar project - the High Line. Scroll down for video . Think down: The Lowline is a proposed park to be built in an abandoned underground trolley terminal on Manhattan's Lower East Side . The future of parks: Since undeveloped land is had to come by in New York, one of the project's creators believes that the Lowline can be a 21st century answer to public spaces . Inspiration: The Lowline was in part inspired by the High Line - another recycled industrial space that was turned into a park in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. Above, another mock-up of what the Lowline would look like . The High Line was originally built as a set of elevated train tracks in Chelsea. Instead of knocking the tracks down, they were saved and built into a green space. The brains behind the Lowline have a similar goal for an abandoned space underneath Delancey Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side . Deserted: The abandoned space located on the highlighted area above on Manhattan's Lower East Side, used to be a trolley terminal for trains between Manhattan and Brooklyn but service ended in 1948 . Out with the old: Above, what the 1.5 acre space looks like now . Former NASA engineer James Ramsey found out about the disused space on Manhattan's Lower East Side in 2009 from a friend who used to be a subway engineer. 'The Lowline can be the 21st century answer to traditional parks,' Mr Ramsey told The Sunday Times. 'There aren't a lot of empty plots of land in New York just waiting to be turned into new parks. Instead of building up, let's build down.' No wasting spaces: The High Line was built as a set of elevated train tracks in Chelsea but was recently turned into an above-ground park . The 1.5 acre underground space was built as the Williamsburg Trolley Terminal which transported people to and from Brooklyn and the Lower East Side, but trains stopped running in 1948 with the creation of the J/M/Z subway line. The brains: Google marketing executive Dan Barasch, left, and former NASA engineer James Ramsey, right, are the men who came up with the idea . Since then, the space has been abandoned and now Mr Ramsey and business partner Dan Barasch, a Google marketing executive, want to recycle it into something all New Yorkers can enjoy. 'Little does anyone know that . underneath Delancey is this silent beautiful space,' Ramsey told The . Sunday Times. 'We fell in love with the site because of its . architectural details: old cobblestones, crisscrossing rail tracks, . vaulted 20 ft ceilings and strong steel columns.' But . one of the biggest challenges to building the estimated $55million park . a reality was convincing the city and financial backers that the public . space wouldn't feel like a dungeon. So . they came up with an idea for transmitting light underground. They . invented a technology which absorbs light from panels above ground and . transmits the light waves under ground through fiber-optics. The . underground light won't transmit ultraviolet rays which means visitors . won't get sunburnt. But the light will be powerful enough to allow . photosynthesis, allowing trees and other plants to grow. Illumination: The group behind the park has created a new technology that gathers light above ground and transmits it underground using fiber-optics . Let there be light: The light produced underground won't have any ultraviolet rays which means visitors can't get a sunburn. But the light will be powerful enough to allow for photosynthesis meaning that trees and other plants can grow in the Lowline . In February 2012, a Kickstarter campaign raised $155,000 which allowed Ramsey and Barasch to build a full-scale model of the lighting technology. A functioning example of the lighting technology was built and installed in an abandoned warehouse above the site last year. Over 11,000 people visited the exhibit to see proof of the concept. After the exhibit, the project has gotten much closer to becoming a reality. This past summer, nine elected city, state and federal officials signed a letter expressing their support of the project. The project has also gotten a lot of support from famous New Yorkers like Lena Dunham of HBO's Girls and actor Edward Norton, who himself helped propel the High Line into creation. Dunham and Norton attended the project's star-studded 'anti-gala' last week. Supporters: Famous New Yorkers like Lena Dunham of HBO's 'Girls' (left) and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg  (right) attended last week's 'anti-gala' to support the Lowline project . The next step for Ramsey and Barash is to get the transport authority's approval to use the space. According to the Lowline's website, the group plans to have negotiations finalized, money raised and construction begin sometime between 2014 and 2017 with a 2018 grand opening.","Former NASA engineer James Ramsey and Google marketing executive Dan Barasch are the two men behind a project to build an underground park in New York .

"David de Gea’s Manchester United future was thrown into doubt on Thursday night as his agent failed to rule out a move to Real Madrid in the summer. De Gea has 18 months left on his contract and has yet to agree new terms to stay at Old Trafford as he takes stock of his future with Real watching developments. His agent Jorge Mendes, who also represents Cristiano Ronaldo, was asked by Spanish media if he could see the 24-year-old moving to Madrid. Agent Jorge Mendes has not ruled out the possibility of David de Gea joining Real Madrid . De Gea has been in outstanding form for Manchester United during the course of the season . Mendes, pictured with Radamel Falcao, has not ruled out the possibility of De Gea leaving Old Trafford . 'David is amazing, he’s brilliant,’ the Portuguese agent told Marca. ‘He’s a Man United player and has a contract there. You have to respect that but things change every five minutes.’ Despite the signing of former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes, United boss Louis van Gaal has insisted that De Gea will extend his current deal at Old Trafford. Van Gaal, whose side face Cambridge United in the FA Cup on Friday, dismissed criticism of his tactics and claimed that United’s traditional 4-4-2 formation leaves him nervous on the bench. After discussing the merits of a back three over a back four, he insisted he would ignore critics who want him to ditch his favoured 3-5-2 line-up. In a variation on Sir Alex Ferguson’s famous quote about ‘squeaky bum time’, Van Gaal said: ‘I know that with 4-4-2 the stats are giving the positive results, but when you analyse the game I have twitched my a*** on the bench because we were out of balance — I don’t like it.’ Louis van Gaal believes De Gea will sign a new deal to stay at Old Trafford despite Real Madrid's interest .

"Until recently, the dazzling visual effect caused by helicopter blades hitting sand and dust - and creating mesmerizing halos described as 'one of the most beautiful things you'll ever see in a war zone' - had no specific name; observers would simply marvel at the breathtaking sight without an understanding of what was causing it - or what to call it. Now, however - to honor the memories of two soldiers killed in the war in Afghanistan - the physics that create these types of breathtaking halos has a name: The Kopp-Etchells Effect. The effect is named after U.S. Army Ranger Benjamin Kopp and British soldier Joseph Etchells, and was given its title by photojournalist Michael Yon - who was covering the war and captured the effect in dozens of photos - as a way to honor the fallen soldiers. Pretty: Until recently, there has been no name for the halo effect that occurs when a helicopter lands in the desert . Dust: Rotors slicing through dust clouds help create the halo effect that occurs when helicopters land in the desert . Kopp-Etchells Effect: To honor slain soldiers who frequently viewed the halos, a war photographer named the effect after them . Heroes: Corporal Benjamin Kopp, left, and Corporal Joseph Etchells, right, were both killed during combat in Afghanistan in 2009 . Kopp and Etchells were killed in combat in Sangin, Afghanistan, in July of 2009. At the time of their deaths, the two men were just 22 and 21 years old, respectively. Kopp was born in Minnesota and enlisted in the Army straight out of high school, working his way up to the rank of corporal in just three short years. He completed two tours of duty in Iraq prior to his fateful tour in Afghanistan. Etchells hailed from Greater Manchester . and joined the British army in 2003. He, too, rose to the rank of . corporal, and had previous deployments before the tour in Afghanistan . that ultimately took his life. The . stories of the two soldiers aren't dissimilar from many members of the . armed services, and like most soldiers deployed in Afghanistan, the two . men likely would have been witness to the stunning halos in the night . sky that came with helicopters heading to-and-from various missions. Beautiful: the Kopp-Etchells Effect has been described as 'one of the most beautiful things you¿ll ever see in a war zone' Tragedy: The effect seen here was named after two men killed in battle in Afghanistan in 2009 . Cyclone: metallic dust spins of the blades of helicopter to create the cyclonic appearance . To honor the two men - and other brave men who, like them, spent countless nights escaping the horrors of war in the beauty of helicopter halos - Yon dedicated the effect to them. Until recently, what caused the Kopp-Etchells Effect wasn't entirely understood. One pilot told the photographer that the halos were 'a result of static electricity created by friction as materials of dissimilar material strike against each other.' Other theories were that the extreme speed of the blades moved dust particles so fast that they burned up like meteors in the atmosphere. Science blogger Kyle Hill at Nautilus, . however, explains the effect as the result of 'when a helicopter . descends into a sandy environment, the enormous downward thrust from the . blades inevitably kicks up a cloud of sand. 'Cutting through the sand and dust, the blades smash into millions of these tiny particles, . each sandblasting metal from the blade. Most of the time the only . visible consequence to the helicopter is pitting on the blades, with . enough damage warranting replacement. Every so often, however, the metal . blasted from the blades produces a miniature meteor shower.' Frequent sight: Most soldiers in combat zones witness the Kopp-Echells Effect frequently . Sawdust: metal from the wing's abrasion strips turns into a fine dust when it collides with sand and rocks from the ground . Combat: the beauty of the Kopp-Echells Effect is a welcome escape from the horrors of war . He goes on to explain that, to prevent deterioration of the blades, they are often coated with an abrasion strip, typically made of metals like titanium and nickel. 'This abrasion strip can handle a lot of wear and tear, but the desert is a harsh environment,' Hill explains. 'Sand is harder than the titanium or nickel that makes up the abrasion strip, so when a helicopter’s blades begin cutting through a cloud of sand, the particles hit the blades and send bits of metal flying into the air.' Those bits of metal come in a cloud of pyrophoric (flamable) particles, which ultimately burst into flames, thus causing the wondrous Kopp-Etchells Effect. Though beautiful, this effect is dangerous as it can blind the pilots' night vision gear. On truly dark nights a helicopter can land nearby and not be seen, but if the Kopp-Etchells Effect kicks in, then it suddenly becomes a more obvious target for enemy fire.","The Kopp-Etchells Effect was named in honor of two soldiers - one British and one American - who were killed in Afghanistan in 2009 .

"A university boss is under investigation over claims he ‘kissed’ student reps and sexually harassed female staff. William Taylor, a retired crown court judge, has stepped aside from his role as chairman of Plymouth University while the inquiry goes on. He has denied any wrongdoing and says that he will ‘robustly defend’ himself against the allegations. William Taylor, a retired crown court judge, has stepped aside from his role as chairman of Plymouth University (above) while the inquiry goes on . Mr Taylor has been accused of embarrassing colleagues by holding their hands and making smutty remarks – including a lewd comment about one of their cats. The allegations are said to concern seven women, ranging from recently graduated student representatives to senior staff at the Devon university, whose alumni includes TV wildlife presenter Monty Halls. According to the BBC, the group claim they were subjected to unwanted touching in the form of kissing or hand-holding for minutes at a time. They are also said to have complained about lewd jokes or innuendo in conversations. Three members of staff claim the retired judge joked about a sex act that might be performed on a male colleague, according to the BBC. And a woman student representative described an occasion at an awards dinner when Mr Taylor, upon seeing a picture of a cat on her mobile phone, made a crude double entendre which she said made her ‘uncomfortable’. One senior member of staff told the BBC Mr Taylor – who became chairman of the governors in 2012 - was ‘a person who was very comfortable abusing his power’, adding: ‘He was very comfortable making statements that were insinuating sexual commentary. It wasn't a person who was respecting the work that I did at the university. It was a person who decided he wanted to have titillating conversations and didn't care that I was uncomfortable, didn't care that it was unprofessional.’ South West Devon MP Gary Streeter said the scandal was ‘very unfortunate’ Mr Taylor denies the claims, which come amid a bitter internal rift that has seen vice-chancellor Wendy Purcell ‘placed on leave’ in July. Prof Purcell is believed to have submitted the sexual harassment claims on behalf of herself and other women just before she was suspended from her £288,000-a-year post. The university has not revealed the reason for Prof Purcell's suspension. A senior barrister was appointed by the university in August to support its investigation into the first set of allegations against Mr Taylor, which were received by the board in July. Plymouth University has also come under fire in recent weeks after it emerged management spent £95,000 on seven ceremonial chairs and £24,000 sending six members of staff to a conference in Miami. South West Devon MP Gary Streeter said the scandal was ‘very unfortunate’. He said: ‘I am in regular contact with the university about this. We all want this matter to be resolved as soon as possible. ‘We need a clearer message from the university that its students are being educated and it is still a good university which we can be proud of.’ Tim Jones, chairman of the Devon and Cornwall Business Council, has accused those involved of ‘washing their dirty linen in public’ and creating a ‘firestorm’. The clash has prompted the Higher Education Funding Council for England to call for an external, independent review of the university's governance. Mr Taylor’s lawyers, RPC, said: ‘Save to say that the allegations will be robustly defended, it is not appropriate to comment until that investigation is concluded.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","William Taylor, a retired crown court judge, has stepped down as chairman of Plymouth University while inquiry goes on .

"One thing the internet has shown us,  it is that few people can resist looking at images of cute . animals. Now new research has revealed that looking at cute images of . baby animals doesn’t just make you feel warm and fuzzy inside, but can actually improve . your work performance and help you concentrate. The study comes from researchers at Hiroshima University. In . Japanese, the word ‘kawaii’ means cute and so the report is rather appropriately . entitled ‘Power of Kawaii’. Concentrate: Cute images of baby animals don’t just make you feel warm and fuzzy but can actually improve your work performance . Through three separate experiments a team of scientists found . that people showed higher levels of concentration being shown pictures of . puppies or kittens. About 132 university students were divided up into three . groups, report the Wall Street Journal. Each group was assigned a different task. The first two had the most . compelling results. The first was a version of the game Operation where . participants had to carefully pick up small objects from a hole without . brushing the sides. But to also determine whether the power of cute extends . beyond care-related tasks irrelevant to helping others, another task was purely . about numbers. The second group was asked to find a given number from a . random sequence of numbers within a certain time limit. In both, they performed . the given tasks twice – before and after looking at seven pictures of either . puppies and kittens or adult versions. In the number experiment, one subset of subjects was given . food images like steak, pasta and sushi to see whether 'pleasant' images . elicited similar effects as cute ones. Just look at their faces: In the future cute images could be used to help improve behavior when driving or working . The subjects were told the pictures, which were viewed . during a 'break' in the tasks, were for a separate experiment. In the Operation experiment, the participants who were shown . images of puppies and kittens performed their tasks better after the break than . those who looked at cats and dogs. Performance scores improved by 44%. They . also took their time. The time it took to complete the task increased by 12%. 'This finding suggests that viewing cute images makes . participants behave more deliberately and perform tasks with greater time and . care,' said the researchers, according to the published paper. Similar jumps in performance were seen in the numbers . experiment, suggesting that looking at cute images increases attentiveness even . when the task at hand is unlikely to raise feelings of empathy. Feeling good: 'Kawaii' or cute things not only make us happier, but also improve our behavior . The group that saw kitten and puppies were more accurate, . improving their scores by about 16%. They were also faster, increasing the . number of random numerical sequences they got through by about 13%. There was . no change among groups that saw cats and dogs, and food images. 'Kawaii things not only make us happier, but also . affect our behavior,' wrote the researchers, led by cognitive psychologist . Hiroshi Nittono. 'This study shows that viewing cute things improves . subsequent performance in tasks that require behavioral carefulness, possibly . by narrowing the breadth of attentional focus.'

"Ronny Deila insists he never lost faith in Stefan Scepovic even though the Celtic striker missed two great chances before scoring his first goal for the Hoops in their 2-1 Europa League win over Romanian outfit Astra Giurgiu at Parkhead. The 24-year-old Serbian striker has failed to impress since signing from Sporting Gijon for a reported £2.3million in the summer and had not found the net in six appearances previous. He was only playing because John Guidetti once again had to drop out as he was not registered in time for the group stages of the competition following his loan move from Manchester City. Ronny Delia watches on during Celtic' Europa League game against Astra Giurgiu at Celtic Park . Stefan Scepovic opened the scoring for the home side in an unconvincing Europa League win on Thursday . As the Scottish champions struggled to break the deadlock against the visitors, Scepovic missed two sitters with his head early in the second half, but made amends when he headed in an Anthony Stokes free-kick in the 73rd minute. Midfielder Stefan Johansen made it 2-0, only for Gabriel Enache to pull a goal back to ensure a nervy ending but it ended with Celtic three points better off ahead of the trip to Romania for the return game on November 6. Asked if he felt Scepovic was never going to score against Astra, Deila said: 'No. That's why I kept him on the pitch. The Serbian slides on his knees after netting his first goal in Celtic colours at the seventh attempt . 'I saw the chances were coming. Stefan had two big chances before he scored but I am happy for him that he got the goal. I know what a goal scorer he is and he got the goal in the end. 'He really wants to perform for this club. He was very tense before the game, I could see it in him and there was a big relief, of course, when he scored the goal and it is not the last goal we will see from him. 'We know what he has. He is always in front of goal and smelling chances. He will go on to score more goals. You can imagine what you feel when you score your first goal. 'He will become more confident as well. I see in training that he is good on the ball and scores goals so I am very happy for him.' Celtic are level with Salzburg at the top of the section with seven points, following the Austrian side's 4-2 home win over Dinamo Zagreb. Deila believes 10 points could be enough to qualify through to the knockout stages but insists there is still a long way to go. Oleg Protasov insists his Astra side can beat the Scottish champions in the return fixture in Romania . He said: 'It could be that 10 points are enough. But I am taking nothing for granted. It is a lot of hard work in Europe, with two away games to go and there are some very even games. 'So we need to be at our best if we are to go through. 'We gave Astra some chances in the first half with some bad passes and some stupid mistakes. We were too slow and took too many touches on the ball. 'When we got to 2-0 I hoped the game was over but they came back again and that was disappointing. But in the end we won the game and in the second-half chances we had more chances.' Astra manager Oleg Protasov thought his side deserved a draw and looked to make amends in the return game. He said: 'We maybe had more chances to score but a draw was maybe the right result for both teams. 'My team tried to do their best but I would like to say my players did well and of course we would have liked a better result. 'We will try to beat them in Romania.

"Taking statins could help prevent breast cancer, new research suggests. The cholesterol-reducing drugs are already taken by seven million people in the UK, with the aim of reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. But British scientists say the cheap drugs, which cost the NHS less than £2 a month to prescribe for each person, could also drastically reduce the risk of breast cancer. A study of more than 600,000 women found that breast cancer risk was almost doubled in those with high levels of fat in their blood. A study of more than one million women in the UK over a 14-year period has suggested there is a link between high cholesterol levels and developing breast cancer . The research is still at an early stage and the findings do not yet prove that cholesterol helps trigger breast cancer. But if future work demonstrates a causal link it raises the possibility of using statins to reduce women’s risk of the disease. Cardiologist Rahul Potluri, from the University of Aston in Birmingham, said: ‘We found that women with high cholesterol had a significantly greater chance of developing breast cancer. ‘This was an observational study so we can’t conclude that high cholesterol causes breast cancer, but the strength of this association warrants further investigation. ‘A prospective study that monitors the risk of breast cancer in women with and without high cholesterol is needed to confirm what we observed. If the connection between high cholesterol and breast cancer is validated, the next step would be to see if lowering cholesterol with statins can reduce the risk of developing cancer.’ A total of 664,159 women from across the UK whose health records were stored on a national database took part in the study. Statistical analysis showed that those with high cholesterol were 1.64 times more likely to have breast cancer than women with normal levels. Around 50,000 British women develop breast cancer each year – four out of five of them in the post-menopausal years. Previous research has shown a clear association between obesity and breast cancer in post-menopausal women. And a US study last year found that a product of cholesterol, called 27HC, fuels human breast tumours in genetically engineered laboratory mice. Researchers found women with high cholesterol, or hyperlipidaemia, increased their risk of breast cancer by 1.64 times . Scientists also discovered higher levels of 27HC in both healthy breast tissue and tumour cells in women with breast cancer. Dr Potluri, who presented his  findings at a European Society of Cardiology meeting in Barcelona, Spain, said: ‘We have a general principle that obesity is linked to breast cancer and a study in mice suggested that this may be because of cholesterol. Statins are already Britain’s most . prescribed drug but new NHS guidelines to be published later this month . will dramatically increase the number of people eligible for a . prescription. At the moment . statins are available to those deemed to have a 20 per cent risk of . suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade. The . new guidelines will lower the threshold to anyone at a 10 per cent . risk, which could increase the number of people on statins by up to . 10million additional patients. The . planned shift to ‘pre-emptive’ prescribing has led some GPs to warn of a . needless ‘medicalisation’ of people who do not need drugs. But others say the chance to cheaply and effectively reduce the risk of heart attack and other diseases cannot be ignored. ‘We decided to investigate whether there was any association between hyperlipidaemia, which is high cholesterol essentially, and breast cancer.’ He added: ‘While our study was preliminary, our results are promising.’ ‘Statins are cheap, widely available and relatively safe. We are potentially heading towards a clinical trial in 10 to 15 years to test the effect of statins on the incidence of breast cancer. If such a trial is successful, statins may have a role in the prevention of breast cancer, especially in high risk groups, such as women with high cholesterol.’ Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of the Breast Cancer Campaign charity, said: ‘These are interesting results that report a link between increased fat in the blood and an increased risk of breast cancer. ‘However, this is just the first step in understanding more about how cholesterol relates to the risk of breast cancer, and more research is needed to determine whether statins could help prevent breast cancer. ‘We do know that being overweight, particularly after menopause, can increase a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer. We would encourage women to maintain a healthy weight and to discuss any concerns, such as their breast cancer risk, weight or cholesterol levels with their GP.’","A study of more than 600,000 women in the UK found a link between having high cholesterol levels and developing breast cancer .

"Sony employees have received threats to their families in the latest email from hacking group Guardians of Peace (GOP). The warning on Friday afternoon came after the firm transferred their entire mail system to new servers following a security breach that saw five feature films and 47,000 social security numbers released. Nonetheless, the email, written in broken English, told all Sony Pictures staff to join the GOP's petition against Sony 'if you don't want to suffer damage,' adding: 'not only you but your family will be in danger'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Threat: Staff at Sony Pictures have received an email threatening to harm their families if they do not comply . Investigators have speculated the hack, first detected on November 24, was administered by North Korea in reaction to the upcoming comedy The Interview, which dramatizes an assassination plot on the nation's leader Kim Jong-un. A team has worked around the clock to clear the firm's computer system and barred all staff from accessing the WiFi in the meantime. But the latest message, obtained by Variety, suggests the hacking firm plans to continue meddling with Sony. It read: 'I am the head of GOP who made you worry. Removing Sony Pictures on earth is a very tiny work for our group which is a worldwide organization. And what we have done so far is only a small part of our further plan.It's your false if you if you think this crisis will be over after some time. All hope will leave you and Sony Pictures will collapse. This situation is only due to Sony Pictures. Sony Pictures is responsible for whatever the result is. Sony Pictues clings to what is good to nobody from the beginning. It's silly to expect in Sony Pictures to take off us. Sony Pictures makes only useless efforts. One beside you can be our member. 'Many things beyond imagination will happen at many places of the world. Our agents find themselves act in necessary places. Please sign your name to object the false of the company at the email address below if you don't want to suffer damage. If you don't, not only you but your family will be in danger. Bad news: More bad news in the Sony hack as it has been reported that 47,000 Social Security numbers for past and current employees were leaked, including actress Rebel Wilson . Victims: Among those who had their information taken were  Judd Apatow (left) and Sylvester Stallone (right) 'Nobody can prevent us, but the only way is to follow our demand. If you want to prevent us, make your company behave wisely.' It comes after the details of Sony employees including director Judd Apatow and actors Rebel Wilson and Sylvester Stallone were leaked from the firm's system. The leaked numbers belong to both past and current employees of the studio juggernaut. The studio had no comment on this most recent leak according to the Wall Street Journal. It came shortly after it was revealed that financial records had became public that detailed how much stars like Seth Rogen and James Franco were making, as well as studio heads Michael Lynton and Amy Pascal. The hackers also uploaded five yet-to-be-released films to file-sharing websites, including the Brad Pitt film Fury, still in theaters, and Annie, the much-anticipated remake set for a December 19 release. Millionaires: Sony Pictures Entertainment Co-Chairman Amy Pascal (left) and Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton (right) both make $3million a year, according to the leaked documents . The company has been trying to take the videos off the internet with cease-and-desist orders. Pay information for more than 31,000 employees at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd, a financial firm hired by Sony, were taken in the hack as well. The pay information from 2005 revealed that there are far more men than women with high-paying salaries. The list was leaked to a reporter at news and pop culture site Fusion. Kevin Roose, reporting for Fusion, who was sent a link to the data by an anonymous source, said: 'When I sorted the list by 'annual rate,' I noticed something notable: a stark homogeneity among the people earning the most. 'Based on the spreadsheet ... the employees of Sony Pictures with the highest annual rates appear to be nearly entirely white men.' Buzzfeed reviewed almost 40GB of leaked internal data and reported it included 'employee criminal background checks, salary negotiations, and doctors' letters explaining the medical rationale for leaves of absence.' It reported the files also included a script for an unreleased pilot written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan as well as 'email exchanges with employees regarding specific medical treatments they are undergoing, while one disciplinary letter details a manager's romantic relationship and business travel history with a subordinate.' The leaked information even includes an email about the breastfeeding diet of a senior executive. One aspect of the leak, which probably has the Sony IT team reeling, is the several spreadsheet and text documents where employees stored their passwords...under the name 'password'. The hack is thought to be carried out by those allied with the North Korean regime, unhappy with the country's portrayal in the film. In June, a North Korean official appeared on the state-run news station to say the country would pursue 'a strong and merciless countermeasure' if Sony released the film. Despite the threat, Sony has continued to roll out promotion for the movie ahead of it's December 25 release date. Paydays: Seth Rogen took home $8.4million working on The Interview, compared to the $6.5million his co-star James Franco made (left), according to information revealed in the recent cyber attack on Sony . Responsible? Sources close to the internal investigation of the hack at Sony say they believe a North Korean group is behind the attack. Officials in North Korea previously threatened action . Exactly one month before it was set to be released, Sony confirmed that the company had been hacked, and that the mysterious group behind the cyber attack released hundreds of company documents online. The day before, an alleged warning posted to Reddit read: 'This is just the beginning'. Sony has yet to officially name North Korea as the source of the cyber attack, but sources close to the internal investigation spoke out on Wednesday to say they believe a group known as DarkSeoul is to blame. The group associated with North Korea was thought to be behind the large-scale March 2013 attack on South Korean banks and broadcasters. Other evidence from the hack points to the regime, including Korean-language coding, in similarities to other attacks by DarkSeoul. The results of the internal investigation into the attack, currently being carried out by FireEye's Mandiant forensics unit, are expected to be announced later this week. Earlier this week, a North Korean spokesperson refused to deny claims that it was behind the move and would only say 'wait and see' when asked if Pyongyang was involved.

"Wilfried Bony's move to Manchester City is set to be completed after Swansea accepted an offer worth close to £30million. Sportsmail understands the initial fee is £25m up front, plus a further £3m if City win the Barclays Premier League, Champions League or FA Cup during Bony's contract. Swansea had been locked in talks with the Barclays Premier League champions over the structuring of the transfer, with City having to satisfy Financial Fair Play criteria to enable a move for the prolific 26-year-old. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Garry Monk discuss Wilfried Bony's transfer . Manchester City are set to sign Wilfried Bony after ongoing talks with Swansea City over a £30million deal .

Bony scores past Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart in November as Swansea lost 2-1 at the Etihad . But after those issues were resolved, City will now wrap up their move for the striker, who will not be available for selection until he returns from the African Cup of Nations. Bony is currently in Abu Dhabi – the home of City's owners - with the Ivory Coast national side ahead of the African Cup of Nations. But it is understood personal terms have been agreed on a four-year contract worth in the region of £100,000 a week. That is close to double what the striker, who has scored 34 goals in 70 games at Swansea, is earning at the Liberty Stadium. He said on Saturday: 'I really want to win something in my career. That is what I'm working for.' It remains to be seen if Bony's belated arrival will resurrect the title bid of a side that has been desperately lacking available strikers. But Yaya Toure said: 'Manchester City are always a club that wants important players like Bony and Aguero, they always want to progress and be at the top of the Premier League. 'If you want to be at the top of the Premier League you need to sign the top players and Bony is one of them at the moment.

'It will be tough to win the title again as Chelsea are in a good moment. 'It is not finished and we need to compete well and do the business and again.' Speaking last week, Bony said: 'Every player wants to play in the Champions League and World Cup - so it's the wish of every player. 'When you get the opportunity, sometimes it happens, sometimes not, but I am just taking things day by day.' Bony joined Swansea for an initial £12m in summer 2013 and extended his contract to 2018 last November. Crucially, the deal removed a £19m release clause that was included in the original. Liverpool had been interested but are understood to have been put off by his wage demands. It is also understood Swansea are considering a move for Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse.

"Former Manchester United striker Diego Forlan believes Radamel Falcao has been put under too much pressure to perform since returning from his knee injury. Falcao sustained ligament damage in January last year and didn't return to fitness until after the World Cup. The Colombian ace then joined United on loan from Monaco but has failed to live up to his billing.

'There was pressure on him to make it back for the World Cup last summer with Colombia,' Forlan said in his column in The Nation. 'Maybe too much, it was unrealistic.' 'Falcao had played very little football when he signed for Manchester United, the world's greatest football club. 'Because Falcao had built this huge reputation and because he was earning a lot of money, great things were expected, but it was never going to be straightforward. 'Nobody comes back from a serious injury and is the same after a month or even three months. Psychologically, you need to build your confidence back up and you hope there are no complications.

"Clemson University has stopped all fraternity activities one day after a student died falling 20ft off a bridge into a lake following a run with his frat brothers. Tucker Hipps, 19, was found dead on Monday night under a highway bridge hours after the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity reported him missing. However, the South Carolina university and police have so far not tied the death to fraternity hazing despite mounting social media speculation that he died during an initiation ritual. Hipps, 19, was running with fellow Sigma Phi Epsilon members before dawn on Monday when he started falling behind, authorities said. Fraternity members noticed Hipps wasn't at breakfast and reported him missing to university police at 1:45 p.m. Authorities are currently investigating claims that 19-year-old student Tucker Hipps' recent death was hazing-related . His body was found under the bridge just west of campus a few hours later, according to deputies and university officials. They say he fell more than 20 feet from a state highway bridge over the Seneca River to the shallow water below. Oconee . County deputies said Wednesday that there is no evidence Tucker Hipps' death was a result of hazing, but they are still trying to piece . together what happened. However, The Tiger News . reports that a representative from the national office of Hipps' fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, came to campus to investigate the hazing . claims. Officials haven't found anyone who saw him fall Monday, sheriff's office spokesman Jimmy Watt said. On Tuesday, the university enacted a ban on social activities for all 24 fraternities on campus. In a statement, Vice President for Student Affairs Gail DiSabatino cited reports of possible criminal activities and violations of the university's code of conduct - ranging from alcohol-related medical emergencies to sexual misconduct - for the move. DiSabatino called Hipps' death tragic but did not say it was responsible for or related to the ban. The suspension is intended to give fraternities time to work with other student and campus organizations to make sure members stay safe, university spokesman John Gouch said. ""They didn't want to put a deadline on it because they wanted to give everyone plenty of time to think,"" Gouch said. Clemson placed similar restrictions on Greek organizations four years ago, also after allegations of criminal activities . Students organized an impromptu vigil for Hipps on Tuesday, raising cellphones above their heads instead of candles. University President Jim Clements joined the remembrance and said everyone who knew Hipps called him a leader and a good man. Detectives have interviewed about 50 people so far, including the fraternity members running with Hipps who have been cooperative, Watt said. ""We haven't talked to anyone who saw him fall,"" Watt said. ""We don't know why he ended up in the water."" The national Sigma Phi Epsilon organization said in a statement that if foul play was involved in Hipps' death, it would make sure those responsible are brought to justice. Clemson University has suspended all fraternity activities after reports of alcohol abuse and sexual misconduct . Hipps died after reportedly going on a run with fellow fraternity members and being unable to keep up . A statement from the college added that the sheriff's office is investigating Hipps' death. 'We are cooperating and also conducting our own investigation,' DiSabatino said. 'We're terribly saddened by Tucker's death. It's always tragic when someone so young and promising is lost. Our hearts go out to his family and friends.' Students have been provided with grief counseling services. After Hipps did not appear at breakfast friends went searching for him, and his body was finally discovered that afternoon in a lake . A roundup of recent Clemson student legal troubles at Jezebel notes that six undergrads were arrested on felony drug charges in April in a sting operation authorities called 'Spring Tiger.' According to The Tiger News those students were charged with a variety of crimes related to the sale or possession of marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms. The reports did not specify whether those charged had fraternity connections. The university placed similar restrictions on Greek organizations four years ago.","Tucker Hipps' body was found in Hartwell Lake Monday and investigation into the cause of death continues .

"Per Mertesacker has told Arsenal's shellshocked players to raise their game after the disastrous defensive performance against Anderlecht. Arsenal were leading their Group D clash 3-0 against the Belgian champions with half an hour left to play when they came back to draw 3-3 at the Emirates.

Per Mertesacker (right) admits he and his Arsenal team-mates must raise their game in upcoming matches . Anderlecht striker Aleksandar Mitrovic (right) heads a late equaliser for his side against the Gunners . The Arsenal defender, now preparing for Sunday's trip to the Liberty Stadium to play Swansea, said: 'We will bounce back quickly and we are really good at that and have shown that a couple of times. 'It was a good warning and everyone should raise their game and give 10 per cent more when it is really needed. 'Anyway we have to defend better as a team. Even when we drop they always look dangerous. We need to be more aware of that. Everyone in the team has to be involved to defend. 'We cannot afford that we have just five or six players defending and just the back four. That's what we lacked especially in the final third in the last 20 minutes. Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez looks dejected after Anderlecht's late equaliser at the Emirates on Tuesday . Mitrovic runs off to celebrate his decisive goal in front of Anderlecht's travelling supporters . 'It will be a tough game at Swansea. It will be totally different we cannot compare any game to one another.' Although Arsenal only need one more point to ensure progress to the Champions League second round, their defence was brutally exposed by Anderlecht's stirring comeback. Despite the team's disastrous defending, Arsenal had kept clean sheets in their previous two games — against Sunderland and Burnley — before the spectacular Champions League collapse. Mertesacker added: 'There is nothing to explain about that. I think everyone knows what happened actually. Everyone saw it, there is nothing to explain particularly. The team is very disappointed and it is a small setback for us. But we are good at bouncing back very quickly after small setbacks. This is a small one, it's a good warning I think.'

"Tiger Woods bounced back from his opening day doom at the Hero World Challenge as he fired a two-under-par 70 on Friday. The 38-year-old is making his comeback this week after four months out through injury and had a nightmare first round as he sunk to the bottom of the leaderboard after an opening 77. That round will almost certainly have ended any chance the 14-time major winner had of winning the tournament he annually hosts which benefits his foundation, but only a double-bogey on the last stopped him from dipping into the 60s on Friday. Tiger Woods disposes of his driver after a wayward shot off the tee during his second round in Florida . Woods opened with a birdie but gave that shot back on eight before an eagle on the par-five 13th brought his round to life. A birdie followed on 14 and another on 16 had Woods four under for the day but a rain delay of around 90 minutes after he came off 17 halted his momentum and a flat finish on the last meant he was three-over for the tournament. Despite taking seven shots less than he did in his opening round, Woods did not feel that his play was markedly better on Friday. 'It wasn't a whole lot different,' he told Sky Sports 4. 'I maybe hit two less worse shots than I did yesterday, but it really wasn't that much different.' Woods keeps an eye out for his errant tee shot on the seventh hole, as the American continued to struggle . The 14-time Major winner looked despondent after another off target shot during his comeback tournament . Woods has spent a lot of time away from the game in recent years and admits it is not always easy to get back into his rhythm. 'Sometimes it takes me a few holes, sometimes it can only take me a shot to feel like I'm back into tournament mode,' he added. 'It all depends on my preparation, but also it depends on my feels.' Woods was still propping up the leaderboard, but at the other end Jordan Spieth had opened up a two-shot lead over Henrik Stenson. Jordan Spieth surged into the lead with a five under par second round before play resumes on Saturday . The weather delay meant that the later starters were playing in almost total darkness and Spieth was five under for his round and 11 under for the tournament when he picked up his ball on 18 and he will return to finish on Saturday morning. The 21-year-old reached the turn level after two birdies and a double bogey but he picked up shots on 10, 12,13, 14 and 16 to overhaul Stenson. 'If I did it over again, I may have stopped playing on 17,' he said. 'But I thought we may be able to get it in here. 'With a tricky lie down there into the green it's just a good idea to hit that pitch tomorrow.' Woods, searching for his ball after a wayward tee shot on the seventh, managed to recover on the back nine . Stenson finished with a 68 and would have been alongside Spieth were it not for bogeys on 15 and 16 which dropped him into second after six birdies in his first 13 holes. Patrick Reed was a further shot back after registering the low round of the day with a 63 and he admitted that, after reaching the turn in 29, his mind wandered to going sub-60. 'After I birdied 10 it kind of got in my mind, but I thought it for about hole 11 and 12 and after that I was like, 'you just need to get back and play golf'.' Justin Rose was also on eight under courtesy of a 64 which saw him birdie nine of his last 13 holes after dropping over par for the day with a double bogey on five. Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker were a further shot back with Jason Day, Keegan Bradley, Chris Kirk and Zach Johnson all on six under. Steve Stricker was the only other player alongside Spieth who did not finish their round and he will return to the 18th green on Saturday morning.

"Killer: Joshua Malmgren, 33, of Lower Township, New Jersey received an 18 year sentence . A drunk driver who  killed two teenage girls after he took his eyes off the road to text  branded himself a 'monster' when he was sentenced to  18 years in prison. Joshua Malmgren, 33, of Lower Township, New Jersey received a nine-year sentence for each victim. He pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter in September The Press of Atlantic City reports. 'I am a monster. I am so lost,' he said after expressing remorse. In July 2012, Malmgren was driving on Bayshore Road in the Del Haven section of Middle Township around 9:16 p.m. when his sport-utility vehicle drifted off the road and struck the two girls. He killed Nioami Lazicki-Gaston, 15, of Middle Township and Ashley Dauber, 13 of Philadelphia, who were walking to get ice cream. He narrowly missed Gaston's 14-year-old sister, Farrahanne Gaston. After the accident he quickly stopped and called 911. However, both girls died at the scene. Police said he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.18, or more than twice the state's legal limit. And friends said he had driven to a liquor store three times earlier that day to buy beer and Sambuca. Killed: Ashley Dauber (left) and Nioami Lazicki (right) were walking home from a playground when they were hit by Malmgren, who veered off the road while texting . He was also taking prescription pain medicine for a broken left arm that exacerbated the effects of the alcohol, according to court records. Yet when two of his friends noticed that he was intoxicated and offered him a ride home he refused. The sentencing hearing began with a video slideshow that showed family photos of the victims, accompanied by music from performers including Eric Clapton and Guns n' Roses. First Assistant Prosecutor Rob Johnson said Malmgren was texting when he took his eyes off the road. The prosecutor asked the judge to give him a heavy sentence to warn  others not to drink, drive and text. The court room was full of the family of the teenage girls. At the start of the hearing, the girls’ teenage faces stared back at the defendant from twin easels. Driver: Joshua Malmgren, of Lower Township, right, sits with his attorney Ed Weinstock as he listens to victim impact statements during his sentencing . Their families told how Gaston would have been a senior this year at Cape May County Technical High School where she was planning to study criminal justice. Gaston's distraught sister read an essay to the court that her sister wrote before her death about the love she felt for her family. Dauber’s sister, Kaitlyn Dauber, told Malmgren: 'I won’t be able to hear her voice again. I won’t be able to do her hair on her wedding day. I miss her so much.' His actions have devastated the Gaston family. Happy: Ashley Dauber (right) was visiting from Philadelphia when the tragedy occurred, but the younger sister of Nioami Lazicki (left) managed to escape Malmgren's car . Tears: Family members of Nioami Lazicki-Gaston, console each other during the sentencing of Joshua Malmgren, in Cape May . Remorse: Joshua Malmgren is led out of the Cape May County superior courtroom, after he was sentenced to 18 years state prison on Friday December 5 . Bill Gaston said: 'Nioami was always more worried about others than herself. Sometimes, I swear I can hear her tell me it’s OK. The pain that rests in our hearts is just as heavy today.' Court staff handed out three boxes of tissues to family members who sobbed throughout the hearing. The defendant was also in tears. Before the accident, Malmgren had been assistant manager of a convenience store. He also had custody of his two children, including a disabled child. The crash was his first DWI, but he did have an assault charge as a juvenile. Nioami's sister, Farrahanne Gaston, told Malmgren that she forgave him. 'I forgive you not because you deserve it, but because I deserve peace,' she said.","Joshua Malmgren, 33, from Lower Township sobbed in court .

"Borussia Dortmund lifted themselves off the bottom of the Bundesliga with a 1-0 victory over Hoffenheim - their second league win in 11 matches. Ilkay Gundogan's first-half header was enough to give the hosts a much-needed three points as they ended their barren run of form with a morale-boosting win. Jurgen Klopp made five changes to the team which lost to Frankfurt, with goalscorer Gundogan the main inclusion from these selections. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Borussia Dortmund 1-0 Hoffenheim . Jurgen Klopp jumps for joy after seeing his Borussia Dortmund side take the lead against Hoffenheim .

Borussia Dortmund: Langerak; Piszczek, Subotic, Hummels, Schmelzer; Bender, Kehl; Aubameyang (Immobile 92), Gundogan (Ginter 91), Mkhitaryan; Ramos (Grosskreutz 83). Subs not used: Weidenfeller, Kagawa, Sahin,  Durm. Goals: Gundogan 17 .

After a cagey opening period to the game it was Dortmund who took the lead in the 17th minute. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's cross from the right-hand side was met with a fierce diving header from Gundogan, as the hosts got off to the perfect start at Signal Iduna Park. The relief on Klopp's face was clear for all to see, as the Dortmund boss leapt into the air in pure relief and ecstasy at the same time. The visitors looked to get a foothold back into the game immediately, and went close to doing just that on 37 minutes. Sven Schipplock had the goal at his mercy,  but the lone striker could only drag his shot well wide, spurning a golden opportunity for the visitors to get back on level terms.

The visitors made one change at the break with Anthony Modeste brought on to replace the less-than-impressive Schipplock, as they searched for an all-important equaliser. Hoffenheim had the early momentum after the interval and would have got themselves level, if it wasn't for a crucial interception from Mats Hummels. On 53 minutes Dortmund thought they had doubled their lead through Aubameyeng as he nodded home at the far post following an inswinging corner from Gundogan, with Klopp far from pleased at the decision to disallow the goal, seemingly for being in an offside position. Unbelievably, the Gabon international was denied yet again by the offside flag on 72 minutes, as he drilled the ball home from close range, but yet again his goal was ruled out. Luckily for the hosts a solitary goal was enough to hand them all three points, as the visitors huffed and puffed to no avail in the latter stages, as Klopp's side moved off the bottom of the table in the process.

"A police inquiry into a Maoist cult that allegedly kept three women as slaves for 30 years descended into farce yesterday when one of the suspects was told she would not be charged. After spending nearly a year on bail, Chanda Pattni, 67, was told she would not be prosecuted over the allegations. Her husband, sect leader Aravindan Balakrishnan, 73, who used the title ‘Comrade Bala’, remains on bail pending further inquiries into the slavery claims concerning three alleged victims – a 30-year-old Briton, a 57-year-old Irishwoman and a 69-year-old Malaysian. The property in Lambeth, south London, where Chanda Pattni and her husband Aravindan Balakrishnan were accused of keeping three women as slaves; today police said Ms Pattni will face no further action . A police officer stands guard at the property where three women were . kept as slaves before one contacted a charity which then alerted . police . The Maoist couple at the centre of the . slavery probe – said to be originally from India and Tanzania – were . held after one of the alleged victims contacted a charity, claiming she . had been brainwashed into remaining in a political collective in South . London for decades. As . detectives continued their inquiries into Balakrishnan last night, it . was unclear whether there will be sufficient evidence to charge him with . any slavery-related offences. Since his first arrest, he has also been accused of serious sex offences – details of which the Met have not revealed. Should . he escape charges over the original allegations, which prompted a blitz . of publicity, Scotland Yard is likely to face difficult questions about . its initial handling of the case. Soon after Balakrishnan and his wife . were first arrested last November, senior officers talked in emotive . terms about the victims’ alleged ordeals at the hands of a slavery . ‘criminal network’. Detective . Inspector Kevin Hyland, from the Met’s Human Trafficking Unit, . described the case as ‘extraordinary’, saying officers believed the . 30-year-old had spent her whole life in ‘servitude’. Another senior officer said police believed victims had been kept captive in ‘invisible handcuffs’. This . prompted Home Secretary Theresa May, other senior politicians and . campaigners to speak out against slavery in Britain. Mrs May spoke of . ‘eradicating the scourge of modern slavery’ and described it as a . ‘personal priority’. Mr Balakrishnan, who is accused of sexual offences, has been re-bailed until December . But . within days, it emerged that the alleged victims had not been kept under . lock and key and at least one talked freely with neighbours in Brixton. It also emerged that the ‘cult household’ was known to local . authorities and that Balakrishnan and his wife were well known to the . police. Described as a ‘guru’, the economics graduate was said to have a . band of devoted female followers under his ‘spell’. Known . as ‘Comrade Bala’, he came to police attention after setting up a . communist squat, the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre, in Brixton in 1976 . where the couple ran their group, the Workers’ Institute of . Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse Tung Thought, holding lectures and film . evenings. He had been kicked out of the Communist Party’s national . executive after his faction ‘attempted to put themselves above the . discipline of the party’. Balakrishnan . and his wife were arrested following the rescue of the three women from . their home in Brixton. The alleged victims were said to have found the . courage to act after watching a TV documentary about forced marriages on . October 9 last year, which featured an organisation called Freedom . Charity, prompting the Irish woman to call its helpline. The charity’s founder, Aneeta Prem, subsequently spoke about the ‘danger’ the women were alleged to have been in. Scotland .

"Alan Pardew admits he feared losing the one he loves — midfielder Cheick Tiote. Newcastle travel to Stoke’s Britannia Stadium on Monday night with Tiote having made a timely return to fitness for his under-fire boss. The Ivorian, though, had his head turned by interest from Lokomotiv Moscow during the summer and was thought to be keen on a move to Russia.

Tiote challenges Emmanuel Riviere (centre) during training on Saturday ahead of the Stoke match . Tiote being assisted by team-mate Mike Williamson during the home draw against Hull . Tiote remained on Tyneside after Lokomotiv failed to make an acceptable offer but, with his contract set to expire in 2016, Pardew is keen for talks to open over a new deal. Asked if the interest had unsettled the 28-year-old, the Newcastle manager said: ‘Yes, for sure. ‘We obviously had a team fighting for his services, but the finance was never really in place. ‘I think his contract situation needs to be resolved at the end of the season, for sure. ‘I love him. He’s everything that you want in a Newcastle player. ‘He has the quality, and of course you’ll never underestimate the fact that he wants to win. ‘That’s something we have to be very careful about on training days!’ Pardew added: ‘I just love that he’s a winner. It can overcome so many obstacles as a footballer. ‘I think young players here need to take a big leaf out of his book in terms of how he approaches training and games. ‘Sometimes it can overspill into bookings and sendings off, but you can never fault him for wanting to win.’ If Pardew’s players have proved anything in the past 10 days it is that they’re behind their manager. A come-from-behind 2-2 draw with Hull followed by a 3-2 victory at Crystal Palace in the Capital One Cup showed as much. And he believes his vice-captain Tiote and skipper Fabricio Coloccini have set the standard. ‘You do need big players at this football club,’ Pardew went on, his position having been made safe in the short term at least. ‘Colo and Tiote are two very important players for us. They showed that on Wednesday night and last Saturday. ‘They have the fight and the quality. You can’t fight your way to a Premier League win — you have to play. They’ve got that balance right.’ Alan Pardew, at Newcastle's training ground on Saturday with sprinklers going off, is glad Tiote isn't leaving . Stoke manager Mark Hughes has laughed off Manchester City counterpart Manuel Pellegrini’s comments claiming his side are a ‘small team’. Describing the match with Chelsea, Pellegrini said: ‘It was very similar to the Stoke team, with a big team playing against a small team with very good players, trying to defend, trying to keep the score (0-0).’ Hughes said: ‘He was possibly disappointed with the way Chelsea approached the game but we didn’t take any umbrage with it, as criticism of ourselves.’ Hughes has no fresh injury concerns, with only midfielder Jonathan Walters a doubt with a calf problem.","Cheick Tiote had his head turned by interest from Lokomotiv Moscow .

"It may look like a hi-tech instrument of torture, but this strange gadget is an exoskeleton for the hand. The device, called Dexmo, can be used to control robots as well as with virtual reality headsets to make video games more immersive. The exoskeleton uses haptic feedback to allow wearers to feel the size of a visual object they are touching on screen. Scroll down for video . The exoskeleton called Dexmo, can be used to control robots and with virtual reality games for a more immersive experience, with the aid of a VR headset, such as the Oculus Rift . Dexmo has been created by a Chinese company called Dexta Robotics, which is raising money on Kickstarter in order to put its device into production. Engineers at the company claim they have created: ‘an affordable mechanical exoskeleton system with force feedback for you to touch the digital world and captures your hand motion.' Dexmo comes in two versions – classic and more advanced F2 - which includes the haptic feedback. The exoskeleton (pictured centre and right) uses haptic feedback to allow wearers to feel the size of a visual object they are touching on screen (shown left) and could be used alongside an Oculus Rift headset . Engineers at the company claim they have created: ‘an affordable mechanical exoskeleton system with force feedback for you to touch the digital world and captures your hand motion. Here, a wearer of the F2 version 'feels' a virtual cube shown on a computer screen . The Dexmo exoskeleton is designed to be worn on the hand. It comes in two versions - the classic and F2 - both of which can be used to control robots or with a virtual reality headset, in order to play games. The F2 exoskeleton uses haptic feedback to allow wearers to feel the size of a visual object they are touching on screen. It does this thanks to two contraptions - joint gear-disk braking mechanisms - positioned on the index finger and thumb of the exoskeleton . When contact with an object is detected, either by a programme or a pressure sensor, a signal is sent to the device, activating the actuators and the joints to lock the exoskeleton. This action prevents the finger from bending further inwards - creating a force on the user's fingertip. The device can be used in a number of ways, including to control lighting, play a virtual piano and used as a tool to make music and paint in computer programmes. The classic version is simply an input device, so it can be used to control the mechanical hands of robots for example. It captures 11 degrees of hand motion including the rotation of the thumb and the bending of four fingers. The group of engineers and computer scientists came up with Dexmo after noticing a lack of affordable hand motion capturing devises in the field of robotics and virtual reality. After 17 versions, they managed to create an immersive exoskeleton with force feedback – the F2. The more advanced version provides wearers with digital force feedback for their index finger and thumb, which allows them to ‘feel’ a digital object. The engineers say the device can be used to control a robotic hand ‘providing you with a better sense of presence by simulating a force feedback when an object is hit’. ‘With Dexmo F2, we can take virtual reality to its next level, it adds a sense of touch to gaming and now you can now feel the size of a digital object,' they explained, adding that the device doesn’t allow a wearer to feel softness yet. The engineers have used the device to control lighting (pictured), as a tool to be used in music production and art computer programmes and to play a virtual piano . The classic version is simply an input device, so it can be used to control the mechanical hands of robots for example. The more advanced F2 model can be used in the same way. Here, a complex set-up of robotic arms and the Deximo devices show how they can be used to dispose of a mock-up bomb .

"After playing a major part in Anderlecht's dramatic comeback against Arsenal in the Champions League, you can't blame Anthony Vanden Borre for wanting to read all about in the morning papers.

"Hard as he tried to duck it, the issue of Louis van Gaal’s notoriously frosty relationship with Ronald Koeman would not go away. Van Gaal stonewalled, he bristled. He even offered up some grudging respect to his former assistant in an attempt to change the subject. But nothing could alter the fact that when Manchester United go to Southampton on Monday night, all eyes will be on the feuding Dutch duo. Intriguingly, Koeman is one point and one place ahead of his rival going into their clash at St Mary’s. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal: My relationship with Koeman is private . Manchester United's Louis van Gaal refused to discuss his relationship with Southampton's Ronald Koeman . Koeman (pictured) and Van Gaal have had a frosty relationship for over 10 years since they worked at Ajax . ‘I don’t have to describe my relationship with the trainer of the opponent,’ said the United boss. ‘That’s more private I think. We play against Southampton and we have to speak about Southampton and not the trainer-coach.’ The two had clashed as players but their managerial fallout dates back to Van Gaal’s arrival at Ajax as technical director 10 years ago when Koeman was head coach at the club. Koeman objected to Van Gaal pulling up a chair in training and observing the session in the overbearing manner of a schoolmaster. In turn, Van Gaal felt Koeman was ‘weak’ in his handling of star players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and blamed the coach for undermining him when he was ousted from the job a year later. Two men who had previously worked well at Barcelona, and whose wives Truus and Bartina had become best friends in Spain, were no longer on speaking terms. Van Gaal (right) and Koeman had run-ins with one another during their playing days in Holland . The pair worked well together though at Barcelona when Koeman (right) became Van Gaal's assistant . Their relationship changed when  working at Ajax, where they brought a young Filipe Luis to Amsterdam . The pair’s feud began when Van Gaal was appointed technical director of Koeman’s Ajax side in 2004. Koeman took issue with the way Van Gaal would get involved in training sessions, and Van Gaal labelled his compatriot ‘weak’ and felt the need to step in to break up a fight between team-mates Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Rafael van der Vaart during one of Koeman’s sessions. On the last day of the summer transfer window in 2004, Van Gaal accepted a bid from Juventus for Ibrahimovic, which angered Koeman, who had no time to sign someone to replace him before the window shut. Van Gaal claimed Koeman ‘engineered his departure from Ajax’ that same year, and declared: ‘I’ll never have dinner with Koeman again’. But Koeman insists: ‘That is his story. My story is different’. In a 2014 biography Van Gaal rekindled the bitter rivalry, stating: ‘The real problem at Ajax was Koeman no longer had control over the group (at Ajax). In principle, Koeman should have solved that, but he couldn’t.’ When Koeman later succeeded Van Gaal at AZ Alkmaar, the latter suggested that his replacement was third-choice on the club’s list. More recently, it has been claimed that Van Gaal took great delight in building a more expensive villa than Koeman’s in the Portuguese resort where they are sometimes neighbours. The United manager could not help but point to the difference in size and stature of their clubs yesterday when asked about the impressive job Koeman and his brother Erwin, Southampton’s assistant, have done on the south coast despite joining a club that had just offloaded some of their best players in the summer. United signed one of them, Luke Shaw for £28million, and were linked with Adam Lallana who ended up at Liverpool with Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren. ‘Southampton have a very good squad,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I know a lot of players and a lot of players were offered to us. But when Manchester United is coming, clubs are always asking more money and we have to pay because we are United. ‘Do you think Southampton pay too much for players? I don’t think so, because they are Southampton. There is always a relationship between Real Madrid and Manchester United and teams like Aston Villa and Southampton.’ On reports that United are set to spend upwards of £100m to continue overhauling the squad the manager added: ‘I think it’s disgusting always writing about numbers. It’s disrespectful to my players.’ And when asked about the depleted squad Koeman inherited, Van Gaal turned the question around. ‘I have heard that in the media,’ he added. ‘Do you know how many players we lost? I have never read that. We have lost more players but Ronald Koeman is a very good coach and I know he can do it. It’s always surprising that a club like Southampton are in that position but that’s a matter of coach, players and staff and when you do that it’s very good. They are able to finish in the top four but that’s also because I believe in the management of Ronald Koeman and his brother. When the cohesion is good he can manage.’ United have Wayne Rooney (left) available for Monday's clash but Southampton will be without Jack Cork . Van Gaal will make the trip to St Mary’s with his captain Wayne Rooney after confirming that the England striker has recovered from the knee injury that kept him out of Wednesday’s win over Stoke at Old Trafford. Southampton’s midfield options are becoming stretched, with Jack Cork facing at least six weeks on the sidelines. The 25-year-old will not play again this year after sustaining ankle-ligament damage in the Wednesday’s late 1-0 defeat at Arsenal. Cork’s absence compounds an increasingly tough situation for the Saints in central midfield, with James Ward-Prowse and Morgan Schneiderlin also out of contention for Monday’s match with United. Toby Alderweireld has helped fill the void in the past two matches but he is a doubt with a hamstring injury. Koeman said: ‘Jack Cork has ankle-ligament damage and he will be out for maybe more than six weeks. Toby has fatigue in his muscle and is doubtful.’ The injuries mean 19-year-old Harrison Reed could make his first Premier League start alongside the likes of Victor Wanyama and Steven Davis. ‘He is ready,’ said Koeman. ‘He’s a young player and he has to develop himself, but I’m a manager at a club that likes to develop young players.’ Toby Alderweireld (left) is also a doubt for the Saints with a hamstring injury suffered against Arsenal .","Southampton host Manchester United in Monday Premier League's clash .

"Jaydon Gibbs can pinpoint the exact moment he knew his twin brother Kieran would make it big. The pair were representing Croydon Schools when their manager, David O'Brien, confidently predicted that the youngest of the Gibbs brothers would become a Premier League star. Considering they were just '13 or 14' at the time, it turned out to be some foresight. But Gibbs Junior wasn't always the most talented footballer in the family. 'He hates me talking about this,' says Jaydon, who is preparing to face Rochdale in the second round of the FA Cup on Sunday with Vanarama Conference side Aldershot. Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs and his twin brother Jaydon smiles for the camera posing for a school photo . Jaydon plays for Aldershot Town, who play four divisions below Arsenal, the club of his famous brother Kieran . The Gibbs brothers pose during an afternoon stroll in the countryside and have a close relationship . Jaydon poses outside Aldershot's Recreational Ground ahead of the club's FA Cup clash with Rochdale . 'We were about 10 or 11 and on trial at a club called Tandridge. I got picked and he didn't but my mum had a word with the coach and asked if they could take us both as we were twins.' The club listened to the boys' mother and Kieran hasn't looked back since, having gone on to establish himself as a key member of Arsenal's back-four and a part of Roy Hodgson's England plans. Jaydon's path to the professional game hasn't been as straightforward as his sibling, who was born 45 minutes after him in Lambeth, south London. After being released by the Gunners at 15, he spent six months at Leyton Orient before falling out of love with the game and quitting. 'I decided that if I wasn't at Arsenal then I didn't really want to play football,' he says. 'I just wanted to do what my mates were doing - getting jobs and going out.' His desire to forge a career for himself returned through spells in non-league with Guildford City and Chipstead before the opportunity to play full-time for The Shots was offered to him in August, 2013. This weekend's game against League One Dale is arguably the biggest of his career, particularly given the potential prize on offer. 'It's always in the back of your mind that you could be facing a Premier League team or a side from the Championship,' he says cautiously. The pair, pictured  in Arsenal strips as kids, both played for the Gunners before Jaydon was released aged 15 . Kieran Gibbs, pictured next to Arsenal team-mate Aaron Ramsey, celebrates the Gunners' 2014 FA Cup win . Kieran and Jaydon, pictured on bikes on holiday, have grown much closer as they have got older . 'The dream tie for me would be Arsenal but that's a long way away. We've got to get the result on Sunday and we don't want to look too far ahead. The boys are buzzing for it.' Victory for Andy Scott's side at the ESS Stadium would create the possibility of a third round meeting with Arsene Wenger's FA Cup holders, a fixture which would almost certainly see left back Kieran go head-to-head with right back Jaydon. 'I don't think my mum would like it, especially given the positions we play!' he says with a hint of seriousness. 'When we both played at Arsenal we didn't really like tackling each other and we always looked out for each other. He's still my little brother so I don't think I'd be able to hit him with one of my Conference-style tackles! 'I think he's more excited about the prospect of playing me than I am about playing him but we've still got that brotherly competition. If I came up against Kieran then I'd just have to treat it like facing any other opponent. 'For that 90 minutes we wouldn't be family, just players on opposing teams. I'm sure he'd be the same.' The Gibbs duo are all smiles as they strike a pose in matching Superman outfits as children . Jaydon admits his Mum would prefer her two sons to avoid playing each other in the third round of the FA Cup . Jaydon and Kieran pose with their Mum during a trip to Portugal over the summer . But who would come out on top? 'That's a dangerous question! I wouldn't mind a little running race with him at the moment. I'm the fittest I've ever been so it would probably be pretty close.' Originally an attack-minded winger, Jaydon dropped into defence at the start of the previous campaign and has made the position his own with a little help from his younger sibling. 'Last season our right back got injured and I saw that there were only attacking players on the bench,' he recalls. 'I put my hand up and told the manager that I could do a job there and 52 games later I haven't moved. 'I just try and watch his (Kieran's) games and learn from the way he does things. The Premier League is hugely different to the Conference - they get so much time on the ball. I ask for pointers and just try to take as much on board as I can. 'Kieran has been to watch me play more times this season than I've watched him. He loves it down here and he has come out with the boys at the weekend too. He really watches the games and tells me a lot when he get home.' Jaydon beats Portsmouth's Miles Storey during the Vanarama Conference club's first round victory . Jaydon admits he was a bit more naughty at school while twin brother Kieran was more reserved . Jaydon enjoys a BBQ day with brother Kieran's Arsenal and England team-mate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Home for the Gibbs brothers is a house, or as Jaydon describes it 'a bachelor pad', in north London. They've lived together since moving out of their family home at the age of 19 and now spend much of their free time together, although that wasn't always the case. 'We didn't even walk to school together when we were younger!' he reveals with a laugh. 'I was a bit more naughty at school and he was more reserved. We didn't always see eye-to-eye but we had the same mates. It wasn't until we got a bit older that we became closer. 'I think he was a bit nervous as he came through at Arsenal and he didn't really have anyone to confide in. That's where I came in and we've been inseparable ever since. 'We both get in from training in the afternoon. I make dinner and he does the washing up. We watch TV, play FIFA and pool - typical brother stuff. We've got mates round all the time, too.' Kieran often shuns the limelight which comes with being a top-flight footballer but Jaydon freely admits that things might be very different if he'd been the one to graduate from Arsenal's academy and into the public's consciousness. Kieran is now the first-choice left back at Arsenal and is pictured here taking on West Brom this season . The pair live together in north London - Jaydon does the cooking and enjoys chilling out with his brother . 'I think this interview would be very different!' he jokes. 'The fame went to the right one of us. Kieran is a model professional and I'm not just saying that because he is my brother. 'He's a role model for anyone wanting to become a footballer. I'd probably be on the front page of the paper rather than the back!' He did make headlines back in May, 2012, when he unwittingly played international football for the Principality of Sealand, an unrecognised self-declared state located on a British-built platform in the North Sea. 'I didn't know what it was all about,' he says, the surprise still evident in his voice. 'My brother's agent asked me if I'd like to be involved and I thought it was a charity game. 'I thought it was weird when they played the national anthems at the start and afterwards someone told me I'd earned international honours! It's a bit of a shame as it might have ruined by England hopes. Jaydon, pictured with Kieran dressed as waiters, insists his brother is the perfect role model . Jaydon revealed his brother Kieran has seen him play more times this season than he's watched Arsenal . Whilst Kieran has lifted the FA Cup, success for Jaydon would be to reach the third round of the competition . 'Actor Ralf Little and someone from the band McFly played too. I couldn't believe it. I don't really shout about it but it's on my CV.' While playing for Sealand was just a bit of fun, Jaydon is now completely concentrated on the game he once walked away from. Playing at the highest level possible is his aim, with a return to the Football League with Aldershot a realistic goal. ‘I'm not getting any younger now and if I'm going to get back into the league then it's going to have to be soon,’ he says. ‘It'd be great to do it with Aldershot, we've got a great set-up here.' This weekend his focus is on the FA Cup, a competition his brother won with Arsenal just six-and-a-half months ago. Success for Jaydon and his team-mates would simply be reaching the third round.

"The man with the dog tattoo tends to do things a little differently, which is probably why Bournemouth won’t roll over when Liverpool come to town this month. ‘It’s for Rodney,’ says Eddie Howe. One of the most upwardly mobile English managers is referring to the letter R inked on his right wrist. ‘It’s the only tattoo I have. He was the Labrador I had here when I moved away from home to be an apprentice. Some people don’t understand it.’ Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe is enjoying a very successful second spell as Cherries boss . Howe congratulates the Bournemouth squad after knocking West Brom out of the Capital One Cup in October . He laughs, but there are many things about this 37-year-old, who has taken charge of more than 300 games, that are not entirely conventional. There are the text-message rituals he shares with the club’s Russian owner and the £3,000 he once took from his own pocket to get his players into shape. There’s also his answer to the question of whether he would leave if a Premier League club approached him before the end of the season. The 37-year-old, bellowing out instructions on the touchline, is passionate about the job at Bournemouth . ‘I genuinely wouldn’t,’ he says. ‘I’m in a good place, with freedom and control and support from the owner. I have learnt that when you are in management there should be no rush — it’s easy to go wrong. ‘So long as we are progressing and I can work in these conditions, I have no desire to go anywhere.’ The truth is that Bournemouth and Howe are a good mixture. Bournemouth's Eunan O'Kane celebrates scoring against West Brom in the Capital One Cup . It’s the club that nurtured him and whom he served for more than 300 games across two spells as a player, the second of which came after fans pledged £13,500 online to help buy him. As a manager, either side of a stint at Burnley, he took the financially-crippled club from the foot of League Two in 2008 to fourth in the Championship today. They have done it playing passing, attacking football. More still, they host Liverpool on December 17 in the quarter-final of the Capital One Cup, pitting Howe against Brendan Rodgers, the man he credits for so much of his education. Howe played for Bournemouth during two spells, appearing over 300 times for the south coast side . ‘If my memory is right, we first met when Swansea played Burnley way back in the Championship in 2011,’ Howe says. ‘We were fortunate because we beat Swansea but I was really impressed by him — not just his passion but the way his team played. ‘I rang him at some point after that and said, “Do you mind if I come in and watch you work?” ‘It might sound strange, coming from one Championship manager to another. I’ve only asked a few times about things like that and Brendan was the only one who opened the door. ‘They got promoted to the Premier League and that’s when I went in.’ He met Rodgers at the public health club where Swansea used to train. Howe adds: ‘He had this tiny office. I took a lot from that meeting — the facilities weren’t what I was expecting. It proved the quality of the coaching is the most important thing. Howe spent a day learning with Brendan Rodgers during the Liverpool manager's time as Swansea boss . ‘He spent the whole day with me, sharing his views on life and football. What he said really stuck with me. He couldn’t emphasise enough how important it is to educate yourself as much as you can and his sessions were brilliant. ‘I learnt as much from that one day as I did from a huge time in management. ‘I will always be grateful to him and respect him for that. And if he wants to loan me Raheem Sterling or Daniel Sturridge, that would be nice, too.’ These are good times for Howe, who admits: ‘The thought of a cup quarter-final and contending to get in the Premier League is strange — I’ve been here a very long time and I know where we came from.’ Howe was a fans’ favourite as a defender for the club, having joined at 10 and risen through the age groups. ‘I did pre-season under Tony Pulis and that was brutal,’ he says. Howe’s peak came when he won two England Under 21 caps at the Toulon Tournament in 1998. ‘I was the unknown guy from Bournemouth,’ he says. ‘There was Frank Lampard, Jamie Carragher, Emile Heskey — they were all Premier League. When I joined Portsmouth in 2002, I worked under Harry Redknapp. He really knows how to build a team.’ Howe was Redknapp’s first signing at Portsmouth, given his big chance in the Championship, but he badly injured his knee on his debut and from there it was tough. Bournemouth fans celebrate after securing their promotion to the Championship back in May 2013 . He returned to Bournemouth in 2004 but the knee ultimately meant his retirement in 2007, aged 29. After some time coaching at the club, his phone rang on New Year’s Eve, 2008. They had started the season with a 17-point deduction and Jimmy Quinn was sacked with the club deep in the relegation zone and broke. ‘I was at a party,’ Howe says. ‘I remember getting a phone call and going to the garden trying to get a signal. I was offered the job and the world sort of stopped spinning for me. I said yes instantly but I was asking myself, “What are you doing?” ‘I don’t think I would have ever had the opportunity elsewhere. My only chance was here, where I had this connection. But in your head you know if you are not successful in that first job you are on the scrapheap at 31. I was really worried about letting people down.’ The Football League’s youngest manager kept them in League Two, got promotion the next season and, after a 19-month stint at Championship club Burnley, returned following the unexpected death of his mother in October 2012. He landed his second promotion that season. ‘There was simply no money when I first joined in 2009,’ Howe says. ‘We were literally 15 minutes from going out of business. Bailiffs were turning up, players weren’t getting paid. The Cherries boss is a hero at Dean Court, with a Bournemouth fan using a Howe mask to celebrate . ‘I remember before we went up from League Two, I wanted a sport scientist for pre-season. ‘Jason (Tindall, his assistant) and I paid £3,000 for that from our own pockets. I didn’t tell my family.’ These days, under Russian millionaire Maxim Demin, motivational quotes from Abraham Lincoln to Michael Jordan line the stadium walls and finances are considerably healthier, even though Howe gets ‘quite annoyed’ when people say they have bought success in his second stint. He adds: ‘You need money to reach this level and the owner has been great. But our wage bill is probably mid-Championship and our back four is the same as when we were bottom three in League One.’ Howe, celebrating during his playing days for Bournemouth, is also enjoying success as their manager . Today, they are top four in the Championship with the superstitious leaders of the club growing more twitchy. Demin apparently opted against attending the win over West Brom in the Cup fourth round because he did not wish to ‘jinx’ the side, and Howe does not know if he will attend the game against Liverpool. ‘We have a few quite superstitious people here, myself included,’ Howe says. ‘I get to the ground at 10am before every home game and I have my way of setting certain things up. ‘Max and I also text each other about an hour and a half before a game. A few of the board have superstitions as well. It’s one of those things about professional sport — you learn to value luck.’ You would imagine Bournemouth have learned the value of a New Year’s Eve phone call, too.","37-year-old has led a remarkable transformation of the south coast club .

"Paul Merson launched a scathing attack on Arsenal after they threw away a three goal lead to draw 3-3 with Anderlecht in the Champions League. Speaking on Sky Sports after the match, the former Gunners midfielder slammed the team's overly-offensive tactics as Arsene Wenger's side squandered a three-goal lead. On eleven separate occasions he slammed the current side as 'tactically clueless' and berated the mental weakness of the Gunners players. Here, Sportsmail's Rob Draper analyses where it's going wrong for Arsenal. Arsenal squandered a three goal lead against Anderlect to draw in the Champions League on Tuesday . Anderlecht players celebrate what seemed like an unlikely draw with their fans at full-time at the Emirates . Pundit Paul Merson, who played for Arsenal in the nineties, was incensed at his former side's capitulation . Merson spent twelve years at Highbury and made nearly 300 league appearances for the north London club . THE CONUNDRUM . He can do it. Check the date and note the venue: 21st May, 2005, The Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. Arsene Wenger spent the years running up to that FA Cup final saying that he would never abandon his attacking instincts and his beloved 4-4-2 system. And yet that day in Cardiff he did. So confused were observers that it took time to work out Arsenal’s formation: yes, he really was playing 4-5-1 with Dennis Bergkamp as a lone striker – and even he was dropping deep to help out. Arsenal's current midfield lacks the steel and prowess of players like Patrick Vieira (left) and Emmanuel Petit . Arsenal won the FA Cup in 2005 after manager Arsene Wenger opted for a 4-5-1 formation over the usual 4-4-2 . That day Arsenal had Philippe Senderos at centre back facing a United attack of Wayne Rooney and Ruud van Nistelrooy with Cristiano Ronaldo on the wing and Paul Scholes and Roy Keane in midfield. And yet they did it; with Thierry Henry injured and with a much weaker team than Manchester United, they eked out their draw and won on penalties. Likewise, a year later in 2006 in the Champions League final against Barcelona: down to ten men after the sending off of Jens Lehmann, Arsenal defended manfully for 76 minutes, holding on to a 1-0 lead and only succumbing in that final quarter of an hour. So if Wenger could do it then, why can’t Arsenal do it now? And, against Anderlecht, of all teams; not exactly Manchester United or Barcelona. Arsenal centre back Phillipe Senderos played in the final and kept out the likes of Wayne Rooney (pictured) Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off in the 2006 Champions League final and held onto a lead until late on . THE CENTRAL PROBLEM? IT'S THE MIDFIELD, STUPID... The back four have naturally been the focus of the capitulation on Tuesday night and rightly so in one respect. But while it is true that Arsenal’s defence had an awful night against Anderlecht, the warning signs had been clear in the opening twenty minutes when Dennis Praet had acres of space in which to operate in front of the defence. There is rarely any protection given to Arsenal defenders. Maybe Wenger believes that is the way the modern game has evolved but few seem to share his belief; and it is not what he once believed. When he was consistently winning trophies, Arsenal were a more pragmatic team than they have been in the last nine years, when one trophy has been gleaned. Now it is all about accumulating dainty, skilful midfield player, who are glorious to watch; back in 1996, among his first recruits for the club were Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit, strong midfielders, with height and power. After Petit, there was Gilberto Silva, And that Cup final in 2005 was Vieira’s last game, after which the trophies dried up. Those midfielders could get forward and contribute to attack but they had a basic defensive mind-set and a protective instinct; neither Mikel Arteta, nor Aaron Ramsey nor Jack Wilshere has that; Mathieu Flamini does, but with neither the athleticism nor the technical ability of his predecessors. Anderlecht's Dennis Praet, pictured against Alexis Sanchez, had space to operate in front of the defence . Midfield duo Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit celebrate Arsenal's Premier League title win in 1998 . Mathieu Flamini (left) has a defensive mind-set but lacks the technical ability of his predecessors . THE DEFENCE? THERE IS NO DEFENCE, BUT... That said, the back four is clearly weak and insufficient for the task of winning a Premier League title or the Champions League, which brings us back to a familiar refrain at Arsenal about the lack of recruitment. Wenger himself predicted before the season began that Per Mertesacker would experience a dip in form after winning the World Cup, as Vieira and Petit did in 1998. So why, when Thomas Vermaelen was sold, was there no replacement signed? Calum Chambers may well be a centre half in the future, but at 19 years old, clearly wasn’t ready to be a regular in that position. He is raw and potential to be excellent but is often exposed in his more natural position at right back, Likewise, Nacho Monreal doesn’t always convince at left back, so being asked to play centre half is a big ask. Wenger’s retort would be that it is tough to recruit a third-choice centre half: a world class defender won’t accept that and anything else would be sub-standard. But that is rather like fisherman complaining about the sea. It’s just part of the job. Entering a season with two recognised senior centre halves was clearly a risk too far; it doesn’t need the clarity of hindsight to say so; plenty said it in August. Per Mertesacker has experienced a dip in form while Calum Chambers lacks experience at centre back . THE PHILOSOPHY . The 2005 FA Cup final should be Arsene Wenger’s reference point. It isn’t of course but it should be. Wenger is coy his footballing inspirations but from outside it always seems as though Johan Cruyff’s attack-minded football is his blueprint, though there has always been a healthy regard for Arrigo Sacchi’s AC Milan, which is why 4-4-2 was once his mantra. Clearly he will always be an attacking coach and we should applaud him for that. But so wide are the gaps in Arsenal’s midfield at times - successive games at Stamford Bridge over the past ten years come to mind, last season’s 6-0 simply being the worst – it seems been blinded by his own beliefs, like a political leader wedded to an misguided ideology. The more Wenger’s teams struggle, the more determined he is to win something without physical defensive players, as if to prove a point. But that wasn’t how he established his name as a manger, not at Arsenal, nor at Monaco, where midfielders Marcel Dib and Jean Philippe Rohr were his engine room. The more Wenger’s teams struggle, the more determined he is to win without physical players it seems . Perhaps there is hope. Arsenal are in the market for a strong, mobile athletic defensive midfielder. In fact it is their No.1 priority, more so than a centre half. William Carvalho at Sporting looks to be the prototype - he defends and he is huge - but Arsenal don’t believe he is mobile enough so is unlikely to be the answer. Anyway his links to Jorge Mendes, Jose Mourinho’s agent, means Arsenal would struggle to sign him. It is noticeable that Mendes players hardly ever go to Arsenal. What is clear is that he is the type of players that is required. If Wenger cannot rediscover his roots, the Anderlecht debacle – which can be added to the calamities at Anfield and Stamford Bridge from last season – will repeat. But if he could remodel a side based on axis like Vieira and Petit, imagine what his team could achieve? William Carvalho is a huge defensive midfielder but Arsenal don't believe he is mobile enough .","Arsenal squandered three-goal lead to draw with Anderlecht at home .

"Dressed in casual T-shirts with their arms around each other, the men posing for photographs could be documenting a visit to any tourist attraction in the world. But these Turkish daytrippers aren't admiring a famous painting or well-known monument  - they are taking pictures of U.S. airstrikes against brutal Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Kobane. With explosions taking place behind them in a city where ISIS have butchered hundreds of Kurds over the last few weeks, the carefree men seem more interested in documenting the moment on digital cameras and mobile phones than coming to terms with the horrific reality of the situation. Scroll down for video . Capturing the moment: Men standing on the Turkish side of the border take photographs as U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS militants take place behind them in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane . Spectators: Turkish men watch as an airstrike destroys a building in Kobane thought to have been held by ISIS . Looking on: Men in the Suruc district of Sanliurfa in Turkey watch as Islamic State militants in neighbouring Kobane, Syria are targeted by U.S. led airstrikes . Kobane is located so close to the Syrian border with Turkey that its northern streets actually run parallel to the barbed wire fence that separates the two countries. As street fighting rages in the city - which has a population of 400,000 - some missiles fired by ISIS militants have even crossed over the border and damaged homes belonging to Turkish families. The fighting has led to a column of Turkish tanks patrolling the area around the largely porous border to protect against any threat posed the Islamists . Meanwhile U.S. airstrikes hit ISIS targets in the Kobane suburbs this morning in the hope of halting an advance that led to the chilling sight of a black jihadist flag being raised over a building in the east of the city yesterday. This afternoon Turkish president Recep Erdogan said the fall of Kobane to the terrorists was imminent, despite promising he wouldn't allow such an event to happen only days ago. While all this rumbles on, crowds of onlookers have gathered on the Turkish side of the border to watch the bloody spectacle - making sure to capture every explosion on their smart phones. Document: A Turkish man takes a photograph as smoke rises from an building across the border in Kobane . Close quarters: Kobane is located so close to the Syrian border with Turkey that its northern streets actually run parallel to the small fence that separates the two countries . Blast: Crowds of onlookers have gathered on the Turkish side of the border to watch the fighting in Kobane- making sure to capture every explosion on their smart phones . The Islamic State is about to capture the Syrian border town of Kobane, Turkey's president said today, as outgunned Kurdish forces struggled to repel the extremists with limited aid from U.S.-led coalition airstrikes. ISIS fighters using tanks and heavy weapons looted from captured army bases in Iraq and Syria have been pounding Kurdish forces in the strategic town for days. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the coalition air campaign launched last month would not be enough to halt the Islamic State advance and called for greater cooperation with the Syrian opposition, which is fighting both ISIS and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad. Turkish tanks and other ground forces have been stationed along the border within a few hundred meters of the fighting in Kobane - also known as Ayn Arab - but have not intervened. Crowds of onlookers have gathered in the hills around the Turkish village of Mursitpinar, where just a few miles to the south Kurdish fighters are battling against militants from the Islamic State. From their relatively safe haven the people have been able to take photographs of the increasingly intense fighting in Kobane over the past few weeks, as ISIS creep ever closer to the city centre. This morning, almost as if they were watching a fireworks display, the spectators took photographs of explosion after explosion as warplanes from the U.S. Air Force hammered terrorist targets in the east and south west of the city. They are not alone in their fascination with watching a conflict unfold; just weeks ago a fierce three-way battle between Syrian government forces, Al Qaeda-linked rebels and fighters from the Islamic State drew large crowds in neighbouring Israel. Residents in Golan Heights took took to the mountains in T-shirts, shorts and sunglasses to watch a bloody battle unfold in the town of Quneitra, across the Syrian border beneath them. Ghoulish: Last month residents in Golan Heights took took to the mountains in T-shirts, shorts and sunglasses to watch a bloody battle unfold in the town of Quneitra, across the Syrian border beneath them . Sightseeing: Overlooking orchards spilling down the mountainside, the platform was the perfect spot for the tourists watch the battle near Quneitra crossing in early September . Rebel tank: Residents in Golan Heights nonchalantly watch the fighting in the Syrian town of Quneitra . War tourism has a long history, dating back millennia when accounts of great battles would be written and told by individuals who claim to have witnessed them first hand. By the 1600s Dutch painter Willem van de Velde was travelling on war ships in order to sketch fighting with English vessels - while the battles of Waterloo and Gettysburg in the 1800s both had spectators who had journeyed deliberately to the conflict zone in order to watch events unfold. In the 1860s Thomas Cook organised holidays for British tourists on American Civil War battlefields, and similar guided tours were organised available for those interested in locations associated with the Crimean War. In fact during the Battle of Alma in 1854 - considered the first battle of the Crimean War - Prince Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov is said to have invited women from the nearby town of Sevastopol to take up positions on a nearby mountainside to watch his men fight. Turkey has demanded the U.S. carry out military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad a a condition for further Turkish support in fighting against Islamic State militants. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that a no-fly zone must immediately be put in place over Syria to protect the Turkish border from both the threat of attack, as well as millions of Syrian refugees who have poured into the country during three years of intense fighting. In order to put a no-fly zone in place, however, the U.S. would need to conduct targeted strikes on Assad's air defences, as well as provide additional support for millions of potential refugees. 'We want to have a no-fly zone, we want to have a safe have on our border,' Mr Davutoglu told CNN News. Turkey is reluctant to assist Kurdish fighters because they are affiliated with the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - a group recently described as 'the same as ISIS' by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (pictured) 'Otherwise all these burdens will continue to go on the shoulder of Turkey and other neighbouring countries,' he said, referring to the refugee crisis. 'We are ready to do everything if there is a clear strategy that, after ISIS, we can be sure our border is protected,' Mr Davutoglu went on to say. Turkey has been criticised for an apparent lack of effort in targeting ISIS in neighbouring Syria and Iraq, although talks will take place next week to discuss the country's contribution to the U.S./Arab coalition currently carrying out airstrikes on the terror group. Turkey has been reluctant to assist Syrian Kurdish fighters battling against ISIS because they are affiliated with the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - a group recently described as 'the same as ISIS' by Turkish President  Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey has also been accused of 'doing deals' with ISIS, agreeing to allow up to 180 detained militants - including British-born jihadists - to rejoin the group, in return for the release of 46 Turkish citizens and three local Iraqi staff captured in the city of Mosul five months ago.","Turkish men pose for photographs overlooking besieged Syrian city Kobane .

"'Football was a boat taking him away from Madeira' are the rather florid words - particularly for a football agent, you might suggest? - chosen to describe the incredible journey of an equally amazing footballer, Cristiano Ronaldo. Poetic licence aside, there also happens to be an element of truth in them. Because as new Sky Sports documentary, 'The Making of Ronaldo' (timed to pre-empt their coverage of the 2014 Ballon d'Or ceremony) tells us, it was the dogged determination of this small-island boy to leave behind his home and his family and chase his football dream, that turned him into the global superstar we know today. As we discover in this thorough examination of Ronaldo's formative years, he was never just a child prodigy simply waiting for his destiny to fulfil itself. Meticulously researched and delivered by celebrated Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague, 'The Making of Ronaldo' makes it perfectly clear that the young man was personally responsible for making his own good luck. Or as one of his first coaches at the Madeira club Nacional puts it, 'only 20 or 30 per cent was natural ability'. A documentary about Cristiano Ronaldo's rise, 'The Making of Ronaldo', aired on Sky Sports on Sunday . A young Ronaldo is photographed while in his accommodation during his time at Sporting Lisbon . The Portuguese winger celebrates scoring a goal for Real Madrid in 2012 . And the reigning Ballon d'Or holder celebrates scoring for Sporting's youth side . Ronaldo also dazzled Old Trafford crowds earlier in his career while at Manchester United . Yet he was also 'the star and leader'. This desire to turn himself into something more special than anybody else is underlined all the way through the programme. Early on, his childhood friend Ricard Santos is filmed on the distinctly poor street where they played football, and the young Cristiano began to live his dream. 'You could only play short passes', he pointed out from a cramped concrete strip they called a pitch. 'But he could beat players the length of it.' From here on in, we hear from a succession of men, all of who had a hand, in some way, in his future, and all of who again underline the unique commitment he displayed. Not least of which when, at the tender age of 11, he left his family behind on Madeira to make the big leap and join Sporting Lisbon's academy. Here, we discover, he was around three or four years younger than his fellow football students. But it didn't take long for then head coach Luis Lorenco to commit to keeping him at the club. He tells the tale of how on the second day of his week-long trial, Lorenco was told by his fellow coaches to check this eleven-year-old out. Ronaldo holds aloft the Ballon d'Or trophy, which he claimed last January and hopes to retain . Former Sporting director of football Carlos Freitas says Ronaldo told him he would be the best in the world . Ronaldo moved to Nacional in 1995 before heading to Sporting in 1997 . The winger takes a shot for Sporting Lisbon, a club he spent five years at before leaving for Old Trafford . Ronaldo moved to Nacional, a club on the island of Madeira, in order to further his footballing education . He then explains that, at a throw in, Ronaldo turned to a boy at least three years his senior who was marking him a little too tightly, and said 'hey kid, calm down'. It was, says Lorenco, the moment Cristiano was in. But he was still only a child and this separation from heart and home was proving the ruination of even older boys than him. 'The toughest days are birthdays' one dad tells us of his own son's absence to further his football life. While former English football favourite Luis Boa Morte, now a coach at Sporting, also points out that some boys can 'get lost' in the big city, before adding 'it's cruel to have to choose at 12 or 13, but it's how you get your start'. This wasn't lost on young Ronaldo and in spite of some homesickness and occasional waywardness, he continued with his quest to be better than the rest. Ronaldo (right) took himself away from his comfort zone in order to develop as a footballer . During training Ronaldo (left) has water poured over him by a Sporting team-mate . Ronaldo was football mad from a very young age and he started at Andorinha before moving to Nacional . 'I will be the best footballer in the world,' Sporting's Sporting Director Carlos Freitas tells us he told him. And Freitas had no reason to disagree. Especially when for instance, as he points out, 'the security people would have to close the doors, and turn the lights out in the gym' to prevent him taking the extra sessions he thought would help set him apart from the rest. 'The Making of Ronaldo' contains a wealth of first-hand testimony from those that were part of the story... as well as a few interesting glimpses at the places the kid stopped off at along the way. However, it does rather lack a physical presence to walk us through the story - Guillem is more often than not, unseen and unheard - and as such it does feel rather like an extended news report. Nevertheless, such is the strength of the journalism, you are never in doubt that what we're hearing is the inside track on the promising young boy who became a footballing Galactico. And if - as we see him doing in the last picture of the documentary - Ronaldo once again lifts football's golden globe aloft, 'The Making of Ronaldo' will have gone a long way as to reminding us why.

"Sunderland boss Gus Poyet looks set to make a renewed move for Liverpool’s Fabio Borini in January. In what was one of the ‘Will he? Won’t he?’ transfer sagas of the summer, the Italian kept the Black Cats waiting until the final week of the window before telling them he intended to stay with the Anfield club, who had accepted a £14million bid for the striker. Borini had enjoyed a season-long loan spell at the Stadium of Light, and Poyet remains an admirer. Fabio Borini has only started once in the Premier League for Liverpool this season after deciding not to join Sunderland on a permanent deal in the summer . Borini was on loan at the Stadium of Light last season and Liverpool accepted a £14m bid from the Black Cats . Sunderland travel to Liverpool on Saturday and Poyet is hoping that a good reception from the travelling fans could let Borini know he is still appreciated on Wearside. ‘I hope our fans will give him a terrific reception,’ said the Uruguayan. ‘I would like them to because he deserves it. He is one of those players who, for some reason, everyone thought would be here so we never really wanted to say goodbye to him. But he is not here so it is a good opportunity for us to say thank you to Fabio.’ Borini scored 10 times for Sunderland last season and, without his guile, they have failed to net in seven of their 14 league matches this term. The striker, who opted to stay and fight for his place at Anfield, netted 10 times for Sunderland . Gus Poyet admits that his side have missed the Italian striker's goals this term . Poyet admits he has been a miss. ‘Goals are very expensive so we have missed him a lot,’ he added. ‘I think we are learning now but the higher you go there are some players when you know them well they become a little bit more expensive. When you know a player and you know what you are going to get in any division it makes a difference.’ Borini has appeared eight times for the Reds this season, starting only once in the Premier League, and Poyet says he would have perhaps been better placed under his care. ‘In terms of quantity of games he probably did not make the right decision,’ he said. ‘In terms of quality probably yes, because he has played in the Champions League.’","Fabio Borini spent last season on loan at Sunderland and scored 10 times .

"Raheem Sterling was too tired to start in England's 1-0 win over Estonia - and now it seems his burnout extends to having to get a lift to training. Liverpool and England team-mate Jordan Henderson drove Sterling home after a session at their Melwood training base ahead of Sunday's trip to the 19-year-old's former club QPR. Sportsmail understands the England midfield pair joined Steven Gerrard, Mario Balotelli, Glen Johnson and Jose Enrique in a stripped-down training session with the likes of Joe Allen and Simon Mignolet still away on international duty.

Roy Hodgson left Sterling out of the starting line-up for England's 1-0 win over Estonia in Euro 2016 qualifying on Sunday after the young playmaker complained of feeling tired. Sterling has become a key player for club and country this season and his increased time on the field appears to be taking its toll on the Liverpool star. Hodgson is expected to hold talks with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers this week regarding their shared use of Sterling - and he could be left out of the trip to QPR on Sunday if deemed too tired again. Sterling views criticism of him for complaining of tiredness as unfair after a difficult start to the new campaign - and appeared to speak out on Twitter against his detractors. After coming off the bench in Tallinn, Sterling was fouled for the free-kick that led to Wayne Rooney's second-half winner that secured a perfect start to England's qualifying group with three wins from three games.

"Paul Merson has launched a scathing attack on Arsenal after they threw away a three goal lead to draw 3-3 with Anderlecht in the Champions League. Speaking on Sky Sports after the match, former Arsenal midfielder Merson did not hold back in his analysis, slamming the team's overly-offensive tactics at 3-0 up.

How you can be 3-0 up and be attacking? This is not the first time it's happened, this happens a lot of times. It's absolutely clueless. 'The manager has got to get a message on. You're playing with international footballers. These are not little kids, they've played in World Cups, a lot of Premier League games. 'They're all bombing forward. Surely something in your head, if you know football, you say, ""Right, lets stop here, lets have two banks of four, two up front, and we'll go from there. Let them break us down.""

'He's been a massive part of my career since I've been at Arsenal and a big inspiration for me as my mentor, so to see him injured for as long as he was upsetting and disappointing.

"Two longtime UPS employees killed by a 'troubled' former colleague in a shooting at a package-processing facility in Alabama were supervisors who had worked for the shipping giant for years, the company said Wednesday. Business manager Brian Callans, 46, of Birmingham, and driver supervisor Doug Hutcheson, 33, of Odenville, have been identified as the men killed on Tuesday in what appears to be a targeted attack by co-worker Kerry Joe Tesney, 45, who was fired one day earlier. Callans, who had worked for the shipping giant for 26 years, was engaged to be married and also worked nights as a bartender at a popular downtown dance club. Hutcheson, a UPS employee since 1999, was married and had two children. Callans wasn't supposed to be at work the day of the shooting because of vacation but recently received a promotion and stopped by to make sure things were OK for the employee taking his place, said friend Leesa Warren. Gunned down: Longtime United Parcel Service workers Brian Callans , 46 (left), and Doug Hutcheson, 33 (right), have been identified as the two men shot dead in Birmingham, Alabama, on Tuesday by a former colleague . Shooter: Kerry Joe Tesney, 45, a married father-of-two, was fired from UPS on Monday, but returned to the warehouse where he worked on Tuesday and killed two former co-workers, before shooting himself. He is pictured here with his two daughters . Scene: Police say Joe Tesney, 45, opened fire Tuesday morning inside one of the company's warehouses in Birmingham, Alabama, killing two of his supervisors, before taking his own life . On guard: Law-enforcement converge on a home in the Argo area in connection with the investigation into shooting at the UPS service center at Inglenook community on September 23, 2014 in Birmingham, Alabama . 'He was that type of guy. He never left anything undone,' said Warren, who owns the Bacchus dance club where Callans served drinks. Tesney, a driver, had been with UPS for 21 years but had been fired recently, said the statement. AL.com reported that Callans recommended Tesney be fired after 'uncovering some wrongdoing'. The website also reported Tesney had been fired numerous times before but had gotten his job back. Authorities said Tesney entered his former workplace and began shooting, killing the two supervisors before taking his own life. Callans and Hutcheson were believed to be inside Callans office at the time of the attack. Police said Tesney was fired Monday but walked into the warhouse wearing his uniform on Tuesday. The company said the man apparently evaded security by entering through a truck bay that normally isn't used by pedestrians at the rear of the building. The death toll may have been worse if 80 or so drivers had not already departed, officials said. 'It was a relatively small crew that was remaining,' said Steve Gaut, a spokesman for the shipping company. 'Troubled': Kerry Joe Tesney, pictured here with his wife Melissa, had been noticeably unsettled of late and had prayed about, his pastor said . Enagaged: Brian Callans, a 26-year employee at UPS, was set to marry his fiancee . Murdered: Doug Hutcheson, 33, who joined UPS in 1999 shortly after graduating high school, was married and had twin four-year-old sons . Tesney's pastor, Bill Wilks of NorthPark Baptist Church in Trussville, said the man had been troubled over his work and financial situation. 'In his own spirit he's been troubled, and he's asked for prayer about that,' Wilkins said. Officials haven't said what prompted Tesney's dismissal or might have generated workplace tension. But documents in a court case show Callans was involved in a dispute over a missing radiator after an automotive company sued UPS and Tesney alleging Tesney wrongly took the part while making a package pickup in 2010. HESCO Inc. filed suit in 2010 claiming Tesney had wrongly picked up a $4,000 radiator for shipment either intentionally or by mistake. The lawsuit went on for three years before a judge ruled in favor of Tesney and the shipping company on September 23, 2013, exactly a year before the shooting. A brief filed by HESCO said Tesney gave differing accounts of what happened to the radiator. Tesney told the owner of the company he took it by accident, but Tesney told a manager that he had used it as a 'tray' to carry items to his truck. Shooting rampage: Police stormed a UPS warehouse in Birmingham, Alabama, on Tuesday after a gunman shot dead two workers before killing himself . Scene: The incident occurred at the UPS Customer Care Center in the 4600 block of Inglenook Lane in Birmingham . Disbelief: The family of Kerry Joe Tesney have expressed shock over the shooting, describing him as a lovely man . Deadly: Investigators are looking into the firing of Kerry Joe Tesney from UPS as motivation for his killing spree . Callans — whose last name was spelled 'Callens' in the court document — 'accepted responsibility for the missing radiator', said the document. HESCO attorney Jud Stanford declined comment. It wasn't immediately clear whether the lawsuit played any role in Tesney's firing. Tesney and his wife Melissa have two children. The family has been active members of the church since 2003, Wilks said. Aside from the job with the shipping giant, Tesney and his wife, Melissa, are listed as distributors for Advocare, a multi-level marketing company that sells health and fitness products. They have a website advertising the business that says: 'Just tell us your needs, your dreams your desires ... and we'll make it happen!'","UPS truck driver Kerry Joe Tesney, 45, was officially fired from his post at a package processing facility in Birmingham, Alabama, on Monday .

"They even stole my underpants,’ says Victor Wanyama, shaking his head. He is discussing the recent burglary at his Winchester home. ‘There are some strange people around,’ he says. ‘They took everything. My car, jewellery, three televisions, clothes, shoes. ‘I had champagne bottles in cases which were my man-of-the-match awards. They left the glass case and took the champagne. My car was found the next day but the most important things were my shirts, one from Andres Iniesta and the other from Paul Pogba. They are still missing.’ Understandably, the events have left Wanyama feeling uneasy. He is not the only Southampton player to be affected. Jose Fonte, Nathaniel Clyne and Emmanuel Mayuka have all fallen victim to break-ins. Victor Wanyama (right) believes Southampton are good enough to qualify for the Champions League . The 23-year-old (right) has had to move into a hotel after his Winchester home was recently burgled . YAYA TOURE: Yaya has everything. He has power, strength, physique but he also has a velvet touch on the ball. He can make a terrific pass. ALEXIS SANCHEZ: Alexis dances like a snake, the way he moves. You have to be careful timing your tackles, it’s difficult to get the ball. SERGIO AGUERO: I like the look of Diego Costa at Chelsea, the way he roughs up defenders, but Aguero is strong and a deadly finisher. The Kenyan has moved temporarily to a nearby hotel while his house is fitted with new alarms. ‘I need somewhere to feel safe and relaxed to concentrate on my game. Home doesn’t feel like home right now.’ The 23-year-old is polite and softly spoken. He is frustrated though following the previous night’s defeat at Arsenal. It has been a tough week, the 1-0 loss at The Emirates followed a 3-0 defeat by Manchester City and Monday brings another acid test of their top-four credentials when they host Manchester United, the club Wanyama supported as a boy. ‘We feel we deserve to be where we are,’ says Wanyama on Southampton’s lofty league position. ‘The squad is stronger than last season. Our losses have come down to individual errors and not being clinical with our chances. That’s the difference with the top sides. ‘City are the champions but they set out to defend against us because they know we keep possession well but they were deadly with their chances. At Arsenal we were unlucky, they have a magician in Alexis Sanchez and we were down to 10 men at a crucial time. ‘We deserve to be where we are. We have a few injuries too but we know we have to keep working to stay in the top four.’ Despite off-field problems, Wanyama (below) has played a key role in Southampton's great start to the season . Wanyama (right) scored in Celtic's famous 2-1 Champions League win against Barcelona in November 2012 . 1) YAYA TOURE . Yaya has everything. He has power, strength, physique but he also has a velvet touch on the ball. He can make a terrific pass. 2) ALEXIS SANCHEZ . Alexis dances like a snake, the way he moves. You have to be careful timing your tackles, it’s difficult to get the ball. 3) SERGIO AGUERO . I like the look of Diego Costa at Chelsea, the way he roughs up defenders, but Aguero is strong and a deadly finisher. Wanyama has already starred in the Champions League at Celtic. His performances, including a goal in their famous 2-1 win over Barcelona in November 2012, helped earn his £12.5million move to Southampton 18 months ago. The younger Southampton players quiz him about what it was like. ‘James Ward-Prowse and Jack Cork ask me about the games,’ he says. ‘Barcelona was the highlight of my career so far. I tell them how fantastic it was and how great the atmosphere was. It is the best club competition in the world. ‘It means so much to players. Some Barcelona players like Xavi and Iniesta came to me and said “well played” but Dani Alves was screaming how we had only defended and cheated them and Jordi Alba was in tears.’ Beating a resurgent Manchester United on Monday would go some way to reaffirming Southampton as Champions League contenders. The  midfielder (right) is relishing the challenge of facing boyhood club Manchester United on Monday . United are a team he relishes facing. Growing up in Nairobi, he dreamed of playing for them and it is a dream he still harbours. ‘My father Noah was a footballer and he used to talk as if he knew everything,’ he laughs. ‘He used to say “when you’ve been a footballer you can talk to me’’ so I thought that’s what I’ll become. It drove me. ‘United were my team. When their games were on we used to go to an old theatre where you had to pay to watch movies and then extra for United games. Sometimes they would stop the movies to show United’s match. ‘I had posters of Roy Keane and Paul Scholes on my wall. They were my favourite players who I wanted to be. If I could take anything from them maybe it would be Keane’s passion, his fire. I wanted to shake his hand after we played Aston Villa the other week but I didn’t find him. It’s a shame he has left.’ Today Wanyama holds up Wayne Rooney as his favourite United player. ‘He is the best English player. He is strong, powerful, he has that anger that drives his team. He lifts them, sometimes carries them. The type of guy you would always want on your side.’ Wanyama has hailed captain Wayne Rooney as his favourite United player in the current team . Wanyama feels comfortable rubbing shoulders with such illustrious company now. ‘I’m confident but never relaxed. You can’t be relaxed in the Premier League, there are too many teams who can trip you up, too many strong players.’ He credits his former Celtic manager Neil Lennon for making him more streetwise, while Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman have helped him refine a reputation as one of the Premier League’s most consistent midfielders. His performances have drawn admiring glances and he is not short of aspirations. ‘I want to play in the Champions League again, it is the pinnacle for every player,’ he says. ‘Can I do it with Southampton? We are good enough. Why not?’ Wanyama was also full of praise for  Ronald Koeman for helping him produce more consistent displays .","Southampton host Manchester United in the Premier League on Monday .

"Gary Neville remembers an expression Cristiano Ronaldo used during his time at Manchester United. ‘Too much water kills the plant,’ remarked Ronaldo when Neville asked why he eased off in the final two sprints of an eight circuit session put on by United’s coaching staff. The player knew his body. He had done the hard yards in 2006, returning from the World Cup in Germany ripped. The stories of Ronaldo in the gym performing thousands of sits ups or press ups a day, at United and with Real Madrid, are legendary. Cristiano Ronaldo (right) showed off his well-honed physique after scoring in the Champions League final . That body has come as a result of the amount of training Ronaldo (right, stretching with Portugal) puts in . Raheem Sterling warms up in Tallinn after being named on the England bench after complaining of fatigue . Neville admits it opened his eyes to new methods, a different way of approaching fitness work after working his way through various academy teams at The Cliff. ‘I'd always been brought up to believe that every single minute of every day was a fight and that you had to battle continuously, even in training. ‘But though he (Ronaldo) would work hard, he would train with efficiency.’ England’s head coach Roy Hodgson is old school and he has admitted on a number of occasions that he has no interest in statistics. This is a mistake, particularly when England bring in some of the leaders in their field to analyse the squad on international duty. These days they are not just tracking positions on the pitch. The sports scientists in the England set-up take saliva tests first thing in the morning from each player to check if they have slept properly. They know the results within minutes. Stay up late into the night on the PlayStation or Xbox and the experts will know about it when they stick a nitric test strip into the mouth of each player when they meet for breakfast. They test a player’s cortisol level, an indicator of stress, as part of the analysis. Burning the midnight oil, being stressed or anxious about a situation, activates the cortisol hormone. On the field, heart rate monitors on each player during every training session are downloaded at the end of training and will tell England’s management team if anyone is being overloaded. That is the modern way, but by far the most important person to listen to is the player himself. Raheem Sterling knows his body better than anyone. By flagging up his personal thoughts on the day of England’s final training session before they travelled up to Estonia, it seems Sterling probably talked himself out of the team. It was a little naive, particularly when stories abound about the sacrifices players made in the past to pursue a career in the game. For example, in the early days of Carlton Cole’s career at Chelsea, when no-one recognised him (or certainly wouldn’t dream of ratting on him), he would turn out for his uncle’s Sunday side in Hounslow, west London, the day after a reserve game. Roy Hodgson speaks to Sterling on Saturday, but the forward probably talked himself out of the England team . Sterling (second right) sat on the bench for 64 minutes of England's victory over Estonia . When Cristiano Ronaldo was the same age Raheem Sterling is now, he had played eight more matches. The Liverpool man would do well to follow the Portuguese's example . Ronaldo: Sporting (25), Portugal U15, U17, U20, U21 & U23 (34), Portugal full national team (18), Manchester Utd (60) 137 matches . Sterling: Liverpool (87), England U16, U17, U19, U21 (31), England full national team (11). 129 matches . There are numerous examples from bygone eras of players representing school sides on Saturday morning before turning out for a men’s team in the afternoon. There will be sportsmen in other disciplines who will be surprised that a 19-year-old footballer is prepared to approach his manager and admit to being fatigued. Take Rafa Nadal, for example, a tennis player who, like the majority of players working at the elite level, relies on explosive power in short bursts to cover his working area. Listen to him talk about his sessions with physical trainer Joan Forcades and perhaps football has some lessons to learn from athletes who are the top of their game in other sports. Writing in his book RAFA, he talks about his training regime one or two days before match. ‘There was another thing Forcades was emphatic about: that we should stick to the training regime even when I least felt like it, when I was tired or in a bad mood or, for whatever reason, just not feeling up to it. Video courtesy: R Buxton / @RichardBuxton_ . Rafa Nadal, pictured in the Italian Open earlier this year, practises for between four and six hours a day . ‘There were days during a tournament when I would not be feeling at my best either and by training in such circumstances I’d be better prepared to compete when I was below par.’ Nadal practises, including gym and court work, for anywhere between four and six hours a day, depending on his schedule. If you apply Nadal’s training principles to the England team then Sterling had very little to complain about when he spoke with Hodgson on Saturday morning. Perhaps Sterling is unaware of the sacrifices sportsmen make in other fields, but he paid the price for his honesty. Hodgson himself is an inflexible type and he will be very much of the mind that every England cap has to be earned by the players in his squad. After this, it is down to Neville to turn mediator.

"Steve Bruce is ready to terminate Hatem Ben Arfa’s loan spell at Hull City after dragging him off just 35 minutes into their 3-0 defeat at Manchester United.

Hatem Ben Arfa (left) is set to leave Hull after angering Steve Bruce during defeat to Manchester United . Ben Arfa, who had already been substituted in the 35th minute, enraged manager Bruce during half-time . Bruce could not be contacted on Friday night and Hull categorically denied that there is any problems between the manager and player. Ben Arfa, who had already been substituted in the 35th minute when they were a goal down, enraged Bruce with his performance at Old Trafford. The Hull chief believes it was disrespectful to his team-mates and wants to cut short his loan spell at the KC Stadium. Hull signed the winger from Newcastle until the end of the season but intend to cut short the loan deal . Ben Arfa is spoken to by Bruce before making his home debut for Hull against West Ham back in September . Hull boss Bruce believes Ben Arfa was disrespectful to his team-mates and wants to cut short his loan spell . Bruce immediately axed him from the clash with Everton in midweek and is unlikely to feature in their Barclays Premier League fixture against West Brom on Saturday. Hull signed the troubled winger from Newcastle on transfer deadline day until the end of the season, but the Tigers intend to cut it short and send him back to St James’ Park. Hull were a goal down when Bruce made the switch at Old Trafford by bringing on Sone Aluko to take Ben Arfa’s place in the Hull team. Emotions were already running high at Old Trafford because it was Bruce’s 700th game in charge as a manager on the return to the club where he lifted the Premier League three times in the Nineties. Hull gave Ben Arfa a lifeline at the start of the season and he appeared to be rediscovering his form . Bruce is attempting to arrest a slide that has left Hull out of the relegation zone on goal difference . Winger Ben Arfa has dazzled and disappointed in equal measure since signing for Newcastle back in 2010 . Ben Arfa has had a chequered career in English football and was banished to the reserve team at Newcastle under manager Alan Pardew. Hull gave him a lifeline at the start of the season by taking the France winger on loan and he appeared to be rediscovering his form in a flourishing early spell. But his attitude has come under scrutiny in recent weeks and he appears to have played his last game for the club after the remarkable events at Old Trafford. On Friday night, Hull claimed the player trained as normal with the first team this morning and insist he is a model professional.","Hatem Ben Arfa is to be kicked out of Hull and sent back to Newcastle .

"The board showing two added minutes had just been held up and Croatia set about trying to salvage some pride. But the more those in blue shirts chased the ball, the further away it went. England, bursting with confidence and belief, were tormenting their hosts, sending them dizzy with possession as they dumped them out of Euro 2015. England qualified for the 2015 European Under 21 Championship with a 4-2 aggregate win over Croatia in their play-off . England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate celebrates after guiding his team to their 10th straight victory . Croatia U21: Livakovic, Milos, Datkovic, Mitrovic, Milic, Pasalic (Caktas 67), Halilovic (Misic 79), Bradaric, Pjaca, Livaja, Rebic (Bagaric 33). Subs not used: Delac, Galovic, Perica, Brucic. Goals: Livaja 38. England U21: Butland, Dier, Moore, Gibson, Shaw, Hughes, Forster-Caskey, Carroll, Redmond (Ince 85), Kane, Berahino. Subs not used: Bond, Garbutt, Pritchard, Lascelles, Baker, Woodrow. Goals: Moore 9, Hughes 73. Booked: Hughes. Referee: Clement Turpin (France). And to think they say England never win with style. With the stakes high and the pressure intense, England secured a place at next summer’s Under 21 European Championship in a very un-English way. There was no scrapping, no backs against the wall, no bitten fingernails, just the smooth execution of meticulous planning and preparation. Thanks to goals from Leicester’s Liam Moore and Derby midfielder Will Hughes, giving them a 2-1 win on the night — 4-2 on aggregate — Gareth Southgate’s squad will head to the Czech Republic next summer as one of the favourites to lift the trophy. As England were victorious in Vinkovci, playing football as it should be, Spain — winners of this competition in 2011 and 2013 — were falling by the wayside, as were Holland. Do not underestimate what an achievement it is to be in the finals of this tournament. Southgate has not put a foot wrong in the last 13 months and this game saw everything he has been working towards fall into place. England, even without many key players, dismantled Croatia and in the process laid down a blueprint for the future. Vinkovci, famed for being the town where the train broke down on Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express, may have been a surprise destination for this game, but the hosts were welcoming and there was no sinister edge, as had been the case in Krusevac when England faced Serbia two years ago. Croatia almost had the perfect start, too. With just two minutes gone, they broke swiftly down England’s left and Marko Pjaca crossed for Mario Pasalic, who seemed certain to score with a right-foot half-volley, until Jack Butland intervened. England took the lead through Liam Moore (second left) in the first half in Vinkovci and never looked back . Moore slotted into the top corner from a set-piece in the ninth minute to extend England's aggregate advantage . Butland cannot get a game for Stoke but he is a cornerstone of this England team and the captain showed his worth with a magnificent instinctive save to thwart Pasalic. Given the delicate balance of this contest, it was a moment of great significance. Croatia had been bolstered by the presence of Barcelona B midfielder Alen Halilovic, one of the finest young talents in Europe. He had warmed up for this by playing 30 minutes for Croatia’s senior side on Monday night against Azerbaijan. Moore runs away to celebrate his goal having given England the lead in Vinkovci in the second leg of their play-off . Ante Rebic reacts in despair as England celebrate taking the lead in the second leg in Vinkovci . England, however, swiftly got back on an even keel and began passing the ball in the manner Southgate desires. They had willing runners, particularly in the shape of the eye-catching Nathan Redmond, and a belief they could cause Croatia problems. So it proved. In the eighth minute, a corner that had been won by the tenacity of Hughes was swung in by Tom Carroll and met flush on the volley by Moore, who jubilantly wheeled away after his shot had hit the roof of Croatia’s net. Moore had silenced the home supporters and given his team the confidence to look for the second goal that would have killed the tie.

Croatian supporters get behind their team in the second leg of their play-off against England . It should have arrived in the 36th minute when Hughes surged into the area, but seemed reluctant to shoot. The ball fell to Redmond but his effort was straight at keeper Dominik Livakovic. In the next attack, a long ball was hit up field by Filip Bradaric and, as England’s defence dithered, Marko Livaja nipped in to score. Now Halilovic began to impress. One ball he played with outside of his left foot to launch an attack, having not broken his stride, was majestic. But half-time gave England the chance to regroup and they began the second period with a renewed sense of calm. This was England’s biggest test, but they were passing it with style. Saido Berahino might have won it in the 59th minute but his shot smashed against the post. No matter. Not long after, the outstanding Hughes waltzed forward and finished with aplomb. Cue celebrations. It was his 13th game and 10th consecutive win. And, for Southgate, it was just about perfect.","England secure place at 2015 European Under 21 Championship with play-off win over Croatia .

"Sam Allardyce's feud with the Senegal national team has intensified with the West Ham boss claiming he does not trust them to look after Diafra Sakho. Mystery still surrounds the back injury the striker picked up while on international duty last month, even if it is not as severe as first thought. Allardyce confirmed the 24-year-old has a shot of making the West Ham squad for the fixture against Swansea after an earlier diagnosis suggested he would be out until the end of the month. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce's feud with the Senegal national team intensified on Friday . West Ham manager Allardyce claims he does not trust Senegal to look after Diafra Sakho . But Allardyce is still seething at an injury he claimed was not caused by playing or training and says the player was ‘mistreated so badly’. Allardyce now has a dilemma over whether to stretch his club’s own medical resources in order to send a chaperone when Sakho rejoins the Senegal side for the African Cup of Nations in January. Asked if he trusted the Senegal medical team with Sakho, Allardyce said: ‘I don’t, is the answer to that. ‘I think that we’ll have to have a discussion about that later down the line. We may consider sending somebody with them — to look after our asset.’ Mystery still surrounds the back injury the striker picked up while on international duty last month . In Sakho’s absence, Andy Carroll has returned from a run of considerably worse injury problems which have wrecked his time at the club. On Sunday, Allardyce will get a close view of Wilfried Bony, the prolific striker he opted against signing in 2013 in order to recruit Carroll for £15million. He said: ‘We didn’t have enough money that year (to sign Bony as well). There is always a risk with any player that comes from abroad. Of course, in Swansea’s case it has paid off handsomely.’ Allardyce now has a dilemma over whether  to send a chaperone when Sakho rejoins the Senegal side .","Diafra Sakho picked up a back injury on international duty last month .

"Manchester United were not in decline when I left... David Moyes was sacked because his team were too slow . I had nothing to do with David Moyes' sacking . I tried to convince David Moyes to keep Mike Phelan as his assistant manager . Louis van Gaal is formidable... and he and Ryan Giggs can learn from each other . Sir Alex Ferguson has rubbished claims that he exerted too much influence at Manchester United after his retirement but admits he spoke to Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra about their futures. The 72-year-old spent 26-and-a-half years at Old Trafford before retiring in 2013 and insists he kept a 'respectful' distance during successor David Moyes' ultimately doomed reign. Ferguson says his former players did not come to him to complain as United's season unravelled but says Ferdinand and Evra sought him out for advice. Patrice Evra and Rio Ferdinand (right) both left Manchester United in the summer . Sir Alex Ferguson (right) has revealed he spoke to Ferdinand about his future at United . Patrice Evra was signed by Ferguson from Monaco in 2006 and stayed at the club until this summer . Ferguson has been cricitised for his continued presence at United but has hit back at the claims . Ferguson and Moyes arrive together at the  annual League Managers Association awards in 2013 . The front cover of Ferguson's autobiography . 'Did players come to see me to complain?' Ferguson writes in his updated book, My Autobiography, published on Thursday but leaked on Tuesday. 'Did they hell. Utter nonsense.' He goes on to write that Ferdinand did 'ask my advice on his future' and that he had a similar chat with Evra. Ferdinand left United in the summer when the club decided not to offer him a new contract after his old deal expired, while Evra was sold to Juventus for £1.5million after the £31m purchase of Luke Shaw. Both players were stalwarts of Ferguson's later teams. The Scot also dismisses claims that he exerted too much influence at United even after his retirement. He says he never went into the dressing rooms and considering the training ground Carrington 'out of bounds'. Some have said his presence at games and at the club, where he still kept an office, made it harder for Moyes, but Ferguson hits back saying: '(Moyes) was glad to see me there (at games).' A measure of Ferguson's dwindling influence at United can be seen in his claim that he knew nothing of Moyes' sacking. 'I was in Aberdeen as the events unfolded,' he writes. 'On the Monday, I was flying back to Manchester and sitting next to me was a lad with a newspaper that ran: ""David Moyes to be sacked""'. He then spoke to executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward when he returned home and established 'a final decision had already been made'. He also says he had no influence regarding the appointment of Louis van Gaal. Like our Manchester United Facebook page.","Sir Alex Ferguson says Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra asked his advice .

"Former Oklahoma running back Brennan Clay is continuing to publicly accuse his wife of cheating on him with college team-mate and Dallas Cowboys star DeMarco Murray, now posting what he claims are intimate text messages between the two to Twitter. And he says there are more are to come. Clay played alongside Murray for the University of Oklahoma Sooners in the 2010 season, but announced to the world this week that his wife of just five months, Gina D'Agostini, is having an affair with Murray. VIDEO Scroll down to see Brennan Clay's workout routine on Instagram . Brennan Clay (pictured) has accused his wife of having an affair with Dallas Cowboys star DeMarco Murray . Cowboys running back  Murray (left) has been accused of having an affair with Dallas fitness instructor Gina D'Agostini - who also happens to be the wife of his former college team-mate Clay . Ex-Oklahoma Sooners running back Clay (pictured in 2013) has publicly claimed his wife of just five months is cheating on him with the Cowboys star . Taking it a step further on Thursday night, the 22-year-old revealed explicit texts he allegedly found in his wife's phone, including one about the two having sex in his own bed, according to Gawker. Clay said the text conversation happened on October 5, once he left to go to training for the San Diego Chargers. After saying goodbye to Clay at the airport, D'Agostini appears to text the 26-year-old Murray, saying that her 'roomate(sic)' has gone. Clay claims his wife disguised Murray's number in her phone by saving it under 'Spray Tan'. 'So I can f*** u in your bed now?' Murray allegedly wrote back. 'Is that where you want to f*** me? And yes,' D'Agostino allegedly replied. Clay took to Twitter on December 4 to air his views about wife's alleged antics with Murray . Clay also shared screenshots of D'Agostini's phone as 'proof' of affair of her affair with Murray . Clay also posted his ironic amusement at the fact that D'Agostini saved Murray's name under 'Spray Tan' To further prove his point, Clay also posted another screen shot of his wife's phone, showing the 'Spray Tan' number to have an area code of Las Vegas, where Murray is from. His online rant first started on Sunday, saying he found more than 50 'inappropriate' texts. 'So Demarco Murray was having an affair with my wife...I'm done...' Clay wrote  to his nearly 25,000 followers. Clay did not specify how long he believes his wife and the NFL player were together, nor did he say whether the affair has ended. However, he did offer a couple of reasons their alleged affair is so wrong. Clay (left) and D'Agostini have been married for just five months, according to his Facebook page . '1 has a baby momma and she has 2 kids,' he wrote. Michigan native D'Agostini does not have children with Clay. Murray has a baby with former Passions actress Heidi Mueller. Clay failed to mention what might make such an affair so painful for him, besides the obvious feeling of betrayal: he and D'Agostini have been married just five months according to a Facebook profile that appears to belong to him. Clay did not fail to convey how he feels about the alleged breach of trust, however. 'I'm disgusted...' Clay wrote, before heading off for some spiritual consolation. Murray (centre) and Clay first played together during the 2010 season for the University of Oklahoma . 'On that note headed to church,' he tweeted before his account went silent for a few hours. Clay played for the Sooners for four seasons starting in 2010, Murray's last year on the team, the New York Post reports. He went on to go to training camp with the Broncos but was let go in August. His more successful former teammate Murray was selected in the third round of the 2011 draft by the Cowboys, where he remains today. Murray had not responded to the accusations as of Sunday evening. D'Agostini makes a living as a fitness instructor in Dallas, according to her Facebook page.

"Newsagent Jarrett Rivers will tell his mum to keep a copy of every newspaper from the shop in which they work after he stole the headlines and sent non-league Blyth Spartans into the third round of the FA Cup.

"Ronny Deila insists Celtic are still in the race for Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard despite facing competition from some of the biggest clubs in Europe. The 15-year-old, the youngest player ever to represent his country, spent this week at Liverpool – the latest in a string of giants to fight for his signature. But Deila, who gave the player his debut at Stromsgodset before leaving for Celtic, believes the fact Odegaard, and not his club, is in control of his destiny, means his next move won’t necessarily be determined by who bids the highest. Celtic boss Ronny Deila has refused to give up hope of signing 15-year-old wonderkid Martin Odegaard . ‘He is a very good player but we have to stand in line - there are 20 clubs, maybe more, who want him,’ Deila said. ‘He has been to clubs all over Europe; to Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich Dortmund and Liverpool. PSG wanted him but he hasn’t had time to visit so there is some hard competition. ‘I have control over that situation, I know what is happening there. This is more about his choices. What is his thinking now? Is it go to a big club and try to break in there? Or go to a smaller club in not such a good league but (where) it easier to get into the first-team? ‘I think it is up to Martin. If he chooses Real Madrid, it would be what they want to pay. If he chooses Celtic, then there are different prices. He has one year left on his contract and I think it’s important Stromsgodset get money back for him.’ Celtic boss Deila (right) gave Odegaard his debut at Stromsgodset before leaving for the Scottish giants . Deila says Celtic have not made their interest in Odegaard known officially to Stromsgodset but believes his contacts in Drammen will keep him informed of any developments. ‘I haven’t (made Celtic’s interest clear),’ he added. ‘But I have control over the situation. ‘I know what’s happening. He’s in the town where my kids live and I know a lot of people there. ‘We’ll see. If there are possibilities, of course, we will try it. But it’s a very hard competition.’ At 15, the teenage sensation is the youngest player ever to represent Norway . With five loan signings on Celtic’s books just now, Deila has not discounted the possibility of attempting to bring Odegaard to Glasgow for a season were he to head for the continent. ‘You never know, but we want to have players that we want to get something for if we develop them,’ he said. ‘You can’t have too many players from other clubs. We need to have players who we can earn money on or who can stay at our club.’ Asked if Odegaard was good enough at the moment to play for Celtic, Deila replied: ‘It’s very hard to say. He’s only 15 years old and will be 16 this month, but he is very special and every time he gets to a new level, he takes his chance. His attitude is great - he always wants to learn and he listens to everything you say, He’s special.’","Martin Odegaard has spent this week training with Liverpool .

Her face can be seen, something forbidden by the militants'  interpretation of Islam. She apologises for the transparency of her veil, to which the man responds: 'You have to pay attention by covering up. God loves women who are covered.' The unidentified woman is approached by gunmen in a car and chastised for her appearance . The report, aired on a French TV channel, describes how there is no music, no entertainment and forced prayer times. It also features some of the estimated 150 women who have chosen to leave France to live in the Islamic State. The camerawoman enters an internet cafe where women are seen talking in French and contacting family members they have left behind. One woman tells her mother: 'I am not going back, mom. I am telling it to you bluntly. You have to get it through your head that I am not returning. 'I did not take the risk by coming here to go back to France. I do not want to return because I am doing well here mom. There is nothing to gain from weeping or being afraid.' A woman tells her mother in France: 'I am not going back, mom. I am telling it to you bluntly. You have to get it through your head that I am not returning' Her mother's anguish is justified. Raqqa was targeted by the U.S. and its Arabic allies in a series of air strikes this week. The daughter, defends her new homeland, adding: 'All I see on TV is false. They exaggerate everything on TV.' The French narrator says: 'These women coming here to get married or to join their husbands would be an essential element of the strategy and propaganda of the fundamentalist camp.'","The unidentified woman captures rare glimpse into life in new regime .

"Troy Deeney’s hat-trick eased the pressure on manager Slavisa Jokanovic as Watford put in five star performance at Fulham to end a run of four successive defeats. In a week that all clubs are coming together to mark the Christmas Day truce during the First World War, Watford showed they were in no mood to extend that good feeling a century later as they climbed to sixth in the Championship thanks to Deeney’s treble and two from Almen Abdi. Jokanovic said: 'It is a very good day for us and we made close to a perfect performance . VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Fulham 0-5 Watford .

I don't have time for thinking about my future as I don't want to spend my time thinking about what will happen tomorrow. 'We are starting a job and other people exist who decide if this is with enough quality or not.' Watford were the better team from the start and Daniel Tozer tested Marcus Bettinelli in the Fulham goal with a curling free-kick which had the England U21 keeper at full stretch to tip the ball over the bar. And minutes later Tozer was playing provider as his long ball found Deeney who headed the ball over the on-rushing Bettinelli but Kostos Stafylidis was able to get back to clear the ball off the line. But Watford did take the lead minutes later when Abdi’s low free-kick went through Deeney’s legs in the wall and wrong-footed Bettinelli to give the Hornets a deserved lead. Almen Abdi's low free-kick went through the wall to put Watford ahead in the 15th minute . Fulham keeper Marcus Bettinelli is shown a straight red card for bringing down Matej Vydra . Things went from bad to worse for Fulham after Bettinelli was shown a red card for bringing down Matej Vydra and conceding a penalty. Veteran keeper Gabor Kiraly came off the bench, but could do nothing to stop Deeney doubling Watford’s lead from the spot. And the game was over before the break when Deeney grabbed his second of the game. Gianni Munari cushioned header played in Deeney who was alert to beat the offside trap and touch the ball through Kiraly’s legs. And the visitors showed no intention of taking their foot off the gas in the second half as they scored fourth, and best, goal of the night shortly after the break. Watford striker Troy Deeney scores second goal from the penalty spot . Deeney scores third goal past Watford substitute keeper Gabor Kiraly . Nothing looked on as Vyddra played the ball to Abdi, but the Swiss midfielder looked up and fired a shot from 30 yards which arrowed into the top corner leaving Kiraly to look on helplessly. Deeney completed his hat-trick with the final kick of the game when he slotted past Kiraly after latching onto a through ball from Munari. The defeat was Kit Symons’ heaviest in his short spell as Fulham manager and only his second loss at home in the league since replacing Felix Magath in September. Symons said: ‘You have to try and learn from it. There is quite a lot we can learn. It is obvious there is a lot of hard work and improvement to be done. ‘Down to 10 and 2-0 down it is a mountain to climb.

"The moon once had a magnetic core which helped it generate a magnetic field stronger than Earth's is now, researchers say. They believe a lunar dynamo, a molten, churning core at the centre of the moon, may have powered an intense magnetic field for at least 1 billion years. However, researchers are still baffled by how it was powered, and when it ended. A lunar dynamo, a molten, churning core at the centre of the moon, may have powered an intense magnetic field for at least 1 billion years. Planetary dynamos are generated by the process of induction, in which the energy of turbulent, conducting fluids is transformed into a magnetic field. The motion of Earth’s liquid core is powered by the cooling of the planet, which stirs up buoyant fluid from the surrounding liquid — similar to what happens in a lava lamp. 'We think planets generate magnetic fields by moving electrically conducting fluids inside them,' said study co-author Benjamin Weiss, a planetary scientist at MIT. Flowing metal in Earth's core makes the heart of the planet a dynamo - a generator of electrical current - which in turn generates Earth's magnetic field. Planetary dynamos are generated by the process of induction, in which the energy of turbulent, conducting fluids is transformed into a magnetic field. The motion of Earth’s liquid core, for instance, is powered by the cooling of the planet, which stirs up buoyant fluid from the surrounding liquid. 'similar to what happens in a lava lamp,' said Wiess. 'We have recently argued from magnetic studies of Apollo samples that the moon also generated a dynamo in its molten metal core. 'Our data suggest that, despite the moon’s tiny size — only 1 percent of the Earth’s mass — its dynamo was surprisingly intense (stronger than Earth’s field today) and long-lived, persisting from at least 4.2 billion years ago until at least 3.56 billion years ago. 'This period, which overlaps the early epoch of intense solar system-wide meteoroid bombardment and coincides with the oldest known records of life on Earth, comes just before our earliest evidence of the Earth’s dynamo.' The moon today does not have a global magnetic field. However, moon rocks that astronauts collected during the Apollo missions suggested the moon once had a magnetic field billions of years ago. But scientists were uncertain whether the moon generated a magnetic field the same way Earth does, or if the magnetic fields seen on the moon were instead produced by outside forces. The moon today does not have a global magnetic field. However, moon rocks that astronauts collected during the Apollo missions suggested the moon once had a magnetic field billions of years ago. For instance, cosmic impacts on the moon could have sparked super-heated plasma that generated strong, brief magnetic fields, explaining the magnetized rocks the astronauts discovered. Weiss and former MIT student Sonia Tikoo's review, published in Science, believe the corew ould have been 'a convective dynamo powered by crystallization of an inner core could potentially sustain a lunar magnetic field for billions of years,' he told MIT News. 'An exotic dynamo mechanism that could explain the moon’s strong field intensity is that the core was stirred by motion of the solid overlying mantle, analogous to a blender. 'The moon’s mantle was moving because its spin axis is precessing, or wobbling, and such motion was more vigorous billions of years ago, when the moon was closer to the Earth.

"7,000 of the 10,000 women diagnosed per year with HER2-positive breast cancer do not respond well to Herceptin, the standard medicine . A breakthrough by scientists could lead to a new treatment for one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer. They have pinpointed the molecule which causes cancerous cells to grow and spread very quickly, making them hard to treat. Now that researchers have found the specific molecule, they are confident they can use an existing drug to stop the cancer in its tracks. The discovery offers hope for women diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer, which tends to spread far more quickly than other types. It affects 10,000 women a year – a fifth of all cases – and of these around 7,000 do not respond well to the current standard treatment, a medicine called Herceptin. Researchers from the Bart’s Cancer Institute at Queen Mary University of London conducted the study. They hope that in future women could have tumour biopsies to check for the presence of the molecule. If found, they would be offered the existing drug – which is mainly only used in trials – alongside Herceptin. Early studies on mice have shown that the combination of these two treatments eradicates the tumours. Around 50,000 women develop breast cancer a year and it causes just under 12,000 deaths.But . although survival rates have improved in recent decades, campaigners . are concerned they still lag far behind those of other European . countries. They are particularly worried that there . are so few treatments available for those women with the most aggressive . forms of breast cancer. Breast Cancer Campaign funded the study. Its chief executive, Baroness Delyth Morgan, said: ‘Despite great advances in the past 20 years, five-year breast cancer survival in the UK is worse than the European average. ‘Breast cancer is not a done deal and much more must be done to improve survival rates. 'There is a desperate need for drugs which work in new ways to give the thousands of women diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer the best possible chances of surviving the disease. ‘This study could pave the way for new treatments and bring us closer to our goal of preventing half of the deaths from breast cancer by 2025, through improved and personalised treatments.’ Researchers from the Bart's Cancer Institute at Queen Mary University of London, who conducted the survey, hope in the future that women could have tumour biopsies to check for the presence of the molecule (stock pic) The research, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, looked at tumour samples provided by 2,000 women with breast cancer. About 40 per cent of them were found to contain this molecule – known as αvβ6. In further experiments on mice, they used another treatment called 264RAD to target this molecule and found it completely eradicated the tumours. They will now carry out trials on women to test how well this treatment works alongside Herceptin. If successful, it is hoped the treatment would be routinely available within the next ten years. Dr John Marshall, from Queen Mary, who led the study said: ‘High αvβ6 levels could be tested for in routine biopsies to identify which women are at a high risk of metastasis, (cancer spreading), ensuring these women can receive personalised treatment, improving their chances of survival.’","10,000 women per year diagnosed with the HER2-positive breast cancer .

"It's almost 29 years to the week since I made my Arsenal debut as a 19-year-old. That feels like a lifetime ago, but some things in football never change: everybody wants to see young players come through. The good news is that this season more managers are willing to give the kids a chance. So far 21 players aged 21 or under have made their Premier League debuts this campaign. More than half of those are defenders and that’s unusual for a position that requires great maturity. But it does prove one thing: if you’re good enough, you’re old enough. This year Manchester United’s Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair, Eric Dier at Tottenham and Hull’s Andrew Robertson, whose average age is just under 20, have each made a significant impact on his team. That is good to see. Defender Tyler Blackett (right) has made quite an impact at Manchester United this season . Too many people think the step up from youth team to first team is a massive one. Yes there is a jump in quality, but if you’re an ambitious youngster, it should just be another game. The problem for young players is that it often takes a special set of circumstances to play. Are they ready? Is the incumbent injured or out of form? What if they don’t fit the manager’s style? Managers are under so much pressure that they might not want to play a young lad in a key role. That’s why you tend to see more young attackers than defenders playing. Defenders normally get better with age. Paddy McNair (right) has repaid the faith of Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal . It’s human nature to look at what people can’t do but if you make yourself part of a winning team, those doubts quickly disappear. Possession is nine tenths of the law in football — if you’ve got the shirt and the side is winning, then the manager has a difficult decision to make. At Arsenal, John Cartwright had to persuade Don Howe to play me but after the first game at West Brom my next two were against Liverpool and Man United. We won both. Tony Adams was already playing and our youth team included Michael Thomas, David Rocastle, Niall Quinn and Paul Merson. Hull’s Andrew Robertson (right) has shown if you're good enough, you're old enough at the top level . A group like that is rare, but when we saw Tony doing it — and he went on to become the club’s youngest captain at 21 —we knew we could make it too: success breeds success. Some managers don’t trust young players in positions of responsibility —they would sooner play a young goalkeeper than a young centre half. But Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has always been happy to field young players and his use of Blackett and McNair this season is first-class management. People assume playing centre back at Old Trafford is too much pressure for a kid. These two have shown otherwise. Tottenham defender Eric Dier was signed from Sporting Lisbon for £4m in the summer . I don’t think either would have had a chance of playing last season but now they are important members of United’s squad. Blackett is strong, fast and a quick learner, an important skill for any defender. My sources tell me that McNair was only on the fringes of United’s Under 21s until Van Gaal trusted him to play. That faith has been repaid. Full back is slightly different as there is less defensive responsibility. Even so, Dier and Robertson have impressed and Calum Chambers has stood out for Arsenal — it’s easy to forget he’s still only 19. Tottenham striker Harry Kane, aged 21, has forced his way into the team . Further forward Ryan Mason, 23, and Harry Kane, 21, have forced themselves into the team at Spurs. I like both but it’s interesting to hear Mason say he isn’t a kid any more — his time is now. Players obviously develop at different stages but age should not be a reason to hold anyone back. We all want to see more youngsters at the top level, especially kids who have come through the academies.This season, at least, we are seeing more of them given a chance. P.S . It worries me when I see goalkeepers being surprised by conditions on the pitch. They are always the first ones out for the warm up so if they don’t get used to a dodgy surface in the hour before kick off something is wrong. If somebody shoots from outside the box, unless it’s a wonderstrike I expect the keeper to deal with it.","Manchester United's Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair have had a significant impact this season .

"Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are exerting ‘pressure’ on their Irish players around Republic of Ireland games and feels a ‘clear the air’ summit with manager Roberto Martinez is required. The Irish No 2 acknowledges Martinez has a duty to his club but feels ‘balance’ is needed regarding the international availability of James McCarthy, Seamus Coleman and Darron Gibson for the remainder of the Euro 2016 campaign. McCarthy has missed the last three Euro 2016 qualifiers, including Friday’s 1-0 loss to Scotland, but is expected to be fit for Everton’s game against West Ham on Saturday. VIDEO Scroll down to see Keane speak ahead of Ireland's clash with USA . Everton's James McCarthy has missed the Republic of Ireland's last three Euro 2016 qualifiers . Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty . It follows the events of last month where McCarthy and Coleman both played for their club, only four days after missing the Euro qualifier against world champions Germany. ‘I worry that he (McCarthy) is under lots of pressure, particularly from Everton’s point of view,’ said Keane on Sunday. ‘Because every time there is an international match it does seem to be Seamus (Coleman) and James (McCarthy) under lots of pressure. They’re turning up or they mightn’t turn up, or they’re struggling,’ he observed. ‘You always get the impression from Everton that Seamus and James are both barely able to walk, that type of thing. McCarthy is set to return to action for Everton against West Ham on Saturday despite his latest injury . Keane was speaking at a press conference ahead of his team's match against USA on Tuesday . ‘So when they actually turn up and they are walking through the reception, “Praise the Lord, it’s a miracle.” With Ireland’s Euro fate hinging on strong home form in the six qualifiers to come in 2015, Keane feels the point should be made to Martinez, in person, how important his players are to their country. ‘There has to be, I think, some sort of sit-down conversation and say, “Listen, I think Martin’s been more than good enough here, particularly the friendlies but these are big qualifying matches now,” said Keane. ‘Roberto Martinez has to look after his club and he is probably thinking they have European games. Seamus Coleman (right) missed ROI's match against Germany last month, but was deemed fit for Everton . ‘Roberto, I don’t think, has ever played senior level at international level and maybe he doesn’t appreciate how big it is for us and how big the games are for us,’ he added. Keane can still see where Martinez is coming from, just as Alex Ferguson was often unenthusiastic about Keane playing for Ireland, especially friendlies. ‘We talk about the manager here and the manager there but there’s a player in between all that, and I can speak from experience, he’s under lots of pressure too,’ said Keane. ‘There is a guarantee that when the player turns up (for internationals) they are getting phone calls left, right and centre from their 15 physios at the club.’ ‘You’re also hoping the player can make the decision and say, ‘I’ll give it a go’ or whatever it might be,’ he said. McCarthy missed the Scotland game despite an all-clear scan on his hamstring, which prompted speculation that his heart wasn’t up for a Glasgow return. Keane claims he is hoping to hold 'clear the air' talks with Everton manager Roberto Martinez . Keane appreciates the fact that Everton boss Martinez 'has to look after his club' Darron Gibson (left) sustained serious knee damage on Irish duty 13 months ago . ‘Some times it may be up to the player to say, “Listen, I’m going to try and train, whatever my club manager says or whatever the doctor says or whatever the scan says” because you do know your own body,’ observed Keane. ‘Whatever way you look at it, James didn’t train all week – it’s not as if he went out and had a jog, it’s not as if he’s joined in a little bit of possession. So that was a difficult one.’ Asked if McCarthy was afraid of being jeered in his native Glasgow, Keane said: ‘Nah, I don’t think so.’ ‘They (McCarthy and Aiden McGeady) declared for Ireland, they are Irish and are proud to be involved with us. I don’t think that (jeering) was an issue.’ If Martinez is protective of his players, he may have fair reason after Gibson sustained serious knee damage on Irish duty 13 months ago, which kept him out for almost a year.

"Manchester United’s Ander Herrera could be dragged into the on-going match-fixing investigation of the Spanish first division match between Levante and Zaragoza in the 2010-11 season. Reports in Spanish media on Tuesday suggest that Herrera, who was playing for Zaragoza at the time, is one of eight players who was paid a sum of money into his bank account by then Zaragoza president Iglesias Agapito, which he was then requested to return to his president in cash. The anti-corruption enquiry is investigating the possibility that Agapito used the money to pay off Zaragoza’s rivals Levante on the last day of the season in a game his team needed to win in order to stay up. Ander Herrera, in action against West Brom on Monday, has made a fine start to life in the Premier League . Herrera started his career at Real Zaragoza and is one of the players linked to an on-going investigation . There is no suggestion that Hererra and his team-mates knew what the money was for, or were knowingly involved in any wrongdoing, and then club captain Gabi, who is understood to have received two bank transfers, totaling 90,000 euros, is already understood to have told the investigation ‘I was doing what the club told me.’ According to reports, the investigation has found that the eight players, and then coach and current Japan manager Javier Aguirre, received the money in the week leading up to the match and returned it in cash to Agapito. The since-departed Zaragoza president has claimed the payments into his players’ accounts were a bonus but the players have vehemently denied this. If the case is accepted to court then Herrera could be called to give evidence in Spain or he could request special dispensation to do so in England. Former Zaragoza captain Gabi, now at Atletico Madrid,  has said ‘I was doing what the club told me.’ Former Zaragoza coach and current Japan manager Javier Aguirre is also said to have received money .","Levante match against Zaragoza from end of 2010-11 season investigated .

"Stopping and smelling the roses is now a matter of simply waiting at a bus stop, thanks to an idea which sees gardens planted on top of public transport vehicles. A prototype range of the adapted buses are aiming to purify air in cities that have a lack of urban green areas. Landscape artist Marc Granen's system, dubbed PhytoKinetic, uses condensation from the vehicle's air conditioning system to water the roof. The garden can also be manually watered. Fresh air: In years gone by smokers used to frequent the top deck, but now the roof is being used for an altogether cleaner purpose . Lung trans-plant: Designer Marc Granan argues cities need to grow with the general population in order to provide them with a clean and healthy environment . Attraction: The first prototype is already in use and has been transporting tourists across the city of Girona . His first bus is currently being used to transport tourists to and from a nature and camping facility in Girona, Spain. Last week he completed the first van in the world with a PhytoKinetic roof. Mr Granen said: 'Urban green areas are crucial for photosynthesis, a process in which plants absorb CO2 and release O2 - vital for purifying the air we breathe. 'The lungs of a city must grow at the same rate as its population, but much-needed green areas are not always available. 'Phytokinetic has grown out of this supposition, with the goal of delivering a practical and tangible solution. Groundbreaking: Designer and inventor of the PhytoKinetic, Marc Granen, at work . 'If finding new urban spaces for gardens is problematic, we can use spaces that already exist, such as the roofs of city public transport. 'Our mission is to expand the garden area in urban areas, increase the absorption of CO2 and give public transport a new ecological and tourist attraction.' The system uses lightweight 7cm-thick hydroponic foam, which retains humidity but not water, and helps to reduce the weight in periods of continuous rain. Small shrubs can then planted to suit the climate of the host city or to match a particular bus lines own identifying garden. To water the roof, it is only necessary to make use of the condensation of the air-conditioning units installed on the roof of the vehicle. The hotter it gets, and the more water the plants need, the more they are watered, by the simple act of using the air-conditioning. The bus's innovator added: 'It really started last summer, when I made the first prototype on a bus in a small town near Barcelona.'It stills working now and, thanks to its PhytoKinetic vegetable roof, temperature inside have decreased 3.5C. 'Since then, I've spent several months working in introducing improvements, and making it legal. 'Now, I am so proud this is a reality and has passed all technical and security controls.' Mr Granan is now in discussion with an auto company interested in sponsoring a fleet in Barcelona. His garden van will be one of the main attractions in Nantes at the Green International Congress in September. All aboard: The first garden bus in Spain has been specially designed to improve the quality of the air in the country's urban centres . Plant out: Mr Granan puts the finishing touches to the garden he has been planting, ready for it to be installed on top of a bus .

"ISIS has released images of their fighters engaging in street fighting in Kobane today, the latest dispatch from their slick publicity machine. The pictures, distributed by the media office in the ISIS 'capital' of Raqqa in Syria, show jihadis firing rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles in the ruined streets of the town. The eyes of the world have been on Kobane, where weeks of fighting have taken place within full view of the Turkish border. Scroll down for video . Skirmish: An ISIS militant fires a rocket-propelled grenade in the the streets of Kobane. This picture was issued by the Raqqa Media Office of ISIS . It has also emerged that ISIS fighters beat Kurdish children taken from the besieged Syrian border town of Kobane with electrical cables. Pictured, an ISIS militant fighting in the town . Kurdish militants fire a machine gun mounted on a truck at ISIS positions during fighting west of Kobane today . Islamic State militants have taken hundreds of Kurds captive over the past year as part of the group's brutal campaign to take over predominantly Kurdish areas of northern and eastern Syria . The town has become a symbolic test of the U.S.-led coalition's ability to halt the advance of ISIS, which has poured weapons and fighters into its assault of the town that has lasted more than a month. Meanwhile, Islamic State militants tortured and abused Kurdish children captured earlier this year near the  town of Kobane, according to an international rights group. Human Rights Watch based its conclusions on interviews with several children who were among more than 150 Kurdish boys from Kobane abducted in late May as they were returning home after taking school exams in the city of Aleppo. It said around 50 of the Kurds escaped early in their captivity, while the rest were released in batches - the last on October 29. 'Since the beginning of the Syrian uprising, children have suffered the horrors of detention and torture, first by the Assad government and now by Isis,' said Human Rights Watch spokesman Fred Abrahams. Four of the children who were released said they were held by the extremists in the northern Syrian town of Manbij. They described abuse at the hands of the militants, who used an electric cable to administer beatings. The eyes of the world have been on Kobane, where weeks of fighting have taken place within full view of the Turkish border. Pictured, ISIS militants in the town . Kobane has become a symbolic test of the U.S.-led coalition's ability to halt the advance of ISIS, which has poured weapons and fighters into its assault of the town that has lasted more than a month . 'This evidence of torture and abuse of children by ISIS underlines why no-one should support their criminal enterprise.' Four of the children who were released told Human Rights Watch that they were held by the extremists in the northern Syrian town of Manbij. They described frequent abuse at the hands of the militants, who used a hose and electric cable to administer beatings. The boys said some of the worst abuse was reserved for captives who had family members in the Kurdish militia known as the YPG, which has been locked in heavy fighting with Islamic State militants for control of Kobane since mid-September. Today it also emerged ISIS militants have publicly shot dead 36 Sunni tribesmen, women and children, pushing the number of members slain by the extremists in recent days to more than 200. Sheik Naim al-Gaoud, a senior figure in the Al Bu Nimr tribe, said the militant group killed 29 men, four women and three children, lining them up in in the village of Ras al-Maa, north of Ramadi in Anbar province. He said the extremists shot each of them dead one by one. Resolve: ISIS has poured fighters and resources into its assault on strategically-important Kobane . The tribal leader warned that 120 families were still trapped there. 'These massacres will be repeated in the coming days unless the government and its security forces help the trapped people,' Mr al-Gaoud said. Some Sunnis in Anbar province supported the militants when they seized Fallujah and parts of Ramadi in December. That came after widespread Sunni protests against the Shiite-led government in Baghdad for what they described as second-class treatment. These recent slayings, all committed in public, raise the death toll suffered by the Sunni Al Bu Nimr tribe in recent days at the hands of the Islamic State group to at least 214 tribal members killed. Analysts believe the Islamic State group may be trying to take revenge for the tribe siding with the American forces in the past, as well as Iraqi security forces. The killings will also likely terrify other Sunni tribes that would think of resisting the militants. Since the Islamic State group's offensive, a number of Iraq's Sunni tribes have been fundamental in stalling its advance, taking up arms and fighting alongside Iraqi security forces. A U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes is targeting the group as well, with nine strikes hitting its fighters yesterday and today in Beiji, Fallujah and Ar Rutbah, U.S. Central Command said.","ISIS media office in Raqqa released the images of the war-torn Syrian town .

The Becker’s had no idea that the children called 911 until the dispatch called the cell phone to check and see if everything was ok. Jennifer Becker apologized to the police and told them that nothing was wrong but nonetheless the Becker’s heard a knock on their door minutes later, reports Fox. When they opened the front door it was a police officer who explained to the boys hoping to get on Santa's good list, the proper use of 911. 'The kids, they looked scared and I don’t know if it was because they thought it was, like, Santa Claus, but when we opened it, it was a police officer,' she said. The officer from the Mayville Police Department who responded to the call explained to the boys that 911 are just for emergencies. Naughty or nice?: Blake (pictured) and his brother Brody were merely trying to tell Santa their wishlist . 'The children were counselled as far as the proper use of 911 and they were told that the best way to contact Santa Claus was in person,' Mayville Police Chief Christopher MacNeill told ABC News. The cops also gave the boys a tour of the police station on Wednesday and got a bit of a laugh out of the whole situation. 'I kind of chuckled a little bit,' he said, describing his reaction to the call. 'It’s good to know that there was no emergency but to hear that, you know, the two kids wanted to call Santa Claus, you know, was kind of humorous. But what we said is, basically, that the North Pole is out of our jurisdiction.' Becker says she's to blame for the kids attempting to call Santa because she told them about an actual Santa Hotline that plays a recording of Santa’s voice. Callers are told they may leave a message with Santa to tell them their Christmas list. 'Brody was asking for trucks and big cars, and Blake, he wants a bow and arrow, truck, a four-wheeler combine,' Becker said. Santa will be visiting the boys at their school Tomorrow, reports TMJ.","Brothers Blake, 6, and Brody, 3, dialed 911 on November 23 to talk to Santa and got a visit from the police .

"A 24-year-old British woman who died at a beauty clinic in Thailand had undergone cut-price plastic surgery to increase the size of her bottom, police said. The woman, named locally as Joy Williams, 24, from London, travelled to Bangkok for the £2,000 buttock augmentation operation on October 14, but her wounds became infected. She returned to the SP Clinic to have the silicone implants removed and died shortly after the second operation on Thursday night, Police Colonel Chayut Marayard said. Dr Sompob Saensiri, 51,  has been accused of negligence after he carried out night-time surgery without a licence. Scroll down for videos . Doctor Sompob Sansiri, 51, is lead away by police after a 24-year-old British woman died at his clinic while undergoing cosmetic surgery on her tailbone . Investigators believe that Sompob was not authorised to carry out the procedure at the clinic in Bagkok . Doctor Sompob Sansiri claimed to have trained in the U.S. and been practicing since 1998, but he is now facing ten years behind bars . Police said the doctor has been formally detained at the central criminal court, charged with recklessness causing death. He could face ten years in jail if convicted, but according to police he has insisted he has not broken any laws or deviated from normal surgical procedures. Her family were too upset to comment yesterday but friends described Miss Williams, who was born in Lagos, Nigeria, as a 'bright, caring girl'. They said she had struggled with self-esteem issued and had previously had an operation on her nose. One of Miss Williams' friends, who did not want to be named, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'She was a really, really nice girl. She was very friendly and caring. She was always helping her mum with her brothers. 'She was a very bright girl and did well at school. She was a bit shy and quiet and I knew in later years there was something wrong and upsetting her. 'At school she had been bullied over her appearance and she went for surgery on her nose and face. Last time I saw her it was obvious she had had cosmetic surgery. She was fine before, she didn't need to. She was fine the way she was but she just wasn't happy. She had no self esteem and I guess she felt she needed to do it. She was just never happy with herself.' In December 2009, a former Miss Argentina died following surgery to make her buttocks firmer. Solange Magnano (right), 38, was rushed to hospital with severe breathing problems after the cosmetic operation. The mother of eight-year-old twins died from a blocked lung artery after spending three days in a critical condition in intensive care. Denise Hendry, wife of former football star Colin Hendry, also died as the result of a liposuction operation in which the surgeon punctured her bowel nine times. She suffered a heart attack, multiple organ failure and blood poisoning, and spent five weeks in a coma. She survived the initial operation, but was forced to undergo 18 operations to fix her bowel. She died seven years later, aged just 42. Another former schoolfriend, who also asked not to be named, was in tears when she heard the news. 'I'm in total shock,' she said. 'I just can't believe it. Not Joy. Not her. She was lovely, she was my friend.' While in Bangkok, Miss Williams was staying at the £11 a-night Vabua Asotel hotel, which is used by the clinic as accommodation for its patients. Staff at the hotel said she was a quiet resident who had returned from her first operation in her green surgical gown. It was her third visit to Thailand, officials said, but it is not known if she had surgery when she was there in May 2011 and October 2012. It is not known if Miss Williams was in Bangkok alone. According to investigators, she was also given BodyTite liposuction treatments during her first visit. BodyTite works by inserting a tube under the skin which melts fat using radio waves before it is sucked out. There is also a plate on top of the skin which smooths the surface. The clinic charges between £850 and £1,100 for buttock liposuction, which includes all tests and consultations, however it is not yet clear exactly what surgery the victim was being given. Police and forensic officers were called to the SP Clinic in the Huay Kwang district of Bangkok at around 11pm yesterday to reports that a woman had stopped breathing. The officers found the victim lying on an operating table on the first floor of the four-storey clinic, but were unable to revive her. According to police, there was a three inch-long stitched incision on her tail bone. The body was then wrapped in white sheets and six policemen carried it to a waiting ambulance. It was taken to the Police General Hospital for a post mortem examination. Pol Maj Gen Ittipol Piriyapinyo told reporters that the woman had asked for a corrective procedure to her tailbone area and had visited the clinic before. According to reports, the operation had finished when doctors discovered they were unable to revive the woman. On the clinic's website, Dr Sompob claims to have studied at Chiang Mai University medical school in Thailand, graduating in 1992. According to police the woman had previously had liposuction treatment at the clinic (pictured, medics take her body away from the scene) Officers rushed to the clinic, in the Huay Kwang district of Bangkok at around 11pm yesterday, where they found the woman unconscious on the operating table . The woman was found with a three-inch long incision over her tailbone which had already been stitched up . The 24-year-old was found unconscious on the operating table of this clinic in Bangkok after apparently falling unconscious during a procedure on her tailbone . The profile says he began practicing in 1998, is a member of American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery and member of American Society of Hair Restorection Surgery. He also claims to be a member of three other cosmetic surgery societies in America and Korea, and a certified board of two more. Young British women are increasingly going to extreme lengths to get the 'perfect' derriere. Inspired by the gravity-defying posteriors of celebs like Nicki Minaj and Kim Kardashian West, more of us than ever are desperate for a bigger booty. Research from whatclinic.com, a private healthcare search engine, shows enquiries for buttock augmentation surgery have doubled in a year. In fact, after photographs of Kim K posing in a tiny gold bikini in Thailand emerged in April, enquiries shot up by 136 per cent. According to BAAPS (British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons) fat transfer operations – where fat is taken from the stomach and thigh area and reinserted in the buttocks – are up 13 per cent. This is despite the surgery carrying a hefty average price tag of £4,000. Officers are questioning staff and doctors at the premises, and trying to establish whether the clinic was stocked with the correct life-saving equipment. Lardprao police they have notified the British embassy and have sent her body to the Police Institute of Forensic Medicine for autopsy. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We were informed of the death of a British national in Thailand on October 23. We stand ready to provide consular assistance.' Thailand is the world-leader in cosmetic surgery tourism, with websites advertising package deals promising procedures at discounts of up to 60 per cent. While visitors form Australia and the U.S are particularly common, patients have also been known to visit the country from Britain. The industry earned the country £2.68billion in 2013 alone. Of the 26.5 million people who visited Thailand in 2013, 2.5 million went purely for medical reasons. That number has been growing at an average of 15 per cent a year over the past decade. The top procedure in Thailand is dental work, including teeth veneers, though websites advertise beast implants, face lifts, and even hip replacements. Dr Massimiliano Marcellino, a Harley Street surgeon at CosmeDocs who has performed over 5,000 operations, warned about the dangers of going abroad for surgery. Officers found the victim lying on an operating table on the first floor of the four-storey clinic, but were unable to revive her . According to investigators the woman was undergoing her second procedure at the clinic, the first being a BodyTite liposuction operation . Dr Sompob Saensiri, 51, a surgeon at the clinic has been arrested amid claims he was not qualified to carry out the procedure (pictured, officers outside the clinic) He said: 'Around a fifth of the correction surgeries I carry out are on patients who need help after visiting clinics overseas - mostly liposuction and facelifts in Eastern Europe. 'There are fantastic surgeons to be found the world over but the problem is the cosmetic surgery industry can be less regulated in some countries - so standards can vary dramatically depending on where you go. 'In the UK, a surgeon's performance is strictly monitored, with routine training and independent yearly appraisals. As with any form of surgery there are risks and it should not be undertaken lightly.' Dr Bryan Mayou is a plastic surgeon at the Cadogan Clinic, Chelsea, which has been frequented by the likes of Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding. He brought liposuction to the UK and has since carried out thousands of procedures. He said: 'Medical tourism is a thing which has been around for a long time. We in London benefit from it, so it is not surprising that people will shop around and often go abroad because it is cheaper. 'We are seeing an increase in the number of patients that are coming to us for corrections following cosmetic surgery abroad. 'At the clinic we have seen a 125 per cent increase in a year, and it can be for all sorts of procedures, but liposuction and breast surgery are the most common. 'If I were looking aboard, even as a surgeon I would find it extremely difficult to know who to trust. 'You have to ask: how is this clinic going to deal with problems? What happens if things go wrong? 'What appears to be a saving, in fact turns out to be anything but.' Investigators are trying to establish whether the clinic, in the Huay Kwang district of Bangkok, had proper life-saving equipment installed .","Joy Williams, 24, underwent a £2,000 buttock augmentation operation .

"They are scenes reminiscent of the 1963 Hitchcock classic film, The Birds. Every night, around 10,000 crows descend on the small town of Sunnyside in Washington. Now, police, citizens and local businesses are taking action against the booming influx of birds. Merchants have deployed fake owls on rooftops and surrounding trees, homeowners have cut down tall trees around their houses and one bank even plays a recording of screeching hawks. Scroll down for video . Influx: Every evening, around 10,000 crows descend on the small town of Sunnyside in Washington. Above, hundreds of the birds are pictured sitting on a tree in the town, which has a population of about 16,000 . 'Bird bombs': Police have resorted to using pyrotechnics (pictured) - dubbed 'bird bombs' - to scare off the crows, which cause health risks to the public from the thousands of droppings they litter across the town .

But despite their efforts, the birds continue to swoop over Sunnyside - which has a population of around 16,000 - on a nightly basis, according to King 5 in Seattle. The crows, which are apparently attracted to the area because they can share food with the thousands of cows in nearby dairy farms, typically appear after 4.30pm. In addition to dropping feces, they also create noise pollution, pose a  risk to the town's electricity services by sitting on power lines and have even attacked residents during nesting season.

Explaining the police's use of pyrotechnicas, Sunnyside Police Commander Scott Bailey told ABC News. 'Basically, it’s a firework inside a pistol shell. We’re simply trying to scare them off.' Cmdr Bailey said the shells - often called 'bird bombs' - offer a non-lethal method to combat the population of crows, which has multiplied dramatically in the past five years. 'We’re dealing with up to 10,000 crows every day,' he said, adding that citizens in the eastern town are warned before officers open fire and rarely complain about the noise. Officer Samuel Ramos told Kima-TV: 'They create a mess. Obviously, it's a problem for the community. It's more humane to push them away than to obviously kill them.' Humane: Officer Samuel Ramos (pictured) said the police's use of pyrotechnics was more beneficial to both the crows and the community, saying: 'It's more humane to push them away than to obviously kill them' Non-lethal gun: Officer Ramos shows off a gun used to fire 'bird bombs' into the sky to scare off the crows . The department, which used to shoot dead the birds, is also hoping to establish a 'tree line' for the crows to gather at, away from the town, within the next five years, Cmdr Bailey said. According to a previous study by the University of Cambridge in England, members of the crow family are among the cleverest birds - and are even smarter than most mammals. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination, to solve similar problems. This means crows can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with.

"Wayne Rooney is now just six strikes shy of equalling Sir Bobby Charlton's England record of 49 goals... but he could be beaten to that mark by own goals! Since 1879 - when Scottish international Robert Parlane scored the first own goal for England at The Oval - a total of 47 have been gifted to the Three Lions. And, if own goals were added to the list of England's record scorers, it would sit third behind only Charlton and Gary Lineker (48). VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney's goal against Estonia perfected in training . Wayne Rooney curls in a free-kick for England's winning goal in Estonia to move to 43 Three Lions strikes . The striker (right) crosses the ball and San Marino's Alex Della Valle deflects it into the net on Thursday, meaning that 47 own goals have now been scored for England . Rooney celebrates with Leighton Baines after finally breaking the deadlock for England in Estonia . 1) Sir Bobby Charlton - 49 goals (106 caps) 2) Gary Lineker - 48 (80 caps) (Own goals - 47) 3) Jimmy Greaves - 44 (57 caps) 4) Wayne Rooney - 43 (99 caps) 5) Michael Owen - 40 (89 caps) 6) Naf Lofthouse - 30 (33 caps) =6) Alan Shearer - 30 (63 caps) =6) Tom Finney - 30 (76 caps) 9) Vivian Woodward - 29 (23 caps) =9) Frank Lampard - 29 (106 caps) Jimmy Greaves is next on the list with 44 - now just one ahead of current captain Rooney (43) following the Manchester United striker's fine free-kick against Estonia on Sunday which gave Roy Hodgson's men victory in Tallinn. The own goals column only needs to record two further strikes to equal Charlton's record and just three more to reach the half-century milestone. And, with the most recent of the own goals having come in England's 5-0 demolition of San Marino on Thursday, it is feasible Rooney may not be the first to reach 50. That own goal - scored by Alex Della Valle - gave the Sammarinese the unwanted title of becoming the first opposition player to score twice for  Three Lions, having previously netted in March 2013. 7 - Wales . 4 - Republic of Ireland, France . 3 - Scotland, Northern Ireland . 2 - Hungary, Norway, Switzerland, Paraguay, Japan, San Marino . 1 - Belgium, USSR, Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg, Egypt, Greece, Australia, Denmark, Portugal, Poland, Jamaica, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Montengro .

"A female member of France’s far-right National Front party has been sent to prison for nine months for comparing the country’s black justice minister to a monkey on Facebook. Anne-Sophie Leclere, a 34-year-old mother of three who was due to be a candidate in local elections this year, must also pay a fine equivalent to almost £30,000, and has been banned from seeking office for five years. Her party immediately condemned a sentence which it believes is among the harshest ever handed down over a social media posting. Anne-Sophie Leclere has been jailed for nine months and fined almost £30,000 for comparing the country¿s black justice minister to a monkey on Facebook . Ms Leclere was standing in Rethel, in the Ardennes region of eastern France, but it was a court in the overseas territory of Cayenne, French Guiana, which found her guilty. The court heard how Ms Leclere published a picture of a baby monkey, with the caption ‘At 18 months’. Next to it was a picture of justice minister Christiane Taubira, 62, above the word: ‘Now’. Justice Minister Christiane Taubira was compared to a monkey by Ms Leclere . During a TV documentary, Ms Leclere . defended her post, insisting Ms Taubira was ‘a savage’, who was ruining . France with her Socialist policies. Ms Leclere . said of Ms Taubira, who was born in French Guiana: ‘Honestly, she’s a . wild animal, coming on TV with that devil’s smile. I’d prefer to see her . swinging from a tree than in government.’ Ms Leclere, who was reported to the police by an anti-racism group in French Guiana, added: ‘I have friends who are black.’ Following the court judgement, she insisted ‘I did not make racist remarks even though my comments on television were clumsy. The . photo was posted on my Facebook page and I took it off a few days . later. I was not the creator of this photograph. I have received several . messages of support,’ she added. A National Front spokesman said the sentence was ‘revolting’ and ‘excessive’, and would appeal. He said: ‘This must be the one of the harshest sentences handed out in long time for freedom of speech.' The . National Front is currently riding high in opinion polls in France, . having won 25 per cent of the popular vote in European elections in May . with its anti-immigration, anti-EU agenda. Its . leader Marine Le Pen has been trying to soften its xenophobic image by . broadening the party’s appeal, and Ms Leclere was one of a number of . women candidates selected to do this.

The wines were offered at a sale in Hong Kong in the first of three auctions and fetched a sale total of £2,269,065. A total of 257 lots were offered and 229 lots were sold. The top lot was one Methuselah - equivalent to eight bottles - of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Vintage 1997 which sold for £94,815. This lot included a card signed 'Best Wishes Alex Ferguson'. Ferguson was known for his good taste in wine, and often enjoyed a post-match glass with his opposing manager during his 26-year reign at Old Trafford. 'My interest in wine began during a scouting trip in France and, over time, my enjoyment of discovery and collecting grew,' said Ferguson. On the run: Di Maria was Real Madrid's standout performer in Lisbon . Time to celebrate: The Argentinean impressed for Madrid as they claimed their 10th European Cup . 'The importance of collecting wine was that it served as a distraction and gave me a balance in my life that helped me in dealing with the intensity and demands required of me as the manager of Manchester United. 'In retirement, I now have the time to visit the places and people that will feed my passion, so I felt it made sense to release a large number of the wines I had collected over the years.

"A St Louis woman was dragged out of her car, attacked and threatened with murder because she is Bosnian, police claim. Officers called in the FBI to investigate the case as a hate crime five days after a Bosnian man was hammered to death nearby. Police said the victim, 26, was driving around a gang of black teenagers at 5.25 on Friday morning when one pulled a gun and ordered her to stop. Scroll down for video . Emotional: The 26-year-old victims parents said they fled the Bosnian war now fear targeted attacks in the city . One struck the windshield with a crowbar and another pulled her out the car. The gang, believed to be all-male, then went through her empty purse and threw her cell phone on the ground, St Louis Post Dispatch reported. They asked where she was from and she said she was European, she claims. 'You're a [expletive] liar,' one man allegedly shouted at the woman. 'You're Bosnian. I should just kill you now'. They then pushed her back to the ground and kicked her. She was found unconscious by passers-by but opted not to go to hospital. Killing: Police said that Zemir Begic was driving in Bevo Mill early Sunday morning when a group of juveniles surrounded his car and began banging on it, beating him when he stepped out of the vehicle . Scene of crime: Flowers at an impromptu memorial to Zemir Begic in South St Louis on Sunday . The reported encounter prompted St Louis police to call the FBI to investigate the case as a hate crime. It comes five days after Zemir Begic, 32, a South City resident of Bosnian descent, was driving home with his newlywed wife at around 1.15am when police say a group of teenagers approached his car and began vandalizing it. Begic emerged from his vehicle to try and stop them, at which point the teenagers allegedly attacked him with hammers, striking him in the head, face and abdomen. The motorist was taken to an area hospital, where he died from his injuries a short time later. His wife escaped unharmed after her husband reportedly shielded her from the attackers with his body. Suspect Robert Mitchell, 17, turned himself in Sunday night after two of his alleged accomplices, ages 15 and 16, were arrested by police, reported St Louis Post-Dispatch. The 17-year-old is being charged as an adult with first-degree murder and armed criminal action.","Gang in St Louis, Missouri, dragged Bosnian woman from car, said: 'You're Bosnian.

"When Oscar the cat went missing, offers from neighbours to help look for him were few and far between. Instead, the atmosphere near his home was one of distinct relief. For the residents of Wingrave, Buckinghamshire, thought they had at last seen the rather aggressive back of the five-year-old Turkish Van they nicknamed ‘Asbo cat’. Oscar is said to have terrorised the . area, attacking dogs and residents. One victim, retired lieutenant . colonel Tom Ridgway, 77, spent six days in hospital after Oscar mauled . his right arm and sank his teeth into his left thumb all the way to the . bone. Watching: Oscar looks out of the window of his house in Wingrave, Bucks . Hungry: Oscar the cat was caught stealing food . But to the regret of Mr Ridgway and his neighbours, Oscar, who vanished on October 17, is now back home – safe and sound. He turned up at an empty house in . Northampton, 25 miles away, and had been muscling in on food put out for . the owners’ pets by a cat sitter. His behaviour was so bad the cat sitter has refused to help out ever again. Determined to get rid of  him, the homeowner had Oscar scanned by a vet, who found the details on his microchip. He arrived back in Wingrave on Saturday – where villagers are arming themselves with water pistols. One, who asked not to be named, admitted many had hoped the only way Oscar would ever return would be ‘in a body bag’. ‘Children can’t walk down the alley to the school,’ said another. ‘They all know about the cat and they are all frightened it’s going to get them.’ Describing Oscar as ‘ferocious’, Mr Ridgway added: ‘He can be very aggressive and will even attack dogs and people around the village.’ Only owner Caroline Hughes, 36, was pleased at the return of Oscar, also known as the ‘Lion Cat of Wingrave’, who she has had since he was a kitten.

She said: ‘When I got the call I asked . “Is he okay and alive?’’ The vet said “He’s very much alive and causing . problems’’. I said “That’s Oscar – he’s okay’’. I am super-happy to . have him back. I never ever gave up but I was definitely starting to . lose faith. Life just wasn’t the same without him. ‘Because of his bad boy antics I . hoped, if he was still okay, he would stay true to form and make himself . known at a house where cats already lived and where somebody would know . what to do rather than get angry with him. ‘It seems ironic now that it was his notorious bad behaviour that brought him back to me.’ But Miss Hughes, a telecoms worker, defended her pet, saying he was so lovable he had even appeared in an Ikea advert in 2010 – and insisted he never attacked children or dogs. ‘The fact that people are saying they want Oscar dead is awful. 'I can’t believe anyone would say that,’ she said. Miss Hughes is now looking into herbal therapy to treat Oscar’s aggression, and is planning to move to a house with a large and secure garden for him to roam. In the meantime, she has put him under house arrest. Vans, originally from Lake Van in the east of modern Turkey, are a powerful breed sometimes referred to as ‘dogs in a cat suit’.

Loyal: Caroline Hughes defended her cat Oscar, claiming he has 'a lot of character' She said she felt like she had to leave home because of the unfair way her neighbours were treating Oscar. She said: 'Oscar has a lot of character. 'He is a lively cat but the accusations some people are making about him are just not true. 'He has never attacked children or dogs. 'Oscar did attack one of my neighbours once but my neighbour had scared him when he tried to pick him up. 'He even appeared in a IKEA TV commercial - so if he was that vicious how on earth would they have filmed him in that. 'The fact that people are saying they want Oscar dead is just awful - I can't believe anyone would say that. 'He is a great cat - it has all got too much and I think I am going to have to move home.'

"A British Airways jet was forced to make an emergency landing after two women pilots 'almost passed out' at the controls. The captain and first officer had to put on oxygen masks as the . aircraft, which had just taken off from Heathrow, was climbing at 20,000 . feet. Twenty minutes into the . Glasgow-bound flight, passengers heard a 'panicked' call for a senior . member of the cabin crew to come to the aid . of the flight crew 'immediately'. The plane, an Airbus A321, was heading to Glasgow when both pilots reported feeling unwell . Passengers saw 'worried' air stewards . carrying oxygen cylinders as the plane turned around and headed full . speed back to Heathrow. One . passenger, a 40-year-old health and safety manager, said: 'I know we flew back much faster than we had set off because we began descending sharply almost straight away. 'A lot of . stewards were moving about. You could tell they had a lot on their . plate, with this happening so soon into the flight.' The Airbus A321, which was carrying more than 100 passengers, landed safely back at Heathrow on December 20 and was met by around 10 fire engines and two ambulances. Bewildered travellers were told only that they were heading back 'due to a technical fault'. One frightened elderly passenger had to be attended to by staff as the emergency return began. Dramatic escape: Passengers were rushed back to Heathrow after both the Captain and first officer became dizzy and light-headed during the ascent (file photo) British airlines have been hit by toxic fume leaks at a rate of five flights a week unbeknown to passengers, figures revealed at the end of last year. The Civil Aviation Authority  received 254 reports of problems in the cabin or cockpit in the 12-month period before. The data logs emergency landings, distress calls and incidents where cabin crew have had to wear oxygen masks. The dossier was released as plane manufacturer Boeing agreed an undisclosed payout to former flight attendant, Terry Williams for her exposure to contaminated air. The mother-of-two said she suffered memory loss, and speech and vision impairment after toxic air leaked into the cabin of an American Airlines plane in 2007. The CAA also reveals emergency landings after crew have fallen ill. Cabin air on most aircraft is supplied unfiltered through the outside engine system. It can be contaminated by an oil leak, which leads to pungent smells that can cause headaches, nausea or even unconsciousness. The Department for Transport has denied claims that the CAA dossier should cause concerns for people on board flights. The incident, which is . now being investigated by the Air Accident Investigation Branch, was . also reported on a professional pilots' website. One user wrote: 'Departed Heathrow at 4 . pm-ish, at approx 20 mins into flight a very abrupt and . panicked message came over the PA from the pilot.' He said there were a . number of 'worried faces' among the flight attendants he saw with . oxygen cylinders and said the plane headed back to Heathrow . 'at great speed'. 'No announcement for a long time then the . expected technical problem line was posted to all,' he added. 'We landed no problem . but were met by a full fire service turn out, including local authority . fire service and engineers etc etc. 'It later transpires that both pilots became lightheaded/dizzy/unwell at the same time, in my book that's serious.' Paramedics boarded the plane first . and passengers discovered that both pilots had felt as though they . had been about to pass . out. The 40-year-old health and safety manager said: 'That moment was very . alarming, and I travel by air all the time. I take my hat off to the stewards for being so calm and . collected.

"Water vapour has been detected in the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years - or 729 trillion miles - from Earth. The planet is about the size of the gas giant Neptune, and is the smallest and coldest outside the solar system known to contain H2O molecules - the building blocks of life. Scientists claim the discovery is a leap forward in the study of distant exoplanets that may in future uncover evidence of alien life. Water vapour has been detected in the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years  from Earth. The planet, HAT-P-11 b, is about the size of  Neptune and is the smallest outside the solar system known to contain H2O molecules. Pictured is a comparison in size between the exoplanet HAT-P-11 b (left) and Neptune . Researchers used a technique called transmission spectroscopy, which measures dips in light as the planet passes in front of its host star to identify the signs of water vapour. Previously it has only been possible to measure the atmospheric compositions of larger Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets. Scientists believe this planet - known as HAT-P-11b - is too close to its host star with a temperature of about 600°C (1,112°F) for even the most primitive microbes to develop. They suggest it may have a rocky core wrapped in a thick hydrogen gas and atmosphere is cloudless at high altitude. Researchers used a technique called transmission spectroscopy which measures dips in light as the planet passes in front of its host star to identify the signs of water vapour (illustration shown) The water vapour was detected using data picked up by Nasa's Hubble and Spitzer (artist's impression pictured) telescopes. Scientists claim the discovery is a leap forward in the study of distant exoplanets that may in future uncover evidence of alien life . However, the data picked up by Nasa's Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes shows it also contains the signature of water vapour. Last month, scientists announced that they might have found water clouds beyond the solar system for the first time. The discovery was made on a brown dwarf, a gas giant planet that failed to become a star, 7.3 light-years from Earth. If true, the sighting would be an important step to finding habitable planets like our own in the future. The finding was announced by a team led by Dr Jacqueline Faherty of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC. The object in question is the coldest brown dwarf ever found, WISE J0855-0714, with a temperature between -48 and -13°C (-55 and 8°F). To make the discovery, Dr Faherty combined 151 near-infrared images of the world using the Magellan Baade telescope in Chile. This revealed that the colour of the gas giant matches the predicted models of a brown dwarf with clouds of water ice in its atmosphere. While water vapour has been spotted in exoplanets before, this is the first time water clouds have been spotted. It’s thought that as much as half of the planet is obscured by clouds, making it a partly cloudy world like Earth. Even in our own solar system, the only water clouds known of are on Earth and Mars; for the giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, they are too cold and ammonia ice clouds cover suspected water clouds below. Professor Drake Deming, an expert in the study of 'exoplanets' that orbit suns outside our solar system, said water is a precondition for life - although its presence alone is not enough. 'The water molecule is widespread in the universe. Wherever you have hydrogen and oxygen it naturally forms,' he said. 'Even some sun spots are cool enough to contain water vapour - although obviously it's far too hot for life on the sun.' Astronomers also want to test the idea other planets formed the same way ours did. In the primordial solar system, particles of dust and ice carried native electrical charges that caused them to stick together. Early in this process, the giant planets that formed far from the sun had enough gravitational pull to attract large amounts of hydrogen gas. But water freezes out of the atmospheres of our solar system's giant planets where it occurs only at deep levels that are difficult to observe. The closer-in smaller planets such as Mars, Venus and Earth had water early in their evolution - although only Earth retains liquid water at the surface. The smaller the planet the more likely it is that heavier molecules like water vapour will be abundant along with hydrogen. Professor Deming, of Maryland University, said: 'Our ideas about the formation of planets have been developed to match our solar system and we don't know whether other planetary systems behave the same way. 'We want to test the fundamental question of whether small planets are rich in heavy elements - like the oxygen in water vapour.' He said the discovery of water vapour and hydrogen on HAT P-11b 'is a key piece of the puzzle' - consistent with astronomers' main ideas on the formation of planets. Professor Eliza Kempton, a physicist at Grinnell College in Iowa who reviewed the study for the journal, added: 'The first definitive signs of water have been seen in the atmosphere of a Neptune-sized exoplanet - paving the way towards the search for water on smaller Earth-like planets.' Scientists believe this planet - known as HAT-P-11b - is too close to its host star with a temperature of about 600°C for even the most primitive microbes to develop.

"Fired regulator: Carmen Segarra, 41, filed a federal lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, saying she was sacked for refusing to change the results of her investigation into Goldman Sachs . A former employee has sued the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, saying she was wrongfully terminated because she refused to change the results of her investigation into Goldman Sachs. Carmen Segarra, 41, filed her federal lawsuit against the New York Fed Thursday in Manhattan. Segarra's lawsuit said the New York Fed interfered with her examination of Goldman Sach's legal and compliance divisions and directed her to change her findings. She said she refused and was fired three days later, in May 2012. The Harvard, Columbia, Sorbonne and Cornell University-educated compliance officer said that in her seven months of examining Goldman, she found the bank did not have policies to prevent conflicts of interest as required by regulation. The firing caused Segarra’s career in banking to be ‘irreparably damaged,’ stated her lawsuit, which seeks her reinstatement to her position as senior bank examiner, back pay, compensation for lost benefits, compensatory damages, attorney's fees and other expenses. Segarra's finding led to the New York Fed's Legal and Compliance risk team to approve downgrading Goldman's annual rating pertaining to policies and procedures, the lawsuit said. It's not clear if the approval led to an actual rate change, but the lawsuit, the threat of one startled Michael Silva, who oversees the New York Fed's relationship with Goldman, and Silva's deputy, Michael Koh. Red flag: Segarra's finding led to the New York Fed's Legal and Compliance risk team to approve downgrading Goldman's annual rating pertaining to policies and procedures . Under scrutiny: Segarra, formerly a legal counsel at Societe Generale, Citi and Bank of America, was assigned to Goldman Sach's legal and compliance divisions from October 2011 until May 2012, looking into conflict-of-interest policies . The two officials were concerned that a downgrade could cause clients to stop doing business with the Wall Street bank, the lawsuit said. Silva and Koh are named as defendants in Segarra's lawsuit, as is her former supervisor, Johnathon J. Kim. Segarra stated in her federal complaint cited by Bloomberg Businessweek that in a meeting, Silva said the Fed 'possessed information about Goldman that could cause Goldman to ‘explode.' A spokesman for the New York Fed declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit but said its personnel decisions ‘are based exclusively on individual job performance and are subject to thorough review.’ ‘We categorically reject any suggestions to the contrary,’ spokesman Jack Gutt said. Trio in trouble: Segarra's lawsuit names as defendants Michael Silva (left), who oversees the New York Fed's relationship with Goldman, his deputy, Michael Koh (center), and the fired regulator's former supervisor, Johnathon J. Kim (right) Goldman Sachs said it had no knowledge of internal Fed discussions ‘nor the matters raised by Ms. Segarra.’ ‘Goldman Sachs has a comprehensive approach to addressing conflicts through firmwide and divisional policies and infrastructure,’ Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally said. Segarra, formerly a legal counsel at Societe Generale, Citigroup and Bank of America, was assigned to Goldman's legal and compliance divisions from October 2011 until May 2012, and looked into three controversial transactions related to Solyndra, Capmark and the merger of El Paso and Kinder Morgan. At that point, Kim, Silva and Koh fired her and had her escorted from the building by security guards after weeks of disputes and pressure to change her examination findings, the lawsuit said. Segarra's lawyer, Linda Stengle, said in an interview that Goldman's committees and standards represented ‘a paper policy that didn't really have any weight.’ Career in shambles: Segarra's suit claims that her firing caused her career in banking to be 'irreparably damaged' Stengle said that Goldman executives in charge of conflicts told Segarra and other Fed examiners that they did not have a firmwide conflicts policy and also gave inconsistent statements about the conflicts board's duties and findings. ‘Bank examiners should be able to operate without fear of retaliation against the banks that they're examining,’ said Stengle. Instead, she said her client was ‘cornered’ by supervisors who ‘tried to force her or persuade her very heavily to change her findings.’","Carmen Segarra, 41, was fired by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2012 after completing a seven-month investigation into Goldman Sachs .

"Real Madrid legend Jorge Valdano has launched a scathing attack on Jose Mourinho, saying the Chelsea manager has an 'ego' and has never said anything about football 'worth remembering'. The former Real director, who clashed with Mourinho during his time in charge at the Bernabeu, also claimed the 'Special One' was vastly inferior to Pep Guardiola.

"The original Ronaldo has taken to playing poker, which might explain why he is willing to take a punt on such a weak hand. With the waiting nearly over, one of the World Cup greats is weighing up the contenders. He mentions Brazil. Then he mentions pressure and Neymar. One of the most fascinating sub-plots of a magnificently open competition will be how that 22-year-old deals with the demands of his country. As Ronaldo knows, Brazilian strikers don’t carry light loads. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Ronaldo being double bluffed by Bebeto . Are you sure? Brazil's Ronaldo believes that England have a chance of winning the 2014 World Cup . Gotcha! Ronaldo was tricked by his former World Cup teammate Bebeto (R) Then Ronaldo mentions England. In this summer of muted hopes, it may be the first prediction from any major footballing figure outside Roy Hodgson’s squad. Ronaldo wants to throw some chips down. ‘You never know in football,’ he says. ‘Over the years the sport has shown us great examples of this so you cannot say a team are not potential winners. England should definitely be considered, they can surprise us. Uruguay are very good but Brazil, Germany, Argentina and Spain are the strongest.’ For Ronaldo, it’s nice to talk about football. He is the ambassador who is not a politician. Not in the sense that Romario is, his immediate predecessor in Brazil’s list of great strikers. The two men don’t get on  terribly well these days. Their spats over the past year of organisational chaos have become something of a feature. Hope: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored in a shock friendly 2-2 against Brazil at the Maracana, June 2013 . While Romario, the star of Brazil’s 1994 win, has turned to politics and been one of the loudest critics of the country’s prioritisation of football over social policies, Ronaldo, the inspiration of their 2002 triumph, has been one of the event’s major cheerleaders. While Romario has focused on the serious issues, Ronaldo has largely wanted to talk football and the glorious unpredictability of this World Cup, one where Brazil may be challenged by the little man called Lionel who lives next door. The potential exists for a great event and it also allows room for an enormous capitulation, such is the expectation in Brazil for a sixth World Cup win. Great expectations: The pressure will be on Brazil's next brightest star Neymar at the World Cup . It is a pressure that could become relevant, according to a man who won one final, was an unused substitute in another and was central to the mother of all pre-final scandals in 1998. ‘Brazil has a great chance,’ Ronaldo said. ‘We played in the Confederations Cup and demonstrated what we can do (with a 3-0 demolition of Spain in the final). We have a solid defence, a midfield that battles very hard and great goalscorers. ‘We are at home and have an exceptional player in Neymar. The pressure will be greater than normal but the fans’ support will spur the team on. German engineering: Miroslav Klose could beat Ronaldo's goal scoring record of 15 goals . There is also the small matter of Ronaldo’s record of 15 World Cup goals which could be taken by Miroslav Klose, that most un-Brazilian of German strikers. ‘I am very proud of that record but records are there to be broken,’ Ronaldo added. ‘It would be nice to keep it for a while longer but I am cheering for someone to break the record. It will be good for the sport.’ So would an England triumph, but that seems an altogether riskier bet. One of the most prestigious World Cup records will be there for the taking when Miroslav Klose resumes his brilliant relationship with the event. In the past three editions he has amassed 14 goals, and will overtake Ronaldo’s record if he nets twice in Brazil. He is the man who has often come close, but not gone close enough. He is the Lazio striker who is not a star. His nickname is Miro and his game is no more flamboyant. His notable World Cup record is that he is the only man to score five headers in a single competition. Nice, but not nice enough for many billboards. Yet this is a numbers game. And in a game of international numbers Klose is a superstar. Klose has been steady for his clubs, but 206 goals in 524 games is not the stuff of legends. However, on the international stage he is a machine. Aged 35, he is level with Gerd Muller on 68 goals for Germany. Where they differ is that when Klose scores for Germany they never lose. That might bode well this summer for Germany and the modest man who does so much to make them shine.","Brazilian Ronaldo believes that England could win the 2014 World Cup .

"Ellie with Stacey the orphaned wombat . He's a tiny, bright-eyed bundle of grey fluff enveloped in fleecy blankets, clutching a battered soft toy in place of his mother. Meet Danny the koala – the youngest and most vulnerable orphan at Cape Otway Conservation Ecology Centre in southern Australia. Countryfile presenter Ellie Harrison's breath is quite taken away as she settles little Danny in her arms. His tiny face looks into hers and then towards the camera. You can almost see him smile. He is, quite simply, one of the cutest animals ever to grace a television screen. 'Danny's so loveable because he's just like a baby teddy bear,' says Ellie. 'He's so tiny. He's just sublime. Everyone is going to fall in love with koalas once they've seen him.' The 36-year-old flew Down Under to film the two-part Nature's Miracle Orphans, in which she meets animals who've lost their mothers in traffic accidents, dog attacks and other tragedies. The charismatic cast includes koalas, wallabies, kangaroos and wombats, as well as anteaters and sloths in Costa Rica, visited by Ellie's co-host Max Hug Williams. The other stars are the human foster mums dedicated to saving the animals and reintroducing them to the wild – and cuddling is vital to survival. With marsupials such as kangaroos, the babies, called joeys, spend their first six to nine months in their mother's pouch feeding and growing, which forges an incredibly deep bond. The orphaned joeys' need for contact is so great that carers must provide it simply to keep them alive. 'Wallabies and kangaroos are known as heart-breakers to the staff because they're very difficult to keep alive,' Ellie explains. 'The stress of being separated from their mothers takes a huge toll on their physiology.' Stella Reid of Wildhaven Wildlife Shelter, near Melbourne, has a cot in her bedroom for her youngest charges. Its current occupant is Neil the swamp wallaby – five weeks old when his mum was hit by a car. He survived, cushioned by her body, and was plucked from her pouch. When he cries at night, Stella holds Neil in his cloth pouch so he can hear the sound of her heart, as he would have done in his mother's pouch. When he's stronger, he'll be paired with other wallabies to get used to life in a group. Danny the orphaned Koala with his look-a-like teddy . Stella tips Neil out of his pouch occasionally – like his mother would have – so he learns to stand on his own two feet. Eventually, he'll bounce along at up to 30mph but right now, staying upright is tricky enough. The wobbly wallaby leans on Ellie's hand, but still inadvertently reenacts Bambi on ice. 'It was surreal, charming and highly amusing,' Ellie says. 'It was like a human baby learning to walk: that trust, the need to hold on and the tentative nature of those first steps. They tire quickly and fall over. It's wonderful to see. You'd have to be on a stakeout for months in the wild to see that.' The charismatic cast includes koalas, wallabies, kangaroos and wombats, as well as anteaters and sloths in Costa Rica . Like Neil, Danny the koala was found by the road. Terribly weak, he ran up the leg of the motorist who stopped to rescue him. He's bottle-fed every two hours and will be looked after for at least a year – first indoors, then in an enclosure where he'll learn to climb trees. After that, the bush beckons. Charming as he is, Danny isn't the orphan who touched Ellie's heart most, though. 'That was probably Stacey the wombat,' the presenter admits. 'She had a great character. Wombats do. They're known as the bulldozers of the bush and are quite confident. Stacey charged about the house head-butting and knocking things over. She had to be taken for walks in the garden to get her used to the outside. She follows sound, so you'd walk away and stamp your feet and she'd come charging after you, bound into your legs and start investigating.' What surprised Ellie most, though, was the extent to which the carers were prepared to sacrifice their lives. 'They've dedicated their lives to caring for these orphans,' she says. 'They'll be woken through the night and don't get paid. All this care goes into one animal, and then they have to send it out into the wild not knowing how it's going to cope. But you know the likelihood of them surviving otherwise would've been virtually zero.' Nature's Miracle Orphans, later this month, BBC1.","The 36-year-old goes to Australia for a new series .

"Even by football’s frenetic standards, the rise of Raheem Sterling from problem child to national treasure in under 12 months has been rapid, just like his acceleration on the pitch. A year ago this weekend, he was a late substitute for Victor Moses in Liverpool’s 2-2 draw at Swansea City, still to be entrusted by manager Brendan Rodgers as a regular first-teamer. Today, it’s a vastly different story. He is Liverpool’s go-to man following the departure of Luis Suarez. The undisputed centre of attention at Anfield for Saturday’s tea-time kick-off against Aston Villa. Raheem Sterling has scored two goals in three games already for Liverpool so far this season . Raheem Sterling slots home to give Liverpool the lead against Tottenham, a game they won 3-0 . Raheem Sterling scored Liverpool's first goal in their 2-1 win over Southampton on the opening day . Raheem Sterling promotes The Sims 4 . Sterling is also the major cause for optimism about England’s future. Still only 19 but with plenty of life experience already behind him — he is already a father — Sterling puts his fantastic form down to a conscious decision to be less inhibited on the pitch. ‘Maybe 12 months ago, I wouldn’t want to get on the ball as much if I’d made a mistake. But now I’m a bit more confident,’ he says. ‘If I lose the ball I want to get on it as quickly as possible and make up for it, whereas before I would hide away and maybe only look for the ball 10 minutes later. I don’t want to give the defenders any break. ‘I sat down with my agent and went through my youth-team video footage. I saw that when I started, I’d get on the ball and within two touches would turn straight away and look to attack my opponent, but when I got into the first team, I would go for the safer option. So I went back to basics where I needed to be on the front foot and the defenders on the back foot.’ In the flesh, you are quickly reminded this is still a kid, albeit one who has had an eventful journey to this point. At our interview at Aintree racecourse to promote EA computer game The Sims 4, he appears nonplussed by the sudden wave of love being thrown in his direction. Raheem Sterling was one of few positives for England at their miserable World Cup campaign . Raheem Sterling slots home one of his two goals against Arsenal at Anfield last season . This is a lad who left his birthplace of Kingston, Jamaica, to live in England at the age of five. Growing up on a tough north-west London estate overlooked by Wembley stadium, his mum took him to play his first organised football game at the age of 10, essentially to keep him out of trouble. One teacher told him starkly he’d either become a star footballer or end up in prison. At 15, he took the biggest decision of his life, to leave QPR for Liverpool and get him away from the malignant influences in London. Regular goalscoring is his next challenge and two in his first three games of the season for Liverpool suggests he’ll crack that too. Pushed to explain why his development has been so meteoric, he also points to a meeting with Rodgers around this time last year. He’d just been cleared at Liverpool crown court of assaulting a former girlfriend when the Liverpool boss stated privately and publicly he needed ‘stability in his life’. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and Raheem Sterling talk during a training session at Melwood . Sterling took a good look at himself, decided to stop going out every time friends asked and dedicated himself to being a professional. In December, he started to be given a run of games. He was unplayable when he scored twice in a 5-1 win against Arsenal in February. By the end of the season, his performances were regularly eclipsing Suarez and he was the only England player to return from the World Cup with his reputation enhanced. ‘Going into training each day, coming home and going back to training. That’s been it for me over the last 12 months,’ he says. ‘I have tried to live, sleep and eat football as the manager has told me to do. ‘When the time is right, I have a laugh and a joke with my friends on a day off, but I have had to make sacrifices and in that sense it’s been a huge step forward, completely different to how it was before. I was 18 when the manager spoke to me. I realised I’m not like any other teenager. I can’t be doing stuff any other 18 or 19-year-old was doing. I knew I had to make changes, to ensure being the best I could be.’ Surprisingly, and a little unconvincingly, Sterling insists he is not a naturally confident person. By that he probably means he would rather let others talk him up rather than do it himself. Brendan Rodgers told Raheem Sterling that he needed stability in his life and to focus on football . Raheem Sterling and Luis Suarez celebrate during a game against Norwich last season . ‘I am not saying I don’t think I’m good, but I’m not the type of player to have an ego or big myself up. ‘It’s been a quick turnaround for my career but that is football. It changes within seconds. I am now focusing on going to the next level. I’m determined it is only a matter of time before I get there.’ It says a lot for his growing maturity that both Rodgers and Roy Hodgson trust him to play at No 10, arguably the most important position on the pitch. Gareth Bale, for example, was much older before he was switched inside from the wing. ‘I prefer the No 10 position, but I’m still developing and not quite the complete player to play there. ‘Every time I get in there I try to take the responsibility of creating and scoring goals. I enjoy that.’ Hodgson must agree. He devised a diamond system for England’s crunch game in Basle specifically to get Sterling on the ball as much as possible. There will be a chance to compare Sterling’s progress with Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo when Liverpool play Real Madrid in the Champions League. Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and their Real Madrid team-mates train in the Spanish capital . ‘Ronaldo has always been an idol to me,’ says Sterling. ‘But I’m not going to say any more because every time I mention a name, people say I’m comparing myself to them! Everyone wants to be like the best in the world.’ While Sterling keeps social activity to a minimum these days — ‘I’m not really a drinker’ — he does allow himself one ‘vice’, social media. ‘Why am I on Twitter? Well, I am 19 and need something to get away from football sometimes,’ he smiles. ‘It’s a way of having a laugh and a joke with my friends. You scroll past the provocative messages if they come in.’ Rodgers will be happy for him to carry on tweeting at least as long as England’s most talented teenager carries on with his otherwise ‘boring’ life of home-training ground-home.

"A group of college students under federal investigation for doing the 'Harlem Shake' on an airplane say their flight attendants not only gave them permission to jump in the aisles mid-flight but helped them. Sophomore Colorado College student Matt Zalin said the Frontier Airlines attendants were 'genuinely very excited' when asked if the entire flight from Denver to San Diego could get up and perform the rambunctious dance in an interview with Today. 'We talked to the flight attendants the whole time and we were really aware of whatever they were telling us was OK and what they were telling us wasn't OK,' student Conor Crowley said. Scroll down for video . Freaky dancing: The video starts with a signature lone dancer in the aisle of the plane . Suddenly everyone is dancing including one guy dressed as a banana and another person wearing an Abraham Lincoln mask . They say they weren't sure if the pilot was aware of their activity behind the cockpit but say, 'I would assume so, it is his flight, but I really can't speak for him.' In a statement from Frontier Airlines to Today, the company defended itself saying: 'We have a policy not to comment on things that are under investigation by the FAA, but I can tell you that all safety measures were followed and the seat belt sign was off.' Asked if the students had any hesitation over safety - being thousands of feet in the air and not knowing how other passengers would handle it - all three said no. '...we really were in touch with everybody so if something was going wrong with someone we would have been ready for it and the flight attendants were in on this, it wasn't the kind of thing that it was just happening,' Gavin Nachbar said. The PA system was also said to have been . provided to communicate with all of the passengers to make sure they understand what was about to happen. No regrets: Gavin Nachbar, left, Conor Crowley, center, Matt Zelin, right are the members of a college Ultimate Frisbee team under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration . 'For us, it was never about anything but trying to have fun,' said Mr Nachbar . As for reaction to the investigation now launched by the Federal Aviation Administration the students say they still have no regrets. While the video has gone viral with more than 450,000 views on YouTube, safety experts have voiced concerns that the prank unnecessarily put the entire plane in jeopardy. The flash mob was organized by the three members of the Colorado College Ultimate Frisbee Team who were on their way to a tournament in San Diego over President's Day weekend. Somehow they managed to convince fellow passengers of all ages to get up and pump their fists to the dance tune by DJ Baauer. The video starts with a signature lone dancer in the aisle of the plane. As the beat rises to a crescendo, almost all of the plane's passengers join the freaky dancing, including one guy dressed as a banana and another person wearing an Abraham Lincoln mask. Spokesman Allen Kenitzer confirmed on Thursday that the FAA is investigating and are particularly keen to confirm what phase the flight was in during the dancing in the aisles. Young and old are involved in the flash mob including this small boy . According to aviation expert Glen Winn, carrying out such a prank at 30,000 feet raises safety concerns and isn’t advisable. ‘It's evident to me that one, the crew lost control in the cabin… I'm just amazed the crew let this happen,’ he told 10News. Winn said there were several serious safety concerns for those on the plane, including loss of pressurization. ‘You have a weight and balance issue because that many people moving around in an aircraft, you could have the plane potentially losing control and its very, very dangerous,’ he said. The video was shot by Mr Zelin who claims they didn’t do anything wrong and had checked with staff before carrying out the prank. ‘I don't see there being any reason why this should cause any trouble.

"Didier Drogba has asked for patience in his bid to show some of his former brilliance after returning to Chelsea. The 36-year-old missed last Saturday's Premier League defeat of Swansea with an ankle problem, but was thrust into the starting line-up for Wednesday night's Champions League clash with Schalke. Drogba was unable to add to his 157 Blues goals - accrued over eight years, from 2004 to 2012 - and Chelsea were punished as the Germans claimed a 1-1 draw. Chelsea striker Didier Drogba says he need time to get back to the level Blues fans are used to . The Stamford Bridge legend is desperate to add to the 157 Chelsea goals he scored between 2004 and 2012 . 'For a first game I felt okay, kind of okay,' Drogba, who left Stamford Bridge after scoring the decisive penalty in the 2012 European Cup win, told Chelsea TV. 'The good thing is no pain in the ankle, so now I can start working and training and improve the condition. 'I was feeling much better in the second half. I'm like a diesel, I need time.' After missing two easy chances against Schalke on Wednesday, Drogba was taken off for Diego Costa . Drogba twice was unable to convert what would once have been meat and drink to him, firstly when Willian crossed inside the six-yard box and then when Eden Hazard played him in. Drogba added: 'I had (chances), especially the one in the second half. It was a clear chance and I think it's unlucky. 'If I score there there's no more game. The fact that you don't score, they still believe in the equaliser and that's what happened afterwards.'

"Matt Prior is close to walking again after discovering a potential career-ending injury just this month. The wicketkeeper, who has seen his spot in the England side passed on to Jos Buttler, underwent an operation to rectify an achilles problem that became altogether more serious. Prior's surgeon found a worrying three-inch tear through the middle of his tendon. Matt Prior tweeted a scar of his Achilles injury that was worse than the surgeon first feared .

"Baby boys born in winter are more likely to be left-handed than those born in summer, new research suggests . Baby boys born in winter are more likely to be left-handed than those born in summer, new research suggests. Psychologists at the University of Vienna studied 13,000 adults and found that overall, 7.5 per cent of women and 8.8 per cent of men were left-handed. But they found that among the men, on a monthly average, 8.2 per cent of the left-handers were born during the period  February to October. Yet during November to January, this number rose to 10.5 per cent. The researchers said their findings, which were published in the scientific journal Cortex, backed the theory that left-handedness in men could have a hormonal cause. It’s thought that an embryo’s exposure to higher levels of the male hormone testosterone in the womb increases their chances of being left-handed. More daylight may increase testosterone levels, and as baby boys born in the winter are in the embryonic stage during the spring and summer, they may be exposed to more testosterone. Lead author of the study, Ulrich Tran, said: ‘Presumably, the relative darkness during the period November to January is not directly connected to this birth seasonality of handedness. ‘We assume that the relative brightness during the period May to July, half a year before, is its distal cause.’ The effect is explained for men, but not women, because male brains are exposed to substantially higher testosterone levels than female brains during prenatal development. The Geschwind-Galaburda hypothesis, . named after the neurologists who devised the theory, suggests that . testosterone delays the maturation of the left brain hemisphere during . embryonic development. Psychologists at the University of Vienna said their findings backed the theory that left-handedness in men could have a hormonal cause. More daylight may increase testosterone levels, and as baby boys born in the winter are in the embryonic stage during the spring and summer, they may be exposed to more testosterone . The left brain hemisphere is dominant among right-handers, while the right brain hemisphere is dominant among left-handers. In-womb levels of testosterone are higher in the male foetus, because of its own testosterone secretion, than in the female foetus. However, the testosterone level of the mother and external factors may also affect levels of the hormone in the womb. Specifically, more daylight may increase testosterone levels, making a seasonality effect plausible.","Psychologists at the University of Vienna found baby boys born in the period October to February were more likely to be left-handed .

"Mathieu Debuchy is expected to be out for two months after suffering an ankle injury in Saturday's draw with Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium. Debuchy collapsed in clear agony after catching his studs in the turf and the defender has damaged ligaments in his left ankle. The 29-year-old's injury means Arsene Wenger will bring Calum Chambers, the only back-up centre-half, in at right back. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger on Mathieu Debuchy injury . Arsenal defender Mathieu Debuchy screams in pain after injuring his ankle against Manchester City .

Other defenders in the senior squad are left back Kieran Gibbs, just back from injury, and 19-year-old right back Hector Bellerin, yet to make a competitive start for Arsenal. Wenger admitted Debuchy’s injury, in the 81st minute, hurt his team against City, who grabbed a point through Martin Demichelis's header two minutes later. 'We just switched off,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We did not look the same team. Not because of Chambers but we looked a bit lost.' Calum Chambers (right) will be needed to plug the gap at right back for Wenger . Debuchy joined Arsenal in the summer as a replacement for Bacary Sagna, who left to play for City, and had impressed with his performances so far at the Emirates. Arsenal were on track for victory against City after man-of-the-match Jack Wilshere inspired a second-half fightback, firing a wonderful equaliser before teeing up Alexis Sanchez’s sublime volley.

"Mr Justice Holman ruled that - although the girl was under extreme duress and aged under 16 at the time - he was barred by statute from voiding the marriage . A judge says he cannot nullify the marriage of a teenage mother who says she was forced at 'gunpoint' into becoming a bride when she was just 14. Instead the girl, now 17 and a mother of a one-year-old, must defy her family if she wants the union formally annulled, said Mr Justice Holman at the High Court. The teenager, who was born in Britain and whose family has lived here for 40 years, says she was shipped out to Pakistan to contract a forced marriage with a 24-year-old man two years ago. She told how she was subjected to 'harrowing' violence and menaced with a gun to go through with the ceremony - and was two weeks later forced to have sex with her ‘husband’, giving birth to his baby who is now aged just over one. After she came forward with her account, her local authority took both her and her baby into care and asked Mr Justice Holman to formally declare that her marriage - which effectively made her a rape victim - could never have been recognised under English law. However, in a unique decision, the judge ruled that - although the girl was under extreme duress and aged under 16 at the time - he was barred by statute from granting a declaration that her marriage was 'at its inception, void'. Expressing sympathy for the girl and the 'real stigma' she faced, the judge said his hands were tied and he simply had no power to make a formal ruling that 'there never was a marriage' capable of recognition in England and Wales. Despite the council’s plea that the girl should not be forced to take 'an active step' in defiance of her family, the judge said her only option was to launch court action herself, seeking nullification of her marriage. Whether she wanted to take that course was 'her own decision', he told the court. Mr Justice Holman said it was, according to the girl’s account, a 'grave example of a marriage which was forced under considerable duress, involving at one stage the production of a gun and physical violence upon the girl'. Her father, who moved to the UK 40 years ago and has been a British citizen for three decades, and her older brother had accompanied her on the trip to Pakistan, which culminated in her becoming an unwilling bride. The teenager told how she was subjected to 'harrowing' violence and menaced with a gun to go through with the ceremony. File picture . The judge added: 'The marriage was consummated about two weeks later, after further threats to her if she did not permit her husband to have sexual intercourse with her.' The girl’s barrister, Vanessa Meachin, said: 'She is the victim of forced marriage and rape. She is 17 and struggling with the complexities of the two sets of legal proceedings that she is already involved in. 'It is unrealistic to consider that she is presently equipped to proceed with a petition for nullity.' Mr Justice Holman accepted that - as the girl was 'domiciled' in the UK; had been put under duress; and, most importantly, was under 16 at the time of the ceremony - the marriage was 'on the balance of probability, void' under English law. However, he said he was prevented from making a solemn declaration to that effect by a section of the Family Law Act 1986, which states: 'No declaration may be made by any court...that a marriage was at its inception void'. - Barrister Vanessa Meachin . If he were to grant the declaration sought by the local authority, the judge said he would 'frankly, be bypassing the statutory prohibition by a mere device. I cannot do that and I am not prepared to do that'. He added: 'I do understand and have sympathy with the point and position that it might be particularly defiant by the girl of her family for herself to initiate proceedings for a decree of nullity, although she now has little contact with most members of her family. 'The reality is that, sooner or later, she needs fully to resolve her legal status and to face up to the obviously necessary step of obtaining a decree of nullity. 'That, however, is a matter for her own decision, her own timing, and her own choice. For the reasons that I have now given, I simply refuse to make the order sought.' The court earlier heard that the girl’s ‘husband’ was not named on her baby’s birth certificate and his whereabouts are unknown. However, he still has the rights of a ‘putative or non-marital father’ and could conceivably play a part in the care proceedings.","Top family judge says he cannot void marriage of girl forced to wed at 14 .

"Manuel Pellegrini had a point when complaining about refereeing decisions which cost Manchester City in their 2-2 with Arsenal but Mark Clattenburg can’t be blamed for all of them. Those who don’t think video replays will help football should review the incident when Jack Wilshere handled the ball inside his own penalty area. Whilst some might try and argue that Wilshere’s arm is down by his side in a natural position, there is clear movement of it towards the ball in a deliberate way but Clattenburg and his colleagues had obstructed views and so just could not award the penalty that City deserved. VIDEOS scroll down to watch . Jack Wilshere appeared to handle the ball in the area when City were 1-0 up incensing Manuel Pellegrini . Jack Wilshere celebrates levelling for Arsenal against Manchester during the second half . A video replay would have enabled them to award the penalty which City deserved and will help when a referee is unsighted. The same could not be said of Danny Welbeck’s nudge on Vincent Kompany which meant the City captain didn’t get a clean header away and enabled Arsenal to rebuild their attack and feed the ball through for Alexis Sanchez to score.

I can only assume that Clattenburg was watching the area from where the cross came rather than the central area as he couldn’t have missed the nudge had he been looking. The other complaints about a foul in the build up to Arsenal’s first goal and the fact that Clattenburg ‘had a very, very bad day’ revealed a deeper lying issue between the manager of the champions and England’s leading referee. Pelligrini has an issue with Clattenburg which goes back over a number of games. He truly believes that Clattenburg appears to be consistently going against his team. The Chilean is not a manager who plays mind games so this is a genuine belief which he must resolve in his mind and perhaps a meeting would be beneficial between the two. Diego Costa is a superb centre forward who plays like an old fashioned ‘English’ target man. He is no lightweight ‘soft’ foreigner and was incorrectly cautioned in his first game for ‘diving’. There was evidence of the more robust nature of Costa’s play when he pushed Swansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson away strongly after he was being held on the edge of the penalty area. Perhaps he could have been cautioned had Kevin Friend been slavish to law, but there was nothing I saw to suggest he was fortunate not to be sent off and not being cautioned perhaps ‘levelled things up’ after his first caution at Burnley.","Manuel Pellegrini vented his frustration out at Mark Clattenburg after he failed to award a penalty to his side when they were 1-0 up against Arsenal .

"CBS has cut a Rihanna song from its Thursday night football broadcasts amid more controversy over the NFL and domestic violence. The network said Tuesday it was permanently editing a song featuring Rihanna's voice out of its Thursday night NFL telecasts — after the singer issued a profane tweet about it. However the singer has hit back, claiming she actually rescinded the rights to the song before CBS dropped it. A portion of Jay-Z's Run This Town featuring Rihanna - who was the victim of a high-profile domestic assault in 2009 -  was cut from last Thursday's game because CBS was covering the controversy over Rice's assault of his then-fiancee. Scroll down for video . Not happy: Rihanna took to Twitter on Tuesday to vent her frustration at CBS after they pulled her NFL performance in the wake of the Ray Rice scandal . Angry: Rihanna reacts on Twitter after it was suggested her being the victim of a high-profile domestic violence incident was the reason her NFL performance was pulled . CBS . planned to use the song Thursday and for the rest of the season, but . Rihanna tweeted, 'CBS you pulled my song last week, now you wanna slide . it back in this Thursday?' Before adding: 'NO! F**** you! Y'all are sad for penalizing me for this. CBS then issued a statement saying that it was 'moving in a different direction' with different theme music. CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus had said that the changes were made to give the game coverage a more 'subdued' tone and journalistic approach. Asked if Rihanna's own history as a victim of domestic violence was a reason the song was cut, McManus said it was among several factors considered but was not the overriding one. Rihanna - whose then boyfriend Chris Brown was charged with assault for attacking the singer at the 2009 Grammys - added on Twitter: 'The audacity'. But the singer claims she was angered that CBS marketed their Thursday Night Football show using Rihanna's name, even though they had only licensed her song for the opening credits. A spokesman told TMZ: 'Due to the misuse and misrepresentation of Rihanna's name and participation in connection to CBS TNF, CBS was not allowed to license and utilize the song 'Run This Town.' Roc Nation made the decision to not grant the song’s usage.' Nope, not finished: Rihanna went back on Twitter to add a second thought . Why should she be penalized?

"A new book claims that Vice-President Joe Biden upsets female Secret Service agents by swimming naked wherever he goes. The book The First Family Detail by best-selling author Robert Kessler purports to tell the behind the scenes secrets of the two most powerful offices in the world as seen by their protection details. Vice-President Biden, claims the book, is more interested in being seen as a 'regular Joe' than the second most powerful man in the world. Vice President Joe Biden is more interested in being seen a a regular guy than the man who is a hearbeat away from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue . 'Agents say that, whether at the vice president's residence or at his home in Delaware, Biden has a habit of swimming in his pool nude,' Mr Kessler writes. 'Female Secret Service agents find that offensive.' The naked swimming and the last-minute changes of schedule mean that being assigned to Mr Biden is seen as 'the second worst assignment in the Secret Service,' Mr Kessler writes. The worst says the book is working for former First Lady and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mr Kessler, the author of 19 books, has been accused by Democrats of writing anti-Clinton and anti-Kennedy stories by using anonymous sources who by their very nature are hard to verify. A spokesman for Secretary Clinton (above) told the New York Daily News that Mr Kessler joins two other authors who have written Clinton takedowns in 'a hat trick of despicable actors concocting trashy nonsense' The two most powerful men in the world: President Barack Obama stands with Vice President Joe Biden . Vice-President Biden is concerned that his motorcade (above) does not disturb his neighbours in Delaware . Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Secretary Clinton, told the Washington Examiner reported the New York Daily News that Mr Kessler joins two other authors (Daniel Halper and Ed Klein) who have written Clinton takedowns this summer in 'a hat trick of despicable actors concocting trashy nonsense. Joe Biden's appointment as Barack Obama's number two was the culmination of a career that saw him, in 1988, attempt to become the youngest president since John F. Kennedy (who also had a propensity for nude swimming). In September 1987, the campaign ran into trouble when he was accused of plagiarising a speech that had been made earlier that year by Neil Kinnock. Mr Biden stood down. 'Their behaviour should neither be allowed nor enabled, and legitimate media outlets who know with every fibre of their beings that it is completely made up should not get down in the gutter with them.' The Secret Service is also concerned by Mr Biden's insistence that the motorcade that accompanies him everywhere does not disturb his neighbours in his home state of Delaware, says Mr Kessler. This means that the Vice-President put a potentially dangerous distance between himself and his motorcade that carries his on-call doctor and the the 40-pound 'football' that enables him, if necessary, to authorise the launching of a nuclear warhead. 'What's going to happen is either you're going to have a dead vice president in Delaware or you're going to have agents killed in Delaware because Secret Service management refused to stand up to [Vice-President Biden],' Mr Kessler quotes an unnamed agent as saying. President Barack Obama, and Vice-President Joe Biden - according to the Secret Service the VP is more concerned with being seen as an ordinary guy rather than the man who might have to launch a nuclear war .

"Mesut Ozil, condemned as a lightweight liability on the left this season, was restored to his central position against Aston Villa and responded with his best performance for some considerable time. His creativity was most potent in a concentrated burst of little over three minutes – the period when Arsenal scored the goals to win this game – but throughout the match he showed his class in linking play in various areas of the pitch. Arsenal completed 741 passes against Villa, the most by any Premier League side over the last two seasons, and Ozil was the offensive conductor – completing 54 forward half passes, the most of any Arsenal player, at a success rate of 91.5 per cent. Mesut Ozil celebrates his goal to give Arsenal the lead in their 3-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday . Mesut Ozil put in an outstanding performance against Aston Villa to silence his recent critics . Ozil was congratulated by team-mates Aaron Ramsey, Kieran Gibbs and Danny Welbeck after scoring . Courtesy of Opta . The touches were neat and the passes mainly simple but usually forward, continuing the flow of moves with minimal fuss. He looked sharp and, as Arsene Wenger made clear, this was a moment to have faith in his biggest signing. Drop him, was the call of most who have observed Ozil this season. Hand him a starring role, was his manager’s response. ‘I felt he was at the point where you have to show him that confidence is there and he showed as well he can respond when he is under scrutiny,’ explained Wenger. It was a courageous managerial decision which paid off. As Ozil’s heat map shows he was not prohibited to solely central areas, rather he moved across the line just behind striker Danny Welbeck depending on the ebb and flow of the game. He would also drop deeper to receive the ball and start attacks, following the trail of the ball as it moved up the pitch. Particularly pleasing for Wenger was the way Ozil linked up with Welbeck. The former Manchester United striker fed the German for his goal and the pair also exchanged passes to make it 2-0. Early days for the partnership, but promising signs. ‘That instinctiveness will come,’ said Welbeck. The German maestro was revitalised playing in a central position, as opposed to the left . Ozil showed the energy and creativity that has been missing from his game so often this season . Welbeck showed his appreciation to his new team-mate after Ozil put it on a plate for the Arsenal forward . VIDEO Ozil is not a scapegoat - Wenger . Minutes played: 90 . Goals: 1 . Attempts on target: 1 . Attempts off target: 1 . Total passes: 75 . Accurate passes: 69 . Pass completion: 92 per cent . Accurate forward half passes: 54 . Forward half pass completion: 91.5% . Assists: 1 . Key passes: 2 . Courtesy of Opta . Wenger admitted the No 10 role is the position Ozil craves. But it meant Alexis Sanchez and Jack Wilshere moved to the bench and Aaron Ramsey operated alongside Mikel Arteta in the holding role. ‘I find you ten more players in my squad who want to play in the middle,’ Wenger added with a smile. That is the conundrum now for the Frenchman, who must work out a formula that sees all his stars shine. If he continues to thrust Ozil onto the platform which holds no hiding place it leaves Ramsey needing to operate deeper or out wide – where the Welshman only fitfully performed in the season before his breakthrough last campaign. Wilshere wants the job of supplying the striker too, he did well higher up against Manchester City, but it may be he is best dictating from further back and bombing forward. Ozil finished the day at Wembley with Lukas Podolski watching boxer George Groves defeat Christopher Rebrasse in an EBU and WBC Silver and Final Eliminator Super Middleweight title fight . Ozil showed his true class after a disappointing midweek display against Dortmund . Sanchez will not stay on the bench on many more occasions so Wenger needs to find a way to incorporate the Chilean to greatest effect. This is all before we consider Santi Cazorla, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott, once he returns from injury, a player who made his desires to play centrally evident during his contract stand-off. It is a problem most manager’s in the Premier League would give their right leg and probably a few fingers to have, but could still leave Wenger chewing the fingernails.

"When they first played one another seven years ago Rory McIlroy was left fuming at Billy Horschel’s behaviour. On Sunday afternoon they will fight it out for the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup….and the tidy sum of $11.44 million. The pair are tied at the top after McIlroy shot 67 – his 25th score under par out of his last 27 rounds - and Horschel a 69. For the former, there’s the chance to add yet more lustre to a season that has already seen him claim two majors plus two other prestigious events. For the latter, he has the opportunity to win for the second week in a row. If either wins the event with its $1.44 million first prize, they will also take home the $10 million FedEx bonus. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rory McIlroy training with drag weights during the FedEx Cup . Rory McIlroy hits his tee shot on the first hole during the third round of the Tour Championship . -9 Rory McIlroY . Billy Horschel . -7 Jim Furyk . -6 Jason Day . Rickie Fowler . Justin Rose . -5 Ryan Palmer . Russell Henley . Chris Kirk . As the curtain comes down on the PGA Tour season on Sunday, it might not be just about this pair. Justin Rose, Rickie Fowler, Jason Day or the ever-consistent Jim Furyk might have might have something to say about that. Furyk starts two off the pace, with the other trio a further shot adrift. But if either McIlroy or Horschel remain in the top two one of them will win the FedEx bonus, regardless of the efforts of the others, because of their higher ranking going into the event, following the first three FedEx play-off tournaments. Back in 2007 it was all about pride at the Walker Cup, where McIlroy felt Horschel went too far in playing the role of the ugly American. ‘Loud and obnoxious’ was his verdict. Rory McIlroy watches his tee shot on the tenth hole during the third round of the Tour Championship . Happily the pair have now settled their differences. ‘We were very young at the Walker Cup,’ said 27 year old Horschel. ‘At 20 you’re going to do things you’re going to regret.’ They’ve not done too much to regret in the interim, of course. The pair began this event as the two hottest players in the world – and have gone out and shown it. Out in the last group as well on Saturday, they fought a tense battle, with Horschel’s brilliant putting stroke keeping him in the race. He has now gone more than 150 holes since his last three putt – and hasn’t missed one inside 6ft for two events. As for McIlroy, he shrugged aside a slow start to the back nine with a wonderful eagle three at the 15th, where he rolled in a 30ft putt. McIlroy versus Horschel would be a brilliant dress rehearsal for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles but for the fact the latter isn’t part of the American team. Neither is Chris Kirk, the other young American who currently leads the FedEx race but who has left himself a mountain to climb today after slipping four off the pace. Rory McIlroy (left) and Billy Horschel are tied for the lead going into the final round in Atlanta . Rory McIlroy shakes hands with Billy Horschel following their third round of the Tour Championship . American Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson underlined his exasperation with a text to Horschel on Friday:’Why didn’t you play like this earlier?’ But leaving Kirk behind is all his own fault. He took on McIlroy over the final 36 holes in Boston a fortnight ago and beat him – just 24 hours before the wild cards were announced. The timing looked perfect – except Watson went for Webb Simpson. As he has been doing all week, Simpson continued to trawl the bottom of the field, coming in with a 72 to be placed 27th in the 29 man field. Playing alongside him, fellow wild card pick Hunter Mahan beat him by one to be tied 25th. As one frustrated American wittily put it: ’They worked on their worse ball strategy for Gleneagles.’ Rose has fought back wonderfully following a first round 72 with back-to-back rounds of 66. Even if he won the event it would be unlikely he would win the $10 million as well, but with $3 million going to the man who finishes second in the FedEx and anyone in the top five claiming a seven-figure sum, he has set himself up for a massive payday on Sunday.

"State Farm Insurance has pulled a television ad they created using actor Rob Schneider from the air following a social media outcry over the comedian's controversial opposition to child vaccinations. The Deuce Bigalow star, 50, caused a stir several years ago when he said that childhood vaccines are the likely cause of autism. The Saturday Night Live veteran has continued to stand by his views, which have been discredited by the medical community, according to Mediaite. While Schneider's TV appearance for State Farm Insurance had nothing to do with vaccinations, viewers united in a chorus of condemnation, calling for him to be ousted. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Comedic actor Rob Schneider, 50, appears in a new TV commercial for State Farm Insurance (pictured), which has now been pulled from the air because of his opposition to child vaccinations, which he believes can cause autism . Backlash: The TV ads sparked an outcry on social media, with a subsequent video (pictured) saying Schneider is not an eligible spokesperson for a major insurance company . They claimed that someone who publicly dispels 'dangerous opinions' should not be a spokesman for a major insurance company. The campaign quickly spread on social media, pushed by a video that asked supporters to post comments on State Farm's Facebook and Twitter pages. 'State Farm provides health insurance, and nothing ensures public health more than getting vaccinated,' the video said. 'It is time to end the anti-vaccination movement; with your help, we can elicit change.' As a result, State Farm removed the commercial. '(Schneider's) ad has unintentionally been used as a platform for discussion unrelated to the products and services we provide,' Phil Supple, the insurance company's director of public affairs, told PR Week. 'With that, we are working to remove the ad from our rotation at this time.' In 2012, Schneider - a father-of-one and member of the Rerpublican Party - publicly opposed California Bill AB 2109. Outspoken: Schneider was opposed to California Bill AB 2109 in 2012, which inevitable passed . The bill required parents to better understand the risks and reswards of child vaccinations. When the bill passed, Schneider hit out the decision on Twitter, Yahoo TV reported. 'Today California passed a law to force parents to get a Doc's permission to not vaccinate their kids or they can't attend school! Nazi's,' he wrote. Schneider is yet to comment on State Farm's decision regarding the ad. The commercials first hit TV at the end of August, and didn't take long to spark controversy. In them Schneider portrays his famous and long-running SNL character, Richmeister. The ads were developed by DDB Chicago.","TV ads promoting State Farm Insurance first appeared in late August .

"After what will have seemed like an eternity to Liverpool fans, Brendan Rodgers leads his men into the Champions League for the first time in five seasons on Tuesday. No more painful evenings of sitting at home watching the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City mixing it with the best in Europe, while Liverpool toiled against the continent's second tier, or worse still had no European football at all at Anfield. But back in 2009/10, instead of leading Liverpool to their third Champions League final in six seasons, Rafa Benitez - the man in charge at the time - oversaw a disastrous third-place finish in their group with Fiorentina, Lyon and Hungarians Debrecen. And to illustrate just how much has changed at the club since the 2009/10 season, we've picked out five key points from autumn 2009 at Anfield. In just five years Raheem Sterling has gone from obscurity to worldwide fame with Liverpool and England . Star forward Raheem Sterling was just a 14-year-old trainee with QPR . Sterling might be a household name to many now with his trademark direct running and rapidly-improving link-up play, but back then the QPR prospect was so young he would have been denied entry to a 15-certificate film at his local cinema. He went on to join the Reds in an initial deal of £400,000 in early 2010 after being wowed by former Liverpool hero Fernando Torres on a visit to Melwood to check out the set-up. Back in 2009 Brendan Rodgers only surived a few months at struggling Championship Reading . Brendan Rodgers was about to get shown the door at Championship Reading . The Northern Irishman was considered a talented up-and-coming manager after a spell working with Jose Mourinho at Chelsea and helping Watford to avoid relegation in his first managerial job. But things didn't go quite so well at Reading, when the then 36-year-old rookie boss only made it to December before a poor run of results saw him leave by mutual consent. After a short spell out, the resilient Rodgers took Swansea up in his first season and comfortably kept them there before Liverpool came calling. American duo George Gillette (left) and Tom Hicks oversaw a tumultuous running of the club at that time . George Gillette and Tom Hicks were still in control of the club . The tumultuous reign of the Americans was still in full effect in the autumn of 2009 (they weren't ousted until late 2010) as Benitez found himself constantly clashing with Gillette and Hicks over the running of team affairs. Just how destabilising their control of the club had been didn't become clear to many until they'd been shown the door in dramatic fashion. Alberto Aquilani was bought in to replace Xabi Alonso in the Liverpool midfield for the 2009/10 season . Alberto Aquilani is the man entrusted to replace the hugely popular Xabi Alonso . Selling Alonso to Real Madrid in the summer of 2009 is a mistake Benitez must still rue to this day. But buying Alberto Aquilani for £20million, who was injured for the first few weeks of his Liverpool career, was arguably a bigger mistake. Aquilani only managed a handful of games for the Reds, before a number of loans in his native Italy finally brought about a permanent sale to Fiorentina at a huge loss. Even more damaging was the Alonso-shaped hope in the Liverpool midfield for some time after. Steven Gerrard, seen here in Liverpool's disastrous campaign, is one of only three surviving senior players . Emiliano Ensua (left) and Diego Cavalieri lined up for Liverpool in their last Champions League match . Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson, Martin Skrtel and Lucas Leiva are the only remaining senior players from that period . The best way to illustrate the churn of players through the door at Anfield since that time is that the only current senior players from the 2009/10 are Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson, Martin Skrtel and Lucas Leiva. The starting line-up in Liverpool's final match of that campaign (which they lost 2-1 to Fiorentina) included such stellar talents as Diego Cavalieri in goal, Stephen Darby and Emiliano Ensua in defence, while Andrea Dossena put his attacking skills to great effect on the left wing. Champions League winner in 2005 with Liverpool, Luis Garcia, reveals his happiness about their return . Liverpool fans will be hoping their return to the Champions League has a very different outcome to the last time they graced Europe's elite competition.","Liverpool return to the Champions League for the first time since the 2009/10 season on Tuesday .

"Thousands of people who fled Syria's 'capital of the revolution' two years ago returned today to see the apocalyptic destruction wreaked on their city. Snapping photographs on their phones, the displaced first began wandering nervously down paths carved from rubble yesterday in the old quarters of Homs, where thousands died in the ultimately failed battle by rebels against the troops of President Bashar al-Assad. The scene that greeted them was devastating. Whole city blocks had been pounded into an endless scene of hollowed-out buildings, covered in dust. The streets were littered with shattered concrete bricks, toppled telephone poles and charred, crumpled skeletons of cars. Apocalyptic: Many of the people who began streaming into the old quarters of Homs yesterday had not seen their homes for two years. They were greeted by a post-apocalyptic landscape of burnt-out buildings and charred cars, and had to traverse paths through the rubble which government forces had cleared hours earlier . Then and now: This image taken before the conflict shows how the same street in Homs used to look, until it was ravaged by three years of civil war . Devastation: Smoke rises from al-Hamdeya neighbourhood in Homs yesterday. The area saw some of the fiercest fighting between rebels and forces of President Assad . Returning home: Some were lucky to find possessions still intact after two years, but many were not. Whole tower blocks were reduced to dust and twisted metal . Steady stream: Former residents filmed the blacked-out buildings on their camera phones as they returned to claim their possessions and begin rebuilding the city . Return to normal: Some squares looked remarkably untouched and thousands of people continued today to flood back into abandoned neighbourhoods . More than 150,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Assad's regime began in March 2011, and Homs was the centre of much of the fighting, known by many as the 'capital of the revolution'. Once a thriving city of more than a million people, President Bashar Assad's troops blockaded the neighborhoods of Homs for more than a year, pounding rebel bastions with his artillery and air force. Finally, under a deal struck this week, the rebels surrendered in a major victory for the government. The regime assumed control of the old quarters, while in return some 2,000 rebel fighters were granted safe passage to opposition areas north of Homs. The final piece of the agreement fell into place yesterday afternoon as the last 300 or so rebels left Homs, and an aid convoy was allowed into two pro-government villages in northern Syria which had been besieged by the opposition. The seizure of Homs is not only symbolic - the city is also a tactical and logistical linchpin which the government can use to launch further offensives on rebel-held territory in the north. Lawless: The Syrian Civil War began as an uprising more than three years ago, as rebels took to the streets to protest against five decades of rule by the Ba'ath party . Tension: Although the peace deal was a major victory for the Syrian government, troops were still patrolling the streets and escorting residents in and out of the area . A path through the wreckage: Once a thriving city of more than a million people, Homs will now be a linchpin from which Assad's forces can launch further offensives . Bleak: Long since abandoned, shops lay in ruins with their metal shutters twisted out of shape from the fighting. Many buildings still stand, but others were flattened . Battered: The remains of buildings in  one of the worst-hit neighbourhoods. People returning were required to hand over their IDs to government troops . Even before the last rebels departed, government bulldozers were clearing paths through the heaviest rubble in Homs' battle-scarred districts yesterday. It marked the first time that government troops have entered these neighborhoods, the last rebel bastions in the city, in more than a year. Homs governor Talal Barazi said engineering units were combing Hamidiyeh and other parts of the old quarters in search of mines. State TV said two soldiers were killed while dismantling a bomb. Troops reportedly discovered two field hospitals in the neighborhoods of Bab Houd and Qarabis, and network of underground tunnels linking the districts to each other and to the countryside. In Hamadiyeh, a predominantly Christian neighborhood before the fighting caused residents to flee, people trickled back in to check on their properties. Imad Nanaa, 52, returned to examine his home for the first time in almost three years - and found it almost intact, compared to other houses with shattered windows and crumbling walls. Speaking nervously and hurriedly because he wanted to leave as quickly as possible, he said he was looking forward to coming back with his family as soon as the army allowed it. 'This deal has saved us from more blood and destruction,' he said. Life resumes: Thousands of people are returning to burnt-out neighbourhoods to fetch their possessions before the army allows them to return permanently . Growing up: As people's confidence grew throughout yesterday and today, residents brought their children back to their homes, including some in pushchairs . Poignant: One man left the home he abandoned years earlier carrying a guitar, its case still caked in dust from the fighting. Another woman had a stack of photo albums . Truce: Forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad play football at al-Hamdeya neighborhood in Homs as the area's remaining 270 rebels were granted safe exit . Trinkets: People removed sentimental heirlooms from their homes. Homs Governor Talal Barazi announced that the old city has become 'safe and empty of weapons and gunmen thanks to the heroes of the Syrian Arab Army'. The rebels have been exhausted by two years of fighting and will now face a renewed assault in the north . Rubble-strewn: A man carries a religious figure yesterday through the primarily Christian neighbourhood, which has been one of the worst-hit in the two-year siege . Hundreds of men, women and children - some in pushchairs - walked through parts of the eight-mile-long old quarters, flashing victory signs and taking pictures. Some men in the first group dashed inside, passing burned-out cars and heavily damaged buildings. People returning were required to hand over their IDs to the troops upon entering the formerly rebel-held districts. The soldiers then returned the papers as the people filed out later. One man walked out with a guitar under his arm. A woman emerged from her home carrying a stack of photo albums. 'I have nothing left for me to remember so I brought these photos,' the woman, Fadia al-Ahmar, said. 'My house was destroyed.' The staggering scale of destruction in the area spoke to the ferocity of the fighting. In the Maljaa neighborhood, every building was damaged, even cars parked inside. An eight-storey building was flattened into rubble. Shop fronts were pancaked and walls of apartment blocks were blasted with holes from artillery and tank shells. A bitter victory: Pro-government forces were cheerful, but the fighting has claimed 150,000 lives, and for some in the country anti-Assad sentiment is still strong . Troops: All the churches in one neighbourhood were damaged by the fighting, but it is not known whether they were deliberate targets of Islamist extremists among the rebels, or simply random casualties of the fighting like hundreds of other buildings. Greek Orthodox bishop George Abu Zakhm said the situation in Homs is 'catastrophic' Contemplative: A resident talks on his phone as he looks up at the remains of a building. One woman said: 'I have nothing left for me to remember so I brought photos' Celebration: A boy takes photos of a man and his children at Old Clock square in Homs (left) and former residents Ayman and Zinat return to their neighbourhood (right) Untouched: This photo of the city's Old Clock square nearby, taken in December 2011 when the conflict was in its infancy, highlights the devastation wrought . Rubble: Damage to the Um al-Zinar church, one of 11 in the old quarter of Homs. The city's Greek Orthodox bishop said all 11 of the churches have been badly damaged . Protest remains: A staged photo by the anti-government activist group Aleppo Media Center (AMC) shows citizens forming the word Homs in Arabic with their bodies . Back in Hamadiyeh, the historic St Mary Church of the Holy Belt was heavily damaged, although the thick stone walls were still standing. There were no pews and some of the icons were disfigured, while the Syriac Orthodox church's damaged bell lay on the ground in the courtyard. The Greek Orthodox bishop in Homs, George Abu Zakhm, said the situation there is 'catastrophic'. He added all 11 churches in Homs' old quarter have been either heavily damaged or destroyed. He accused the rebels of lighting a fire inside the 6th century Greek Orthodox St. Elian Church, and said icons dating back hundreds of years 'are still on the walls but they were blackened.' Islamic extremists among Syria's rebels have desecrated churches elsewhere in Syria, but there was no immediate evidence to suggest that opposition fighters were responsible for the damage to Christian sites in central Homs. The truth is that almost every building, not just churches, bore heavy and tragic scars from the fighting.","Old quarters of Homs, once a thriving city of a million people, were at centre of battle between rebels and government .

"Strikers can be the difference between Champions League qualification or twiddling your thumbs for the next season and, as the transfer window closes, clubs now know what they have at their disposal. Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and the two Manchester giants have chosen their deadliest finishers, but how do each of the big five shape up just three games into the new campaign? Here, Sportsmail examine and rate the three key strikers of the top five Premier League clubs. Manchester City (rated 24.5 out of 30) Born: Argentina, June 2 1988 (age 26) Premier League record: 90 apps (54 gls) Sergio Aguero (9/10) A name synonymous with that unforgettable piece of commentary as Aguero's 95th-minute winner against QPR saw City crowned Premier League champions of 2011-12. Deadly, composed, and there when he's relied upon. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Radamel Falcao's incredible career so far . Nine out of 10: Striker Sergio Aguero has proved himself deadly for Manchester City in the Premier League . Born: Yugoslavia, March 17 1986 (age 28) Premier League record: 108 apps (46 gls) Edin Dzeko (8/10) The towering Bosnia striker's impressive goal record somewhat creeps up on you. The under-rated centre forward, while not always first choice, can be world-class on his day at the age of 28. He's gr-eight: Edin Dzeko is an under-rated striker with a record to prove worthy of the Premier League giants . Born: Yugoslavia, Nov 2 1989 (age 24) Premier League record: 13 apps (5 gls) Stevan Jovetic (7.5/10) Jovetic gave a glimpse of what he can do with a brace against Liverpool. Must put his injury-plagued debut season last year behind him and compete to be in the starting XI. Not a bad problem for Manuel Pellegrini to have. Coming to the fore: Stevan Jovetic's Premier League career is just 13 games old, but he looks the part . Born: Brazil, October 7 1988 (age 25) Premier League record: 3 apps (4 gls) Chelsea (24 out of 30) Diego Costa (9/10) Costa got life in the Premier League off to a better start than Aguero, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Fernando Torres and more. Already looks the answer to Jose Mourinho's prayers, and never a dull moment with the La Liga winner on the pitch. Super start: There is never a dull moment when Diego Costa plays and Chelsea look glad to have the striker . Born: France, January 2 1987 (age 27) Premier League record: 41 apps (20 gls) Loic Remy (7.5/10) A proven goalscorer in the Premier League with QPR and Newcastle, and nominated to fill Fernando Torres's barely-worn shoes. Could be considered a steal at £8million, should Mourinho make use of his new forward. Bargain buy: Loic Remy, former QPR and Newcastle striker, could prove a steal at £8million . Born: Ivory Coast, March 11 1978 (age 36) Chelsea record: 229 apps (100 gls) Didier Drogba (7.5/10) A Chelsea hero for his exploits against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final of 2012. Those at Stamford Bridge need not fret if the strong striker is occasionally relied upon, even at the age of 36. Ideal foil: Didier Drogba, at the age of 36, can provide cover for Costa and Co in the Chelsea strike force . Born: England, October 24 1985 (age 28) Premier League record: 375 apps (174 gls) Manchester United (26 out of 30) Wayne Rooney (8.5/10) The England and United captain looks very much part of Louis van Gaal's plans for the reconstruction period at Old Trafford. Ten years since signing, on £300,000-a-week and at the age of 28, Rooney must repay the faith. Leading role: Wayne Rooney signed 10 years ago and must prove worthy of his captaincy . Born: Holland, Aug 6 1983 (age 31) Premier League record: 272 apps (144 gls) Robin van Persie (8.5/10) It was United's new utility player Daley Blind who assisted that iconic diving header from Van Persie at the World Cup in Brazil. Can prove clinical for Van Gaal - if fitness persists - and is knowingly feared by opposition defenders. Dutch destroyer: Robin van Persie can be as deadly as ever for Louis van Gaal, if fitness keeps up . Born: Colombia, February 10 1986 (age 28) La Liga record: 68 apps (52 gls) Radamel Falcao (9/10) Not the signing United, nor the footballing world, expected. Yet Van Gaal couldn't resist. The Premier League debutant is a classic modern-day striker - big, fast-paced, quick-footed and strong, big. With United's seemingly weak defence, a frighteningly-good front line may be necessary. Loan star: Radamel Falcao is new to the Premier League but has every chance of fulfilling his potential . Born: England, September 1 1989 (age 25) Premier League record: 142 apps (58 gls) Liverpool (24.5 out of 30) Daniel Sturridge (9/10) Shouldered the responsibility at Anfield following Luis Suarez's departure, and doesn't look deterred. The England striker, packed with talent, knows how to influence a game. Forever a threat with Sturridge on the pitch. Main man: Daniel Sturridge is forever a threat in front of goal and is now Liverpool's go-to guy up the top . Born: Italy, August 12 1990 (age 24) Premier League record: 55 apps (20 gls) Mario Balotelli (8.5/10) A bad boy, a liability, an unpredictable character, what else? Call him what you will, but Balotelli will excel if Brendan Rodgers can curb the striker's behaviour that earned him his infamous reputation. Easy to forget he's still 24. Unpredictable: Mario Balotelli, known as a bad boy, can excel under new manager Brendan Rodgers . Born: England, February 16 1982 (age 32) Premier League record: 77 apps (28 gls) Rickie Lambert (7/10) Yet to get off the mark for his boyhood club - both in pre-season and the Premier League - but more often than not in the right place at the right time for Southampton. The goal should come, if the minutes follow under Rodgers. Looking to kick on: Rickie Lambert should get off the mark for Liverpool soon  if he gets sufficient game time . Born: France, September 30 1986 (age 27) Premier League record: 72 apps (28 gls) Arsenal (20.5 out of 30) Olivier Giroud (7.5/10) Injury aside, Giroud knows how to outwit a defence. The striker, out for four months after having surgery on a broken leg, will  be key to Arsene Wenger's  push for a coveted top-four spot. Pressure to hit the ground running. Focal point: Olivier Giroud knows how to outwit a defence but his injury will keep him frustrated . Born: France, January 27 1993 (age 21) Premier League record: 10 apps (0 gls) Yaya Sanogo (5/10) Wenger hoped Sanogo would be a worthy replacement for Giroud. Sadly, he looks anything but. The former France Under 21 striker doesn't look Premier League material as of yet. Still just 21, though, but has competition up front now. Weak link: Yaya Sanogo is yet to look Premier League material at Arsenal with no goals in 10 matches . Born: England, November 23 1990 (age 23) Premier League record: 116 apps (26 gls) Danny Welbeck (8/10) A Marmite character. You either love him or hate him, but Wenger files himself in the former category after splashing £16m on the forward. Given a run in the Arsenal first team, though, and we may see a more noticeable Welbeck. Marmite: Danny Welbeck's £16m move to Arsenal from Manchester United gives him a real chance .","Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and the two Manchester giants have three strikers apiece to challenge for coveted Premier League top-four spot .

"Carson Tinker knows a thing or two about triumph. He wrote a book about getting over adversity, too. Before joining the NFL’s Jacksonville Jaguars, Tinker was in the midst of a hugely successful college career with Alabama before his life was one of many to change on April 27, 2011. As tornadoes devastated the Yellowhammer State, fifty two people perished in Tuscaloosa. One of them was Tinker’s girlfriend, Ashley Harrison. ‘Tornadoes come like spur of the moment; you don’t really have a lot of time to prepare,’ the 24-year-old long snapper recalled. Carson Tinker does not wish to be defined by the 2011 tragedy and has forged a career in the NFL . Tinker practises snapping at EverBank Field, Jacksonville ahead of an NFL game last year . ‘We were watching the weather. They said it was coming and my room-mate and I went outside and we looked for it, but it was behind us so we couldn’t see it. My grandfather called and said we need to take shelter, so we took shelter in the property. About 30 seconds later it hit the house.’ In a closet alongside two of his room-mates, Tinker cuddled and reassured Ashley that everything would be OK. But winds of 190mph shredded the house, ripping it from its foundations. The twister threw him 50 feet, and while both his friends survived, when he woke in hospital the next morning, he discovered the devastating news. ‘You’re not defined by what you go through. You’re defined by how you respond. And that’s how I want to be defined. ‘And the circumstance of the tornado, suffering loss and being injured, my vision was to play football and three years later, I’m playing football in the NFL. And I think it’s really cool how far I’ve come. ‘Football has given me a really unique platform to be able to encourage people and inspire, challenge and motivate and not only in America, but now in London,’ he said before the Jaguars’ game against the Dallas Cowboys at Wembley on Sunday. Tinker poses with a photo of Robbie Savage during a television interview, where he was asked if he knew who the former Wales international was. He did not! Tinker (left) prepares to snap on a second quarter punt against the Buffalo Bills last season . Tinker suffered a broken wrist, severe concussion and an injury to his ankle which required a radical new technique from Dr Michael Beckenstein. ‘I got a skin graft from a cadaver. That’s not my real skin on there,’ Tinker says, pointing to a not unsubstantial scar near his right ankle, ‘that’s somebody else’s skin. It’s a pretty new procedure. ‘He did the skin draft in the locker room after one of our college games. It was able to heal in the middle of the football season, under the most hostile conditions. They tried it on a few hundred people and mine was one of the only ones that worked.’ Swept away by the love and support of his college and the community, the inspirational Tinker helped to rebuild a town which had seen nearly 2,500 homes damaged by a deadly mile-wide trail of destruction. He became a household name in America and was named as a finalist for Sports Illustrated’s Sportsperson of the Year award in 2011. At Alabama, TInker (right) won three BCS national championships and two SEC championships . After 18 months of reflection, he released a book in May (A Season to Remember: Faith in the Midst of the Storm), about the aftermath of the tornado and the Crimson Tide’s championship-winning season. All proceeds go to his charity, the Be A Blessing foundation, which helps those who have suffered loss or hardship. ‘I thought it was an opportunity to help people and to inspire people and my mantra has been some people ask for blessings, but I ask that I can be a blessing, and that’s what I wanted to do with the book. ‘I definitely wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for my family and my friends, my team-mates and the rehab staff at Alabama College. That’s another reason why I wanted to give back to them because they lifted me up when I needed it most. I can’t thank them enough.’ A deeply religious man, Tinker draws strength from his faith and also from his parents, who have both survived cancer. ‘My mum when I was in third grade and my dad when I was in eighth grade. Just growing up and having them as role models and being able to watch them face adversity and how they handled it. Actions speak louder than words.’ Which is clearly a mantra that  Tinker lives by.

"Jose Mourinho insists his relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo is 'non-existent' since he left Real Madrid and returned to Chelsea in 2013. Mourinho won the Spanish La Liga title once during his three years at the Bernabeu with compatriot Ronaldo as his star forward. But despite describing the Portuguese World Player of the Year as a 'goal machine' and wishing him the best in club and international football, Mourinho says: 'You would not find us hanging around together.' Jose Mourinho talks to Cristiano Ronaldo during their time together at Real, but says they no longer speak . Mourinho (centre) and Ronaldo (right) celebrate their La Liga title together with Madrid in 2012 . 'The relationship does not exist,' Mourinho told Portugal's TV1. 'He plays for Real Madrid and I'm at Chelsea. You would not find us hanging around together. 'I remember the good and the not so good. I remember that he is a goal machine, he helped me to become a champion, to win the cup and the Super Cup. 'He probably also helped him and each of us to make history in winning the league with 100 points against the best Barcelona side in history. 'Cristiano Ronaldo gives me great memories and I wish him all the best in his career, for his country and for his club, because when I go to a club I go with a sense of belonging and wish my former players continued success.' Mourinho said he was proud of his record at Real and would return to the Spanish giants if given a second chance, but refused to discuss the reasons behind his exit. 'On one hand I achieved a goal: to win three championships that I consider the most important in the world (England, Italy and Spain). That goal was important.' 'Yes, definitely (I would go back). It was an experience as a man and as a coach that I would repeat again without thinking twice.' The Portuguese manager revealed that he would love to return to rejoin Real Madrid if possible .

'I am a happy man, I am going to matches and training with great joy and I am not a person who likes to be talking about the past.' The Chelsea boss also admitted his return to Stamford Bridge at the beginning of last season was unplanned, and that he was surprised to have the chance to sign Cesc Fabregas in the summer.

'This is the only time that I'm not thinking about the next stage of my career,' said Mourinho. 'Before I always thought about what would come next. 'Without being planned, I'm back. I prefer it as a place to work and for my family and social life. I returned here because the club has a different project. In my first spell Financial Fair Play did not exist.' 'For me it was a surprise that he (Fabregas) came. We knew the type of player that we wanted but I never thought there was a chance Fabregas would come. 'I always thought he would stay in Barcelona, or if he returned to England it would be with Arsenal.

"On the pitch, there are few players in the world that excite as much as Barcelona forward Neymar Jnr but when it comes to showcasing his musical talents, he leaves plenty to be desired. The 22-year-old shared a video on his Instagram feed on Friday of him and three of his pals belting out a Brazilian love song in a car.

Neymar has already netted 13 times for Barcelona this season and has scored an impressive 15 goals for Brazil in 2014 in just 13 appearances. It is the sort of form that led to Brazilian legend Ronaldo this week claiming that his compatriot should be considered one of the world's best players. 'Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi are the best right now, but Neymar has come a long way.

"Prison: Mark Howe has been sentenced to life in prison after he stabbed his mother 53 times and left her to die . A care home worker obsessed with TV serial killer Dexter has been jailed after he admitted murdering his mother after the pair had rowed about his cannabis smoking. Mark Howe repeatedly stabbed and slashed Katrina Wardle in the face, mouth, neck, chest and arms before leaving her to bleed to death on her bedroom floor in an 'appallingly savage' attack. A judge said the brutal assault was 'akin to torture'. The 21-year-old, who the court heard 'lived in a fantasy world', attacked Mrs Wardle, 48, at the family home in St Matthew’s, Leicester, in the early hours of July 16 last year. Leicester Crown Court was told Howe was 'a recluse' obsessed with US TV series Dexter, which features a fictional police worker, Dexter Morgan, leading a double life as a serial knife-wielding killer. He used a photograph of Dexter Morgan with a blood-splattered face as his own Facebook profile picture - and had searched ‘Dexter’s kill knife’ on the internet in the run-up to the killing. Judge Mr Justice Haddon-Cave sentenced Howe to life in prison, and told him he would have to serve at least 21 years and six months before he could be considered for release. He added: 'You attacked your mother with appalling savagery, causing more than 53 separate wounds. One can only imagine the horror of her realisation at what was being done to her by her own son. 'The sheer brutality and ferocity of the attack, which must have lasted some minutes, was akin to torturing her. 'She curled up in a foetal position, trying to protect herself.' The court heard Howe carried out the 'horrifying act' with a 12-inch knife, the tip of which was bent by the force used. Katrina Wardle was murdered by her son Mark Howe in an 'appallingly savage' attack, a court has heard . Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: 'She didn’t die immediately. The totality of the wounds caused her to bleed to death. 'A passer-by heard her pleading with you to stop, but you didn’t and left her to die. 'You told Facebook friends you hated your mother, and became hateful towards her. 'Her family and friends are still struggling to understand why you committed this terrible and unnatural act.' The judge said he had been told, in mitigation, that Howe 'spent more and more time dwelling in a fantasy world' that seemed more real than his own. Howe lived with his step-father, Kris Wardle, 51, an HGV driver, and his mother, known as Tina, who worked as a cleaner. Howe used a photograph of Dexter Morgan with a blood-splattered face as his own Facebook profile picture - and had searched 'Dexter's kill knife' on the internet in the run-up to the killing . Nirmal Shant QC, prosecuting, said the couple noticed he became increasingly withdrawn, spending most of his time in his bedroom and rarely speaking. Miss Shant said: 'He had a history of self-harming and using knives, which they took from his room. 'He’d used knives to cut holes in his bedroom walls and made stab marks in the door and his punch bag was stabbed repeatedly.' 'You attacked your mother with appalling . savagery, causing more than 53 separate wounds. One can only imagine the . horror of her realisation at what was being done to her by her own son' - Judge Mr Justice Haddon-Cave . Miss Shant said Howe was 'obsessed with Dexter' - a blood spatter pattern analyst for the Miami Police Department who hunts down and kills criminals he believes deserve retribution. He told a friend in one message that he wished he was Dexter. Miss Shant said Howe had downloaded reports on murder weapons, after searching for 'Dexter’s kill knife' and also searched for 'What does a sociopath need to do to blend seamlessly with society?' The court heard that on the day before the murder, Mr Wardle set off for work, expecting to be away overnight. Howe went to work at a care home before returning home at 3.30pm and going to his room. Mrs Wardle left for her cleaning job at 7.20pm, returning home an hour later. At about 2.30am the next day - Tuesday, July 16 - a next door neighbour heard a woman either screaming or crying. Leicester Crown Court (pictured) was told Howe was 'a recluse' obsessed with US TV series Dexter, which features a fictional police worker, Dexter Morgan, leading a double life as a serial knife-wielding killer . A man passing by heard a female voice saying: 'Oh please, please don’t do it.' When interviewed by police after his arrest, Howe said he could not remember anything. Miss Shant said: 'He says he was in the bathroom covered in blood and when he looked through a gap in the door he could see his mother on the floor covered in blood.' Howe rang his older sister after the killing, asking if he could come to see her, saying he had been in a fight with a man and had badly cut his hand. 'His instructions remain that he can’t remember why or how he would have done such a thing, but he acknowledges he must have' - Rosina Cottage QC, mitigating . Having showered, he left the house taking a bag of clothes. He disposed of a blood-stained grey top near a park, then used his mother’s bank card to withdraw £100 from a cashpoint before going to a branch of McDonald’s, in Leicester city centre, to wash his hands. Howe then went to the Leicester care home where he worked and told staff he’d been attacked by his step-father. He left and went to another care home where he also had a job, on the way confessing to his sister, over the phone, that he had killed their mother after an argument about him smoking cannabis. He arrived at the second care home, initially claiming to have been in a fight. The police were called and he was arrested. Miss Shant said Howe’s sister, on hearing her mother had been stabbed, immediately contacted her step-father, who was in Barnsley. US TV series Dexter features a fictional police worker, Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter pattern analyst for the Miami Police Department, who leads a secret life hunting down and killing criminals he believes deserve retribution. Orphaned at the age of three, Dexter was and adopted by a Miami police officer who recognised he had homicidal tendencies. He was then taught to channel his passion for human dissection into killing only heinous criminals. The show has run for eight seasons and is set in Miami. He asked his father, Brian Wardle, to go to the house to see what had happened. Miss Shant said: 'When he got into the bedroom he could immediately see she was beyond help. She was dead.' Rosina Cottage QC, mitigating, said Howe had no previous convictions and had a schizoid personality disorder, although he was not suffering from diminished responsibility at the time of the offence. She said there was 'some pre-meditation' involved shortly before he got the knife from the kitchen and took it upstairs. 'His instructions remain that he can’t remember why or how he would have done such a thing, but he acknowledges he must have,' she said. 'He’s emotionally distant, but he does appear to be shocked by the magnitude of the offences and by what he’s done.' After the case, Mr Wardle said in a statement: 'Katrina was my Pole Star, immutable and persistent, always guiding, always shining brightly. 'She was the force that held me to the ground, the force that let me fly free above the world.' Detective Chief Inspector Siobhan Ashford, of Leicestershire Police, who led the investigation, said: 'This incident has destroyed a family and left many people devastated by the events. 'His actions have left ever-lasting consequences and he now faces a life behind bars.'","Mark Howe repeatedly stabbed and slashed his mother in brutal attack .

"Astrobiologist Abel Mendez of the . University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo has designed a software package . that can draw real-looking worlds based on the scientific data we receive from space telescopes  - and says Nasa gets it wrong. Mendez's software package draws planets based on their size, distance from their parent star and chemistry - and can create 3D images that correspond to the data. The imagery sent out when missions such as Nasa's Kepler telescope find 'exoplanets' - planets outside our solar system - is still imagined by artists. Mendez claims that his approach is more scientific. A warm, earthlike planet orbiting a red dwarf star. Mendez's software lets astronomers enter the data they know about a planet and then constructs a vision of what it might look like . A small, cold planet as recreated by Mendez's software. He says that Nasa's imaginings of planets may not always be accurate . Earth rendered 240 million years ago - when the continents were still gathered together into the 'supercontinent' named Pangaea . The Scientific Exoplanets Rendereris is designed to generate 'photo-real' images of other planets - and 'draws' its reconstructions using data such as chemicals detected by space telescopes and their size and surface temperature. Unlike 'artists reconstructions', it's all done mathematically. Mendez said of Nasa's reconstruction of Kepler 22-b, 'I think that the Nasa image got the color right but I don’t expect clouds like that. It probably will be more featureless like Uranus or Neptune and not so good for a press release.' Mendez's software is specially designed to reconstruct Earth-like exoplanets, either rocky or ocean in nature, but it is also able to generate visuals for gas giants and stars. It includes the reconstruction of realistic clouds and weather effects. A warm world larger than our Earth.

"CLICK HERE to watch Radamel Falcao's Top 10 goals... Radamel Falcao hopes that Manchester United sign him permanently at the end of his £6million loan, saying that he wants to ‘stay many years and make history’ at Old Trafford. The Colombia striker was unveiled alongside £14million midfielder Daley Blind on Thursday after taking part in his first training session with Louis van Gaal’s team. United have the option to buy Falcao from Monaco next summer in a deal worth a total of £52million after agreeing to pay the 28-year-old £280,000-a-week this season. Speaking in a combination of English and Spanish, Falcao said: ‘I hope to stay many years in Manchester United and make history at this club. When I was at FC Porto and Atletico Madrid I always wanted to improve and I dreamed about playing in a team like this. Now I want to stay here for many years.

It’s a big challenge for me for my career. I always dreamed to be in a club like Manchester United.’ Falcao has made six appearances and scored two goals for club and country since rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee playing for Monaco in a French Cup tie in January, but has yet to complete a full game. His brief appearance for Colombia as a substitute against Brazil in Miami on Friday took his total playing time to 217 minutes – an average of 38 minutes per game – but he insists that he is fully recovered. ‘Yes I feel well,’ he added. ‘I started to play two months ago with Monaco and I have improved in the last month a lot. I scored goals, and that is important to strikers. I’m confident with my physical form and I’m comfortable with my knee. I feel good in myself and happy to be here.’ Questions have been raised about how Louis van Gaal can fit Falcao, other new signing Angel Di Maria, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata into the same team, but the Colombian is confident that United can make it work as he prepares for a debut at home to QPR on Sunday. He said: ‘When you’re talking about settling in, when you’re talking about top-quality players it makes settling in more easy. ‘I think I will need not much time because Manchester United has very good players and it’s easier to play football.

I would rather focus on enjoying my football and making the most of the opportunity United have given me. I tend to set myself personal targets and goals, and that’s how players challenge themselves.’ Falcao was reluctant to talk about the other clubs linked with him this summer, including Real Madrid, Manchester City and Arsenal , but admitted that not playing in the Champions League for a fifth consecutive season is a blow. ‘It’s true, every player wants to play in the Champions League,’ he said. ‘This year it’s not possible in Manchester but we are confident that we will qualify next season. ‘I don’t want to talk about other teams.

"Only once he was away from the carnival of Rio de Janeiro did Manuel Neuer quite realise the magnitude of what he achieved this summer. Of course, any footballer would recognise that climbing the steps of the Maracana Stadium to lift the World Cup was the landmark moment in their professional lives. The subsequent public acclamation in Berlin at The Brandenburg Gate — where the victorious Germany team were greeted by more than a million fans — certainly enforced the point. Yet it was only when Neuer went on holiday that the size of the triumph became truly clear. Manuel Neuer has set his sights on winning the Champions League final staged in Germany this season . Neuer holds the trophy aloft after winning the 2014 World Cup with Germany in Brazil . Neuer holds up the Germany flag after helping his country to a fourth World Cup triumph . Germany keeper did not realise the impact of winning the World Cup until he was surrounded by fans on holiday . ‘I didn’t know how long we would be in the World Cup, so I hadn’t booked any time away beforehand,’ said the Bayern Munich goalkeeper. ‘Then I decided to go away in Europe, a last-minute holiday . ‘Never before has there been such hype when I was on holiday. I was just so surprised about what happened. Wherever I went, there were hordes of Germans. Everyone was on a high and celebrating. On holiday, everybody was asking for a photo. I loved doing it but there was not much privacy.’ Neuer is the man Manchester City must get past on Wednesday, a formidable last line of defence for Bayern and Germany. His career had already been somewhat spectacular: he won the treble of German league and cup and Champions League in 2013 and then the World Club Cup the same year; he won the league and cup double with Bayern in 2014. But the 1-0 win over Argentina is clearly the culmination of the 28-year-old’s achievements in the game. ‘As I went up the stairs in Rio to get the World Cup, my thought was, “How easy it is to climb up these stairs when you have won.” After we had lost to Chelsea (in the 2012 Champions League final) it was more like a horror story. Your legs feel heavy as lead, so does your head. It’s no fun to go up then.’ German keeper pulls off a point blank save against Karim Benzema in the quarter-final against France . Neuer (C) is unrepetant after colliding with Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain (R) during the  World Cup final . Neuer celebrates with Germany teammates among thousands of fans on their hero's return to Berlin . VIDEO All Star XI: Manuel Neuer highlights . The summer not only confirmed him as the world’s greatest goalkeeper — a worthy heir to Germany’s Sepp Maier and Oliver Kahn — but also as the pioneer of a new style. The ‘sweeper-keeper’ phrase has been around for a while but it took Neuer in the World Cup to demonstrate just what it can mean. In the 2-1 win against Algeria, when Germany were forcing the pace of the game, Neuer covered six kilometres, effectively operating as an extra member of the defence ‘I had games like that before,’ said Neuer. ‘But as far as the World Cup is concerned, it attracts more attention. People might get the impression that it was something new but a keeper remains a keeper even when he operates further up field. A keeper has to adjust his game to the team. If the team moves further up, he has to do the same. It’s nothing I’ve invented. ‘It is something that comes naturally. Everybody knows I like it and I can somehow deliver that style. But, again, it all happens because the coach wants to play a certain way and it is better for the team. ‘I have always been interested in finding new ways to play and have looked at handball keepers and ice hockey goal-minders. It helps me.’ Neuer raises the 2013 Champions League trophy after Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund in the final . The Bayern stopper celebrates winning the Bundesliga and German Cup double last season . The 28-year-old ranks Jens Lehman (L) and Edwin van der Sar (R) as his goalkeeping role models . There was of course a darker moment in the World Cup final: that charge from goal and the high-knee challenge to the face of Gonzalo Higuain. A stronger referee would have sent Neuer off and awarded a penalty, at which point the story of the summer might have had an entirely differnet conclusion. Neuer is unrepentant. ‘My opinion is still the same as it was after the game: it was no foul and no penalty. I got to the ball and he didn’t touch it at all. It was not intentional. I apologised right away. I was aware of the fact that it was a tight situation as I had to take a big risk. I had to take a decision in a split second. As a keeper you can’t be afraid. Of course I was aware afterwards that it was painful for him. I clearly went for the ball.’ His predecessor in the German goal, Kahn, has described Neuer’s style as ‘harikiri’ but Neuer is phlegmatic. ‘It can be risky, he is right as far as that is concerned. But it’s not about the keeper being a one-man show. The risk I take is one I take for the team. In the end, I’m the one to blame if it does not work. ’ His inspirations have a strong Premier League flavour and he names former Arsenal and Manchester United keepers as key influences. ‘It is something I often saw from Jens Lehmann, who won the UEFA Cup in 1997 with my former club Schalke. Internationally, I saw it from the Dutch keeper Edwin van der Sar.’ Neuer practices against Franck Ribery ahead of opening Champions League match against Manchester City . With homegrown stars like Neuer and Thomas Mulller (L), Bayern can dominate for years to come . Pep Guardiola takes a final training session ahead of Bayern Munich's clash with Manchester City . For now, there is no time for reflecting. Neuer has Wednesday's game against City and a Champions League campaign on which to focus. There is a sense that this Bayern team might emulate the Barcelona side which made up the core of Spain’s team from 2008-2012. Club and country dominated football and Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller perhaps have the capability to do the same. ‘The Bundesliga and the cup are the basics,’ said Neuer. ‘But this season we have the chance to play two finals in Berlin. Everybody wants that. It’s a great thing to play a final in your capital city.’ He is referring to the 2015 Champions League final and the German FA Cup final. It feels as though this is Bayern Munich’s time once more. Taken from an original interview by Ludger Schulze and Oliver Trust.","Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer won the 2014 World Cup with Germany .

A report into the disaster by Lord . Justice Taylor, published in 1990, found that the main reason for the . disaster was a failure of 'police control' but the Crown Prosecution . Service decided there was insufficient evidence to bring a prosecution. The victims' families say it is an . injustice that no individual or organisation has been held fully . accountable for the disaster. They believe a major incident plan was . never initiated by South Yorkshire Police and fans in the Leppings Lane . end were denied emergency medical attention. The families also dispute the . findings of an inquest into the deaths, which ruled that the victims . were all dead, or brain dead, by 3.15pm and which subsequently recorded a . verdict of accidental death. Shocking: Liverpool fans are pulled to safety on to the upper tier from the crush that was happening below at Hillsborough . Abandoned: After the cup semi was stopped Liverpool Manager Kenny Dalglish is comforted by a police officer, as he and Nottingham Forest Manager Brian Clough came off the Hillsborough pitch . Former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish, who was in charge of the club on that tragic day, said: 'I just hope that after all this time the families get a great deal of solace from whatever comes out. 'The way they have conducted themselves over the last 23 years and the dignity that they have shown has never been anything short of remarkable and they’ve got the full admiration of myself and many, many others for that. 'Now though, they need to be given the answers to the questions that they have been asking. All we can do is hope that it is as positive an outcome as possible given the difficult ­circumstances and if they are able to take some solace from the information that they receive then it will be the very least that they deserve.' Margaret Aspinall, chairwoman of the . Hillsborough Families Support Group, said they hope the documents will . answer some of the questions they have about the causes and aftermath of . the tragedy. 'This is what the families and the . fans have been fighting for 23 years. Without the truth you cannot . grieve and where there is deceit, you get no justice,' Mrs Aspinall, 65, . said. The families will see the documents . at Liverpool Cathedral and are being advised by two of Britain's best . known lawyers, Michael Mansfield QC and Lord Falconer. It is expected the families will meet in the coming days to decide what action to take, if any, following the disclosures. Painful: Margaret Aspinall, chairman  of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said that there had been 'a massively orchestrated cover-up' The panel was created by then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith following the 20th anniversary of the disaster in April 2009. Central to the panel's work is to . prepare and publish a comprehensive report based on in-depth research . into the documents to 'add to public understanding of the tragedy, its . circumstances and its aftermath'. Labour MP Andy Burnham, who has . campaigned on behalf of the families, warned that the disclosures in the . report would be ‘more shocking than many people realise.’ He said: ‘There will be many individuals with questions to answer.. But the truth will have its own power. 'I know enough about Hillsborough to . know a national apology from the Prime Minister is justified. I hope Mr . Cameron responds in the right way. 'I . get the feeling the disclosure will be more shocking than many people . realise. The closer we get, I’m confident the full truth will be told. That is an enormous thing.' History: The Mail has recently highlighted the Hillsborough families long campaign for all official papers to be disclosed . Anne Williams, who lost her 15 year old son in the tragedy, has evidence that her son was still alive at 4pm. Mr . Burnham described the cut-off point as ‘sheer cruelty’. ‘I, like the . families, cannot accept a verdict of accidental death,’ he said. The Mail has recently highlighted the Hillsborough families’ long campaign for all official papers to be disclosed. Leaked documents earlier this year found that senior officers blamed disorderly supporters just days after the disaster. In . a briefing paper seen by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, at . least one Liverpool-based policeman said he was ‘ashamed’ of the . spectators’ behaviour. The briefings contrast with the findings of the official inquiry, which pinned the blame on officers responsible for crowd control at the FA Cup semi-final at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. It said opening an exit gate just before kick-off enabled hundreds of fans to pour into a full ‘pen’ on the terraces, causing the fatal crush. The report is widely expected to hold South Yorkshire police to account for refusing to accept responsibility for the disaster and instead falsely putting the blame on drunk and ticketless Liverpool supporters. The findings are likely to trigger an overwhelming demand for fresh inquests into deaths.","96 died during 1989 FA Cup semi between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest .
