"(CNN)  -- Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button secured a McLaren one-two in a dramatic  Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday as they took advantage of a collision between Red Bull pair Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel. Polesitter Webber was leading when his German teammate tried to overtake him on lap 41 of 58 and succeeded only in crashing into him and going off. Webber, who looked set for this third straight victory, had to pit to have a new nose cone, leaving Hamilton, who had been strongly challenging in third, to take the lead from Button, the reigning world champion. The pair then engaged in their own private duel, with Button briefly heading his fellow Briton, before Hamilton took the lead for the final time to secure his first win of the season. Webber completed the podium and the third place helps him maintain the lead in the title race, five points clear of Button, with Hamilton moving up to third place, four points further adrift. The Mercedes pair of seven-time champion Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg finished a distant fourth and fifth with Robert Kubica sixth for Renault. The Ferraris of Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso were seventh and eighth, hardly an auspicious performance to mark the 800th grand prix for the famous red cars. German Adrian Sutil was ninth for Force India and Japanese Kamui Kobayashi completed the points scoring for Sauber in 10th. To complete a disappointing afternoon for Red Bull, they lost the lead to McLaren by a single point in the constructors' title race. ""A big shame for the team -- and not an ideal scenario at all,"" said Webber as he recalled the disastrous incident with Vettel. ""It can happen. He had a slight speed advantage, but he turned right into me and made contact and ... well, that was it. ""There was a long way to go and I was not guaranteed to win, but it was an interesting few meters on the track between us."" Red Bull team boss Christian Horner was not amused: ""It was very disappointing. I need to talk to both drivers. We did everything right as a team, but they should never have been there, where they were. ""It is bad for the team and we have lost a lot of points. I always ask them to give each other room, but we have handed the points on a plate to McLaren now. ""We saw Lewis and Jenson racing each other and giving each other space. That's all we ask for."" It was the McLaren team's second one-two of the season, with Button leading Hamilton home at a rain-hit Chinese Grand Prix on April 18. Hamilton was delighted to have secured his 12th career win and his first since Singapore last year. ""I don't know what happened, but they collided and we got past them and we had a bit of a battle -- a fair one, I must say - before the end,"" he said. ""It was a great result for the team and I am happy to dedicate it to my dad for his 50th birthday tomorrow.""","Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button score McLaren 1-2 in Turkish Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Two late goals from Seydou Keita and Xavi Hernandez earned 10-man Barcelona a 3-1 win over Sporting Gijon at the Nou Camp on Saturday. Barca, who were without Lionel Messi who is serving a one-match suspension for picking up five yellow cards, opened the scoring in the 42nd minute through Andres Iniesta. But when Gerard Pique saw red immediately after the break, the visitors were handed a lifeline which they duly grabbed -- David Barrel leveling the scores in the 49th minute. The home fans had to wait until the 78th minute for a breakthrough as Keita curled in a shot from the edge of the area before Xavi made sure of the three points two minutes from time. The win narrows the gap with leaders Real Madrid to seven points who host Espanyol on Sunday. In Saturday's other La Liga fixtures Malaga fought back from a goal down to beat Getafe 3-1, while Rayo Vallecano clawed back a two-goal deficit to beat 10-man Racing Santander 4-2. Osasuna are up to sixth place after a 1-1 draw against Mallorca. Meanwhile in Italy, a rapid first-half hat-trick by Zlatan Ibrahimovic helped AC Milan to a 4-0 win over Palermo at the Stadio Renzo Barbera to stay top of Serie A. The Swedish striker, who was returning after serving a three-match suspension, scored three goals in 15 minutes. His slotted home from 12 yards for his first in the 21st minute before finishing off a counter-attack ten minutes later, before lashing home his third from 20 yards 10 minutes before the break. Thiago Silva added a fourth in the 58th minute to keep the reigning champions ahead of second-placed Juventus who dropped points at home to Chievo. Paolo De Ceglie headed home from close range to give the hosts the lead after 18 minutes but they couldn't find a second goal to kill off the game. Instead it was Chievo who scored the game's second and final goal -- Boukary Drame netting in the 76th-minute. The draw means AC Milan now have a three-point cushion at the top although Juve have a game in hand.","Two late goals earn Barcelona 3-1 win over Sporting Gijon .

"(CNN) -- McLaren's Lewis Hamilton fought off fierce competition from Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber to secure his second Formula One victory of the season at the German Grand Prix. The British driver stole the lead from Red Bull's Webber off the grid, and though it changed hands several times during the race, his final pit stop was timed perfectly as he took the checkered flag 3.9 seconds ahead of Ferrari's Alonso. Webber was close behind in third and his teammate and championship leader Sebastian Vettel finished an error-laden afternoon in fourth place -- his worst finish of the season. But his lead in the drivers' championship is still 77 points over Webber, with Hamilton now third, 82 behind after his win at the Nurburgring. Latest F1 standings after German Grand Prix . Hamilton, the 2008 world champion, told reporters at a press conference: ""That was one of the best races that I have ever done. We didn't expect to come here and be so fast and really I just could not be feeling any better. ""It was just great and we have to keep pushing. These are the results that we can get - the car was really nice to drive. A fantastic job and fantastic win."" On a cool day in Germany, Hamilton started second on the grid but breezed past Webber to lead into the first corner and though the Australian passed him a few laps later the Briton regained the lead immediately. Vettel toiled on the damp track, spinning out of control as his prospects of joining the leading pack receded, while Webber again edged in front after his first pit stop saw his speed pick up. The second round of stops saw Webber push to the front again, before Alonso rounded him, only for the Spaniard to see Hamilton overtake on the outside to regain first place. Hamilton was the first into the pit lane to make the required switch onto hard tires late in the race, Alonso leading for two laps before deciding to come in. Webber led briefly, but was losing pace on his soft tires, and was forced to stop leaving Hamilton clear to take the flag and record the 16th grand prix victory of his career. Vettel struggled with his brakes for most of the race -- his home grand prix -- but was able to salvage fourth place by passing Ferrari's Felipe Massa on the penultimate lap. After the race he told reporters: ""I think fourth was probably our maximum today, which is not satisfying. We need to work harder on our car to get back on to the podium, and maybe on to the top step again."" Hamilton's teammate Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, was forced to retire for the second race in a row after his car suffered hydraulic difficulties. The next race in the Formula One calendar is the Hungarian Grand Prix next Sunday. Meanwhile in MotoGP, Casey Stoner won the U.S. Grand Prix at Laguna Seca Raceway to consolidate his lead in motorcycling's world championship standings. The Australian, riding for Repsol Honda, finished more than five seconds ahead of Jorge Lorenzo of Spain, while Dani Pedrosa was third. Stoner now has 193 championship points, 20 ahead of Lorenzo, with eight races remaining.","Lewis Hamilton wins the German Grand Prix for McLaren .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United moved to within two points of leaders Manchester City at the top of the English Premier League with a 3-1 win at third-placed Tottenham Hotspur Sunday. A Wayne Rooney goal on the stroke of half time and two second half strikes from England teammate Ashley Young knocked the stuffing out of Harry Redknapp's men. Substitute Jermain Defoe scored a late consolation for the well-beaten home side, who had started brightly. Emmanuel Adebayor forced a fine save from David de Gea and had a goal ruled out for handball before Rooney took advantage to head home from Young's corner after slack home defending. Chelsea sack Villas-Boas . De Gea made a superb reaction save from a deflected Jake Livermore drive as Tottenham pressed for a deserved equalizer and Adebayor went down in the area, appealing in vain for a penalty. But United broke upfield and Kyle Walker miscued his clearance from Nani's cross straight to Young, who volleyed in from the angle. Thomas: Abramovich was right to sack AVB . Almost immediately, Young made it 3-0 as he made space for himself to curl a shot past Brad Friedel. Defoe, left on the bench with Louis Saha preferred, may have made a point to Redknapp with a fine 20-yard strike to cut the deficit but it was academic. After a 5-2 defeat to north London rivals Arsenal last Sunday, the early promise of Tottenham's season is eroding, but champions United continue to put pressure on their archrivals at the top of the league. The pair meet on April 20 in a clash which looks likely to decide the outcome of the title this season. United manager Alex Ferguson was delighted by his team's display at White Hart Lane. ""A battling performance today tells you that we are up for it,"" he told Sky Sports. He added: ""It's an entirely unbelievable result. I would say that's our . hardest away game of the season."" Earlier, Newcastle United salvaged a 1-1 draw in an action-packed north east derby against Sunderland. Shola Ameobi's injury-time equalizer rescued a point for the home side at St James' Park -- his seventh goal against their bitter local rivals. Nicklas Bendtner's first-half penalty put Sunderland ahead but the visitors had Stephane Sessegnon sent off for elbowing Cheik Tiote with half an hour left. Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet produced a stunning save to keep out Demba Ba's 83rd-minute penalty for Newcastle, who looked to be heading for defeat until Ameobi's late strike. Sunderland captain Lee Cattermole, who was cautioned after just 40 seconds of the match, was shown a straight red card after the final whistle for dissent. Fulham increased Wolverhampton Wanderers' problems with a 5-0 beating of the relegation candidates at Craven Cottage. Russian star Pavel Pogrebnyak, on loan from Stuttgart, grabbed a hat-trick, making it five in three games since his move, while Clint Dempsey scored twice.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid extended their lead at the top of La Liga to seven points on Saturday after they won against Real Zaragoza and rivals Barcelona only drew away to Villarreal. Jose Mourinho's men enjoyed a comfortable 3-1 win at the Bernabeu although they had to come from behind. Angel Lafita gave bottom-placed side Zaragoza an early lead with an 11th minute strike but a goal from Kaka after half an hour gave Real a deserved equalizer. The home side wasted little time establishing their dominance in the second half with Cristiano Ronaldo putting them in front in the 49th minute. Mesut Ozil doubled the lead seven minutes later to wrap up the three points. Meanwhile, Barcelona couldn't find a way to unlock the defence of La Liga strugglers Villarreal. The result continues a mixed bag of a season away from home which has now yielded five draws, four wins and one loss. A Vladimir Weiss goal earned Espanyol a 1-0 win over 10-man Mallorca. The result moves them level on points with fourth-placed Levante who host Getafe on Sunday. Fernando Llorente scored a hat-trick for Athletic Bilbao as they came from behind to beat Rayo Vallecano 3-2. Miguel Cuesta gave the home side the lead in the 10th minute before Llorente struck in the 17th and 23rd minute. Alejandro Arribas squared things up four minutes later but Llorente was on hand in the 68th minute to grab the winner. Meanwhile in Serie A, leaders Juventus beat Udinese 2-1 in Turin to keep their title charge on track.

"(CNN) -- HBO's new political docudrama ""Game Change"" isn't just any made-for-TV movie inspired by reality. The film explores the behind-the-scenes decision-making process that guided the 2008 McCain/Palin presidential ticket, and the human qualities of both candidates. Director Jay Roach (""Austin Powers,"" ""Meet the Parents"") didn't want to just rehash the story lines that dominated the news that fall. In addition to some of the widely publicized stories -- from the vetting process to the Katie Couric interview and the ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches -- ""Game Change"" shows how the campaign staffers, particularly Steve Schmidt (played by Woody Harrelson), tried to control the candidates' perceptions of themselves and counter Barack Obama's platform. ""It's interesting that politicians are forced to study perpetually their own media depictions as well as focus on the issues and what they actually care about,"" Roach told CNN. ""I'm fascinated by the spin doctors. That whole culture of behind-the-scenes, occasionally dark art, or message management and campaign strategy is just fascinating. I hope this film could tap into (it), and raises questions about it."" ""Game Change,"" which premieres Saturday at 9 p.m., stars Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin and Ed Harris as John McCain. Here's what Roach told CNN about the film: . CNN: Palin and McCain associates have labeled the film as an inaccurate attack. Why would they say this? Jay Roach: No, that's the big question. It's tough to even respond when you hear people criticize something they haven't seen. Obviously they've seen the trailer and read the book, so it's not a huge surprise that they'd take issue with it. I wish they'd see the film because it has a very evenhanded tone to it, in trying to get the story right and allow anybody with any prejudices against the main characters to go past the media iconography and see them as human beings. They are human beings who are trying to do what they think is right. They have strengths and they have weaknesses. One of the things that makes McCain more relatable is the fact that he curses a lot. I thought so. Even when I was reading the book I had that reaction. You don't get to see behind the scenes. I've been around enough people in politics that it's not that uncommon. But it is jarring when you see a senator for decades go off like that. I asked (""Game Change"" authors) Heilemann and Halperin if that was for real and were they just spicing up their book. They said, ""No, no. We might be under-representing it."" Keep in mind, he's a fighter pilot. He grew up in a military family. I agree with you, it did make him seem more human. The film presents the idea that politicians are constructed by mass media and that's what makes or breaks them. We're all in a culture where we all are increasingly putting out a media version of ourselves, whether on Facebook or our tweets. It is unique in politics how much it's become about managing an avatar version of the candidate in the public. You have to be fascinated by what the contrast is to that: the iconic version of that person versus what they're dealing with as human beings. In certain ways, they're even more transparent because they're being followed 24 hours a day. But in another way, they're much less transparent because their guard is so much up and the image makers are so busy adjusting it. That's what hooked me so much to this film. Tina Fey famously spoofed Palin during the election cycle. Did you and Julianne consult with her at all about playing Palin? No, we didn't. We made a deliberate choice to separate what Julianne was going to do from what Tina had done. What (Fey) did was powerful and kind of brilliant. Often using Sarah Palin's own words, she was able to point out that Palin wasn't prepared well and she didn't have time really to get properly schooled, if you will. We were also constantly aware of people's perception that we may go somewhere towards the Tina Fey version. Some people were very critical of Palin. Was it important to you to understand those people who did connect with her? Many members of my close family are Sarah Palin fans. In fact, I got e-mails from them when it was announced and they said, ""Don't pick on Sarah."" So I had access to a number of people who were not just admirers, but fully committed, devoted people. (Palin) spoke to people's disenchantment with politicians in general, how things work in government and feeling, to some extent, cut off from being able to do anything about it. That's understandable. There were things about her in 2008 that were impressive. She had 80% popularity. She did take on oil interests in Alaska and raised taxes on the oil companies and was able to give checks back to people in Alaska. She really was a maverick, a charismatic mother of five, and was sending her son off to Iraq. She really was a person who started her political career fighting for local issues she cared about. There were a lot of things that drew people to her immediately. And once you're hooked on that, then it was completely understandable that people became followers.","""Game Change"" explores the decision-making process of the 2008 GOP ticket .

"(CNN) -- Egypt and Algeria will have to face each other again in a winner-takes-all World Cup playoff match after Emad Moteab scored a dramatic goal in the fifth minute of injury time to give the Pharaohs a 2-0 win in Cairo. Amr Zaki had put Egypt ahead in the second minute in the Group Three clash but Algeria's defense stood firm and they looked set to progress to the tournament in South Africa as the clock ticked past the 90-minute mark. But Moteab scored a sensational second goal which ensured the teams have identical qualifying records and will have to play again in a special one-off match in Sudan on Wednesday. In Group Two, Obafemi Martins struck twice to help Nigeria record a 3-2 victory over Kenya in Nairobi and clinch their place at the finals. Dennis Oliech had given Kenya the lead at half-time after his opened the scoring in the 16th minute but Wolfsburg striker Martins helped the 'Super Eagles' hit back as he equalized in the 62nd minute. Everton forward Aiyegbeni Yakubu put Nigeria ahead but Nigeria's were pegged back in the 78th minute when Allan Watende punished some poor defending. But Martins hit the winner in the 83rd minute when he swiveled and struck his shot past Kenya goalkeeper Willis Ochieng and into the net. Nigeria only secured their fourth appearance at the finals after they leapfrogged Tunisia -- who slipped to a 1-0 defeat to Mozambique -- to finish a point ahead of them at the top of Group Two. Dario Monteiro was the hero for Mozambique when he grabbed the winner in Maputo in the 83rd minute after he beat the offside trap and slammed the ball home from the edge of the penalty area. Paul Le Guen's Cameroon booked their place with a 2-0 win over Morocco in Group One while Gabon's dreams of qualification ended with a 1-0 defeat in Togo. Achille Webo and Samuel Eto were both on the scoresheet for the 'Indomitable Lions' who will set a new African record of six World Cup appearances in South Africa. Webo opened the scoring for Cameroon in Fez in the 18th minute when his left-footed shot cannoned into the net off the post. Inter Milan striker Eto'o effectively made the result safe in the 52nd minute when he headed home Geremi's corner as Cameroon finished top of the group. Gabon's slim hopes of qualifying were dependent on Cameroon slipping up but ultimately their campaign ended in defeat to Togo. Lome Floyd Ayite struck in the dying moments which rubberstamped Togo's place at the African Nations Cup in Angola. Sudan's woeful run continued as they slipped to 2-1 home defeat to Benin and ended their Group Four campaign with just one point. A Razak Omotoyossi penalty gave Benin the lead before Mudathir El Tahir also converted from the spot but Romuald Boco gave the visitors the points. In Group Five, Ivory Coast ended their campaign unbeaten after they cruised to a 3-0 victory over Guinea in Abidjan thanks to two goals from Gervinho and one from Siaka Tiene. Malawi qualified for only their second ever African Nations Cup despite a 1-0 defeat to Burkina Faso with Moumouni Dagano on target in Ouagadougou.","Egypt and Algeria will face a special one-off World Cup playoff match after the hosts claimed a dramatic 2-0 win in Cairo .

"U.S. military planners quietly have stepped up a review of alternatives in case the Turkish government restricts U.S. access to Turkish airspace or cuts off access to the air base at Incirlik, Turkey, CNN has learned. U.S. Air Force planes prepare to take off in November 2001 from the air base at Incirlik, Turkey. Turkey has threatened such action after congressional moves to declare that the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in World War I was ""genocide."" Turkey -- now a NATO member and a key U.S. ally in the war on terror -- accepts Armenians were killed but calls it a massacre during a chaotic time, not an organized campaign of genocide. The recent rise in tensions between Turkey and the United States has led the military to increase its planning for alternatives, two military officials with direct knowledge of the ongoing assessment said. ""Events have triggered more detailed planning for the curtailment or closure"" of access to Turkey, one official said. The key issue is to find ways to ship supplies and other critical equipment into Iraq. The U.S. military already had been considering alternatives to Turkey because of the growing dependence on that country after the cutback of U.S. forces in central Asia in recent years. But now, with more ""detailed planning"" under way, the military is considering a variety of options in hopes of being ready for whatever, if anything, the Turks do. U.S. officials say Turkey's options range from a complete cutoff, including ending overland access routes from southern Turkey into Iraq, to less drastic options that simply restrict U.S. access. The initial assessment is that any cutoff from current access to Turkey would force the U.S. military into longer cargo flights, which would mean extra costs for fuel and for wear and tear on equipment. It may also look for other air hubs in Jordan or Kuwait, officials say.  See Turkey's strategic position » . Defense Secretary Robert Gates earlier this week pointed out, ""Seventy percent of the air cargo, American air cargo, going into Iraq goes through Turkey. Seventy percent of the fuel that goes in for our forces goes in ... through Turkey ... ""For those who are concerned that we get as many of these mine-resistant ambush-protected heavy vehicles into Iraq as possible, 95 percent of those vehicles today are being flown into Iraq through Turkey."" Turkey on Thursday recalled its ambassador to the United States and warned of repercussions in the growing dispute. On Wednesday, in a 27-21 vote, the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs passed the measure labeling the killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turkish forces ""genocide."" President Bush and key administration figures lobbied hard against the measure, saying it would create unnecessary headaches for U.S. relations with Turkey. The full House could soon vote on the genocide resolution. A top Turkish official warned Thursday that consequences ""won't be pleasant"" if it approves the measure. The resolution arrives at a particularly sensitive point in U.S.-Turkish relations. The United States has urged Turkey not to send its troops over the border into northern Iraq to fight Kurdish separatist rebels, who launched some cross-border attacks against Turkish targets.

"(CNN) -- Gavin DeGraw is a New York state native who now calls Nashville home. That is, when the singer/songwriter's not on the road -- which is rare these days. DeGraw is currently out on tour to promote his new album, ""Sweeter."" When he does get a break from touring, he heads back down South to Nashville. He took a little time out to share a few suggestions on what to do if you find yourself in Music City. Robert's Western World . On downtown Nashville's main drag, this live music venue -- where there's never a cover charge -- bills itself as ""Nashville's undisputed home of traditional country music."" ""(It's) my favorite honky tonk on Broadway. Music and atmosphere is hard to beat. Just show up at any random time. ... Some of the best musicians on the strip play on that stage,"" says DeGraw. Robert's Western World is open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. and Sundays from 12 p.m. to 3 a.m. Loveless Cafe . ""This place is a must,"" DeGraw says. ""You feel like you are eating at your grandma's house when you walk into this place. Anything you order is going to feel like your grandma made it. The biscuits are a must!"" The Loveless Cafe was originally a motel and cafe owned by Lon and Annie Loveless. While it has grown significantly since 1951 and given up the motel end of the business, the cafe still serves its famous fried chicken and Annie Loveless' secret recipe biscuits that DeGraw loves so much. The Pancake Pantry . Just like the Loveless Cafe, The Pancake Pantry has long been a Nashville staple. The popular family-owned eatery opened in 1961. In addition to its famous pancakes -- from orange-walnut to pigs in a blanket and chocolate sin -- the pantry boasts about its secret recipe syrups. DeGraw has a tip for visiting this popular Nashville landmark: ""The key here is to go in the middle of the week or you're going to be waiting for hours. Another great place to catch up with friends and family and even though they are always busy, they never rush you out."" Tootsies Orchid Lounge . This Broadway honky tonk is also a DeGraw favorite. ""This place has so much history. So many of the legendary country artists have performed and hung out at Tootsies ... Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Mel Tillis, Kris Kristofferson, Roger Miller, Patsy Cline,"" says DeGraw. Tootsies, like Robert's Western World, holds a place in Nashville honky-tonk history. Legend has it that original owner Tootsie Bess used to slip $5 and $10 bills to struggling songwriters and that she kept a box of IOU's behind the counter to make sure that they could drink and eat as well. At the end of each year a group of Grand Ole Opry performers would come and pay the IOU tab so Tootsie wasn't out the money. Losers . The dive bar Losers will draw a much more local and diverse crowd than Tootsies and Robert's Western World. It's also very close to Vanderbilt University, so it's popular with the college crowd. ""I like this place because this is a local musician joint that is not necessarily country,"" DeGraw says, explaining why it's on his list of favorites. ""My musician friends who aren't on the road stop into this place from time to time, as do I.""","Singer/songwriter Gavin DeGraw is a Nashville resident .

"(CNN)  -- Lindsey Vonn of the United States continued her dream finish to the season with victory in the super-G at the World Cup finals in Are on Thursday -- clinching the overall title in the discipline. Vonn has claimed two crystal globes in two days with successive victories in Are. It was the second crystal globe in two days for the 24-year-old from Minnesota, who had won the downhill title on Wednesday with another commanding victory, clinching the World Cup overall crown at the same time. Vonn trailed Switzerland's Fabienne Suter by 15 points going into the final super-G of the season and her cause was helped as Suter produced a disappointing run which eventually saw her finish eighth. Nadia Fancini of Italy gave herself a chance of taking the overall super-G title by taking the lead from German Maria Riesch with a fine run on the Olympia piste. But Vonn was not to be denied and edged out Fanchini by 0.08 seconds with a time of one minute 20.63 seconds. Riesch, who had been her main challenger for overall honors, finished third. Fanchini had the minor consolation of pipping Suter for second place in the super-G standings, 45 points behind Vonn. Vonn, who won golds in the world championships last month in downhill and super-G, has now racked up 1788 points in World Cup racing this season and is closing on the all-time record of 1970 by Janica Kostelic in 2006.

"(CNN) -- Authorities were using military helicopters and a C-130 cargo plane Sunday to evacuate thousands of residents stranded by rising floodwaters in the eastern Australian state of Queensland, the government said. Heavy rains in recent weeks have swollen rivers beyond their banks, threatening a number of communities in Queensland and New South Wales. Authorities were using the plane and helicopters to evacuate patients from a hospital in particularly hard-hit Queensland town of St. George, where officials were warning about 4,000 residents to get out of the path of what officials say will be a record-breaking flood. ""This is a very serious situation and I urge people to cooperate,'' Queensland Premier Anna Bligh told CNN affiliate Nine Network. The Balonne River is expected to crest Monday at 15 meters (49.2 feet), swamping the town of St. George. Prime Minister Julia Gillard said authorities were coordinating calls for assistance. """"Emergency Management Australia has liaison officers in flood-affected regions to ensure that requests for any further assistance can be actioned immediately,"" Gillard said in a statement. Food and medical supplies have been flown to isolated communities elsewhere in Queensland, authorities said. Rescue workers on Sunday recovered the body of a woman who died trying to drive her pickup through floodwaters, authorities said. Jane Sheahan was swept away Friday in the Queensland town of Roma, authorities said. Witnesses told CNN affiliate Nine Network that Sheahan managed to hand off her 7-year-old son, Darcy, to a would-be rescuer before she was swept away. In the neighboring province of New South Wales, thousands of people remained isolated despite reports of receding floodwaters in some areas. Emergency officials lifted a number of evacuations ordered evacuations early Sunday, though they warned residents not to walk, drive or swim in the receding waters. Flood waters have started to recede around North Moree after five days of major flooding, the New South Wales Emergency Services said, but many of the town's streets remain closed. Aerial assessments show some 300 homes and businesses have been inundated -- making it the worst flooding in nearly 60 years, CNN affiliate Seven Network reported. Major flooding has also affected communities along the Namoi River, where the town of Wee Waa has been cut off, the New South Wales Emergency Services said. Major flooding is expected to continue there until the middle of this week. Other communities affected by the Namoi River include Boggoabri, Narrabri Bugilbone and Goangra, with flood waters closing roads and inundating some rural properties.","Authorities: Military helicopters and cargo plane used to evacuate patients at hospital .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- One year after a devastating earthquake and tsunami struck northeast Japan, killing nearly 16,000 people and sparking the world's worst nuclear crisis in 25 years, the country will pause Sunday to remember the exact moment the earth shook. At exactly 2:46 p.m. local time (12:46 a.m. ET), a moment of silence will be held to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the 9.0-magnitude quake -- a tremor so great, it literally shifted the earth's axis. Observances will be held across the country, with a main ceremony at the New National Theatre in Tokyo. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda is expected to attend that event and offer remarks. He spoke to CNN recently about the country's rebuilding efforts, which represent Japan's greatest challenge since the end of World War II. Total damage has been estimated at about 25 million yen, or roughly $300 billion so far. ""The Japanese people are united in working with the government to put all our might towards working on the reconstruction,"" Noda said this month. Read iReporters' reflections on the anniversary . ""The debris cleanup, the building of temporary houses and daily support for the disaster victims -- we have been making steady progress on all those issues,"" he said. Besides wrecking havoc itself, the earthquake triggered one of the worst tsunamis in recent years, unleashing a wall of water that swept away lives, homes and sent millions of people fleeing for higher ground. Read Banana Yoshimoto's piece on living after the disaster . Japan also found itself dealing with the worst nuclear crisis since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the quake's wake. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility was knocked offline, resulting in a meltdown of three reactors, with radiation leaking into the air and contaminated water spilling into the sea. While no deaths were attributed to the nuclear disaster, more than 100,000 people remain displaced from the towns where its long-lived fallout settled. Read what the Fukushima accident did to the ocean . One year on, Japan is far from dug out of the destruction wrought by the triple disaster, which killed nearly 16,000 people. More than 3,000 others are still missing. But the country, the prime minister said, is committed to rebuilding and emerging as a strengthened nation. Read about the 'low-tech' disaster cleanup .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Hundreds of Indonesian police officers charged into a prison in Bali on Wednesday to subdue rioting inmates who had set a building on fire and thrown stones at firefighters. The police arrived at Kerobokan Prison late Tuesday to ensure that no prisoners escaped during the rioting, said Ketut Untung Sayoga, the deputy chief of police in Bali, but did not enter the facility until daylight broke Wednesday. Three inmates were wounded, one of them shot in the leg by a rubber bullet, Sayoga said. The riot took place in a separate block from the one housing foreign inmates. None of the 60 foreign prisoners were harmed, Sayoga said. The prison is where Schapelle Corby, an Australian beauty therapist convicted in 2005 of smuggling nine pounds of marijuana into Bali, is serving a 20 year prison sentence. The 12 Australians in the prison were unharmed, said Ray Marcelo, a public affairs official at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. Kerobokan Prison is in southern Bali, a few kilometers from Denpasar Airport and the popular tourist area of Kuta. It appeared to be under control Wednesday but remained heavily guarded.","Three inmates are wounded after police storm a prison in Bali .

"MELBOURNE, Australia -- Serbian third seed Novak Djokovic claimed a dramatic triumph at the Australian Open when he defeated unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 4-6 6-4 6-3 7-6 in Sunday's final. Sealed with a kiss: Djokovic clutches the trophy after clinching his first Grand Slam triumph in Melbourne. Djokovic's first Grand Slam victory gave his country its first 'major' triumph, but he had to battle all the way against surprise package Tsonga who enjoyed the support of the crowd. The 20-year-old Djokovic had not lost a set in six matches including his stunning success against hat-trick chasing holder Roger Federer in the semifinals. But with Muhammad Ali lookalike Tsonga coming out swinging as he did in his straight-sets upset over second seed Rafael Nadal in their last-four clash, that streak came to a sudden end when the Frenchman broke twice to take the opener in 49 minutes. The 20-year-old Djokovic rebounded in the second and third sets and after saving a crucial breakpoint in the fourth, clinched his first major at the 13th attempt. ""You feel the expectations and pressure, so I'm very happy with the way I dealt with the pressure,"" Djokovic said. ""Coming on against a player with nothing to lose -- he was going for the shots and he was very dangerous, especially in the first set -- I was pretty nervous."" He is the youngest player to win the title since Stefan Edberg defeated Mats Wilander in 1985 -- and as well as Tsonga, the Serb also had to overcome cramps. Djokovic got treatment on the back of his left thigh while holding for a 3-2 lead in the fourth set, then fended off a break point while serving at 5-5. Wanting to finish it off quickly, he raced through the tiebreaker -- with some help from Tsonga, who double-faulted to make it 5-1 and then sent a running forehand long to give his rival four championship points. Djokovic only needed one as Tsonga hit a forehand wide -- and the relief was there for all to see. Djokovic fell on his back, then got up to shake hands with Tsonga and put his arm around the Frenchman. He got on his knees and kissed the court, shook hands with his family, then tossed two rackets into the stands before burying his face in a towel. ""First, before I thank everybody in this world, I want to thank everybody in my box, who've supported me all the way through, not just these two weeks, all the way in my life,"" Djokovic said at the presentation. ""Thank you very much, I love you. ""Second of course Jo. Unbelievable tournament and you should be proud of yourself -- if he won tonight it would be absolutely deserved, so well done for his success."" Djokovic, who has had a hot and cold relationship with the Melbourne Park crowd, won them back over again in his post-match speech. ""I know the crowd wanted him to win more,"" he said of Tsonga. ""That's OK, it's all right. I still love you guys, don't worry. ""I'm very, very happy that I won my first Grand Slam here, so hopefully we'll see you here on this stage a lot more often in the future."" Tsonga, ranked 38th, was playing his fifth Grand Slam tournament and had never previously gone beyond the fourth round. He was aiming to be the first Frenchman in 80 years to win the Australian title and the first to win any of the four Grand Slams since Yannick Noah's win at Roland Garros in 1983. Instead it was Djokovic who made the headlines. ""I am so proud of myself and to be the first Serbian who won the Grand Slam title,"" he said. ""I think it will be a crazy house back in Serbia in my country, I love you guys.""  E-mail to a friend .","Serbian third seed Novak Djokovic claims dramatic triumph at Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- It wasn't the sight of tortured bodies that scared ""Chuy."" It was what was written on the sign that was left next to them. ""This will happen to all the Internet snitches."" It was signed by Los Zetas. The banner was placed next to the two victims, a woman and man, both in their 20s, both gruesomely killed. The woman was disemboweled, left with her intestines protruding from her belly. They were found in September 2011, hanging from a bridge in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, robbed of any future dignity. About three hours away in Reynosa, Chuy's stomach grumbled when he saw the banner on the Internet. ""Those people hanging from the bridge could have been me,"" he thought. Mexico: A deadly beat . For the past two years, Chuy has taken to Twitter to act as a tipster to cartel activity in his town. When local and state authorities tried to downplay news about the cartels operating in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas (at one point the government attributed the tension to the ""psychosis of the residents"") Chuy was one of the first people on social media to tip the world about what was really happening. His news of ""narco blockades"" and gun fights throughout Reynosa in late February 2010 was among the first news people received about the fresh war that erupted between Los Zetas and the Gulf cartel. He has become such a trustworthy source of information that the social media savvy residents of Reynosa head to his account to find what places to avoid before leaving their homes. Others trapped in the street after gunfights look to him to offer alternate ways to get home. His account has become both a tool of information and survival. He asked CNN not to use his name to protect his identity. ""During an attack, the network goes beyond Twitter. People on the street send me an SMS alert, a radio alert or a phone call to let me know what's going on,"" Chuy says of his role of protecting Reynosa's innocent. ""We continue to report after the attack to cover the information gap by the local press. ""Thanks to Twitter we have documentation, with video, audio and images, of violent events,"" he says. ""It's a registration [countering the] opacity and denial of local and state government. ""Many people have trusted me and I appreciate it,"" he says. ""It's very rewarding and a great responsibility that motivates me to make sure I use Twitter properly ... as a tool of social utility."" Chuy is well aware of his responsibility. The short description on his Twitter account makes that clear, ""A society [that is] selfish, apathetic, indifferent has no moral authority, it is more comfortable complaining, blaming, criticizing than participating [to] contribute, [to] build..."" Inspired in part by the ""Green Revolution"" in Iran, Mexican citizens became increasingly active on the social media site in 2010 as a way to combat the drug violence infesting their cities. Lacking confidence in their local authorities, they took Twitter to ""spread truth,"" denounce cartels and warn each other of shootouts. On YouTube, a video titled ""Cartel De Twitter"" gives guidance on how to create anonymous Twitter accounts so users can announce where cartels are operating. It gives examples of how to circulate information to a wider audience by using hashtags and how to direct tweets to legitimate journalists on Twitter. In some cities of Mexico -- especially in the northern part of the country -- cartels have used violence and intimidation to control swaths of land and smuggling routes in their unquenchable quest for money and power. Their assault on Mexican bloggers seemingly takes aim at controlling cyberspace as well. For many within the blogging community the development comes as no surprise. Some were even anticipating it. Chuy wasn't always so plugged in. Before the cartels used his town as their battlefield, he spent the majority of his days at work. Born into a family of traders in Mexico City, he moved to Reynosa a few years ago to follow his passion and open up his own store. He would use the Internet sparingly, most of the time to play games or stay in touch with friends back home in the capital. He has always been low key, passing the time at weekend carne asadas with friends or going to the movies. Life is radically different now. ""I avoid the street at night,"" he says of the unofficial curfew local residents adhere to in Reynosa. He speaks in a hushed tone, choosing his words carefully before delivering them. His voice is delicate, but soaked in concern. ""If you go to a party, you sleep there. If not, you might suffer an attack by armed civilians if you come across the wrong people on your way home."" In Reynosa, the bad guys aren't always so easily recognizable. Chuy says most residents are suspicious of the public security forces. ""They will, under any pretext, extort you,"" he says of the authorities. About a year ago the hashtags frequented by Chuy were saturated with tweets about his confrontation with the local police. His friends messaged the media, asking for news outlets to cover the assault. They cited it as a microcosm for what everyday residents go through. When asked by CNN what happened, Chuy downplayed the incident, saying instead it's what to be expected ""in the environment of corruption and war."" ""They roughed me up outside of my store ... The police are the more visible arm of the local cartel,"" he says, as if asked to state the obvious. ""Everyone knows that."" When asked about the specific allegations of corruption, CNN was referred by local authorities to the Tamaulipas Attorney General's Office. After repeated requests for an interview, CNN did not receive a response. In past interviews conducted by CNN with attorney general's spokesman Ruben Dario Rios, similar allegations of abuse among local and state officials were denied. Chuy says the incident with the police was the only ""direct threat"" he's received. But in a part of the world where talking about threats is enough to get you killed, it's no surprise he is shy when the subject comes up. ""I think there is a real risk [to my life]"", he says. ""Sometimes you get that feeling, so you have to maintain a low profile. In Reynosa, one slip-up can cost a lot. It's not a place where people feel comfortable asking the police for help staying safe,"" he says. As for those who are trying to keep people like him silent, Chuy addresses it with indignation. His defiance is clear with every tweet he sends. ""They try to silence the voice of citizens with their organization through fear, terror,"" he says. ""Obviously what we do affects the interests of the cartel and local government. But the citizens have found a way to organize and protect each other on Twitter. The police and authorities ... they don't care. So you find a way take care of them.""","Some local news outlets downplay Mexico cartel violence .

"(CNN) -- Coach Sergio Batista has paid the price for Argentina's unsuccessful 2011 Copa America campaign after having his contract canceled on Monday. Expectations had been high with Argentina hosting the tournament and seeking a record 15th title, but ""La Albiceleste"" lost on penalties in the quarterfinals to neighbors Uruguay -- who went on to claim that milestone instead. Batista, a World Cup winner as a player in 1986, replaced the iconic Diego Maradona as coach in July 2010, having previously guided his country's Olympic team to a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Games. The Argentine Football Association (AFA) hopes to announce a successor to the 48-year-old former Argentinos Juniors boss within a week. Copa America flops: Who is to blame? ""The national teams committee has decided to rescind the contract that attached Mr. Batista with the Argentinian Football Association,"" AFA spokesman Ernesto Cherquis Bialo told reporters. ""In a very good-natured, mature telephone conversation, Mr. Batista and Mr. Julio Grondona (the AFA president) talked and Batista left his situation in the hands of the AFA. ""Batista is a man who does not need any explanation. He talked to the AFA president and allowed him to decide whatever he considers the right thing."" Cherquis Bialo said the AFA would now take time to consider potential candidates to replace Batista. ""In the upcoming seven days, we hope we can reveal the name of the new coach. The candidates' names will be evaluated by the national teams committee,"" he said. The main objective for the new head coach will be qualification for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, a campaign which begins on October 7 with a home match against Chile. Also at Monday's press conference, the AFA announced sweeping changes to the structure of league football in Argentina. Has Argentine football reached crisis point? The country's top division currently consists of 20 teams, with each year split into two championship seasons. Each team plays each other once to decide the winner of the first competition, known as the Apertura, with the return fixtures making up the second championship, the Clausura. However, the new regulations with see the country's top two divisions combined from the start of the 2012-13 campaign to create a 38-team league. The new format will see teams compete for the title over a full season, eliminating the Apertura and Clausura system. It is also spells the end of the Primera Division's current relegation format, which sees teams relegated based on their points over three Apertura and Clausura seasons. The 33-time national champions River Plate suffered relegation under the current rules for the first time in their history in June, and CNN correspondent Brian Byrnes believe the plight of the Buenos Aires outfit may have brought about these changes. ""A lot of people reacted very badly to that,"" Byrnes said of River's relegation. ""They knew a lot of lost revenue was going to come as a result of River playing in the B league. ""So we're hearing that authorities both at the AFA and even the Argentine government were involved in the decision to combine the two leagues. ""It's not clear yet how they are going to sort out the scoring or how it is going to affect international competitions, such as they Copa Libertadores and the Copa Sudamericana.""","Argentine FA rescinds the contract of national coach Sergio Batista .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United went top of the English Premier League on Saturday with a 2-1 win over Liverpool at Old Trafford, but it was Luis Suarez who grabbed the headlines again. Suarez, who was starting his first match since returning from an eight-match ban for racially abusing United defender Patrice Evra last October, refused to shake the French international's hand as the team's lined up before the match. Suarez fined, suspended over racist remarks . It was the precursor to a fractious encounter with both sets of players reportedly clashing in the tunnel at halftime and having to be restrained after the final whistle. On the pitch, the game was ignited by Wayne Rooney who struck twice in three minutes at the start of the second half after a goalless first period. The England striker volleyed home in the 47th minute before latching on to a Antonio Valencia pass moments later to slot the ball past Pepe Reina. Liverpool's attempts to half the deficit were rewarded with a Suarez goal in the 80th minute but a spirited search for an equalizer ended in vain. The arguments over the handshake incident went on after the match. Alex Ferguson called Suarez ""a disgrace"" saying he should never be allowed to represent the Merseyside club again. Reds' boss Dalglish refused to be drawn on the issue saying he hadn't see it. The loss keeps Liverpool in seventh place on 39 points while United now have 58 points, one point more than Manchester City who travel to Aston Villa on Sunday. Harry Redknapp capped a highly satisfying week as he watched his Tottenham Hotspur side thrash Newcastle United 5-0 at White Hart Lane. Benoit Assou-Ekotto opened the scoring in the fourth minute, with recent signing Louis Saha doubling the lead two minutes later. Saha was on target again in the 20th minute with Niko Kranjcar adding a fourth ten minutes before halftime. Emmanuel Adebayor made it five in the 64th minute to complete the rout. The win consolidates Spurs' grip on third place while leaving them five points behind leaders Manchester United. Chelsea slipped out of the top four as they lost to Everton 2-0 at Goodison Park. Steven Peinaar put the Toffees ahead in the fifth minute with Denis Stracqualursi adding a second midway through the second half. The result moves Everton up to 10th with 33 points while Chelsea drop to fifth behind Arsenal who beat Sunderland 2-1 at the Stadium of Light. Thierry Henry's strike in stoppage time saw Arsene Wenger's team take all three points after going behind to a goal from James Mclean in the 70th minute. Aaron Ramsey put the Gunners back on level terms before a volley by on-loan Henry sealed a dramatic victory and Martin O'Neill's first home defeat since taking over as Sunderland boss in December last year. Blackburn Rovers bounced back from their 7-1 thrashing at the hands of Arsenal last week with a 3-2 win over Queens Park Rangers at Ewood Park. First-half goals from French midfielder Steven Nzonzi, Yakubu and an own goal from Nedum Onuoha proved enough to defeat Mark Hughes side despite two second half goals from his Scottish striker Jamie Mackie. The win lifts Blackburn to 18th level on 21 points with QPR who are two places higher thanks to a superior goal difference. Bottom-of-the-table Wigan also enjoyed a rare victory defeating Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium. Scottish defender Gary Caldwell put Wigan in front two minutes before the break. Mark Davies equalised in the 67th minute for Bolton but James McArthur's 76th minute tap-in sealed Wigan's fourth league win of the season. Roberto Martinez's team remain in last place but are now only one point adrift of Bolton who switch places with Blackburn. Norwich City are up to eighth in the table after beating Swansea City 3-2 at the Liberty Stadium. Danny Graham put the hosts ahead in the 23rd minute before the Canaries hit back with three second-half goals -- two from striker Grant Holt, the other from Anthony Pilkington. Graham got his second of the match for Swansea three minutes from the end but it couldn't deny Norwich their ninth league win of the season. Fulham moved level on 30 points with Stoke City after they beat Tony Pulis' side at Craven Cottage. Pavel Pogrebnyak gave the Cottagers the lead in the 16th minute. Twelve minutes later Clint Dempsey's strike was tipped onto the bar by Danish keeper Thomas Sorensen who then saw the ball rebound back onto him and into the net. Ryan Shawcross pulled one back for Stoke in the 78th minute but Fulham held on for all three points.","Luis Suarez and Patrice Evra feud ignited as Man Utd and Liverpool clash at Old Trafford .

"Washington (CNN) -- After years of criticism, the Transportation Security Administration is taking the initial steps to modify screening for people age 75 or older. Beginning Monday, the TSA will test procedures allowing those passengers to leave their shoes on, as well as light outerwear. Other changes are intended to reduce the likelihood that older passengers will be subjected to a pat-down. Some airports want private screeners . The tests will be conducted at four airports: Chicago's O'Hare, Denver International, Portland International in Oregon, and Orlando International. If they are successful, the TSA could expand the procedures to checkpoints nationwide. The new protocols closely parallel changes implemented last fall for passengers age 12 and under, and for the same reason -- intelligence indicates that they are unlikely to be involved in a terrorist attack, the TSA said. TSA spokesman Greg Soule said the agency is trying to ""move away from the one-size-fits-all approach"" to security screening. The changes will manage risk, but not eliminate it, he said. FAA changes safety reporting culture . At the selected checkpoints, passengers 75 and older will be allowed to leave their shoes and light outerwear on. If the full-body scanner detects an anomaly, the passenger will be allowed a second pass through the machine to resolve the issue. If the matter is still unresolved, the TSA screeners will be able to use other methods, such as an explosive trace detection test, before subjecting the traveler to a physical pat down. Passengers may be required to remove shoes and may still undergo a pat-down if anomalies persist. TSA officers will make a visual assessment to determine which passengers are 75 or older, the agency said. The TSA said the new procedures will allow officers to better focus on passengers who may be more likely to pose a risk to transportation while expediting the screening process.","The procedures being tested make allowances for people age 75 and older .

"(EW.com) -- Lindsay Lohan's NBC-mediated mini-comeback continues! Following an interview with Matt Lauer on Today -- and in preparation for her hosting gig on this weekend's ""Saturday Night Live"" -- Lohan swung by Thursday's episode of ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon."" The genial Fallon asked Lohan just how, exactly, she landed the hosting gig. Lohan claimed that she'd been pestering ""SNL"" czar Lorne Michaels for a return trip to ""SNL"" for a long time. ""I kept asking him,"" she said. ""I wasn't giving up."" Michaels apparently ran into Lohan in Los Angeles, and offered her the job on the spot: ""You know Lorne, he's very straight to the point,"" said Lohan. ""He was like, 'What about March 3?' I'm like, 'I'm free!'"" The ever-excitable Fallon was kind to the eternally beleaguered starlet, focusing his questions mostly on ""SNL"" and on her just-announced role as Elizabeth Taylor in an upcoming Lifetime movie. ""What's the name of the movie?"" asked Fallon. ""Liz and Dick,"" said Lohan, who endearingly couldn't understand why the audience immediately erupted into laughter. (Oh, get your mind out of the gutter!) From there, Fallon lightly skipped over the last eight years of Lohan's career, guiding the conversation into an mutual reminiscence about the very first ""Debbie Downer"" sketch back in 2004. If there was one awkward note in the interview, it came when Lohan asked Fallon -- apparently out of the blue -- if he'd be interested in swinging by ""SNL"" this weekend. (Fallon seemed nonplussed, and Lohan admitted she didn't know exactly what his role would be.) The actress stuck around to play a round of Pictionary. The clues included ""Pole Vaulting,"" ""Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is,"" and ""Corndog."" (Oh, get your mind out of the gutter!) It was, in short, an undeniably pleasant interview that offered absolutely no indication whether this weekend's ""SNL"" will be a comeback event, a trainwreck, or a postmodern trainwreck comeback event.

"(CNN) -- Australia's Samantha Stosur produced one of the biggest shocks in U.S. Open final history, beating Serena Williams in straight sets at Flushing Meadows to secure her first Grand Slam success. Williams, bidding for her fourth U.S. Open crown, had gone into the match as a hot favorite despite a troubled year blighted by injury and serious illness. But Stosur never allowed the American, who was cheered on by a patriotic New York crowd on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, to settle -- claiming a spectacular  6-2 6-3 triumph in 73 minutes, as Williams lost her cool following a contentious umpiring decision. ""I had one of my best days and I'm very fortunate that I had it on this stage in New York,"" Stosur said after the match. ""Ever since I started playing, it was a dream of mine to be here one day, and now my dream has come true."" Stosur breaks Aussie drought . Stosur, whose run to the final included a marathon third-round victory over Nadia Petrova that lasted a tournament record three hours and 16 minutes, continued: ""Serena, you are a fantastic player, great champion and have done wonders for our sport. ""Thanks to everyone back home for supporting me. All my friends, family and everyone else, thanks so much for supporting me. I look forward to coming back home."" Although she was only seeded 28th, Williams came into the tournament bang in form after winning two warm-up events -- including victory over Stosur in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto. And the American was mightily impressive in dismantling world number one Caroline Wozniacki in the semifinals, while ninth seed Stosur struggled to beat unseeded German Angelique Kerber in three sets in the other semi. With emotions high among New Yorkers, on a poignant day for the city, a Williams win looked set to provide the United States with a fitting end to a difficult occasion. But Stosur, whose only previous Grand Slam final appearance came last year when she lost the French Open to Francesca Schiavone, did not read the script, dominating the opening set against the 13-time Grand Slam champion, who had reached this stage without dropping a set in the tournament. Stosur broke Williams to lead 2-1 and then won the last 12 point of the set in an impressive display of pace and power. Then came the talking point of the match. Williams had already saved one break point in the first game of the second set. However, on the second break point, the American shouted ""come on"" as she unleashed a fierce forehand before Stosur had reached the ball. Umpire Eva Asdaraki immediately penalized Williams for ""intentional hindrance,"" and the point and the game went to Stosur. Williams reacted angrily to the decision and was then given a code violation for verbal abuse. The American immediately broke back and then held serve but continued to berate the umpire at the changeover, as her composure ebbed away. ""Don't even look at me -- If I see you in the corridor don't even walk past me,"" shouted the 29-year-old. ""A code violation for expressing my opinion?, we're in America -- you're unattractive inside"" Stosur then broke serve to take a 4-3 lead and broke Williams again to clinch a famous victory -- becoming the first Australian women's winner at Flushing Meadows since Margaret Court in 1973. When asked about the incident after the match, Williams said: ""I was just doing my best. I hit a winner but I guess it didn't count. It wouldn't have mattered anyway because Sam played really well and she is a great player."" She continued: ""Six months ago I didn't think I would be standing here. I didn't think I would even be standing, let alone be here."" Stosur's victory means she joins Li Na and Petra Kvitova as first time Grand Slam winners this year.","Samantha Stosur is the new U.S. Open champion after beating Serena Williams .

"(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso claimed Ferrari's first Formula One victory of the season with a thrilling win in Sunday's British Grand Prix at Silverstone. The Spaniard took advantage of a poor pit stop by race leader and world champion Sebastian Vettel to go clear for the Italian manufacturer's first triumph since last year's Korean Grand Prix in October -- 11 races ago. Vettel held off Red Bull teammate Mark Webber to take second place, although team orders on the last lap meant Australian Webber was deprived of overtaking the German. Vettel takes the quiet road to glory . Lewis Hamilton was the best placed Briton in fourth, although the 2008 world champion was involved a wheel-to-wheel battle with the other Ferrari of Felipe Massa for that position, with the McLaren sending his rival wide on the final bend to secure that place. Heavy showers beforehand made for difficult conditions at the beginning of the race and a brilliant start by Vettel saw him overtake the pole position of Webber by the first corner. Vettel held onto that advantage until the 25th lap when problems in fitting the left-rear tire to his car allowed Alonso to snatch the lead in the pit lane, an advantage he held all the way to the finish line. ""I saw the problem in the pit stop with Sebastian and we were in the lead at that moment, but who knows what might have happened after that,"" Alonso told reporters. Passing judgement: Hamilton must stay aggressive . ""I knew it was a race to be calm, make no mistakes, to not be off the track, and with that I knew the car had enough for victory and it came."" It was 29-year-old Alonso's 27th career victory, putting him level with Jackie Stewart in fifth place in the all-time Formula One victory standings. And it proved a perfectly-timed win for Ferrari, who were celebrating the 60th anniversary of their maiden success in Formula One, also at Silverstone. Despite his defeat, Vettel -- who has finished first or second in every race so far this season -- has actually increased his advantage in the overall standings to an impressive 80 points, lying on 204. Webber is up to second place on 124 points, with Alonso now third on 112. The day's big loser was 2009 world champion Jenson Button, who lost second place in the standings after failing to finish, after a wheel nut to his front-right tire was not fixed on properly.","Fernando Alonso claims victory for Ferrari in Sunday's British Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Eurozone finance ministers sealed a deal Tuesday morning for a second bailout for Greece, including €130 billion ($173 billion) in new financing. The finance ministers from the 17 nations that use the euro, known as the Eurogroup, gave Greece the funding it needs to avoid a potential default next month. While this new deal provides some short-term relief for Greece, difficult days lie ahead as the government tries to trim debt to 121% of the country's gross domestic product by 2020. Greece's debt now stands at about 160% of GDP. The announcement came at an early morning press conference in Brussels after finance ministers met for more than 13 hours. ""In the past two years and again this night, I've learned that 'marathon' is indeed a Greek word,"" said Olli Rehn, vice president of the European Commission. ""But in the end we came to an agreement (that is) very far-reaching and important."" ""It's clear that the Greek economy cannot rely anymore on a large public administration financed by cheap debt, but rather needs to lean on investment both Greek and foreign,"" Rehn said. ""This should give Greece enough space to improve its competitiveness,"" added Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, saying that the goal of the terms of the new bailout is to create growth for the Greek economy. ""There are downside risks, that is clear."" Greece is in its fifth year of recession, and the government reported last week that Greece's GDP, the broadest measure of a nation's economic output, fell 6.8% last year. That's much worse than the 6% contraction the government originally predicted. Fourth-quarter GDP also continued to decline, shrinking 7%, compared with a 5% decrease in the third quarter. This new program will give ""financial stability in Greece and in the euro area as a whole,"" the Eurogroup said in a statement announcing the deal. ""The Eurogroup is fully aware of the significant efforts already made by the Greek citizens but also underlines that further major efforts by the Greek society are needed to return the economy to a sustainable growth path."" An austerity pact was approved by the Greek parliament on February 12, leading to some of the worst riots in the country in recent years. The package, which included deep cuts in government spending, wages and pensions, helped pave the way for eurozone finance ministers to sign off on Tuesday's new bailout deal. Tuesday's bailout deal ""certainly removes some near-term risk,"" said Frederick Neumann, senior economist for HSBC in Hong Kong. ""I think it's clear that questions will emerge whether Greece can stomach these cuts."" Greek voters are scheduled to head to the polls for parliamentary elections in April, a vote that will widely be viewed as a referendum on the tough austerity measures the nation faces. Greece has also hammered out a plan to write down €100 billion worth of Greek government bonds and swap existing debt for securities with lower interest rates, a deal that would result in losses of 53.5% of nominal value for the private sector. The euro raised a half percent against the dollar to 1.327 within minutes of the announcement, but otherwise market reaction was muted during Asia trading hours, suggesting investors have already priced in the bailout deal, analysts said. ""There are details to be worked out. Big work is done now, I think that will provide relief to financial markets,"" Neumann said. ""But it's difficult to see this turning around the Greek economy anytime soon."" While the Greek economy is small compared to other eurozone countries -- ""about the size of Connecticut compared to the rest of the United States,"" Neumann said -- the real threat is keeping the debt crisis and borrowing costs from spiraling to larger economies in the eurozone. A default by Greece could spark ""a Lehman-like event,"" he said, referring to the collapse of the investment bank that catalyzed the 2008 financial crisis. ""I think we understand these issues much better than we did three years ago,"" Neumann said. ""Kicking these issues down the road has been useful to some extent"" because a default would be less likely to take the markets by surprise, he added. ""The next hurdle is to create a firewall to put up sufficient money to know that Ireland and Portugal won't be next,"" Neumann said. ""This today is really short-term relief, but we'll probably be looking at these issues (at) some point."" There has been some speculation that Greece might exit the eurozone, but Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker stressed ahead of Monday's meeting that Greece should remain a member of the euro currency union. ""It is the intention of nobody to have Greece outside of the eurozone,"" he said. ""That would be a bad solution for Greece and ... a bad solution for the euro area."" The Greece deal is not the final step toward stabilizing eurozone debt woes. Pressure remains on both the IMF and the European Central Bank to provide more support measures, analysts said. ""From our perspective, clearly you need to have more firepower on the table,"" said economist Leif Eskesen at HSBC. ""Investors are waiting to see if the European Central Bank will make more direct steps in the sovereign bond market, buying up debt from countries considered vulnerable like Spain and Italy."" CNN's Ramy Inocencio, Pamela Boykoff and Emily Reuben and CNNMoney's Maureen Farrell and Ben Rooney contributed to this report.","Economist: ""It's difficult to see this turning around the Greek economy anytime soon""

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- The death toll from a tropical storm that pummeled the Philippines rose to at least 447 on Sunday, according to the national chairman of the Philippine Red Cross. The vast majority of the bodies were found in the cities of Iligan and Cagayan de Oro, according to military officials and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Five people were killed in a landslide, but all others died in flash flooding. The provinces of Compostela Valley and Zamboanga del Norte were also hit, added Benito Ramos, chairman of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. About 400 people remain missing after Tropical Storm Washi, which is called Sendong locally. More than 2,000 have been rescued, the country's military reported. Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said officials are investigating reports that an entire village was swept away. Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon will travel to the stricken region Monday to assess the damage, according to a statement from the organization. Authorities have also begun distributing food rations for some 10,000 families affected by the storm, while also handing out thousands of blankets and mosquito nets, the Red Cross reported Saturday. Flash flooding overnight Friday -- following 10 hours of rain -- fueled the devastation, compounded by overflowing rivers and tributaries. As much as 20 centimeters (8 inches) of rain fell within 24 hours in some areas. Ramos said despite government warning, some did not evacuate. An estimated 100,000 people are displaced, according to the Department of Social Welfare and Development. At least 20,000 people were staying in 10 evacuation centers in Cagayan de Oro, Social Welfare Secretary Dinky Soliman said Saturday. Some 20,000 soldiers embarked on search-and-rescue operations, the military said. Officials asked for volunteers to pack food to send to those displaced. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed her condolences on behalf of the U.S. government and said the United States ""stands ready to assist Philippine authorities as they respond to this tragedy.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Jamaica's Usain Bolt is officially the fastest man on the planet as he set a new 100 meters world record of 9.72 seconds at an international meeting in New York. Bolt served notice of his immense talent ahead of the Beijing Olympics by breaking the world 100m record. Bolt was trimming two hundredths of a second off the record previously held by fellow-Jamaican Asafa Powell and for good measure relegated world champion Tyson Gay to a distant second. The 21-year-old had served notice of his excellent form by running a world's second fastest time of 9.76 seconds in Jamaica last month and he quickly took control of Saturday night's Reebok Grand Prix showdown with Gay, who finished in 9.85 seconds, still a personal best. Bolt gave credit to a big contingent of Jamaicans who were in the crowd to watch his feat. ""Just coming here, knowing a lot of Jamaicans were here giving me their support, it meant a lot,"" Bolt told the Associated Press. ""I just wanted to give them what they wanted."" ""He ran a perfect race,"" Gay said. ""I've got to take my hat off to him."" ""An awesome athlete,"" said Shawn Crawford, who finished sixth and witnessed history from two lanes inside of Bolt. ""The time shows it."" The lanky 1.95 meter Bolt had produced his previous best performances before this year over 200 meters and finished second to Gay at this distance in last year's world championships. With doubts over his starting ability in the 100 meters, Bolt was even pondering a move up to 400 meters in favor of the 100. But the record changes all that and with Powell, who is recovering from a chest injury, and Gay he will be among the favorites for the 100 meters at the Beijing Olympics. He faces a showdown at the end of June with Powell at the Jamaican national championshps. Also at the Jamaican event will be Veronica Campbell-Brown, who won the women's 100m on Saturday in 10.91, the fastest time of 2008. The start of the night was delayed by an hour because of threatening weather  the area and the meeting was briefly hit by a storm which left the track shimmering with a moist sheen ahead of the race of the night. Bolt was assisted by a healthy tailwind of 1.7 meters per second, just under the limit at which a record can be set. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"New York (CNN) -- A paralegal who accused the New York police commissioner's son of raping her inside a Manhattan law firm said the incident left her pregnant and prompted her to get an abortion, according to a source familiar with the investigation. The woman, described as around 30 years old, told police earlier this week of the alleged October attack by Greg Kelly, a former Fox News White House correspondent and current co-anchor on WNYW's ""Good Day New York."" Kelly, 43, the son of New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, has since taken a leave of absence from his anchor chair. He has not been charged with a crime. According to the source, the woman told authorities that over the course of three days in early October, the pair exchanged phone numbers, mutually flirted, talked and exchanged text messages about getting together. When they finally met for drinks at a South Street Seaport area bar, the woman told police that they each used credit cards and took turns paying, consuming drinks until she became intoxicated, according to the source. She said she then invited Kelly to her office building where they had sex in her boss' office, according to the source. The woman, whom authorities are not identifying, described her condition to authorities as ""woozy"" and said she was not a willing participant, the source said. She said she later learned that she was pregnant, telling authorities that it couldn't have been from her boyfriend, who had had a vasectomy, the source said. The woman told authorities she continued to exchange what the source described as nonconfrontational messages with Kelly following the alleged assault. Later, a man presumed to be the woman's boyfriend sought out the elder Kelly at a public event, according to Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne. The man said to the commissioner, ""'Your son's ruining my girlfriend's life,'"" Browne said. ""Kelly asked, 'What do you mean by that?,'"" added Browne, noting that the man said, ""there were too many people around, and so the commissioner told the man to write him a letter."" It's not clear if the man had done so. Greg Kelly's attorney, Andrew Lankler, said the allegation of rape is false. ""Mr. Kelly strenuously denies any wrongdoing of any kind, and is cooperating fully with the district attorney's investigation,"" he said in a statement. ""We know the district attorney's investigation will prove Mr. Kelly's innocence."" He said his client is ""cooperating fully."" The scandal leaves Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. again confronted with a sex scandal that bears implications far beyond the courtroom. Vance was involved in the sexual assault case against former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn last year. A hotel maid accused Strauss-Kahn -- once considered a leading French presidential candidate -- of assault during an encounter in his room at New York's Sofitel. The charges were ultimately dropped. Vance's office has taken over the Kelly investigation to avoid possible conflicts of interest by would-be police investigators, said a source with knowledge of the probe. His office, which fended off criticism over its handling of the Strauss-Kahn case, has remained largely tight-lipped about how prosecutors are dealing with the Kelly investigation. Linda Fairstein, former head of the district attorney's sex crimes unit, said she's confident Vance's office is well-positioned to handle the Kelly case. ""He could have kicked it out of the county, but it's not a conflict for him,"" Fairstein said. ""It all comes down to what his investigators can do."" Some of those investigators, she said, are former police officers who are capable of pursuing the case. Two days before the Kelly allegations surfaced this week, the newsman interviewed Vance about the handling of the Strauss-Kahn scandal. Prosecutors ultimately dropped that investigation due to apparent gaps in evidence and credibility questions about Nafissatou Diallo, the hotel maid. ""Your office chose not to prosecute Dominique Strauss-Kahn for sexual assault, an alleged sexual assault,"" Kelly said to Vance on ""Good Day New York."" ""A lot of people were frustrated. They thought Nafissatou Diallo had a strong case that should have at least gone to trial. Why did your office decide not to prosecute DSK?"" Vance responded that he felt he could not prosecute ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" ""Our job as a prosecutor's office is not to put points on the board,"" Vance said during the interview. ""Our job as a prosecutor's office is to try to do right. To pursue every case to where it should end up appropriately."" The investigation is the latest high-profile case before Vance, who has often been seen as a reformer, following a series of sexual assault cases that has left his office open to criticism. In addition to the Strauss-Kahn case, Vance's office presided over an investigation of two New York police officers who were acquitted in May on charges of raping a 27-year-old woman whom they had helped home. A jury acquitted the men of felony rape and burglary but found them guilty of official misconduct, a misdemeanor. Vance is the son of Cyrus Vance Sr., who held various high-level Cabinet positions, including Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter.","Source: The woman told authorities she was intoxicated at the time of the alleged rape .

"(CNN) -- What's the most important position in football? Who's the guy who we need to watch most closely to determine which way the Super Bowl will swing? I've been asking that question of every sports fan who knows more about football than I do today, from 10-year-old dreamers to veterans of the field and couch. I keep getting the same answers: Quarterback. Wide Receiver. Kicker. Running Back. Nobody got the right answer. Nobody said center. (The opinion just expressed is solely the opinion of the writer and some very huge men who play center or were protected by centers). Just try, this one Super Bowl Sunday, to think of the game through the eyes of the center and see what happens. The walk on . This journey begins with a chance encounter I had the other week with a guy who owns a sports marketing firm, a guy named Peter Miller. I looked up at this giant of a man (for context -- I'm 5-foot-8 -- in cleats). I asked him, ""What's your sport?"" ""Football,"" he answered. He played center for the Ohio State Buckeyes a long time ago. Bob Greene: The president who saved football . Not a star player, he emphasized. No football scholarship. But a guy so determined to play center for the college of his choice that he paid full tuition and tried out for the team as a walk-on. He made it. One of the 100-plus players on the Buckeye's roster. And each season, he worked to become a center worthy of the Buckeye name. So I asked: What does a center do besides snap the ball and block the guy in front of him? That's when he led me on a journey that convinced me that the most exciting 30 seconds of the game is the 30 seconds between when the huddle breaks ups and the ball is snapped. The snap . ""Everyone talks about hitting the quarterback,"" says Miller. Quarterbacks get hit during the game. Seven, eight, nine times. And Miller doesn't dismiss the punishment that inflicts. Five tech tools for the Super Bowl . But a center, says Miller, a center gets hit every single play. If the offense is controlling the ball, that could mean 70 or more times a game that the center takes a hit. Every time. Same guy. 70 hits. So centers are tough. But are they smart? Center brain . The center brain has to process vast amounts of information instantly. Every play is very detailed. Very specific. More specific than I ever imagined. Often, right down to how many steps back the quarterback will take before he plants his foot and throws the ball. You know the expression in war -- that a battle plan changes the moment the first shot is fired. In football it often changes, repeatedly, before the first shot, before the ball is even snapped. Take a pass play. The center -- and his offensive line -- know the QB's planning to pass. The center knows all the details of the play. The Super Bowl's humble beginnings . He bends down, puts his hands on the leather and that's when he begins to read the defense. The defense, says Miller, is often trying to mess with your head -- confuse the offensive line and the QB. It's the center's job to read the defense and help rewrite the offense. The defense is mixing things up, trying to create confusion for the offensive linemen. The QB's got a big brain. We all know that. So, says Buckeye Miller, if the QB knows the defense he sees at the line of scrimmage is not the defense he thought he'd see, he realizes his team can't throw the ball now. So the center is audibling -- shouting out a new protection plan to his offensive linemen. I knew the QB shouted audibles -- changed plays on the fly. I didn't know the center had to do that, too. ""BLACK, BLACK,"" shouts the center, which tells the offensive line they're about to change the play. But you can't shout BLACK all day because at some point the defense -- even if they're not as bright as the center, which I would never say, because, as I mentioned, I'm 5-foot-8 -- early on realizes BLACK or BLUE or RED means the offensive line is on to the defense's tricks, so the offense needs to keep changing the colors that signal an audible so the defense is forced to keep guessing too. The QB shouts BLACK 26 -- which, for our purposes now, might mean we're not passing any more. It's a run. The center knows the count for the snap, a little extra detail he has to keep in his brain during all this processing. It's a noisy place to process information. A stadium full of fans are screaming. It's hard to hear. But the brawn has to use his brain. And all this is happening, Miller points out, ""just after you got your brains beat in and the snot knocked out of you"" on the previous play. Too much information . ""On top of it, the QB is getting information called in through a coach who's on the sidelines who's listening to other coaches with a bird's eye view of the field. But ""you can't get frustrated."" That's how it is for anyone who works in any company, including a football team. ""You can have eight coaches on the sideline, some high in the booth, others on the ground, they can all see things -- things that you may not see. But at the end of the day,"" says Miller, ""it's the player who has to see things."" Breathless . All this is happening, Miller notes, while the center and everyone else on the field is out of breath. Because they've been working out on the field -- real time. At the Super Bowl in particular, he says, you need to make sure that during the pregame hype (which is going on at this very moment) all the way through the coin flip and the national anthem -- that you, the player, the center, can calm yourself down. Have we mentioned the snap yet? No. The ball hasn't even been snapped yet. And you know what else the center has to have on his mind. As soon as the center jumps out of the huddle and gets to the line, he puts his hand on the ball. With the shotgun hike -- which we'll see a lot of today -- the center has to get it to the QB's waist level quickly. ""Not too high. Not too low. Not too left. Not too right."" Almost sounds like reading Dr. Seuss when you're about to collide with 300 pounds. The play is on . A lot more goes on in those 30 seconds between the break of the huddle and the snap of the ball. But there's just one more thing that the former Ohio State Buckeye center -- who says he had the privilege of playing in about five Buckeye games for a total of about 50 snaps -- wants to let us all know to look for when we watch the Super Bowl and remember when we return to work Monday morning. Football, says Miller, gave him ""a real controlled environment in which to learn that life's not always going to be fair. A controlled environment of stress and discipline. Things aren't going to always work out the way you think."" And so this big man, this Buckeye walk-on, who is now a father of four with his own business, wants us to know this about what happens when the play is over and the whistle blows. ""You finish the play, and see whether it succeeded or failed -- whether everyone did their job or didn't. Guess what,"" he asks as my young daughter asks when she's excited to teach me something she knows. ""You know how you get rewarded after all that, after the whistle blows and the play is over? You go back in the huddle. And you have to do it all over again."" The universe of the center. It's the universe we share. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Schulder.","Schulder: Most exciting time of football game is between the huddle and the snap .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, a federal advisory panel, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, recommended that university scientists who have submitted articles on how to modify a flu virus to two very prestigious journals delete critical information from them before publishing. The papers describe how to alter bird-flu virus to be more infectious and potentially nastier. Yes, this is same bird flu virus that, as it moved into pigs, was freaking us all out last year. If you had the detailed map of the viral changes needed, then either a terrorist or an amateur ""garage"" biologist operating without the right safeguards would have a very effective critter for killing you and me. If there is one thing that scientists hate, it is any policy that restricts research in any way. Scientists are taught that they need to be bold in asking questions and not let anything deter them from following their thinking wherever it leads, no matter how unpopular that might be. They are also taught the absolute necessity of making their claims public in reputable journals so that other scientists can subject them to the critical skepticism from which the truth ultimately emerges. Once in a long while, however, the price of the truth is simply too high to let scientists disclose their findings publicly. That is so when it comes to publishing detailed information about dangerous viruses and microbes. We don't have to hide the genetic map for a killer avian flu virus from all eyes. Access to some who have clearance to see it should be possible. If that is done, then the truth will still be known about whether those making claims of being able to engineer the virus can actually do so. To go further with potentially catastrophic data is to court trouble. There are those who will say that the only way to fight terror is to adhere to those values that have proven crucial to the advance of science over the decades. The more we know, the worse for the terrorists. Unfortunately, that is no longer the world we live in. The ethics of inquiry need to adapt. Handing the complete formula for making a nasty pandemic bug to any nut with access to the Internet or a subscription to a scientific journal makes no sense in a world that has seen the use of anthrax and sarin as weapons of terror. Freedom is key to good science. Freedom from terror is also key to good science. When they conflict, the latter is more important freedom than the former. Journals and those who write for them ought to do all they can to try and ensure that most important freedom. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arthur Caplan.","For first time, a federal panel has advised that science journals censor flu study facts .

"Washington (CNN) -- The federal government unveiled new proposed regulations Wednesday mandating ""bolder health warnings"" on cigarette advertisements and packages, according to a news release from the Department of Health and Human Services. The proposed requirements, characterized as the biggest change in tobacco health warnings in 25 years, include ""nine new larger and more noticeable textual warning statements and color graphic images depicting the negative health consequences of smoking,"" the release stated. The public will have an opportunity to weigh in on 36 proposed images through January 9. Assuming the plan moves forward as scheduled, Food and Drug Administration officials will select the nine statements and images to be used no later than June 22. Rules requiring the use of the new images and warnings on all cigarettes distributed for sale in the United States would take effect by October 22, 2012. ""Today, FDA takes a crucial step toward reducing the tremendous toll of illness and death caused by tobacco use by proposing to dramatically change how cigarette packages and advertising look in this country,"" FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said. ""When the rule takes effect, the health consequences of smoking will be obvious every time someone picks up a pack of cigarettes. ... This is a concrete example of how FDA's new responsibilities for tobacco product regulation can benefit the public's health."" Mathew L. Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the proposed changes ""the most significant change in U.S. cigarette warnings since they were first required in 1965."" Anti-tobacco advocate Richard Daynard praised the new warnings. ""It's about time,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""Canada has had similar labels for at least five years and they've been very effective in reducing consumption there. It's an absolutely costless way to get information to people in a way that they will actually pay attention to it."" The law professor at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, and president of the Public Health Advocacy Institute said current warning labels ""are unread, as as far as anyone can tell ... It's not going to be possible to ignore the new ones."" The change became possible last year, he said, when Congress gave the FDA the broad power to regulate tobacco products. Before that, ""everything that was done had to be done by a vote of Congress."" Stanton Glantz was more blunt about why it had taken so long to effect change in the United States. ""It's because the tobacco companies have a lot of muscles,"" the professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco told CNN in a telephone interview. ""And because they give loads and loads and loads of money to politicians."" Under the current labeling, the United States ""has the weakest warning labels in the world,"" Glantz said. Glantz, who also directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at UCSF, predicted that some tobacco companies ""almost certainly"" are going to sue claiming that publishing the warnings would prove too onerous. In a statement, Philip Morris USA said it supported several of the initiatives cited by HHS regarding tobacco issues. ""Philip Morris USA has actively participated in the FDA's rule-making and public comment processes and plans to do the same on this proposal,"" it said. But David Howard, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., said the legality of requiring larger, graphic warnings on cigarette packages was already the subject of a lawsuit filed by the maker of Camel and Pall Mall cigarettes. The suit alleges that the warnings violate the company's First Amendment rights of commercial, free speech, Howard told CNN in a telephone interview. ""Seizing half of our packaging, devaluing our trademarks, we're challenging that,"" he said. Though the suit was rejected last year in federal district court in Bowling Green, Kentucky, the company has appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which is expected to take up the matter next year, Howard said. Tobacco use, according to the federal government, causes 443,000 deaths in the United States each year and remains the leading cause of premature and preventable death nationwide. An estimated 30 percent of all cancer deaths are related to tobacco use, health officials say. In the United States, smokers number 46 million -- including 20.6 percent of adults and 19.5 percent of high school students, according to the federal government. CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this story.","NEW: R.J. Reynolds is challenging the requirement in court .

"(CNN) -- Canadian skier Nik Zoricic died of head injuries sustained from a crash while racing Saturday at a World Cup Ski Cross event in Grindelwald, Switzerland. The 29-year-old Toronto resident died as a result of ""severe neurotrauma,"" despite being hospitalized shortly after the crash, according to a statement from the International Ski Federation. Zoricic fell just before the finish in the competition's eighth round, slamming into the course's safety netting, the statement said. Video footage showed him going wide to the right in the final jump. ""Nik was a very talented young ski racer and a great athlete who was much loved by his teammates and fellow competitors,"" Alpine Canada president Max Gartner said. ""He will be greatly missed by all of us and the ski community as a whole."" Zoricic, who was born in Sarajevo, began as an alpine racer but later switched to ski cross, a type of timed racing that includes skiing over a variety of terrain which is thought to test both a skier's freestyle and alpine skills. He was sixth in the overall standings in 2011, according to the federation. U.S. racer Ted Ligety tweeted Saturday that ""skiing is a great sport that gives but it also takes."" ""Sad day to lose Nik Zoricic, you'll be missed bud,"" he wrote. Zoricic's grandmother, Sofia Drudar, told CNN's Canadian affiliate CBC, ""It is such a tragedy. The hardest part ... I'm old already and still here and he is so young (and) gone."" The incident prompted race organizers to cancel the entire event, including the World Cup Final scheduled for Sunday. Zoricic's death on Saturday comes in the wake of the death of another 29-year-old Canadian skier, who died following a brutal crash during a training run in Park City, Utah.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The recent discovery of a severed head, two hands and two feet in the Hollywood hills is near the home of actor Brad Pitt, and authorities have interviewed his bodyguard for possible leads, police said Thursday. ""It's standard procedure for us to have our detectives canvass the neighborhood,"" Los Angeles Police Cmdr. Andrew Smith said. The bodyguard saw nothing unusual, he said. In an unusual coincidence, Pitt starred in the film ""Seven,"" in which he plays a detective and a severed head is found a box. Meanwhile, the dog walker whose canine discovered the head in a park near the Hollywood sign said she at first thought the head was a movie prop. ""Our assumption was that there was always people filming up there, and it was a prop,"" Lauren Kornberg told HLN. ""We walked down the ravine and got closer and realized it was a freshly severed human head."" In what police described as their biggest search in recent memory, 120 investigators scoured a seven-acre parcel of a park looking for clues in the dismemberment, which authorities believe occurred elsewhere, Smith said. ""We don't believe the murder occurred up here in the hills,"" Smith told reporters. ""Right now, there is somebody who committed murder somewhere out there."" As of late Thursday morning, police hadn't discovered any more remains or significant clues, Smith said. At least 30 Los Angeles police officers, a dozen coroner's investigators, helicopters, all-terrain vehicles, a SWAT team trained in climbing skills and mounted officers were searching a section of Bronson Canyon, next to Griffith Park, Smith said. The coroner's cadaver dog, who Smith said became exhausted at times Wednesday, was back on the trail after sunrise Thursday, sniffing for more remains of the victim. But authorities still haven't located the torso. ""We're going to leave no stone unturned,"" Smith said. The head is that of a man between 40 and 60 years old, with salt-and-pepper-colored hair, Los Angeles County Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said. Investigators ""have every reason to believe"" the hands, feet and head belonged to the same person, Smith said. Fingerprints taken from the severed hands could help identify the man, police said. ""That's what we're hoping,"" Smith said. Investigators also will use dental records and DNA in trying to identify the victim, but they are hoping the fingerprints could more readily provide an identification. Authorities plan to conclude their three-day hillside search Thursday afternoon and reopen the park to the public Friday, Smith said. ""We ask people to be cautious. Hike with friends. Don't go off alone,"" the commander advised. Searchers using the coroner's cadaver dog located the two hands and two feet scattered across seven acres of brushy and steep terrain, police said. Authorities believe the human remains were placed in one spot and then were spread by wild animals, Smith said. ""With the wildlife we have here with the coyotes and whatnot, if a body part is left up there, it's not long before it's disturbed by the animals,"" he said. The body parts were hidden until the animals found them, Smith said. ""You could say it was a determined effort to hide them,"" Smith said of the body parts, declining to elaborate. ""There was no intent that these were something that the public would find."" Wednesday's search located first one hand, about 50 yards from where the head was found. Another hand and then two feet were found just before waning daylight forced an end to that day's search, police Officer Cleon Joseph said. The person who placed the severed appendages in the Hollywood hills had to go out of his way, walking to an off-the-beaten-path location to leave the limbs, Smith said. ""Had it not been for the dog walker, we may not have found"" the remains, Smith said. The real-life Hollywood mystery began Tuesday afternoon when two people noticed their dogs dragging a plastic grocery bag from a bush near a dirt trail, police said. The women were shocked when they realized a severed head was inside. In an interview with HLN, Kornberg, the dog walker, said she was walking eight dogs when one of them, a golden retriever named Ollie, ran away from her. Kornberg was joined by her mother, who was walking her own dog. ""We were wandering the trail and the dogs are sniffing around, and he (Ollie) pulled away from me and made a beeline for some brush. He was barking,"" Kornberg said. ""A few minutes later, he had something in his mouth, which he immediately dropped,"" Kornberg said. The object rolled down the ravine, Kornberg said. Kornberg and her mother discovered it was a human head belonging to what she described as a white man. ""We were pretty much gasping, saying, 'Oh, my God!' I was shaking. It felt like a script,"" Kornberg said. ""It still doesn't feel real."" The secluded trails, adjacent to Griffith Park, are a favorite place for residents, including many celebrities, to walk their dogs or hike. The coroner's office is examining whether the man was dead when the dismemberment occurred, and what kind of instrument may have been used to remove the head and limbs, Smith said. Police don't have a theory on what happened. ""Right now, we're keeping an open mind ... on why this poor person was dismembered and deposited up there,"" Smith said. Detectives estimated the man had been dead since Sunday. Police are also checking recent missing-person reports for leads, Winter said. CNN's Chuck Conder and Rosalina Nieves and HLN's Selin Darkalstanian contributed to this report.","NEW: Dog walker who found the head first thought it was a Hollywood prop .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio-born student missing for three weeks after being detained by Syrian authorities has been released, his family announced Wednesday. Syria's government released 21-year-old Obada Mzaik to his father Wednesday evening, said his uncle, Firas Nashef. Mzaik was taken into custody after flying from Detroit to Damascus on January 3, Nashef said. ""We're grateful that he's back with his family, and we're grateful to the community for showing support to the family during difficult days,"" Nashef said in a statement issued on behalf of the family. No further details were released. Mzaik is a dual American and Syrian citizen who was studying civil engineering at a private university in the Syrian capital, his uncle said. He was born in Columbus but moved with his family back to Syria when he was child. Mzaik had enrolled in a seasonal program at a Michigan community college and had planned to pursue a master's degree in the United States, Nashef said. He had just flown back to Damascus with his younger brother to visit family and prepare for the start of the new semester when he was held for questioning by security officers, said Nashef, a dentist in the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills. His brother was soon released, but Mzaik was held for further questioning -- his second arrest by security forces amid the months-long uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, according to his uncle. Nashef said his nephew had been arrested last summer and held for 37 days for ""spreading fliers about the revolution,"" and his family feared the worst after he was picked up again. The U.S. State Department said Tuesday that it was trying to confirm Mzaik's welfare and whereabouts. There was no immediate reaction to news of his release.","Obada Mzaik was arrested in Syria in early January .

"(CNN) -- An extra time goal from Brazilian midfielder Jadson ensured Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk won the last ever UEFA Cup final with a 2-1 victory over Bundesliga side Werder Bremen in Istanbul. Jadson celebrates his winning goal as Shakhtar Donetsk became the final team to lift the UEFA Cup. Jadson's strike from 15 yards out lacked pace, but Werder goalkeeper Tim Wiese failed to save the shot and it slipped through his grasp to trickle over the line. However, there was to be drama in the final minyte of extra time when Werder striker Claudio Pizarro thought he had taken the final into a penalty shoot-out, but the goal was ruled out after the on-loan Chelsea forward was adjudged to have tugged back defender Dmytro Chygrynskiy before nudging the ball home. The victory means Mircea Lucescu's side become the first team from Ukraine to lift a major European trophy and gives eastern Europe a third UEFA Cup in five years after recent successes for Russian sides CSKA Moscow and Zenit St Petersburg. Next season the competition is being rebranded and renamed to become the Europa League. Shakhtar were always the classier of the two sides and they should have gone ahead in the fifth minute when Luiz Adriano was allowed the time and space to turn on the edge of the box, but he fired just wide with the goal gaping. He was almost made to pay a minute later as Shakhtar failed to clear Sebastian Boenisch's long throw but Frank Baumann miscued his effort. However, Adriano made amends for his earlier miss in the 24th-minute when he seized on a through-ball that had wrong-footed the Bremen defence and lifting a superb chip over the onrushing Wiese. Moments after his goal, Luiz Adriano found himself on the corner of the box again but lashed the ball over the bar, and his compatriot Willian then broke purposefully into the box, only to produce a tame finish straight at Wiese. But just as Shakhtar were threatening to extend their advantage, Bremen hit back through their own Brazilian, Naldo. The defender stepped up to take a 34th-minute free-kick, striking it so hard that goalkeeper Andrei Pyatov could only help it on its way into the net. At the other end, Wiese looked more assured in denying Mariusz Lewandowski's powerful strike and the teams went in level at the end of an absorbing first half. Wiese was back in action soon after the restart, doing well to punch away Darijo Srna's free-kick from the right and Jadson's strike from the left. With the game petering out extra-time looked increasingly likely and once it got under way, it was almost inevitable that it would be an error that would finally settle the issue. Less predictable was that Wiese would be the culprit, horribly misjudging Jadson's soft shot from 12 yards and undoing all his good work through the night by letting it bobble past him into the net.","Shakhtar Donetsk beat Werder Bremen 2-1 to win UEFA Cup final in Istanbul .

"(CNN) -- The former Penn State assistant football coach currently awaiting trial on child sex assault charges can visit with some of his grandchildren, a judge ruled Monday. The decision by Judge John Cleland eases some conditions of Jerry Sandusky's house arrest, which had forbidden contact with his 11 grandchildren. Joe Amendola, Sandusky's attorney, said the former assistant coach and his family are happy about the ruling. ""Jerry, Dottie, and their entire family are very relieved by and pleased with the court's decision,"" Amendola said in a written statement. Sandusky will be allowed to visit with eight of his grandchildren under parental supervision, Cleland ruled. But another judge in a custody case involving the other three grandchildren should decide whether Sandusky can visit with them, Cleland ruled. The mother of those children has strongly objected to them having contact with Sandusky. State Attorney General Linda Kelly had blasted Sandusky's request to see his grandchildren, saying in a motion earlier this month that Sandusky was fortunate to be granted house arrest when ""he is alleged to have committed 52 sexual offenses."" Kelly also argued that Sandusky should be required to stay indoors during his house arrest because of fears among neighbors and teachers at a nearby elementary school. Cleland denied that request Monday, ruling that prosecutors did not present any evidence showing that Sandusky had tried to contact children at the school. The state ""failed to present any evidence whatsoever that (Sandusky) presents a clearly defined threat to any student at the adjoining elementary school simply by being on his deck,"" Monday's the ruling says. Cleland also ruled Monday that Sandusky would be allowed to have visits from adult friends and to leave his home for meetings with attorneys and private investigators aiding in his defense, provided that a probation coordinator approves. ""Jerry is also happy he can now have visitation with long-time friends with the prior approval of the Probation Department and will be able to continue to use the deck to his home to exercise, care for and supervise his dog, Bo, when Bo is in the yard,"" Amendola said in his statement issued after Monday's ruling. Sandusky has been under house arrest since December, when he was charged with sexually abusing young boys over a 15-year period. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Cleland has said he is aiming for a May 14 trial for Sandusky. On Monday, the judge denied a prosecution request that jurors be selected from outside the county where the former coach is being prosecuted. The allegations against Sandusky led to the firing of Penn State's heralded head football coach Joe Paterno only months before he died of complications from lung cancer. Tim Curley, Penn State's former athletic director, and Gary Schultz, a former university vice president who oversaw campus police, have been charged with perjury and failing to report an alleged 2002 sexual assault of a child. Both of them have pleaded not guilty. On Monday an attorney requested that the perjury charge against Curley be dropped, arguing that Paterno's death means prosecutors no longer have a required second witness to support the charge. CNN's Jason Carroll and Mark Norman contributed to this report.","NEW: Sandusky's attorney says the family is happy about the ruling .

"London (CNN) -- Two men who were found guilty of the racist murder of a black teenager in London were sentenced Wednesday to more than 14 years in prison each, the court said. Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted Tuesday in the killing of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, after a trial based on new forensic evidence. The judge said at the sentencing that the crime was committed for no reason other than racial hatred, British media reported. Dobson was sentenced to serve at least 15 years and two months in prison, while Norris got a minimum of 14 years and three months, the court said. Norris will be given credit for just over a year that he has already served on remand. Both technically were given indefinite sentences -- ordered to serve ""at Her Majesty's pleasure."" Dobson's father shouted ""Shame on you all,"" to the packed courtroom as the sentence was read out, British media reported. British law required Dobson and Norris to be sentenced as if they were minors because they were teens when they killed Lawrence. The conviction was the culmination of a case that has gripped the British media for almost two decades and resulted in a government inquiry in 1999 that was heavily critical of the police for their handling of the case. Changes brought about as a result of the Macpherson Report in 1999 -- which labeled the Metropolitan Police force ""institutionally racist"" and said its investigation of the murder was fundamentally flawed -- continue to impact how the police and legal system operate today. Speaking outside court, Lawrence's mother, Doreen Lawrence, expressed her gratitude to those who had supported the family through their long fight for justice. It was a ""difficult day,"" she said, but the judge had recognized the stress and suffering the family had gone through and handed down the longest sentences he could under the law. The judge also recognized the men for what they had done, she said, ""and there's no hiding behind their ages."" Dobson was 17 and Norris 16 at the time of the murder. Stephen Lawrence's father, Neville Lawrence, told reporters he hoped to be standing outside the court in a year's time marking the sentencing of the other men allegedly involved in his son's death. Other youths who were with Norris and Dobson on the night of the murder have long also been suspects in the case. However, extensive re-examination of material gathered at the time has not yet produced evidence for a prosecution. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe told the BBC Wednesday that ""the other people involved in the murder of Stephen Lawrence should not rest easily in their beds."" Deborah Glass, deputy chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission -- a body set up as a result of that government inquiry -- paid tribute to the efforts of the Lawrence family. ""There can be no doubt that in their struggle they were also instrumental in bringing much-needed fundamental reform to policing in this country,"" she said in a statement. ""It is important to acknowledge the changes that have been made over the past decade, but there is equally no doubt that much remains to be done to increase the confidence of black and minority ethnic communities in policing."" While the initial murder inquiry had been ""truly shocking in its negligence,"" she added, the current investigation team deserved credit for its work on the case. Speaking outside court Tuesday, Doreen Lawrence told reporters that she felt ""relief that these racist men no longer feel they can murder a black man and get away with it."" But, she said, the court's decision was not a cause for celebration. ""These verdicts will not bring my son back,"" she said. ""How can I celebrate when my son lies buried, when I can't see him or speak to him?"" She had harsh words for the police involved in the original investigation, saying they had put her family through huge pain and uncertainty through their failure to investigate properly. ""This result shows that the police can do their job properly -- but only if they want to,"" she said. ""I only hope that they have learned their lesson and don't put any other family through what we've been put through."" Lawrence, who was 18 when he was stabbed to death in southeast London in an unprovoked attack, was a good student who had applied to study architecture at university. Stephen was a son any mother would have been proud of, Doreen Lawrence said, and she missed him with a ""passion."" The Macpherson Report concluded that ""Stephen Lawrence's murder was simply and solely and unequivocally motivated by racism."" During the six-week trial, jurors were told of significant new forensic evidence recovered from clothing seized from the suspects' homes 18 years ago, including a very small blood stain on the collar of a jacket taken from Dobson's closet. DNA testing indicated the blood was that of Lawrence. Evidence was also found linking Norris to Lawrence's death. The new forensic evidence was the result of ""previously unavailable scientific technology and techniques,"" said Cressida Dick, acting deputy commissioner for the Metropolitan Police. The defense claimed that the incriminating evidence was the result of cross-contamination after the clothing was seized by police. Dobson had previously appeared in court in 1996 in connection with the Lawrence murder, but that case -- a private prosecution brought by the Lawrence family -- collapsed and he was acquitted. His latest trial on the same charge was allowed thanks to a change in the centuries-old ""double jeopardy"" law under which a person who had been acquitted could not be tried again for the same offense. In a change that came into effect in 2005 in England and Wales, a second trial is allowed if substantial new evidence emerges. The head of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, set up by the teenager's parents to help young people who want to study architecture, said Tuesday he welcomed the verdict ""with a sense of huge relief."" ""Throughout the 18-year ordeal, the Lawrence family's desire has been the pursuit of justice -- today, justice was served,"" chief executive Paul Anderson-Walsh said in a written statement.","NEW: Neville Lawrence says he hopes other suspects in the case are also brought to justice .

"(CNN)  -- Carlo Ancelotti was sacked as Chelsea manager Sunday night after their 1-0 defeat to Everton in the final match of the English Premier League season. Despite the defeat, Chelsea finished second in the standings to Manchester United, but they were beaten in the quarterfinals of the Champions League by arch-rivals United and failed to bring any silverware to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea won the English domestic double in Ancelotti's triumphant first season in charge, but after a strong start to this campaign a string of disappointing results saw them drift out of the title race. Statistically, it is their worst season since Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003, with Ancelotti paying the price. The club said in a statement on their official website: ""Chelsea Football Club can confirm that Carlo Ancelotti parted company with the club today (Sunday, 22 May). ""The owner and board would like to thank Carlo for his contribution and achievements since taking over as manager in July 2009, which included winning the Double for the first time in the club's history. ""However, this season's performances have fallen short of expectations and the club feels the time is right to make this change ahead of next season's preparations."" Ancelotti gave his post-match press conference after the defeat at Goodison Park, but was told by chief executive Ron Gourlay that his services were no longer required before he left the ground. ""Chelsea's long-term football objectives and ambitions remain unchanged and we will now be concentrating all our efforts on identifying a new manager,"" added the club statement. Guus Hiddink, who enjoyed a successful caretaker spell at Chelsea after Luiz Felipe Scolari was sacked, has been linked with a return and is a personal friend of Abramovich. But he is currently in charge of the Turkey national team and reportedly not keen on a return to club management. Other names being mentioned inevitably include Jose Mourinho, who led Chelsea to two titles, and 33-year-old Andre Villas-Boas, who is being dubbed as the new ""Special One"" after breaking several of Mourinho's records at Europa League winners Porto. Former AC Milan manager Ancelotti is the sixth manager of Abramovich's eight-year reign and came to the Blues with a top-class record having guided the Rossoneri to a pair of Champions League triumphs.","Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti sacked after final match of season .

Although Manuel Pellegrini continues to be coach of Real, speculation surrounding Mourinho's probable appointment intensified in the days leading up to the Champions League final -- and the former Chelsea manager finally revealed that all the speculation had been true.

"(CNN) -- British boxer Dereck Chisora threatened to shoot compatriot David Haye when the two became embroiled in an ugly brawl after Chisora had been defeated in Munich by WBC heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko. At a press conference after Ukrainian Klitschko had beaten his opponent on points, the British pair became embroiled in an angry exchange before Chisora left the stage to confront former WBA heavyweight champ Haye and a scuffle ensued. The sparring duo were eventually pulled apart with Chisora accusing Haye of striking him with a bottle before threatening to ""shoot"" and ""burn"" his rival. Can boxing climb out of the gutter? The UK Press Association reported Sunday that Chisora had been detained by German police as he prepared to return to Britain, and later released without charge. They are also keen to speak to Haye but his whereabouts remain unknown. Chisora slaps heavyweight champion Klitschko at weigh-in . The drama ensued when Klitschko, who was awarded the fight by a unanimous points decision, and Chisora faced the press shortly after their bout. Haye, who was comprehensively defeated by Vitali's brother Wladimir in July last year, also attended. Haye, who had been covering the fight for a UK television station, reacted angrily when Klitschko's manager Bernd Boente told reporters: ""With the bad experience we've had with British fighters we will now look for other countries. Contrary to David Haye, Dereck Chisora really went for it and really tried."" At this point Haye, who had been keen to come out of retirement to face Vitali, interjected to say: ""You don't want to fight David Haye, no?"" Boente replied: ""You had an offer, you didn't accept it, now you are out. You are out. You cannot talk yourself back into the fight, you have no belts. Chisora showed heart, contrary to you. ""You showed your toe (Haye claimed his poor performance against Wladimir was due to suffering a broken toe before the fight)."" Chisora then left the stage to confront Haye after the pair had traded insults at which point the scuffle ensued. Haye's manager Adam Booth tried to separate the two and suffered a cut to his head. After the boxers were pulled apart, Chisora accused Haye of hitting him with a bottle and was heard to say ""If David don't fight me, I am going to physically burn him."" He also said on four separate occasions that he would ""shoot"" Haye. Vitali, who took his record to 44 wins from 46 fights with victory, later told Sky News: ""If you are sportsman with millions of people watching you have to set a good example, and Chisora didn't do that."" His brother Wladimir added: ""I'm totally disappointed, it went a little too far, the sport of boxing shouldn't be like that. Bloody faces in the news conference... fighting in the ring, not out. I'm really surprised."" Chisora caused controversy on Friday when he slapped Vitali at the weigh-in ahead of the fight. Moments before the fight began, he also spat water in Vitali's face. The British boxer has a career record of 15 wins and three defeats from his 18 professional fights, and has a history of creating talking points. He planted a kiss on Derek Baker at the weigh-in before their fight in 2010 before knocking his opponent out in round two.","British boxers Dereck Chisora and David Haye brawl at a press conference .

"(EW.com) -- Last winter on the set of the show's massive post-Super Bowl episode, ""Glee"" co-creator Ryan Murphy told EW that he wanted the gay teenage relationship between Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Blaine (Darren Criss) to be just as complicated as any of the show's heterosexual romances. Now he's making good on his word: Tuesday's episode of the Fox hit, ""The First Time,"" finds not only Rachel (Lea Michele) and Finn (Cory Monteith) having sex with each other for the first time, but -- in a groundbreaking move for an 8 p.m. series -- McKinley High's gay couple doing the same. (Warning: SPOILERS ahead!) ""We were talking about it [in the writers' room] like, 'Why shouldn't [Kurt and Blaine] lose their virginity at the same time?'"" Murphy tells EW exclusively. ""Everybody has seen a straight couple losing their virginity, but has anyone dovetailed the gay and straight stories together and given them equal weight? That seemed like an exciting choice and a new thing."" According to Murphy, the four actors' only worry was that they look good in the love scenes: ""The first thing they all said was 'Do we have to go on diets?'"" Originally, when there was talk this past summer of a ""Glee"" spin-off, the thought was that Rachel would lose her virginity after moving to New York. Says Murphy, ""Some of the women in the [writer's] room thought it was crazy and thought we should really give that moment this year to Finn."" The ""Glee"" co-creator also reveals that network Fox expressed no concern over the episode's potentially polarizing subject matter -- though the Parents Television Council issued a statement Tuesday condemning the episode: ""The fact that 'Glee' intends to ... celebrate children having sex is reprehensible. The gender of the high school characters involved is irrelevant."" Murphy, who isn't surprised by the controversy, is staying focused on the bigger picture: In a year when bullying and teen suicides have grabbed headlines, he's hopeful that Kurt and Blaine's romance will continue to deliver a positive message to ""Glee's"" audience. ""I think what it says to a lot of young gay people who are confused and ashamed is that you can get love and are worthy of love."" ""Glee"": Get the latest news, photos, and more . Viewers also saw the return of Kurt's bully, Karofsky (Max Adler) in Tuesday's episode. Surprisingly, Murphy says he gets a lot of comments, particularly from gay men, asking for a Kurt/Karofsky romance. Says Murphy, ""We're going to write something about it. I do think the reason why he attacked Kurt so viciously is he he had all these feelings that he didn't know what to do with.

"(CNN) -- England winger Theo Walcott scored twice as Arsenal fight back from going two goals behind to sensationally thrash north London rivals Tottenham 5-2, a result that lifts Arsene Wenger's side back into fourth place in the Premier League table. Matches between the top sides in England this season have produced a host of remarkable results -- and it proved no different at The Emirates on Sunday on a glorious sunny afternoon. Third-placed Tottenham began the day 10 points ahead of their neighbors and still with designs of catching Manchester City and Manchester United at the top of the table. And they achieved the perfect start when Louis Saha's shot deflected in off defender Thomas Vermaelen to give Spurs a fourth minute lead. The visitors then doubled their advantage when former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor scored from the penalty spot after goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was adjudged to have brought down Gareth Bale. But Arsenal rallied and two goals in the last five minutes of the half brought them level. First defender Bacary Sagna nodded home Mikel Arteta's cross, then Premier League top scorer Robin van Persie curled home a superb effort -- his 23rd league goal of the season. Arsenal maintained their momentum after the break and Tomas Rosicky put them ahead in the 51st minute when flicking the ball home from close range. By now Arsenal were rampant, and Walcott made it 4-2 after 65 minutes after Van Persie superbly laid the ball into his path. With Tottenham demoralized, Walcott then added a fifth just three minutes later, outpacing the visiting defense before firing home. To complete a miserable afternooon for Harry Redknapp's side, midfielder Scott Parker was shown a second yellow card for a late challenge on Vermaelen as Tottenham finished the match with 10 men. The result leaves Tottenham seven points ahead of Arsenal, who go back above Chelsea on goal difference, although Spurs are now eight points behind second placed Manchester United -- who closed the gap on Manchester City to just two points after a late 2-1 victory at Norwich on Sunday. City continue to lead the table on 63 points, with United still breathing down their necks in second after veteran pair Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs proved the difference against a determined Norwich side. Scholes, who came out of retirement this season at the age of 37, opened the scoring in the seventh mimute with a close-range header at the back post. But Norwich looked to have rescued a point seven minutes from time when Grant Holt fired home after his turn out-witted Rio Ferdinand. But 38-year-old Giggs, playing in his 900th competitive match for United, celebrated that milestone with a stunning winner, volleying home Ashley Young's cross in the second minute of injury time. Meanwhile, at Wembley Stadium, Liverpool defeated Championship side Cardiff City 3-2 on penalties to win the English League Cup, manager Kenny Dalglish's first trophy since returning to the club. Joe Mason had given Welsh club Cardiff a shock half-time lead but Martin Skrtel thumped home from close range after the break. Substitute Dirk Kuyt looked to have given Liverpool victory in extra time, but a late Ben Turner goal sent the match into a dramatic penalty shoot-out. Steven Gerrard and Charlie Adam missed Liverpool's first two spot-kicks, but Cardiff conspired to miss three of their own -- two of them hitting the post. In an ironic twist, the final penalty miss was by Cardiff defender Anthony Gerrard, the cousin of the Liverpool captain.","Arsenal fight back from 2-0 behind to thrash north London rivals Tottenham 5-2 .

"(CNN) -- A dramatic fightback from Ryan Lochte secured a thrilling victory over Olympic champion Michael Phelps in the men's 200m freestyle at the World Championships in Shanghai. Lochte trailed fellow American Phelps at the halfway stage but battled back to win in a time of one minute, 44.44 seconds compared to his rival's 1:44.79. Defending champion Paul Biedermann, from Germany, claimed the bronze medal in a strong field. It was Lochte's eighth gold at the World Championships but his first at the 200m distance, and handed him a major boost with only a year to go until the 2012 Olympics in London. ""Michael and I have been battling head to head for about eight years,"" Lochte told FINA's official web site after his victory. ""We definitely build a good rivalry; he's a great competitor and I am just privileged to swim on the same team, even in the same event as him. ""Today, at this level we're at, we both want to win, we don't like to lose and no matter what the outcome is, we're still going to be friends and we're definitely going to be pushing each other for 2012."" Phelps emphasized the quality of the competition and said he is starting to recapture the form that has seen him bag 16 Olympic gold medals to date. ""That was probably one of the best 200 freestyle fields and that was a close field; five guys in the 1.45, that's pretty good,"" he told FINA's web site. ""I would have wanted to win but this is something that is going to help me a lot for the next year."" He also said a lack of training has contributed to a dip in his performances. ""The reason why I haven't been able to swim as fast as I wanted to in the last couple of years, it's all my fault. ""If I would have trained like I was supposed to for as long as I am supposed to, on a consistent level, I would be swimming where I want to swim. But now, I am sort of coming back to my old self."" There was an even closer finish in the men's 100m backstroke, when French pair Camille Lacourt and Jeremy Stravius shared the gold medal after both recorded a time of 52.76. It is the first time ever two swimmers from the same country have tied in a dead heat for first place. It was also France's first ever male title in the championships. Elsewhere, China's Zhao Jing won a gripping women's 100m backstroke final, beating Russia's Anastasia Zueva by just one one-hundredth of a second. American Natalie Coughlin took the bronze medal. Rebecca Soni, from the United States, successfully defended her women's 100m breaststroke title, beating Australian Olympic champion Leisel Jones and China's Ji Liping who took silver and bronze. A dominant performance from Denmark's Lotte Friis secured the women's 1,500 freestyle final. American Kate Ziegler took silver and China's Xuanxu Li the bronze.","Ryan Lochte beats Michael Phelps to claim men's 200m freestyle title .

"GLASGOW, Scotland -- Scottish footballer Phil O'Donnell died after collapsing during his team Motherwell's match against Dundee United on Saturday. Phil O'Donnell pictured during his spell with English club Sheffield Wednesday. The 35-year-old club captain was taken off the pitch at Fir Park on a stretcher in the closing stages of the Scottish Premier League match, which his side won 5-3. Motherwell's next two  matches, against Hibernian on Wednesday, and Celtic at the weekend, have been postponed. ""The players, the supporters, every one inside the executive are devastated and absolutely dumbfounded by the event of Phil's death,"" manager Mark McGhee said on Sunday. ""We had a meeting this morning with the players and obviously they have taken it very, very badly and we are going to have to help them through that."" O'Donnell, who started his career at Motherwell before stints with Celtic and Sheffield Wednesday, was about to be substituted at Fir Park against Dundee United but collapsed before he could leave the field. He was set to be replaced by substitute Marc Fitzpatrick, but fell to the pitch as the change was taking place. After been treated for about five minutes on the field, O'Donnell was carried off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. Medical staff from both clubs said that they thought he suffered a seizure, and efforts were made to revive him en route to hospital. However, he did not regain consciousness and was pronounced dead at 1718 GMT (1218 EST). O'Donnell's nephew, David Clarkson, who scored twice in the match, was also taken off after being alarmed by the incident. Club chairman Bill Dickie said: ""Unfortunately I can confirm very, very sad news that Phil O'Donnell has lost his life. We don't know what it was but there will be a post-mortem. ""This is a tragic happening and that's all I can say."" Motherwell owner John Boyle said: ""Everyone here is shocked to the core, and we are sure that everyone involved in Scottish football will feel the same. ""Phil was not only an inspirational player for Motherwell and club captain, but was an inspirational person. All of us at Motherwell are thinking of his wife Eileen and their four children."" McGhee added: ""I don't want to say anything more than how devastated everyone at the club is for his wife and his young children. Obviously from the club's point of view, we'll gather round to give his family as much support as they need."" O'Donnell, who won one Scotland international cap, began his career with Motherwell and rejoined the club in 2004 following spells with Celtic -- who he joined in a $3.5 million transfer in 1994 -- and English side Sheffield Wednesday. Scottish Football Association chief executive Gordon Smith said: ""This is absolutely devastating news. Phil was not just a wonderful footballer, he was a great human being. My thoughts are with his family at this tragic time."" Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell added: ""When the news came through, everyone at the club was obviously shocked. ""Our thoughts are with his family to whom we offer extreme condolences for a tragic loss of a young life. Everyone at Celtic Park will mourn him."" O'Donnell is the second Motherwell player to pass away unexpectedly in the past 20 years. Club legend winger Davie Cooper died at the age of 39 in 1995 after suffering a brain haemorrhage when filming a training video. Cooper had been a Motherwell team-mate of O'Donnell, who made his debut as a 17-year-old. He went on to score, as a 19-year-old, in the 4-3 victory over Dundee United in the 1991 Scottish Cup final, and won his sole Scotland cap in 1993 as a substitute in the World Cup qualifier against Switzerland. Former Scotland manager Craig Brown gave O'Donnell his only international outing, and had coached him in the Under-21 side. ""But for injury, I'm sure he would have had many, many more caps,"" Brown said. ""It's very, very sad news, I just can't get over it. You would not get a more ideal role model for a young footballer than Phil O'Donnell. ""I think in his first spell at Motherwell he was probably the best box-to-box midfield player -- maybe not just in Scotland but in the UK."" Injuries affected O'Donnell's spells with Celtic and Sheffield Wednesday and he returned to Motherwell after being released by Wednesday in early 2004. He played in the 2005 Scottish League Cup final, and was appointed captain in 2006 after former skipper Scott Leitch left the club. Football has suffered several other deaths in recent years. Cameroon midfielder Marc-Vivien Foe collapsed and died at the 2003 Confederations Cup in France, prompting world ruling body FIFA to demand stricter physical testing on players. Sevilla midfielder Antonio Puerta died in August after he collapsed on the field during a Spanish league game due to heart problems. Striker Chaswe Nsofwa died of heart failure while training in Israel, and 16-year-old English player Anton Reid died after collapsing while training with his club Walsall.

"(CNN) -- Veteran coach Claudio Ranieri has been given the chance to restore Inter Milan's fortunes following the short, unsuccessful tenure of Gian Piero Gasperini at the Italian club. Ranieri has previously been in charge of big European teams such as Juventus, Chelsea, Valencia, Atletico Madrid and Napoli, but has been out of work since leaving Inter's Serie A rivals Roma in February after a run of poor results. He takes over a team in turmoil, with Gasperini sacked on Wednesday following a 3-1 defeat by newly-promoted Novara -- Inter's second in three league matches. Gasperini, 53, is the only coach in Inter's history to leave without winning a game. The three-time European champions also lost to archrivals AC Milan in the Italian Super Cup and to Turkish outfit Trabzonspor in the Champions League group stage opener. ""Claudio Ranieri has officially become the new coach of Inter. He has signed a contract binding him to the club June 30, 2013,"" Inter's official website reported on Thursday. ""Everyone at F.C. Internazionale has the pleasure of welcoming Claudio Ranieri and his staff and wishing them well."" Ranieri, whose only major managerial honors are the 1996 Italian Cup with Fiorentina and 1999 Spanish Cup at Valencia, said he wants to improve the current squad's mentality. ""I think I will need to talk a lot with the squad, the mental aspect is very important,"" the 59-year-old told Italian television channel RAI Sport. ""Inter are a great team. We have to pick up the pace after this false start. The players are there and we have everything to lift the team. Gasperini had every right to try to execute his ideas; he tried to make his system work with all his strength, but without success. ""I do not think he can be criticized, he tried to implement his ideas until the end. For me, every system can bring victories -- if Inter have always played in a specific way, there must be a reason."" Known as the ""The Tinkerman"" from his time at Chelsea when he constantly rotated his team, Ranieri refused to make any promises of success this season as Inter seek a 19th Serie A crown. ""I do not like to promise things. I want the best from these players, who have so much to give."" His appointment means that Inter have now had four different coaches since current Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho left the San Siro in May 2010. Mourinho guided Inter to a historic treble, which included a first European Cup in 35 years, before being replaced by the Spaniard Rafael Benitez after leaving for the Bernabeu stadium. Benitez, who led Liverpool to Champions League success in 2005, was sacked in December 2010 despite taking Inter to victory at the FIFA Club World Cup. Former AC Milan coach Leonardo took over from Benitez and guided Inter to a second-place finish in Serie A last season, before his move to France's Paris St. Germain as director of football led to ex-Genoa boss Gasperini being appointed in June. Ranieri's first match in charge of his new team will be Saturday's league trip to Bologna. Meanwhile, the one Serie A match played on Thursday saw Roma and Siena draw 1-1 at the Olympic Stadium. Daniel Osvaldo put Roma ahead in the 25th minute when he tapped home Marco Borriello's pull back . But the visitors levelled with just two minutes remaining when Roberto Vitiello netted from a rebound after Franco Brienza's effort crashed against the post. The result means both sides are still waiting for their first victory of the season, having drawn two of their opening three games. In Spain, an injury time goal from Walter Pandiani gave Espanyol a 1-0 success over Getafe, who have now lost threee successive Primera Liga matches.","Inter Milan have appointed Claudio Ranieri as their new coach .

"(CNN) -- The new head of al Qaeda describes Syria's president as ""the leader of criminal gangs, the protector of traitors,"" and applauds anti-government protesters seeking to topple him, in a video that appeared on extremist websites this week. But one prominent Syrian activist, Loay Hussein, rejected the praise of the terror network's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, telling CNN ""we will not permit him or his organization to toy with our revolution and our movement."" ""Syria is not a playground for jihad,"" said Hussein, who said he wouldn't be surprised if the regime exploited the message to escalate its crackdown against anti-government protesters. Al-Zawahiri's message is believed to be his first since he was named leader of the terror network, following the death of former leader Osama bin Laden in a U.S. raid in Pakistan in May. CNN could not independently verify its authenticity. In the video, the bespectacled 60-year-old, dressed in a white robe, gestures and points with his finger as he speaks. He uses the seven-minute video, which first appeared Wednesday, to discuss Syria and address the protesters seeking to oust President Bashar Al-Assad. The protests have sparked a bloody government crackdown in various cities, according to witnesses. ""Oh free people of Syria and its mujahedeen,"" the al Qaeda leader said. ""It is better for you not to ally yourself with the colonialist powers of the world and the new crusades."" Al-Zawahiri said the United States changed its stance on Syria after similar uprisings led to the ousting of the longtime leaders of Tunisia and Egypt. ""America, which had committed itself to Bashar for the length of his rule, announces today that it stands with you,"" Al-Zawahiri said. ""After what it saw and the ground shook from the thunder of your rage and after it was devastated by the loss of its two biggest agents in Egypt and Tunisia."" The terror leader accuses the United States of planning to replace al-Assad with someone who protects Israeli interests. ""Today Washington seeks to put in the place of Assad who loyally protected the Zionist borders, another regime against your revolution and jihad with a government that follows America and cares for the interest of Israel."" Al-Zawahiri, the longtime deputy to bin Laden, took over leadership of al Qaeda in June. In the video, he does not make a reference to his new leadership role or the death of bin Laden. The video was produced by As-Sahab, al Qaeda's media arm, and the graphic at the beginning of the piece states it was shot in the Islamic calendar Rajab 1432 which is between June 3 and July 1. CNN cannot independently verify the accuracy of this date. The new leader was indicted for his alleged role in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya that killed 224 civilians and wounded more than 5,000 others. The FBI has a $25 million reward for information leading to his capture, the same amount it had for bin Laden. Loay Hussein, a prominent rights leader and member of the opposition inside Syria, was a political prisoner from 1984 to 1991. He said al-Zawahiri and other militants ""want a foot in Syria because it is a strategic country that can serve many of their interests."" ""Al Qaeda is already in Yemen, but in Syria, al Qaeda has no stronghold so it would like to gain one,"" he said. ""Al Zawhiri is trying to enter the picture and pretends he has credibility with ranks of demonstrators on the streets of Syria. This will be a failed attempt because the youth of Syria's revolution have no interest in the jihadists of al Qaeda."" Protesters have been demonstrating across Syria after Friday Muslim prayers, but Hussein said Zawahiri is kidding himself if he thinks al Qaeda's ""jihadist Islam"" is backed by people just because they march after leaving mosques. ""In Syria there is a forgiving Islam that does not accept killing or violence. None of the chants in the streets refer to a religious goal, all our aspirations are nationalistic,"" Hussein said. Hussein does think that the Syrian government may use the statement ""as an excuse to ramp up its crackdown on the protesters."" ""I would not be surprised if in a few days Syrian State TV begins to claim that jihadist members of al Qaeda are responsible for killing civilians to send even more security to raid our homes and villages.""

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- World powers meeting Friday in Tunisia called for a political solution in Syria and what one diplomat called a ""tsunami wave"" of pressure to peel away internal support for the embattled regime of Bashar al-Assad. ""We agreed on increasing the pressure on Assad, getting humanitarian aid in as quickly as possible and preparing for a democratic transition,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters. ""That was my message, and that was the message of the chairman statement that reflected the consensus reached here."" That consensus was reached during a day of meetings by the ""Friends of Syria"" in the cradle of the Arab Spring, where participants laid out the groundwork for a political transition in Syria, not unlike the international planning that preceded the changes in Libya, where Moammar Gadhafi's regime was toppled last year. Representatives of dozens of countries and entities developed a plan to deliver immediate humanitarian aid, to give political legitimacy to the Syrian opposition and to endorse the idea of a joint Arab-U.N. peacekeeping force. As the conference unfolded, Red Crescent volunteer rescue crews evacuated seven wounded people in the besieged Syrian city of Homs to Al Amin Hospital on the outskirts of the city's Baba Amr neighborhood, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Twenty unhurt Syrians were also taken to safety, she said. The evacuation of victims marks a glimmer of hope for residents who'd been pinned down under shelling and sniper fire for weeks. ICRC spokeswoman Carla Haddad Mardini told CNN that the organization planned to ask Syrian authorities for a pause in the fighting every day. ""We would prefer to have a two-hour humanitarian pause daily, where we would enter the different affected areas, including Homs, and deliver much-needed humanitarian aid,"" she said in a telephone interview from Geneva. Asked whether international journalists wounded in the city would be taken out, Mardini said the mission was ""to evacuate all wounded and sick in urgent need of medical assistance without any exception."" The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), citing an official source at the Foreign Ministry, said Red Crescent vehicles were dispatched Friday, ""for humanitarian considerations, to retrieve the foreign journalists who entered Syria illegally. The source added that the armed groups in Baba Amr declined to hand over an injured journalist and the bodies of two others, which jeopardizes the life of the injured journalist and thwarts efforts to return the two bodies to their countries."" Activists acknowledged that they had declined to turn over the journalists' bodies or the wounded journalists unless civilians also were taken to safety. They said the wounded journalists agreed with that decision. In addition, they said, Friday's ambulance runs were carried out as shelling continued in the area. The meeting in Tunis took place as Syrian security forces continued a nearly year-long crackdown on civilian protesters. European foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Friday that the ""humanitarian situation and lack of access for food and medical supplies is our most urgent and immediate concern."" At least 103 people were killed Friday. The dead include 18 corpses found in the Hama province town of Khatab and 30 people in Homs, the epicenter of resistance that has endured 21 days of daily shelling, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition groups. SANA said terrorists shot and killed a law enforcement member and wounded two others Friday in Homs. It also said that dozens of members of ""armed terrorist groups"" in the city had surrendered and given their weapons to authorities. Regarding events in Tunis, Syrian state television was dismissive. ""It is quite ironic that in a conference called 'The Friends of Syria,' we haven't seen one Syrian delivering a speech,"" said an anchor, who added that the conference was dominated by ""icons from the colonial era who are conspiring against Syria and the Arab world."" A guest implied that some of the countries in attendance had been paid, bribed or ordered to show up against their will. At the conference, Clinton said the end of al-Assad's regime ""can mark a new beginning."" She urged a negotiated political solution and a democratic transition for Syria, and announced that the United States is providing $10 million for humanitarian efforts. Clinton also said the ""crimes against humanity must stop."" In a statement, the Syrian National Council said it was seeking international recognition ""as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people."" The group formed last October as a coalition of local coordinating committees, political, ethnic and religious groups. It asked for humanitarian assistance and the creation of safe havens inside Syria to protect refugees seeking sanctuary. ""The clear goal of the SNC and one for which tens of thousands of Syrians have died or suffered is to achieve full regime change through a process controlled by the Syrians themselves,"" the statement said. Clinton gave the group qualified support, calling it ""a leading, legitimate representative of Syrians seeking peaceful democratic change."" She continued to hold out hope for a political solution. ""Assad can still make the choice to end the violence, save lives and spare his country from descending further into ruin but, if he continues to reject that choice, we and the Syrian people will keep pressure on him until his deadly regime cracks and collapses, because it will,"" she said. And she appealed to Assad's security forces to end the killing. ""Their continuing to kill their brothers and sisters is a stain on their honor,"" she said. ""Their refusal to continue this slaughter will make them heroes in the eyes of not only Syrians, but people of conscience everywhere. They can help the guns fall silent. We know from many sources there are people around Assad who are beginning to hedge their bets. They didn't sign up to slaughter people, and they are looking for ways out."" She made no reference to helping the militias fighting the al-Assad regime. But Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said that arming the Syrian opposition is an ""excellent idea."" U.S. officials have said they are not ready to take that step but they have not ruled out other options. Clinton said she would address the issue later. In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he was ""encouraged by the international unity"" displayed in Tunis. ""We are going to continue to keep the pressure up and look for every tool available to prevent the slaughter of innocents in Syria,"" he said. Neither Russia, which is a Soviet-era ally and arms dealer to Syria, nor China is participating in the Tunisia meeting. Both countries vetoed the U.N. resolution. The nations participating in the meeting unveiled a plan for delivering emergency aid. It called on al-Assad to ""immediately cease all violence"" and allow unimpeded access for aid, an effort that would be spearheaded by the United Nations. The United Nations is expected to play a major role in a post-Assad Syria. Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was named Thursday joint special envoy of the United Nations and Arab League on the Syrian crisis. The Friends of Syria group stressed that an alternative to al-Assad exists and it believes it can persuade traditional regime supporters, such as business elites, the military and minority Alawites -- who prevail in the military -- to switch allegiances. ""To those Syrians who still support Assad, especially members of the Syrian military: understand that this regime has no future,"" Clinton said. ""The longer you carry out its campaign of violence, the more it will stain your honor. But if you refuse to take part in attacks on your fellow citizens, your countrymen will hail you as heroes."" A senior State Department official said members of the council told Clinton they were pleased with the conference turnout and the initiative. ""The Syrian people have not surrendered, nor will they give up,"" SNC leader Burhan Ghalioun said. "" A free people was born in Syria and it does not fear death, nor does it accept any bargain to give away its long-deprived rights or give up its sovereignty by any definition."" The Friends of Syria intends to address economic issues by creating a working group on economic recovery and development, a diplomat said. The diplomat said the conference communique will endorse the Arab League's request to the Security Council to form a joint Arab-U.N. peacekeeping force after the cessation of violence.

"(CNN) -- Young French sprinter Christophe Lemaitre confirmed his growing reputation as a track star with a confident 100-meters victory at the European Athletics Championships in Barcelona on Wednesday night. The 20-year-old, the first white man to break 10 seconds at the distance, timed his run to perfection as his main rival Dwain Chambers of Britain missed out on a medal in a tight finish. Lemaitre came home in a winning time of 10.11 seconds to take the gold, with Chambers' teammate Mark Lewis-Francis handed silver in a four-man photo finish from Martial Mbandjock, another Frenchman. Lewis-Francis, Mbandjock, Chambers and defending champion Francis Obikwelu all clocked 10.18. ""I gave it everything I had, it was a very good race,"" Lemaitre, who was fastest in the earlier semifinals in 10.06, told reporters. ""I was worried at the start, but after that I ran the kind of race I normally run. I knew I had a chance of a medal, even winning gold."" Chambers, the current world indoor 60m champion who won relay gold in Stockholm four years ago on return after his ban for drug use, put on a brave face after his disappointing finish. ""I had to rely on my experience, which kept me relaxed, but it wasn't enough to win. I've just got to keep on ploughing at it until my opportunity prevails,"" said the 32-year-old, who won silver in 1998 and then had to return his gold in 2002 after being caught using steroids. Lemaitre's heat featured another strong performance from Irish Paralympian Jason Smyth, who is the first legally blind athlete to compete at the European Championships. The partially-sighted 23-year-old finished fourth in the eight-man heat in a time of 10.46, but even his personal best of 10.32 would not have been enough to reach the final. Turkish runner Elvan Abeylegesse of Turkey won the women's 10,000m title, finishing 12 seconds ahead of Russia's defending champion Inga Abitova, with Jessica Augusto of Portugal taking bronze. Abeylegesse won silver medals in the distance at the 2008 Olympics and 2009 world championships. Russia had a clean sweep of the medals in the women's 20-kilometer walk, as Olympic and world champion Olga Kaniskina went one better than her silver in 2006. Anisya Kirdyapkina, 21, took the silver while Vera Sokolova claimed bronze as the Russians followed up the victory of teenage compatriot Stanislav Emelyanov in the men's race on Tuesday. Latvia's Ineta Radevica claimed a shock gold in the women's long jump, with the 29-year-old heading off Portugal's 2006 silver medallist Naide Gomes in a tie-breaker after both leaped 6.92 meters. Olga Kucherenko was third in 6.84 while her fellow Russian and defending champion Lyudmila Kolchanova was back in fifth on 6.55. Former Olympic heptathlon champion Carolina Kluft was 11th of the 12 finalists on 6.33. Slovakia's top-ranked Libor Charfreitag won the men's hammer final with a best throw of 80.02 meters, while Italy's Nicola Vizzoni claimed silver with 79.12 and bronze went to Hungary's Krisztian Pars (79.06). Croatia's 20-year-old rising star Sandra Perkovic won the women's discus title with a best throw of 64.67, while Romania's 2006 bronze medallist Nicoleta Grasu was second with 63.48 and Poland's Joanna Wisniewska took third with 62.37. Germany's Nadine Muller, who has thrown the furthest this year with 67.78 in May, finished back in eighth on a disappointing 57.78.","Christophe Lemaitre claims gold medal in 100m at European Championships .

"Bucharest, Romania (CNN) -- Former Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase was placed on three years of probation Friday in a corruption case that had been under investigation for more than six years. Romania's Supreme Court found Nastase guilty of committing blackmail while he was prime minister, from 2000 to 2004. He also had been accused of bribery, but the court found him innocent on that charge. Nastase had denied all the charges in the case and said the trial was a political one, ordered by Romania's current president, Traian Basescu, who defeated Nastase when the two ran for president in 2004. Nastase's lawyer, Ion Cazacu, said he might appeal the decision. Nastase's wife also was placed on three years of probation for using false documents. She was found innocent on other charges, including bribery. The trial of Nastase and his wife started in 2010 after Romania's Anti-corruption Agency accused them of bribery and blackmail. Another main figure in the case was Irina Jianu, former head of a state construction agency, who was found innocent on charges of money laundry and bribery. However, the court found her guilty of using false documents, and she was sentenced to three years in prison. During the trial, the Anti-corruption Agency stated that Nastase received directly or through his wife â‚¬630,000 ($840,000) from Jianu while he was a prime minister. In return, the agency said, Nastase named Jianu as head of the construction agency. According to the prosecutors, the money was used by Nastase to buy objects and goods from China and to cover the cost of some work done at two of his houses, in Bucharest and Cornu. The Supreme Court found Nastase and his wife innocent regarding these accusations. The anti-corruption agency also said Nastase sent almost â‚¬90,000 ($120,000) to Ioan Paun, who was then a Romanian consul-general in China. The agency said the money was meant to be used in China for the purchase of various goods and objects for the Nastase family. This was the second conviction for Nastase this year. In January, he was sentenced to two years of prison in what was known as the Quality Trophy corruption case. He has appealed that decision. In that case, the Romanian Supreme Court found Nastase guilty of illegally raising â‚¬1.6 million ($2.1 million) during his 2004 campaign for president as the candidate of the Social Democrat Party. Nastase was also involved in another case, known as the Aunt Tamara case, in which he was accused of paying a $400,000 bribe to the former head of the country's anti-money-laundering agency to delete some documents related to his wife's bank account. Nastase was found innocent in that case. Nastase was the first former prime minister and the highest official to get a jail sentence in Romania since the fall of communism. The European Union has repeatedly called on Romania to put more effort into tackling corruption by top-level officials and politicians.","Former Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase is found guilty of blackmail .

"(EW.com) -- We're counting on Gaston Wahlberg to lead the way! In a weekend that saw both the Mark Wahlberg thriller ""Contraband"" and Disney's 3-D re-release of ""Beauty and the Beast"" perform better than expected, it was the former that crossed the finish line in first place. The R-rated ""Contraband,"" which stars Wahlberg as a former smuggler trying to protect his brother-in-law from a drug lord, earned an estimated $24.1 million over the standard three-day weekend, and looks to finish the four-day holiday weekend with about $28 million. That's a solid start for the $25 million movie, a remake of the 2008 Icelandic thriller ""Reykjavík-Rotterdam."" It also represents Wahlberg's strongest solo debut since 2008′s ""The Happening."" (What? No!) ""Contraband"" confirmed Wahlberg's ability to open a movie, as 69 percent of CinemaScore's participants listed the actor as their reason for buying a ticket. It received an overall ""A-"" from the tracking service's graders, indicating positive word of mouth. But the movie will have to contend with a number of action films in the coming weeks, including ""Haywire,"" ""Underworld: Awakening,"" and ""The Grey."" In second was ""Beauty and the Beast 3D"" with $18.5 million for the three-day frame -- the largest January opening for an animated film (topping 2006′s ""Hoodwinked""). Disney spent less than $10 million converting the 1991 classic to 3-D, so this kind of opening more than justifies the studio's decision to re-release the musical. It also bodes well for Disney's future 3-D re-releases: ""Finding Nemo"" in September, and ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""The Little Mermaid"" in 2013. ""Beast"" should finish the four-day weekend with around $25 million. However, despite ""Beast's"" commendable performance, it's worth pointing out that it fell short of last September's ""The Lion King 3D,"" which debuted to $30.2 million. That could be the result of several factors. For one, ""King"" was a much bigger hit in its original release, earning $312.9 million versus ""Beast's"" $145.9 million. Second, ""Beast"" has been out on 3-D Blu-ray since October, whereas ""King"" didn't come out on Blu-ray until after it returned to theaters. And ""Beast"" had a harder time attracting the interest of boys. According to Disney, just 31 percent of ""Beast 3D's"" audience was male -- compared to 44 percent for ""Lion King 3D."" The weekend's third new release, the gospel-singing dramedy ""Joyful Noise,"" drew a smaller congregation with $11.3 million over the three-day frame. The $25 million movie, starring Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton, is on pace for $14 million by Monday night. Those who saw the film loved it, though, as CinemaScore moviegoers handed the picture an ""A-"" rating. According to the tracking service, 73 percent of the audience was female, and 78 percent was at least 25 years old. A rep for Warner Bros. said the film performed particularly well throughout the South and Midwest. Among holdovers, ""Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" dropped a mild 42 percent for $11.5 million. On Saturday it surpassed the original ""Mission: Impossible's"" $181 million gross to become the action franchise's second-highest grossing film, behind ""Mission: Impossible II"" with $215.4 million. ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" continued to hold up well, too, slipping just 39 percent for $8.4 million, and pushing its cumulative total to $170 million. One film that did not hang on well was last week's winner, ""The Devil Inside."" The R-rated horror flick plummeted 77 percent for $7.9 million. That's the largest second-weekend drop for a wide release since 2009′s ""Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience"" -- now there's a double feature for you! It's also the third-worst decline on record for a film playing in at least 2,000 theaters, behind 2003′s ""Gigli"" and 2009′s ""Friday the 13th."" But don't feel too bad for ""The Devil Inside,"" as it has already consumed $46.2 million on a $1 million budget. ""The Iron Lady,"" starring Meryl Streep as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, expanded from five to 802 theaters and earned a respectable $5.4 million, which was just enough for 10th place. 1.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Learjet departing Chicago's Midway airport last month came within about two plane-lengths of striking a taxiing Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 that had been cleared to cross the same runway, according to a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board. The airborne Learjet passed 62 feet above -- and within 287 feet laterally -- of the Southwest passenger plane, according to the NTSB, which is investigating the incident. According to the NTSB, the co-pilot of the taxiing Southwest jet saw the Learjet and shouted ""Stop"" to the plane's captain, who brought the plane to a halt near the edge of the runway. Air traffic control audio tapes, released by LiveATC.net, a website for aviation enthusiasts, captured conversations between the Southwest crew and controllers in the minutes immediately afterward. ""OK... You just cleared us onto a runway (where) there was a plane taking off,"" one of the pilots said to controllers. ""What technology clears us on the runway when a plane was taking off?"" a pilot added, sounding exasperated. The Southwest crew then radioed another controller. ""We had to hit our brakes and the thing went right over our head,"" the crew said. According to the NTSB's preliminary report, the incident occurred about 9 a.m. CT on December 1, when a Learjet 45 was instructed to line up and wait on runway 31 right. Southwest Flight 844 had landed on a parallel runway -- 31 center. As the Southwest plane was decelerating on the center runway, the Learjet was cleared for takeoff on the right. When an air traffic controller gave the Southwest plane clearance to turn right on a taxiway that crossed the right runway, the two planes came into potential conflict. Kevin Hiatt, a former 737 pilot now with the non-profit Flight Safety Foundation, said it is still unclear what caused the mishap, but credited the Southwest co-pilot for averting potential disaster. ""Fortunately, the first officer was 'heads up' in that cockpit and basically saw the Learjet coming, and told the captain to stop, which he did just prior to entering into the active runway,"" Hiatt said. ""If that Learjet had had any kind of a problem and not lifted off when it did -- they prevented a very serious accident,"" Hiatt said. Hiatt said Midway airport is one of 35 airports equipped with an surface movement detection system known as ASDE-X to detect potential runway conflicts. ""The investigation will probably look into whether ASDE-X was in operation at the time or (whether) the controllers using it or not using it,"" he said. The NTSB said the report is preliminary, and no blame has been assigned in the matter. No one was injured in the event. CNN's Mary Snow contributed to this report.","The Southwest crew tells the tower, ""The thing went right over our head""

"Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- Senegalese police clashed Friday night with protesters, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them from downtown Dakar, where protests have been banned. The unrest was part of the opposition against the candidacy of President Abdoulaye Wade ahead of February 26 elections. After Friday prayers in the Muslim-majority country, police blocked protesters from reaching the capital's Place de l'Independence, the demonstration's planned location. Confrontations occurred less than a mile from the Presidential Palace, in the city's commercial center. At least four people have died in protests in Senegal since January 27, when the country's highest court, the Constitutional Council, cleared the 85-year-old president to run for a third term, government officials have said. The opposition says that the court was compromised and the constitution limits presidents to two terms. He has been in office since 2000. A court ruled in his favor last month after the incumbent argued that he is exempt because he took office before the term limit was put in place. Amadou Sow, a 38-year-old security guard, went downtown on his day off to protest Wade's candidacy and to exercise his right to protest in one of Africa's most stable democracies. ""We're in an electoral campaign and every citizen is free to go where he wants,"" Sow said. ""We have come here to protest peacefully, but the police have prevented us from coming and that's not normal."" Others say that protests have been banned downtown because they disturb the workday in the city's economic hub. ""I can't understand the protests here,"" said Boubacar Sow, 27, who works in the Dakar's large informal sector and is not related to Amadou. ""Because, me, I come here to work, to earn money, and to return home, but not to protest. I work here. ""We are here to protest Wade,"" said Abdoulaye Diouf, a 22-year-old student. ""We dont want him anymore. We are fed up "" Some protesters are also demanding that the Constitutional Council allow three independent candidates, including Grammy-winning musician Youssou N'Dour, to seek the presidency. The court rejected their candidacies last month in the same ruling that granted Wade and 13 others spots on the February ballot. It ruled that the three rejected candidates had failed to gather 10,000 valid signatures. The opposition June 23 Movement, or M23, is named after the date of protests last summer that forced Wade to withdraw a constitutional amendment that would have nearly guaranteed his victory in this month's election. West Africa has a history of political strife, but Senegal has largely maintained peace and has never experienced a military coup.","Protests are banned in downtown Dakar .

"(Budget Travel) -- If you love big-ship cruising but crave a more intimate experience, then the small boats plying the rivers of Europe -- and beyond -- are just the ticket. Budget Travel's Trip Coach answers readers' top questions about river cruising: . Why am I hearing so much about river cruising these days? Imagine sailing the Nile past the temples of Luxor, floating by medieval castles on the German Rhine, or tooling along the Mekong through aging French colonial towns in Laos -- all from your own private balcony. If this sounds pretty appealing to you, you're not alone. About 215,000 North Americans will sail on riverboats this year, up nearly 60 percent since 2004. The spectacular growth has led to a surge of options across Western Europe and in far-flung destinations like China and Russia. It's also ushered in a host of impressive improvements. Outfitters are introducing new ships with larger cabins and upscale touches such as floor-to-ceiling windows and private balconies. Even on older boats, however, river cruising has inherent perks: The ships are smaller, so the service tends to be more personal and the atmosphere among passengers is more familiar. Also, on most lines all excursions, food and drinks (including beer and wine at meals) are included in the cost of the trip, so there's no need to touch your wallet once you set sail. How do I choose the best company for me? Here's a fact that might help simplify things: 75 percent of North American passengers travel with one of just five river cruise operators. Chances are, you will, too. Of the five, the winner of our Readers' Choice poll, Viking River Cruises, is the largest, with 24 percent of the entire market and a reputation for generous promotions, including frequent two-for-one deals. Although it's headquartered in Los Angeles, Viking specializes in European itineraries, with 18 ships that cruise most of the Continent's major waterways. Uniworld River Cruises, the next-biggest, has a more boutique, upscale ambience (think plush guest robes and designer body-care products) to go along with its slightly higher prices. The bargain of the bunch is Grand Circle Travel, which hosts group tours for ""mature Americans"" that tend to be cheaper and longer, albeit on ships that are a bit older and smaller. The most cosmopolitan is Avalon Waterways: One third of its passengers hail from English-speaking countries other than the U.S., and it has the newest fleet in the game, averaging just 2 years old. Rounding out the top five is AMA Waterways, which focuses on European destinations -- and local wines. Thoughtful pairings are served at every meal. Budget Travel: 15 places every kid should see . How can I get the best deal? Unlike the price slashing you'll find on big-ship ocean cruises, which have thousands of cabins to fill, last-minute discounts on riverboats are rare -- all the more reason to plan strategically. If your travel dates are flexible, you can often find two-for-one deals in the off-season (which in most of Europe is late autumn to early spring). If not, consider inviting friends and family and angle for a bulk discount. Every operator has one. With Avalon, for instance, a group's 16th passenger comes along for free. Finally, think about booking your trip à la carte instead of buying one of the packages that operators typically offer, which often lump together cruising, land tours and hotel accommodations. Booking just the boat portion of the trip can save you big. Uniworld's 12-day Highlights of China & the Yangtze package, for example, starts at $3,099. But only three nights of the itinerary are actually spent aboard a riverboat. You could choose to book the cruising portion separately, through Uniworld's charter, Victoria Cruises, plan the rest of your trip yourself, and sail for as little as $470. Budget Travel: The world's most amazing hotel pools . What about extra costs? The travel world is rife with hidden fees these days -- except here, for the most part. Some companies include port charges (a standard fee of about $100 to $150 for a 7 night European cruise) in the original listed price, but others mention it only in the fine print and charge passengers separately. As mentioned, alcoholic drinks are free during mealtime on most ships, but if you're craving a cocktail at some other point, that will be extra, too. One thing to note: Gratuities aren't automatically added on to river cruise bills as they are with ocean cruises. At the end of a river cruise, envelopes are passed around with suggested (but entirely voluntary) tip amounts written on the front. Budget Travel: 5 popular European river cruises . Can I bring my kids along? Keep these guidelines in mind: If you're under 50, you'll be considered young; if you're under 30, you'll be a downright novelty; and if you're under 4, then sorry. No dice. Some companies, however, are starting to offer family-travel incentives. Uniworld, for example, is introducing two new itineraries this fall in which 4- to 18-year-olds travel for half price. That said, whether you want to bring them is another matter.

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- The United States is prepared for ""any contingency"" when it comes to dealing with North Korea, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta told CNN. ""We're within an inch of war almost every day in that part of the world, and we just have to be very careful about what we say and what we do,"" Panetta said Wednesday on ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" During a wide-ranging interview at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Panetta and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton talked about Syria, the Secret Service and North Korea. The two were in Belgium for meetings to prepare for a NATO summit in Chicago next month. Panetta's assessment of North Korea followed last week's launch by Pyongyang of a long-range rocket. Despite the failure of the launch -- with the rocket breaking apart 81 seconds after liftoff, it drew condemnation from the United States and countries in the region. When asked whether the threat posed by North Korea kept him awake at night, Panetta said: ""Unfortunately these days, there's a hell of a lot that keeps me awake. But that's one that tops the list."" Since the failed rocket launch, there has been speculation that North Korea would carry out a nuclear test -- something it did before following a failed rocket launch. Panetta said a nuclear test would be considered a provocation and ""worsen our relationship,"" though he refused to discuss specific action the United States would take in response. International leaders had urged North Korea to cancel the launch, but Pyongyang refused to back down, insisting the operation is for peaceful purposes. North Korea said the rocket was designed to carry an observation satellite, though the United States, South Korea and Japan said it was a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. The use of ballistic missile technology is a violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874. Kim Jong Un, the grandson of Kim Il Sung, became the new head of the secretive regime in December, following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. The leadership transition has added to uncertainties about Pyongyang's intentions. ""We really are waiting and watching to see whether he can be the kind of leader the North Korean people need. If he just follows in the footsteps of his father, we don't expect much other than the kind of provocative behavior and the deep failure of the political and economic elite to take care of their own people,"" Clinton said. Clinton said it was too early to determine if there was a prospect for a shift in relations on the Korean peninsula with the younger Kim, who lived outside of North Korea for a time. ""We believe that he may have some hope that the conditions in North Korea can change. But again, we'll watch and wait,"" Clinton said. ""He gave a speech the other day that was analyzed as being some of the same old stuff and some possible new approach. "" As a result of the launch, the United States has suspended an agreement reached in February to provide food aid to North Korea. North Korea has been plagued by famine for years and unable to feed its 25 million people. The country lost a million people to famine in the 1990s. A report last year by aid agencies, who were invited to North Korea, found that the food shortage was so severe that North Koreans were being forced to forage for wild grasses and herbs. ""The United States, as you know, was willing to try to reach out to him, which we did,"" Clinton said. ""We had several high-level meetings. We agreed to provide some food aid in return for their ending some of their uranium enrichment and missile development, and they do what has been already termed by Leon (Panetta) and the rest of the world as a provocative action. ""It's hard for us to tell right now, is this the way it will be with this new leader or does he feel like he has to earn his own credibility in order to have a new path for North Korea?"" North Korea had drawn world attention with the announcement of the launch, which came during a two-day nuclear summit in South Korea that brought together leaders from the United States, Russia, China and dozens. The launch also coincided with celebrations surrounding the 100th anniversary of the birth of its late founding leader, Kim Il Sung. The regime had invited international journalists and space experts to view the launch pad and the satellite, and called the effort ""an inspiring deed and an event of historic significance."" The last time Pyongyang carried out what it described as a satellite launch, in April 2009, the U.N. Security Council condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated. When asked about recent comments made by Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney who said North Korea's rocket launch highlights the ""incompetence"" of the Obama administration, Panetta said: ""It's pretty clear that this administration took a firm stand."" ""The fact is it was provocative, and we have made it very clear to them they should not taken any additional, provocative actions,"" Panetta said. ""I think that was a clear, strong message that not only our country, but the world sent to North Korea. That's the way, frankly, that United States ought to behave."" On the unrest in Syria, Clinton said it was a ""long shot"" that Russia and China would change their position and allow for a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for an end to the violence and a transition of power. Russia and China have previously vetoed resolutions condemning the violence in Syria. ""There doesn't seem to be any willingness on their part to go further than where we are right now. But this is a fast-changing situation,"" Clinton said. There are a number of countries concerned about what will happen if Syria descends into a civil war or cause a regional conflict, she said. ""I don't think we're half way through this story yet,"" Clinton said. On the alleged misconduct involving prostitutes by Secret Service agents and military personnel in Cartagena, Columbia, Panetta called allegations ""disturbing."" ""The reason it was disturbing is that whether it takes place in Colombia or any other country or in the United States, expect that our people behave according to the highest standards of conduct,"" Panetta said. ""That obviously didn't happen here. As a result we're investigating the matter, and as a result of that investigation we'll hold these people accountable."" CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Hillary Clinton and Leon Panetta sit for a joint interview at NATO in Brussels .

"(CNN) -- Is a parent's love for a child guaranteed? Let's assume for a moment that it is and that parents love their children unconditionally. Is it then possible to love your child but not to like them? What about fear? Can a mother both love her child and also be in constant, mortal fear of them? What about loyalty? Can a mother ever betray her child? What is the proper reaction when one's son commits a massacre at his high school? These are some of the questions faced by Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) with respect to her son Kevin (played by Rock Duer as a toddler, Jasper Newell as a grade schooler and Ezra Miller as an adolescent, all to chilling effect). Presented in a back-and-forth, non-linear and occasionally all-too obvious way, Lynn Ramsey's ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is the ultimate cautionary tale for prospective parents. As an infant, Kevin screams constantly, to the point where Eva parks his stroller next to a construction site in an attempt to drown out the tyke's wailing. Alas, even the jackhammers are no relief and it's only when being held by his father, Franklin (John C. Reilly) that Kevin relaxes. This is but a snapshot of what's to come and how Kevin will play mother against father in the coming years. As he ages, Kevin is, to Eva and to the audience, if not to Franklin, increasingly creepy. He refuses to be potty trained well into middle childhood and almost never smiles. He even shows a true malevolence, seemingly taking pleasure in making life difficult for Eva, while acting as Daddy's little boy. According to flashbacks/Eva's memory, her husband is absolutely clueless when it come to their son, and the couple's relationship is one of the aspects of the film that left me cold. Franklin is kind of a ... dope, for lack of a better word. When she was younger, Eva was something of a free spirit who traveled the world in a rather Bohemian existence and short of an unplanned pregnancy, I couldn't see anything in Franklin that would have attracted someone like the young Eva. Yet here they are, married and living in the 'burbs, which is exactly where Eva doesn't want to live. The situation serves to put Eva on edge, which she seems to have been since Kevin's birth, and at one point she loses her temper, breaking his arm. While he covers for her with the doctor and Daddy, it's not in a good way but rather more an ""I have dirt on you, Mommy"" way. By this time, Eva is more or less convinced that Kevin is damaged goods and things only get worse when she decides (without consulting Franklin) to have another child, perhaps in the hopes of getting it right, the second time. The resulting daughter Celia (Ashley Gerasimovich) is everything Kevin isn't: happy, effervescent, playful and loving, a daughter both parents can love. Of course Kevin instantly hates her. ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is full of hints and foreshadowing (but considering much of the film is told as Eva's memory, it could just as easily be called ""after-shadowing"") and this is where I found most fault with the film. Ramsey's screenplay (written with her husband Rory Stewart Kinnear, from the novel by Lionel Shriver) is a little too obvious and the symbolism is laid on a bit too thick. Repeated shots of Eva and Kevin dunking their faces into water (seen from under the water), a bow and arrow motif and the endless use of tomatoes, tomato soup, red wine and red paint as metaphors blood are beyond obvious, and the film can hardly be called subtle: The first time we see Celia, she has an eye patch. Gee, I wonder how she got injured? Tilda Swinton is indeed fantastic and given the long list of awards and nominations she's been racking up for ""Kevin"" over the past few months, I'd say there's a better-than-even chance of her picking up a second Oscar nomination later this month (she won an Academy Award for best supporting actress for ""Michael Clayton"" in 2008). Eva is a tortured soul. She knows Kevin is a bad seed, and can't seem to fix it. She hopes loving him is enough, but she seems to know, deep down, that it isn't. Then there's the possibility that it's her fault, somehow. Was she a bad mother? Did she pass on some dormant genetic defect to her son? Eva starts medicating her anxiety about Kevin with wine and pills, shuffling her way through life in a state of near oblivion, all the while becoming a pariah in what is to her, the ninth circle of hell: The suburbs. The community blames Eva at least as much as she blames herself and this is another aspect of the film that bothered me. After what she's gone through, it strains believability that an entire town would turn against her because of something her child did, no matter how horrific. Far more a horror movie than a family drama, ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" is an uneven update on the ""bad seed"" story, kept afloat almost entirely by Swinton's magnificent portrayal of a completely broken mother. ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" is rated R (Restricted. Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The violence is more suggested than graphic but in context, that makes it all the more unsettling.","""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is the ultimate cautionary tale for prospective parents .

"(CNN) -- When Piers Morgan asked Steve Carell and David Steinberg about comedians' handling of Election 2012, the CNN host noted that there have been quite a few ""fantastically funny"" moments in the GOP race in particular. ""Do you thank God every day that these things happen?"" asked Morgan. ""Yes,"" answered Steinberg, ""This is a gift from God to comedians the likes of which we have never seen."" ""It's a ship of fools that is -- it's just unbelievable,"" said Steinberg. ""I used to have a theory that I took almost through all the presidencies. And it was that you're either -- it's like the Three Stooges. You're either a Moe, who's in charge, or a Larry, who wants to be a Moe, or you're Curly, who is nuts and totally just off the page."" Steinberg and Carell are guests on Thursday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" The New York Times recently hailed Steinberg, a TV director, as ""a comic institution."" Among his credits are ""Friends,"" ""Seinfeld,"" ""Mad About You,"" ""Newhart,"" ""Weeds"" and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" Steinberg's latest project, ""Inside Comedy,"" is a joint venture with Carell. The documentary-style series about comedians airs Thursday nights on Showtime. Steinberg called the new series ""unique in the way in which the comedians talk about what they do. ... There is no audience. There is no pressure. They're not on, but they're funny."" On ""Inside Comedy,"" the featured comedians talk about their childhood comedy heroes, among other things. Carell, who called the entertainers' comedic influences ""a matter of personal taste,"" counted Peter Sellers, Steve Martin and Jack Lemmon among his influences growing up. Each episode of ""Inside Comedy"" is a standalone documentary. Episode four, in which Billy Crystal will be interviewed, airs Monday night. It also features Brad Garrett and Martin Short. Steinberg conducts the interviews in the half-hour series. ""I think David is the best interviewer because he puts people at ease,"" said Carell. ""Only because, you know, you have all of these people who do tend to be on a lot. But he puts them in a comfort zone and allows them to not only be funny, but to be themselves. So you find out a little bit more about them in a personal way, which I think is great."" Steinberg also noted that ""Inside Comedy"" sets out to debunk certain myths about stand-up comics. One such myth: Comedians have to be so-called wounded souls to achieve success. Steinberg and Carell pointed out that ""Seinfeld"" helped break that barrier and also made it socially acceptable to be a comedian. ""When I started out,"" Steinberg said, ""being a comedian was not a great thing. If your girlfriend brought you home to your mother and said he's a comedian, they wouldn't be happy about it. But now, it's become corporate with 'Seinfeld.' "" Steinberg further noted the show fueled the incorrect assumption that comedy meant big bucks. ""A lot of young people make the mistake of going into comedy just because it's a lucrative business, as opposed to earlier, even Steven and I, we were in 'Second City,' we never... thought of going beyond 'Second City' in Chicago."" ""If I could trap you both on a desert island separately,"" asked Morgan, ""and you could have one comedian with you to make you laugh for the rest of your days, who would you take?"" Carell said he would take Alan Arkin ""because he makes, one-to-one, he makes me laugh more than anyone I've ever met ... he's so dry and so acerbic. I love being around the man."" Steinberg said he would take either Groucho Marx, whom he referred to as ""acerbic"" and ""fun,"" or Martin Short, who he called ""nonstop funny all the time."" Morgan pointed out that when ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" was released, Carell was catapulted into an ""international comedic superstar"" although he did have a successful career in comedy beforehand. Carell, who has two young children, said that his life didn't change all that much and that he still goes to the movies and the mall like anyone else. ""I certainly have more money than I did,"" Carell said, ""but my home life, my family life, all of that really has stayed essentially the same."" Carell said success coming relatively late in life for him was a good thing because ""I sort of had my ducks in a row at that point. I had figured things out, for the most part, in terms of my goals and my wants and dreams and what was giving me happiness, ultimately. So I think if it had happened early in life, I don't know if it would have been the same story."" When Morgan asked Carell about ""The Office,"" he referred to Ricky Gervais as ""the monster that spawned all this,"" and noted that Carell's version of the role was ""more empathetic."" For his version of ""The Office,"" Carell felt that the cliche about television audiences inviting TV characters into their homes every week rang true in this case. Carell, who starred in the American version of ""The Office"" on NBC for seven seasons, called Gervais' version ""excellent,"" noting that Gervais knew going into it that the British version of the office would only last for 13 episodes, as is common with UK television series. ""He knew that the run would be limited,"" said Carell, ""and he could play this guy that was just insufferable and a truly terrible person."" Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- At an estimated 22 inches tall, Chandra Bahadur Dangi's body is the size of a large infant. But Dangi, at 72, is full grown. Sunday, he may be declared the world's shortest man if Guinness World Records measures his height and indeed verifies he stands 22 inches tall. Dangi flew to the capital, Kathmandu, from his home in southwestern Nepal on instructions from Guinness World Records officials. Dangi, who sports a traditional hat and tailor-made clothing, is in high spirits. ""I feel good that I will be declared the world's shortest man,"" he said. Dangi says he has never taken any kind of medication or been examined by a doctor. He has only suffered from fevers, coughs and colds, and when he does, he has a remedy: ""At such times I drink hot water and have tumeric power dissolved in water. The fever lasts for two to three days."" He says the secret behind his health is his constitution. ""I haven't been ill probably because my body is good,"" he said, his eyes sparkling. The seventh sibling of a family of six brothers and two sisters, Dangi left his village for the first time five years ago. This is his first visit to the Himalayan capital. Asked why he did not stake a claim earlier to be declared the shortest man, he said his family was unaware of such a record because they are uneducated. Guinness World Records said the current record holder for the world's shortest man is Filipino Junrey Balawing, 18, at 23.5 inches tall. In his remote village in Dang district, about 350 kilometers (217 miles) from Kathmandu, Dangi spends his days making placemats and head straps for villagers to carry heavy loads on their backs. ""He would also look after the buffalos and cows,"" said his nephew, Dolak Dangi. ""Although he could not chase them or tie them, he would call us if they strayed."" After all, buffalo milk is Dangi's favorite. He has been a teetotaler all his life and does not drink tea or coffee. Rather than rice, the staple food of Nepalis, he like chapatis, or flatbread, made of wheat. ""He eats in small portions,"" said his nephew. Although he never attended school, a teacher came to Dangi's house. He has a fifth-grade education. Despite his height, no one has mistreated Dangi. ""Everyone has been good to me,"" he said in his high-pitched voice, which at times is barely audible. Sometimes, his nephew, who accompanied him, had to translate what Dangi was saying. A lumber contractor, Ram Bhadur B.K., came across Dangi five years ago when he had gone to his village to clear the road to cut trees. ""I wanted to make him public,"" B.K. said. The first time Dangi left his village he went to a fair at a nearby town where thousands of people paid money to look at him. ""Now I want to go around the world,"" Dangi said nonchalantly. Dangi does not remember his father and his mother, who died when he was about 16 years old. His immediate older brother and his family have looked after him. Three of his five brothers were less than 4 feet tall, while his two sisters and two brothers are of average height. Dangi said that he does not have many wishes because he is small. ""I can never be tall,"" he said. But he does have one regret: never marrying. CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","Chandra Bahadur Dangi lives in a Nepali village .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine announced Tuesday she will retire rather than seek re-election this year, surprising colleagues and perhaps casting the future of her seat in doubt. The decision was made ""after an extraordinary amount of reflection and consideration,"" she said in a statement. Snowe, who turned 65 last week, was first elected to the U.S. House in 1978 and then to the Senate in 1994. She is the first woman to serve in both chambers of a state legislature and the U.S. Congress. Snowe was known as a moderate who sometimes sided with Democrats in the increasingly partisan environment of Washington politics. Her statement cited the partisan divide. ""I have no doubt I would have won re-election,"" Snowe said, describing her political service in Maine and Washington as ""an indescribable honor and immeasurable privilege."" While her motivation and sense of responsibility remain, she continued, ""I do find it frustrating, however, that an atmosphere of polarization and 'my way or the highway' ideologies has become pervasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions."" ""Unfortunately, I do not realistically expect the partisanship of recent years in the Senate to change over the short term,"" Snowe said. ""So at this stage of my tenure in public service, I have concluded that I am not prepared to commit myself to an additional six years in the Senate."" The White House released a statement praising Snowe's bipartisan efforts. ""For almost four decades, Olympia Snowe has served the people of the great state of Maine. ... From her unwavering support for our troops, to her efforts to reform Wall Street, to fighting for Maine's small businesses, Sen. Snowe's career demonstrates how much can be accomplished when leaders from both parties come together to do the right thing for the American people."" Initial reaction from colleagues indicated Snowe's decision was unexpected. ""I was surprised. I know that she's been quite frustrated with the lack of civility in Washington and the fact that she's a bridge builder -- and it was more and more difficult to do that. But we were all surprised here in Maine that she would make the decision,"" said Maine GOP Chairman Charlie Webster. ""It's going to shake things up in Maine politics."" Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, said she was ""devastated"" to learn of Snowe's decision not to seek re-election. ""I know this was an incredibly difficult decision for Olympia,"" said Collins, who lauded Snowe as ""a leader who sought solutions, not political advantage."" Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York expressed surprise at the news when told by CNN. ""We'll miss her,"" Schumer said. ""She's a good, good lady and an example of ... sometimes how the roughness of the political world can affect things. She's great, and she'll be missed by people on both sides of the aisle."" With Snowe in the race, two of the top political handicappers -- the Cook Political Report and the Rothenberg Political Report -- had considered the seat ""safe Republican"" in the November election. Democrats hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate but are defending 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs in November, including those of two independents who caucus with the Democrats. Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, called Snowe's departure an ""unexpected opportunity."" ""Maine is now a top pick-up opportunity for Senate Democrats,"" Cecil said in a statement. ""If there is one place in the country that is likely to reject the extreme, anti-middle class, divisive Republican agenda it is Maine. Democrats not only hold a strong registration advantage in the state, but this is a state that the president won by 17 points in 2008 and will likely win by a significant margin this year, as well."" However, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said his party remains ""well-positioned to win back a Senate majority in November."" ""Maine has a proud history of electing independent leaders, including a Republican governor in 2010, and while this will be a key battleground in the fall, I am confident it will remain in Republican hands,"" Cornyn said in a statement. The Maine GOP chairman said it's too early to tell yet whether Democrats could potentially pick up the seat. ""We've got a number of qualified people that could run,"" said Webster. Two Republican candidates already announced primary challenges to Snowe -- former Lisbon Falls Selectman Scott D'Amboise and tea party activist Andrew Ian Dodge. In addition, two Democrats being mentioned as potential candidates were businesswoman and 2010 gubernatorial candidate Rosa Scarcelli and state Rep. Emily Cain. U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, was also hailed as a possible candidate. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee launched a campaign shortly after Snowe's announcement to draft the Democratic representative into running. The group, which claims 6,000 members in Maine and close to a million nationwide, praised Pingree for having a ""bold progressive voice."" CNN's Ted Barrett, Deirdre Walsh, Rebecca Stewart, Tom Cohen and Shannon Travis contributed to this report.","White House praises Sen. Olympia Snowe for her bipartisan leadership .

"(CNN) -- Legendary wrestling figure Captain Lou Albano, perhaps best known for his association with pop singer Cyndi Lauper, died Wednesday, according to World Wrestling Entertainment. Captain Lou Albano reached a new level of fame in the '80s with his association with Cyndi Lauper. Albano, 76, was ""one of the company's most popular and charismatic legends,"" the company said in a statement. The cause of death was not immediately disclosed. ""Albano began his storied career with Vincent J. McMahon in the 1960s as one half of 'The Sicilians' tag team with his partner Tony Altimore,"" the WWE said. ""He will be greatly missed by the WWE and his fans."" Albano, who was with the WWE from 1983 to 1996, was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1996. He started as a tag team wrestler in the 1950s but became a successful manager of champion wrestlers in the 1970s, according to a biography on the WWE Web site. Albano was recognizable by his penchant for unbuttoned Hawaiian shirts and a trademark beard, which was usually bound by a rubber band. His persona earned him the distinction of ""one of the most hated men"" in wrestling for 15 years, the WWE biography said. Albano's image evolved in the 1980s, when he teamed with Lauper on several music videos, such as ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun,"" and wrestling appearances. As his celebrity status grew, Albano landed acting jobs, including a role on several episodes of the ""Miami Vice"" TV series, the biography said. Albano became a cartoon in 1989, when he was the voice of Mario ""Jumpman"" Mario for 17 episodes of ""The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!"" according to the Internet Movie Database. CNN's Jack Hannah and Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Captain Lou Albano, known for association with Cyndi Lauper, dead at 76 .

"(CNN) -- It could prove to be a pivotal moment in the Italian Serie A title race -- Juventus escaped with a 1-1 draw at AC Milan on Saturday after Sulley Muntari's first-half goal was controversially disallowed despite clearly crossing the line. With champions and league leaders Milan leading 1-0 at the time, Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon desperately clawed back the Ghana midfielder's header from a corner -- and the referee waved play on to the dismay of the home players and their fans. ""That incident that certainly falsified the result. Either the line was drawn wrong and was a bit too big,"" Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri told reporters. ""There is no need to see the replays. It was pretty obvious from all around the stadium."" The visitors also had a goal disallowed in the second half as Alessandro Matri was deemed to be offside in a very marginal decision, but the substitute leveled in the 83rd minute with his 10th goal this season to maintain Juve's unbeaten record after 24 matches. Antonio Conte's team were reduced to 10 men five minutes later when Arturo Vidal was sent off for a cynical foul on Mark van Bommel, but held on to stay one point behind Milan with a game in hand. The Rossoneri had taken the lead after 14 minutes when Antonio Nocerino fired in a deflected shot against his former club, whose defender Leonardo Bonucci gave the ball away to Robinho with a careless pass. January loan signing Muntari thought he had added to midfielder Nocerino's eighth league goal this season, but the linesman did not flag for the goal despite replays showing the ball went well over the Juve line before Buffon intervened. Third-placed Udinese and Lazio both trail Juve by eight points, but can cut the deficit on Sunday with victories against Bologna and Fiorentina respectively. In Saturday's other match, mid-table Genoa snatched a 2-2 draw against Parma thanks to two late goals from striker Rodrigo Palacio. The Argentine striker followed up his saved penalty to pull one back in the 78th minute, then took his tally to 14 for this season deep into time added on. Parma led in the sixth minute through defender Massimo Gobbi, then striker Sergio Floccari made it 2-0 eight minutes after the break against his former team. In Spain, Levante moved up into the fourth and last Champions League qualification place after snatching a 2-1 win at European rivals Espanyol in Saturday's late match. Substitute Ruben Suarez smashed in a freekick off the defensive wall in the 89th minute to seal the points after it had looked like the Barcelona-based hosts had earned a draw thanks to a 75th-minute header from Nigeria striker Kala Uche, who came on as a substitute. It was Valencia-based Levante's first win in nine La Liga matches. Malaga had temporaily taken fourth after thrashing bottom club Real Zaragoza 5-1, but ended the day in fifth -- one point above Espanyol. Racing Santander and Sporting Gijon remained in the bottom three after sharing the points in a 1-1 draw, while Real Betis and Getafe had the same result in a mid-table clash. Spain's top three teams -- leaders Real Madrid, champions Barcelona and third-placed Valencia -- will play on Sunday.","Juventus remain the only unbeaten team in Italy after 1-1 draw at AC Milan on Saturday .

"(CNN)  -- Rafael Nadal claimed his first Australian Open title and denied a tearful Roger Federer his 14th grand slam crown after another epic five-set victory, 7-5 3-6 7-6 3-6 6-2 in Melbourne on Sunday. Nadal holds the trophy as an emotional Federer takes in his defeat. As expected, it proved a titanic struggle between the two leading players in world tennis, who were meeting for the first time since Nadal took Federer's Wimbledon title last July in another five-set classic. Nadal, who played the longest match in Australian Open history to beat Fernando Verdasco in his semifinal, was expected to show signs of tiredness, but it was Federer who wilted in the decider. He dropped his service as Nadal led 4-1 and faltered again when serving at 2-5 down, saving three match points but eventually succumbing as he hit a forehand long. It left Nadal the winner after four hours 23 minutes of seesaw action to claim his sixth grand slam title and cement his position as world number one. At the prize presentation a bitterly disappointed Federer admitted he had ""felt better"" before shedding tears as the crowd gave him a standing ovation. He recovered to congratulate Nadal, the two men sharing a warm embrace of mutual respect. ""It is very special for me. It's a dream win, one grand slam on a hard court,"" said the 22-year-old Nadal, the first Spanish player to win the Australian Open. ""I've worked very hard all my life to improve my tennis outside of clay. I'm very happy, very happy to win the title."" The match started with both exchanging early breaks of service until Nadal pulled ahead with a further break to claim the advantage. The second set followed a similar pattern, with an early exchange of breaks, but this time it was the Swiss ace who edged it as  Nadal netted to lose a marathon eighth game. Federer looked to be getting on top and had no less than six break points on Nadal's service in the third set, the Spaniard coming back from 0-40 down in a pivotal service game. In the tiebreak it was Nadal who pulled ahead again, reaching set point with a rare volleyed winner and sealing it as Federer double faulted. Federer showed his fighting qualities to force a decider, but once again it was his nemesis Nadal who proved the stronger despite spending nearly 10 hours on court in his final two matches at Melbourne Park.","Rafael Nadal beats Roger Federer to win Australian Open title .

"(CNN) -- Apple's CEO Tim Cook says the company ""cares about every worker"" in its factories and that ""no one in (the) industry is doing more to improve working conditions than Apple."" Of course, when it comes to issues of corporate responsibility, talk is cheap. What matters is not what Apple says, but what it does. And what Apple does in its vast global supply chain has been well-documented, which is why the company is in public relations overdrive, frantic to protect its once pristine corporate image. Consider the fate that befell workers at a factory in Chengdu, China, that makes products for Apple. In May, independent investigators issued a report documenting grave dangers to workers at the facility. They warned the factory was failing to control the profusion of dust produced by the manufacture of aluminum cases for the Ipad 2. When a factory is suffused with aluminum dust, there is a high risk of explosion. Apple ignored the report and refused to meet with the authors, the investigators said. It did nothing to address the danger. Two weeks later, the factory exploded, killing four workers and injuring 18. In the wake of the explosion, Apple said its suppliers took measures to control aluminum dust. But despite this, in December 2011, another explosion, at an Apple supplier factory in Shanghai, injured 61 workers. Grievous labor rights problems at Apple's supplier factories have been known for years, including the spate of worker suicides in 2010 at the giant plant in Shenzhen, China, known as ""Ipod City."" At this factory -- owned, like the Chengdu plant, by Apple's biggest supplier, Foxconn -- more than a dozen workers took their own lives by throwing themselves from the roof of the factory's overcrowded dormitories, in apparent protest of the brutal treatment facing workers at the facility. (Foxconn reportedly responded by putting up nets outside the dorms and making workers sign pledges not to kill themselves.) In recent weeks, public awareness of these issues has increased exponentially, thanks to a huge jump in media interest, raising Apple's public relations problems from a low simmer to a rolling boil. When a company comes under this kind of pressure, sometimes genuine change in policy can occur. The more typical response is a mere change in rhetoric. This is the route Apple is choosing. Apple's major move has been to announce that it has joined an organization called the Fair Labor Association, which will ""audit"" Apple's factories. According to Apple, the Fair Labor Association is an independent watchdog that will work tenaciously to hold Apple and its suppliers accountable. Unfortunately, while there are some fine people at the association, the organization is not the independent watchdog Apple claims it to be. Indeed, most of its money -- millions of dollars per year -- comes from the very companies whose labor practices it is supposed to scrutinize. Although Apple has not disclosed its financial relationship with the Fair Labor Association, it is likely now the organization's largest funder. Moreover, on the association's board of directors sit executives of major corporations such as Nike, Adidas and agribusiness giant Syngenta. The job of these executives is to represent the interests of other member companies, such as Apple. Under the Fair Labor Association's rules, the company representatives on the board exercise veto power over major decisions. Independence, as most people understand the term, means an organization is not funded and governed by the companies it is charged with investigating. Despite the financial relationship, Apple argues that the Fair Labor Association will act independently and that the association's review of Apple's factories will probably be ""the most detailed factory audit in the history of mass manufacturing."" Early indications are not encouraging. Just one day after launching what was supposed to be a long and uncompromising investigation of Foxconn's Ipad plant in Shenzhen, the association was already issuing public praise of Foxconn and Apple. On Wednesday, CNNMoney/Fortune ran an article with the headline, ""Apple iPad plant is 'way, way above average,' says inspector."" Fair Labor Association President Auret van Heerden said this about Foxconn to Reuters: ""The facilities are first-class. ... I was very surprised when I walked in the door how tranquil it is. ..."" The CNNMoney/Fortune article notes that ""whether intended or not, van Heerden's remarks served to support (Apple CEO) Cook's contention that no one has done more than Apple to address the working conditions at factories."" Van Heerden reached these conclusions after a guided tour of the factory provided by Foxconn's owner, Terry Gou. The views of Gou, one of the wealthiest men in Asia, are well-known to Foxconn workers because, as punishment for displeasing their managers, workers are sometimes forced to spend hours writing out copies of his personal sayings. Clearly, Apple's partnership with the Fair Labor Association is not, in and of itself, going to usher in radical change. So what steps would Apple take if it were genuinely committed to improving its labor practices? For starters, it would open its factories for inspection and worker trainings to genuinely independent groups such as Hong Kong-based SACOM, the organization whose report on the Chengdu factory could have saved the lives of the workers killed there in May, had Apple paid it heed. And if Apple genuinely ""cared about every worker,"" it would pay every worker a living wage -- enough for workers to achieve a minimally decent standard of living, support their families and even save a bit toward a better future. Today, barely 1% of the retail price of an Ipad goes to the workers who make it; 33% goes to Apple's profits. Apple's profits are so high, and its global labor costs so low, that it could triple the wages of its 700,000 manufacturing workers and help them achieve a living wage (just a few dollars an hour in China), and still make $40 billion a year. A wage increase of 16% to 25% at Foxconn, announced today as Apple's public relations blitz reaches a crescendo, doesn't come close. Next time you are at the Apple Store, consider bellying up to the Genius Bar and asking why the most profitable company in the history of technology can't pay its workers a living wage and why, if Apple is really ready to open itself to independent scrutiny, it doesn't allow inspections by organizations in which it is not a dues-paying member.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A plane carrying dozens of British vacationers skidded on landing in Spain's Canary Islands on Friday morning, briefly causing the closure of the runway but causing no injuries, the country's airport authority said. The Air Europa Boeing-737 sits parked at the end of the runway at the airport in Lanzarote. The Thomas Cook-chartered Air Europa flight was arriving at the airport on the island of Lanzarote at 7:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) when it skidded off the runway, spokespeople for the airport authority told CNN. However two Air Europa spokespeople disagreed and said the plane came to rest at the end of the runway's asphalt. The flight from Glasgow, Scotland was carrying 74 passengers and six crew members. A spokesman for travel agent Thomas Cook told the British Press Association: ""We can confirm that an Air Europa flight (AEA196), which was charted by Thomas Cook, was involved in a runway incident at Lanzarote's Arrecife Airport this morning. ""Thomas Cook staff were on hand at the airport to assist all passengers and can confirm that all guests are now en route to their holiday hotels. ""Thomas Cook has called on Air Europa and the airport authorities to provide a full explanation."" Air Europa said it was investigating what caused the plane to skid. The plane was not damaged, the company added. The incident caused the airport runway to be closed for three hours, during which time the plane was removed from the runway, the airport spokesman said. The runway reopened at 10:25 a.m. (6:25 a.m. ET), he said. Air Europa was founded in 1986 and is based in Palma, on the Spanish island of Majorca. Its fleet comprises of 32 modern Boeing aircraft and an Airbus A340, PA said.","UK plane with 80 crew and passengers skids on landing in Lanzarote Friday .

"(CNN) -- Scores of would-be swashbucklers found themselves in need of rescuing Saturday night when their ship -- the Pirate's Ransom -- ran aground in west Florida, a government spokeswoman said. The pirate-themed ship was actually one of two vessels in and around Clearwater whose passengers inadvertently celebrated New Year's Eve on shore, rather that at sea. The other ship -- the Island Time -- went aground while trying to take some of the first ship's passengers ashore, said city public safety spokeswoman Elizabeth Watts. Eventually, fire and police boats ended up ferrying the 100 passengers on the Pirate's Ransom safely back to shore, as intended. One 77-year-old female passenger was ""checked out at the scene, but refused treatment,"" said Watts.

"(CNN) -- The director of a documentary about a notorious Ugandan warlord that went viral after its release this month was picked up by police Thursday in San Diego after several people reported a man running through the streets in his underwear, screaming, sources said Friday. While San Diego police declined to provide the identity of the 33-year-old man, an official familiar with the case confirmed him to be Jason Russell. Police said the man, who 911 callers said was interfering with traffic and acting irrationally, was not arrested and was transported to a local medical facility. Russell is one of the founders of the San Diego-based nonprofit group Invisible Children, which produced the half-hour film about warlord Joseph Kony. ""Kony 2012"" skyrocketed to popularity on YouTube, propelled by thousands of posts on Twitter and Facebook, garnering nearly 80 million views since its March 5 release. Ben Keesey, the group's chief executive, issued a statement Friday confirming that Russell was hospitalized for ""exhaustion, dehydration and malnutrition."" ""The past two weeks have taken a severe emotional toll on all of us, Jason especially, and that toll manifested itself in an unfortunate incident yesterday,"" Keesey said. The popularity of the film led to a flurry of media appearances for Russell and his fellow Invisible Children co-founders and prompted scrutiny from some who argued that the social media frenzy was too little, too late. The group has said it hopes the film and other efforts will make Kony a household name and drum up international support to halt killings, rapes, abuses and abductions committed by his group, the Lord's Resistance Army, in central Africa. Kony has operated in central Africa for two decades and is wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. In October, the United States sent 100 combat-equipped troops on a mission to kill or capture Kony. CNN's Rachel Wells contributed to this report.","Source: Jason Russell was picked up by police after running in the street in his underwear .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Philip was treated successfully for a blocked coronary artery on Friday and will remain at the hospital for observation, the Press Association reported, citing a statement from Buckingham Palace. Earlier in the day, Philip was taken from Sandringham to the cardiothoracic unit at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge after complaining of chest pains, according to a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman. Tests determined his chest pains were caused by a blocked artery, which was ""treated successfully by the minimally invasive procedure of coronary stenting,"" the PA reported. Philip, the husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, is also known as the Duke of Edinburgh. He will stay at the hospital for the ""immediate Christmas period"" for observation, the agency said. The royal family traditionally spends Christmas at Sandringham, the private home of four generations of British monarchs. Philip turned 90 in June, at which point a Buckingham Palace spokesman said the Duke of Edinburgh would gradually ""wind down"" his workload. ""I reckon I've done my bit, I want to enjoy myself now ... have less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say,"" Philip said then, in an interview with the BBC. He married then-Princess Elizabeth on November 20, 1947, in Westminster Abbey, and has become the longest-serving consort in British history. Philip has made more than 5,000 public speeches during his working life, according to Buckingham Palace.

"(CNN) -- A body found Tuesday in California is that of Brittany Killgore, the missing wife of a deployed Marine, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said Wednesday. Killgore, 22, was last seen alive Friday night when she left her apartment wearing an evening dress, heading out on a date with 45-year-old Marine Staff Sgt. Louis Perez, investigators said. Killgore had recently filed for divorce from her husband, Marine Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore, who was serving with an artillery unit in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, they said. He left for the United States on emergency leave when he learned his wife was missing. Two people are in custody in connection with the case. One is Perez, who was questioned after a friend filed a missing persons report for Killgore, then later arrested on charges of possession of a stolen assault rifle. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department said Perez is being ""actively investigated"" in connection with Killgore's death. The other person in custody is Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, who was found at a Ramada motel near the San Diego airport Tuesday after paramedics responded to a call for medical help. Lopez was briefly hospitalized with lacerations, then jailed on suspicion of Killgore's murder. Her relationship to Killgore is still unclear. CNN affiliate KGTV in San Diego reported that authorities found Killgore's body based on leads stemming from Lopez's arrest. Investigators later found Killgore's body in a rural part of neighboring Riverside County. Authorities have not said how she died. Perez, who is based at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County, pleaded not guilty to a weapons and stolen property charge Wednesday. The judge set bail at $500,000. ""We believe he knows more than what he initially told us,"" said Sheriff's Capt. Duncan Fraser. ""We do not believe he is being cooperative with us.""

"(CNN) -- A Burmese python slithering through the Everglades proved that her eyes weren't bigger than her stomach, swallowing intact a 76-pound deer. At 15.65 feet, the python isn't the largest on record. But the size of her prey both impresses and concerns state and federal wildlife scientists and land managers trying to control the non-native species. ""They are large exotic animals that are not naturally from this area,"" said Randy Smith, spokesperson for the South Florida Water Management District. ""The potential to wreak havoc on the natural Florida wildlife ... they don't have true enemies."" Contractors spraying exotic vegetation Thursday came across the female python on an island about 20 miles from Everglades National Park, Smith told CNN Tuesday. It was dispatched, by protocol, with a single shotgun blast to the head. A necropsy conducted by Everglades National Park wildlife biologists showed the python had a girth of 44.1 inches after devouring the adult female deer. The snake normally weighed 139 pounds. Officials Tuesday said they are trying to determine the age and health of the deer. ""We see them on a regular basis,"" Smith said of pythons. ""We've dispatched hundreds of these in the past few years."" The menu for Burmese, rock and African pythons includes rodents, birds or smaller snakes. In 2005, a python apparently busted its gut after it had consumed a 6-foot alligator. Some of the snakes may have escaped enclosures after Hurricane Andrew's widespread destruction in 1992. But there's a more likely cause for the problem. ""Obviously, some of these were pets,"" Smith said. When people realize they are going to grow up to be much larger than they expected, they often release the creatures into the wild. That's the worst thing you can do, officials said. Management and park officials have tried trapping, but that's largely failed. Scientists and park managers are studying the exotic reptiles' breeding habits and pinpointing their locations to devise a strategy for controlling them. ""It's not meant to be successful in this habitat,"" Linda Friar, spokeswoman for Everglades National Park, said of the Burmese python. ""We don't have any idea how many there are. This is the biggest (one) we have ever dealt with."" The giant reptiles compete with alligators and crocodiles. Although pythons have been found in or near some residential areas west of Miami, there have been no reports of injuries to people, Smith said. Friar said invasive fish species, such as walking catfish and lionfish, are an even bigger problem in southern Florida. CNN's John Branch contributed to this report.","Python nearly 16 feet long devours deer whole .

"(WIRED) -- When Microsoft revealed the ""consumer preview"" of Windows 8 on Wednesday, it didn't just give the world a glimpse at a new OS — it also showed us that it can be a leader in touch-based user interface design. Yes, Microsoft's new tablet UI isn't merely utilitarian. It's actually innovative, and even cool. And in some ways it trumps the best that Apple and Google currently have to offer in iOS and Android, respectively. Here are five of our favorite new Windows 8 features. Picture password . We've known about Microsoft's picture password feature in Windows 8 since its developer preview was unleashed in mid-September. But now that we've had a chance to give it a spin, we can definitely say it's a fun, convenient alternative to other system unlocking methods. In a nutshell, you choose a photo for your lock screen, and then define three touch gestures to draw on top of the photo in order to unlock your device. When Microsoft first detailed picture password, some were skeptical: Won't evil hackers be able to figure out your gesture-based password based on the smudges you leave on the display? In a blog post, Microsoft said no: ""Because the order of gestures, their direction and location all matter, it makes the prospect of guessing the correct gesture set based on smudging very difficult even in the completely clean screen case, let alone on a screen that sees regular touch use."" In that same blog post, Microsoft provided a detailed mathematical explanation of why a picture-based password is every bit as secure, if not more so, than a PIN-based one. And independent security experts agree that the likelihood of someone being able to decipher the intent of smudges on your device is slim to none. Of course, character-based passwords and number-based PINs are an old standby. Apple uses four-number passcodes in iOS. They're quite secure, but not particularly innovative. Google is more creative with its unlock security, offering a facial recognition-based unlocking feature in its Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich OS. This, however, has proven not to be so secure. In fact, it can be defeated if you hold up a picture of the Android device owner at the right distance from the display. Easy gesture-based app switching . In the Ice Cream Sandwich version of Android, Google has added a ""Recent Apps"" feature that pulls up a listing of most frequently used apps when you click the system bar icon. But in Windows 8, switching between open apps is much more intuitive and easy: A swipe from the left edge of the device will immediately pull up the last app you used (assuming it's still open in a multitasking state). It's a natural gesture, and one you'll rarely use by accident. And best of all, it's fast — like channel surfing for the tablet era. And how's this for clever: If you know you have a large number of apps open, you can simply swipe back and forth on the edge of the screen, and up pops a vertical array of preview windows revealing all your running programs (see screenshot above). From here, you can tap on a preview to jump to a specific app. Again: another solution that's easy, quick and elegant. In the iPad version of iOS 5, you're given two strategies to jump between apps. Most people will double-tap the home button to reveal a lineup of icons of all open apps. From there, a simple icon tap will jump to the new app. That's the popular method. But iOS 5 for iPad also lets you swipe from open app to open app, much like the method in Windows 8. But there is one hitch in the iOS approach: You have to use a full four fingers to execute the swipe. Compared to the Windows 8 gesture, it's just not that natural. Fat fingers aren't a problem . One problem many mobile users suffer is that onscreen keyboards aren't designed for a variety of hand and finger sizes. This is typically less of a problem on tablets, which usually have enough screen real estate to offer accommodating keyboards. Nonetheless, if you plan on using your tablet two-handed, typing with your thumbs, typing on a tablet isn't so easy. Windows 8 offers a solution: It provides a split-screen keyboard so you can type with your thumbs. But wait, you say — Apple already does this in iOS 5. This is true, but Windows 8 goes one step further: You can adjust key size in the Windows 8 split-screen keyboard. You have three sizes to choose from, so if you've got the petite hands of a five-year-old, you can type on the small setting, and if you've got manly man hands, you can increase key size to large. It's not an insanely revolutionary feature, but little UI nuances like this make Windows 8 so appealing in total. Chromeless, fullscreen app experiences . Windows 8 also innovates with a unique, tablet-optimized approach that eliminates distracting ""chrome"" — in other words, all those busy interface elements that can junk up a desktop or app interface. In fact, it's an OS-wide theme of Windows 8′s Metro UI. There are no menu bars, task bars, or navigational buttons permanently pinned to the display. In many iOS apps, you'll find navigational buttons that persist across the app's entire user experience. And even for apps that don't do this, you'll often still see that thin bar at the top of the screen that shows data connection strength, the time, and battery level. These are the very same elements that are locked to the iOS home screen. The case is similar (and arguably worse) in Ice Cream Sandwich. You've got your three virtual navigation buttons at the bottom of the display that are persistent across the UI. You also often have a bar across the top of the screen (just like in iOS) that displays battery status, time, and icons that link to other information. Windows 8 does away with all of this. To see the time, battery strength and data connectivity, you swipe open your Charms menu. Once you're done looking at these simple reports, you touch anywhere on the screen, and the Charms menu disappears. When I was younger, I was obsessed with knowing the time, so the new Windows 8 approach would have driven me nuts. But now it's liberating to keep the clock out of view — until I actually need it. Just check the time when you need to, and enjoy a much less busy user interface for 99 percent of your time on the tablet. Metro apps can luxuriously take up your tablet's full screen, and in cases where there's photo or video involved, that's fantastic. Home screen style and utility . Every major mobile OS provides a certain degree of personalization in what you see in your home screen. In iOS, you can rearrange your home screen app icons so you can put your favorite ones front and center. In Android, you can organize the placement of app icons, and also add widgets that display real-time information, making the home screen both personalized and a source of useful information. However, Android widgets tend to have their own developer-specific themes and designs, so when they intermingle on your home screen, the resulting arrangement may look busy and inconsistent like a chaotic patchwork quilt. In Windows 8, however, you'll find a happy medium between the tidy organization that iOS provides, and the freedom and utility of the Android home screen. In Windows 8, app icons are live tiles, either square or rectangular in shape, but always consistent in their basic look and feel. But live tiles also update with new information in real time, just like an Android widget. For example, the mail app provides a constant refresh of your latest message headers. You can organize live tiles in whatever order suits you best. In the screenshot above, we put the calendar, mail and weather apps on the far left so we could glean that information with a single downward glance. See the original article on WIRED .

"(CNN) -- An architect who uses recycled building materials from historic buildings torn down to make way for China's megacities has won architecture's most prestigious international award, the 2012 Pritzker Architecture Prize. Wang Shu, 48, whose Hangzhou-based firm Amateur Architecture Studio has just four permanent staff, was widely regarded as a long shot to win the $100,000 prize that has previously been awarded to celebrity architects such as Norman Foster and Frank Gehry. ""The fact that an architect from China has been selected by the jury to win the prize, represents a significant step in acknowledging the role that China will play in the development of architectural ideals,"" said Thomas J. Pritzker, chairman of the Hyatt Foundation which sponsors the prize. Unlike many of his contemporaries who studied overseas in the United States and Europe, Wang trained in China. He took the unusual step of taking on almost no commissions during the 1990s, instead learning about building materials by working closely with the kind of craftsmen normally shunned by office-bound architects. ""For myself, being an artisan or a craftsman, is being an amateur or almost the same thing,"" Wang said in a press release, using the word in its true meaning as one who does something for love rather than money. One of his most celebrated buildings, the Ningbo Historic Museum, used recycled materials collected from the nearby area to construct a modern building that paid homage to the past. ""My belief is that architecture should work hand in hand with time,"" said Wang. ""Sometimes I prefer to use less costly materials that can be replaced when damaged. Temporary, as I use the word, is not meant to mean disposable."" He says the design process is similar to that of the traditional Chinese painter. He first studies the environment, looking at its orientation and geography. He then thinks about these things for a week without doing any designs. Then -- as was the case with the Ningbo Historic Museum -- the design begins to take shape in his mind. ""I design a house instead of a building,"" he said. ""One problem of professional architecture is that it thinks too much of a building. A house, which is close to our simple and daily life, is more fundamental than architecture."" The Pritzker judges praised Wang's ability to create architecture that is timeless, deeply rooted in its context and yet universal. One of the judges, Glenn Murcutt, a previous winner of the architecture prize, described Wang's work as ""mature,"" avoiding the ""sensational and the novel."" ""To look at the state of the profession, it would seem that anything is possible, and more often than not, we get anything!"" he said. Despite his growing reputation, Wang still has to struggle to gain acceptance for his idiosyncratic designs. The first step, he says, is to convince the government and the client, the second step is to marry the construction materials to the plan, and the third is to get those who will use the building to accept it. ""(This last step is) the hardest part of all, because the Chinese often think of a building as just a container whose functions can change at will,' He added. ""I can have no influence on this third stage.""","Wang Shu, 48, wins architecture's premier prize .

"(CNN) -- Manager Kenny Dalglish is determined to use Liverpool's first trophy win in six years as a catalyst for future success, following Sunday's dramatic penalty shootout win in the English League Cup final. The Scot, who is known as ""King Kenny"" by the club's fans after a title-laden career as both player and manager, has had a difficult time since returning to Anfield for a second stint as boss in January 2011. Mixed results on the pitch and controversy off it -- with the long-running Luis Suarez race row saga casting a shadow over the club's reputation -- have meant big challenges for the man guiding one of England's most successful teams. Liverpool failed to qualify for any European competition this season, and could have faced a similar prospect in 2012-13 if Sunday's match against second division Cardiff City had ended in defeat. However, the club's fans were celebrating after the 18-time English champions clinched their first silverware since winning the FA Cup in 2006. It was also the first success for Liverpool's American owners, the Fenway Sports Group, who took over in October 2010. The Wembley match finished 2-2 after extra-time, but a penalty miss from Cardiff's Anthony Gerrard -- cousin of Liverpool captain Steven -- gave the five-time European champions an eighth success in the competition. ""Our people are absolutely delighted with their first trophy in six years, so it's been a very good day for us,"" the Scot told reporters. ""We'll just continue to work hard and see where it takes us. Arsenal fight back to seal emphatic derby win . ""Although we've won something today, that's not us finished. We don't want to stop here -- we want to keep going. The best chance we have of doing that is to continue to do what we do best, and that's to stick together."" Dalglish was previously Liverpool manager between 1985 and 1991, guiding the club to three league titles and two English FA Cup wins. The 60-year-old now wants to prevent another long wait for silverware. ""The idea six years ago was not to go six years without winning a trophy! We've won it, we're going to really enjoy it and we know how much they (the fans) have really enjoyed it. It gives you a flavor to come back and do it again,"" he said. ""The only reason we're here is because every member of the squad has contributed to winning this trophy. If we all stick together and everybody makes a contribution, we give ourselves a better chance of success. ""We got here because we worked really hard to get here and because the players are good players."" Liverpool are battling to qualify for next season's European Champions League, a competition they have won most recently under Spanish manager Rafael Benitez in 2005. The seventh-placed Reds are seven points off England's fourth and final qualification place, held by Arsenal, but can reduce that deficit by beating the London side on Saturday following the midweek friendly internationals. Liverpool could yet claim a second trophy this season, with the club facing an FA Cup quarterfinal tie against Stoke City on March 18. Victory would earn a return to Wembley, with both semis to be played at the national stadium. ""We'll go back to work after the internationals and see if we can kick on from here,"" Dalglish said. ""I don't think anybody who has won a trophy has ever come away from it and said, 'I never enjoyed that.' If you get something you enjoy, you're going to want more of it.""","Kenny Dalglish says Liverpool's League Cup win can be a springboard for more trophies .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The opening of clothing retailer H&M's first store in China's capital was marked by the sight of hundreds of umbrellas clustered around its front doors. Senior management at H&M in Beijing open the retailer's first store in the Chinese capital. These were fearless shoppers, determined to get fist dibs on the new merchandise. It was a cold and rainy morning as salespeople opened dozens of new branded umbrellas and passed them out for free. Two women at the front of the line said they had been waiting since 6 a.m. The store didn't open for five more hours. ""We heard about it in Shanghai and did some research,"" one woman said. ""We checked its Web site and its new designs. We loved it."" Young, urban Chinese women who love Western brands are H&M's target market. ""I only buy foreign brands,"" said 22-year-old Xiao Xiao, who owns her own online fashion boutique. ""H&M offers a combination of fashion and cheap prices,"" another woman said. ""It's a brand that suits the public needs well."" This is a city hungry for the latest fashion and good deals. When the doors opened, the throngs flooded in, pawing the racks as if the clothes would disappear in a second. Xiao Xiao tripped and fell. The Beijing branch is H&M's tenth store in mainland China, after opening in Shanghai, Nanjing, Changzhou, Shenzhen and Wuxi. China is a crucial part of H&M's plan to grow its brand in Asia. ""Everybody knows China has 1.3 billion people,"" said country manager Lex Keijser. ""If we can bring in all these customers in the future to H&M, and dress them into our fashion, that will be great."" ""H&M is targeting young women from the age of 20-35,"" said marketing consultant Ray Ally. ""They're looking for a very kind of Western fashion. They want clothes they can't buy in China from local brands."" H&M is one of several Western companies seeking to expand in China, especially in light of bad sales back home due to the economic crisis. They're hoping to cash in on young professional women who want to be their own person, create their own style and have the money to do it. ""Women tend to spend more on brands,"" said Ally. ""They're more self-conscious, more aware of health and beauty issues."" Toy manufacturer Mattel recently opened a flagship store in Shanghai. It includes six glistening floors filled with not just Barbie dolls, but branded luxury goods aimed at young women who want to channel their inner ""Barbie girl."" Unilever-owned Dove is sponsoring the Chinese version of the TV Show ""Ugly Betty."" Episodes feature several seconds of fairly obvious product placement. And, Estee Lauder's Clinique is trying to reach China's 300 million netizens via the Internet with ""Sufei's Diary."" The digital sitcom profiles Sufei, a college student who deals with health and beauty issues. In one episode, she battles her pimples with Clinique's skin care cosmetics. This kind of non-traditional marketing is well-suited to Chinese consumers who spend many more hours online than watching television. Of course, it will take some time to see what the payoff is. ""Sufei's Diary"" is reportedly a hit. But China's ""Ugly Betty"" show hasn't won such a huge following. Some bloggers write that they don't think the main character is ""ugly enough."" As for H&M, its Beijing store is off to a good start. Minutes after opening, Xiao Xiao, now back on her feet, was already carrying piles of clothing. ""The blue suit, the pink shorts, the peacock clutch bag, I got them all,"" she said. ""I knew exactly what I wanted.""","Young, urban Chinese women who love western brands are H&M's target market .

"London (CNN) -- Two men have been sentenced to life in jail for the racist murder of a black teenager in London nearly 20 years after the offense. Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted for killing Stephen Lawrence in 1993 after a fresh trial based on new forensic evidence. It was a case that shook Britain and until Tuesday's verdict was one of the country's most high-profile unsolved murders. It also led to major changes in attitudes to racism, policing and the justice system. CNN examines key questions about why the case is so important. What happened to Stephen Lawrence? The 18-year-old student and his friend Duwayne Brooks were attacked at a bus stop in south-east London by a gang of youths. Brooks managed to escape but Lawrence was fatally stabbed. Jurors at the inquest into his death found that he was unlawfully killed in a ""completely unprovoked racist attack by five white youths."" What did the police do? The Lawrence family felt that London's Metropolitan Police failed to do enough to solve the crime, and expressed fears that racism within the police force might be a factor. They made a formal complaint about the police in 1997. The police later admitted there had been failures in the search for the killers and apologized to the Lawrence family, but the then-London police chief Paul Condon denied that the majority of police officers were racist. After the verdict on Tuesday, Lawrence's mother Doreen said the police involved in the original investigation had put her family through huge pain and uncertainty through their failure to investigate properly. ""This result shows that the police can do their job properly -- but only if they want to,"" she said. Although several suspects were identified, including Dobson and Norris, officials initially said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them. As a result, Lawrence's parents Doreen and Neville launched a private prosecution that eventually led to three suspects being acquitted. What was the reaction? Failure to solve the murder sparked widespread anger. The Lawrence family continued to campaign for justice -- and the Daily Mail, a UK tabloid newspaper, even went as far as accusing five men of the killing on its front page and invited them to sue if they were wrong. In 1997, four years after the murder, the then Home Secretary Jack Straw announced an inquiry into the crime. The resulting Macpherson report accused the police of ""institutional racism"" and found that detectives had made little effort to apprehend the white youths suspected of killing Lawrence. It also made a series of recommendations intended to stamp out racism and ensure police were properly trained on the issue. The report concluded that ""Stephen Lawrence's murder was simply and solely and unequivocally motivated by racism."" How were Dobson and Norris brought to trial? The Macpherson report also recommended that ""consideration should be given to permit prosecution after acquittal where fresh and viable evidence is presented."" A centuries-old practice known as the ""double jeopardy"" rule prevented someone already acquitted of a crime being tried again for the same offense even if there was fresh evidence. In 2005 the rule was abandoned, allowing the authorities to charge Dobson for Lawrence's murder if they could find new evidence, even though he had been previously cleared. In 2007 there was a breakthrough brought about by new technology. During the six-week trial, jurors were told of significant new forensic evidence recovered from clothing seized from the suspects' homes 18 years ago, including a very small blood stain on the collar of a jacket taken from Dobson's wardrobe. DNA testing showed the blood was that of Lawrence. Evidence was also found linking Norris to Lawrence's death. The new forensic evidence was the result of ""previously unavailable scientific technology and techniques,"" said Cressida Dick, acting deputy commissioner for the Metropolitan Police. The jury decided unanimously that Dobson and Norris were guilty of murder, rejecting defense arguments that the evidence was contaminated. Where does this leave race relations in the UK? The damning Macpherson report made 70 recommendations and called for an overhaul of the police to restore public confidence. The Metropolitan Police has since made widespread changes, and in a statement said it now had a ""better understanding of and relationship with London's communities leading to increased confidence and trust."" But it adds: ""We are not complacent and recognize there is still much more to do."" The UK government has also tightened laws requiring all public bodies, including the police, to treat everyone fairly and without discrimination. Despite this racism remains a concern. High-profile incidents have recently emerged in English football with two Premiership players being accused of making racist comments to rivals. U.S. civil rights activist Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN there was clearly a problem in the communities that ""incubated and protected"" those convicted of killing Lawrence. He also called on UK police forces to work harder at integrating black and white officers. ""Britain has an obligation to turn this crisis into an opportunity,"" he said. Are there any more suspects in the Lawrence case? The original inquest found that Lawrence was killed by five white youths. Police are still seeking evidence to pursue three other suspects. The Metropolitan Police acting deputy commissioner Cressida Dick said: ""We do of course acknowledge that there are five people involved in that murder. We have not brought all those people to justice."" She vowed to respond if there was new evidence.","Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed to death at a bus stop in London in 1993 .

"(CNN) -- In the age of the cell phone, in which every public space buzzes with the conversation of strangers, is it any surprise that a silent movie has captured the public imagination? On Tuesday ""The Artist,"" a silent movie about the transition to sound, was nominated for 10 Oscars. Alfred Hitchcock once said that the only problem with silent movies was that people's mouths moved and no sound came out. Today we face the opposite problem, inside and outside the movie theater: Sound comes out of people's mouths even when it shouldn't. To get a break from overhearing the incessant, unwanted talk that surrounds us is a valuable thing, and the box office and award-season success of ""The Artist"" proves it. The secret to ""The Artist""'s success goes beyond shutting off the surround-sound, however. The transition from silent cinema to the talkies, which was the greatest technological change in the movies before the digital era, came at a time of enormous economic devastation all around the world, a time very much like ours. The talkies were born in the late 1920s, as the stock market rose, but only triumphed during the Depression, after it crashed. Back then, movie theaters had to retool for sound amid economic uncertainty, just as they are doing today as they make the switch from film projection to digital. For film fans this is a melancholy change, just as the end of the silent era was for cinephiles then. The two great transitional films of their periods, ""The Jazz Singer"" in 1927 and ""Avatar"" in 2009, are linked by more than actors in face paint. Conceived during economic booms, both films ushered in new technologies that only fully emerged during economic crises. By setting ""The Artist"" in the Hollywood of the late 1920s and early 1930s, during a transition that was artistic, technological, and societal all at once, the film's director, Michel Hazanavicius, connects the film to our time. The key to the film's appeal is how lighthearted Hazanavicius keeps it. For him, the lost era of the silents was an innocent time, unmarred by the rape, murder, and suicide scandals other depictions of that period often exploit. ""The Artist,"" essentially a happy film, shows us that we can accommodate change and thrive. Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo,"" set in 1931, treats the same subject but reaches further back, to the birth of cinema. Its backward glance has been rewarded with one more Oscar nomination than ""The Artist,"" although ""Hugo"" has not done as well at the box office, in part because of an advertising campaign that was afraid to embrace its real values. Scorsese's ambitious film links the handmade, hand-painted, and hand-cranked movies the magician Georges Meliès made between 1896 and 1913 to the digital wizardry of films made today, 100 years later, especially to the Harry Potter films. ""Hugo,"" a beautiful and overwhelming phantasmagoria, chooses 3-D and color over ""The Artist""'s flat-screen black-and-white. Those choices inject the film with a layer of whimsical irony: Today's technology is contrasted with yesterday's. Scorsese uses the most sophisticated digital technology available to reconnect us to a cinema that was optical and mechanical -- glass and gears; hardware, not software. More and more, we put ourselves in the strange position of using technology to get away from technology. When we travel, smartphones connect us with places to find quiet and solitude, sometimes from within quiet cars on trains; when we shop, we browse computer screens for hand-sewn fashions and crafts. When we watch TV, high-def screens show us the natural world in never-seen-before detail, taking us to places we will never visit, including, recently, thermal volcanoes on the bottom of the ocean, where undreamed of species exist, looking uncannily like the papier-mâché creatures in Meliès' ""A Trip to the Moon."" The world is in our face, but untouchable. As digital imagery takes over the movies, filmmakers and audiences seek to reconnect to an analog, hands-on world, one in which machines are understandable and fixable. We want to see and feel how they work. High tech renders all the strings, smoke, and mirrors invisible; low tech exposes them, and by so doing presents magic as made by hand. We desire a less perfect world than the digitized one blockbuster movies have shown us, one where the scratches and seams are added as an aftereffect. ""The Artist"" and ""Hugo"" are both films of clocks, where time is running out or winding down or an alarm is about to go off. Two other impressive and unpredictably popular clock-centric films made in the past year also deal in the exhumation of the past: Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" (which got four Oscar nominations), in which Owen Wilson's Woody-stand-in goes back in time every night to live in the Paris of the 1920s; and Christian Marclay's monumental ""The Clock,"" an art-gallery film that was itself a timepiece, a 24-hour-long compilation of shots from other movies that shows the hands of clocks through every minute of the day. Recent books, like Simon Reynolds' ""Retromania: Pop Culture's Addiction to Its Own Past,"" take a despairing view of our current nostalgia, a longing that, say what you will, makes sense given the bleakness we face. Movies like ""The Artist,"" ""Hugo,"" ""Midnight in Paris"" and ""The Clock"" present a deeper view of the past than that. It is one in which our future is linked to the twilight of another time, which is paradoxically the era of F. W. Murnau's ""Sunrise,"" a silent film which still stands at the pinnacle of cinematic expression, and which came out a month before ""The Jazz Singer"" sang away an era. Do these movies smuggle the past into the future or just use it as pastiche? In an era where airports feature bizarre signs reading ""Snow globes are not allowed through the security checkpoint,"" these movies insist on the physicality of silent cinema, a memento mori in the age of the delete button.

"(CNN) -- It seemed like a harmless comment, or so Mario Almonte thought at the time. The year was 1992, and Bill Clinton had just appeared on ""The Arsenio Hall Show"" to play a rendition of ""Heartbreak Hotel"" on his saxophone. Almonte thought it was entertaining; his supervisor, on the other hand, thought the stunt ""demeaned the office of president of the United States,"" Almonte recalls. Almonte offered his opinion to his supervisor and that he ""relax."" It turned out to be the wrong choice of words, he said. ""He immediately got upset and started arguing with me, and for nearly half an hour, we kept arguing about the issue until we finally both walked away in disgust,"" said Almonte, a public relations specialist in New York who was not associated with the show or Clinton's campaign. ""For the next several weeks, every time he talked to me, he would throw in a jab at my opinion, and it would take all my willpower to keep myself from taking the bait."" The jabs eventually died down, but the damage was done, Almonte said. With that, he learned a lesson: never talk politics in the workplace. ""Most people are so passionately committed to their viewpoints that no discussion ever ends civilly, nobody wins, and nothing comes of it but a shouting match,"" he said. It may seem like common sense, but with the Republican primary season entering full swing, political discourse tends to spill over into the workplace. Among the rank and file, there's a chance that political discourse can work around the water cooler if you know your audience, human resource and etiquette experts say. ""Don't assume other people believe what you believe,"" said etiquette expert Anna Post with the Emily Post Institute. ""You don't choose who you work with, so it's really important that that relationship is a good one."" In other words, it's a risky gamble. If you can't keep it civil, or you're not sure the other person can, keep it to yourself, the experts agree. ""As we get closer to the election and the rhetoric gets even more heated, it's even more advisable to leave your politics at home,"" said Dean Debnam, CEO of Workplace Options, a workplace training benefits firm. ""You need to create an environment that feels comfortable and productive in every way to employees if you want to get the best out of them."" Most companies aren't likely to have a formal policy on the discussion of politics. But there are policies regulating against a hostile work environment, said Debnam, a North Carolina Democrat who also runs a polling organization. ""From the management point of view, there's a need to be mindful of not creating a hostile environment, and that includes being intolerant of direct reports' beliefs on politics or otherwise."" Some companies attract employees of a certain political persuasion, but that's usually clear coming in the door, he said. ""If you're going to take a job with the Catholic Church, you know what they're about,"" he said. ""But to come into something that's supposed to be neutral and then feel pressure to take a certain position that you don't want to, that's not OK."" If you're dying to discuss last night's debate, avoid judgmental language and focus on facts over feelings, Post said. ""You want to keep this as undebatable as possible,"" Post said. ""You also need to be wiling to swallow the last word, be able to agree to disagree and be willing to bow out before it escalates."" Now a manager at another company, Almonte, the New York-based public relations specialist, prefers to avoid the topic of politics altogether. ""I don't get involved, and I do discourage it,"" he said. ""With politics and sports, it seems like there's rarely a middle ground to be reached. And that's not good for business.""","With Republican primaries under way, politics becomes water cooler talk .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday praised Congress' decision to extend the payroll tax cut while also pushing legislators to enact the rest of what the administration characterizes as its economic support plan for the middle class. The president declared he is prepared to move ahead with his domestic agenda whenever possible with or without congressional support -- a message with clear political overtones in the current election season. ""For a typical middle class family, (the payroll tax cut) is a big deal,"" Obama said. ""Now my message to Congress is don't stop here. Keep going. ... This may be an election year, but the American people have no patience for gridlock (and) reflexive partisanship."" Obama outlined a number of proposals believed to have little or no chance of winning approval among Republicans on Capitol Hill, most notably the so-called ""Buffett Rule"" designed to ensure people earning more than $1 million annually pay at least a 30% tax rate. ""Wherever we have an opportunity, we're going to take steps on our own,"" the president said. ""We've got a choice right now. We can either settle for a country where a few people are doing very well and everybody else is having to just struggle to get by, or we can build an economy where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody's doing their fair share and everybody is taking responsibility."" The White House believes Republicans are more willing to make deals in the wake of a bruising fight over raising the debt limit last year, according to a senior administration official. Political analysts, however, note that even if Obama's proposals fail to pass Congress, the president can draw a clear distinction between himself and his Republican opponents. Some analysts have speculated Obama is also laying the groundwork for a possible reprise of Harry Truman's successful 1948 campaign against a so-called ""do-nothing"" Congress. At the moment, however, Democrats are taking a victory lap for the extension of the payroll tax cut. The roughly $100 billion measure, a key part of Obama's economic recovery plan, has reduced how much 160 million American workers pay into Social Security on their first $110,100 in wages. Instead of paying 6.2% had it lapsed, they'll be paying 4.2%, a break worth about $83 a month for someone making $50,000 a year. The measure, which passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate last Friday, also extends unemployment benefits and avoids a Medicare fee cut for doctors for the rest of the year. Obama has promised to sign the bill into law when it hits his desk this week. The payroll tax issue proved problematic for Republicans, who were caught between competing goals of providing the tax cut and paying for it. GOP leaders this month acknowledged they angered voters by initially raising objections to the unpaid tax cut extension.","Obama celebrates payroll tax cut, urges Congress to pass other domestic initiatives .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The last time I talked to Anthony Shadid, I made him promise not to become another headline. He didn't keep his promise. I learned through a headline -- along with the rest of the world -- of his death in Syria, apparently of an asthma attack. Don't become a headline. It seems trite now. It was meant as a light exchange with him, after he and three other New York Times journalists were released from captivity in Libya. I had just watched him and the others in a CNN interview on AC360 with Anderson Cooper, detailing their harrowing captivity at the hands of Moammar Gadhafi's forces. And, at the time, it seemed like a good thing to say. New York Times reporter dies in Syria . I never believed it would be one of the last conversations I would have with Anthony, who early in my career had been my mentor and my editor and later my colleague and, I like to think, my friend. I am struggling with the news of his death and with the knowledge that I will never get to have another conversation. The news stories about his death spell out the extraordinary career that took him from California to New York, from Cairo to Baghdad, from Tripoli to Beirut. They tell how he worked for the Associated Press, The Boston Globe, The Washington Post and, finally, The New York Times. They tell of the two Pulitzer Prizes he won in 2004 and 2010 for his reporting from Iraq. They even detail his willingness to stand up to an editor to fight for his story. As a journalist, I know that stories are not supposed to be personal. They are supposed to be about the facts. But the fact is the death of Anthony Shadid is personal. The first time I met him was in the Associated Press newsroom in Los Angeles. I already knew him by name, from his byline. He had just moved from Cairo, Egypt, and was to be my news editor. That day, over a cup of coffee, he asked me about stories and subject matter that I found fascinating. He asked what I wanted out of my career, where I wanted to go with it. Neither of us had any idea at the time where our paths would lead, or that we would find ourselves years later standing together at a party in Baghdad talking about career paths. That day, in Los Angeles, it was a conversation about how to tell better stories. I wanted to be better, and he promised to help me. Anthony told me about the stories he loved writing, reading and editing. They were stories about people and their conditions. And the best stories, he told me, were full of color and context. Those stories, he said, make a difference. When I asked him for an example, something I could read to better understand, he gave me a list of journalists whose work I should follow. What I remember most: His name was not on the list. During his tenure in Los Angeles, he kept his word and worked with me. Once, after a harried editing session, I asked him if he missed being a reporter. ""Every day,"" he said. In May 2000, the news that Reuters correspondent Kurt Schork and AP cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno de Mora were killed in an ambush in Sierra Leone sent shock waves through the industry. Anthony knew Kurt and Miguel. He was angry, upset they had put themselves in harm's way. At least that's how I remember his reaction, and I remember being confused by it. Wasn't that their job? Wasn't that sometimes part of the risk? Today, I understand his reaction. It was the same one I had when I found out that he had he died. When Anthony took a reporting job at The Boston Globe, he called to tell me of the pending announcement that he was leaving the Associated Press. I asked why he wanted to leave, though I already knew: Anthony was a reporter, a storyteller. He made his first headline in 2002, when he was shot in the back of the shoulder while leaving Yasser Arafat's compound in Ramallah. When the news broke, my colleagues tracked down a phone number for him in a hospital in the region. I was surprised that he answered the phone himself. He was in good spirits, and he laughed over the fact that so many people had managed to track him down half way around the world. ""Does everybody know where I am?"" he said. The answer: Dude, you're the headline. During that conversation, I reminded him of our discussion two years earlier about Kurt and Miguel. You remember that? he said, sounding surprised. Over the years, Anthony and I managed to stay in touch sporadically through e-mails. Like many people, I followed his reports from Iraq during the early days of the war. It was his stories about the Iraqi people that gave me the truest sense of what life was like for the millions caught up in the war. When I got the opportunity to go to Baghdad in 2008 to cover what would become the beginning of the end of U.S. involvement in Iraq, I sent Anthony an e-mail to let him know. He wrote back, warning me to be careful and not to take too many risks. He also told me to tell great stories. When I got off the plane at Baghdad International Airport, among the items I carried with me was Anthony's book ""Night Draws Near: Iraq's People in the Shadow of America's War."" Not long ago, unpacking boxes after moving to Atlanta to take a job with CNN, I stumbled onto a picture of Anthony. It was taken in December 2009 at a Christmas party in Baghdad that the Reuters news agency hosted. He was smiling, with his arm around his pregnant wife. She had made the trip with him from their new home in Lebanon. He was beaming as he introduced her, clearly enjoying this new chapter in his life. When it was revealed that the baby was due shortly before Iraq was to hold its elections for Parliament and prime minister, a story the world was following, I asked Anthony what he was going to do if the delivery was late. Overheard on CNN.com: Readers weigh in on Shadid . His wife, journalist Nada Bakri, answered for him: The baby will be on time. We spent hours that night catching up, recalling assignments, colleagues and developments in our lives. And we laughed. I found out later that the Anthony's wife gave birth to a son, Malik, about the same time as Anthony was making headlines again -- this time for winning his second Pulitzer Prize for international reporting. I last saw Anthony in Baghdad in 2010 at my goodbye party. I was wrapping up a 17-month assignment. It was a bittersweet moment. He asked me what was next. I told him I didn't know. Anthony gave me a throaty laugh, hugged me and said, ""Write well."" As the word spreads about his death, there will be many whose lives he influenced and, in some cases, forever changed, that will step forward. I am just one.","Journalist Anthony Shadid was a mentor, colleague and friend .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Italian search-and-rescue teams have found another body aboard the partly sunken cruise ship Costa Concordia, civil protection office spokeswoman Francesca Maffini said Sunday. The woman is the 13th confirmed victim of the wreck on January 13. Divers are working to recover the body, which was found underwater on bridge number 7, Maffini said. The victim was wearing a life jacket, she said. The discovery leaves about 19 people still missing since the ship hit rocks in the shallow waters off the coast of Tuscany, according to CNN count. A 12th body was found within the ship Saturday afternoon, according to Italian authorities. The body of a woman wearing a life jacket was discovered in an area of the ship that was under water, Maffini said. A committee comprising the parties involved in the rescue told a briefing for reporters and residents on the island that search and rescue efforts will continue -- but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent. Officials said they cannot predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage, since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties, but all legal, environmental and human factors will be taken into account. ""It's time for Italy to show it can do something right and do it well,"" said Franco Gabrielli. Gabrielli, who leads Italy's civil protection agency, warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting, not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin, using special cameras and divers. The giant Costa Concordia had 1,500 cabins on board. Gabrielli said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship -- only kitchen and engine oil -- and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping. A plan to remove the fuel oil has been approved, he said, and will begin once experts give the go-ahead. Booms have been put in place around the ship to stop the spread of oil and other pollutants such as detergents and sewage chemicals. With 4,000 people aboard, the ship was the size of a small town, Gabrielli said. Fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship's tanks to keep the ship balanced, said Adm. Ilarione Dell'Anna, head of coastal authorities for the port city of Livorno. Gabrielli said Costa Cruises, the company that owns the cruise ship is cooperative and was proving responsible, despite past errors. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. An audio recording obtained by Italy's Repubblica newspaper and published Saturday shows that the captain, at least at the outset of the incident, assured authorities he would do the right thing. According to the recording, an Italian Coast Guard official asks Schettino how many people needed to be evacuated to the top of the ship to be rescued on life boats. ""About two of three hundred people still,"" the captain says. The Coast Guard asks -- will everyone evacuate, or will someone stay behind? ""I will stay here,"" Schettino answers, saying that he believed that the boat was done leaning over. Other audio recordings previously released, however, indicate that Schettino did not stay on board, but left the ship, to the anger of authorities. The office of prosecutor Francesco Verusio said it would lodge an appeal against the investigating judge's decision to grant the captain house arrest. Verusio has said he that the captain should be in jail given the flight risk, and the gravity of his crimes. Schettino's lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, spoke to Italian news channel Sky Tg24 on Friday, urging people to reserve judgment on the captain until they have all the facts. Schettino's leadership has been repeatedly questioned. Earlier this week, a cook from the ship told a Filipino television station that the captain ordered dinner for himself and a woman at about 10:30 p.m. -- less than an hour after the collision. However, a Moldovan woman, Domnica Cemortan, 25, who also works for the cruise line but said she was on the Concordia as a passenger, defended the captain in a TV interview. ""I've heard in Russian media that the captain left the ship first, or among the first. But this is not true,"" she said. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members. The vast majority fled the ship safely. CNN's Dan Rivers, Livia Borghese, Hada Messia, Marilia Brocchetto and journalist Barbie Nadeau contributed to this report.","NEW: The body of a woman is found, still wearing a life jacket, authorities say .

"Port Victoria, Seychelles (CNN) -- The cruise ship Costa Allegra, disabled two days ago by an engine room fire, is due to arrive in the Seychelles Thursday, Costa Cruises said Wednesday. Passengers and crew will be put on planes and sent home almost immediately, the Indian Ocean nation's tourism chief said. Costa Cruises said it had secured 600 plane tickets and 400 hotel rooms. There are more than 1,000 people on the Allegra. With power out, they are using mineral water for washing, Costa said. They have a supply of cold food including fruit, cheese and cold cuts, and fresh bread is being flown to the ship by helicopter, the company said. A large French fishing ship began towing the liner to port on Tuesday. A Seychelles Coast Guard ship reached the Costa Allegra later in the day, along with two tugboats from the Seychelles Ports Authority, said Seychelles presidential spokeswoman Srdjana Janosevic. The ship was being escorted to Port Victoria, the Seychelles capital, she said. The Allegra lost power in the Indian Ocean Monday with 636 passengers on board and a crew of 413, according to Costa Cruises. Most of the passengers are from Europe, but eight are from the United States and 13 are from Canada. Costa initially said Tuesday the ship was expected to arrive Wednesday at the Seychelles island of Desroches, but said later that after ""extensive and accurate checks,"" passengers could not get off on Desroches. The ship is instead being towed to the Seychelles island of Mahe, where Port Victoria is located, the cruise line said. ""The disembarkation in Desroches does not assure the necessary and adequate security conditions for mooring the ship and guests' disembarkation,"" the cruise line said in a statement. ""In addition, logistics and hotels on the island are not enough; it would require an immediate transfer from Desroches to Mahe through ferries."" The ship departed from Diego Suarez, Madagascar, on Saturday and was originally scheduled to arrive in the Seychelles Tuesday. The Allegra is a fleet mate of the Costa Concordia, which wrecked off the coast of Italy on January 13, killing at least 21 people. CNN's Zain Verjee, Vladimir Duthiers and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","The Costa Allegra is being towed and should arrive Thursday, its owner says .

"(CNN) -- The Egyptian Football Association (EFA) have confirmed that the 2011-2012 Egyptian Premier League season has been called off. The league was suspended early last month, after the deaths of over 70 fans in riots that occurred during the match between al-Ahly and al-Masry in Port Said. And the EFA have now confirmed the league will be replaced by a separate tournament that will be held from March 29th to May 18th. Spokesman Azmy Megahed told the Confederation of African Football (CAF) website that there was not enough time to play all the remaining fixtures, before the national team started training for the London Olympic Games and the 2013 African Cup of Nations qualifiers. The new competition will be called the ""Martyrs Cup"", which will feature 18 teams with matches being played behind closed doors with no spectators present. However, al-Masry, whose supporters have been blamed for the riots last month, have not been invited to play in the tournament, the draw for which will take place on March 21. The format of the competition will see teams divided into two groups of nine, with every team playing the other in their section. The top two teams of each group will then qualify for the semifinals, the winners of which will play in the cup final.","This season's Egyptian Premier League has been officially canceled by the Egypt FA .

"(CNN) -- U.S. and North Korean officials are meeting Wednesday in Beijing to settle the details of a plan to allow the resumption of food aid to the North. The talks take place against a backdrop of bellicose images and rhetoric from Pyongyang. North Korean television this week aired footage of a military unit carrying out live-fire drills in sight of a South Korean island. Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, is holding talks with representatives from Pyongyang on Wednesday to ""finalize all of the technical arrangements so that the nutritional assistance can begin to move,"" according to the U.S. State Department. North Korea last week announced an agreement to freeze its nuclear and missile tests, along with uranium enrichment programs, and allow the return of U.N. nuclear inspectors. The United States said it would provide 240,000 metric tons of nutritional assistance to the impoverished country. GPS: The price of negotiating with North Korea . The United States had suspended shipments of food aid to North Korea in 2009 amid tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear program and concerns that the supplies were not reaching those most in need. The deal last week to resume the deliveries came after the the two countries revived negotiations that had stalled after the death in December of the longtime North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. The talks Wednesday will focus on issues such as what ports will be used to dock incoming ships, how the distribution of the food will be monitored and which nongovernmental organizations will be involved. The talks will be the final phase in implementing U.S. food aid, according to the State Department. The agreement was cautiously welcomed by U.S. officials in the hope that a new era in relations with the North would begin and lead to a resumption of multilateral talks aimed at the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. But Pyongyang has stepped up its rhetoric against the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, and his government since Kim Jong Un took over from his father, Kim Jong Il, as North Korean leader. The footage on North Korean television this week showed tanks repositioning and an artillery machine being prepared, overlooking waters that have seen a number of violent incidents over the years. North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island in November 2010, killing four South Koreans, claiming it was responding to a South Korean military drill in the area. Fiery rhetoric accompanied the military actions. Deputy commander Li Gum-chol said, ""We will turn Seoul into a sea of flames by our strong and cruel artillery firepower, which cannot be compared to our artillery shelling on Yeonpyeong Island. We are training hard, concentrating on revenge to shock Lee Myung-bak's traitorous group and the military warmongers in South Korea."" The United States and South Korea are carrying out annual joint military drills, which North Korea has condemned as a provocation. Now, Pyongyang is staging its own. CNN's Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.","North Korea last week announced a freeze on nuclear and missile tests .

"(CNN) -- Roberto Mancini and Andre Villas-Boas have had sharply contrasting fortunes this season, but both managers celebrated vital victories in the English Premier League on Saturday. Mancini's Manchester City moved five points clear at the top of the table with a 3-0 victory over struggling Blackburn, putting the pressure on second-placed champions Manchester United to match that result at Norwich on Sunday. Villas-Boas' short reign at Chelsea has come under increasing scrutiny after the worst run of results since billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2004, but a similar three-goal win at another relegation-threatened team, Bolton, moved his side back into the top four. City suffered a relative lull in form in January with key players injured, suspended and away on international duty, but this month has brought three league wins and a two-leg double over Europa League champions Porto of Portugal to reach the last 16 of the continent's second-tier competition. Mario Balotelli, back from a four-match domestic ban, opened the scoring at home to Blackburn after half an hour with a delightful near-post finish from fullback Aleksandar Kolarov's left-wing cross. The eccentric Italy striker celebrated his 10th league goal this season by displaying his latest undershirt -- his previous one asked ""Why always me?"" but this one spoke of his love for girlfriend Rafaella. Strike partner Sergio Aguero doubled the lead seven minutes after halftime with his 16th league score, pouncing after Blackburn keeper Paul Robinson failed to deal with a corner from David Silva, who was also involved in the first goal. With Edin Dzeko coming off the bench to head home his 13th in the EPL from Kolarov's 80th-minute cross, it means Carlos Tevez may have to wait to make a meaningful contribution to City's bid for a first league title since 1968. The former City captain ended his three-month exile last week and apologized for his absence without leave, but is lacking match fitness. Chelsea's form this month has left Villas-Boas having to deal with a reported player revolt and constant questions about his future. However, the Blues bounced back from the Champions League defeat at Napoli on Tuesday to earn a first victory in six games in all competitions. Center-back David Luiz struggled again in his usual defensive duties in Italy, but showed his undoubted attacking flair as he opened the scoring against Bolton just after halftime with a curling effort. Striker Didier Drogba doubled the lead after the hour and midfielder Frank Lampard celebrated his return to the starting line-up with the third with 11 minutes left. Lampard, whose European omission along with other key players prompted Abramovich to interrogate Villas-Boas about his tactics, made the veteran England international the first player to reach double figures in the Premier League nine seasons in a row. It was also his 150th in the EPL. The win put Chelsea above Arsenal into the fourth Champions League qualification place, putting even more pressure on the struggling Gunners ahead of Sunday's north London derby at home to third-placed Tottenham. ""The most important thing about this weekend is going to be Arsenal-Tottenham tomorrow and to see in which way you benefit from it,"" Villas-Boas said. ""You can either benefit from it with Tottenham coming closer to us or we finish in fifth again and 'drama' all week!"" Newcastle could have moved above Arsenal but blew a two-goal lead against lowly Wolverhampton Wanderers, who earned a vital point in caretaker manager Terry Connor's first match in charge. Connor has replaced the sacked Mick McCarthy until the end of this season, becoming the only black manager in charge of an EPL side this season. New signing Papisse Cisse scored his second goal for Newcastle and Jonas Gutierrez made it 2-0 inside 20 minutes. But winger Matt Jarvis pulled one back five minutes after the break and striker Kevin Doyle's 66th-minute leveler moved Wolves a point above the relegation zone. Newcastle joined Arsenal on 43 points -- 20 behind Manchester City. West Brom moved up to 12th after thrashing ninth-placed Sunderland 4-0, while Wigan stayed bottom after a 0-0 draw at home to Aston Villa -- whose striker Darren Bent will miss England's friendly against the Netherlands next week after injuring his ankle. Queens Park Rangers were above the bottom three on goal difference only following the 1-0 defeat by west London rivals Fulham, who moved up to 11th after January arrival Pavel Pogrebnyak scored his second goal for the club. QPR debutant Samba Diakite was then marched for his second yellow card, becoming the team's third first-half sending-off in four home matches.","Manchester City extend English Premier League lead to five points on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- India blew Bangladesh away with a strong display in the field, wrapping up a 113-run victory over the hosts on the final day of the first Test in Chittagong. Ishant Sharma gave India early breakthroughs in the morning, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan chipped in with vital wickets and Amit Mishra completed a four-wicket haul as India cantered to victory with a session to spare. Mushfiqur Rahim delayed the end with a stroke-filled 101 after opener Tamim Iqbal bolstered the innings with 52, but the home side -- 67 for two at the start of play -- were bowled out for 301. A diligent approach was required of the home side if they were to save the game, but instead their batsmen played into India's hands with an aggressive approach. But that attacking intent was nipped in the bud when batsman Mohammad Ashraful attempted to drive Ishant on the up, only for an edge to be neatly snapped up by Rahul Dravid at second slip. Victory for India then seemed a foregone conclusion when Raqibul Hasan, who suffered a painful rap on the elbow, was trapped in front by Ishant with a delivery that nipped in. Tamim helped Bangladesh recover somewhat from those early blows, the opener hammering a wayward Shanthakumaran Sreesanth for two boundaries in one over and reaching his third Test half-century with a reverse sweep of Mishra. But Sehwag brought himself on just before the lunch interval and struck in his second over, luring Tamim into a wild slash and inducing the edge, Dravid completing the dismissal with a sharp catch at slip. Shakib Al Hasan was Mishra's first victim of the day and Mahmudullah went shortly after, losing out to Zaheer. Shahadat Hossain and Mushfiqur held up the end with a 60-run stand for the eighth wicket, but Mishra ended that stand, boring through Shahadat's defensives and bowling him through the gate. Mishra should have had another wicket but Yuvraj dropped a simple catch from Shafiul Islam, extending the tailenders stay. But that reprieve hardly proved costly as Mishra held a low return catch from Shafiul in the next over to send back the batsman. The home side had slipped to 258 for nine by then and the session was extended and the tea interval delayed. With an attacking field in place, runs were there for the taking and Mushfiqur cashed in, reaching his maiden century with a straight-driven boundary off Mishra, his 17th boundary. He had already smashed a six by then and had reached the milestone off only 112 deliveries, the fastest-ever century by a Bangladesh batsman. Mishra, however, brought up victory by prising out Mushfiqur, the wicketkeeper-batsman lofting the bowler over the top, but only finding the fielder at long-off.","India blew Bangladesh away with a strong display in the field on the fifth day of the first Test match .

"London (CNN) -- Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, head of the 85 million-member worldwide Anglican Communion, announced Friday he will step down from his post at the end of the year. Williams has been archbishop of Canterbury, the top role in the Church of England, for 10 years. He has accepted the position of master of Magdalene College at Cambridge University, starting in January, a statement on his website said. Williams said: ""It has been an immense privilege to serve as archbishop of Canterbury over the past decade, and moving on has not been an easy decision."" He thanked those who had ""brought vision, hope and excitement"" to his ministry. He has informed Queen Elizabeth II of his decision, the archbishop's office said. As supreme governor of the Church of England, the queen will formally appoint his successor. The Crown Nominations Commission will consider who will follow Williams in the role ""in due course,"" his office said. The secretary-general of the Anglican Communion, Canon Kenneth Kearon, wrote to senior church leaders to announce Williams' resignation, the Anglican Communion News Service reports on its website. Williams' time in office has ""coincided with a period of turmoil, change and development in the Anglican Communion, and his careful leadership, deeply rooted in spirituality and theology, has strengthened and inspired us all in the Communion during this time,"" Kearon is quoted as saying. The issues of homosexuality and women bishops have caused public tension and deep division within the Anglican Communion during Williams' tenure. Although Williams came out against gay marriage, speaking of the dangers -- as he called them -- of ""imposing"" this on the rest of the population, he is generally perceived to be a liberal and is credited with pushing through the ordination of women bishops, expected later this year, which had been a major controversy. The issue of gay rights has already riven the Anglican community in the United States and is anathema to most African Anglicans, the church's largest population. General Synod member Andrea Minichiello Williams, who heads the British group Christian Concern, urged the Church of England to ""move decisively"" to find a successor who would provide a clear voice on divisive topics. ""There are many issues confronting our nation at the moment, which have raised the question of the place of Christian faith in British society. This is, therefore, a crucial time for the established church in this country to provide leadership, clarity and direction as many people want,"" she said in a statement. Among those considered likely to take over from Williams is the Ugandan-born Archbishop of York, John Sentamu. He sought refuge from Idi Amin in the United Kingdom in the 1970s but still holds conservative values more recognizable to the African bishops, drawing fire most recently for accusing gay rights' activists of imposing a ""dictatorship"" of their values. The second-ranking figure in the Church of England, Sentamu is highly popular in the United Kingdom. He penned a column in the newly launched Sun on Sunday. In a statement on his website, he said he had heard the news of Williams' resignation with ""great sadness."" He paid tribute to Williams as ""a remarkable and gifted leader who has strengthened the bonds of affection."" And, reflecting the controversy that has surrounded Williams, Sentamu added: ""Despite his courageous, tireless and holy endeavour, he has been much maligned by people who should have known better."" Born in Wales in 1950, Williams studied theology at Cambridge and was an academic before going into the church. He became bishop of Monmouth in 1991 and was appointed the 104th archbishop of Canterbury in 2002. Millions around the world watched him celebrate the marriage of Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, last April. CNN's Nima Elbagir, Richard Allen Greene and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","NEW: Williams was ""a remarkable and gifted leader,"" says Archbishop of York .

"(CNN) -- Iraq is suddenly back at the top of the news. The drawdown of ""combat"" troops has been completed, the handover to the State Department looks shaky, violence is ticking up and there is still no new Iraqi government, more than five months after the March elections. All these are real, but they are only the most immediate manifestations of deeper and longer term issues that the United States will need to manage.  Our diplomats face big challenges. Let's start with the Iraqi government. Superficially, it looks as if former prime minister Ayad Allawi and present prime minister Nouri al-Maliki -- who came in first and second in the elections -- are in a huge personality clash.  Why can't one of them be a statesman and step aside? The answer is that both they and other Iraqi politicians are worried about whether this will be their last opportunity to gain power. The American troops have de facto guaranteed for the past seven years that some sort of broad, representative democracy would continue in Iraq.  But if the troops all leave by the end of 2011, as currently agreed, who will guarantee the political system?  Who will prevent a drift back to autocracy, or even a coup? The transfer of lead responsibility from American troops to diplomats has done little so far to answer these questions.  This is a big diplomatic challenge:  to find ways to convince politicians in a country that has known little other than violent political change that their next political choice will be made at the ballot box. This is an even bigger challenge in Iraq than elsewhere because of sensitivities about national sovereignty.  Bosnians and Kosovars (not to mention Haitians and many others) have welcomed both foreign troops and civilians deployed to their territory to maintain their newly minted democracies.  Iraqis, while complaining that the foreign troops have made a mess and failed to clean it up, wanted the Americans out. The State Department needs to focus on finding ways to guarantee whatever solution the Iraqis work out. Should it be ""term limits"" for al-Maliki, as outgoing Ambassador Chris Hill has suggested?  A political pact that would allow al-Maliki to remain for two years and then be replaced by Allawi?  An agreed reduction in the prime minister's powers, particularly his control over the armed forces? Someone outside the Iraqi political context is going to have to seal the deal with a commitment to make sure it is implemented.  The most obvious vehicle for this is a new U.N. Security Council resolution, but getting one is complicated by the fact that Iraq wants an existing Security Council resolution lifted. Sounds like a classic diplomatic challenge. Another option is the Strategic Framework Agreement, a bilateral commitment to continued U.S. cooperation with Iraq that the Iraqis sought and continue to think important.  Fully implemented, it would be little short of an alliance relationship with Iraq, one that would encourage foreign investment and open up economic, educational and cultural opportunities for Iraqis. Washington needs to convince the Iraqis that full implementation of the agreement depends on the continued existence of a broad-based democratic regime in Baghdad.  That also sounds like a classic diplomatic challenge. So, too, does another underlying issue: the Kurdish/Arab dispute along a lengthy confrontation line in northern Iraq, where the Kurdistan Regional Government and its Peshmerga military forces claim territory that lies beyond the territory Iraqi Kurdistan controlled during the Saddam Hussein period. U.S. military forces have been proactive in building confidence between the Peshmerga and the Iraqi Army and ensuring that they do not come to blows.  Who will take on this role once the U.S. forces withdraw? The diplomats face many other challenges: They are going to be responsible for training the Iraqi police, they are going to have to protect themselves as they move about the country, they need to do much more to get European and other friends and allies engaged in Iraq, they need to help Iraq regain its regional role and settle its relations with the neighbors. Some in Congress are asking, why do the State Department and USAID need $9 billion for Iraq next year?  The better question is this: How much should we spend to protect an investment of over $700 billion that we have made over the past seven years? The war is over, sort of, but the peace-building will go on for a long time.  Peace-building is expensive, but a lot cheaper than war. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Serwer.","As U.S. combat troops leave Iraq, diplomats face challenge of building peace, says Daniel Serwer .

"Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- Polls closed Sunday in Senegal where citizens voted in an election overshadowed by violence as protesters demand the elderly president refrain from seeking another term. President Abdoulaye Wade, 85, was booed and jeered when he cast his ballot at a polling station in the middle-class neighborhood of Point E. He did not address the crowd, looked visibly frustrated at one point, and made some sort of gesture to the crowd, which also included some of his supporters. If a candidate does not win 50% of the vote, a runoff election will be held next month in the West African nation. ""We've had enough of this regime of thieves and assassins. We will defeat them here,"" said Cheikh Gassama, a voter at the Point E station. As the president arrived, he and other chanted ""Na Dem,"" which means ""step down"" in Senegal's predominant Wolof language. Senegal is one of the continent's most stable democracies. Past elections have included a smooth transition of power, a rarity in a region with a history of election chaos, civil wars and coups. Turnout on Sunday was low, according to Thijs Berman, chief observer of the European Union monitoring mission. ""Early in the morning, you saw long queues of people in front of polling stations but, later in the day, there were much less people and it seems that the turnout is below 50%,"" he said. ""There was high political tension before these elections, so it is surprising that so few people came to vote."" Wade is seeking re-election despite deadly demonstrations after the country's highest court cleared him to seek a third term. Protests have occurred in Senegal since the Constitutional Council's January 27 ruling. Opposition demonstrators argue that the court was compromised and the constitution limits presidents to two terms. The incumbent successfully argued that he is exempt because he took office before the term limit was put in place. The president, who has been in office since 2000, was once hailed as a visionary, but his popularity has plummeted. ""Wade built schools, roads and hospitals,"" said Ayo Johnson, an analyst on African affairs. ""His leadership has now failed. ... There are increasing levels of poverty, inequality, lack of jobs and an increasing numbers of disillusioned youth."" Wade ran against 13 other candidates on Sunday's ballot. ""Senegal is at a crossroad. A people whose patience has run out, a leader who's out of touch, a constitution not reflective of popular sentiments and an opposition that is unable to put aside party differences with a common purpose to defeat Wade,"" Johnson said. Protesters calling for his ouster have clashed on the streets, with at least three people killed during demonstrations last weekend, an opposition leader said. At least two others died in previous clashes. A presidential spokesman has accused opposition candidates and their supporters of fueling ""urban guerrilla warfare"" leading up to Sunday's vote. But Amath Dansokho, head of the opposition June 23 Movement, blamed police for the escalating violence, saying they were responsible for some deaths during demonstrations in Dakar and Rufisque this month. The presidential spokesman denied the police or military were involved in the deaths. The opposition June 23 Movement, or M23, is named after the date of protests last summer that forced Wade to withdraw a constitutional amendment that would have nearly guaranteed his victory in this month's election. West Africa has a history of political strife, but Senegal has largely maintained peace and has never experienced a military coup.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea fired several short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan on Saturday, an act that the U.S. watched closely and South Korea called provocative. N. Korean army soldiers, back, look at a S. Korean soldier, center, in the demilitarized zone in June. Pyongyang fired seven short-range missiles in less than seven hours, South Korea's Foreign Ministry said. The missiles were apparently Scud-type, estimated to have a range of about 500 kilometers (310 miles), according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. South Korean intelligence estimates that North Korea has about 700 such missiles in its arsenal. Pyongyang test-fired four such missiles off the east coast Thursday, Yonhap reported. South Korea called the launches a provocative act, according to a government statement. North Korea had issued a warning to mariners to avoid an area in the Sea of Japan at certain times between June 24 and July 9 because of a ""military firing exercise,"" according to a U.S. military communication about the warning provided to CNN. The recent firings come amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula. North Korea conducted a nuclear test in May, fired test rockets and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters.  Watch S. Korea confirm firing of missiles » . The first two missiles were fired about 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., Yonhap reported. Another missile was launched about 10:45 a.m., the agency reported. A fourth one came some time after that. The U.S. Navy and other U.S. officials said they are ready to track any missiles. ""The United States is aware of possible missile launches by North Korea. We are closely monitoring North Korea's activities and intentions,"" a U.S. official said. ""This type of North Korea behavior is not helpful. What North Korea needs to do is fulfill its international obligations and commitments."" Earlier this week analyst Daniel Pinkston said the reported test might be training for a future test but it could also just be a routine military exercise. ""It is worrisome to some degree, but it is different from a ballistic missile launch,"" said Pinkston, of the International Crisis Group in Seoul, South Korea. ""It's part of military training, but there seem to be no movements of troops or anything that would suggest preparations for military operations. ""So yes, people are watching it, the military is watching it here, but I don't think it's related to any plans or operations to attack anyone.""

"(CNN) -- There's a whole world of people out there, and boy, are they pissed off. The anonymity of the Internet encourages online ranting, from election-season tirades to mockery of celebrities. On political blogs, the invective flies. Posters respond to the latest celebrity gossip with mockery or worse. Sports fans set up Web sites with names that begin with ""fire,"" hoping coaches, athletic directors and sportscasters lose their jobs. And though there are any number of bloggers and commenters who attempt to keep their postings and responses on a civil level, all too often interactive Web sites descend into ad hominem attacks, insults and plain old name-calling. Indeed, there are even whole sites devoted to venting, such as justrage.com (one screed there was titled, ""I don't give a flying f***, so f*** you"") and mybiggestcomplaint.com. This is not a world Emily Post would want to be caught in after dark. ""The Internet can be a great tool,"" said Sara Black, a professor of health studies at St. Joseph's University who takes a particular interest in online bullying. ""Like any tool, it can also be misused.""  See examples of Internet anger » . One reason for the vitriol that emerges on the Web, experts say, is the anonymity the Internet provides. Commenters seldom use their real names, and even if they do, the chance for retaliation is slim. ""In the [pre-Internet era], you had to take ownership [of your remarks]. Now there's a perception of anonymity,"" said Lesley Withers, a professor of communication at Central Michigan University. ""People think what they say won't have repercussions, and they don't think they have to soften their comments."" Contrast that with a face-to-face conversation, or even a phone conversation, where you can judge people's moods from facial movements or vocal inflections, observes University of Texas psychology professor Art Markman. iReport.com: Second Life avatars grapple with reduced nonverbal communication . ""It's hard to be aggressive when you're face to face,"" he said. Moreover, he points out, aggression often carries a subtext of power. ""A lot of times, real anger is an attempt to get control over a situation where the person doesn't usually have it,"" he said. In that respect, comments to blog posts are attempts to strike back. Those power games are innately grasped by children and teens, with schools serving as a perennial social laboratory. Cheryl Dellasega, a Penn State women's studies professor, ticks off hypothetical examples that could have come straight from the scripts to ""Mean Girls"" or ""Heathers."" ""Girls who are getting teased come home and let their [aggressors] have it by putting something on their blog and starting a rumor campaign,"" she said. And instead of rumors simply making the rounds among peer groups -- which can be bad enough -- ""they go out to a much bigger group, a worldwide group. The impact is devastating, and it's as easy as clicking a button."" ""Kids don't realize that one post can destroy somebody's life forever,"" she added. Indeed, such incidents have made headlines. In 2006, 13-year-old Megan Meier committed suicide after becoming attracted to a boy on MySpace who then turned on her. The boy turned out to be a hoax created by a neighbor family that included a former friend of Meier's. In August, The New York Times Magazine did a story about trolls, some barely out of their teens, who antagonize others for the sake of ""lulz"": ""Lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2,000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh,"" one ex-troll told the publication. Adults aren't immune by any means. A Japanese woman, angry at her online ""husband,"" killed his avatar after he divorced her. A South Korean actress committed suicide after being harassed by online rumors following a divorce. Celebrity gossip sites are full of snarky comments about stars; reaction from readers is often brutal, turning the story into the online equivalent of a pile-on. Markman is quick to observe that he doesn't believe there's more anger out there. But, he said, ""there are more ways of expressing it on the Internet."" ""We've all had interactions with unpleasant people, but we don't confront them. We take it out elsewhere,"" he said. ""What the Internet has created is groups of people where there are no repercussions with being too aggressive."" Indeed, though electronically transmitted anger has parallels throughout human history -- the bitter letter, the village gossip -- the speed at which it travels, and the number of people who may come in contact with it, is something new, says St. Joseph's Black. ""[Electronic] media can increase potential for violence in a number of ways,"" she said in an e-mail interview. ""First, it introduces ideas (good and bad) that people may not have come up with on their own. Second, it is easier to depersonalize the victim, facilitating perpetration. Third, aggressive behaviors may be reinforced with points, attention or status, especially in games."" Withers has seen that first hand. She teaches a course on the ""dark side of communication"" at Central Michigan, involving ""the mean or evil things we do on a day-to-day basis,"" as she describes it: cheating, for example, or lying. As part of the course, several of her students work on a collaborative project with students at other schools, and they come together in Second Life, the virtual reality environment. If someone isn't pulling his or her weight, says Withers, others can be harsh in their judgments -- harsher than in real life, because the anger is expressed at the person's avatar. Sidebar: Dealing with anger in Second Life . Which led at least one of Withers' students to forget that the avatar was attached to a real person. ""One student went off on another student and she was sitting in the classroom a few rows behind him,"" she said. ""He knew she was there, but didn't -- there was that distancing."" iReport.com: Residents of virtual worlds deal with drama, stress . Is there a way to restore civility to the Internet? Among children and teenagers, say Dellasega and Black, it's up to parents to exercise control. ""I think parents need to take responsibility,"" Dellasega said. ""They give kids computers and leave them alone. ... When a child is 8 or 9, the computer should be in a public place. Kids should understand that using a computer is a privilege, not a right."" Schools can also play a role, she says. Black adds that parents should set clear rules on behavior and build empathy in their kids by having them reach out to those who are different. As for adults, human nature dictates that people will always lash out at others, whether it's over a perceived insult or simply because of a power differential. Web sites may ban the worst offenders, but they'll almost always pop up elsewhere, using a different name, e-mail address or even computer. ""Some people are just bitter and angry,"" said psychiatrist Dr. Terry Eagan, medical director of the Moonview Sanctuary in Santa Monica, California. ""Sometimes, they're against everyone, other times against a specific group. That person can get really stimulated and can say all sorts of horrible things. But I don't think it's not like they didn't exist before."" Whether the problem will get control of us, or we will get control of the problem, is in the way we face up to it, he says. Anger, he says, is rolled up with anxiety and fear, and nothing creates more fear like a lack of understanding. ""I tell patients that I'd rather know everything about people; information is powerful,"" he said. ""When the climate of the world is more fear-based, it permeates everything.""","Blogs, commenters and whole Web sites are full of vitriol .

"Washington (CNN) -- Could tractor-trailer rigs almost as long as Boeing 737s be driving on a highway near you? If a new transportation bill proposed by House Republicans passes, the answer is yes, and the safety ramifications would be astronomical, say congressional opponents of the bill and the AAA Auto Club. The American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act introduced Tuesday by Republicans would authorize about $260 billion over five years to fund federal highway programs. The legislation also contains a controversial provision allowing heavier tractor-trailer trucks on highways by increasing the federal weight limit from 80,000 pounds to 97,000 pounds. In some cases, it would allow 126,000-pound trucks onto highways. The legislation also allows the largest rigs, which comprise two and sometimes three trailers, to be as much as 10 feet longer -- a total length of more than 100 feet. While statistics from 2010 show overall traffic fatalities declining across the nation, truck crash fatalities actually increased 9%, to 3,675, according to statistics from the Truck Safety Coalition. Opponents of the proposed legislation say having even bigger trucks on the roads would increase the amount of fatalities because bigger trucks take longer to stop and their crashes are even more destructive. ""If there was ever a recipe for disaster, this is it,"" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Surface Transportation. ""We all value the importance of trucks to our economy, to our recovery ... but the trucks have to share the roads with our families, and that's why we're never going to let trucks take a priority over the well-being of our families."" But the Coalition for Transportation Productivity, a transportation advocacy group, says heavier trucks don't create safety issues so long as states make sure to require the trucks to have a sixth axle. ""The truck weight provision in the bill simply gives states the ability to open all, or portions of, their interstate networks to more productive, single-trailer trucks equipped with six axles rather than the typical five. Without changing truck size, the required sixth axle maintains all braking and handling characteristics at the new limit of 97,000 pounds,"" John Runyan, executive director of the coalition said in a written statement. Besides safety issues, opponents also say bigger trucks would put further stress on already deteriorating roads and bridges. ""At a time when we are seriously under-investing in the nation's transportation infrastructure, allowing bigger and heavier trucks on our roads and bridges is a step in the wrong direction,"" said Jill Ingrassia, AAA managing director of government relations and traffic safety advocacy. The bill is heading for a hearing in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Thursday, and Rep. James McGovern, D-Massachusetts, a member of the committee, said he will use everything in his power, including working with the Senate and the Obama administration, to get this provision taken out of the bill. ""I feel confident we're going to prevail here, but we're here to tell the leadership of the House that we're raring for a fight here,"" McGovern said. ""We are going to fight. This is a serious issue.""","A proposed transportation bill would allow heavier and longer trucks on highways .

Now, at least 10,000 years later, visitors in Los Angeles can see the remains of ""Zed,"" a Columbian mammoth whose nearly intact skeleton is part of what is being described as a key find by paleontologists at Los Angeles' George C. Page Museum. Zed was discovered at a construction site in the heart of Los Angeles. An earth mover helping to build an underground parking garage near the L.A. County Museum of Art uncovered the mammoth's skull, according to project director Christopher Shaw. ""The skull was hit and shaved off ... by a scraper,"" Shaw told CNN Thursday. ""We don't know just how smashed up it is, but it's fairly intact because it's a huge jacket we put it around."" The mammoth's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists ""tree-boxed"" along with the surrounding dirt, creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact. Zed's remains were encased in a plaster jacket. The construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the La Brea tar pits -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones. Construction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the Page Museum, who began analyzing the various fossils in June, Shaw said. ""It's very exciting for us because each one of these ... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years,"" Shaw said. John Harris, the head curator of the Page Museum, publicly announced the finding of ""a whole new treasure trove of fossils"" on Wednesday. He described it as ""the most important discovery"" for the museum ""of the last 90 years."" Shaw said the announcement was made to ""create interest"" in the museum's discovery. Among the most interesting items is likely to be Zed, who is believed to have died in his late 40s. Mammoths are thought to have had an average lifespan of about 60 years. Not all of Zed's remains have been cleaned off and analyzed. ""Right now we have opened the plaster jacket of four sections that were excavated, including vertebrae and ribs and pelvis, one tusk and the lower jaw,"" Shaw said. ""It will take another six to 12 months to open everything."" Shaw said both of Zed's tusks were found intact, which is very rare. ""Previously, we've found mammoths but the tusk material was very poorly preserved,"" Shaw said. ""It's very exciting to us to have these two complete, beautifully preserved tusks."" The excitement generated by Zed and the rest of the paleontological find could help boost the Page Museum's attendance and funding, which is key as many museums are seeing their attendance dry up during the recession. ""The cleaning of Zed can be viewed inside the museum inside the 'fishbowl' -- a windowed area -- as parts of his bones are being cleaned,"" Shaw said. ""So people come to see us and we've constructed small exhibits. It will attract a lot of people and that will help our funding situation."" Researchers hope to have the entire skeleton on display by next year. Shaw said it is unique to have such a major fossil find in the heart of an urban center like Los Angeles. ""I've always said we're kind of spoiled here in Rancho La Brea,"" he said. ""It's not like going to the Gobi Desert where you can't take a shower for weeks."" While the process of cleaning and analyzing the fossils is very intricate and time consuming, Shaw said it is a rare experience for researchers to come in to work and not know what they will discover that day. ""Every day we come to work, we're uncovering things that haven't seen the light of day for 40,000 years,"" he said. ""It's an exciting thing that we're doing just that.""","Nearly intact skeleton of mammoth found at Los Angeles construction site .

"(CNN) -- Montana's chief federal judge has offered his apologies for forwarding a racist e-mail aimed at President Barack Obama. Liberal advocacy groups demanded that U.S. District Judge Richard Cebull resign. Cebull, in an interview Wednesday with the Billings Gazette newspaper, offered his regrets for forwarding the e-mail, saying it was ""a hard lesson to learn."" ""To say it's inappropriate and stupid is an extreme understatement,"" Cebull said in courthouse chambers on Wednesday, according to the newspaper. ""There is no doubt it's racist. It wasn't forwarded for that purpose. If anything, it was political."" The Billings-based judge was named to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2001. He has been chief judge since 2008, overseeing two other full-time district judges, three senior or part-time judges and five magistrates. His chambers did not return a call from CNN for comment. Cebull did not write the offensive material, but admitted forwarding the February 20 message to a few friends after it was sent to him by his brother. The Great Falls Tribune newspaper was given a copy and reported the message went: . ""Normally I don't send or forward a lot of these, but even by my standards, it was a bit touching. I want all of my friends to feel what I felt when I read this. Hope it touches your heart like it did mine. ""A little boy said to his mother, 'Mommy, how come I'm black and you're white?' His mother replied, 'Don't even go there Barack! From what I can remember about that party, you're lucky you don't bark!'"" Obama is of mixed race. Cebull said in the interview his conduct in court over many years has shown he is not a racist, but he admitted the public got that impression from the e-mail. ""And I don't blame them,"" he added. The judge also separately told the Great Falls Tribune, ""The only reason I can explain it to you is I am not a fan of our president, but this goes beyond not being a fan. I didn't send it as racist, although that's what it is. I sent it out because it's anti-Obama."" Some legal organizations said the apology was not enough. ""If he has any respect for his office and for ideals of equality and human dignity on which our country was founded, Judge Cebull will step down today,"" said Bob Edgar, president and CEO of the left-leaning nonprofit Common Cause. ""The message he has acknowledged circulating demonstrates a lack of judicial temperament that ought to disqualify him from further service."" It's rare and generally very difficult to force federal judges from office. They receive tenure, and the Constitution guarantees they can remain on the bench ""during good behavior."" Standards warranting removal are not clear, beyond a violation of civil or criminal law. Congress would have to initiate impeachment proceedings, but the few judges to face that have usually resigned before those proceedings went far. There is no indication the judge in Montana would be subjected to either option.","District Judge Richard Cebull calls action ""inappropriate and stupid""

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Television stations in Baghdad are calling it ""Iraq Day,"" the Saturday deadline for American troops to completely withdraw from the country under a U.S.-Iraqi security pact. Stations aligned with Sunni and Shiite extremist groups, many of whom attacked U.S. troops, have dubbed it the ""Day of Defeating the Occupier"" -- others have called it the ""Day of Fullfillment"" or ""Day of Evacuation."" It's a day many Iraqis say they have waited for since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, even as they admit their country is mired in a political crisis that has raised fears of a return of sectarian violence that nearly tore the country apart at the height of the war. ""Iraq Day, we are all for Iraq,"" Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said in a mass text message sent Saturday morning. ""I congratulate you and our Iraqi nation on this great historic day, my love and respect to you and your families, your brother Nuri al-Maliki."" The celebrations in Iraq come nearly two weeks after the last convoy of U.S. troops crossed into Kuwait, ending an almost nine year war that saw more than 4,400 American military personnel and an estimated 115,000 Iraqis killed. Under a security agreement signed in 2008, the United States agreed to withdraw its troops by the end of 2011. Negotiations to extend the deadline broke down in October after Baghdad's political leaders refused to grant U.S. troops immunity from Iraqi prosecution, a move that Washington leaders said was unacceptable. Outside a Sunni mosque in northern Baghdad's Adhamiya district, a place where Sunnis and Shiites once battled one another and American troops, hundreds of men and boys gathered to listen to religious leaders who asked them to vow to preserve Iraq's independence. One banner read: ""This is the start of our spring."" The crowd outside the mosque chanted ""American cowards"" and ""Sunnis and Shiites will remain united in this country no matter what happens."" But these celebrations come amid reports of near daily violence that continues to plague the country and a political crisis that has Iraq's fragile power-sharing government teetering on the brink of collapse. On Saturday, gunmen attacked a checkpoint manned by anti-al Qaeda fighters in Diyala province. At least six fighters were shot in the town of Khan Ban Saad, southwest of the provincial capital of Baquba, a police spokesman said. Iraq's Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish political leaders have square off in recent weeks over a warrant issued for the arrest of Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who is accused of organizing his security detail into a death squad that targeted government and military officials. The arrest warrant was issued shortly after al-Hashimi's Sunni-backed Iraqiya party announced it would boycott Parliament, saying al-Maliki was cutting it out of the decision-making process. Al-Hashimi has denied the charges, saying the accusations are politically motivated amid the rivalry between his political bloc and al-Maliki's Shiite majority bloc. Al-Maliki has demanded that Kurdish lawmakers hand over the Sunni vice president, who has denied the charges and refuses to return to Baghdad from northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. The situation has been further inflamed this week with a political bloc loyal to radical, anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr calling for the dissolution of parliament and early elections. There was little mention of the withdrawal deadline in the United States, where weeks earlier President Barack Obama welcomed home some of the last U.S. troops. Rather, the focus in Washington has been on pending arms sales to Iraq and concerns about its political stability. ""As you know, our main focus has been in trying to encourage the Iraqi political groups to talk to each other and to create a broad national dialogue about the way forward,"" Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters Friday. ""With regard to the arms sales, these, as you know, are long planned and they're part of the transition process for the Iraqis to manage their own security within their own resources."" There are questions, though, about the actions of Iraq's security forces. Human Rights Watch, in recent months, has reported that Iraqi security forces have beaten and detained anti-government demonstrators protesting corruption and demanding more political freedoms. Udey al-Zaidi, the brother of Iraqi journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi who threw his shoes at then-President George W. Bush during a 2008 news conference in Baghdad, said Saturday he was detained a day earlier at an anti-American protest. By telephone from a Baghdad police station, al-Zaidi told CNN that he and a younger brother had been held overnight. ""If I could do it all over again, I would,"" he said. Al-Zaidi was among a small group of less than a dozen protesters who gathered Friday to mark ""Iraq Day"" in Baghdad's Firdous Square -- the place where Saddam's statue was toppled in one of the most iconic moments of the invasion in 2003. Al-Zaidi said they planned to burn the American flag at 2:15 p.m. -- the exact time he says U.S. troops raised the flag in the square in April of 2003. Iraqi security forces swarmed the square shortly after the protest began, and ordered the group to disperse because they did not have a permit. A CNN crew present at the protest was banned from filming despite having a permit to film in Baghdad. An Iraqi TV crew also present had their two cameras confiscated. When security forces moved to quash the protest, the younger al-Zaidi brother, Dhirgham, standing on the pedestal where Saddam's statue once stood, lit the American flag on fire. Udey al-Zaida, the protest organizer, was then beaten. A source familiar with the case told CNN a policeman hit al-Zaidi after he ""provoked the policeman."" The source said commanders at the scene stopped the policeman, but the CNN team, repeatedly asked to leave, saw policemen surrounding al-Zaidi as he was beaten. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. Both al-Zaidi brothers were held at a Baghdad police station over night, according to the source, because a complaint was filed against them by local police. The brothers told CNN Saturday that they were eventually released. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Iraqis mark deadline of U.S. troop withdrawal .

"Grosseto, Italy (CNN) -- The captain of the Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia ""committed a tragic error,"" but his crew did their best to evacuate the ship's 3,200 passengers, the last survivor found aboard said Wednesday. Manrico Giampedroni, one of the ship's officers, said he was on the darkened bridge with Capt. Francesco Schettino when the Concordia hit the rocks off the Mediterranean island of Giglio the night of January 13. He broke a leg as the liner rolled and was found 36 hours later in a half-flooded dining room, suffering from hypothermia. ""All of the members of the crew did their best. They made a good job, everybody,"" he told CNN before his release from the hospital. But, he said, Schettino ""committed a tragic error. Maybe he was too confident in his skills, and he relied too much on his knowledge of the ship."" At least 17 people died when the Concordia ran aground and settled sideways on the sea bottom off Giglio, with half of the vessel still sticking out of the shallow water. Another 15 remained unaccounted for more than two weeks after the accident. Giampedroni was the ship's purser, the officer in charge of passenger accommodations and food service. He also oversaw the evacuation that followed Concordia's grounding. Schettino had invited him to the bridge to watch as he steered the ship past Giglio in what the captain called ""a salute"" to the island town, Giampedroni told reporters on his way out of the hospital. About a half-dozen people were on the bridge, which was darkened for night operations. He said he thought the ship was passing too close to the island, ""but the captain drives the ship. He knows very well where he should pass."" ""In this occasion, we cannot say, 'Captain, we are too near the coast.' We cannot say that. In this case, it is best only to watch and nothing else."" Schettino has said that after the impact, he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking and limit its list. The captain is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still aboard. He denies the charges, saying his actions saved lives and dismissing prosecutors' suggestions that he was going too fast. Critics have also questioned whether Schettino waited too long to give the order to abandon ship. Giampedroni said that decision was up to the captain -- but once given, ""Everyone worked in the proper way."" ""Consider that the ship was leaning very fast, it was a little difficult for us to put the people in safe, on the life boats,"" he said. Most of the 3,000-plus passengers and the ship's crew of about 1,000 made it safely off the ship in less than two hours, he said. Giampedroni told CNN that he was hurt when he was heading back to the muster stations where passengers assembled to leave the ship. ""Muster station A was completely evacuated,"" he said. ""I wanted to check if there was anyone left on muster station B. When I was going there, in the restaurant, I had the accident. The ship was tilted, and it was easy to lose orientation."" Giampedroni was half-submerged in the chilly water flooding the restaurant when found. He said he survived by sipping at a soft drink that he caught as it floated by, since the contents had not been contaminated with salt water.","Manrico Giampedroni was on Concordia's bridge when the ship ran aground .

"Paris (CNN) -- Two French soldiers died and a third was critically injured after being shot by a black-clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in the southwestern French city of Montauban, the French Defense Ministry said Thursday. The defense ministry corrected its earlier report that all three soldiers had died. ""The last one is not dead, but he is in a very bad state,"" said ministry spokeswoman Natalie Neveu. The third soldier was hospitalized in Toulouse, she said. Two of the soldiers, aged 24 and 26, died at the scene of the shooting, officials said earlier. The three soldiers were at a commercial center when the man approached them, pulled a gun and started firing, city police commander Charles Cauquil told CNN. The police and army were seeking the shooter, who fled the scene after the attack. The three soldiers belonged to the 17th parachute regiment stationed in Montauban, a Defense Ministry spokesman said. The judiciary police in Toulouse were investigating the shooting, Cauquil said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The NBA's latest on-court sensation has appealed for space to be given to his relatives in Taiwan. New York Knicks star Jeremy Lin issued the request in a post-game interview after starring in his team's dramatic 104-97 win over defending NBA champions, the Dallas Mavericks. ""Obviously, I love my family, I love my relatives,"" Lin said. ""One special request I have is for the media back in Taiwan to kind of give them their space because they can't even go to work without being bombarded, and people following them. And so, I just want people to respect the privacy of my relatives in Taiwan. ... They need to live their lives as well."" The story of the Los Angeles-born star's rise from obscurity to sudden superstar has captivated Taiwan -- home to his grandmother and birthplace of Lin's parents -- and mainland China, which also claims to be his roots. There is even debate among his fans about who Lin should represent at the Olympic Games in London this summer. Read more about Jeremy 'Lin-demand' in China . Lin, whose name in Mandarin is ""Lin Shuhao,"" is the NBA's first U.S. player of Taiwan or Chinese descent. Not since Yao Ming, the now-retired Houston Rockets center and now owner of the Chinese Basketball Association's Shanghai Sharks, has a basketball player of Asian roots sparked so much interest. Lin's Sina Weibo account has nearly 2 million followers; on Twitter, he has about nearly 470,000 -- at last count. On February 13, as a hashtag with his name took over Twitter and New York amid a fourth consecutive win in his fourth start, Lin filed to trademark ""LINSANITY."" His filing wasn't the first; two other Californian men -- whose names aren't Lin; one is Slayton -- beat him by days. (By contrast just last month before his first start as a Knick, Lin had posted on Facebook, ""Everytime i (sic) try to get into Madison Square Garden, the security guards ask me if im a trainer LOL."") Sunday was a far different story: Lin was the Knicks' top scorer of the game with 28 points and a career-high 14 assists. The team took its eighth win in nine games and ended the Mavericks' six-game winning streak. The game also marked the Knicks debut for J.R. Smith, who scored 15 points in his first return to NBA action after playing for the Zhejiang Golden Bulls in the Chinese Basketball Association during the more than five-month NBA lockout. Although the lockout ended in December, Smith was cleared to play for the NBA only after his team ended its season. At the Sunday press conference, Lin also addressed the controversy surrounding three incidents of an ethnic slur by ESPN, which on Sunday fired an employee behind an offensive headline on its mobile website and suspended for 30 days an anchor who also used it. A third incident on Friday involved a radio commentator who is not an ESPN employee, the sports entertainment company said. ""I don't think it was on purpose,"" Lin said. ""At the same time, they've apologized. I don't care anymore.""","The U.S.-born star's rise from obscurity has captivated Taiwan, mainland China .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United have overtaken rivals Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table after a double from Wayne Rooney saw the champions defeat West Bromwich 2-0 on Sunday. Rooney's brace gives the defending champions a one point lead over rivals Manchester City, as Roberto Mancini's side surrendered top spot following a 1-0 defeat at Swansea. Both sides were playing on Sunday following disappointing Europa League defeats on Thursday at the hands of Athletic Bilbao and Sporting Lisbon respectively. United were outplayed in their 3-2 home defeat by Bilbao, but they put that performance behind them to brush aside a 10-man West Bromwich side in comfortable fashion. England striker Rooney made the breakthrough 10 minutes from half-time, diverting Javier Hernandez's cross past former United goalkeeper Ben Foster for his 23rd goal of the season. And United's stranglehold on the game became even stronger midway through the second half when the visitors had Swedish defender Jonas Olsson sent off for a second bookable offense. United made the three points safe in the 71st minute when Rooney scored from the penalty spot after Ashley Young had been brought down by Keith Andrews. Meanwhile, City, who lost 1-0 in Portugal three days previously, were always struggling against a Swansea side that are difficult to beat at home. And the hosts should have taken a sixth minute lead when they were awarded a penalty after Wayne Routledge was fouled by goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, Hart atoned for his error by diving to his right to keep out Scott Sinclair's weak spot-kick. But City's expensively-assembled side struggled throughout the 90 minutes and it was no surprise when they finally fell behind with seven minutes remaining. A mistake from defender Stefan Savic saw Routledge collect the ball, and he crossed for unmarked substitute Luke Moore to head home the winner. Those results see United overtake their neighbors to lead the table on 67 points, one ahead of City, with Tottenham a distant third another 13 points adrift. Meanwhile, Wigan Athletic remain bottom of the table despite recovering to earn a 1-1 draw at Norwich in Sunday's other match. Victor Moses netted a second half equalizer for the visitors and, although Wigan are still propping up the rest of the division, there are just four points between the bottom five teams.","Manchester United defeat West Bromwich 2-0 to go top of the English Premier League .

"(CNN) -- As Tropical Storm Washi washed over the southern Philippine island of Mindanao last December, heavy rains triggered deadly floods and landslides. More than 1,000 people died and at least 1,500 were injured, according to the Red Cross. The storm, locally called Typhoon Sendong, left tens of thousands homeless. 'Calamity' after Philippines storm . When iReporter Vince Avena from Quezon City, a Manila suburb, saw the destruction spread across the southern part of his country, he knew he had to act. He and a group of seven friends planned a trip to Mindanao for the first week of February so they could help in the effort to rebuild. They named it ""Operation VALENTINES."" iReport: Operation VALENTINES under way . Shortly after the group arrived in Cagayan de Oro, Avena shared his thoughts and hopes for the trip with CNN by e-mail in this Impact Q&A. CNN: Tell me about your trip. How did it start? Avena: A handful of iReporter friends of mine, along with myself, wanted to do something for the victims of Typhoon Sendong other than just writing or talking about it. We felt the need to at least do something to show the people that there are those who do care about their situation. We started to plan a quick trip to [Cagayan de Oro] a day before the new year. But it was not enough. We needed to do something more. Thus, a second trip was planned, this time over a month after the typhoon. That is because we figured that by that time (this February), the attention of the general public would have shifted elsewhere. The victims would have been just statistical data and forgotten. What better thing to do on the love month of February, than to do something that will show these people the love and concern we do have for them. To give them the ""Christmas"" they didn't get. To bring to them some joy and happiness. CNN: What are you doing? Avena: We each tried to gather things, relief goods from friends and relatives, even our own personal belongings that we felt would be useful. We coordinated with people in the area -- Cagayan de Oro and Iligan -- who would accompany us in our relief efforts. Personally, I gathered the elementary school books of my kids from grade one to six for all subjects which the people in Iligan can use to start a small library. I do have almost half a ton of clothes ready just in case the people would need clothes. We hope to go back to the area and see what else we can do for the people we've met if possible, to help them rebuild a schoolroom at least, and help them with their water supply as they have only one source of water for the entire barangay (or district). CNN: Why is this project important? Avena: For all the hazards and disasters that occur, be it natural or man-made, the children are the ones that suffer the most. They are the most vulnerable. Though not related to us in any way, even as total strangers, our hearts lead us to do something, anything, that can help lighten the load of these people. We may not be able to help everyone, but those that we can help by whatever means possible, then it is something worth doing. CNN: How are you making an impact? Avena: By creating awareness. By getting others involved. By giving a way by which people, ordinary people, can help others through our joint efforts. By planning what we want to accomplish, and following through on our promise. By starting to help -- one life, one community, one step at a time. CNN: Why should other people get involved? Avena: Life has got to be more than just working and having a good time. We have to stand for something. There is a time when we should just stop criticizing, stop staying on the sideline, stop being a spectator. It is about time that people get involved in what's happening around them. Rather than being a part of the problem, let us be key to the solution. What are you doing to Impact Your World? We want to hear about how you or someone you know is making a difference in the lives of others.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The Philippines said Wednesday that its largest naval vessel is engaged in a standoff with two Chinese maritime surveillance ships in a remote lagoon in the South China Sea. The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said the country's navy had sent the BRP Gregorio del Pilar, a 378-foot cutter, to the area of Scarborough Shoal on Sunday after surveillance aircraft spotted eight Chinese fishing boats anchored inside the lagoon. China and the Philippines both claim that Scarborough Shoal, about 200 kilometers west of the Philippine mainland, is ""an integral part"" of their territory. A boarding team from the Gregorio del Pilar went to inspect the Chinese fishing boats Tuesday morning and found ""large amounts of illegally collected corals, giant clams and live sharks"" inside one of the boats, the Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Later Tuesday, the Gregorio del Pilar reported that the two Chinese surveillance ships had arrived and taken up a position at the mouth of the lagoon, blocking the way to the fishing boats and ""preventing the arrest"" of the fishermen. The situation remained the same Wednesday morning, the Philippine statement said. The Philippine foreign minister, Albert Del Rosario, is seeking a ""diplomatic solution"" to the situation with China, the statement said. The Chinese Embassy in Manila has complained to the Philippine authorities about ""the harassment of Chinese fishermen,"" China's official news agency reported Wednesday. China has ""urged the Philippine side to stop immediately their illegal activities and leave the area,"" Xinhua reported, saying that the fishermen were taking shelter in the lagoon ""due to harsh weather conditions."" The embassy is ""still engaged in discussions with the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs to seek a solution"" and maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, Xinhua said. The South China Sea -- a 1.3 million square mile patch of the Pacific Ocean bracketed by China and several Southeast Asian nations -- is dotted with hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls that are home to some of the world's most diverse marine life. Also under its waves lie potentially huge reserves of natural gas and oil. That prospect has peppered the sea with competing claims from China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. It has also resulted in frequent small-scale clashes. Last year, a spate of incidents took place between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Brian Walker contributed to this report.","The Philippines sends a naval vessel to a lagoon in the South China Sea .

"(CNN) -- What started as the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York in September has spread across major cities worldwide as a call to action against unequal distribution of wealth. Thursday marked two months since the movement began. Here is a roundup of some of the movement's most recent developments, including several that resulted in arrests. NEW YORK . Protesters in New York launched what they called an effort to ""shut down Wall Street"" Thursday morning at the beginning of a nationwide day of what could be the Occupy movement's largest protests yet. A heavy police presence was in place as protesters kicked off the effort with the early morning demonstration against Wall Street. At least 245 people were arrested over the course of Thursday, police spokesmen said. That includes 64 arrested -- most all wearing ""99%"" T-shirts -- during a sit-in early in the evening on Centre Street, near Foley Square. Protests, police clash on ""day of action"" Five police officers were injured when a liquid was thrown on their faces during confrontations with with protesters, Kelly said. The officers felt burning in their faces, but were able to wash off the unknown substance at a nearby hospital. In addition, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said a 24-year-old police officer was injured when a star-shaped glass object was thrown at him. Speaking from Bellevue Hospital Center, he said ""some protesters today deliberately pursued violence,' but added that most were peaceful and have ""caused minimal disruptions to our city."" By Thursday evening, protesters had begun to stream from Manhattan across the Brooklyn Bridge. According to the Wall Street movement's Twitter feed, they chanted, ""This is what democracy looks like! This is what America look like."" The protesters walked along the pedestrian walkway, not the roadway -- as they'd done last month, when police more than 700 had been arrested. Around that same time, activists projected slogans onto one side of the 32-story Verizon building also in Lower Manhattan. Activists lifted metal barricades that ringed Zuccotti Park -- which had been the movement's original home base, prior to their conviction -- defying authorities and blocking traffic. Residents and employees of nearby businesses were required to flash identification cards as police cordoned off the surrounding area, police spokesman Paul Browne said. Protesters had said they want Thursday to be a day of nonviolent protest, although it comes a day after a demonstrator was arrested for making violent threats. Nkrumah Tinsley was arrested after being seen in a YouTube video making threats to use a Molotov cocktail on Macy's department store, New York police said. He also was seen in another part of the video threatening to ""burn down the city"" Thursday. About 200 people were arrested Wednesday, police said. LOS ANGELES . A total of 50 demonstrators were arrested Thursday in Los Angeles in two incidents -- one in the evening and another earlier in the day -- Los Angeles police spokesman Andrew Neiman said. Bail was set at $5,000 for those arrested, according to Neiman, and not $500 as previously reported by police. About 300 Occupy Los Angeles demonstrators marched about a half-mile early Thursday afternoon from their encampment near City Hall to a rally at the Wells Fargo Center. Several protesters were arrested, without incident, after blocking traffic on the corner of Figueroa and 4th streets -- an intersection that activists, on a website, earlier vowed to ""shut down"" -- according to witnesses. The march itself and subsequent protests seemed generally peaceful as people banged drums and shouted slogans. At the Wells Fargo Center, located in front of a Bank of America building, protesters chanted peacefully while Los Angeles police in riot gear watched nearby. PORTLAND, Oregon . A total of 48 people were arrested on three separate occasions in the Pacific Northwest city, police said, adding that they used pepper spray in one of the incidents. Twenty-five activists were arrested Thursday morning at the east end of the Steel Bridge, police Lt. Robert King said. All were cited for disorderly conduct. Also Thursday morning, nine others were arrested inside a Wells Fargo building and later charged with criminal trespassing, according to a press release from police. Then, Thursday evening, a large crowd of people were arrested at a Chase bank branch after they'd gone inside and refused to leave, Sgt. Pete Simpson told CNN. Some demonstrators were escorted outside, at which point a group blocked the street -- impeding a commuter rail line that runs down the roadway. Simpson said police used pepper spray to get individuals to move, after it ""became very tenuous at the front line, (and) there were a lot of people in the street."" The arrests were made both inside and outside the bank, the sergeant added. One Occupy Portland protesters was taken away by ambulance around 5 p.m., said King. His medical condition was unknown, though King said he believed he was conscious as he was being transported to an area hospital. LAS VEGAS . Police issued 21 misdemeanor citations Thursday morning after people sat down in the middle of Las Vegas Boulevard and refused to move,"" police officer Bill Cassell told CNN. He described the demonstrators as peaceful and said there were no injuries among police or civilians. SEATTLE . About 600 ""peaceful"" Occupy Seattle and union demonstrators marched Thursday across University Bridge in the northern section of the city, near the University of Washington campus, police spokesman Sean Whitcomb said. Whitcomb said early Thursday evening that there had been no arrests and no pepper spray had been used. Traffic was shut down in the area, during what was the evening rush-hour, he added. HOUSTON . Demonstrators from several groups, including unions and Occupy Houston, gathered around 4 p.m. in Market Square and then marched several blocks north, Houston police spokesman Kese Smith said. There, 12 individuals linked arms and sat down in the road -- a major route out of downtown and onto Interstate 45 -- and, after refusing police calls to move, were arrested, said Smith. All 12 were charged with obstructing a roadway, a misdemeanor. Another person who was on the sidewalk stepped forward and told a Houston police officer that she wanted to be arrested. After refusing repeated calls to stay on the sidewalk, this woman also was arrested, according to Smith. The vast majority of protesters exercised their First Amendment rights peacefully and without incident, the spokesman said. They will be booked and then arraigned at the Harris County jail. WASHINGTON . Several hundred protesters marched down M Street in the Georgetown section of Washington, then on the Francis Scott Key Bridge over the Potomac River into Arlington, Virginia. D.C. Metro Police, in squad cars and on horses, escorted the group. On the bridge, they were met by other demonstrators who had marched from the Virginia side. Together, they waved signs and chanted, ""Whose river? Our river."" ST. LOUIS . Dozens of protesters broke into a vacant municipal building in St. Louis and tried to hang a banner, according to CNN affiliate KPLR. They did so after about a dozen protesters were arrested during a march on a city bridge. CHICAGO . About 46 protesters were cited late Thursday afternoon after taking over Chicago's La Salle Street bridge over the Chicago River for 35 minutes, CNN affiliate WLS reported. No confrontations, meanwhile, were reported as several hundred demonstrators marched up and down La Salle Street between the Board of Trade and the Chicago River. DENVER . Denver District Attorney Mitchell Morrissey said Thursday that three activists have been charged with felonies -- including inciting a riot and second-degree assault on an officer -- in connection with recent Occupy Denver protests. Two were charged in connection to incidents that took place on Sunday, while one was charged related to an October 29 incident. ATLANTA . Six men and two women were arrested for blocking traffic Thursday afternoon in downtown Atlanta, police said in a press release. Atlanta police said those arrested ""did not comply"" after being given ""multiple warnings"" to move. They were charged with obstructing traffic. MIAMI . Led by a police car, dozens of demonstrators marched through Miami late Thursday afternoon, according to video footage from CNN affiliate WSVN. Many held up signs like one that read, ""Congress -- Good jobs, no cuts,"" as they walked. The Occupy Miami website said that the event would occur between 4 and 7 p.m., centered at Jose Marti Riverfront Park. DALLAS . Police evicted an Occupy encampment from City Hall property early Thursday, city officials said in a statement. Beginning at about midnight, ""police made several announcements, over a 90-minute period of time, via loudspeakers asking for demonstrators to leave,"" the statement said. Those that refused to leave were arrested shortly after 1:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET). Eighteen people were arrested, the statement said, and a crisis intervention team assisted seven people in obtaining shelter. COLUMBIA, South Carolina . Gov. Nikki Haley has encouraged demonstrators to return to the state Capitol on Thursday -- saying their signs and chants are welcome, but not their sleeping bags and mattresses, according to CNN affiliate WIS. In a press conference Wednesday, Haley said the Capitol grounds are for citizens' use during daylight hours only and should be respected. Law enforcement arrested dozens of protesters Wednesday. One protester told WIS ""We're calm, we're peaceful and we're not agitators."" Occupy events also took place Thursday in Boston, Milwaukee, Nashville and other cities around the country.

"(CNN) -- A 42-year-old immigrant from Rwanda, who is accused of lying her way into the United States after allegedly participating in the 1994 genocide that left up to 800,000 people dead, is going on trial in a New Hampshire federal court. Jury selection is set to begin Wednesday in the case of Beatrice Munyenyezi, who allegedly committed fraud in 1995 by denying her alleged involvement in mass rape, murder and kidnappings in Rwanda a year earlier. Prosecutors allege Munyenyezi, who is now a U.S. citizen, intentionally lied on a refugee questionnaire and naturalization documents about her role in the infamous slaughter, in which ethnic Hutu militants butchered their Tutsi counterparts over a three-month period. They say Munyenyezi, a Hutu, was a member of an extremist group associated with a paramilitary organization that set up roadblocks and targeted fleeing Tutsis and their sympathizers. One of the roadblocks was set up outside the Ihuriro Hotel -- an establishment owned by her husband's family, according to the indictment. The mother of three is allegedly married to former militia leader Arsene Shalom Ntahobali, who was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to life in prison last year. She allegedly lived in the hotel and helped pick out those who arrived at a nearby checkpoint to be executed and raped, the indictment said. She also is accused of stealing her victims' belongings. Her attorney, Mark Howard, said his client ""categorically denies that she committed any acts of genocide, or committed any crimes, as the prosecution alleges here."" Howard said that he has traveled to Rwanda to conduct interviews and acquire firsthand research in preparation for the case. Both sides are expected to a draw from a long witness list in Rwanda, including those currently incarcerated there. Authorities have appointed three translators to assist with the potential witnesses. If convicted, Munyenyezi could face deportation.","Jury selection is set to begin Wednesday in the case of Beatrice Munyenyezi .

"Indianapolis (CNN) -- Let's just come out and say what a lot of people are thinking this Super Bowl weekend: Indianapolis? Really? Hard-core fans who blow wads of cash every season to get their championship tickets punched want to know: Has the NFL reached a point when this iconic face-off between our national gladiators can be hosted by any team city? Even a cold-weather, landlocked, midsize burg surrounded by corn and guided by a mysterious force called ""Hoosier Hospitality""? Because, sorry sports fans, let's be real: This ain't New Orleans, Miami or Southern California -- or any of the sunshiny February playgrounds that have dominated location choices for 45 years. This is smack in the heart of ""flyover country,"" where many fans of the New England Patriots and New York Giants have never before dared to venture. You can picture them trying to locate the home of the Indianapolis Colts on a map, saying, ""It's in one of those 'I' states, like Iowa, Idaho or Illinois."" There's no need to mince words. Indy natives have heard it all before: ""Nap-town,"" ""India-no-place."" ""Hoosiers,"" as Indiana residents call themselves, are used to being underestimated, and they often take advantage of the benefits of low expectations. (Full disclosure: The author is an Indiana native, but, like many of his kind, he is unable to explain the origin of the word ""Hoosier."") After decades of strategizing, planning and selling the city to NFL team owners, Indy says it's ready to host Super Bowl XLVI. ""It's the pinnacle,"" said former Mayor Bill Hudnut, who started the campaign rolling in the early '80s. Without a doubt, preparations have transformed the town's look and feel. The community has poured hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and corporate coin to build new hotels, spruce up landscaping and resurface miles of streets. As a result, a sea of Patriots blue, Giants blue and Colts blue has been flowing through the downtown area -- now dubbed Super Bowl Village. More than 300,000 have walked through the neighborhood in the past week, officials said. Former Colts head coach Tony Dungy told CNN affiliate WRTV-TV that the city is putting ""its best foot forward."" The fans are ""going to be pleasantly surprised,"" he said. There's more to Indy than the Super Bowl . Restaurants, hotels and the village all surround Lucas Oil Stadium -- creating a compact, walkable Super Bowl district that veterans say is unique to almost all previous venues except perhaps New Orleans. ""I think the setup here is fantastic,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told WRTV. Streets have been renamed Raiders Road, Chiefs Avenue -- one for each NFL squad. ""Mike Epps and Snoop Dogg are coming in tonight!"" a fan shouted to a friend wearing a Giants jersey. Buildings are draped with majestic, gigantic multistory banners, and the street signs are adorned with the ubiquitous face of Madonna, the Super Bowl halftime headliner . Parlor games? ""Oh no, here we go,"" say local skeptics -- eyes rolling. ""This is the part where the media elite play that tired parlor game that comes up every time Indiana takes the national stage."" Does Indianapolis have to prove anything by hosting the game? Is this about some kind of cornfed inferiority complex that Hoosiers have been trying to shake for decades? ""We're not about that,"" said Dianna Boyce of Indianapolis' Super Bowl host committee. ""We let our actions speak louder than our words."" It's all a little shocking for those who remember what this neighborhood was like 30 years ago. There wasn't much here. For workers at the old brick-walled Hurst's HamBeens building on McCarty Street -- a stone's throw from the stadium -- there were no bars or nightspots for hanging out after quittin' time. ""You could count the number of restaurants on one hand,"" Boyce said. ""You just didn't come downtown to have fun back then."" In the old days, Indianapolis meant the ""brickyard"" -- the Indianapolis 500, said Tom Griswold, longtime co-host of the Indy-based syndicated radio program ""The Bob & Tom Show."" ""But after the arrival of Peyton Manning, now they say 'the Indianapolis Colts.' "" The image of Manning's face looms large on a building-size Papa John's banner in Super Bowl Village. Fourteen years after Manning joined the Colts, Americans are indeed talking about the $90 million quarterback. Specifically, they're talking about his neck. Manning's recovery from neck surgery -- perhaps the most talked about neck in the history of sports -- threatens to overshadow Sunday's game, which will feature Manning's brother Eli as quarterback for the Giants. Most people know the injury forced Peyton Manning to sit out the Colts' entire season, resulting in two wins and 14 losses -- a stinking record after 2010's 10-6 season. Now the Colts face an epic decision about whether to pay Manning a $28 million bonus to stay on the team or to cut him loose as a free agent. Has Manning played his last game with the Colts? Indianapolis had its own epic decision to make in the early '80s. At the time, the city had no NFL team. Yet Hudnut, then the mayor, greenlit construction of a $77 million-domed football stadium. Indy was putting out bait to lure the NFL. ""Stones of steel,"" said a fan who recalled the story while walking through Super Bowl Village on Tuesday. ""It took guts."" Before the stadium was finished, the Colts had agreed to move from Baltimore to Indy, triggering a generation of hatred among the Maryland city's fans over the ""theft"" of their storied franchise. It was a major step toward using sports to crank up Indy's status and economic standing. Soon the city was hosting NCAA basketball's Final Four and the NBA All-Star Game. ""Gradually in the '80s and '90s people who knew the city regarded Indianapolis as quite a town -- even though people who didn't know Indy still thought of it as a brickyard and a cornfield,"" Hudnut said. Fast-forward to Sunday when perhaps more than 112 million people will watch the NFL world championship ""taking place in little old Indianapolis,"" said Griswold, the radio host. Mission accomplished. The hosting seems to be going well so far -- thanks in part to unusually warm temperatures in the low 50s at a time when it's usually a few degrees above freezing. ""We're loving it. I had to get out here in the village and see everybody!"" Boyce said. ""Outstanding"" was how Colts wide receiver Reggie Wayne described the weather for WRTV. ""Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves,"" Wayne said, a year after a freak cold snap put a damper on events surrounding the Dallas Super Bowl. ""I haven't heard one bad complaint."" In 1982, Detroit opened the door to cold-weather Super Bowl hosting. New York is scheduled for 2014. ""Our plan was to eventually get into the rotation for future Super Bowls,"" Hudnut said. ""Let's get through the first one, first,"" the NFL's Goodell told WRTV. ""I think the hospitality and the way they have done this will reflect very well on Indianapolis going forward."" Talk of the town . The village -- a $12 million, three-block, ""family-friendly festival"" with shops and restaurants -- has been built not just for Sunday, but for the future. ""After the fans have long gone, other people are going to be able to come in and use this space for decades,"" Boyce said. Meantime, Boyce said she expects Indy to demonstrate the spirit of ""Hoosier Hospitality."" ""We're a friendly folk,"" she said. ""People say hi to you when you walk down the street. It's all the time, not just when the Super Bowl is here."" What's getting the most attention? The zip line is the talk of the town. For $10, you can climb the zip line's 95-foot tower, attach yourself to a metal cable and fly 80 feet above the crowd to another tower 650 feet down the street. ""It's the new version of the bungee jump,"" one woman said. Fans reported the wait last Sunday for the zip line was seven hours. That's almost as long as TV's Super Bowl pregame show. Homeless complaints . But not everyone in Indianapolis is awaiting the big game. Justin Baranowski, 33, a homeless man from California, said, ""Starting at the end of last week the police started pushing us away from certain areas that we're allowed to be in,"" including the Super Bowl Village. Authorities insist officers aren't cracking down because of the game, but they said police are working with private organizations to help get the homeless into shelters. ""We're not moving anyone against their will,"" said Marc Lotter, spokesman for Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard. The city is sharing its Super Bowl gravy with needy segments of the community. A neighborhood without a grocery store now has a food cooperative thanks to private and NFL funds, Boyce said. Another area received a 20,000-square-foot community youth center, including a gym, classrooms and weekly programs such as cooking, fitness and finance. Hosting this game is ""a step of a higher level than we've ever taken before,"" Hudnut said. ""We had to prove that we could be major league."" So what's next for Indy? A Democratic or Republican national convention may not be out of the question, he said. And what about Sunday? ""The best sign of success will be that the city doesn't become the story,"" Griswold said. ""The story needs to be about the game. I honestly think the best report would be people saying that 'the game was great and -- oh yeah by the way Indianapolis was really nice. I had a really good time.' ""","Indianapolis is hosting its first Super Bowl as the Giants take on the Patriots .

"(CNN) -- For the past few days, the NFL punditry here has been remarkably divided on predictions for Super Bowl XLVI. For every expert espousing New England Patriots' depth and balance there is another waxing rhapsodic about the New York Giants' ""momentum"" and ""destiny."" Las Vegas echoed this ambivalence, as the gambling line continues to shift. We'll let others divine the game's outcome. But as you prepare to watch the highest-rated Super Bowl in history, here are some factors to bear in mind. Be careful not to exaggerate the importance of defense . Which team had the worst total defense in the NFL this past season? The Green Bay Packers, who also had the league's best record, 15-1. The Patriots ranked 31 of 32 teams on defense. The Giants ranked 27th, not much better. Huh? Isn't defense a prerequisite for success? Doesn't ""defense win championships?"" Not really. Among almost 10,000 regular season NFL games, the better defensive team has won 66.5% of the time, compared with 67.4% of the time for the better offensive team. You need a good offense or a good defenseâ€”and if you have both, great. So, if defense is no more critical to winning than offense is, why does everyone from Little League coaches to ESPN analysts extoll its importance? Well, no one needs to talk up the virtues of scoring. No one needs to create incentives for players to score more touchdowns. There's a reason why fans exhort ""De-fense, De-fense!"" not ""O-ffense, O-ffense!"" Offense is fun. Offense is glamorous. Who gets the Nike shoe contracts and the other endorsements, the players who score or the defensive stoppers? Quick, which of the following set of names is more recognizable? The top five touchdown leaders in NFL history: Jerry Rice, Emmitt Smith, La-Dainian Tomlinson, Randy Moss, Terrell Owens? Or the top five interception leaders: Paul Krause, Emlen Tunnell, Rod Woodson, Dick Lane, and Ken Riley? Offense leads to glory and fame and money. We don't need to provide incentive for players to score. We need to incentivize them to partake in the activity that doesn't necessarily lead to endorsement deals. What better to do it than by telling players it's indispensable for winning a championship? Consider the home field advantage . As in all sports, in the NFL the home team wins most of the time, 57% of games to be precise. (In only one anomalous year, 1968, did home teams win less than half the games, but that was because there were five ties that season; remove those five tied games and the home field advantage would have been 51%.) This year the game is being played at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. When the Indianapolis Colts lost their quarterback, Peyton Manning, to an injury and posted a miserable 2-14 record this year, it meant that, technically, there would be no ""home team"" for Super Bowl XLVI. But tell that to the fans. Sunday's game features another Manning as quarterback: Eli, who, of course, pilots the Giants' offense. Peyton will be on hand supporting his younger brother. And the fans will take their cue from him. What's more, the opposing Patriots also happen to be the Colts' chief rival, the team the Indianapolis fans dislike the most. For the Patriots, playing in Lucas Oil Stadium will be akin to the Red Sox playing a World Series game in Yankee Stadium. For the Giants, it will be considerably more hospitable. Don't get overheated about the Giants' hot streak . After a dismal first half of the season, triggering murmurs that head coach Tom Coughlin was about to be fired, the Giants suddenly upgraded their play and slipped into the playoffs with a 9-7 record. The team has won five straight games and the conventional wisdom is that they are on a ""hot streak,"" that ""momentum is on their side."" While the team is, undeniably, streaking, that is something different from ""momentum."" Momentum implies predictive value. But there's little evidence that winning a football game predicts how the team will play in the next game. A good team is a good team, and will win most of the time. A poor team is a poor team, and will lose most of time. You can liken this to coin-flipping. Flip a coin 100 times and you will get 50 heads and 50 tails, or thereabouts. But it doesn't mean you'll alternate heads and tails. You may get a run of five heads, then a run of six tails. It doesn't mean there's momentum in coin-flipping. There's simply probability. Investors in financial markets, similarly, get duped into ""chasing returns"" of fund managers. One successful quarter doesn't necessarily predict future success. Same for football. The Giants may prevail on Sunday. But if they do it will be because they are the better team, not because of what's happened in their last few games. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of L. Jon Wertheim.","Jon Wertheim offers a few suggestions for things to pay attention to in the Super Bowl .
He says don't exaggerate the vaunted importance of defense; it's not prerequisite for winning .
He says the game in Indianapolis carries a home field advantage via a rivalry and favorite son .
Wertheim: The Giants may be in a ""hot streak,"" but that's not the same as momentum ."
"(CNN) -- Inter Milan's ended their seven-match winless streak in Serie A with a 2-0 win away to Chievo on Friday. Two late goals from Walter Samuel in the 87th minute and Diego Milito during injury time ensured a crucial three points for Claudio Ranieri's men. Milito's header made amends for a missed penalty in the 14th minute. The win lifts the Nerazzurri up to sixth in the table above Roma who travel to Palermo on Saturday night. ""It's a result which gives us a morale boost. We said in the dressing room that we need to carry on from the second half against Catania,"" said Ranieri. ""This win gives us joy, for a team like Inter to not score in a month is not easy,"" he added. Napoli moved up to fourth place with an entertaining 6-3 win over Cagliari at the Stadio San Paolo. Marek Hamsik opened the scoring in the 10th minute with captain Paolo Cannavaro doubling the lead nine minutes later. Eleven minutes later the home side were three up as Cagliari defender Davide Astori turned the ball into his own net. Joaquin Larrivey pulled one back for Cagliari in the 37th minute. Argentine striker Ezequiel Lavezzi made sure of three points in the 56th minute converting from the penalty spot. Uruguayan midfielder Walter Gargano added a fifth for Napoli in the 70th minute before Larrivey got his second of the night seven minutes later. Christian Maggio restored the four-goal lead seven minutes from time with Larrivey claiming his hat-trick in injury time. Meanwhile in the Bundesliga, Stuttgart drew 0-0 against bottom-of-the-table Kaiserslautern at the Mercedes-Benz Arena.

"(CNN) -- Federal officials say a plane crash that killed 265 people was caused in part by a rudder system design featured in various Airbus models. American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York, soon after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport on November 12, 2001. All 260 people onboard died, along with five people on the ground. According to a recommendation issued this week by the National Transportation Safety Board, the plane's vertical stabilizer likely separated because of ""the first officer's unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs."" But those inputs were likely caused in part by ""characteristics of the Airbus A300-600 rudder system design."" Two families of Airbus planes use a system design that limits available rudder pedal deflection as airspeed decreases, according to the safety board. ""Consequently, at high airspeeds require lighter pedal forces ... to obtain maximum available rudder than at low speeds,"" the safety board wrote. The safety board notes the circumstances of flight 587 are similar to a 2008 accident involving an Airbus Industrie A319. Air Canada Flight 190 experienced ""in-flight upset"" and landed in Calgary. Three passengers suffered serious injuries. The popular Airbus A320 family could also be affected. The European-based company's website says it sold more than 3,200 A320 planes worldwide. ""The Airbus 320 family is also susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher airspeeds,"" the safety board  wrote. Safety board officials recommended the European Aviation Safety Agency review options for modifying some Airbus planes ""to provide increased protection from potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs.""

"Washington (CNN) -- An alleged Colombian rebel whom U.S. authorities accuse of holding three Americans hostage pleaded not guilty Monday. Alexander Beltran Herrera, 35, was arraigned Monday on charges connected with the imprisonment of U.S. citizens Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell. Alleged leftist guerrillas with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, abducted the three U.S. defense contractors in 2003, the Justice Department said. They were among 15 hostages freed in a 2008 rescue mission. For part of a two-year period beginning in November 2004, Beltran Herrera was responsible for moving the hostages and keeping them imprisoned, the Justice Department said in a statement released Monday. ""Throughout the captivity of these three hostages, FARC jailors and guards, including Beltran Herrera, used choke harnesses, chains, padlocks and wires to restrain the hostages, and used force and threats to continue their detention and prevent their escape,"" the statement said. U.S. authorities announced Beltran Herrera's extradition Monday. He arrived in the United States over the weekend. On Monday, prosecutors described Beltran Herrera as a ""fairly high ranking"" member of the FARC. A federal indictment charges him with one count of conspiracy to commit hostage taking, three counts of hostage taking, one count of using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization. He would face a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted of the charges. Beltran Herrera appeared in court Monday wearing an orange jumpsuit. He did not speak during his arraignment and needed a translator's help to understand the proceedings. A court-appointed defense attorney entered his not guilty plea. The indictment names 17 other accused members of the FARC as defendants. Prosecutors said those suspects are still at large. The United States first designated the FARC as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997 and renewed that designation in 2005, the indictment says. The FARC have been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. While severely weakened in recent years, the guerrilla group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. Beltran Herrera's extradition ""underscores our resolve to hold accountable all those responsible for this crime and we will not rest until every one of them is brought to justice,"" said Lisa Monaco, assistant attorney general for national security, in a written statement. The Colombian military rescued Gonsalves, Howes and Stansell in a high-profile helicopter mission in July 2008. Colombian commandos posed as humanitarian aid workers to free the group, which also included former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt and 11 Colombian police and military members. CNN's Carol Cratty and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: An alleged leftist rebel pleads not guilty to holding Americans hostage .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- North Korea says its scientists have concluded their investigation into the failure of the country's long-range rocket launch last week, but it declined to divulge why the flight ended in a trail of debris strewn across the sea. Experts have ""wound up the specific and scientific probe into the cause"" of the rocket's failure to put a satellite into orbit, the official Korean Central News Agency said in a report late Thursday without elaborating on what the cause was. Pyongyang had insisted that the purpose of the launch was to send an ""earth observation satellite"" into space. But the United States, South Korea and Japan called the operation a ballistic missile test in disguise. ""All the scientific and technological data and precious experience gained this time will serve as a very precious boon to space development and a reliable guarantee for greater success in the days ahead,"" the KCNA report said, citing an unidentified spokesman for the Korean Committee for Space Technology. The rocket flew for only about a minute and half after its take off on April 13 before it broke into pieces above the Yellow Sea. On Monday, the U.N. Security Council condemned the failed launch, saying it was ""a serious violation"" of previous council resolutions and ""has caused grave security concerns in the region."" North Korea said in the state media report Thursday that it had ""never recognized"" the U.N. resolution on the matter, describing it as ""a product of sinister intentions of the hostile forces.""","A North Korean rocket broke apart soon after take off last week .

Massive anti-government protests prompted King Hamad al-Khalifa's March 15 declaration of a three-month state of emergency in Bahrain, a strategically important kingdom and U.S. ally. Witnesses reported violent crackdowns on protesters after the state of emergency was imposed. Meanwhile, a trial has started for 21 suspects accused of fostering the unrest, the official Bahrain News Agency reported Sunday. A hard-line Shiite opposition group and a leading human rights activist were among those on trial. The suspects face accusations of ""terrorist attempts to topple the regime forcibly in collaboration with a terrorist organization working for a foreign country,"" the government-run news agency said. Human rights groups said forces have raided hospitals, targeting doctors and patients, during the state of emergency. More than 40 doctors and nurses faced prosecution last week on charges that included having supported ""the saboteurs and the calls to bring down the political regime,"" the news agency said. Government officials in Bahrain denied targeting hospitals. The protests started in February, when young members of the country's Shiite Muslim majority staged protests to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption -- issues they say the country's Sunni rulers have done little to address. Bahrain's ruling Khalifa family is Sunni Muslim, but about two-thirds of the country's people are Shiite. Hard-line protesters have called for the abolition of the country's royal family altogether. Bahrain is home to the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, the naval arm of American power in the region. In a speech last month, the country's crown prince defended the government's actions. ""We were immensely concerned that some of our youth were pushed towards a destructive path and that the nation was drawn along with them,"" Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifasaid, according to an official transcript. ""We took necessary action to preserve lives and the livelihood and interests of all the people, based on our commitment to Islamic and Arab values,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Actress Salma Hayek has been named a knight of the Legion of Honour in France, according to an official government publication. Hayek, 45, is a Mexican-born actress and producer. The notice in the Official Journal of the French government does not elaborate on why she is being honored, but cites her as an ""active member of charities, 23 years of services.""

"(CNN) -- Bahrain, the tiny Arab kingdom engulfed in strife between the Sunni government and the majority Shiite populace, has initiated court action to dissolve two opposition parties, a lawmaker told CNN on Thursday. The claim called for the dissolution of the Wefaq and Al-Amal movements, two Shiite groups in the forefront of recent protests against the Bahrain government, a key U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf. Abdul Khalil Jalil, a member of parliament from Wefaq, confirmed the development but didn't provide details. Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy anchors its Fifth Fleet, is a small predominantly Shiite country governed by a Sunni royal family. It called in Saudi Arabia and other regional troops to help end the protests, which swept across the kingdom earlier this year as populations across the Arab world rose up against their rulers. Bahrain's Sunni Muslim monarchy has long suspected Iran of attempting to foment unrest among the island's majority-Shiite population, leaked U.S. diplomatic documents show, and Iran has asserted territorial claims over the onetime Persian province both before and after the 1979 revolution brought the current Islamic republic to power . The government has come under fire by human rights groups for its stiff crackdown. A fourth person who died while in the custody of Bahrain police in recent days may have been tortured, Human Rights Watch said Wednesday, as it called for urgent investigations into the deaths of detainees. The Bahrain government has said in the past all accusations about detainees will be investigated. Protesters initially took to the streets of Manama, the capital, to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy. But some are now calling for the removal of the royal family, which has led the Persian Gulf state since the 18th century. Young members of the country's Shiite Muslim majority have staged protests in recent years to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption, issues they say the country's Sunni rulers have done little to address.

"(CNN) -- A computer programmer from Canada faces imminent execution in Iran for the actions of another person, which he had no control over, a human rights group says. Saeed Malekpour wrote a program to upload photos to the Internet, an accomplishment that could cost him his life, Amnesty International reported Friday. Authorities in the Islamic Republic claimed his program was used by someone else to upload pornography and charged him with ""insulting and desecrating Islam."" Malekpour, who is a Toronto resident, was arrested in October 2008 while visiting relatives in Iran. He was convicted in a short trial and was sentenced to death in October 2011, according to Amnesty International. Iran's Supreme Court confirmed the sentence on January 17. Malekpour's lawyers have been unable to ascertain the whereabouts of his court files since Tuesday and fear this could be an indicator that an executioner could carry out the sentence soon, Amnesty said. A court official suggested to the lawyers that the file had been sent to the Office for the Implementation of Sentences, according to Amnesty. Malekpour sent a letter from prison detailing beatings and other mistreatment at the hands of Iranian prison officials to obtain a confession, said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. ""A large portion of my confession was extracted under pressure, physical and psychological torture, threats to myself and my family, and false promises of immediate release upon giving a false confession to whatever the interrogators dictated,"" the letter says. Malekpour's supporters have created Facebook pages and websites in his support dating to at least 2009. Amnesty International has requested on its website that concerned individuals write Iranian authorities inside and outside the country to demand that Malekpour not be executed.","Saeed Malekpour wrote a computer program to upload photos to the internet .

"London (CNN) -- A long-lost picture of Britain's King Edward VIII reveals the monarch's portrait was ""edited"" after his abdication to show his replacement, King George VI. Edward VIII posed for popular periodical ""The Illustrated London News"" in 1936, ahead of his planned coronation. But when the monarch stepped down before he was officially crowned, artist Albert H Collings recycled the image, painting over Edward's face in an early version of the ""airbrushing"" familiar to today's magazine readers. ""We tend to think of it as a modern thing, but this just shows it has been going on forever,"" said Illustrated London News chief executive Lisa Barnard. ""I suppose the thinking was that the original would never be seen, so no one would ever know,"" she told CNN, adding, ""editors have always had to be resourceful -- news changes, and they have to change with it. ""We found a note of how much the artists were paid for the portraits -- hundreds of pounds, which was a lot of money at the time -- and the magazine would not have wanted to waste that."" The alteration came to light following the discovery of a proof copy of a special coronation edition of the magazine. When images of the coronation that never happened were published in British newspapers, one eagle-eyed reader noticed the striking similarity between the unknown painting of Edward VIII, and the image of George VI, which was published in a later issue of the periodical. Barnard said the portrait was not the only item from the unpublished Edward VIII coronation special to be recycled. ""They were able to reuse some of the more general articles for the George VI coronation issue, and some other pictures of the coronation robes were also 'edited' to show George VI -- again, the artist just changed the heads. ""Days after the abdication was announced, the magazine put out a special 'abdication and accession' edition, and they ran a whole essay which had been due to run in the coronation issue as a tribute to Edward VIII, and which became, in effect, a eulogy."" It is thought the magazine's editor Sir Bruce Ingram was tipped off days before the abdication that the coronation issue might not be needed. In a page of notes attached to the proof copy and dated December 3, 1936 -- a week before the official announcement -- he has written a list of alterations and revisions needed ""if Ed. VIII abdicates."" ""It is a sign of a smart editor, thinking on his feet and making the most of what they had,"" Barnard told CNN. Edward VIII became King on the death of his father, George V, in January 1936 but reigned for less than a year before stepping aside on December 11 to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. His younger brother, George VI, who had never expected to become King, was named as his successor. The story of the new monarch's struggle against a debilitating stutter in the early days of his reign was chronicled in the Oscar-winning movie ""The King's Speech.""","Rediscovered picture of King Edward VIII reveals portrait was reworked as King George VI .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan prosecutors have gathered ""great evidence"" against the son of former dictator Moammar Gadhafi, International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Thursday, reopening the controversial question of where Saif al-Islam Gadhafi will be tried. Both the International Criminal Court and Libya's new authorities want to put him on trial, and the two sides have been battling over it since his capture in November. The court demanded this month that Libya hand him over immediately to face accusations of crimes against humanity, but Libya appealed the decision. Libyan interim Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib told CNN in an exclusive interview that Gadhafi could ""absolutely"" get a fair trial in Libya and that he should face justice there. ""We intend to project the real image of the new Libya,"" he said. Asked about the doubts voiced by human rights groups over the country's capacity to stage the trial properly, he responded: ""I can guarantee you that we will prove them wrong, we are ready ... to go and give him the proper justice and a fair trial."" Moreno-Ocampo, visiting Libya on Thursday, raised the possibility that the Libyan wish would be granted. Libyan prosecutors told him they had interviewed witnesses, including ""high-level people"" they have in custody, and had gathered phone intercepts and documents, Moreno-Ocampo said. It includes specific evidence showing Saif allegedly committing crimes with his own hands, not just ordering it, he said. Moreno-Ocampo said he had just learned for the first time that the Libyans had opened an investigation in December. ""We had a meeting with the Libyan prosecutor,"" he said. ""For the first time we learned he opened an investigation in December 2011 about the same crimes we investigated, and he has many witnesses. So he has a case."" Libyan authorities must now present their evidence to International Criminal Court judges, along with the explanation of how they will be able to hold a fair trial, the international prosecutor said. ""Now Libya has to present this to the judges. And they promised to do that,"" he said. They consider it ""crucial"" for the Libyan people to see the son of the late dictator face justice in his own country, Moreno-Ocampo said the authorities told him. ""The Libyans have to see Saif here, and they have to show that they can do it. That's the goal,"" he said. If the ICC judges are satisfied, they will allow Libya to try Saif al-Islam themselves, he said. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi was facing an arrest warrant from the court for alleged crimes against humanity at the time fighters from the Libyan city of Zintan captured him. He has been detained there since November. El-Keib said authorities in Tripoli were in negotiations with those holding Gadhafi in Zintan to transfer him to the capital. The Zintan representatives are worried about his safety and security, El-Keib said, but those concerns are ones that can be met. The handover ""won't take long,"" he said. ICC defense lawyers said April 5 that Gadhafi had been mistreated and ""physically attacked"" in custody. Gadhafi is in a ""legal black hole,"" held in ""total isolation"" except for visits from officials, his ICC-appointed defense said in a strongly worded statement. He also suffers dental pain because he hasn't had treatment, and Libyan authorities have given him nothing to remedy the pain, lawyers Xavier-Jean Keita and Melinda Taylor said. ""The brutal death of Moammar Gadhafi deprived the Libyan people of their right to justice and their right to the truth. It would be a travesty for the prospects of a free and fair Libyan state if the same were to occur to his son,"" they said. Moammar Gadhafi died after opposition forces captured him in October. But El-Keib rejected the defense attorneys' suggestion that the younger Gadhafi was suffering ill treatment in captivity. ""I can guarantee you that he has been safe, he has been treated definitely in a humane and a very decent manner,"" he said. Drawing a contrast with the regime under Moammar Gadhafi, El-Keib said Libya had ""definitely changed tremendously -- it's 180 degrees (different) when it comes to human rights and respecting human rights.""

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Militants launched a fresh attack Monday in Nigeria's second largest city, Kano, which is already reeling from a series of bombings and shootings that killed more than 200 people earlier this month. A police station in Mandawari was attacked at 6 a.m., just after the dusk-to-dawn curfew was lifted, police said. No one was hurt. Hours earlier, gunmen on motorbikes hit a police station in Naibowa, killing two people. The Sunday evening attack lasted about 40 minutes, said Sani Abdu, a resident who lives close to the station. No one immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on the militant group Boko Haram, which has carried out multiple bombings and shootings across the north in recent days. On January 20, at least 211 people were killed in Kano in attacks that left the police headquarters and other government buildings in charred ruins. In response, President Goodluck Jonathan fired the west African nation's inspector general of police. Depending on the faction, Boko Haram's ambitions range from the stricter enforcement of Islamic Sharia law to the total destruction of the government. Its grievances remain local, but it has attacked international institutions --- such as the United Nations -- on Nigerian soil. An August 26 attack -- during which a Boko Haram suicide bomber drove a Jeep laden with explosives into the U.N. headquarters in Abuja -- was one of the deadliest in the world body's history. Twenty-four people were killed, including 12 U.N. staff. The group was formed in 2002 by Islamic preacher Mohammad Yusuf as an outgrowth of ethnic tensions in the country in the 1990s. Nigeria's population is split between mostly Muslims living in the north and predominantly Christians in the south. Yusuf advocated the institution of Sharia law throughout the northern states and opposed democracy. The group operated openly out of northeastern Nigeria and staged small-scale attacks against government targets. In 2009, Nigerian police forces moved to crack down on Boko Haram. Harsh police tactics led to an armed uprising and the arrest of Yusuf, who later died in police custody. The death spurred the group to begin its attacks on police stations. Ensuing clashes between group members and the police killed hundreds. Journalist Hassan John in Jos contributed to this report .","Attacks on police stations are becoming commonplace .

"Moscow (CNN) -- In her previous life, Kseniya Sobchak bared her soul -- and a lot more -- as Russia's version of Paris Hilton, a socialite with her own reality show. One installment of her 2008 production ""A Blonde in Chocolate"" featured her sprawled on the floor sporting white, stiletto-heeled boots, a slip and a fur wrap, looking as if she'd had a tough night on the town. But even then, Sobchak tells CNN, she was a closet political junkie. ""During my Paris Hilton years,"" she says with a smile, ""I was always saying that I'm better off in show business and better doing some stuff that people would call cheesy. But I wouldn't do something to betray my political tastes."" And political tastes she had. The daughter of political icon Anatoly Sobchak -- the former mayor of St. Petersburg who helped to launch Vladimir Putin's career in government back in the early 1990s -- is trying to transform herself into a political animal, a talking head, and an opponent of Putin. ""I was always feeling something, torn between my respect for the help of Mr. Putin for my father in early years and for their work together,"" she says. ""But I always was torn between (my father's) work, because he was a democrat and I think would never have dreamt of living in a situation like this in Russia."" Sobchak's favorite look these days is a chic dark blouse, blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail, and a pair of oversized, black-framed glasses. It is a cool but serious image, befitting her new incarnation, which began at a key moment last year. It was September 24, 2011, when Vladimir Putin stunned his fellow Russians with the announcement that he, and not the current president, Dmitry Medvedev, would be running for election -- again. Putin had become prime minister after serving the maximum two consecutive terms as president. ""They decided to change Medvedev for Putin and Putin for Medevedev and then they give out the results,"" Sobchak says indignantly. ""That's not how it should work and people feel offended."" Sobchak exploits her fame and uses her well-honed media skills to get her message across. In one political video called ""I am voting for ..."" Sobchak, her hair disheveled, T-shirt falling off her shoulder, looking straight at the camera with a kind of dull, programmed expression, says she's voting for ""the candidate"" (no name mentioned) who is ""benevolent"" and has helped Russians to live better. ""Especially now,"" she says, ""at this time of threat from an 'Orange Revolution of the Syrian and Libyan variety' you can't rock the boat. You have to unite behind one candidate."" One second after she announces that she is voting for that ""candidate"" a man tapes her mouth shut, she's strapped to a chair and armed men carry her off screaming with tongue-in-cheek horror. Who is Sobchak really voting for? Billionaire candidate Mikhail Prokhorov. ""I don't think that Prokhorov would become the president,"" she laughs, ""but he's handsome! And I would vote for him. Why not?"" Some question Sobchak's new image and her political conversion. At one opposition rally where she spoke the crowd loudly booed her. Putin, she thinks, will be elected president again, but Russia is no longer the same. ""My forecast? He will try to strengthen and tighten the system,"" she says. ""But now, with the protests on the streets, it's not possible any longer. So it will take, I think, a couple of years of a real protest movement to change the situation.""","Kseniya Sobchak says she was true to her political tastes even during her ""Paris Hilton years""

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- When you consider (1) that he's a comic actor known for playing dysfunctional characters, and (2) the photo above, you might expect Rainn Wilson's presentation at SXSW Interactive to have been full of laughs. And you would be right. For the first 20 minutes. Wilson, best known for his role as the aggressively clueless Dwight Schrute on TV's ""The Office,"" began his talk with random slides (""Here's a baby monkey riding a boar""), gags about the early days of the Internet and jokes about his postings on Twitter, where he has almost 3 million followers. ""Friendster still exists,"" he said while reminiscing about his dial-up Web history. ""It's like an Internet ghost town ... where all the people are preserved in amber, circa 2003."" An audience of several thousand people, who packed a cavernous hall for a talk billed as ""The View from Inside Rainn Wilson's Brainstem,"" laughed along. But then Wilson shifted gears, turned earnest and devoted the rest of his session to Soul Pancake, the website he co-founded to help people explore life's big questions. ""Soul Pancake is really an expression of who I am as a human being,"" said the actor, a member of the Baha'i faith. ""It's very important to me. It's very personal."" Launched in 2009, the site encourages users to post thought-provoking musings about spirituality, philosophy, creativity and other meaty topics. Users can read original content while posing questions, engaging in discussions and undertaking creative activities such as writing exercises. It attracts a modest following -- about a million page views a month -- and is still not profitable, Wilson said. He said he launched the site to ""de-lamilfy spirituality,"" to promote conversations and to bring people together about metaphysical topics. Also? ""Spirit Taco was taken."" Wilson argued the Web has a unique power to inspire users -- he cited his own past as an awkward, lonely teen-ager who was looking to connect with like-minded people -- by helping them make sense of things and find their place in the world. ""I believe the Internet is the future of spirituality,"" he said. ""It's a spiritual act to share a beautiful photo on Instagram. It's a spiritual act to sell something beautiful you've crafted on Etsy."" Wilson said Soul Pancake has evolved into a media-production company that is launching a YouTube channel and creating programming for Oprah Winfrey's TV network. He showed a brief original clip of a ""Heart Attack"" -- cheerful dancers in cartoon-heart costumes, making people smile by engulfing them on a California boardwalk. ""That's why I'm sharing this,"" said Wilson, a 46-year-old husband and father. ""We need connection. We need compassion. We need nurturing."" Wilson's heartfelt tone and proselytizing may have caught audience members off guard. Some trickled out midway through his talk. But he still found time for a few comedic riffs. On audience interaction: ""Any questions? I don't care. Shut up."" On the Buddha: ""He's a chubby guy. He's like the Andy Richter of religious icons."" On his ill-fated (and made-up) attempt to launch Twatter, a social-media service in which messages must be a minimum of 140,000 characters: ""I lost millions of dollars. Terrible idea.""","Actor Rainn Wilson (""The Office"") spoke Saturday at South By Southwest .

"(CNN) -- A power supply problem left passengers stuck on Eurostar trains between Britain and France for several hours on Monday and early Tuesday, the high-speed rail company said. The glitch in the overhead electricity lines on the French side of the tunnel under the English Channel caused big delays on trains running in both directions. Eurostar, the company that operates the service, canceled several trains Monday and experienced ""severe delays totaling many hours on others,"" said a company spokeswoman. Some trains were still between stations at 1:45 a.m. Tuesday in Britain, she added. The train operator has also canceled four trains scheduled for Tuesday and expects more delays, the spokeswoman said, since the power supply problem means the trains can't use the high-speed lines they usually travel on. CNN's Juliet Mann was trying to get from Paris to London by Eurostar on Monday afternoon. ""It was very obvious as we trundled through the French countryside that we had been diverted from our usual route,"" she said, saying the train driver made regular stops to check for status updates via fax. ""We pulled into (London's) St. Pancras (station) four hours later than planned after the scenic tour of northern France,"" she said. Eurostar gave passengers regular updates and glasses of water, and offered them a complimentary round-trip journey, Mann said. The travel disruption took place at an inconvenient time for the fashion world, coming near the end of a week of Pret A Porter shows in Paris. The Eurostar runs a route between London and Paris, stopping in some cases at smaller towns in between. CNN's Brian Walker and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Passengers get the scenic tour of northern France, CNN's Juliet Mann says .

"(Rolling Stone) -- For me Ronnie's passing is the end of an era. Ronnie Montrose gave me my first break as a songwriter, as a front man, as a recording artist and as a touring artist, and for that I will always be grateful. The first Montrose album was the first album I ever recorded and it still stands as one of the best recordings I have ever been a part of. I wrote songs with him, but it was his trip. He's the guy that got me to sing with him. I had no experience whatsoever; I just wrote the first four songs in my life, which were ""Bad Motor Scooter,"" ""Make It Last,"" ""One Thing on My Mind,"" and ""I Don't Want It,"" played them for Ronnie upon first meeting, shook my hand, and said, ""Let's start a band."" I went from zero to a hundred. I saw him at Winterland with the Edgar Winter Group, [touring in support of] They Only Come Out at Night, with ""Free Ride"" and ""Frankenstein."" I didn't know who he was; I didn't know anything about him. I had a soul band -- we were playing Tower of Power and James Brown -- and we sat there and watched Edgar Winter. I told my guitar player, ""I want you to be like that"" -- like Ronnie Montrose. And he's going, ""I don't want to play that kind of music,"" and I'm going, ""Well, I do."" We got into it. It broke my band up, seeing Ronnie for the first time. I said, ""I'm going to be like that guy. I'm going to play guitar like that and I'm going to sing like...the way I sing."" I was talking to a guy a couple of days after the show, and he said, ""That's Ronnie Montrose, and that was his last show. He lives in Sausalito."" I lived in San Francisco, and I said, ""Do you have his address?"" because I didn't even have a phone. He gave it to me, and I went and knocked on his door, dressed like David Bowie -- big old high heel platform shoes, satin pants, probably had make-up on, with a Les Paul and a notebook pad with all kinds of lyrics in it. I said, ""I'm Sammy Hagar. I heard you're looking for a singer."" He said, ""Come on in. You got any songs?"" I played him my four songs, we shook hands, and he said, ""Let's start a band. Do you know any drummers? I've got a bass player, Bill Church."" I had a drummer, Denny Carmassi -- wasn't in my band, but he was my favorite drummer around town. Within a month we were signed to Warner Bros. Records, Ted Templeman producing, and the first Montrose album was born a month after that. It was the fastest thing I've ever done in my life. Like I said, I went from zero to a hundred in the blink of an eye -- all because of Ronnie. He was a changeling. Ronnie never liked to stick with anything. We made one of the greatest hard rock/heavy metal albums of all time with that first Montrose album, and then he didn't want to do that anymore. ""Nah, nah, we've got to have better songs, we've got to change our image, that kind of music is out."" Boy, he was just laying it on us. Ronnie really liked to change -- immediately. We butted heads and I got thrown out of the band [after one more album, 1974's Paper Money], but I carried on with that ""first Ronnie Montrose"" I saw. What I learned from Ronnie Montrose, I still utilize today when I step on a stage. I try to keep the energy up and the entertainment high. The first time Eddie Van Halen and I met, it was around 1977. We were on a stadium show with Boston, Black Sabbath, myself, Van Halen. He came to my dressing room, and said, ""I'm a Montrose freak, I love the band!"" And Ted Templeman told me, when he signed Van Halen, they were called something else, and he wanted to name them after the guitar player. He said on the first Van Halen record, he took the first Montrose record in there and said, ""Boom. We're going to have eight great songs, they're going to be this long, they're going to be this tempo."" And pretty much patterned the whole thing after it -- right down to saying, ""Why don't you guys get Sammy Hagar to sing in this band? He's been thrown out of Montrose."" That's a true story! Eddie had a totally new twist on the whole guitar style thing, but as far as the chording goes -- not his soloing as much as the chording -- yeah, he took some of that big open chord thing [from Montrose]. The big open A, the big open D, the big open E. Everything as open as you could make it, to make it as heavy as possible with one guitar. And that was pretty much Ronnie's style, too. And of course the fire, too -- Van Halen came out with all that fire, which is Ronnie. Ronnie was full of fire, man. [I last spoke to Montrose] a couple of weeks ago, and about a week before that, and then four or five days before that. We were talking a lot, because we were planning a Montrose reunion for my birthday in Cabo this year. Montrose, the whole band, has not been there. Denny's been there, Bill's been there, Ronnie's been there -- but [the whole band together] has never been there. I said to Ronnie, ""Come on, man. We're all getting old. Let's do this again while we can."" And he was in, we were all in. On my 65th, on October 13th, I was planning on coming out with Montrose, doing the whole first album, then going in with my other band, and then bringing Chickenfoot out. I was going to try to [cover] my whole four decades for the fans that night, without nobody knowing. And Ronnie was in. It's crazy. I even played back on my message box, February 10th -- ""Hagar, Ronzo...call me back!"" It was all good. It's f***ed up that those songs will never be played by those four members again. Songs can go forever, but we can't. [I would like Montrose to be remembered] as one of the pioneers of American heavy/hard rock. And certainly, one of the great hard rock guitar players. But he was more than that -- he was really versatile. But if you're going to remember him for anything, put on that first Montrose record. The only positive I can grab onto is the fact that the music will live on. It's a shame to lose Ronnie and I'm so sorry for his loved ones. Rest in peace. As told to Greg Prato .

"Florence, Italy (CNN) -- The captain of the shipwrecked cruise liner Costa Concordia faced a closed-door hearing Monday over whether he should remain under house arrest. Francesco Schettino faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship after the vessel struck rocks and rolled onto its side in the waters off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13. Sixteen bodies have been recovered, and 16 people remain missing from the roughly 4,200 people who were aboard the cruise liner. One of Schettino's lawyers, Salvatore Parascandola, said the defense team was ""optimistic"" that he would be freed from house arrest. ""We don't think that any of the (justifications) for Schettino's house arrest are valid. He is not going to escape or to repeat the crime,"" Parascandola said. Prosecutor Stefano Pizza did not speak to reporters as he entered or left the court. Prosecutors want Schettino's house arrest revoked and the captain sent back to jail to await trial. By law, the three-judge panel has three days to reach a verdict on house arrest. In his answers to prosecutors, defense attorneys and a judge investigating the case last month, Schettino admitted he made a ""mistake"" in striking the rocks. ""I hit this projection of rock that seems almost stuck into the ship, but this was my mistake,"" Schettino said, according to a 126-page transcript. ""... There isn't anything I can say, as I was convinced that passing within .28 of a mile there wouldn't be any problem."" The captain also brushed aside suggestions that at 15 knots, he was going too fast, as alleged by prosecutors. ""There isn't a speed limit,"" he said. ""... We had more or less the speed needed to reach Savona on time."" According to the transcript, Schettino said he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking. ""This is what allowed me to limit the tilting,"" he said. Maritime lawyer Jim Allsworth said the maneuver is ""fairly standard"" in the case of a ship taking on water and in danger of sinking or capsizing. ""The best thing to do is to put it aground to stop it sinking."" But in statements made during a phone conversation with a friend, Schettino said managers pressured him to steer the ship to the area where the collision occurred, two Italian newspapers reported Wednesday. La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera published excerpts from a telephone conversation Schettino had with a friend after his January 14 arrest. The captain called his friend from the prosecutor's office, and authorities tapped the phone, the newspapers said. ""In my place, someone else wouldn't have been so benevolent to have gone right under there, because they have pissed me off, go, go there,"" Schettino said, in an apparent reference to getting close to the island, according to the newspapers. ""The shallows were there, but it wasn't signaled by the instruments that I had, and I went through ... in order to follow what the managers wanted."" Schettino attorney Alessandro Antichi confirmed the wiretap but would not comment on the conversation. The information should not have been published, he said, as it is part of the investigation. The man behind the steering wheel, Jacob Rusli Bin, told investigators that after the ship struck the rocks, Schettino cursed and said he had not seen them, La Repubblica reported. Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Schettino's behavior. Costa cannot conduct an independent investigation because prosecutors seized the ship's data recorder. The recorder had some connection problems but is working, Costa chief executive Per Luigi Foschi has said. It contains conversation recordings and navigation system data, he said. Cruise ship passengers described a scene of panic and confusion as they rushed for lifeboats. Some said the crew seemed overwhelmed and did not have accurate information on what was taking place. In the transcript, Schettino also described the chaos, saying that he helped passengers onto lifeboats and that some became stuck because of the angle of the listing ship. He said he was trying to launch a lifeboat when he realized he was no longer on board. ""I was then on the lifeboat. It isn't as if I had boarded it,"" he said. ""Look, I fell on its roof."" However, in the wiretapped conversation, Schettino told the friend, ""When I understood that the ship was tilting, I decided to leave, and left,"" according to Corriere della Sera. A captain's leaving the ship with passengers still aboard is difficult to defend, said Italian criminal defense attorney Ugo Meucci, who does not represent Schettino. ""This is a very difficult position because our law is very strong, and the risk is very high for the captain,"" who could face a 15-year jail sentence, Meucci said. CNN's Dan Rivers and Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.","Schettino faces possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship .

"(CNN) -- If there is a central public sentiment about economics prevailing in America right now, it seems to be this: We want to go back to our manufacturing roots. The heyday of manufacturing, the block-long plants that produce not just tangible goods, but big, heavy ones like cars, gave us economic stability once; it can do it again. On Wednesday, President Obama spoke at the Master Lock factory in Milwaukee and said, ""What's happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. What happens in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh and Milwaukee, that's what we've got to be shooting for, is to create opportunities for hardworking Americans to get in there and start making stuff again and sending it all over the world -- products stamped with three proud words: Made in America."" But as with most nostalgic visions, this one doesn't reflect economic realities. First, it's understandable why we have a romantic association with manufacturing. ""Factory nostalgia"" is economically legitimate, because it harkens back to the period of the greatest growth in the U.S. economy in history, basically 1950 to 1973. During that period, there was growth not just in production, but in real household incomes, which is something we have seen little of for the last 40 years. This gave rise to a burgeoning, powerful middle class, and more than that, a sense that all of America shared in the economic boom, with the assembly line tethering us like an anchor to shared prosperity. Compare this image to the more recent service-based economy. The source of the common bond -- the assembly line -- is gone. Instead, people are tied to their own education, their own human capital. Because of that, they're more stand-alone. And so since 1973, we face this widening inequality, partly because our incomes are more tied to individuals, and individuals are different. There's a huge variance across their abilities and educations, and incomes are tied directly to those things. And this situation creates the political tension we face in America; consequently, we long for manufacturing because we associate that with the strength of the middle class. But can we go back to the assembly line? To answer that, there is another important factor to keep in mind. The enormous growth from 1950-73 wasn't entirely of our own making. It was partly due to our own initiative and education, but we also must remember that in 1950, Japan, Germany, Britain and France were all leveled because of World War II. We had no competition. Today, not only are all those countries competing against us, but so are China, India and other countries in South America and Africa -- countries with very large and growing populations. It's not the same game, and in that sense, we're naÃ¯ve to think we can repeat the '50s and '60s if we just pull our bootstraps up. The world was much different then. Further, there's a very important caveat to people who respond that we should just close our borders and make everything here. As an economic policy, that belief will only serve to hurt standards of living here and globally. There is a large body of evidence that shows that economic growth comes from three things: good geography, sound institutions and strong trade partnerships with the rest of the world. So, going back to closing the borders will only hurt us in the long run. Despite the recent, well-publicized successes in U.S. auto manufacturing, what is happening in the American economy is not the reversal of a trend toward declining manufacturing. Rather, it's a slowing down of the rate of loss of manufacturing, or almost a stabilization of the decline of manufacturing in this country. For the last 25 - 30 years, companies moved manufacturing to China where labor costs were considerably less and there existed an enormous consumer market. But the subsequent rapid per capita income growth in China has meant a rise in the relative price of their labor, so the cost differential is being alleviated. This cost differential is being further narrowed by China once again allowing its currency to gain in value compared to the U.S. dollar. Once that differential diminishes, the rate of manufacturing decline has to slow. However, this does not signal that ""in-sourcing"" or ""re-shoring"" is on the rise in America. Low-technology manufacturing is not anything we will ever get back to permanently. It's just too costly to produce here, and even if China becomes less attractive, there's still Latin America, and much of Asia and Africa. Going forward for decades, we simply don't have a comparative advantage in producing low-technology manufactured goods. But we can retain manufacturing strength in the high-technology goods, as long as we commit to providing the level of education that employees will need to meet the labor demand. There are those high-tech jobs such as the assembly of iPhones and iPads that require proximity to component suppliers -- the chipmakers, the semiconductors, the circuitry -- which can and probably will continue to be performed in countries with less-skilled workforces. However, there are many tasks associated with such complex products -- research and development, for example -- that don't require proximity to these suppliers and those provide jobs that America can gain. If manufacturing is to have a reinvigorated future in America, this is where the growth will be seen. But education is the key to the U.S. being able to take advantage of this opportunity One of the biggest issues that I hear from managers and executives is that they need to hire workers, but can't find those who have the educational skills to be productive. This condition alone will lead to a permanently higher unemployment rate. We may not, in the foreseeable future, get down to 5% unemployment because of the significant number of people who lack the skills for high-tech manufacturing jobs and the current underemployment and long duration of unemployment that is depreciating our workers' skills. As a country, we face the risk that we will lose out in our ability to compete in manufacturing to Europe, Japan and others. So the nostalgia for our industrial past should be turned into a vision for a better way to educate our children. On a number of indices, we are in the bottom half of the richest 30 countries in terms of primary and secondary education performance for skills in math and reading comprehension. Forty years ago, we were right near the top. Some people are losing out on their opportunities for a better economic future even by age 4. We simply must return to our commitment to invest in human capital. Follow @CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored the only goal of the match with a stunning backheel as Real Madrid beat Rayo Vallecano to stay 10 points clear in the Spanish title race Sunday. Real had to work hard to emerge on top in the capital derby at the Vallecas while arch-rivals Barcelona won 2-1 against Atletico Madrid in the late kickoff to avoid falling further behind Jose Mourinho's men. The reigning champions owed their win to a Lionel Messi free-kick in the 80th minute. It was his 28th league goal of the season, one fewer than Ronaldo. Dani Alves opened the scoring on 36 minutes but Radamel Falcao equalized at the beginning of the second half for the home side. Earlier, the first half of the clash between the Madrid rivals was short of chances, but Rayo came closest to scoring as Michu rattled the woodwork with Iker Casillas beaten. Ronaldo struck shortly after the break following a corner. He was running away to chase a loose ball, but then fashioned an incredible backheeled effort which flew into the net. ""A backheel is always different. It was a great goal but I'm not sure if it was the best of my career -- I have to see it again on TV,"" Ronaldo told AFP. Jose Callejon later wasted a chance to double the lead for Los Blancos to calm their nerves. Ronaldo was also denied a second by home keeper Joel late on before the home side lost Michu to a red card for a rash challenge. It was Real's 21st league win of the season.","Real Madrid win 1-0 at Rayo Vallecano to stay top in Spain .

"(CNN) -- For some, the name ""Williamsburg"" conjures images of people wearing tricorner hats and churning butter. For others, the name brings images of people wearing skinny jeans and churning organic butter. The former are thinking of Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, a popular family vacation spot whose slogan is ""The Future May Learn from the Past."" The latter are thinking of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a popular liberal arts grad landing spot whose slogan could be ""Past: It's Me, Not You; L8er, the Future."" Full-throated endorsements of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, are hard to come by. People find it too trendy or played out. Press further, and critiques fall into two categories: 1) It used to be cool, but now it's filled with fauxhemians: middle-class post-college kids looking for la vie boheme. 2) It's Exhibit A in the case against gentrification: Affordable rent brought artists, artists brought poseurs, poseurs and artists made it hospitable for investment bank bachelors, all three groups raised rents and forced out the low-income population that lived there in the '70s. All of these complaints are right, of course, just as they would be in many places in New York metro. But they rest on one fundamental truth: People (whether they're your people or not) find Williamsburg attractive. On a recent visit, after being away for several years, I was reminded of why: It's a vibrant little village that punches far above its weight culturally and culinarily.  It teems with small businesses, and its streets are abustle, thick with beautiful youth in all manner of pomp. New Yorkers might be inured to the charms of an ""emerging"" neighborhood, but to a visitor Williamsburg, Brooklyn, can be just as eccentric and strangely charming as that other Williamsburg. I was there to visit old friends, partially reformed rabble-rousers who once raised hell here but are raising a family now instead. They were running behind, so I decided to ""flaneur"" the 10-block walk to their house.  I began at Seventh and Bedford Avenue, the gritty heart of the neighborhood, where the L train from Manhattan makes its first stop in Brooklyn. On some evenings, Bedford can feel like Bourbon Street for hipsters -- a corridor of beer-breathed smokers moving from one bar to the next -- but it being early evening on a Sunday,  the debauch-o-meter was dialed down. My first stop was Spoonbill and Sugartown, a beloved local bookstore that anchors a boutique mini-mall. Browsers clogged the shop, perusing design magazines and scanning book titles. Laptops remained sheathed in shoulder bags as people chicken-winged books and skimmed through literary journals. I bought a manual about how to be invisible that was written by a ninja. (I figured that after I read it I could just slip back into the store and take whatever other book I wanted.) New Yorkers might take scads of robust independently owned stores in stride, but for Americans who have been chainstored over the past decade, it's as much of a sight to behold as an open-air museum about colonial times.*  Spoonbill, like many of the shops in the neighborhood, is among the best in the country in what it does. Same can be said for Main Drag Music, an instrument shop up the street.  Same with Mikey's Hookup, the local electronics shop. Or the local bike shops. The ""small businessmen"" we hear so much about in election years are thriving in Williamsburg. When I left Spoonbill, I crossed the street  to UVA wines to pick up a house gift. (As the childless friend, it is my responsibility to bring the mischief.) Uva is just one of several small, competent liquor shops that litter the neighborhood. I bought a bottle and crossed the street again to buy socks (I miscounted when packing for my trip) at ID New York, a men's clothing store. But I could have just as easily ventured to Oak or In God We Trust or Beacon's Closet, all smartly curated clothing shops within a few blocks. Now carrying a ninja book, a bottle of wine and a pair of socks, I crossed the street again to visit Bedford Cheese Shop. At Bedford, you're welcome to sample cheese to your partially clogged heart's content, so that's what I did. When I was done, I handed the clerk the bottle of wine I bought, told her how much I wanted to spend and was given two hunks of dairy wrapped in paper. A text from my friends; they're still not ready to receive visitors. So I forged ahead with my wine, my cheese, my socks and my ninja book in tow.  I watched steam come off people's heads as they left the Metropolitan Rec Center, an indoor public pool. In addition to the rec center, Williamsburg has decently maintained baseball fields, tennis and bocce courts and a handsome track, the sort of public amenities that many towns can only dream about. They're well-maintained remnants of a more optimistic time in America. Again, oddly wonderful for an outsider to see. Once past the Rec Center, a little bar light caught my eye, so ... I crossed the street yet again. I found myself in Maison Premiere, a new bar made to look old. Dim lights, bourgie cocktails, mounds of oysters, and within minutes I was behind a drink and slurping the briny insides of cold shells. Looking around the horseshoe bar, I noticed that everyone else seemed to be taking this well-appointed, affordable bar in stride. I, on the other hand, was delighted with myself for stumbling across it. (I shouldn't have been; Brooklyn has a disproportionate amount of handsome drinking establishments: Hotel Delmano and Night of Joy, for two.) A burst on my phone reminded me it was time to push off, but before I reached my destination, I made one last stop at a new restaurant (and there is always a new restaurant here) named Isa. Stepping inside, I felt like I had entered Northern California. Wood, beards, a menu that looked like a flier for a psychedelic concert. I filed it away for another night. And then finally I made it to my friends' apartment, a cozy rent-controlled two bedroom in a brownstone. As I unpacked my wine, my cheese, my socks and my ninja book (none of which cost more than $12, by the by) and recounted how I spent my past hour, it occurred to me that there aren't many neighborhoods in America where I could have taken that walk. In less than a mile, I was able to survey a host of small pleasures. I met courteous shop owners who clearly dig their gigs.  And I got an eyeful of stylish and attractive folks enjoying life's rich pageant. Do I want everywhere like this? Absolutely not, but I don't have to worry about that. Hardly anywhere is like this. I think people exhausted with Williamsburg forget that. For those who haven't been, post-colonial Williamsburg is worth a visit, and don't worry, you won't offend the sensibilities of the cognosceti; they've already moved on to Bushwick. *There is only one chain store on the Bedford commercial district; it's a Duane Reade drugstore that felt compelled to include a microbrew beer bar where locals can refill plastic to-go containers just to earn some street cred. The tactic worked a little bit, but locals still prefer the independently owned King's Pharmacy across the avenue.","Williamsburg, Brooklyn, gets its fair share of criticism .
Some people find it too trendy or played out, but it still has a lot to offer .
Visitors are likely to experience it as eccentric and strangely charming ."
"London (CNN) -- What is the Greece debt deal? Greece, the country at the center of the eurozone debt crisis, pushed through a huge debt swap in March to save it from disorderly default and clear the way to receive its second bailout, worth â‚¬130 billion ($171.5 billion). The country's massive pile of debt has threatened the stability of the 17-country eurozone during a crisis which has dragged on for almost two years. The announcement that Greece successfully pushed through the largest ever sovereign debt restructuring gives some breathing space as the bloc attempts to pull itself back from the brink. In the deal, the country swapped existing bonds for new ones that are worth far less, effectively halving the country's â‚¬206 billion bill to private sector creditors. The restructuring takes pressure off the country in the short term, but as it struggles to rein in huge debts, questions remain over its ability to remain in the eurozone. At the time of the swap, David Watts, of Creditsights, said: ""It seems unlikely that the Greek [debt deal], despite its sizeable writedown, is the last we've seen of Greece in this crisis."" He added, ""there are still questions overhanging the restructuring and further questions over whether this deal makes Greece's debt position sustainable."" Does Greece still face disorderly default? The decision to insert collective action clauses in Greek bonds -- which enabled the country to force through the debt swap against the will of some creditors -- was deemed by ratings agency Standard & Poor's to be a ""selective default."" Investors who hold credit default swaps on the country's debt -- a type of insurance against default -- were paid out following the deal. However, the greater fear has been that Greece will face disorderly default, or a sudden inability to pay its bills. That has been avoided for now, but the country is facing a contracting economy and its debt is currently at 160% of its GDP. Questions are already being raised about the ability for Greece, which is entering its fifth year of recession and struggling under harsh austerity measures, to pull through without further restructuring. An election expected in May is likely to further shine the spotlight on Greece's commitment to the austerity measures which it was forced to implement in exchange for the bailout packages from its eurozone peers and the International Monetary Fund. Throughout the crisis, which was triggered after Greece admitted its finances were far worse than first reported, the country has faced protests on the street and an inability to raise money from investors, leaving it reliant on the bailout funds. Why is Greece still being supported? The financial collapse of a eurozone member is politically and economically charged. The common currency lies at the heart of the ""European dream"" and a disorderly default by one its members would be devastating. So Greece is being supported by its eurozone peers as Europe's leaders, led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, desperately attempt to figure out how to fix the problems. The potential for the crisis to spread to Italy and Spain -- the so-called ""contagion"" effect -- is a powerful incentive to contain the problem. Bailouts of Greece, Ireland and Portugal have created backlashes in countries such as Germany where the prospect of holding up the bloc's far larger economies is economically and politically unpalatable. So what are Europe's leaders doing? Most European leaders have agreed on a fiscal pact which strengthens a financial firewall and is designed to prevent governments running excessive deficits. The â‚¬500 billion permanent bailout fund -- called the European Stability Mechanism -- is being introduced mid year, rather than next year as originally planned. But Europe's leaders have come up with grand plans before and been knocked back by the markets. It remains to be seen if the latest twist in Greece's debt crisis can stem the crisis. Simon Denham, of Capital Spreads, said in a note on the deal: ""Is this the final breaking point in the conversation over Greece? Unfortunately I fear not as we've been here so many times before."" He added, ""the focus is likely to shift onto other parts of the eurozone with Portugal being the main target."" How serious is a default? It depends if it is disorderly, or controlled. The greatest fear has always been a disorderly default, in which Greece would reach a repayment deadline without the funds in hand to pay. There have been numerous grim predictions should this situation eventuate, including global panic and market sell-offs. A default might mean French and German banks exposed to the debt will begin to struggle, resulting in a credit lockdown by the wider banking sector. If banks are forced to take this hit, it could have global economic consequences similar to those seen in the financial crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Investors would also begin looking at which other countries are facing financial difficulties, including Italy and Spain. If investors stop supporting these countries, the eurozone's stronger countries could again be leaned on for financial assistance. But that's where the help from Europe, and further afield, could run out of capacity. Italy's economy, for example, makes up 17% of the eurozone -- nearly seven times bigger than that of Greece. These countries are regarded as ""too big to fail,"" because bailouts would be too expensive. How did we get here? Greece's economy has struggled since the country joined the euro in 2001. In 2004, it admitted its budget deficit was higher than allowed under rules of entry. By 2008 the government had narrowly passed a belt-tightening budget, designed to trim its massive national debt burden, triggering widespread protests. In 2009, Greece admitted its deficit would be more than 12% of gross domestic product -- far higher than previous estimates and more than four times the requirements of entry into the eurozone. The country was hit with ratings downgrades, pushing its sovereign bonds into so-called ""junk"" territory. At the same time, resistance to the austerity measures and a contracting economy have made it extremely difficult for Greece to clamber its way out of the financial problems. Is it time for Greece to drop out of the euro? Despite the relief offered by a second eurozone bailout, Greece is running out of options as pressure grows on its finances. Unless it can make good on massive debts it faces financial collapse, with heavy consequences not only for the eurozone countries but for the global economy. The ECB, IMF and eurozone countries have poured money into Greece to prevent this outcome and may have to continue doing so unless another solution can be found. This has led to calls for Greece to be allowed to quit or be thrown out of the euro. Some Greeks also support this since they believe it would spare them from harsh austerity measures demanded as conditions for assistance. Economists are divided. Many say it is impossible for Greece to drop out because the consequences would be so disastrous that eurozone economies will not allow this to happen. How would quitting the euro affect the Greeks? This would liberate Greece from the eurozone's fixed exchange rate, allowing it to become a more competitive exporter and -- as it unshackles its currency -- an attractively cheap tourist destination. But it would come with a heavy price. It would still leave Greece in debt and reliant on handouts that former eurozone partners would be less willing to supply. It would also mean Greeks would face higher prices for imported goods. It is also likely to drive people out of their homeland as they seek to escape lower wages and higher taxes. This could set back the country's economic recovery back by years.

"London (CNN) -- Fabrice Muamba, the soccer player who collapsed during a game Saturday, may never return to professional football, according to a London heart specialist. In an interview with CNN affiliate ITN, consultant cardiologist Dr. Iqbal Malik, from Hammersmith Hospital, said it was ""very much in doubt"" that he could resume his professional career. The 23-year-old Bolton Wanderers player, originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, is currently in a critical condition at the London Chest Hospital after collapsing during a match with Tottenham Hotspur. Players pray for recovery . Dr. Malik said the treatment he received on the pitch was crucial to his survival, and his chances of making a recovery better than someone who collapses in the street due to the medical facilities at the stadium. ""It's almost the ideal place because of course Premiership players are well looked after so he goes in with very good health and top of that he's being actively watched during the game,"" he said. ""The paramedics arrived immediately, the resuscitation attempt started immediately and the defibrillator -- which is the life-saving maneuver -- happened within a couple of minutes. Within the first three minutes if you can get the heart restarted, then you've got a good chance of survival."" The specialist who works at one of London's heart attack centers said there would now be concern about whether the young footballer had suffered brain damage. ""It may be that because he's young and fit he'll make a great recovery but the question is more about his brain than his heart. I think his heart will recover quickly from this, but has there been enough bloody supply going to his brain during the time of his cardiac arrest to make sure he's neurologically intact? ""We want to see that he wakes up and starts communicating -- that's the next step."" Dr. Malik believes the cardiac arrest was probably caused by an existing condition. ""Despite all of the screening, there is still an instance of about two in 100,000 of this sort of thing occurring. It's much rarer than in the general population because these are fit young guys, but you cannot pick up the subtle abnormalities."" He said the next 48 hours would be crucial.

"(CNN) -- The European economy may be experiencing a downturn, but the continent's wealthiest football clubs have once again bucked the trend according to financial adviser Deloitte. The Football Money League shows that the combined revenue of Europe's top soccer clubs was €4.4 billion ($5.8 billion) for the 2010-11 season, a 3% rise on the previous year. Spanish giants Real Madrid have been named Europe's highest-earning club for the seventh year in a row. The nine-time European champions' revenue of €479.5 million ($635 million) is an increase on €438.6 million for 2009-10. Real's archrivals and reigning Spanish and European champions Barcelona were second on the 20-club list with a revenue of €450.7 million ($597 million). The Madrid giants are closing in on Manchester United's record of topping the list for eight consecutive years. The top six clubs in the money league have remained the same for the fourth year in a row. ""Continued growth of the top 20 clubs during 2010-11 emphasizes the strength of football's top clubs, especially in these tough economic times,"" Deloitte partner Dan Jones said. ""Whilst revenue growth has slowed from 8% in 2009-10 to 3% in 2010-11, their large and loyal supporter bases, ability to drive strong broadcast audiences and continuing attraction to corporate partners has made them relatively resilient to the economic downturn."" England boasted the most teams in the list with a total of six. Premier League champions United were third on the list, having generated €367 million ($486 million), up from €349.8 million. The London duo of Arsenal and Chelsea were fifth and sixth on the list respectively. Arsene Wenger's Arsenal boasted a revenue of €251.1 million ($332 million), down on last year's figure of €274.1 million. Chelsea, backed by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, saw revenue fall from €255.9 million in 2009-10 to €249.8 million ($330 million). The other English clubs on the list were ninth-placed Liverpool (€203.3 million), Tottenham Hotspur in 11th with €181 million and big-spending Premier League leaders Manchester City in 12th on €169.9 million. Four-time European champions Bayern Munich were the leading German club on the list in fourth place having generated €321.4 million ($425 million) -- a small decrease on the previous period. Tenth-placed Schalke, Borussia Dortmund in 16th and Hamburg, 18th, were Germany's other representatives. Five Italian clubs made the top 20 with city rivals AC Milan (€235.1 million) and Inter (€211.4 million) seventh and eighth respectively as both suffered reductions in revenues. Serie A leaders Juventus were 10th with Roma rising three places to 15th and Napoli up to 20th after qualifying for the European Champions League.

"(CNN) -- An Australian businessman pleaded guilty Thursday to strapping a fake bomb around an 18-year-old girl's neck in an attempt to extort money from her family, a court representative said. The guilty plea by Paul Douglas Peters at Sydney Central Local Court is the latest development in a case that grabbed the attention of the international news media last summer. Peters, who is in his 50s, was traced to the United States and arrested in Kentucky, more than 9,000 miles from suburban Sydney where the dramatic events took place in early August. He was extradited back to Australia in September. The authorities say Peters attempted to extort money from Madeleine Pulver's family in the suburb of Mosman by fastening a black box around her neck. In a note, he said the box contained ""powerful new technology plastic explosives"" that would go off if Pulver did not follow his instructions, according to a complaint for provisional arrest filed in U.S. District Court in Louisville, Kentucky. Those instructions included orders to write to an e-mail address and wait for details on handing over an unspecified amount of money. Pulver spent nearly 10 agonizing hours in her bedroom as the authorities tested the box to make sure it would not explode before removing it from her neck. At the same time, the authorities say, Peters was stopping off in his four-wheel-drive Range Rover at a library and video store to check the e-mail account he had given Pulver and whiling away at least part of the time at a liquor store browsing for wine. Peters, who worked in investment banking and law, on Thursday pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offense, a representative of the New South Wales Courts Service Center said. He will be sentenced later this month. Investigators in Australia and the United States say they linked Peters to the e-mail address using video surveillance and access logs, and found credit card records showing that he had purchased a thumb drive, lanyard and baseball bat identical to those used in the extortion attempt, according to the complaint. The document says he sauntered into Pulver's room on August 3, wearing a business shirt, slacks and a blue, yellow and white mask that covered everything but his mouth and a pair of ""saggy and wrinkly"" eyes. He was carrying a backpack and a black aluminum baseball bat. He said he wasn't going to hurt her, then forced a black box around her neck using something like a bike chain and locked it, the complaint said. He attached a lanyard with a green thumb drive and a plastic document sleeve containing a note. ""Count to 200,"" he said, according to the complaint. ""I'll be back."" Pulver waited a few minutes, called out to him but got no response. She contacted her parents and asked for the police. After nearly 10 hours, tests concluded that the device was not a bomb. Peters is a globe-trotting investment banker who went to primary school in Hong Kong, attended college in Sydney, ran investments in Malaysia and spent time in the United States, where his ex-wife and three school-age children live, according to authorities and his attorney.

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Economic opportunity must be a priority if the revolutions sweeping the Middle East and North Africa are to succeed, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Saturday. ""We are making progress politically but more needs to be done economically,"" Clinton told a group of students here. Clinton was on her second visit to Tunisia, the cradle of the Arab Spring which has seen the ouster of long-entrenched leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen. In meetings with Tunisia's president, prime minister and young people, Clinton urged patience on economic and political reform and emphasized that the breakdown of economic systems is ""recipe for frustration and instability that can be exploited by extremists and criminals around the world."" In a town hall with Tunisian students, Clinton spoke about the challenges posed by the so-called ""youth bulge""Â in which the demographics of the world are bending toward a younger population. Three billion people are now under the age of 30 -- 90% of them in the developing world, she noted. She cited estimates that North African and Middle Eastern countries will have to create 50 million jobs over the next decade to meet the needs of young people. ""In every region, responding to the needs and aspirations of young people is a crucial challenge for the future,"" Clinton said.Â ""The world ignores you at its peril."" Clinton was in Tunis for a Friends of Syria meeting in which the international community gathered to discuss ways to end President Bashar al-Assad's bloody crackdown against protesters. She leaves Tunis for Algeria, and then Morocco . Clinton said that while the youth are bearing the brunt of the global economic crisis, they can also help with its recovery. ""Just as you led the way in the revolution here in Tunisia so too must young people lead the way in building vibrant economies,"" she said. Clinton pledged to put youth issues on the international agenda, just as she did for women's rights. The United States, she said, would make the concerns and aspirations of young people a factor in its diplomacy and development work. In the wake of the Arab Spring, United States has announced a massive economic package to help the countries in the region in transition, including trade, investment and entrepreneurship programs. Tunisian youth played a key role in the uprising that ousted former President Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali with the help of the internet and social media to spread their revolutionary message. She urged the audience to hold Tunisia's new Islamic government to their word to embrace freedom of religion and equal rights for women. ""You were fearless on the front lines of the revolution, enduring tear gas and beatings,"" she said. ""Now you are called to be courageous again as the guardians of your new democracy.""","Hillary Clinton speaks to Tunisian students at a town hall .

"(CNN) -- Every syllable that could have possibly been uttered on Rosen v. Romney, the latest offshoot of the demonstrably dopey Democrat-fabricated ""War on Women"" has already been said. So this post is not a reiteration of what every common-sense person knows, regardless of their party affiliation: . First and foremost: Ann Romney is a quiet hero, a woman of indomitable fortitude and the epitome of a proud and productive modern woman; (2) President Barack Obama's policies hurt women equally, if not worse than, all Americans. (3) Whether they work in or out of the home, women have more contact with the real-world everyday problems the president's policies have made worse -- from the rising cost of daily staples -- including but not limited to, energy, groceries and health care premiums -- to the plummeting value of their homes and retirement, to a job-stifling recovery with the velocity of a belly crawl. Rosen: Ann Romney and working moms . And the liberal Potemkin Village philosophy has long been exposed: Liberal feminism is not -- and never has been about -- promoting and effectuating policies that provide options and opportunity for all American women; it has always been about divisive identity politics and mindless, spineless group think. What has been less explored is how Obama Democrats and apparatchiks lack a fundamental ethic of good campaigns, (not to mention, good people): loyalty and dare I say it ... fairness. There are plenty of vicious, hateful, vacuous liberals who regularly vomit venomous, vile diatribes against anyone remotely associated with a conservative thought. Hilary Rosen is not one of those liberals. High ranking among those kind of loudmouth liberals are some of her ""Kumbaya"" comrades who drop-kicked her under an 18-wheeler for uncharacteristically using poorly chosen punditry one-tenth of 1% as egregious as their putrid hourly utterances. Opinion: Not another Mommy War . Rosen is a liberal to be sure, but in my work with her on CNN and when she is a substitute host for Arianna Huffington on our radio show, ""Both Sides Now,"" she is consistently a civil and articulate advocate of her philosophy. She has even been known to concede a capitalist point now and then! Rosen is a big girl and knows politics ain't beanbag, but she deserved some face-saving space and time to come to the only right conclusion -- to apologize to Mrs. Romney for saying she ""had never worked a day in her life"" -- which were she her own client, she would have demanded immediately, as she is one smart cookie. Yet before the commercial break, the Obama high command was in high dudgeon. Let's do a little exercise in decoding Obama-world: Have you ever seen them horsewhip a blundering man with the ferocity they laid into Rosen? A bit of irony in the War on Women world, no? Just for comparison's sake to make my point about the character of an operation, when I made a notoriously stupid blunder (one of too many to count) in the Bush 41 campaign, and the chattering classes' hairs were ablaze demanding my immediate tar-and-feathering, President Bush himself called me and told me to keep fighting, and to make just a tad fewer wild throws; he put out the word that our own staff was to lay off. This is all insider stuff, and likely of little interest to the wider CNN audience, but here is the point, which every political veteran will recognize: The character of a campaign flows from the top; it is a reflection of the values of the leadership. While relentlessly extolling how caring and fair it is about every last citizen, when it came to its own foxhole sister, the Obama team showed its true character. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Matalin.","Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen said Ann Romney had never worked a day in her life .

"(CNN) -- Football clubs and national federations have long been at loggerheads over the balance between domestic and international matches, but Europe's top teams heralded a ""major breakthrough"" on Tuesday. Europe's top soccer clubs and the continent's governing body, UEFA, have announced an agreement which would reduce the amount of international fixtures. The European Club Association (ECA) confirmed UEFA had pledged to amend its football calendar to include nine two-match international breaks over a two-year period rather than the current 12. The agreement would also spell the end of single-match international breaks, such as this week's set of fixtures which features high-profile friendly matches like England's clash with the Netherlands and Germany's home match against France. ""The agreement with UEFA is a major breakthrough for European club football,"" Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, ECA Chairman and CEO of German giants Bayern Munich, said in a statement. ""UEFA clearly recognizes the importance of clubs and the significant contribution they make to the success of national team football. The negotiations have not always proved easy, but were always conducted in a fair and respectful manner. ""This is once more proof that in the European football family solutions can be found in a cooperative and fair way."" Despite UEFA and the ECA finding common ground, the agreement must still be ratified by football's global governing body, FIFA. Rummenigge, a two-time European Footballer of the Year, said talks with FIFA president Sepp Blatter have so far proved unsuccessful. ""While an agreement has been reached with UEFA, the situation remains unsatisfactory in relation to FIFA,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, discussions with the FIFA president have failed to lead to a satisfactory outcome which takes account of the clubs' demands."" The German's comments prompted a response from FIFA, who claimed the issue of the international calendar was up for debate at a meeting on March 5. Football's global governing body also said Rummenigge and other ECA representatives had declined invitations to be part of the discussions. ""FIFA is surprised by recent comments made by ECA stating that they are not satisfied with their discussions,"" read a statement on FIFA's website. ""ECA representatives have previously declined attendance to other FIFA committee meetings, making it very difficult for progress to be made in discussions with the European clubs. ""FIFA remains, as always, willing to discuss with ECA on these topics, as it does with all other stakeholders in the world football community. ""Finally, FIFA would like to recall that the international dates and the international match calendar have to be applied on a worldwide basis and that this calendar is ultimately regulated by FIFA, as football's world governing body."" The agreement would also see UEFA take out insurance aimed at covering players who are injured while on international duty. The insurance would be in place from the forthcoming Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine onwards. If the new rules are put into place, there would be a limit on only one international tournament each year. It also states that the African Cup of Nations must start as early in January as possible in years when it is being held, while other international tournaments must be finished by mid-July.","UEFA and Europe's top football clubs agree to reduce number of international matches .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fierce battles raged Tuesday for control of key Libyan cities in the east and west as Libya entered its fourth week of fighting and continued its descent into civil war. In the eastern oil city of Ras Lanuf, rebels fired antiaircraft guns after Libya's air force carried out fresh raids. Video shot by Sky News showed that fighting was continuing in Zawiya, despite government assertions that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi controlled the oil-refining city. Hundreds of anti-government demonstrators could be seen marching in the street, many of them pumping their fists in the air. As the crackle of gunfire could be heard, the demonstrators ran toward the camera. Four men could be seen carrying a fifth, then putting him into an ambulance. A doctor who left the city in the morning told CNN that Gadhafi forces had fatally shot two fellow doctors in the main square and were shooting wounded civilians rather than allowing them to be treated. The city's two medical clinics were closed, he said. Military casualties were being taken from the city by ambulance, he said. CNN was not able to witness the fighting and could not independently confirm reports of what was happening there on Tuesday. Opposition officials accused Gadhafi of bombing water reserves in Ras Lanuf, the site of intense fighting in recent days. Rebels have seized several cities and the army has fought fiercely to reclaim some of them. On Tuesday, Gadhafi addressed a tribal group of youthful supporters in a talk broadcast on television and repeated his assertions that the nation's youths have been misled and drugged by al Qaeda. ""For them, everybody's their enemy,"" he said. ""They know nothing other than killing."" He praised the Libyan standard of living as one that others in the world envy and called on his countrymen to defend it. ""They want to take your petrol,"" he said. ""This is what America, this is what the French, those colonialists, want."" He cited people from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Algeria as among those who have joined the rebel forces -- ""hunting children who are not mature, who have certain deficiencies; they offer them pills. This is what we understood so far."" He called anti-government forces in Benghazi, a rebel-held town in the east, ""traitors"" and predicted that the pro-Gadhafi residents ""are going to throw them out."" In Gadhafi's stronghold, the capital city of Tripoli, about 100 journalists assembled during the evening in the lobby of a hotel after being told that Gadhafi would arrive. Nine hours later, just before midnight, his convoy of SUVs pulled up to the hotel. Shortly afterward, surrounded by his security detail, he strode into the lobby, waved at the throng of reporters, pumped his right fist several times into the air, retreated to a private room for an interview with a Turkish journalist, then left via a back door without addressing the reporters. The interview was to air Wednesday morning. The incident occurred hours after opposition members denied Tuesday that they have been negotiating an exit deal with Gadhafi, rejecting an assertion made earlier in the day by an opposition official. Gadhafi's regime, too, denied having entered into negotiations with the rebels. Musa Ibrahim, a government spokesman, called reports of such negotiations ""lies."" The Libyan opposition is composed not of a single monolithic group, but of various groups and individuals around the country whose shared goal is to see the 68-year-old ruler ousted. But their military skills tend to be rudimentary, at best, when compared with the relatively disciplined, well-armed pro-Gadhafi forces. ""There is no one here with military experience, but have a strong heart,"" said medical student Yahya Ali, who was manning an antiaircraft battery in the eastern Libyan town of Al-Brega after four hours of training. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said any departure from Libya of Gadhafi would not exempt him, his family or others from responsibility for their actions. ""We are going to hold him accountable,"" Crowley said. U.S. President Barack Obama discussed Libya on Tuesday with British Prime Minister David Cameron, the White House said in a statement. ""They agreed that the common objective in Libya must be an immediate end to brutality and violence; the departure of Gadhafi from power as quickly as possible; and a transition that meets the Libyan peoples' aspirations for freedom, dignity, and a representative government,"" it said. Both leaders agreed to go ahead with planning responses, ""including surveillance, humanitarian assistance, enforcement of the arms embargo, and a no-fly zone."" Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000. ""Both the Libyan government and opposition forces need to allow unhindered access for aid organizations to assist civilians,"" Bill Frelick, refugee program director at Human Rights Watch, said Tuesday. ""People living in areas of heavy fighting in western Libya are now in dire need of medical aid and other assistance."" The U.N. World Food Programme said Tuesday a convoy of trucks entered Libya headed for Benghazi, the rebel stronghold in eastern Libya. ""A convoy of trucks carrying 70 metric tons of high-energy, fortified date bars crossed the Egyptian border last night on its way to Benghazi. This would be the first delivery of food assistance from a U.N. agency to enter the country,"" the organization said in a statement. Plans for more food deliveries are being made, and tons of food have been delivered to the Egyptian border to help feed refugees, the organization said. This is part of a $39.2 million emergency operation designed to help feed more than 1 million people in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia over three months, the group said. Late Monday, the Gulf Cooperation Council said Libya had rejected its offer of humanitarian aid. The council is composed of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. As reports continue to emerge of the government's use of force against civilians, the international community has been left pondering strategies on how to end the violence. Three members of the U.N. Security Council -- France, Britain and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya, diplomatic sources at the United Nations said. And the Gulf Cooperation Council said Monday night they supported such an action. The Organization of the Islamic Conference, which represents 56 member states, said Tuesday that it wants the United Nations to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya. But any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China, two permanent members of the council that wield veto power. Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Karim told CNN on Tuesday that Libya is not misusing its air force and that any no-fly zone would be tantamount to an act of war. He said the Libyan government has asked for international monitors to verify that assertion. He said the military ""are taking purely defensive positions; they are not taking offensive ones"" except in self-defense. The U.S. administration remains reluctant to move forward on a no-fly zone alone. ""Well, we want to see the international community support it,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Sky News on Tuesday. And the United States has also been reluctant to consider using force alone. ""We'd like to see this resolved peacefully,"" Clinton said. ""We'd like to see him go peacefully. We would like to see a new government come peacefully. But if that's not possible, then we're going to work with the international community."" Asked if the United States was considering lifting the arms embargo, she said, ""Well, I think everything is being looked at, but it is difficult in the midst of this civil conflict that is going on now to even know how you would do that, because right now, it's not clear what part of the country is actually under rebel control."" The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Gene Cretz, has met in Rome and Cairo with Libyan opposition figures to get a sense of what is happening in the country, Crowley of the State Department said. He did not give names. Crowley said there have been meetings and phone conversations with members of the National Transitional Council and others. The State Department also spoke Friday with Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa in a brief conversation in which each side gave its view, Crowley said. NATO said it has begun round-the-clock surveillance flights near Libya. With no clear end to the clashes in sight, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli. The fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya, with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave. About 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt, the U.N. refugee agency has said. But 15,000 to 17,000 people are still at a refugee camp near the Libya-Tunisia border. Most of them are from Bangladesh, the U.N. refugee agency said. A man who said he was trapped in Misrata, a city east of Tripoli that has seen heavy clashes, said the rebels were running out of weapons -- but will continue to fight. ""Maybe tomorrow I'll still be alive, I don't know. I have nothing to lose,"" the man said. ""Nobody believes he will be alive tomorrow. Nobody knows. We need support.""

"(CNN) -- Many were in diapers, if they were born at all, during Whitney Houston's heyday in the late 1980s and early 1990s. And yet they still feel a special connection to her -- and, today, share in the heartache of their parents and neighbors by virtue of the fact that they all call northern New Jersey home. Mario Depeine said that students in the public middle school in Newark where he teaches cannot stop talking about Houston, adding they are upset that there is no large-scale public memorial at which they can pay their respects. Most weren't alive when she won her first Grammy Award, in 1986, for best female pop performance for her song ""Saving All My Love For You."" Still, Depeine -- a CNN iReporter -- said the middle-schoolers know Houston's music through their parents as well as her unique place in Newark lore. ""They know her well,"" he said. ""And they realize that she's really connected to this community."" The legendary singer is hardly the first person born in Newark to make a mark on the world. Comedian Jerry Lewis, musician Paul Simon and poet Allen Ginsberg, among many others, arose from the city of about 275,000 people, situated 10 miles west of New York City. Yet Houston has a special connection because -- according to public leaders, family friends and other residents -- she never forgot her roots in Newark, where she was born, and nearby East Orange, where she moved to as a child. Houston family's farewell to be private . ""It's very sad because, in reality, she's a part of here,"" said German Racines. ""She is a little piece of Newark."" Pastor Joe Carter from New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, which Houston attended growing up, recalled how she would come sing at some Easter Sunday services even after she'd made it big. Others recalled fondly how Houston would often return to the area, treating neighbors and fellow church members like family. ""It's almost like she never left,"" said Sharpe James, a former Newark mayor who organized concerts for a young Houston as well as her mother, gospel singer Cissy Houston. ""Here's a superstar, but you could find her in Newark, at the church. She was everywhere and everything to everyone."" Pride tied to her enormous talents, and her fame, are also part of her appeal in the Garden State. Gov. Chris Christie told reporters Tuesday that he believes Houston belongs in the same class as Frank Sinatra, Count Basie and Bruce Springsteen as far as musical luminaries hailing from New Jersey. To pay tribute, he said he plans to order all flags at government buildings be lowered to half-staff Saturday, the day of her funeral. ""Whitney Houston was an important part of the cultural fabric of this state,"" said Christie. ""She was a cultural icon in this state, and her accomplishments in her life were a source of great pride for the people of this state."" For some New Jerseyans, the songstress was an inspiration. That's particularly true at the Whitney E. Houston Academy of Creative and Performing Arts, a school for pre-kindergarten through eighth grade in East Orange, a few blocks from where the singer spent much of her childhood with her parents and two brothers. Tearful students and staff remembered Houston -- a frequent visitor since the school was named in her honor about 15 years ago -- at a memorial event Monday. In addition to speeches and the release of white balloons, her historic rendition of the national anthem before Super Bowl XXV was replayed. Students told CNN affiliate WCBS afterward that Houston's successes prove that there's no limits for a girl from northern New Jersey. ""I think that I can achieve whatever I want, just like she did,"" said eighth-grader Hailey Diasallen. CNN's Maria Santana, Jason Carroll and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.","Whitney Houston was born in Newark in 1963 and later moved to nearby East Orange .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal are backing a ground breaking new scheme to allow their supporters to buy affordable shares in the club and have a greater say over how it is run. The English Premier League club are supporting the ""Arsenal Fanshare"" initiative, which offers the opportunity to purchase shares at a fraction of the normal market rate. Buying one ""fanshare"" will allow a member to quiz Arsenal's directors on key decisions and cast their vote on the direction of the club, similar to how Spanish champions Barcelona are set up. Arsenal Supporters' Trust (AST) has set up the scheme to boost fan representation, and it has now been backed by all four of the north London outfit's major shareholders. Currently, one share in Arsenal costs over $15,000 but ""fanshare"" members can buy them for a hundredth of the price, beginning at a down payment of just $150. Those who sign up can even pay in monthly installments, starting at just $15, and their ""fanshare"" will grant them the rights of a shareholder, including entry to a ballot for a chance to attend the club's annual general meeting. ""The support Arsenal Fanshare has from all of the club's major shareholders should allow all talk of a takeover to be put to one side,"" said Arsenal Fanshare board member and AST spokesman Tim Payton. ""Arsenal Fanshare has been established to increase supporter ownership and representation. ""We urge all Arsenal fans to take this opportunity and get involved - by working together we can make Arsenal even stronger."" At present, 88 per cent of the club is spread between four majority shareholders: American sports tycoon Stan Kroenke, Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov, Danny Fiszman and Lady Bracewell-Smith. Kroenke has repeatedly upped his stake in Arsenal and now stands just ten shares short of 30 per cent - the figure that under UK takeover law would mean he is compelled to make an offer for the remaining shares. AST fights to prevent the club being bought by one wealthy individual and wants supporters to snap up ""fanshares"" that can then be bound together.","Arsenal are backing a new 'fanshare' scheme to get fans more involved in the club .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Gunmen fatally shot an American teacher in the Yemeni province of Taiz on Sunday, two defense ministry officials said. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror network's affiliate in Yemen, claimed responsibility for the killing. In a text message sent to Yemeni media outlets, the group said the victim was spreading Christianity, calling him one of the biggest missionaries in the country. But the International Training and Development Center said the victim, whom it identified as ""Joel S.,"" was not a missionary. ""He was an American development worker who had been working in Yemen with his wife and two children since 2010,"" when he began working for the education center, it said. ""Unfortunately Joel S. has been accused of being a part of a proselytizing campaign, but the staff of ITDC, which consists of Muslims, Christians and other religions working together, has continually focused on human development, skill transfer and community development,"" the center said. ""Joel S. was a very professional employee who highly respected the Islamic religion."" Authorities have not said who killed the teacher. The head of security in the province, Mohamed Saidi, identified him as Joel Shrum. The U.S. Embassy in the capital, Sanaa, said it had heard reports of an American death and was investigating. It did not confirm that an American had been killed. On Thursday, tribesmen demanding the release of prisoners kidnapped a female Swiss teacher in Hodeida on the Red Sea coast, officials said. Imprisoned tribesmen are being held in the Hodeida Central Prison for disturbing travelers and creating roadblocks. In Sunday's attack, two men on a motorcycle fired eight shots at the teacher, who was on his way to work at a Swedish language center in the provincial capital, the defense ministry officials said. ""We are investigating the killing as this is the first of its kind against a western national in Taiz,"" one of the defense officials said. Neither wanted to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. Yemen has been fighting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for years, with mixed results. In September, a CIA-operated drone attack in Yemen killed American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, the external operations commander and chief recruiter of English-speaking militants for the group. While the death may reduce al Qaeda's ability to plan attacks, the group still poses a danger and ""remains the node most likely to attempt transnational attacks,"" according to the annual U.S. intelligence community's threat assessment, released in January. Yemen said Sunday that it had killed 14 suspected militants in the south of the country. The al Qaeda suspects were killed in the town of Jaar in Abyan when government forces attacked militant hideouts using air raids and tanks, two security officials in Abyan said. The Yemeni navy also participated in the attack, bombarding Jaar for three hours Sunday morning. No soldiers were killed in the attacks, three government officials said. Two security officials in Abyan said that the attacks were carried out by Yemeni forces targeting weapons caches in Jaar. ""The attacks on al Qaeda hideouts will not stop against the terrorists in Jaar until they surrender,"" one official said. The towns of Dofas, Zinjibar and al-Kod were also raided by the Yemen air force. Residents in Jaar said the militants told them to not leave their homes under any circumstances. ""Ansar al-Sharia called out in the morning that anyone leaving their homes will be at risk. The government raids today targeted a number of residential areas,"" said Salem Juhaif, a resident of Jaar. Ansar al-Sharia is a separate Islamist militia allied with al Qaeda. Yemen has been beset by political turbulence since the beginning of last year. Protests led to the departure of President Ali Abdullah Saleh from office. His successor, President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi, declared Saturday that people killed in peaceful protests against Saleh were ""martyrs"" -- a religious term elevating their status -- and that their families will receive compensation. People wounded in the protests will be offered health care at the government's expense, his presidential decree said. CNN's Samira Said contributed to this report.","The victim's employer says the American was not a missionary .

"(CNN) -- A last minute Thomas Vermaelen goal gave Arsenal a vital 2-1 Premier League home win over Newcastle on Monday, a result that closes the gap on third-placed Tottenham to just a single point. Central defender Vermaelen pounced from close range to finally end the resistance of a stubborn Newcastle side who had defended superbly in an absorbing encounter. Arsenal enjoyed the majority of possession but it was Newcastle who opened the scoring in the 14th minute when Hatem Ben Arfa cut inside from the right and fizzed in a low shot that beat goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny at his near post. But, within a minute, Arsenal had drawn level and yet again it was Robin van Persie who scored for the Gunners. The Premier League's top scorer produced great skill to hold off defender Mike Williamson before firing home his 26th league goal of the season and 33rd in all competitions. Arsenal continued to pose the bigger threat after the break, although Newcastle looked dangerous on the counter-attack. Tomas Rosicky nearly celebrated signing a new Arsenal contract when firing wide from close range, while substitute Gervinho somehow missed the Newcastle goal from six yards out. Then Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul pulled off a brilliant save to tip over a powerful Vermaelen header. But Vermaelen was not to be denied and, with just a minute of injury time remaining, Arsenal broke clear through Theo Walcott, and the England international's cross was met by his Belgian teammate who had made a 50-yard run to get into the penalty area. Arsenal, who also became the first team in Premier League history to win four games in a row after conceding the opening goal, are now three points ahead of Chelsea in the race for fourth place, with Newcastle a further five points behind in sixth place. Elsewhere in Europe, Getafe secured their first Spanish Primera Liga win since January with a 2-1 success at struggling Villarreal. Goals from Diego Castro and Abdelaziz Barrada proved enough for the Madrid-based side, who are now up to 13th in the table, while Villarreal remain just three points above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven have dismissed coach Fred Rutten following a run of three straight defeats. Rutten, who took over as coach in April 2009, is replaced by his assistant Phillip Cocu until the end of the season, after recent losses to FC Twente (6-2), Valencia (4-2) and NAC Breda (3-1).","A last minute Thomas Vermaelen goal sees Arsenal defeat Newcastle 2-1 .

"(CNN) -- Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords announced she will resign from Congress this week -- but not before finishing her ""Congress On Your Corner"" event that was interrupted by the shooting rampage that left six people dead and Giffords with a gunshot wound to her head. At the private gathering Monday, Giffords will meet with some of the people who were at the event last year, including some who aided injured people and some who subdued the gunman, according to a statement from her office. ""A lot has happened over the past year. We cannot change that,"" Giffords, 41, says in a video on her website, speaking in a halting manner. She said she will resign to continue her recuperation from the brain injury she suffered when she was shot on January 8, 2011. ""I don't remember much from that horrible day, but I will never forget the trust you placed in me to be your voice,"" Giffords continues. ""Thank you for your prayers and for giving me time to recover. I have more work to do on my recovery. So to do what is best for Arizona, I will step down this week."" Giffords, a Democrat, will submit a letter of resignation during the week to House Speaker John Boehner and Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. Brewer told reporters Sunday that within 72 hours of receiving that resignation, she expects to call a primary election sometime in April for political parties to pick their candidates for the state's 8th congressional district seat. That would be followed by a general election -- likely in June, according to the governor. The winner will head to Congress for the rest of Giffords' term, which ends in January 2013. ""Her recovery has been nothing less than a miracle,"" said Brewer, noting she spoke with Giffords' husband Mark Kelly earlier Sunday about the decision. ""Who knows what's going to happen in the next two years. I don't believe we've seen the last of Gabby Giffords."" Before she steps down, Giffords will attend the State of the Union address Tuesday in Washington, her office said in a statement. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic National Committee chair, told CNN that Giffords -- a close friend -- came to the conclusion that she couldn't devote her full energies to both her job and her recovery. The congressman's recent return to Tucson for the one-year anniversary of the shooting showed her ""how challenging it would be. It came into focus then,"" her friend said. ""This decision is really quintessential Gabby Giffords,"" Wasserman Schultz added. ""She needed to step aside for herself, so that her constituents could get full-time representation. She cares about them so much, that was her number one priority -- taking care of them."" President Barack Obama was effusive in his praise for the congresswoman, saying Giffords ""embodies the very best of what public service should be."" He added that her ""cheerful presence will be missed in Washington (and) she will remain an inspiration to all whose lives she touched -- myself included."" ""Over the last year, Gabby and her husband Mark have taught us the true meaning of hope in the face of despair, determination in the face of terrible odds, and now -- even after she's come so far -- Gabby shows us what it means to be selfless as well,"" Obama said in a statement. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said that Giffords ""will be missed."" And Brewer, the Arizona governor, lauded Giffords as a ""noble public servant ... and a model of what can be accomplished with persistence and determination."" House Democratic leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, called Giffords a ""bright star"" whose ""message of bipartisanship and civility is one that all in Washington and the nation should honor and emulate."" ""Her legacy in the Congress and her leadership for our nation will certainly continue,"" Pelosi said in a statement. In her website video posted Sunday, Giffords says her public service career has not ended. ""I will return, and we will work together for Arizona and this great country,"" she says. Earlier this month, Giffords joined thousands for a vigil in Tucson, one of several emotional events over the weekend to mark one year since the shootings. In addition to those killed, 13 people were injured in the shooting. Prosecutors accuse Jared Lee Loughner, 23, of carrying out the attack, which purportedly targeted Giffords during the constituent meet-and-greet event outside a supermarket. Giffords is still recovering from her injuries, and her right side remains weak. She has made few public appearances since the incident with some rare exceptions, such as casting a vote in Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling and conducting an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer. She has been undergoing intensive rehabilitation in Houston, Texas, but returned to Tucson several times, according to her office. Pia Carusone, the congresswoman's chief of staff, said recently that Giffords had steadily increased her workload as her condition improved. ""As the year wore on, we were able to plug the congresswoman in more,"" Carusone said. ""Now we talk regularly over video chats and telephone. She's gotten more and more involved the better she gets."" Still, Wasserman Schultz said Sunday night that Giffords now realizes that ""her recovery now is more likely to stretch into years, rather than months."" ""I know she's coming back; she wants to come back to public service,"" the Florida congresswoman said, adding that Giffords is stepping down thinking ""it's better to focus on coming 100% back."" Loughner, the man accused of targeting her last year outside a Tucson supermarket, potentially faces the death penalty if convicted on charges of murdering six people -- including the chief federal judge of Arizona, John Roll. Loughner has been diagnosed as schizophrenic and has spent time on suicide watch while in custody and is undergoing treatment in Springfield, Missouri. A federal appeals court in May cleared the way for him to be forcibly medicated over the objections of Loughner and his attorney. Giffords herself worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers and as CEO of El Campo Tire, her family's business, before being elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2000. Two years later, she became the youngest woman elected to the Arizona state senate. She won a November 2006 election to earn her spot in the U.S. Congress, then captured two other terms. Kelly, her husband, is a retired Navy captain and astronaut. A flood of people posted comments on Giffords' Facebook page Sunday under her video -- praising the congresswoman for her courage, voicing their continued support and expressing hope that she'll one day return to public office. One person wrote, ""I am so thankful you are taking care of you. We can wait."" Another commenter called Giffords an ""inspiration"" and a ""great example."" ""It's so sad to see you leave but I know we'll see you back soon. Be well. You are loved,"" he wrote.

"(CNN) -- Months after his first trial ended in a hung jury, Jason Young was convicted Monday by a North Carolina jury of first-degree murder in the beating death of his pregnant wife. Michelle Young was discovered dead in 2006 in the bedroom of her Raleigh home. Her husband, Jason, first went on trial last June but a jury could not unanimously agree on a verdict. But that was not the case Monday, when several of Michelle Young's relatives embraced and wiped away tears after this jury's decision was announced. Afterward, Judge Donald Stephens said he had no reason to set aside the verdict and ordered Young to be sentenced to life in prison without chance of parole. According to Stephens, Michelle Young ""wasn't just murdered, she suffered a beating the likes of which we seldom see."" Jason Young, now 37, struck her over 30 times, seemingly only stopping after ""he was exhausted,"" said the judge. ""The evidence suggests that the assailant was overcome completely by anger and rage,"" the judge added. ""And even then, he had the energy to strip her of her engagement and weddings rings because, in his mind, she was unworthy of wearing them."" Saying the ""fingerprints of domestic violence are all over this case,"" Stephens said Jason Young ""had not only a motive"" to kill his wife ""but the circumstances pointed directly to him."" Meredith Fisher, the victim's sister, said she answered a call from Jason Young requesting that she drop by his home to pick up some computer printouts that ""were said to have been ... a belated anniversary gift,"" according to a search warrant. After entering the Raleigh home on November 3, 2006, Fisher found her bloodied sister dead on her bedroom floor as well as the victim's daughter alive on the other side of the bedroom. The defense contended Jason Young first learned about his wife's death later that day at his mother's home in Brevard, North Carolina, and was contacted by an investigator as he was heading back to Raleigh. Another search warrant said that Jason Young hung up on a phone call from a detective, and, ""He refused to come to the scene or to continue speaking with investigators. Mr. Young did not inquire as to his daughter's well-being or to the nature and/or cause of his wife's death."" The defense had argued that intruders, and not the defendant, had killed Michelle Young. They pointed to what they described as holes in the prosecution's case -- including the lack of blood in Jason Young's car and on the jeans he supposedly wore the night his wife died. ""There may have been two killers in the house. But neither of them was Jason Young,"" argued defense attorney Bryan Collins. ""This case is awful, it's sad, it's heavy, it weighs on you. And yet that has nothing to do with who killed her."" Wake County Assistant District Attorney Howard Cummings, meanwhile, said Michelle Young died as a result was a purposeful killing and not a violent theft. ""This is not a stranger crime,"" the prosecutor said. ""This is an act of domestic violence that had been coming on.""","NEW: The victim's family embraces and cries after the verdict is announced .

"(CNN) -- Branden Grace stepped up his bid for back-to-back tournament wins by taking a four-shot lead at the halfway stage of the Volvo Golf Champions tournament at The Links at Fancourt Friday. The 23-year-old South African carded a seven-under-par 66 to set the pace on 12-under 134 after two rounds. Compatriot Thomas Aiken, who shot 70, and England's Lee Slattery, who raced up the field with a best-of-the-day 65, are his nearest challengers. European Ryder Cup captain Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain showed he is still a force at 45 with an impressive 68 to be alone on fourth on 139. Grace only received an invitation to the 35-strong champions-only field by winning last week's Joburg Open and has seized his opportunity in fine style. He was paired with first round leader Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium, who crashed to a 76 to fall six shots off the pace. Home favorite Ernie Els, fellow three-time major winner Padraig Harrington of Ireland and reigning British Open champion Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland are eight shots off the blistering pace being set by Grace. Meanwhile, Colombia's Camilo Villegas and David Toms of the United Stages led after the first round of the PGA Tour's $5.6 million Humana Challenge in California. Villegas carded his nine-under 63 on the Nicklaus Private Course and Toms matched him at La Quinta Country Club. South Korean rooke Bae Sang-moon was in the chasing group on 64 with Ted Potter, Brandt Snedeker and Bob Estes. Toms played with star attraction Phil Mickelson, who struggled to a two-over 74 after a triple-bogey seven at the par-four 14th, on the toughest of the three courses used for the tournament. Former U.S. president Bill Clinton, who is set to play with Australian veteran Greg Norman Saturday in the revised pro-am format, was among the watching crowd Thursday. Norman, making his first start on the regular tour since 2009, carded a 72.","Branden Grace leads Volvo Golf Champions event at Fancourt by four shots .

"(CNN) -- Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, a long-time Italian politician who served as the European nation's president for much of the 1990s, has died, the Italian government announced Sunday. He was 93. Italy's current president, Giorgio Napolitano, fondly recalled Scalfaro's time as a member of parliament, interior minister and eventually president. ""Scalfaro has been a leading figure of the democratic political life in the various decades of the republic, a perfect example of coherence and moral integrity,"" Napolitano said in a statement. Prime Minister Mario Monti lauded Scalfaro for having ""consistently defended the fundamental values of the republic, set out in the constitution."" ""He has been a distinguished protagonist of ... Italian political and institutional life and (a) luminous example of perfect consistency and integrity,"" Monti said in a statement. Pope Benedict XVI described Scalfaro as ""an illustrious Catholic statesman,"" according to a news release on the Vatican's website. In condolences sent to Scalfaro's daughter, he said the former Italian president ""did his best to promote the common good and the perennial ethical and religious values, that is proper to Italy's historical and civic tradition."" Joining Italy's legislature in 1946, soon after the end of World War II, Scalfaro served as minister and secretary on multiple occasions. In 1992, he became the parliamentary speaker -- then, a month later, he became president. Scalfaro remained in that post for a seven-year term. He served in a time of political instability in Italy, facing regular calls for new elections and working with several prime ministers, including Giuliano Amato, Romano Prodi and Silvio Berlusconi -- all of whom ended up serving additional terms later. In 1999, Scalfaro handed over the reins as president to Carlo Ciampi.","NEW: Prime Minister Monti calls Scalfaro an ""example of perfect consistency and integrity""

"(CNN) -- South African golfer Branden Grace claimed the first European Tour success of his career on Sunday after holding off Jamie Elson by one shot to win the Joburg Open. The 23-year-old Grace, who came through qualifying school last year to secure his tour card, posted a level par 72 for a 72-hole total of 270 (-18). And that proved just enough to keep Elson at bay, after the Englishman replicated his opening round 63 to come agonizingly close to ending his European Tour drought. New heart gives golfer new hope . It was a solid, if unspectacular, display from Grace, who held a three-stroke lead overnight. In the end, a round consisting of 16 pars, with just one birdie and one bogey, proved enough for the Pretoria player, despite Elson's valiant effort to snatch victory. ""It's a dream come true,"" Grace told the European Tour website. ""It's nice to win in front of a home crowd and I wouldn't exchange it for anything else. ""It was pretty tough out there today, I played really nicely and I hit the ball superbly. But my putter was cold -- I just couldn't get the speed of the greens -- and fortunately it was still enough to win."" Six players shared third place, with Scotland's David Drysdale (67) carding the best round of that group.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Imagine every time you closed your curtains, you were capturing enough solar energy to power your laptop. The technology is available, but no one's packaged it up in a handy DIY kit at your local hardware store. Solar textiles use the same technology as traditional solar panels to convert sunlight into energy. Sheila Kennedy hopes to be the first. She's not an interior designer but an architect and professor in practice at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is convinced that solar textiles will revolutionize the way we collect and consume power. ""I've been thinking about what happens when power and light become flexible, literally flexible,"" she said. She calls it ""soft power,"" as in the ""soft energy path,"" a term coined Amory Lovins in the 1970s as a way to describe a world where renewable energy would gradually replace the centralized grid. Later, Joseph Nye used the term ""soft power"" to describe the ability of persuasion, values and culture to influence change. Kennedy's work with soft power builds on both of these ideas. For her , soft power is the ability of flexible materials to convert sunlight into energy. ""The soft power approach says there are some incredibly sensual, compelling, beautiful spaces and products that we can be producing using these emerging energy-harvesting materials,"" Kennedy said. Her Boston-based firm, Kennedy & Violich Architecture, has been working with thin-film photovoltaic material, a fabric that looks and moves like cloth but does the job of a solar panel. ""These are materials which can be prepared in the chemistry lab or can be found in nature. They produce electricity when exposed to light. They are very efficient and flexible,"" she said. ""We are pairing the thin-film photovoltaic material with another semi-conductor material, the light-emitting diode; they're two sides of the same coin. One takes a little bit of the energy of sunlight and transforms it into electricity; some takes that electricity and turns it into light."" Rechargeable batteries pocketed into the hem of the curtains gather energy that can be downloaded into a larger home battery. ""From a technical view, the thin-film has the potential to be produced in very high volumes, with a very low embodied energy and a low carbon footprint. These new photovoltaic materials can be produced in the same way one might print and produce a newspaper, roll to roll. That can make it very affordable,"" Kennedy said. Its limitations are its performance. It's less efficient that glass-based solar technology, but Kennedy predicts that's going to change. ""Right now there's research being done on developing sensitivities in thin-film that will allow the energy to continue to be harvested, even at night. That's going to revolutionize the applications for solar textiles,"" she said. The current technology can be found hanging in the Vitra Design Museum in Essen, Germany, in a prototype pre-fabricated home called the Soft House. Farther south and west, the designers are taking their ideas from the Soft House and applying them to a research project for a Soft City. Kennedy and her team have calculated that by covering just 10 percent of a roof area in Porto, Portugal, solar curtains could provide as much as 70 percent of the average electricity used by a typical household each day. ""It goes to show that you don't need a very large area. We've calculated that 15 square meters would be enough."" Kennedy envisions a future in which a single homeowner or a group of neighbors would decide to wean themselves off the centralized grid and power their homes using the energy they've ""harvested"" themselves from the sun. ""You could look at it as a type of urban farming,"" Kennedy suggested, adding that one of the reasons people aren't doing it now is not the lack of technology but old habits and inherited centralized building systems in architecture. ""Instead of tucking way electricity and lights in walls and accessing that with a plug, we have the possibility of thinking of a whole new experience for energy, energy-harvesting and for light."" She talks about material that you could reel in from the roof and wrap around to make a new type of instant room, a Zip Room. Plastic wall plugs would cease to exist; instead you'd harness your appliance into the surface or edge of the textile. Her ideas may seem radical to homeowners who don't give much thought to where their power comes from or how much it costs, which is why Kennedy is so keen to see the solar curtains in consumer-friendly packs on hardware store shelves. ""Energy-harvesting solar textiles are a very good beginning point. I think that the notion of tying in a new technology with something very familiar really has its advantages if one's about large-scale uptake and widespread adoption of a new energy regime."" Regime may sound like a hard word to be used in the context of soft power, but as Kennedy says, it's up to architects and designers to convince homeowners that there are more efficient alternatives to traditional homes. Her firm is going one step further with the offer to work with developers and manufacturers who are interested in building digitally fabricated Soft House demonstration projects. ""My team is actively interested in speaking to people who are serious about realizing a pilot program that adapts the Soft House model to actual needs on urban or rural sites. I do think the moment is now.""","Solar-harvesting curtains could convert sunlight into power source for homes .

"(Financial Times) -- Three of the most powerful officials in Angola have held concealed interests in an oil venture with Cobalt International Energy, the Goldman Sachs-backed explorer whose operations in one of the world's most promising energy frontiers are under investigation by US authorities, the Financial Times has learned. The recently departed head of the national oil company and an influential general confirmed to the FT last week that they and another general have held shares in Nazaki Oil and GÃ¡z, the local partner in a Cobalt-led deepwater venture launched in early 2010. Warning its shareholders that it might face liabilities under US anti-corruption laws, Houston-based Cobalt said in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice were investigating its Angolan operations. The three men's previously opaque shareholdings in Cobalt's local partner could raise questions about compliance with US anti-corruption law, which makes it a crime to pay or offer anything of value to foreign officials to win business. Manuel Vicente, who was the head of state-owned Sonangol until his appointment in January as minister of state for economic co-ordination, and General Manuel HÃ©lder Vieira Dias JÃºnior, known as Kopelipa, the head of the presidency's military bureau, confirmed their holdings in Nazaki in near-identical letters. As head of Sonangol, Mr Vicente oversaw Africa's second-biggest oil industry. Asked whether they had exerted any influence over the award of Cobalt's oil rights, Mr Vicente and Gen Kopelipa denied wrongdoing. They said they had held their Nazaki interests ""always respecting all Angolan legislation applicable to such activities, not having committed any crime of abuse of power and/or trafficking of influence to obtain illicit shareholder advantages"". They said their interests and those of General Leopoldino Fragoso do Nascimento were held through Grupo Aquattro Internacional. Aquattro is named as a Nazaki shareholder in two company documents from 2007 and 2010 obtained by the FT. They said Aquattro had been ""recently dissolved"" but did not say whether they had disposed of their interests in Nazaki. Gen Fragoso do Nascimento, a former head of communications in the presidency, did not respond to requests for comment. Mr Vicente and Gen Kopelipa added: ""Should the continued operation of Cobalt in the Angolan petroleum sector be unviable as a result of any failure to comply with any American law, there will certainly be [Angolan] and/or foreign entities interested in substituting for it in the assets it owns in Angola."" Gen Kopelipa added that ""that hopefully will not happen"". Responding to FT inquiries about the three officials, Cobalt stressed that its extensive and ongoing due diligence ""has not found any credible support for [the] central allegation that Angolan government officials, and specifically the officials identified . . . have any ownership in Nazaki"". It would be happy to review any proof. ""Cobalt has at all times complied fully with both US and Angolan laws,"" it said. Nazaki, which did not respond to a request for comment, denied the allegation, Cobalt said. Goldman, one of Cobalt's founding investors and its biggest shareholder, declined to comment, as did the SEC and DoJ. Sonangol did not respond to requests for comment. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Three powerful officials in Angola have held concealed interests in an oil venture .

"(Financial Times) -- The chief executive of BTG Pactual has been fined for insider trading by Italian regulators in a move that has forced the rapidly growing Brazilian investment bank to amend the prospectus for its high-profile listing next week. Consob, the Italian financial watchdog, imposed a €350,000 fine and a six-month ban from senior positions at Italian companies on André Esteves for a purchase of shares worth €3.4m in beef producer Cremonini five years ago. The news marked a blow for the Rio de Janeiro-based bank just as it is gearing up for a public offering next week that values it at up to $15bn, making it the first significant IPO in Brazil in more than nine months. BTG Pactual said Mr Esteves was informed on April 13 of the result of the Consob investigation and had decided to appeal. ""This decision is still subject to appeal in the administrative domain and, by its nature, does not include any consequences in the criminal domain,"" the investment bank said. Italy's Consob, which in February ordered the seizure of €4.2m of Mr Esteves' assets, said the 43-year-old Latin American banker bought the shares in November 2007 knowing that the group was planning to enter a joint venture with Brazilian rival JBS. The joint venture was announced in December 2007 but has since collapsed amid acrimony between the two companies. The bank had mentioned ""ongoing civil, non-criminal investigation in Europe"" against Mr Esteves in its IPO prospectus published at the beginning of the month, without providing any detail at the time. In that prospectus, the bank said that regardless of the investigation's outcome, it did not believe there would be an adverse effect on BTG Pactual, including on the capacity of Mr Esteves to serve in his present roles. In 2007, Mr Esteves, who ranks as Brazil's 13th-richest individual, was employed by UBS where he worked as global head of fixed income after selling BTG Pactual to the Swiss bank for $2.5bn when he was just 37 years old. Mr Esteves bought BTG Pactual back from UBS in 2009 after the onset of the financial crisis, selling a stake in the firm the following year to three sovereign wealth funds that valued it at about $10bn. BTG Pactual declined to comment on the Consob fine. But people close to Latin America's largest independent investment bank said the fine affected neither the bank nor the IPO. ""This is a bit embarrassing but it is irrelevant and essentially without merit,"" one person said. The planned flotation on April 26 will value Mr Esteves's stake at up to $5bn and will show that 35 other senior partners own stakes worth more than $150m each. But Mr Esteves and his partners will not use the IPO to cash out of the company. After the listing, the partners will only trade shares among themselves and not sell them on the public market. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","The chief executive, André Esteves, of BTG Pactual has been fined for insider trading .

"(CNN) -- Revelers in Brazil's most famous city will enjoy more than just sun, live music and dancing when Carinval festivities start this week. Rio de Janeiro state officials are also giving away 3 million free condoms. The new government initiative aims to stop the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases during the five-day event, the state health department said. This year's campaign targets gay men between the ages of 19 and 24, Brazilian Health Minister Alexandre Padilha said, according to state-run Agencia Brasil. ""There is a new generation that has not had the experience of seeing idols who fought at the beginning of the AIDS (epidemic) and who died, and therefore (they) are less sensitive to the risks of HIV infection,"" Padilha said, referring to two Brazilian rock stars who died of AIDS in the 1990s. In addition to condoms, health officials also plan to hand out 330,000 paper fans with catchy slogans against STDs, 55,000 small bags party-goers can use to carry condoms and more than 160,000 informational pamphlets to crowds at samba dance performances and block parties during the legendary annual celebration. Other major cities in the country will have similar programs, according to Agencia Brasil. Sao Paulo, Salvador and Florianopolis have entered into partnerships with block parties and artists. Tents also will be set up throughout the cities to perform rapid testing for HIV and hepatitis. Despite widespread awareness of condoms, 40% of young people in Brazil do not use condoms in all sexual relations, according to the health department.","Rio de Janeiro state officials are giving away 3 million free condoms .

"(CNN) -- A 25-year-old woman has been charged with first-degree murder in the California death of a deployed Marine's wife, San Diego County authorities said Friday. Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, was being held Friday after she pleaded not guilty at her arraignment a day earlier and her bail was set at $3 million, said Steve Walker, a spokesman for the San Diego County district attorney. The investigation into the murder of Brittany Killgore, 22, is ongoing and additional charges could be filed, Walker told CNN Friday. Marine Staff Sgt. Luis Ray Perez, 45, who was on a date with Killgore when she was last seen alive a week ago, was charged earlier this week with two felonies unrelated to Killgore's death -- receiving stolen property and possession of an assault weapon -- and he has pleaded not guilty, authorities said. If convicted, Lopez would face 25 years to life in prison; Perez would face up to three years if convicted, Walker said. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department said this week that Perez was being ""actively investigated"" in connection with Killgore's death. ""We believe he knows more than what he initially told us,"" said Sheriff's Capt. Duncan Fraser. ""We do not believe he is being cooperative with us."" Killgore, 22, was seen last Friday night when she left her apartment wearing an evening dress, heading out on the date with Perez, who is based at Camp Pendleton in San Diego County, investigators said. Perez was questioned after a friend filed a missing person report for Killgore and he was later arrested on charges of possession of a stolen assault rifle, authorities said. Investigators later found Killgore's body in a rural part of neighboring Riverside County. Authorities have not said how she died. Lopez's relationship to Killgore has been unclear. CNN affiliate KGTV in San Diego reported that authorities found Killgore's body based on leads stemming from Lopez's arrest. Lopez was found at a Ramada motel near the San Diego airport Tuesday after paramedics responded to a call for medical help. She was briefly hospitalized with lacerations and then jailed on suspicion of Killgore's murder. Killgore had recently filed for divorce from her husband, Marine Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore, who was serving with an artillery unit in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, investigators said. He was granted an emergency leave to return to the United States when he learned his wife was missing. San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie M. Dumanis issued a statement saying: ""This is an ongoing investigation and, as the county's top prosecutor, my responsibility is to protect the integrity of the case, ensure a thorough investigation, and ultimately hold those responsible in a court of law.""","Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, pleads not guilty to a murder charge in San Diego County .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Two Brazilian tourists, their guide and a police officer who were kidnapped by Bedouin tribesmen in Egypt's southern Sinai Peninsula all have been freed, an Interior Ministry spokesman said Monday. Interior Ministry spokesman Alaa Mahmoud on Sunday said that the tourist and their guide had been released. The whereabouts of the officer had been unclear. Provincial officials said that an ""unknown armed group"" had stopped the tourists' bus near the Greek Orthodox monastery of St. Catherine's and taken the two Brazilians and the guide hostage, according to the state-run Egypt New Agency. That report did not mention a police officer being kidnapped. The kidnappers then demanded the release of Bedouin prisoners jailed under longtime Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak, as well as the cancellation of sentences handed down in absentia. But a security official in southern Sinai said that the the tourists and their guide were released late Sunday without any of those demands being met, according to the official Egypt News Agency report. Instead, the kidnappers heeded calls from Bedouin tribal leaders to let them go free, said the official. There was no immediate word on the status of the police officer who the Interior Ministry spokesman had also reported kidnapped. The southern Sinai Peninsula has seen a rash of kidnappings in recent months, including the brief abduction of two American tourists in February and the seizure of two dozen Chinese workers and a translator in late January. Kidnappings and daylight robberies have become increasingly common in the turbulent year since Mubarak's overthrow in February 2011, with several wealthy Egyptians among those targeted by hostage-takers demanding ransom.","NEW: All four kidnap victims were freed, Interior Ministry spokesman says .

If he doesn't show up in court, we will move to hold him in contempt. That's the difficult part of this process."" Ozment's whereabouts had been unknown since his mother picked him up on January 8 after his release. Ozment is one of four convicted murderers Barbour pardoned this month. The others are: David Gatlin, Charles Hooker and Anthony McCray. Ozment did not appear at a court hearing in a case challenging the pardons. This week, a Jackson, Mississippi, judge is expected to hear the case again. If Ozment does not appear, the judge can hold him in contempt, Hood said. As he closed out his second term as governor, Barbour granted ""full pardons"" -- meaning the convict's record is effectively wiped clean -- to more than 200 people found guilty of a variety of crimes. All four of the convicted murderers he pardoned were serving life sentences and worked as trusties at the governor's mansion. The move stirred outrage among relatives of the pardoned murderers' victims. ""It's just an every minute, constant, in the back of your mind, where is he? What is he doing?"" said Mary McAbee, sister of Rick Montgomery, a store clerk shot to death by Ozment in 1992. Ozment pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. ""I'm fearful. He's a cold-blooded murderer to do what he's done, and if he thinks that he may go back to prison. What's he got to lose?"" she said. Also concerned is Tiffany Ellis Brewer, whose sister was shot and killed by David Gatlin. Gatlin walked into a trailer in 1993 where his estranged wife, Tammy Gatlin, lived and shot her in the head as she held their 6-week-old baby in her arms. Brewer said she wants her sister's killer back in prison. ""He got life plus 30 years, you know? And he served 18 of them. My sister lived 20 years. It's ridiculous,"" she said. Late Monday, Hood spoke to CNN's ""AC360,"" slamming Barbour and questioning the motives behind his pardons. ""He ran the office of the governor as if it was Mississippi in the 1950s,"" said Hood. The attorney general, a Democrat, said many of the inmates Barbour, a Republican, pardoned came from influential families or had connections to the Republican party. ""There's not any logical explanation other than it was just a whim, and by doing it on a whim at the last moment that's how he violated our Constitution,"" Hood said. Barbour has defended his pardons. On Friday, he appeared on CNN's ""John King USA,"" saying Ozment and the others have been rehabilitated. ""He has no obligation to do anything. He's been pardoned. He's a free man,"" Barbour said. Authorities found Ozment at a hotel in Laramie, Wyoming, on Monday. He had been staying under another name. CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Daytime TV doyenne Oprah Winfrey said Friday she is ""100%"" behind President Obama as he campaigns for re-election this year -- and that the man she backed four years ago for president is doing a great job. Winfrey made the comments in a wide-ranging interview with CNN in South Africa, where she is marking the graduation of the first students to join the academy she set up five years ago. Seventy-two students, known as ""the pioneers,"" will graduate Saturday from the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls, watched by the school's founder. The talk-show host opened the school in January 2007 to provide educational opportunities for impoverished girls in South Africa. In a post on her Facebook page Thursday, Winfrey said: ""I am one proud Mama."" The graduation ceremony will be a first for the school, she said, before the students ""go their separate ways to colleges all over South Africa and the U.S. A bittersweet day to bask in all the memories of the past five years."" The school has faced a number of challenges over the years, including complaints of abuse against a dormitory matron -- who was later cleared -- and a police investigation into a student last year after an infant's body was found. But Winfrey emphasized the achievements of the school's 400 pupils, saying the word ""disadvantaged"" had been eliminated so that no-one would lower their expectations for the girls. This time four years ago, Winfrey was also helping raise expectations for Obama as he battled for the 2008 Democratic nomination, appearing alongside him at campaign events in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Asked about her support for Obama this time around, Winfrey said she had not felt the need to formally endorse him for 2012 because he is now well known to everyone. ""I don't need to endorse him because I am a 100% supporter of him and I've already endorsed him,"" she said. ""If he or his office called me tomorrow and said that they needed me I would do whatever I thought would be of service. I did what I did in 2008 because I really thought that would be of value and of service. I don't think that's needed in 2012. There's not a person in the world who doesn't know who Barack Obama is."" Winfrey urges people not to forget how dire the economic outlook was when Obama first took the reins when they assess how well he is doing in the White House. She says she is confident Obama will be re-elected, adding, ""I think he is a masterful leader."" And his biggest challenge if he does indeed win a second term? ""The same thing as the first four years, and that's getting jobs for people, and getting our economy back in order, and building a sense of confidence in the American people so that they know that their futures can be sustainable.""

"(CNN) -- A last-gasp goal from Swedish international midfielder Pontus Wernbloom saw CSKA Moscow earn a 1-1 Champions League last 16 home draw with Real Madrid on a freezing cold night in the Russian capital. Wernbloom, making his debut for the club following his recent transfer from Dutch club AZ Alkmaar, was on hand to fire home from close range in the third minute of injury time, after Alexei Berezutsky's cross from the left had caused uncertainty in the Real Madrid defense. The goal came somewhat against the run of play, with Jose Mourinho's side appearing to comfortably deal with both the extreme weather and the artificial pitch in the Luzhniki Stadium. Real came into the match in sparkling domestic form, holding a 10-point lead over rivals Barcelona in the Spanish La Liga title race. And they began well in front of a partisan 63,000 crowd, with home keeper Sergei Chepchugov pulling off a great double save from Gonzalo Higuain and Sami Khedira. However, Chepchugov could do nothing to prevent the visitors taking a 28th-minute lead, as Ronaldo found the net with a powerful drive after Zoran Tosic failed to clear Fabio Coentrao's cross from the left. The second half proved a cagey affair, although CSKA's Japanese midfielder Keisuke Honda tested goalkeeper Iker Casillas with a fierce free-kick. And, with time nearly up, Wernbloom pounced to deny Madrid victory -- although the nine-times champions are still the heavy favorites to progress to the quarterfinals following the second leg in two weeks' time. Mourinho told reporters: ""CSKA are difficult opponents and this was a difficult match. In Madrid, the weather conditions and the pitch will be completely different but I expect a tough battle there also.""","Real Madrid are held to a 1-1 Champions League draw at CSKA Moscow .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- An honest taxi driver and forgetful passenger have left Hong Kong police trying to sort out who has a rightful claim on more than $250,000 in cash left in the back of a cab. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, police are seeking legal advice over the case which began in the middle of last year. A gambler returning from Macau reportedly left two million Hong Kong dollars, roughly U.S. $256,000, in the back of the taxi. The driver turned it into the police, who then tried to track down the rightful owner. Hong Kong law dictates that after three months, the police may return Hong Kong property to the finder. The taxi driver came forward at this point but the authorities declined to give him the prize, saying they were still investigating and would continue to hold the cash. But the forgetful gambler eventually spotted the story in a newspaper and came forward to collect the money after proving he was the rightful owner, the report said. He claimed he didn't report the loss because he didn't think anyone would hand the money in. ""He was able to say the money was from Macau, the type of bag it was left in, and the material used to bind the wads of banknotes. He could also say exactly where and when he boarded and left the cab and other details,"" a police officer told the SCMP. Now the police have to decide whether the bemused cabbie has a case, or if the hapless gambler can finally take all. Huen Wong of the Law Society in Hong Kong believes in the end the owner will have a better claim to the money than taxi driver. Giving the goods to the finder after three months ""is at the discretion of the police"" and not legally required, he said.","Gambler returning from Macau reportedly left around U.S. $256,000 in the back of a cab in Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- One woman died and at least eight other people were hospitalized after being exposed to an odor at a McDonald's restaurant in eastern Georgia, a police chief said Thursday. Police and fire personnel were called to one of the chain's restaurants in Pooler, just west of Savannah, about 11:50 a.m. Wednesday, Pooler Police Chief Mark Revenew said. Upon arrival, first responders found two people unconscious in the women's restroom and also ""became stricken (by) an odor,"" according to Revenew. Pooler Fire Chief Wade Simmons said crews ""immediately backed out and put on their breathing apparatus,"" at which point they re-entered the bathroom. The stench notwithstanding, Revenew said, authorities were able to bring the women outside and begin providing medical attention, including CPR. Nine people, including three firefighters, were transported to a local hospital. The nine included Anne Felton, 80, of Ponte Vedra, Florida, who died. The police chief said that although an investigation is under way, authorities do not anticipate filing criminal charges. ""It appears to be an accident,"" Revenew said. The chief did not offer any other details, including the cause or nature of the toxic fumes. And in a statement released through McDonald's corporate offices, franchise owners John and Monique Palmaccio said ""authorities have been unable to determine the cause of the incident.""

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Look out for cancellation penalties. Beware of energy surcharges. And watch for facilities fees. Car rental firms are hemorrhaging money faster than oil leaking from a cracked gasket. No, not on your airline ticket. Not on your hotel folio. You may find these new extras on your next car rental bill. Beleaguered auto rental firms are quietly adding new surcharges designed to lift revenues in a recessionary economy. To get an idea of how absurd it's becoming meet Jim Swofford. He found a mysterious $5 fee on his Hertz bill recently, which a representative described as a cancellation fee. Car rental companies typically don't charge their customers for cancellations, so Swofford, who frequently rents from Hertz, said he didn't want another car he'd reserved for later. ""That'll be $25,"" the agent told him. ""So I jokingly said I would not cancel but just be a no-show,"" he remembers. ""She said that would result in a $50 fee."" Or talk to Eric Hegwer, a photographer from Austin, Texas, who spotted a $1 ""energy surcharge"" on his Hertz car rental bill recently. ""My previous rentals didn't have one,"" he says. I asked Hertz about the two new surcharges. Company spokeswoman Paula Rivera told me the cancellation fee, which was added in December, applied only to prepaid reservations and is meant to ""reimburse Hertz for the paperwork and billing involved with a prepaid reservation."" The fee also covers part of the company's cost of holding vehicles for prepaid reservations. The energy surcharge, which was added in October, bills all rentals in most states an additional $1 a day ""to offset the increasing costs of utilities, bus fuel, oil and grease,"" she said. It's easy to see why car rental companies are taking these steps. The industry is hemorrhaging money faster than oil leaking from a cracked gasket. Hertz lost $73 million in the fourth quarter, and competitor Avis lost $121 million in the same period. They fared much better than Advantage Rent A Car, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December and whose assets were sold to Hertz for a reported $33 million. Every penny counts for the car rental companies. Then again, in this dreadful economy, who isn't counting every cent? Shocking anecdotes aside, there's a pattern here, and you don't have to be an investigative reporter or a conspiracy theory-obsessed columnist to see it. Just read the annual reports issued by one of the publicly traded car rental companies. (Look for the form 10-K and then scroll down to ""Legal Proceedings"" for an enlightening read.) They're littered with lawsuits over fees, surcharges and add-ons that motorists say broadsided them when they rented a car. A representative of the American Car Rental Association, a trade group for the car rental business, says these fees are essential to the industry's survival. But that doesn't give companies a license to surprise their customers. ""The car rental company has an obligation to clearly and concisely explain all fees and charges at the time of rental, "" says Robert Barton, the association's president and chief operating officer for U-Save Car & Truck Rental. How to stay ahead of these extras? Knowing is half the battle. Here are five of the newer charges that could sideswipe you on your next trip. A fee for something you've already paid for . This is one of the more creative new ways of separating you from your money: charging you twice for the same thing. ""Three times now, with three different companies, they have tried to charge me for gas when I've returned the car with a full tank and claimed it was an honest mistake,"" says Sid Savara, a software engineer in Oahu, Hawaii. ""It leads me to suspect they are just tacking the fee on and most people aren't noticing or complaining about it."" Boston-based author John DiPietro brought his own E-ZPass toll transponder when he rented a car in Massachusetts recently, but Budget billed him for the toll roads anyway. ""We're still trying to resolve it,"" he told me. Now more than ever, it's important to be on the lookout for duplicate charges on your rental bill. A fee for something that should come with the car . Such as tires. Enterprise recently charged one of Edgar Dworsky's readers a $2 ""tire fee."" He edits a Web site called Consumer World, and like me, he hears a lot of horror stories from travelers. What's a tire fee? Enterprise told Dworsky it was required by the state of Florida. ""I guess the consumer advice is to order a car without tires next time,"" he joked. But other fees can't be blamed on the state, including surcharges that cover the cost of oil and grease. It might be interesting to show up at a car rental counter with four tires and a can of Pennzoil, and ask to have those fees waived. You think they would do it? Yeah, neither do I. Surcharge on surcharges . Scott Lerman found a ""privilege fee"" on his last car rental in Florida, which applied to rentals picked up within 48 hours of flight arrival. ""Never seen anything like it,"" says the Livingston, New Jersey-based freelance publicist. (The fee covers the costs of operating an off-airport location.) Other renters have reported seeing a similar surcharge combined with what's often called a concession recovery fee, which amounts to a surcharge on top of a surcharge. At best, car rental companies are coming up with new and confusing names for their fees. At worst, they're charging us a fee on top of another fee. Next thing you know, there'll be a surcharge on a surcharge on top of a surcharge. Don't laugh -- I'm sure they've already thought of it. The stadium tax . Fees for new stadiums and concert halls are technically not new, and technically they're not even controlled by car rental companies. Except that municipalities keep coming up with new ones and car rental companies don't lobby hard enough to have the fees removed. So rental firms are not completely blameless. Seth Mendelsohn, the president of a food store in Boulder, Colorado, found a $4 ""downtown arena"" fee on his bill when he visited Kansas City recently. ""Apparently the city is trying to pay for part of the Sprint Center through car rental fees,"" he told me. There are dozens -- perhaps hundreds -- of these so-called stadium taxes across the country. And new ones keep popping up. One of the latest is a car rental tax in Gwinnett County, Georgia, to build a stadium for the Atlanta Braves. And just last week, legislators proposed a $2 tax to fund commuter rail service in South Florida. Extra driver fees . These aren't brand new, but the way in which they're being enforced has changed recently. When Carol Stevenson and her sister rented a car from Payless in Phoenix, they were asked to pay $9 a day more if Stevenson's sister wanted to drive. ""And that didn't include their insurance waiver,"" she remembers. Why charge for an extra driver? The simple answer: because they can. In the past, car rental agents looked the other way when two drivers showed up to rent the same car. But now, with money tight, they're applying more pressure to authorize a second driver. If you don't fork over the money and happen to get into an accident, they warn, you won't be covered by their insurance. Of course, that assumes you buy their overpriced collision-damage waiver in the first place. Odds are, your credit card or car insurance offers comparable coverage. Most of these fees can be avoided by pre-paying for your car through one of the ""opaque"" travel sites such as Hotwire.com or Priceline.com, or by buying through an online travel agency that guarantees its rates. But car rental companies are trying to find a way to stick it to customers with prepaid vouchers, too. I'll have more on that in a future column. Where will it end? Something tells me we're not there yet. Not even close. (Christopher Elliott is the ombudsman for National Geographic Traveler magazine. This column originally appeared on MSNBC.com.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Open any fashion magazine and you're instantly bombarded with a collection of blindingly beautiful celebrities, bedazzled with shimmering jewels and perfectly coiffed ""messy hair."" Anna Boccia Lewis has been a DVF fan since the 1970s. Do you own a wrap dress? Tell us why. They teeter on gorgeous stilettos strutting their perfectly toned figures in clothing that could cost as much as a typical mortgage. Close that same fashion magazine -- or maybe ever-so-gently hurl it at the wall -- and perhaps you're left feeling slightly inadequate and envious. After all, why should we be left out of all the fun just because we can't afford the clothing in the magazine? But there is one fashion item that has arguably been bridging the gap for more than three decades between the wealthy elite and the average woman. This item is Diane Von Furstenberg's wrap dress. Just like the ""Little Black Dress,""  Furstenberg's wrap dress is considered an essential in many womens' wardrobes. Diane Von Furstenberg, or DVF as she's known, sold her first wrap dress in the 1970s. ""It has been a unique phenomenon, "" the Belgian designer told CNN. ""What was new about my wrap dress was that I did it in jersey and therefore it molded the body and it was very flattering to the body."" Technically speaking, a wrap dress is like a kimono. ""It's a very traditional form of clothing, it's a dress that has no buttons and no zipper,"" said Von Furstenberg. Since its inception, millions have flown off the racks. But that isn't to say the dress didn't see its dark periods as well. There was a time when the trend for wrap dresses was declared over, but like any good (or bad) fashion, it experienced a revival. ""Fashion changed completely and things went away,"" said Von Furstenberg. ""Ten years ago I started again because I saw that very hip young girls were buying them in thrift shops."" That trend continues today. While the dresses are stocked in DVF stores, they are regularly bought and sold in vintage stores and through online auction sites, such as eBay. ""My love affair with the DVF wrap dress began in the 1970s,"" says Anna Boccia Lewis, a self-confessed ""DVF addict"" from California. ""One of my first purchases was a yellow floral vintage DVF shirtdress that I found at Goodwill in South San Francisco for $4.75. ""I think what I love the most about Diane's designs is that each one has its own special personality -- just like the woman who is wearing it,"" Anna said. CNN asked other women to tell us what it is about DVF dresses that make them so special. Tell us your story -- ""Sound Off"" below. ""They make me feel not only sexy, but successful, sophisticated and timeless,"" said Carolyn Yapp, a 24-year-old DVF devotee from Jamaica.

Tracey Jennings of the United Kingdom has been wearing DVF dresses for the last ten years. She said: ""Like a lot of women, I have varied in size from year to year. As a result, my wrap dresses range from size four to size 10."" Kirsty Palmer, also from the United Kingdom, recently sold one of her DVF dresses on eBay. ""I like to change my selection,"" she said. ""Buying vintage wrap dresses makes them more affordable for me, yet I still get the benefit as if I were buying new due to their classic cuts and their durability."" Do you own a wrap dress?

"London (CNN) -- The first night-flowering orchid known to science has been discovered by botanists on an island in Southeast Asia. The new species, called Bulbophyllum nocturnum, is the first which has flowers which consistently open up at night and close in the morning, say botanists. It was found by Dutch orchid specialist Ed de Vogel during a field trip to the island of New Britain, near Papua New Guinea. After gaining permission to collect orchids from a logging area on the island de Vogel took them back to the Netherlands for cultivation at the Hortus Botanicus in Leiden. The orchid starting producing buds but would wilt once they reached the size at which they would usually open. Or so de Vogel thought. It was only when he took the plant home that he was able to observe the buds opening at night. According to de Vogel, the buds would flower at 10pm before closing again around twelve hours later. The flowers only last one night. Botanists aren't sure why this species flowers after dark but suggest it might be because its pollinators are midges which forage at night. The newly-described orchid belongs to a group of species called Epicrianthes which are noteworthy for their bizarre flowers and strange appendages, according to botanists. Only a small amount of all known plant species flower at night, says Andre Schuiteman, an orchid specialist from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London. ""There must be hundreds, but only a few are relatively well known because they are cultivated,"" Schuiteman said. These include the queen of the night cactus, the midnight horror tree and the night blooming jasmine, according to Kew. But until now not one of the estimated 25,000 orchid species on Earth was known to do the same. ""This is another reminder that surprising discoveries can still be made. But it's a race against time to find species like this that only occur in primeval forests. As we all know, such forests are disappearing fast,"" Schuiteman said.","Botanists discover first night-flowering orchid on island near Papua New Guinea .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- There was a time when action heroes didn't contemplate. They defeated the bad guy and let their bodies do the talking for them. How times have changed. Blast from the past: Jean-Claude Van Damme plays himself in ""JCVD."" Action movies can still be a big draw at the box office -- ""The Dark Knight"" has grossed nearly $1 billion worldwide, according to BoxOfficeGuru.com -- and action sequences have never been more intricate or thrilling. But audiences these days are demanding more of everything -- more adrenaline, more emotion, more complexity. The action movies today are a far cry from the ones that helped spur the rise of the genre in the 1980s, when hard bodies like Arnold Schwarzenegger merely had to flex their muscles and utter monosyllables to generate a following. Everything was more straightforward for the tough guys of yesteryear. Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis and Arnie tackled problems with big guns, big muscles and big egos. There was a clear division between good and evil, and machismo conquered all. These days, the tough guy persona is giving way to more multifaceted characters. Watching the hero beat up the bad guy is old hat; understanding the source of his rage makes the action far more riveting. What do you want from an action hero? Tell us in the SoundOff below. The most successful action film this year, ""The Dark Knight,"" is filled with dynamic characters (Heath Ledger is hotly tipped to pick up a posthumous Oscar for his portrayal as The Joker) and delves into the intricacies of everything from heroism to anarchy. The violence is rife, but it's not meaningless. In other popular movies like ""Quantum of Solace"" and the Bourne series, high-octane chase scenes are what get your pulse racing. But it is Bond's (Daniel Craig) battered emotional state that anchors ""Quantum's"" story. For Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, the quest to recover his memory and identity is what adds emotional depth -- and advances the story enough to keep it interesting over three films. In contrast, films like ""Transporter 3,"" whose macho hero Frank Martin harks back to the self-reliant tough guys of action flicks past, has been mostly panned for its weak story and mindless action. Even action men of earlier decades are out to prove they aren't just fighting machines. Jean-Claude Van Damme, the so-called ""Muscles from Brussels"" who made a name for himself in the 1980s with his killer martial arts moves, lets his guard down in the parody ""JCVD,"" due out in the UK in February. Van Damme basically plays himself -- a downbeat actor dealing with the collapse of his family life -- and delivers a performance that entertainment trade publication Variety said ""constitutes the headiest stretch of the beefy star's career since, well, ever."" Mickey Rourke, another tough guy, earned a Golden Globe nomination for playing a broken down fighter in ""The Wrestler,"" and could be tipped for an Oscar as the Golden Globes are considered to be a harbinger of the Oscars. In a role that he says struck close to home, he plays a washed-up wrestler whose daughter wants nothing to do with him. Aside from the hard bodies, action stars of today barely resemble their counterparts from decades earlier. Audiences appear to want more than high-octane sequences from their action heroes, and that's not a bad thing.","Action heroes used to punch first and think about the consequences later .
But these days good and evil aren't so clear cut and muscles don't conquer all .
It is the psychology behing a tough guy's rage that keeps audiences engaged now .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored twice as European champions Barcelona secured the Club World Cup with a 4-0 rout of Brazil's Santos in Yokohama Sunday. Messi opened Barcelona's account and added their fourth and final goal in a one-sided match against their South American counterparts. Xavi and Cesc Fabregas scored their other goals in a first-half which saw Pep Guardiola's men 3-0 ahead and in total control. It is their second Club World Cup title after 2009 and the 13th trophy won since Guardiola took charge at the Camp Nou in 2008. ""We've got a core of very talented players and the secret of our success is simple,"" he told the official FIFA website. ""We study our opponents closely, use space well, keep control of the ball and move it around very quickly. My players are real competitors and I'm sure they're going to want to keep on going and win more trophies."" The match was billed as a showdown between Santos' Neymar, who inspired their semifinal win over Kashiwa Reysol, and Argentina's Messi. Villa injury mars Barcelona semifinal win . But the Brazilian teenager was kept quiet and uncharacteristically wasted two second half opportunities. By contrast, Messi was at his irrepressible best, and set up by Xavi on 17 minutes made no mistake with a chipped finish. Xavi then struck after a fine run by Dani Alves and Barcelona were 2-0 up and cruising. Barely half and hour was on the clock when former Arsenal star Fabregas beat Rafael Cabral at the near post, with Xavi again the instigator after an impudent backheel from Messi. Barcelona were able to coast through the second half as Santos enjoyed their best spell, but it was fitting that Messi added his second with eight minutes left.

His prosecution speaks volumes, however, about America's rush to use criminal justice to address problems that are better resolved by other means. Every bad act is not a crime. Every kid who does a stupid thing is not a criminal. As the whole world knows, Ravi secretly videotaped his roommate, Tyler Clementi, having sex with another man. He let some other people watch the video, and he tweeted that Tyler was gay. Clementi then jumped off a bridge to his death. Let's be honest. A lot of people want a pound of flesh from Ravi because they blame him for Clementi's death. Tyler's reaction was tragic, and it was idiosyncratic. It is possible to deeply mourn Clementi's death and also to acknowledge that he probably had issues other than Ravi. No judge in the country would have allowed a homicide prosecution, because, legally speaking, Ravi did not cause the death, nor was it reasonably foreseeable. Of the millions of people who are bullied or who suffer invasions of privacy, few kill themselves. But in the classic fashion of overreaching prosecutors, the New Jersey district attorney found 15 other crimes to charge Ravi with. Legal experts expect that he will get at least a five-year prison sentence and then be deported to India, where he was born but hasn't lived since he was 2. For his stupidity, Ravi should be shamed by his fellow students and kicked out of his dorm, but he should not be sent to prison for years and then banished from the United States. In their hearts the prosecutors must know this, which is why they offered him a plea bargain that included no jail time and a recommendation against deportation. But prosecutors don't like it when a defendant exercises his constitutional right to go to trial, and after winning their case they are likely to ask for big time. The prosecution seemed to play on the emotional circumstances of Clementi's death as much as the actual facts of the case. The most serious charge was that Ravi intended to intimidate Clementi by filming him having sex with another guy. But how can you intend to intimidate someone by filming him when you hide the camera and don't want the person to know he's being filmed? In addition, New Jersey's hate crime law presents troubling First Amendment issues. If Ravi had been convicted of being motivated to act because someone was fat or a nerd, he'd be looking at five years in prison. Because he commented on Clementi's sexual orientation, he gets twice as much time. The problem with broad laws like New Jersey's is that they come too close to punishing people for what they think. Bigotry, including homophobia, is morally condemnable, but in a free country, it should not be a punishable offense. When I was a freshman at Yale, my roommate constantly played a Patti Smith record called ""Rock and Roll Nigger."" I hated the song, but it never occurred to me that I should have called the police on my roommate. Part of the reason Yale paired me, an African-American from Chicago, with my roommate, a Jewish kid from Brooklyn, was for us to learn how to work out our differences. We did, and now, 25 years later, we're still friends. Those kinds of lessons are what college is for, as much as anything you learn in the classroom. Ravi and Clementi never had that moment, but at the trial, evidence was presented that it might have happened. After Ravi had spied on Clementi, he heard that Clementi wanted a new roommate. Ravi texted him and asked him to reconsider. He said, ""I've known you were gay and I have no problem with it."" This does not sound like a homophobe -- it sounds like a freshman who was taking a step to becoming more mature. Ravi did not invent homophobia, but he is being scapegoated for it. Bias against gay people is, sadly, embedded in American culture. Until last year people were being kicked out of the military because they were homosexuals. None of the four leading presidential candidates -- President Obama, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich -- thinks that gay people should be allowed to get married. A better way to honor the life of Clementi would be for everyone to get off their high horse about a 20-year-old kid and instead think about how we can promote civil rights in our own lives. Though a national conversation about civility and respect would have been better, as usual for social problems, we looked to the criminal justice system. The United States incarcerates more of its citizens than any country in the world. We are an extraordinarily punitive people. Clementi died for America's sins. And now, Ravi faces years in prison for the same reason. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Butler.","Dharun Ravi is found guilty of spying on and intimidating his gay roommate Tyler Clementi .

"London (CNN) -- Alessio Rastani went on a UK news channel on Monday to discuss where stock markets were heading. By Tuesday he was an Internet sensation. Was it that he said, as someone who bets against markets rising, that he ""goes to bed every night dreaming of a recession?"" Was it that he said investment bank Goldman Sachs ruled the world and not governments? Or was it that bloggers started to ask if he was just a ""fake trader"" who duped the media? Take your pick. But Rastani caused a stir by saying what many people think those in the markets think anyway -- it's OK to make money out of falling markets and there is no reason not to prepare for that. He certainly thinks the markets will crash again and people should be prepared for that, and that the average person should take steps now to protect their assets, or be prepared to lose their investments. There is nothing wrong with giving that kind of advice, if that is what you think will happen. It's just unlikely you would hear that from an established player from a bank that is looking for clients. Still, it was worth hearing more from Rastani and to find out if he really believes what he said, if he understood the stir around him and whether he is in fact a trader. CNN brought him in, and I asked him all that. Firstly, Rastani is an amateur trader using his own money (as a ""hobby"", he has told other media) and he's not registered with the Financial Services Authority to trade other people's money. He doesn't claim otherwise, but there was a feeling after his first interview that he was some sort of suit from the City or Wall Street giving sage advice to his clients. He does or can have other clients though. His website calls him a speaker and trainer of others who want to trade. In my interview, Rastani said he does trade being prepared for a recession, but that as a ""human being you don't want it. As a trader you think differently. You're going to have volatile... conditions to make money in that market."" He also said he was a religious man. He was also clearly nervous about the whole affair and was undecided for an hour to whether he should actually sit on our set for the interview. He said no a few times, before we sat down. ""The question is, why are they paying attention to this?"" he asked. ""In my opinion somebody out there doesn't want my voice to be heard and they want to attack me and damage me."" He talked of the 'Big Boys' being desperate to keep people like him from talking about the coming economic storm. He admits there may be a book in the works, but one that focuses on traders whom he admires. When I asked him if he was for real, he said he would not say things about the markets he did not truly believe. When I asked him if he is a member of the so-called ""Yes-Men"" who have faked TV interviews in the past, he would not say yes or no. ""Let people believe what they want to,"" he said. To my mind, he should have been touted up front as a guy who has strong opinions on the markets, but certainly not as a 'trader' or ""investment adviser"" in the classic sense. That does not make his view any more or less valid but, with that preamble, I don't think it would have gone viral.","Alessio Rastani said he went to ""bed every night dreaming of a recession""

"(Mashable) -- Apple developers, start your engines. Mac users, start dreaming of how much cooler your desktop or laptop experience could be this summer. That's when Apple will launch the latest big cat-themed Mac OS X, version 10.8: Mountain Lion. At 8:30 a.m. EST Thursday, the developer preview version of Mountain Lion became available to Apple's legions of app makers. Mashable was briefed on the new Mac OS prior to the announcement. Bottom line? It's a few more vital steps closer to fully connecting the experience you have on the Mac with the world of the iPad and the iPhone -- dumping iChat in favor of iMessage and Twitter, to take the most radical example. It's almost as if it makes your Mac moonlight as an iPad. But it is categorically not the one OS to rule them all, if such a thing is even on Apple's radar. OS 10.7, or Lion, launched in July 2011; 30 percent of Mac users now have it installed. (Another 50 percent of us still favor Snow Leopard). Coming in the wake of the iPad, it was clearly influenced by the success of the device. It introduced such iOS-like features as multitouch gestures on the trackpad and a ""launchpad"" of apps that looked just like the iPad's home screen. Some of us began to wonder, with some cause, whether Mac OS X and the iOS were heading for a marriage down the road. The iOS Moves In . Well, here's the next phase in the relationship, and iOS has practically moved in to Mac's house. If Lion was a toothbrush in the bathroom, Mountain Lion is a chest of drawers in the bedroom. Reminders, iMessage, Game Center, Notifications, iCloud and Twitter integration â€” all iOS's most intimate stuff is here, and it all pretty much looks the same as it does on the iPad. Most of it is designed to sync up so it is exactly the same. SEE ALSO: Apple Mountain Lion Embraces Flickr and Vimeo Sharing . And Mac OS X has had to throw out some of its stuff. Bouncing icons in the dock? Who needs them when you've got Notifications, which appear in classy banners down the side of the screen? The venerable antique Instant Message software, iChat, a 2002 vintage? A stupid wagon-wheel coffee table, says iOS. Throw it out. Instead, here's iMessage, which will still let you IM your contacts (if you must). But what it really wants you to do is use Apple's seamless texting replacement of the same name. Admittedly, the thought of being able to immediately text anyone with an iPhone for free from your desktop is so unbelievably cool, it can bring on an attack of the vapors. You get the sense the Mac is going to be happy with its new roommate. What's not to like about Airplay, which can seamlessly mirror your desktop on an HDTV? Or a separate Notes app, where you can attach notes to the desktop like stickies? Or Game Center, which will mean a lot more cross-device play? Or a ""share sheet,"" which effectively means developers are going to be able to put Twitter buttons everywhere? Mountain Lion will already let you tweet from all standard OS X apps such as Safari and Photo Booth. That means you can sit and take photos of yourself and instantly tweet them, to your heart's content. It's a boon for Twitter users (Twitter readers, not so much). So things are going to be a lot more fun around the edges of the Mac OS -- which is no bad thing. At the grand old age of 12, OS X was starting to seem a little too same-y with each iteration. This new younger partner is about to give the Mac a new lease on life. (How much that will cost, we don't know; Apple isn't announcing a price yet, or a launch date more precise than ""late summer."") But don't expect iOS to go hog-wild and bring its apps on board in future versions. Apple is giving a hefty push to the Mac app store, which benefits from a security feature called Gatekeeper where you can limit installations to just Mac store apps. (You might want to do this for your malware prone-parents, say.) Developers are going to have to make two separate versions of apps they want on Mac and iOS for some time to come, and that's just fine with Apple. When it comes to its two operating systems, the company seems to believe living together is good enough. So what do you think? Will you buy it? Take a quick gander at a video we put together with material from Apple, then a gallery of screenshots -- and last but not least, your chance to chat up a storm about this major Mac development in the comments. © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- In most of the country, employers can force pregnant workers out of the workplace when their pregnancy interferes with their normal job duties. Heather Wiseman, a retail sales associate, lost her job because consuming water while working, an activity necessary to maintain a healthy pregnancy, violated store policy. Victoria Serednyj, a nursing home activity director, lost her job because her pregnancy interfered with her ability to lift heavy tables. Her employer terminated her employment even though lifting tables ""took up a small part, roughly five to 10 minutes"" of her day and her co-workers volunteered to perform this task. Workers covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, by contrast, can continue working despite their physical limitations. The Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008 broadened the ADA to include many short-term and relatively minor physical conditions. Pregnant women who experience comparable physical limitations should also have the opportunity to receive accommodations that will enable them to continue working. According to EEOC regulations issued in 2011, the amended ADA requires employers to accommodate persons who experience ""shortness of breath and fatigue when walking distances that most people could walk without experiencing such effects."" It also requires employers to accommodate persons with back injuries resulting in a ""20-pound lifting restriction that lasts or is expected to last for several months."" In some circumstances, even a far more common 50-pound lifting restriction may qualify an individual for ADA coverage. To date, courts have balked at including pregnancy within the Americans with Disabilities Act. They've reasoned the physical limitations accompanying pregnancy are too short-term and minor to qualify as disabilities. The courts' remaining objection to providing ADA accommodations to pregnant workers is pregnancy is ""the natural consequence of a properly functioning reproductive system"" and therefore cannot be a disability. The Family and Medical Leave Act provides no protection to the approximately 40% of American workers who fall outside its scope. Even for workers covered by the act, it does little to enable women to continue working during their pregnancies. When a pregnant worker is unable to perform her usual job duties, her employer may force her to take unpaid leave under the act even when temporary job modifications would enable her to continue working. If the employer requires her to take leave before the 28th week of pregnancy, the worker will lose her FMLA-guaranteed right to reinstatement because she will exhaust her 12 weeks of FMLA leave before the baby arrives. Unlike pregnant workers, ADA-eligible employees can continue earning a paycheck whenever they are able to do their job with reasonable accommodations. And if ADA-eligible workers also enjoy FMLA coverage, they can save their FMLA leave for situations when their medical condition truly necessitates time off. The courts' objections misunderstand the Americans with Disabilities Act. The ADA significantly differs from earlier disability laws that viewed persons with disabilities as defective. The ADA recognizes much of the disadvantage associated with disability is more environmental than biological. For example, historical decisions to solely provide building access by stairs reflect the historical assumption wheelchair users would not, and should not, participate in public life. Had wheelchair users historically been considered full citizens, employers and architects would not have so frequently designed buildings that exclude them. Properly understood, the ADA's mandate to reimagine our social environment to accommodate historically excluded persons should encompass pregnancy. Like more traditional ""disabilities,"" the interaction between pregnancy and many work environments constricts women's employment opportunities. It also reflects the historical workforce marginalization of childbearing women. If American culture is to value pregnant women as legitimate wage earners, work polices should accommodate pregnancy's physical effects. Accommodation rights for pregnant workers need to catch up to accommodation rights for persons with disabilities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeannette Cox.","Law professor: Americans with Disabilities Act should include pregnancy .

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. envoy will meet with North Korean officials next week to test that nation's willingness to abandon its nuclear program, the State Department said Monday. Special Representative for North Korea Policy Glyn Davies will meet with his counterpart, North Korean First Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, in Beijing on February 23, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters. Davies just returned from Russia, where he discussed continuing efforts to get North Korea to disarm. The talks will mark the first high-level contact since the death of North Korea's longtime leader, Kim Jong Il, in December and the subsequent transition of power to his youngest son, Kim Jong Un. Washington hopes the talks signal the new regime's desire to negotiate with the United States and address international concerns over its nuclear program. Kim's death last month threw into flux U.S. plans for renewed diplomacy with North Korea, including formal talks on ending Pyongyang's nuclear program and possible resumption of U.S. food assistance. The North Korea government was expected to suspend its uranium enrichment in exchange for food assistance as part of a deal that was to be announced around the time of Kim's death.","U.S. envoy Glyn Davies is scheduled to meet with a North Korean official in Beijing .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Los Angeles elementary school teacher allegedly took bondage photos of more than two dozen students in his classroom, including some with suspected semen-filled spoons at their mouths, investigators said Tuesday. The young students ""didn't realize they were victimized,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Dan Scott told CNN Tuesday. ""They thought they were being blindfolded and gagged as a game,"" he said. ""And they were rewarded with cookies or spoons full of sugar (but) they did not realize the spoon contained semen."" The photographs also showed ""a large 3-inch cockroach that would crawl on their face,"" Scott said. Mark Berndt, 61, was arrested on child molestation charges at his Torrance, California, home Monday and is being held pending $2.3 million bond in a Los Angeles County jail, according to Sheriff's Lt. Carlos Marquez. He is scheduled to make a first appearance before a judge Wednesday morning on 23 counts of lewd acts on a child, according to the county's district attorney. CNN was not able to immediately identify or reach Berndt's lawyer. While the investigation began more than a year ago, the arrest came soon after lab testing matched Berndt's DNA with semen found on a spoon recovered from his classroom, Scott said. Investigators persuaded the suspect to voluntarily give them a DNA sample just two months ago, he said. The 30-year teaching veteran was removed from his job at Miramonte Elementary School in south Los Angeles on January 7, 2011, the day the sheriff's department told the school district about the investigation, Los Angeles School Superintendent John Deasy said. ""I am sickened and horrified by the behavior of Mark Berndt. This individual and his conduct do not reflect on the quality of the teachers who work so hard on behalf of the students in the Los Angeles Unified School District,"" Deasy said in a written statement. The probe started when a film processor gave investigators ""over 40 photographs depicting children in a school classroom, with their eyes blindfolded and mouths covered with tape,"" the sheriff's statement said. ""Investigators learned that some of the photos depicted suspect Mark Berndt with his arm around the children, or with his hand over their mouths,"" it said. Some photos show female students with ""what appeared to be a blue plastic spoon, filled with an unknown clear/white liquid substance, up to their mouths as if they were going to ingest the substance,"" the statement said. Other photos showed ""children with large live Madagascar-type cockroaches on their faces and mouths,"" it said. Investigators, who interviewed more than 80 current and former students and school employees, identified 23 boys and girls then between the ages of 7 and 10 years old as victims in crimes that are believed to have been committed between 2005 and 2010, it said. A search of Berndt's home found more than 100 more similar photographs depicting children and a video depicting adult sexual ""bondage"" activity ""which mirrored the bondage-type photos of the children,"" investigators said. The film processor later gave investigators an additional 250 photographs, it said. About 10 children seen in the more than 400 images have not yet been identified, it said. ""Early in the investigation, Special Victims Bureau detectives recovered a blue plastic spoon and an empty container from the trash within the suspect's classroom,"" the sheriff's statement said. ""The recovered items tested positive for semen. Through further investigation, the suspect's DNA was obtained and tested, and (investigators) determined that it matched that of the DNA profile found on the spoon and container."" Investigators did not reveal the contents of the fluid to the children or tell them that the case involved child molestation allegations, Scott said. CNN's Stan Wilson contributed to this report.","The young students ""didn't realize they were victimized,"" an investigator says .

"(CNN) -- A grassroots group is pushing to have the sites of two levee breaches during Hurricane Katrina placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The group's founder said Thursday that the mission is to change the belief that the storm caused the flooding in New Orleans after Katrina struck in 2005, killing hundreds across six states, with a majority of fatalities in Louisiana. ""It was engineering failure,"" said Sandy Rosenthal, who also serves as the director of the group, Levees.org. The two nominated sites, which caused most of the flooding in New Orleans, are the 17th Street Canal and the Industrial Canal near the Lower 9th Ward, which is owned by the corps. Levees.org filed a nomination in August requesting the two sites be designated as national historic sites. The New Orleans Army Corps of Engineers said it's following the nomination process, but is concerned about the impact it will have on future levee lifts. ""There is no need to worry ... we are not nominating the levees and floodwalls, we are nominating the site,"" Rosenthal said. Many state and local officials support the initiative to have the sites recognized, including Mayor Mitch Landrieu's office and the city of New Orleans. The 39-page application was reviewed by a state preservation panel on November 17, where it was struck down 6-3. The Corps' federal preservation officer has 60 days from the date the office receives the nomination for review. According to the corps, they have the ability to approve, request additional information or make changes. The state office of historic preservation, which is under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant governor's office, will work with Levees.org to address concerns by the corps preservation officer and rework the application if necessary. It is unknown whether the corps federal reservation officer has received the application, according to Jacques Berry, spokesman for the lieutenant governor's office. Once the corps preservation officer gets the application, a response is due in 60 days. The National Park Service will make the final decision if the corps and Levees.org agree on the eligibility and the supporting documents for the nomination. The National Register of Historic Places was established in 1966 to recognize places worthy of preservation nationwide.","The two nominated sites caused most of the flooding in New Orleans .

"(CNN) -- Carlo Ancelotti paid the ultimate price for failing to deliver trophies at Chelsea last season, being sacked by the English club's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich just hours after a defeat on the final day. The Italian is determined to avoid a similar fate at Paris Saint-Germain by guiding the big-spending French club back into the European Champions League -- a competition where success proves ever elusive for Abramovich -- for the first time since 2004. Ancelotti replaced the sacked Antoine Kombouare at the Parc des Princes in December, with PSG sitting top of France's Ligue 1. His appointment has been just one of many changes aimed at boosting the club's profile since the Qatar Investment Authority became PSG's majority shareholder in May 2011. The 52-year-old inherited an expensively-assembled squad including Argentina playmaker Javier Pastore, who signed from Italy's Palermo for a French record transfer fee. ""The aim is to play the Champions League next year,"" Ancelotti, who won European club football's biggest prize as a player and coach with AC Milan, told CNN. ""I found the club at the top of the league and so I have to try to do the best to keep the club at the top of the league until the end of the season. But the aim is to play in the Champions League."" Ancelotti fell out of favor at Stamford Bridge after failing to follow up the glory of his first season in charge, when he oversaw Chelsea's first Premier League and FA Cup double. After leading the Blues to second place in the league, he was axed in favor of one of football's rising stars -- former Porto coach Andre Villas-Boas. The 34-year-old is now himself in danger of losing his job, having overseen Chelsea's worst run of results since Abramovich took charge in 2004, and is reportedly facing a player revolt over his team selections. The Blues are outside the qualification spots for next year's Champions League, and their hopes in this season's competition hang by a thread after losing 3-1 in the first leg of the last-16 tie away to Napoli on Tuesday. Villas-Boas was heavily criticized for starting with experienced England duo of Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole and Ghana's Michael Essien on the subs' bench in Naples -- players who were key figures during Ancelotti's time at Chelsea. ""I think the problem at Chelsea was that they tried to change something, to have a team younger, to give less matches to the most important players Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole, John Terry,"" Ancelotti said. ""But I think that this change needed time because it is very difficult to substitute players like Lampard, Cole and Terry because they are the players in Chelsea."" Ancelotti's coaching staff at PSG includes former Chelsea midfielder Claude Makele, who won two Premier League titles in London under coach Jose Mourinho before moving to the French capital in 2008. ""It makes me sad when I see Chelsea like this,"" the 39-year-old said. ""In a team, you can't change five or six players. It's too much. ""Now Chelsea lose a lot with a lot of experienced players on the bench. This is not fair."" Fifth-placed Chelsea will seek to end a run of five games without a win in all competitions in the league match against Wigan on Saturday, while Ligue 1 leaders PSG travel to sixth-placed Lyon with a one-point advantage over Montpellier.","Carlo Ancelotti says he has to deliver Champions League football at PSG .

"Panacea, Florida (CNN) -- While media outlets and Beltway pundits might use state polls to gauge the race in Florida between GOP presidential hopefuls Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, Ron Crum uses poles. Fishing poles. Crum, a Republican small business owner in this sleepy seaside town south of Tallahassee, calls Romney a multi-millionaire who expects to get breaks because he's rich -- be it a low tax rate or the GOP nomination. But former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Crum says, is a man who understands the plight of the working class and can articulate conservative principles effectively. Picking up two fishing rods, Crum says the expensive Penn International, priced at almost $400, is like Romney. Meanwhile, the Jarvis-Walker, which he says does everything the other rod does but sells for about $50, is like Gingrich. ""I got a customer,"" Crum continues. ""He has about six rod holders on the side of the boat. He's got six Penn Internationals, and when he leaves port he has them on this side of the boat towards the docks, and when he comes in he puts them on the other side of the boat. We go out there because it's a good day to be alive, God built a world let's go enjoy it, but the elitist wants to impress their friends."" Putting the poles back in the rack, Crum says, ""Gingrich, as a capitalist wants to come out here with the working people and the people earn money from the industry of this country. Romney is basically an elitist."" And for conservative North Florida voters, the term elitist is almost as bad as calling someone a liberal. That label is sticking with Romney, even though both candidates are worth more than many North Floridians earn in a lifetime. Empty dock towns . North Florida locals like Rodger Noe say they can remember when industrial fishing and crabbing operations provided jobs for North Florida, back before environmental regulations strangled the local economy. The median income in this conservative area is between $24,000 and $29,000. The sluggish economy is evident on boat docks, with its empty slips. Soundoff: What issues matter to you this election? Most of the boats left belong to people ""with their noses in the air,"" Noe says. ""I got a boat recently,"" Noe says. ""I took it to the dock I used to 10 years ago and the manager was happy to see me. But the owner"" -- Davis sticks his nose up in the air -- ""he didn't want me there, so I was told to go."" Davis says the wealthy dock owner didn't want his workboat ""muddying up"" the view. ""Romney's one of them,"" Noe says. ""I liked Herman Cain, but now I like Newt."" State polls in Florida haven't given much hard data about North Florida's rural areas, but a CNN/Time/ORC poll released Wednesday gave Gingrich a slight edge in north and central Florida while Romney was the favorite from Tampa Bay and south. Romney recently attacked Gingrich as a career politician who hasn't lived in the ""real streets"" of America. ""Well, that's another thing,"" Noe says laughing. ""We got highways and roads here. Cities have streets."" Gingrich motivates gun-owning liberals . The prospect of a Gingrich candidacy is also exciting some of the liberals in the area. In Baum Community, a forested little town north of Tallahassee, former teacher and ""gun-owning liberal"" Paige Forshay says she's been talking about Gingrich a lot with her conservative father. One of the topics was an ex-wife's interviews in which she says he wanted to have an open marriage. ""Newt Gingrich, he's laughable,"" Forshay says. ""It's so interesting his ex-wife came out and says he wanted to have this polyamorous relationship. It's just absolutely hilarious. Who would want to have a polyamorous relationship with that man? How can you run knowing that's out there? You should be embarrassed, you should be ashamed of yourself."" Forshay says if Romney's nominated, she'll vote for the Democrat, but she won't engage in the election. ""Mitt isn't scary,"" Forshay says. But if Gingrich represents the GOP, she'll stuff envelopes, knock on doors... whatever she can do to help Gingrich lose.","North Florida businessman sees Romney as privileged, not having earned his riches .

"Madrid (CNN) -- A treasure worth an estimated half billion dollars in gold and silver coins, recovered from a Spanish warship that sunk two centuries ago, arrived in Madrid Saturday, just weeks after U.S. courts ruled that Spain had rights to the loot, not the Florida deep-sea salvage company which found it on the ocean floor. Two Spanish military cargo planes, which retrieved the nearly 594,000 coins in crates from a secretive warehouse in Florida, landed at the Torrejon military air base in Madrid just before 2 p.m. (8 a.m. ET). The two planes arrived at a U.S. military base in Florida earlier this week -- on the heels of a team of Spanish government experts who did an inventory of the treasure -- and departed on Friday for the overnight flight to Madrid. That was after the Florida company, Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. had exhausted its legal appeals all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined without comment Odyssey's motion for a hearing earlier this month. ""Spain has now been victorious at every level in the United States courts, from Tampa to Atlanta to Washington,"" said Jim Goold, who defended Spain's claim to the treasure. ""I am pleased and proud for all of us."" Odyssey Marine Exploration made an emergency appeal to the high court in an attempt to block a lower court's order that it turn over the treasure to Spain. The dispute goes back to 2007, when Odyssey announced it had found a 19th-century sunken ship off of Spain. The company claimed ownership of the coins and said it had flown them to a guarded location in the United States. Spain filed suit in a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure. Spain says its navy warship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was carrying the coins. The 34-gun frigate left Peru in 1804 and crossed the Atlantic to within a day's sail from Spain when British ships attacked the Spanish fleet. In the ensuing Battle of Cape St. Mary, south of Portugal, the Mercedes was hit in its powder magazine and exploded, according to the Spanish government's filing to the Florida court. In 2009, the federal court in Tampa ruled in favor of Spain and the federal appeals court in Atlanta upheld the ruling last September. Last January 31, the appeals court denied an Odyssey motion, which Odyssey appealed to the Supreme Court. Spain's Culture Minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, told CNN in Madrid earlier this month that the case was never really about the money. ""We're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition, but this is something that enriches our material, artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such,"" Wert said in an interview. He said the coins would be exhibited at Spanish museums, and perhaps elsewhere. Peru, too, has followed the fate of the coins, which came from Latin America when Peru was a Spanish colony. ""Formally, they haven't claimed anything, but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the Latin American museums,"" Wert said. The treasure includes fabled ""pieces of eight,"" some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials have said. The treasure, which already has crossed the Atlantic Ocean twice, by ship in 1804 and then by plane in 2007, has now arrived on the Spanish mainland for the first time. A Spanish Defense Ministry official at the Torrejon base said the treasure will be turned over to Spain's paramilitary Civil Guard for safekeeping. The Culture Ministry is expected to hold a news conference and possibly show off a portion of the coins in the coming days.","A treasure estimated worth half a billion dollars arrived in Spain .

"(CNN) -- A NASA orbiter has beamed back its first images of the far side of the moon, including scenes of a massive crater caused by an ancient cosmic impact, the space agency announced Wednesday. NASA released 30 seconds of video from one of the twin probes that arrived in lunar orbit on December 31 and January 1. The Ebb orbiter passed over the moon from its north to south poles, revealing a new view of the Mare Orientale, a 560-mile basin along the border between the near and far sides of the satellite. Also visible was the smaller Drygalski crater near the lunar south pole, which has a star-shaped peak at its center from what NASA says was a comet or asteroid impact. Ebb and sister ship Flow are part of the space agency's GRAIL program. For 82 days, their instruments will chart the lunar gravitational field, giving scientists a peek into what goes on beneath the surface -- and possibly an insight into how the Earth and its neighbors formed. As for the ""far side of the moon,"" as NASA says on its website, the time it takes the moon to make one rotation on its axis is the same amount of time it takes the moon to orbit around the Earth. ""So,"" NASA explains, ""one 'side' of the moon is always facing the Earth, and the other 'side' is always facing away from the Earth.""","A 30-second NASA video scans the far side of the moon .

"(EW.com) -- When it comes to its creature design, ""The Darkest Hour"" opts for a less-is-more approach. Unfortunately, in this case, less is just less. Rather than any Gigeresque monstrosities or the insectoid extraterrestrials of the J.J. Abrams canon, the space invaders of this surprisingly thrill-less Moscow-set thriller are invisible for much of the film. When you can see them, they resemble nothing more exciting than floating Windows screensavers. By the time these glowing gyros drift down from the night sky like fluff blown off of some cosmic dandelion, we've already been introduced to our gang of would-be survivors and have pretty much figured out in what order they're going to die. Not that we'll be too upset, as it's clear from early on that these characters are as indistinct and lazily rendered as the floating blobs chasing them. The core crew is thus: two American entrepreneurial hopefuls (Emile Hirsch and Max Minghella), a craven and duplicitous Swede (Joel Kinnaman), and two female friends on vacation (Olivia Thirlby and Rachael Taylor), now navigating the Russian capital after much of its population has been reduced to ash. The aliens disintegrate any humans they touch, like the tripods of 2005's ""War of the Worlds."" But where Steven Spielberg evoked muted horror from the victims' cindered remains, you get the feeling that ""The Darkest Hour"" director Chris Gorak and screenwriter Jon Spaihts just do it because it looks cool. They do manage to eke out some fleeting dread when the creatures' electrical fields turn a row of flickering streetlamps into a tense, signaled approach. But when the script switches genres, exchanging survival horror for resistance fighting, it loses whatever momentum it had, and you're left with a battle between two sides, neither of which are particularly interesting. You should be rooting for the humans, but you might as well be rooting for the blobs. Most likely, though, you'll just be rooting for the credits. EW.com rating: D+ . See the full article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- One of the truly remarkable and relatively recent boosts to the health of poor women in this country has been their opportunity to get preventive, reproductive health services at little or no cost in one place. Over the years, one Planned Parenthood clinic after another has been able to offer these women not only affordable contraception, but full exams that include screening for breast cancer, the No. 1 cancer killer of women. This week a major financial supporter of breast cancer education and services, the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation, announced it was ending its funding to Planned Parenthood. While Planned Parenthood believes Komen is caving in to pressure from anti-abortion groups, Komen said its decision was made because the foundation is not allowed to give money to any organization under government investigation. An article in The Los Angeles Times said this was a reference to ""an inquiry begun by Rep. Cliff Stearns, a Florida Republican, to determine whether Planned Parenthood uses public money to fund abortions,"" an accusation Planned Parenthood has heard before and denied repeatedly. When Komen announced it was cutting Planned Parenthood funds, it failed to mention that it recently named Karen Handel senior vice-president for policy. She ran unsuccessfully for governor of Georgia on a strong anti-abortion platform and called for an end to funding for Planned Parenthood in that state. Another abortion foe, Jane Abraham, the general chairman of the anti-choice Susan B. Anthony List, sits on Komen's Advocacy Alliance Board. I have no evidence that they did or didn't participate in Komen's decision. But as ill-advised as it is -- and if comments to Komen's Facebook page are any indication -- I suspect that the decision will not be popular with many women who previously supported the foundation. In fact, by mid-afternoon Tuesday, the story had prompted an outpouring of financial pledges to Planned Parenthood: $400,000 and rising, according to the Washington Post's Sarah Kliff. These supporters understand how important it is to be able to offer free or low-cost reproductive health care, especially to girls and women from low-income families in rural and medically underserved areas. Those of us in the middle and upper income brackets (as I suspect many, if not most, Komen employees and supporters are) visit private physicians. We can afford, if not always easily, regular checkups and driving long distances if necessary. Women with little income don't have these luxuries, which is where Planned Parenthood health centers come in. A clinic can be virtually a one-stop shop, where a woman might come for a Pap smear, birth control pills and a breast examination all on the same visit. While mammograms and biopsies are referred out to other doctors at low or no costs, Planned Parenthood physicians oversee the cases. Women also learn in the clinics how to examine their breasts for cancer. Without Planned Parenthood and similar organizations, the people most in need of this care would be the least likely to get it. This is not the America I know. We've gotten along -- one could say prospered, even -- as a country of diverse views by finessing our differences. You believe this, but I don't. I believe something else, but you don't buy it. We forge a common ground. I can't think of one organization I've belonged to or given money to with which I agreed 100% on every issue. But that hasn't stopped me from supporting good work that that organization does. If only Komen operated the same way. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Citing an escalation in violence, the Arab League called off its monitoring mission in Syria this weekend. The announcement came just days after the Syrian government agreed to a one-month extension of the mission. The sudden change in policy ""surprised"" the government, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. It also signaled a new phase in the Arab League's handling of the crisis. In November, the Arab League voted to suspend Syria from its ranks. A couple of weeks later, it initiated sanctions against the country. One month later, monitors were sent in. The next step appears to be a U.N. Security Council resolution. The council is set to consider a draft resolution, presented by Arab League member Morocco, that calls on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down and transfer power. ""The Arab League have now exhausted their own internal options and they can be seen to have taken action themselves to try to resolve the crisis,"" said Chris Phillips, a Middle East professor from Queen Mary, University of London. ""It would now seem legitimate for the Arab League to now turn to larger bodies, certainly the U.N., to take action itself."" The Arab League, aka the League of Arab States, was created in 1945 to promote closer relations -- politically, economically, culturally and socially -- among its members. The first group consisted of six Arab countries: Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Transjordan (now Jordan). Since then, it has swelled to 22 members, including the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Arab League is one of many regional unions worldwide. These type of groups, such as the African Union, the Union of South American Nations and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, involve neighboring countries trying to work together for the good of the whole. For much of its history, however, the Arab League has been viewed as a toothless organization, Phillips said. He told CNN he was surprised when 18 of its members voted in favor of suspending Syria. ""The Arab League will still be seen as the agent of brutal, corrupt regimes: Of the 22 Arab League member states, only three members are even vaguely democratic, and of them only Tunisia has had internationally recognized free and fair elections,"" he said in November. ""But the decision does show that now the Gulf states may have to start recognizing the power of the ballot box in its relations with neighbors."" Q&A: Where is Syria crisis heading? Early last year, the Arab League suspended Libya's membership, condemning Moammar Gadhafi's regime for attacking peaceful protesters. Within months, the U.N. Security Council voted to impose a no-fly zone over the country, and Gadhafi was history soon after. Are we now witnessing a stronger, more assertive Arab League? ""We've seen this organization move toward the idea of intervention on behalf of the people, which is something they steadfastly would not do in the past, almost no matter what,"" said Paul Kinsinger, a professor at the Thunderbird School of Global Management who spent 19 years working for the CIA. Kinsinger says the Arab Spring has clearly sent a message to the powers-that-be. ""I think there is a sense that they have to be on the right side of the issue more than they have wanted to be in the past, or else they suffer potential increasing irrelevance in that part of the world,"" he said. Before recent interventions in Libya, Yemen and now Syria, many of the Arab people didn't take the Arab League seriously, said Mohamed Alsiadi, a native of Syria and coordinator of the Arabic Language and Cultural Studies Program at Fordham University. ""We did not even look at them,"" Alsiadi said . ""But I would say they're gaining more momentum from the mainstream. ... Finally, we can see a serious Arab League that can take initiative and help the Syrian people."" Alsaidi said he and many other Syrians are still taking a cautious approach, as the Arab League still has much to prove and it remains to be seen what becomes of the U.N. resolution. But it's clear that there has been a meaningful shift. ""We may see (the Arab League) as weak-kneed and autocrat-loving and -protecting, turning the blind eye to all kinds of excesses going on in their countries,"" Kinsinger said. ""But we have to also understand that this is a vastly different part of the world (not familiar with) participatory democracies. They're busy taking baby steps on a long road, and over the last year they have taken a significant journey on this road. ""The mere fact that the Arab League and other Arab leaders have become more willing to intervene on the behalf of people's safety, security and well-being in one another's countries is a significant step forward."" CNN's Nick Thompson and Peter Wilkinson contributed to this report.","For much of its history, the Arab League has been viewed as a weak regional power .
The group has come down hard on Syria, however, suspending it in November .
After sanctions and a failed monitoring mission, it is now turning to the U.N."
"(CNN) -- Greg Smith left Goldman Sachs yesterday. After more than a decade at the firm, the executive left in a bit of a huff. The culture of Goldman Sachs, Smith complained in a New York Times op-ed, is ""toxic and destructive."" It was not always so, he says. Indeed, Smith insists, a decent ""culture was [Goldman's] secret sauce."" But then Lloyd Blankfein and Gary Cohn ""lost hold of the firm's culture,"" with the result that this ""decline in the firm's moral fiber represents the single most serious threat to [the firm's] long-run survival."" Moral fiber is no doubt important. So, too, is culture. But it is a mistake to understand culture without also understanding incentives. The culture that Smith praises was the product of a firm with a particular legal form, in a particular financial environment. At just about the same time, both particularities changed. And given these changes, it is no wonder that the culture Mr. Smith celebrates soon disappeared. For most of its history, Goldman Sachs was a partnership. That meant the principals were jointly and individually liable for the losses of the firm. And for most of its history, Goldman Sachs operated in a relatively boring financial environment. Low risk and low reward. No doubt there was money to be made. But regulations designed to keep the system safe meant that the real money in that economy got earned by people who made real stuff. In the 1990s, however, both conditions changed. Goldman Sachs went public in 1999, though the partners kept 48% of the stock themselves. And the regulations that had kept finance boring had all but disappeared by the time Goldman's IPO was issued. These changes increased the market opportunity â€” radically. They also increased the market pressure on financial firms â€” radically, as well. Bold (and sometimes reckless) experiments (""financial innovations"") created incredible opportunities for firms like Goldman to profit. Persistent and relentless pressure from a publicly traded stock pushed employees to experiment more boldly still. Ticking across every employee's computer was the firm's stock price, a constant market signal of how they were doing â€” up, good; down, bad. Those signals in turn were driven by the behavior of competing firms. Another view: Attack on Goldman misfires . Recklessness by a competitor may produce higher profit in the short term. But the (nontransparent derivatives) market couldn't easily distinguish between profit driven by recklessness and profit driven by better management. The consequence was a kind of teaching-to-the-test. Behavior (however reckless) that produced the right signals from the market got rewarded. When that wasn't enough, more and more, as Smith puts it, ""people push the envelope."" But you can't negate the effect of these two changes with a simple injunction to ""Be Good!"" Being good would be great. But we won't get great (or even mere good) until we change the incentives that drove Wall Street off the cliff. We must, in other words, re-examine the changes that brought about this bad climate. Robert Reich, for example, has long argued that ""professional companies should not be permitted to become publicly held corporations."" As he puts it, ""Such a step puts them into high-stakes competition for investors, pushing them to maximize profits over their responsibilities to the public."" (Not to mention their client.) Take away the stock ticker, in other words, and you make it easier for the traders to do (long-term) right. Likewise with financial innovations. If we're going to keep these instruments as part of our financial system, then we obviously need to increase the regulatory oversight that would keep at least a rational firm in check. Not just the rules to regulate risk, but the punishments for behaving badly. If rewards are greater, then penalties need to be greater, too. At least if we're to avoid the kind of culture that Smith so powerfully criticizes. None of this means that strong moral fiber and the right culture aren't important. They are. Since at least Adam Smith we have known that markets with good morals are more efficient than markets without. But we cannot rely upon the gossamer threads of being good when having more money than God is the reward for being bad. Good law is needed, if good culture is to have a chance of return. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lawrence Lessig.","Goldman Sachs executive quits, blaming the firm's culture .

"(CNN) -- The king of the South Pacific nation of Tonga died ""peacefully"" Sunday at a hospital in Hong Kong, a Tongan government official said Monday. He was 63. A cause of death has not been released by the government. ""Tonga has just woken up to the sad news of the passing of King George Tupou V,"" said Paula Ma'u, an official in the Ministry of Information and Communication. ""We are all in mourning."" Ma'u said Crown Prince Tupouto'a Lavaka, heir to the throne, was with the king ""just before he passed away."" Pesi Fonua, editor of Matangi Tonga online news website, said the Oxford-educated king was known for his world travel and spending habits, but was also respected for his efforts to bring democratic reforms and modernize Tongo. ""This king brought in things like mobile phones and other advances that we couldn't dream would come to Tonga, and his push for democracy made a big impact on the people here,"" Fonua said. However, he said, Tongans had ""mixed feelings here in the community"" about the king. ""He lived a bachelor life, always a single man, and he traveled a lot around the world and spent money. He brought us in some ways forward into the 21st century, but some people have different -- not as good -- views on him."" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her condolences in a statement Monday, crediting George V with guiding ""his country through a critical process of constitutional change towards the establishment of a constitutional monarchy."" Tonga, with a population of 106,000, is the only monarchy that remains in the Pacific. George V ascended to the throne after the death of his father in September 2006 and quickly promised to speed up government reforms demanded by the people. ""Let us rebuild a new capital and a new Tonga,"" George V said in 2006, a week after a pro-democracy rally in the capital city of Nuku'alofa led to riots that left eight people dead and the central business district in ruins. In 2008, he announced he was giving up most of the near-absolute power that his family held for centuries and allowing the prime minister to guide the day-to-day governmental affairs. Tonga is an archipelago of 171 islands directly south of Western Samoa. Less than a third of the islands are inhabited. The present dynasty was founded in 1845 after the Tongan islands were first united.

"(CNN) -- Ethiopian forces attacked military posts in neighboring Eritrea to target ""subversive groups"" it said operate within the country, reigniting tensions between the two archrivals. The ground assault Thursday struck bases used to launch attacks aimed at destabilizing Ethiopia, said Shimeles Kemal, an Ethiopian government spokesman. Such attacks are ""organized, supported and financed by the Eritrean government,"" Kemal said at a news conference. The Eritrean foreign ministry described the incident as a ""provocative attack"" and said it was intended to divert attention from Ethiopia's continued ""illegal occupation"" of Eritrean territory. The raid ""is part and parcel of the numerous unlawful and provocative attacks that have been going on intermittently in the past 10 years,"" the statement said. The assault 16 kilometers (10 miles) into Eritrean territory reignites tensions between the two nations, which fought a two-year war from 1998 that left 80,000 dead. They have all but severed diplomatic relations since then. The military incursion was partly in retaliation to Eritrea backing groups responsible for atrocities in Ethiopia, the spokesman said, including a January attack that killed five Western tourists. Two other Germans were kidnapped in the northern region attack blamed on the Ethiopian rebel group, the Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unit Front or ARDUF, which the government accuses Eritrea of backing. Kemal said Ethiopia prefers to settle disputes with its neighbor through peaceful dialogue but stressed the nation will not 'hesitate to take proportional retaliatory action"" if Eritrea launches more attacks. Eritrea won its independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year war. Before the war, it was classified as a province. CNN's Ashley Gallagher contributed to this report.","NEW: Eritrea says its neighbor staged a ""provocative attack"" on its soil .

"(CNN) -- A blue car rushes by in the raging brown water. Moments later a whole family house is carried down the center of the flooded street before an even more frightening sight: a young man trapped in the rising water clinging to a telephone wire. ""Gambatte kudasai!"" screams out a young voice to the stranded victim, which means ""stay strong"" in Japanese. That voice belongs to 16 year old Mao Takahashi, who used his camera to record the moment the tsunami struck his neighborhood in Ishinomaki, Japan, on March 11, 2011. Send in your memories of Japan's tsunami . It is riveting to watch and has been viewed more than two million times on YouTube. When asked if he felt as if he was recording history for a global audience, Takahashi said he did not think about what he was doing or that he might be recording a piece of history. ""I was simply panicking,"" he explained. In Japan every person in the country has at least one mobile phone and when the tsunami tore across northern Japan, thousands like Takahashi pulled out a device from their pockets and started filming, making last year's disaster one of the most recorded in history. ""Because you had all of this very real footage, it made the incident much more real in people's minds. They no longer have to imagine what a tsunami is, they saw it live,"" said Tokyo-based technology consultant Steve Nagata. Nagata points out that Japan is recognizable to many people, even if they haven't visited the country. That familiarity helped people around the world connect to the disaster. The personal nature of the video also brought the disaster home to people around the world and compelled nations and individuals to engage and want to help, said Nagata. ""To be able to do this in near real time and to do it to audiences across the globe is unprecedented in how much power it's giving to individuals,"" Nagata said. In Takahashi's case, what his video doesn't show when he stopped recording is the most important part of his story. Takahashi took off his clothes, fearing their weight when they got wet and waded into the frigid waters, which had subsided as the tsunami retreated. He then grabbed the young man clinging to the telephone wire -- who was just a few years older than himself -- and carried him back into his house. He doesn't know what happened to the young man, other than he survived. Takahashi and his family are now living in temporary housing and their future is still uncertain; he doesn't know where they will finally end up. He still likes to look at the video that's still on his camera, even though it shows the fury of that traumatizing day. ""It has a happy ending for me,"" he said.","Mao Takahashi recorded moment tsunami struck his home town of Ishinomaki .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan says it is liaising with the governments of Yemen and Saudi Arabia before it decides when to deport several of Osama bin Laden's family members of back to their homelands. The detention of the terrorist mastermind's three widows and two daughters ended Tuesday night. But as of late Wednesday, there were no signs that they had left the Islamabad house where they were held. A judge had ordered earlier this month that the five women be deported back to their countries of citizenship after serving their sentence for living illegally in Pakistan. Two of the widows are Saudi while one is Yemeni. The widows -- identified by U.S. and Pakistani officials as Amal Ahmed Abdul Fateh, Khairiah Sabar and Siham Sabar -- have been in Pakistani custody since U.S. Navy SEALs raided bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad and killed the al Qaeda leader in May 2011. ""We have written to both the embassies and we have also sought the consent of the family members,"" Rehman Malik, the Pakistani interior minister, said Wednesday. Islamabad will make a decision on when to deport the women ""once we have reply from the respective embassies,"" he said. But the Yemeni foreign minister accused Pakistan of delaying the departure of Fateh, the Yemeni widow. ""We are the ones pushing for the release of the family and Pakistani authorities have been stalling,"" Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, the Yemeni minister, said Wednesday. ""The Yemen ambassador in Pakistan has been working around the clock seeking the release of the family, and Yemen is ready to accept them at anytime,"" he said. The authorities in Saudi Arabia, where the other two widows are from, have repeatedly declined to comment on the matter. Bin Laden spent years on the run in Pakistan after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, moving from one safe house to another and fathering four children with Fateh -- at least one of whom was born in a government hospital, she told Pakistani investigators. A deposition taken from Fateh gives the clearest picture yet of bin Laden's life while international forces hunted him. He and his family moved from city to city with the help of Pakistanis who arranged ""everything"" for them, Fateh said, according to the deposition. She told police she never applied for a visa during her stay in Pakistan. CNN's Shaan Khan and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.","The detention of the widows and daughters of Osama bin Laden has ended .

You're now in Manoa Valley, which gets 150 inches of rain a year. The ideal way to soak up the scenery is to hike the mile-long path up to the 100-foot-tall Manoa Falls; the trail, framed by bamboo, winds under a rain-forest canopy (hawaiitrails.org, parking $5). 6 p.m. While most of Waikiki's sunset-watching spots feel either stiflingly formal or cringingly cheesy, the Mai Tai Bar at the Royal Hawaiian hits a kitschy sweet spot, thanks to hula dancers and live, lilting Hawaiian music (2259 Kalakaua Ave., royal-hawaiian.com, mai tai from $10).

DAY 2 . 9 a.m. The island's scenery changes dramatically -- and fast -- when you head east out of Waikiki on Kalanianaole Highway, the main road along the eastern (windward) coast. The 761-foot-high volcanic crater known as Diamond Head immediately rises in front of you, and beyond that, the Jurassic Park--style landscape makes even the most articulate person utter embarrassingly inane statements like ""Amazing!"" and ""Wow!"" The two-mile-long trail to Makapuu Lighthouse calls for its own set of exclamations (hawaiistateparks.org/hiking/oahu, trail #6). Perched at the edge of a cliff, the lighthouse is bordered by steep ridges covered in jungly vegetation. Noon Kalanianaole Highway breezes past farms, ranches, and the occasional house. The lack of development is refreshing -- until you need a cold drink. That's exactly what gave Pat Shea and David Campbell the idea to open Sweet Home Waimanalo (6), a little shop with slow-smoked barbecue, fish tacos, and smoothies (41-1025 Kalanianaole Hwy., sweethomewaimanalo.com, tacos $8). 1 p.m. You can look out on 75-degree, turquoise water for only so long without desperately needing to dive in. It's worth holding out for Kailua Beach, about five miles north of Waimanalo. While the beaches leading up to Kailua have thinner strips of sand and strong tides, here the sand is broad and wide, and the water is calm enough for kids. Rent a double kayak from Kailua Sailboards & Kayaks and paddle out to the Mokulua Islands -- known as the Mokes -- a pair of mini mountains about 1.5 miles off the beach (130 Kailua Rd., kailuasailboards.com, half-day rentals from $49). Dinner As soon as you hit the town of Kahuku, North Shore shrimp trucks (oversize vans) line the road. An under-the-radar favorite is Fumi's Kahuku Shrimp Truck, about half a mile north of Kahuku (56-781 Kamehameha Hwy., fumiskahukushrimp.com, dishes from $10). The shrimp is harvested every morning, and there are nine variations, but the only two worth ordering are butter garlic and spicy garlic. Beware: This is messy business: your hands will be covered with garlicky butter by the time you're finished. Don't be shy about using the big outdoor sink to wash off. Overnight Each of the 11 units at Ke Iki Beach Bungalows comes equipped with a full kitchen and a barbecue, and teak chairs and benches are spread out on the grounds, set right on the beach (59-579 Ke Iki Rd., keikibeach.com, from $145). DAY 3 . 11 a.m. The hikes along the coastline get all the acclaim, but a landlocked trail in the middle of the island is worth its own hype. The Aiea Loop Trail in Keaiwa Heiau State Recreation Area covers more than four and a half miles of terrain. Take in views of Pearl Harbor, the Waianae Range, Diamond Head crater, and, if you squint hard enough on a clear day, a bit of Honolulu (hawaiistateparks.org/parks/oahu, park # 8). Lunch Don't be fooled by the tired-looking façade at the Waimalu Shopping Center; it houses some of the best food on the island. Shiro's Saimin Haven serves 60 versions of saimin, a noodle soup unique to Hawaii, with Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino influences (98-020 Kamehameha Hwy., saimin from $4). And it's definitely worth stopping by Baldwin's Sweet Shop to stock up on dried and preserved fruits flavored with li hing, a sweet-salty seasoning (98-040 Kamehameha Hwy., 808/488-0505, dried fruit from $1.50). Airport detour La Mariana Sailing Club, on a marina off a gravel road three miles from the airport, is one of the area's last standing authentic tiki bars (50 Sand Island Access Rd., 808/848-2800, cocktails from $3.50). The 52-year-old spot has a refreshing grit amid its polished neighbors. And the decor -- some original, some donated by tiki casualties -- is traditional all the way: blowfish lamps, wooden posts carved with threatening faces, and fishing nets draped from the ceiling.

"(MNN.com) -- If your pet suffers from arthritis, prescription medication isn't the only solution. Holistic options such as acupuncture, chiropractic medicine and rehabilitative therapy can reduce the need for medication, while significantly improving your pet's quality of life. Veterinarians Evelyn Orenbuch and Susan Wynn offer information about greener treatment options for arthritic pets. Keep pets moving . ""Just getting the joints to move, a lot of time, decreases the pain and increases joint fluid,"" says Orenbuch, a veterinarian certified in chiropractic and canine rehabilitative therapy. At Georgia Veterinary Rehab, her state-of-the-art facility, four-legged patients get laser therapy and massages or undergo low-impact rehab sessions on an underwater treadmill. Treatment options focus on increasing flexibility and strength while decreasing pain. When pets struggle with arthritis, Orenbuch frequently recommends a solution that begins at home: Keep pets active and monitor their weight. It's no secret that extra pounds add pressure to joints, but fat cells also carry other hidden dangers. ""The more fat you have, the more inflammation you have,"" says Orenbuch, president of the American Association of Rehabilitation Veterinarians. ""If you've got a joint that's inflamed, even more of the inflammation and inflammatory factors tend to find their way there."" Interactive toys, extended playtime and healthy treats can help your pet drop excess pounds and relieve achy joints. Helping your pet lose weight is an important and inexpensive first step in treating arthritis. MNN: How to help your pet lose weight . Consult your vet before making dietary changes . As a nutritionist with Georgia Veterinary Specialists, Wynn promotes dietary changes that can improve a pet's health. But consult a veterinarian before you load up on glucosamine, sardines, fish oil or other foods associated with joint health. Fish oil can be effective, Wynn says, but pets need high doses that could add extra calories. ""When you start to talk about sardines or fish oil, you may be increasing fat in an older dog, which can be a problem,"" she says. ""Talk to the vet if you are changing diet at all. No one has reported severe side effects with glucosamine, but talk to the vet about dosages."" Holistic treatments for arthritis also include the use of herbs, which Wynn describes as ""specialized food for very specialized cells."" When treating pets for arthritis, she often prescribes herbs in conjunction with acupuncture. This approach removes the risk of side effects typically associated with anti-inflammatory drugs. ""I will talk about all the options,"" she says. ""Acupuncture, herbs, physical therapy and diet changes can help."" MNN: 15 healthy dog treats . Ask about new treatment options . There's no shortage of unique options to treat arthritis. Prolotherapy, one of the newest nonsurgical trends in veterinary medicine, involves regular injections of dextrose and other substances, such as lidocaine and vitamin B12, to stimulate cell growth and strengthen joint tissue. According to Orenbuch, prolotherapy irritates tissues to cause a small amount of scarring, which increases stabilization of an unstable joint. She notes that prolotherapy and rehabilitation also have been used to treat ACL tears in lieu of surgery. ""There have been a few studies here and there that suggest it has an effect on modulating pain, but it's not often effective alone,"" Wynn says, noting that most patients require a multi-faceted approach. ""With an older, 13-year-old dog, I might start two things at once -- maybe herbs for two weeks then acupuncture for two weeks."" Acupuncture involves more than needles . The ancient Chinese practice of acupuncture has gained popularity for its ability to enhance healing and pain management, in spite of skepticism about its results. The process involves inserting needles into specific points on the body, releasing the flow of energy and promoting balance. ""Whether you want to go by double-blinded studies or anecdotally, we have all seen enough results to tell you it works,"" Orenbuch says. ""We know from Western medicine that a lot of those points are over major nerve centers, and release chemicals that help the body to heal and counteract pain."" Wynn notes that most pets tolerate the procedure without issue -- yes, even cats. Many show improvement a few minutes into the treatment, and sessions can range from five to 30 minutes. Her facility sets a comforting tone for pets during visits by using pheromones or lavender oil to keep them calm during each session. At Georgia Veterinary Rehab, soft lighting and soothing water features set the tone for stress-free acupuncture sessions. MNN: Remembering the dogs of the Titanic . It pays to start chiropractic care early . Chiropractic care promotes proper alignment of a pet's musculoskeletal structure through regular adjustments. Orenbuch often combines acupuncture and chiropractic care when treating patients. ""Your goal is to make sure that every joint has full range of motion,"" she says, noting that there are seven joints between each vertebra of the spine. ""As long as those are moving properly, then the nerves that come out from the spinal cord are going to be able to function better."" Be honest about your financial situation . Holistic options such as acupuncture or rehabilitation can be costly, but most doctors will customize treatment plans to fit your budget as well as your schedule. Be honest about your finances during the initial consultation and ask for more than one option to address your pet's arthritis. ""If someone comes in with dog that I think needs to come two or three times a week for rehab and they can't afford it, then they can't afford it,"" Orenbuch says. ""Once a week is better than nothing, and then let's talk about what you can do at home."" Holistic approaches can significantly relieve symptoms of arthritis, but Wynn warns clients to keep expectations in check. ""With a lifelong disease like arthritis, you are not curing it,"" she says. ""The length of treatment depends on the severity of the disease and other conditions."" Find a holistic veterinarian near you .

"(CNN) -- Not in a long time has the pre-Super Bowl chatter been so dominated by one player's body part. But Sunday's game in Indianapolis has turned into the saga of the injured ankle of New England Patriots superstar tight end Rob Gronkowski. While pundits are split on who will clinch the big game between the Patriots and the New York Giants, most agree that the Patriots will be severely hobbled if Gronkowski can't take to the field. Gronkowski suffered a devastating ankle sprain in the Patriots' playoff win against the Baltimore Ravens on January 22. Last week, he was sporting a protective boot over his ankle that he took off Monday, but was still unable to practice most of the week. At media day Tuesday, Gronkowski said he wasn't sure if he could play Sunday. ""I don't know yet,"" Gronkowski said. ""I am not really worried yet if I am playing or not. We're going day by day. I am taking new steps every day. I am feeling better every day. That is a positive sign. I want to be out there with the team obviously. "" Gronkowski tallied 17 touchdown catches this season - an NFL record -- and is a match up nightmare for any defense. He stands 6-foot-6 and packs a hard-to-handle mix of power and speed. He could be the Patriots' most valuable player after quarterback Tom Brady. The dominating conversation about Gronkowski's status is reminiscent of the lead up to the Super Bowl game in 2005 when then-Eagles wideout Terrell Owens miraculously came back from a severe ankle injury to play in the game. He caught nine passes for 122 yards, but the Eagles lost the game to the Patriots. That was also the last Super Bowl the Patriots won. The Pats have appeared in the big game more times than any other team since 1986, and is only the second team in the game's history -- after the Dallas Cowboys -- to win three Super Bowl championships in four years. Seven years later, the Pats are hoping to do it again. ""Gronk is in the training room every day trying to get ready,"" Brady said. ""He wants to be there. He's going to work his butt off to be there."" Giants defensive lineman Justin Tuck hopes not. ""Hopefully that ankle hurts a little more than everyone expects it to and he is not as versatile as he has been,"" Tuck told ESPN. ""You talk about the talent that he is, he had probably the best year for a tight end ever."" No matter what the Patriots do on offense, the key for the Giants lies with their defense, pundits say. The Giants beat the Patriots in 2008 Super Bowl, throwing cold water on the Pats' undefeated season. In that game, the Giant's ferocious defensive line rushed Brady and sacked him five times. ""No one has been able to figure that out all year,"" said Brady, referring to the Giants' defensive line this year. ""They can rush the quarterback really well and hopefully we can slow them down somehow. They are ready to go and ready to take my head off.""","Patriots star tight end Rob Gronkowski hurt his ankle earlier in the playoffs .
He says he does not know if he will play .
""Hopefully that ankle hurts,"" Giants' Tuck says .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A Taliban commander expressed skepticism that one soldier carried out a massacre last week that left 16 Afghan civilians dead, and anger that the suspect subsequently was flown out of Afghanistan. ""We don't think that one American was involved,"" the Taliban official told CNN, refusing to give his name or be otherwise identified. ""The foreigners and the puppet regime (in Afghanistan) are blind to the truth of what happened here. ""But if this was the act of one soldier, we want this soldier to be prosecuted in Afghanistan, and according to Islamic law. The Afghans should prosecute him."" Stunned friends recall suspect's good deeds . The commander also explained that the Islamic fundamentalist group had halted talks with U.S. officials. It had set up an office in Qatar on January 3 to reach ""an understanding with the international community"" and discuss specific issues with American officials. In a statement Thursday, the Taliban said work from their Qatar office was being suspended, a decision made due to what the group called U.S. officials' ""alternating and ever-changing position."" Preliminary talks had already begun over the exchange of prisoners, the Taliban said. The Taliban commander said the burning of Qurans in February by U.S. troops and issues surrounding the U.S. possibly transferring five Taliban members from the U.S. prison facility in Guantanamo Bay to Qatar were the main reasons for the decision. ""The peace talks with the Americans were limited to discuss the prisoner deal. And those promises were not kept by the Americans,"" he said. The Taliban official had harsh words for the U.S. regarding the March 11 rampage in two villages in the district of Panjwai in Kandahar province, though he did not tie that directly with the group's decision to suspend talks. A resident of one of the villages, Ali Ahmed, described to CNN how what he and some others claimed were multiple attackers had come into a home before dawn that morning, asked his uncle where the Taliban were and then shot him dead. ""Finally, they came to this room and martyred all the children,"" Ahmed said from the home, claiming a 2-month-old child was among the nine children killed. Later, he said some of the dead were piled in a room and set on fire. U.S. officials have said that one man, Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, left his outpost and singlehandedly carried out the massacre in two villages. He is currently at the U.S. military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, pending trial, having flown back to the United States last week. The incident, as well as the fact the suspect isn't set to be tried in Afghanistan where the crime occurred, has infuriated many Afghans and heightened tensions between that nation and the United States. After the shooting spree, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said that relations between the two countries were at the ""end of the rope."" The incident came weeks after U.S. troops burned Qurans at a coalition base in Afghanistan, sparking outrage and fierce protests across the central Asian nation. Yet Afghanistan's ambassador to the United States insisted Sunday that his nation trusts the U.S. investigation into the rampage. ""We do trust the United States and we do know how important this relationship is, and we are working as a partner to resolve all the issues as a partner,"" Ambassador Eklil Hakimi told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. Hakimi said both the shooting rampage and Quran burning are tragic, but he acknowledged they come after more than 10 years of a U.S. presence in his country that has claimed the lives of more than 1,700 U.S. troops, according to the official U.S. military count. ""We do understand sacrifices that our allies, especially our main allies, the United States -- that they have suffered quite a lot, those men in uniform, those women in uniform,"" Hakimi said. ""Those are the things that we are grateful (for) and we are appreciating that."" U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta promised Karzai a full investigation and said the United States will bring the shooter to justice. ""He accepted that and hoped that it could be a transparent process so that the Afghanistan people would see that the U.S. is indeed going to not only prosecute this individual but ensure he's held accountable,"" Panetta said after meeting Karzai on Wednesday. ""I also indicated to him that we take these kinds of incidents seriously. We need to look at just exactly was involved here that caused this terrible crime,"" Panetta said. ""Was it related to combat stress? Other factors? We need to pay attention to those so it won't happen again."" The shooting prompted Karzai to demand that foreign troops pull back from their outposts in Afghan villages and confine themselves to military bases. In his meeting with Panetta, Karzai also demanded that the transfer of security responsibilities from Washington to Kabul be accelerated. Family friends who knew Bales, the shooting spree suspect, growing up in the Cincinnati suburb of Norwood, Ohio, described him as ""quiet"" and ""very nice."" The Army said that he enlisted in the military two months after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Bales went on to serve four combat tours, the last one to Afghanistan beginning in January. And in between them, he settled down with his wife and their two young children near Joint Base Lewis-McChord outside Tacoma, Washington. The family owned a townhouse in a modest, middle-class neighborhood in Auburn, about 30 minutes from the base, before purchasing a house in 2006 for $280,000 near Lake Tapps, according to realty records. Tim Burgess, whose Auburn townhouse shared a wall with that of the Bales family, on Sunday described his former neighbor as ""a really good guy (who) just wanted to serve."" ""I know he just wanted to go back and serve overseas, that was his goal,"" Burgess recalled from their conversations, while noting the two hadn't spoken in about five years. Robert Baggett, president of the Riverpark Homeowners Association, said Sunday that -- after the Bales family moved to Lake Tapps -- there were occasionally renters in the residence. But several years ago, their townhouse was foreclosed upon, according to Baggett and Burgess. The Bales also didn't pay homeowners association fees for ""at least three or four years,"" said Baggett. ""We don't know what happened,"" Baggett said of the Bales and their Auburn property, which Sunday had a notice that read ""Do Not Occupy"" on its front door. One of Bales' lawyers, John Henry Browne, said upon arriving at the Kansas City, Missouri, airport -- where he'd come so he can drive to meet with his client -- that all the reports surrounding Bales have been a ""shock"" to those who know him as a ""very mild mannered person and a great person."" Browne added that the entire situation was unique and challenging. ""You couldn't imagine a more difficult case, I don't think,"" the lawyer said. ""This case has political ramifications, it has legal ramifications, it has social ramifications."" CNN's Sara Sidner in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Paul Vercammen in Auburn, Washington, contributed to this report.","NEW: ""You couldn't imagine a more difficult case,"" Bales' lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- A roundup of reactions to the death of television producer and longtime ""American Bandstand"" host Dick Clark, who died Wednesday: .

"(CNN) -- Occupy protesters succeeded in shutting down overnight operations at California's port of Oakland on Monday night after a day of similar protests in several other U.S. cities. The protests in Oakland have ""disrupted workers trying to get to work and impaired the port's ability to operate,"" port spokesman Issac Kos-Read told CNN. Craig Merrilees, a spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, said the port has told its members not to report for work for the overnight shift because of the mass of protesters at the port. Earlier Monday, the port authority said in a statement there were ""some delays of truck traffic"" but said the port remained operational. On a normal night, several hundred people would be working the graveyard shift, Kos-Read said. Day shifts involve several thousand, he said. He said the protests have cost workers their wages, cost the city and region some revenue and could cause shipping firms to divert vessels to other ports. ""What has this accomplished?"" he asked. ""This is disrupting the 99%"" Oakland has been a flashpoint of the Occupy movement since October, when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown. One demonstrator, a Marine veteran of the war in Iraq, suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile, according to a veteran's group; police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers. The ILWU -- which represents 15,000 dockworkers -- has distanced itself from the protest movement. The union ""shares the Occupy movement's concerns about the future of the middle class and corporate abuses,"" ILWU President Robert McEllrath wrote to locals last week -- but he urged the movement to stay out of its dispute with the port of Longview, Washington, and warned against ""outside groups attempting to co-opt our struggle in order to advance a broader agenda."" Monday's demonstrations also took place in Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston and Portland, Oregon. Organizers said the goal was to shut down ports in an effort to ""disrupt the economic machine that benefits the wealthiest individuals and corporations."" In Houston, police arrested 20 protesters after dozens of police on foot and on horseback confronted a somewhat larger group of Occupy protesters who blocked an interstate on-ramp, authorities said. Groups of up to six protesters lay down on the pavement and interlocked arms and legs, while a larger group stood near them yelling protest slogans. Officers set up barricades to cordon off protesters in an attempt to free the ramp for traffic. The majority of the protesters could be seen moving behind the barricades, with a few exceptions, including those who had lain down. Police handcuffed some protesters and led them to a police vehicle. Six face felony charges of using criminal instruments to block a public roadway, said Houston Police Department spokesman Victor Senties. In Long Beach, California, protests caused isolated traffic delays but did not hinder port operations, according to Police Chief Jim McDonnell. ""Two arrests were made -- one for resisting and one for failure to disperse, as well as a number of traffic citations issued to pedestrians,"" he said. About 80 protesters demonstrated outside the gate of San Diego's port, but caused no disruption, port spokesman Ron Powell said. ""They were there at a time when we really didn't have a lot of truck traffic coming in and out,"" he said. Four people who sat down in the road were arrested, he said. San Diego police did not immediately return a telephone call seeking information on the arrests. A spokesman for the port in Portland said the protests had partially shut down the port there. In addition to the West Coast port blockades, demonstrators in Salt Lake City and Denver said they were planning to disrupt operations of Walmart distribution facilities. About 40 to 50 people protested at the Denver facility, CNN affiliate KCNC reported. The demonstrations were part of a nationwide day of protest called in the aftermath of efforts by cities across the country -- including New York, Boston and Oakland -- to clear demonstrators from encampments they had set up in public parks and other locations. ""We are occupying the ports as part of a day of action, boycott and march for full legalization and good jobs for all to draw attention to and protest the criminal system of concentrated wealth that depends on local and global exploitation of working people, and the denial of workers' rights to organize for decent pay, working conditions and benefits, in disregard for the environment and the health and safety of surrounding communities,"" organizers said on their website. The port protesters are focusing on terminals owned by SSA Marine, saying it is owed by the Goldman Sachs investment firm, which they argue exemplifies corporate greed and is anti-union. SSA Senior Vice President Bob Watters disputed the protesters' claims, saying Goldman Sachs owns less than 3% of an investment fund that has a minority stake in the company. He also said the company is the largest employer of International Longshore and Warehouse Union members on the West Coast. In a letter to members sent last month, International Longshore and Warehouse Union president Robert McEllrath said the organization shares Occupy protesters concerns about what they consider corporate abuses, but he said the union was not sanctioning any shutdown. Protest organizers said on their website that they were acting independently of organized labor only because the unions are ""constrained under reactionary, anti-union federal legislation."" Some port workers are also against the planned blockade. ""I'm just barely getting on my feet again after two years, and now I gotta go a day without pay while somebody else has something to say that I'm not really sure is relevant to the cause,"" trucker Chuck Baca told CNN affiliate KGO. Port officials say shutting down their facilities will only cost workers and their communities wages and tax revenue. ""Protesters wanted to send a message to the 1% but they are impacting the 99%,"" said Portland port spokesman Josh Thomas. The stoppage is resulting in ""lost shifts, lost wages and delays,"" he said. Port of San Diego board chairman Scott Peters issued an open letter to the community on Sunday asking that protesters not disrupt work. ""The Port of San Diego is made up of working people with families who serve the public each day by helping to bring in goods that are important to the people of the San Diego region,"" Peters wrote. ""They are the 99%, the gardeners, the maintenance workers, the dock workers, the Harbor Police officers, the office workers, the environmental workers -- all working to improve the quality of life in San Diego Bay and on its surrounding lands,"" he said. ""It is these people who would be hurt by a blockade of our Port.""

"(CNN) -- All this month, we will see thousands of college students from coast to coast, north to south, east to west, jumping up and down, yelling, screaming, pumping fists, sleeping outside in tents, painting their faces -- all a result of the usual frenzy surrounding March Madness. That's the scene we see every year when college basketball teams are fighting and clawing their way to one of the precious 65 seeds that enter the NCAA Tournament. But instead of doing all of that for basketball, these same students should say the heck with the games and put their energy, zeal and passion into two fundamental issues posing the most dramatic barriers to their college education: the rising cost of tuition and the lack of financial aid. On Thursday, we saw students begin this process by leading rallies in cities nationwide to protest rising tuition costs. While our political leaders in Washington, D.C., are decrying the rising cost of health care, college tuition is exploding across the nation, from community colleges to technical schools to four-year public and private schools. Education leaders say it's all about the economy, but when the cost of tuition is jacked up as high as 30 percent in some states, and so many parents are without jobs or are facing wage cutbacks, their children see no hope. Often they postpone school or cut back on hours they take per semester -- delays that keep the student from being able to graduate and find a good-paying job. But marching and demanding a rollback of student tuition is just one front of the battle that students in college and high school should be waging. The other is fighting the banking lobby, which is spending millions of dollars on members of Congress to keep them from changing financial aid laws. The Obama administration has proposed eliminating the substantial subsidies banks enjoy for handling most of the federal college loans processed, with virtually no risk. Federal officials say the banks are reaping upwards of $9 billion a year in these subsidies, which include interest collected, and the Obama administration wants to push more of that money to students by increasing Pell grants and Perkins loans. Estimates have put the cost savings to taxpayers at more than $80 billion over the next 10 years. The changes also limit the maximum that students would pay to 10 percent of their income and would cut 10 years off of their repayment if they took a public service job. The rationale is simple: If the federal government is already assuming the risk of loans, and no substantial data have been presented to show that the banks are truly making a difference with their loan counseling services, why not cut out the middle man, like Sallie Mae, and free up more money for students? Reining in this perk for the banks won't lower the cost of college, but it will make it easier for many students or parents to pay for it. There are some grass-roots organizations fighting the banks, such as the United States Students Association, but they are going up against entrenched interests, and some of those are university officials. In some cases, the banking industry has used its financial power to wine and dine college officials, lavishing gifts, golf trips and other perks to keep them in line. So some of the very folks who should want students to get as much money as possible to stay in school are not always operating in their best interests. So here you have two fundamental roadblocks facing students, and too many are only complaining about them and not focusing on action. Some even suggest they have no power to fight such well-funded interests. I say nonsense. This February, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the civil rights movement sit-ins, which were launched in Greensboro, North Carolina. Four students at North Carolina A&T decided they'd had enough of the segregated lunch counters in downtown Greensboro. So they politely walked in and asked to be served. When refused and thrown out, they came back. And back. And back. When word of their efforts spread, it was as if a wildfire had been sparked across the South. Black students in other Southern towns began to do the same, and lunch counter by lunch counter, drugstore by drugstore, department store by department store, Jim Crow was assaulted by the zealous actions of just a handful of students. Over the course of our history, it has always been the nation's young who took to the streets, statehouses, college campuses and the halls of Congress to demand change. It worked then, and it can work now. It's time that we see college students, high school students who are looking forward to college, and the parents who are bearing the burden of paying for it, join those who are still paying back student loans to identify the banks that are fighting changes in the financial aid system and do the following if those banks persist: . • Remove your money from their coffers. If these banks are fighting against your best interests, they don't deserve your account. Take it to a community bank that will support your efforts. • Stage pickets and sit-ins. Imagine what would happen if thousands of students fanned out across a city and picketed and actually led sit-ins in the banks. Yes, shut them down. • Rally the masses online. Today's generation is far more proficient at text messages, social media and online video. Instead of talking about the latest celebrity news, use online media to galvanize and build a national movement. • Hit the hallways of Congress and state legislatures. The heck with going skiing or hitting the beach during spring break. If they are still in session, come up with a list of legislators not fighting rising tuition or who are in the pockets of Sallie Mae and the banks. Send throngs of students from each district and make it clear that you will organize young voters and parents in those districts and throw them out of office if they continue to allow the banks to run roughshod. • Engage celebrities in the battle. Kanye West, Jay-Z, Beyonce, Ashton Kutcher, P. Diddy and so many others have millions following them on Twitter and Facebook. It's time to enlist them in this battle. Students, basketball is wonderful, and seeing your team in the Big Dance is great. But if tuition keeps going up and less money is available in the form of financial aid, you'll be cheering from afar because you won't be able to keep going to that school. For America to be strong, we must cultivate, teach and train the next generation of leaders. Students, the time for talk is over. The time for action is now. Many of you went to the polls to vote for Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain. Election Day 2008 was not the end, but the beginning. If you want change, then you better work for it. Put those fervent minds to use in battling those who don't have your best interests at heart. Let the fight begin.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Air Force disciplined 15 senior officers, including six generals and nine colonels, for their roles in the mistaken shipment of nuclear weapons components to Taiwan, Air Force officials announced Thursday. Air Force Secretary Michael Donley and Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz explain the Tawain nuke probe. The administrative reprimands were in response to an investigation ordered earlier this year by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. That probe reviewed the service's intercontinental ballistic missile program after the 2006 shipment became known. The review team, led by Navy Adm. Kirkland Donald, was charged with determining accountability for the shipment. The announcement of the accountability findings was made to reporters at a Pentagon news conference Thursday by acting Air Force Secretary Michael Donley and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz. Both men were involved in deciding what action each officer would face. ""We carefully evaluated the evidence, both that which we derived from the Donald report and other documentation, associated documentation. And we came to the conclusion on what the appropriate sanctions were,"" according to Schwartz. ""There is a differentiation of sanction involved for these individuals. And some are significantly more serious than others,"" he said. Army officials also announced in a written statement that two Army generals were reprimanded for poor logistics in the supply chain, bringing the total number of officers punished to 17. The Taiwan incident was one of four known nuclear weapon mishaps. In July, a truck carrying an unarmed missile booster tipped over in North Dakota. The vehicle, which was carrying a Minuteman III rocket booster, tipped on its side on a gravel road about 70 miles southwest of Minot Air Force Base. The crew suffered minor injuries. That same month, the Air Force announced that three officers fell asleep July 12 while in control of a classified electronic part that contained old launch codes for intercontinental nuclear missiles. It happened during the changing out of electronic parts used to communicate with Minot Air Force Base. And in August 2007, a B-52 bomber flew from Minot to Louisiana with the crew unaware that six nuclear-tipped missiles were onboard. Of the six Air Force generals reprimanded for the Taiwan incident, one requested retirement after receiving the most severe administrative punishment, a letter of reprimand, according to an Air Force statement. Two other generals had already filed for retirement before they received letters of admonishment, according to the statement. Two other generals receiving less severe letters of admonishment will remain in their command. Because of their level of knowledge and understanding of nuclear weapons and command issues, they are considered vital to their missions, according to Schwartz. ""They have unique skills and capacity to serve. And we came to the conclusion, after a careful evaluation, that we could place our respective trust in their continued service,"" he said. ""They certainly are on notice that there is no room for error here and that, should they abuse this trust, it won't take but about a millisecond to react."" A sixth general received a letter of admonishment but had been reassigned before the report and will remain in his current command. Of the nine colonels disciplined, two were given letters of reprimand and removed from command. Three others were given letters of reprimand but left their positions before the review came out and will remain in their current positions. Three more colonels received letters of admonishment. One was removed of command, one was reassigned before the report and will remain in the new position, and the third will be retained in his current position. The ninth colonel received counseling for failing to execute effective command oversight and remains in his current position. Privacy regulations do not allow the military to name officers below the rank of general who receive administrative punishment. The Air Force provided the following information on the generals involved: . -- Lt. Gen. Kevin J. Sullivan received a letter of reprimand for not adequately addressing logistics policy deficiencies and for not correcting known problems in his position as Air Force deputy chief of staff for logistics, installations and mission support. He was also cited for not exercising effective command oversight while serving as commander of the Ogden Air Logistics Center. He has requested retirement. -- Lt. Gen. Michael A. Hamel received a letter of admonishment for not effectively exercising responsibility and for not correcting recurring deficiencies while commander of the Space and Missile Systems Center and Air Force Program Executive Officer for Space. He had previously requested retirement. -- Maj. Gen. Roger W. Burg received a letter of admonishment for not exercising effective command oversight and for not correcting known problems in shipping sensitive components in his current position as commander of 20th Air Force. Donley and Schwartz determined that Burg is needed to restore effective stewardship of the ICBM force, and he will remain in command to continue corrective actions he has initiated. -- Maj. Gen. Kathleen D. Close received a letter of admonishment for not exercising effective command oversight, for not recognizing weaknesses in management of sensitive components, and for not correcting known problems previously identified problems in her current position as commander of the Ogden Air Logistics Center. Donley and Schwartz reached the same determination on her as on Burg. -- Brig. Gen. Francis M. Bruno received a letter of admonishment for not exercising proper oversight and for not correcting known problems in his position as director of logistics for Air Force Materiel Command. He previously requested retirement. -- Brig. Gen. Arthur B. Cameron III received a letter of admonishment for not identifying and correcting deficiencies in operations involving sensitive components, for not ensuring proper control of such components, and for not correcting known problems while he served as commander of the 309th Maintenance Wing. He was routinely reassigned at the normal end of his tour and remains in that position.","Punishment for 6 generals, 9 colonels ranged from letters to command removal .

"(Mashable) -- Windows 8 won't be ready for consumers until fall, but that's not stopping hardware makers from fighting to be first in line to build hardware for Microsoft's new operating system. Lenovo is planning to be the ""first to market"" with a Windows 8 tablet, The Verge reports. Citing a ""source,"" the report says Lenovo is planning to be ready to ship the device in October and that it will have an Intel chip, so it clearly won't be a Windows-on-ARM device. Other than that, there aren't any details on exactly what the machine will be, although given those basic criteria (tablet, Intel, Windows 8), there's at least one suspect: the IdeaPad Yoga. Lenovo showed off the Yoga at CES earlier this year, and it got a lot of attention due to its unusual form factor: a laptop with a keyboard that folds over completely to transform it into a tablet. Mashable: How windows 8 tablets could challenge the ipod . Michael Dell had also said publicly that Dell would offer a tablet when Windows 8 launches, and Nokia recently confirmed months of speculation that it was working on a tablet as well. There have also been reports that HP and Asus are working on Windows 8 tablets as well. A key differentiator among Windows 8 tablets will be whether they're based on a traditional PC chip or one that uses the ARM architecture. While the new version of Windows has been engineered to be near-identical on both, ARM-based Windows devices are going to be ""end-to-end"" devices (meaning Windows would come fully integrated) and have a few special features, like an ultra-low-power mode. However, most legacy apps won't work on them. Are you interested in Windows 8 tablets? What would you like to see in them? Let us know in the comments.

"(CNN) -- If you think I'm one of these folks who are upset with James Jones, the Florida father who jumped on his daughter's bus to confront the bullies who were terrorizing her, you've got another think coming. In fact, we should recommend Jones as Father of the Year. Jones was caught on tape angrily yelling at the children on the school bus who he felt were bullying his 13-year-old daughter, who has cerebral palsy. He later issued a tearful apology, saying he was wrong. No, James, you weren't wrong, the punk children who bullied your daughter were wrong. And the punk parents who didn't discipline their own children are wrong, too. I can sympathize with James because I witnessed my dad do the exact same thing when I was in middle school. Some students on our bus were rough-housing one day and another kid pulled down the sweater of a girl, exposing her breasts for all to see. This kid's name was Roland. Now, I had nothing to do with it, and two of us didn't even look alike, yet when friends and family of the girl heard about it, they assumed it was me. More than 40 kids were on the bus and they all knew that wasn't the case, but her supporters didn't care. My brother and I were threatened repeatedly with physical harm, and we clearly didn't want to ride the bus home. So we made up a reason to not take the bus and begged our father to pick us up. When he got to the school and demanded to know the truth, he got out of the car and jumped on the bus and said, ""Point out to me who keeps messing with you."" Now I may have been scared of the school bullies, but I was more scared of my daddy! So I told him and he walked over to a kid and asked him, ""Are you messing with my sons?"" He made it clear we had nothing to do with what we were accused of and said he didn't want to hear about this one boy hurting us. So this kid pulled out a knife on my dad and threatened him. My dad laughed, snatched the knife from him and said, ""Don't you ever do that again to me or anybody!"" He then looked every kid on the bus in the eyes and made clear that he'd better not hear one story of them bullying his sons or he would be back. Suffice to say, no one messed with the Martin sons again. More opinion articles on issues in the news . But my dad wasn't the kind of person who would protect just his own sons like that. He was the kind of person who would travel around our Clinton Park neighborhood and break up kids fighting, even following some home to talk to their parents and grandparents. He was never afraid to go to other parents and hold them accountable for the actions of their children, and more often than not the parents were stunned to hear about their kids being bullies and disciplined them themselves. Bullying has always been around in schools, so that is nothing new. What is different today is that kids are committing suicide because of the constant taunting. We can have all of the town hall meetings about bullying, but what is going to change all of this is to have teachers, administrators and other parents get in the face of parents and guardians and make it clear to them that they must discipline their own children and teach them not to be bullies. Children must understand that there will be repercussions for their actions. When I have witnessed one of my nieces hit and push around her sister or one of their cousins, I've taken immediate action and intervened. As the grownup, I don't even wait for their mother and father to say something. I'm their uncle, and as an adult I won't allow that behavior to set in. Bullying does not have go along with reading, writing and arithmetic in our schools. It can end immediately if we are willing to hold to account those most accountable -- the parents. And if the parents don't want to step up, then other adults must be willing to stand up. Children have enough on their minds in school without having to deal with being bullied. None of us should pass this off as ""what kids do"" when it is resulting in the suicide of even one child. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","James Jones should be nominated as Father of the Year, Roland Martin writes .

"(CNN) -- As a strong proponent of parental responsibility, it both amuses and angers me to see some parents lining up behind an initiative to sue McDonald's over the inclusion of toys in their Happy Meals. The Center for Science in the Public Interest is leading the charge in this case, pushing the state of California to ban the toys, suggesting that the toys in Happy Meals are inducing children to eat burgers and fries, thus contributing to the obesity epidemic in America. As I asserted a few weeks ago in my column supporting First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative, I fully back efforts to end obesity among our children. But at what point do some folks use common sense? For example, in a story in the Chicago Tribune, parent Monet Parham said her 6-year-old daughter was so enamored with toys offered in partnership with the movie, ""Shrek Forever After,"" she pestered her mom to collect every toy. That would mean going to McDonald's every week, since the promotion was a giveaway each week. And that's not something Parham wanted. So instead of being a parent and telling her child, ""no,"" Parham decided to become a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Instead being the grownup and not giving in to the demands of a 6-year-old, Parham thought it made more sense to sue McDonald's to make her job as a parent easier. I've long maintained that the problem today isn't children or the world changing. It's punk parents changing. Yes, I know that's a strong phrase, but when a parent can't control a 6-year-old, then we have some issues. Do I have any biological children? Nope. But my wife and I at different times have raised six of my nieces. And when they lived in our home, we would take them to McDonald's for a Happy Meal. And when we went, instead of fries, we would order them apples. Instead of a soda, we would get apple juice or milk. Yes, it was that simple. All we did was ask for the healthier options on the menu, and the girls were happy with their Happy Meals. Why is this so hard? There is a fundamental role government can play when it comes to nutrition. Going after the cigarette makers who enticed children with cartoon characters to smoke? Good. Limiting trans fats in cooking? No problem here if it makes us healthier. But this is ridiculous. What we desperately need today are real parents. Parents who understand that it is not their job to be friends with their children but be parents. Parents who get that having a disappointed child who doesn't get his or her way all the time isn't a bad thing. Parents who will give their child the right look when the child begins to act a fool and throw a tantrum. I am not one of these adults who subscribe to the notion that no one can tell them what to do and they can do it all. For instance, I support sex education in schools and don't believe that we should leave that up to the parents. It's called education for a reason! Count me as a major supporter of schools changing their menus to have healthier eating options. And I'm also down with school uniforms. The heck with the peer pressure of the haves and have nots based on designer clothes. None of these prevent parents from doing what they want to do with their children. It's all about focusing on the broader needs of the child. What has to be understood is that a lawsuit isn't the answer to everything. And if we want our children to be healthier, banning a toy will do nothing to make that happen. Push McDonald's to make healthy options more visible on the menu. I love the idea of having calorie counts on foods. It has changed my mind on many occasions as to what to buy in a fast food restaurant. Push fast food joints to have a health menu option by adding a salad, fruit and/or water instead of fries and a fountain drink. All of these make sense. Trying to ban a toy because a parent can't tell their child no is ludicrous. My nieces and nephews know full well that when it comes to who is in control, Uncle Ro Ro doesn't play around. I'm not their friend or buddy; I'm their uncle. What I say goes. I don't negotiate. I don't consult. I don't give in. I make it clear: my money, my rules. As my dad told me, ""When you're grown enough to pay all of your bills, you can make the call."" If a niece or nephew wants to go to McDonald's every week for a month just to get a toy, and the deal is we only go once a month, here is the option: ""We go once a month or not at all. Your call."" Trust me, even the biggest child pest has enough sense to figure out that once a month is the better option. Parents, buck up and be the adult in the family, and stop blaming everything on an outside agency or corporation. Maybe McDonald's should think of suing sorry parents for not doing their job. Now that's a lawsuit I'm willing to support. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Lawsuit asks California to ban Happy Meals, saying they encourage poor eating habits .

"(CNN) -- In November 2010, I watched ""HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel"" and saw a piece on the hazing antics at several historically black colleges and fraternities. I took to Twitter to share my thoughts on the issue. Much of the report focused on Southern University, and man, did the floodgates open as a number of students from the university angrily tweeted me back, cussing, yelling and screaming, with some defending hazing, while others were angry at the national attention focused on their university. For hours we went round and round, and were joined in the discussion by members of several black fraternities, including my own Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. A number of these individuals actually supported hazing, or ""pledging hard"" and not becoming a ""paper"" member who ""skated"" into the fraternity. Despite the anger and vitriol, I refused to back down, making it clear that getting beaten for being in a band or fraternity was absolutely dumb. One year later, when news of the death of Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion became public, I immediately thought of that discussion and those folks who viewed hazing as a ritual worthy of continuing. Here was a young man who went off to college, planning to earn a college degree while leading one of the nation's most colorful and exciting bands, only to be returned home to his parents in Georgia in a coffin. While hazing immediately was suspected, we could only speculate about the cause of the 26-year-old's death. That is, until Friday, when the medical examiner released details of his autopsy, concluding that Champion ""collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body."" News of the death has rocked the Florida A&M campus, angering its students and alumni, triggering multiple state investigations and leading Gov. Rick Scott to call for the suspension of school President James Ammons. That prompted FAMU students to march to the governor's mansion on Friday and camp out on his lawn, demanding he rescind the resignation call. Champion's death isn't the first time we have seen individuals in a band or fraternity die. It is incredible that some folks have given their lives -- literally -- for just being a part of a student group. State laws have been passed, organizations have been kicked off campuses and national fraternal and sorority groups have paid millions in settlements because of hazing, but we continue to see these stories. ""Why?"" is a consistent question that is asked, and at the end of the day, it boils down to power and a desire to demand others kowtow to someone else's demands in order for them to be accepted. A decision not to follow through means you can be ostracized, ignored and marginalized. That's the last thing any young person wants to experience when in an organization. Every one of these organizations is overseen by adult leaders or advisers. But in truth, fellow students run the show. Normally in a band, a drum major sits at the top of the food chain, but Champion clearly had to bend to the band's culture to be fully accepted as a member of FAMU's ""Marching 100."" So what you have is a bunch of students between the ages of 18 and 22 calling the shots and making it clear who is accepted and who isn't, who gets in and who doesn't. You aim to please them and no one else. Oftentimes they are leading based on how they were led, and it has been indoctrinated into them that this is the way of life, take it or leave it. These are powerful forces that can only be changed by peers. Hazing will only be brought to a close when members of organizations make it clear the vile hazing traditions will not go forward. No one today can be hazed if the student leaders make it clear that it's unacceptable. Yet because of the natural turnover in student organizations, that mindset has to be created and passed on for it to succeed. When I was about to pledge Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. in spring 1989, I met with my four other pledge brothers and made it clear: I'm not getting hit, I will never use alcohol and I will not agree to be hazed. Even though my older brother pledged the same fraternity at Texas A&M two years earlier without any nonsense, I was making it clear that such shenanigans were idiotic. All five of us agreed and in the four weeks, two days, 16 hours, 38 minutes and 39 seconds I was on line (yea, having to recite such specifics was a part of our process), the behavior that we often heard was associated with pledging didn't exist. Yet because of that, we weren't always as accepted by other fraternity members at other campuses. Our chapter was called soft; we were criticized as not ""pledging the right way"" and had to constantly defend our manhood. Me, I didn't give a damn. I would look others in the eye and say, ""In the history of our chapter, only one brother has failed to graduate, and we do nothing with him. Are you guys on the six- or seven-year plan, and can you match our graduate rate?"" From my perspective, we were supposed to be in college to graduate, not to pledge. And if my fraternity was founded as a study group at Cornell University on December 4, 1906, why would we eschew academics? Even though we pledged the right way at Texas A&M, that peer pressure was still unbearable for some. That summer at our national convention in San Antonio, hazing was on the agenda, and I made it clear I was going to speak. Some other brothers in my chapter pulled my coattails and said, ""Don't tell the brothers you didn't take any wood (that's being paddled)."" I yelled, ""If we pledged brothers the right way, why in the hell are we afraid to say it?"" Since those days, I've never wavered from my anti-hazing position. It is deplorable and shameful to think that someone would beat another person for them to prove something. Prove what? They can take a punch? No. I prefer to challenge his mind, his intellect. Our goal as fraternity men is to take young men and mold and shape them to be better men. It is not our aim to take young men and train them to be collegiate mercenaries, hellbent on inflicting as much pain as they got onto the first person they have control over. Is there tremendous value in fraternities, sororities, bands and student organizations? Absolutely. The leadership opportunities are tremendous, and the lifelong relationships are vital. But what has to be preached and preached and preached to every student, whether they are white, black, Asian, Latino, male or female, is that if they love that frat, sorority, drill team or band, they shouldn't do anything to jeopardize it for the next person. Do we need tougher hazing laws? Yes. Do we need universities to take punitive action, including kicking students out who break the rules? Yes. Do we need national organizations to ban chapters for years for egregious behavior? Absolutely. Should fellow student leaders turn in others who break the rules and haze? Of course. There must be a zero tolerance attitude from every state official, administrator, student leader and organization member. To hell with tradition, rituals and ""the way we do things."" All that must end. Now. But we also must raise a generation of young people who have enough confidence in themselves to say, ""I will not take a beating just to be accepted by you. I'd rather not have your affection or support if it means putting my life on the line."" And if that means other students calling you out or teasing you, fine. I'd rather you talk about me like a dog today than be hazed and have my friends search to figure out what to say at my funeral.

"(CNN) -- As a second-generation caterer, I would ordinarily be peacock proud and hyena happy about the prospects of anyone getting married. Yet when I saw the obese coverage around the wedding announcement of Britain's Prince William and his fiancée, Kate Middleton, I felt it was sickening to watch. There was no one television broadcast or cable network that was more egregious than the other. Frankly, all were shameful with the level of attention given to the announcement of next year's nuptials. It's wrong for anyone to suggest that Prince William isn't a newsmaker, but this wedding is more entertainment than politics or hard news. Yet this was the lead story on NBC's evening newscast? Really? It was more perplexing considering the announcement was reported on the same day that President Barack Obama awarded the first Medal of Honor to a living soldier since Vietnam. With the United States engaged in two wars, and so much attention being put on our soldiers, it made perfect sense for the national media to turn everyone's attention to one of our own, Staff Sgt. Salvatore Giunta of Iowa. After the royal engagement coverage, how can today's journalists seriously complain about the softening of news and about more Americans caring about gossip and photos of celebrities walking down the street to buy a cup of coffee rather than paying attention to the news that truly affects their lives? Look, I get the mammoth ratings from the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana in 1981. But what we have seen this week has been ridiculous. More opinion on topics in the news . In the media we often talk about news judgment. It is all subjective, based on the person or persons who make the decisions in each respective newsroom. I can guarantee you that if I had my own TV show or was an executive producing one, the royal wedding wouldn't have made it into the first block. No doubt it would have been mentioned, but it would have been beyond me to put a wedding announcement of a royal couple from another country at the top of an American newscast. Longtime journalist Ted Koppel recently blasted the opinion-driven TV shows on Fox and MSNBC, and Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia went so far as saying the two should be shut down. Frankly, I find the latter to be nonsensical, but it is important that we sometimes step back and say, ""Are we contributing to the dumbing down of the public by virtue of some of our dumb news decisions?"" Let me be clear: There is a place for sports, entertainment and lifestyle-related stories. I disagree when someone suggests that such stories aren't news. They are news, just a different type of news. But there is such a thing as overkill, and when it came to the royal wedding announcement, my brothers and sisters in the media embarrassed themselves with the over-the-top coverage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland Martin: Media coverage of engagement of Prince William was over the top .

"(CNN) -- Iraq is today a shattered society, shaped by two major international wars, bombings, debilitating sanctions, civil war, emigration of millions of its best-educated people, deadly insurgency and counterinsurgency and foreign occupation over 20 years. While Iraq never achieved full unity after it was cobbled together by the British in 1920 from three large and mutually alien communities -- the Sunni Muslim Kurds in the northern highlands, the Sunni Muslim Arabs in the central plains and the partly Farsi-speaking Shia Muslim Arabs in the southern lowlands -- Iraq had made great social and economic progress. By 1990, it was the most advanced of the Arab countries. Now that is all gone. Yet, even today, there is a memory of collective statehood, or Iraqiyah. Some of us who have lived among the Iraqis believe they have a chance to invigorate a new beginning of Iraqiyah but that the return to something like the state that existed before will take years. How is the American withdrawal regarded? My hunch, from having known Iraq and Iraqis of all persuasions for more than half a century, is that most will be happy to see us leave. But, at the same time, they have learned to fear one another, so their politically effective attitudes will vary from one community to the next. Insofar as there are winners from these destructive years, it is the Shiites. With our help, they emerged to control the government and such armed forces as exist. Most of their leaders have lived and studied in Iranian theological institutions, so they see Iran as a friend and patron. More recently, they have made beneficial economic and diplomatic contact with China, Russia, India and members of the European Union. Thus, while the (Shia) Iraqi government realizes that the United States (inadvertently) helped them to power, that time is past, and an anti-Iranian America could pose dangers. Better, they would conclude, that America be gone. For the Kurds, the answer is different. They have benefited from the destruction of the Sunni Arab central government to establish a vigorous mini-state under the Kurdistan Regional Government. The Shia Iraqi regime is unlikely to challenge Kurdish autonomy. And if it manages to keep the giant oil field at Kirkuk, the Kurdistan Regional Government could underwrite its autonomy economically. But, with the Americans gone, the Kurdistan Regional Government faces one danger: their people, as distinct from their state, spill over into Syria, Iran and Turkey. Revanchist movements of Kurds in those countries have brought upon the Kurdistan Regional Government attacks and may bring more severe attacks once the American hand is withdrawn. Thus, the Kurdistan Regional Government should favor at least a strong American influence in their neighborhood. The Sunni Arabs have been the big losers in this long and dreadful conflict. A whole generation of their educated elite have fled the country, tens of thousands have been killed, hundreds of thousands wounded. Most of their property has been looted, seized or burned. The dangers posed by the Shiites are still clear and present. Surely, one would think, despite the memory of the American role in these events, they would like the Americans to stay to prevent the Shiites from further action against them. No, I find that is not true. They, above all other Iraqis, were the nationalists, raised on efforts to eject the British and then to overthrow the British puppets; for them, getting rid of foreign manipulation was always the ultimate objective. So, although they might hope that America's hostility to Iran would spill over into Iraq to their advantage, they share with the Shiites and the Kurds satisfaction that the Americans are nearly gone. But are the Americans really nearly gone? Are any of the hopes or beliefs of the Iraqis likely to be fulfilled? The U.S. is reportedly doubling the size of its embassy personnel from 8,000 to 16,000, with about 200 military personnel remaining to assist them. So long as hostility to Iran remains the governing policy in the Middle East, Iraq remains pivotal. The same geostrategic appreciation, but focused on India and the Gulf oil states, governed British policy in the 1930s and 1940s. There is no sign the basic policy has changed by the move from London to Washington. While at least the more abrasive aspects of the American presence in Iraq are likely to diminish, I believe that in the eyes of all three groups of Iraqis, the withdrawal will be regarded as cosmetic rather than real. In this event, it seems likely that the current friction among at least America, the Sunni Arab rebels and the Shia government will not abate much while the Kurds will continue to cultivate their close but covert relationship with Israel. And if America's relationship with Iran worsens, the Kurds and Americans will draw closer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William R. Polk.","Iraq is a shattered society, yet there is a memory of collective statehood, says William R. Polk .

"Seattle (CNN) -- While snow and ice continued to fall in parts of the northwest, others in the region struggled with the aftermath of the same winter storm -- including floods, slick roads, power outages and avalanche warnings. The system itself remained a threat, with winter storm warnings from the National Weather Service in effect Thursday night for parts of eight states -- Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. Yet fresh precipitation was just one of many continuing concerns. Chief among them was flooding, particularly in western Oregon and southwest Washington. Oregon's capital city, Salem, which is situated along the Willamette River, issued an emergency declaration Thursday afternoon. By then, at least 35 roadways had flooded and the Red Cross had set up a shelter amid fears that the situation will worsen. ""Water levels are projected to continue to rise,"" the city said in a statement, noting that the Willamette River is projected to crest in the city at 30 feet around 4 p.m. on January 20. Flooding is also a concern elsewhere along that river, including in Harrisburg, Corvallis, Albany and Oregon City. The city of Turner was evacuating about 50 families, including 30 to 40 elderly people, said Beth Myers-Shenai, spokeswoman for the Marion County Emergency Coordination Center. A shelter was also being set up as a precaution in the nearby town of Aumsville, she said. Floods contributed to a car accident in Albany on Wednesday night, said Wanda Omdahl, a spokeswoman for the Albany Fire Department. One car full of people drove into deep water and was swept into a canal. An adult and child were rescued, and a child's body was recovered, CNN affiliate KPTV reported. Fire officials still haven't said how many people are missing. Zach Williams told the station that he and a friend saw the driver steer into a swollen creek, perhaps thinking it was a road. ""I did what I thought I could. I tried to open the doors. The doors were obviously locked. When he broke the window, I assumed the child in the back was old enough to get out through the window,"" Williams said. ""Apparently, it was just an infant."" People in some mountainous areas were told to be on guard for avalanches. The National Weather Service noted that ""heavy new snow"" falling on top of a ""weak snowpack"" heightened the threat in sections of Washington, Montana, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. In more populated sections around Washington state, many restaurants closed, hotels full and roads cluttered by fallen trees Thursday. Around Sammamish, south of Redmond, dozens of cars were parked on steep hillsides -- evidently stranded there by drivers. And CNN affiliate KOMO showed images of overturned vehicles and carports and awnings that collapsed under the weight of the snow. Even after the worst of the snow and ice had passed, electricity outages remained a major headache. Approximately 230,000 Puget Sound Energy customers were without power as of 4 p.m. Thursday, the utility said on its Twitter feed. The company said it had over 750 workers on the job, adding that ""an additional 140 power line crews from other parts of the country will be assisting (with) repairs and restoration work."" ""We can't make full estimate of how long the restoration effort will take until the ice and snow storm -- and the damage it's causing -- ends and our crews can make a comprehensive assessment of the damage,"" the utility wrote. ""But right now, we think it will be 3 to 4 days...maybe longer."" Around Seattle, city spokesman Bryan Stevens said that about 2,200 households didn't have power late Thursday afternoon. But he said he expects all those to have electricity again by midnight. Pacific Power reported only minimal outages in Washington, California and Oregon, including about 600 around Hood River, Oregon, who were expected to have their lights on again by midnight. Roads remained perilous in large parts of Washington late Thursday, though the situation had improved markedly since earlier in the day. The Washington State Department of Transportation noted, on its website, that disabled vehicles and collisions had caused back-ups on many major highways including I-5, I-90 and I-405. ""Collisions and tree limbs are piling up on state highways,"" the Washington State Department of Transportation reported at midday Thursday on its website. CNN iReporter Lauren Miles said the Capitol Hill area of Seattle, where she lives, received more than 4 inches of snow. ""The streets are not very drivable,"" she said Thursday. ""Most businesses are closed again today. Most hills near me have turned into places to sled instead of drive."" The storm also stranded scores of air travelers Thursday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which got 6.8 inches of snow on Wednesday, shattering a 1954 record of 2.9 inches, officials said. By late Thursday afternoon, all three of the airport's runways were open -- after two of them had been closer earlier -- spokesman Perry Cooper said. But he noted that some flights then were still being canceled, because ice was being removed from 70 to 80 planes that had been parked overnight Wednesday at the airport. Even though the state hadn't received requests for assistance ""so far,"" Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire proclaimed a state of emergency Thursday ""purely (as) a precautionary measure."" The step would allow for the activation of National Guard troops and give state agencies more options to help cities and towns. ""I want to make sure we have every resource available to ensure our communities are safe,"" Gregoire said in a statement. The governor took action to ensure the delivery of dairy products with ""a brief waiver of the restrictions on truck drivers' work hours."" The measure ""is needed now to avoid shipment delays that could mean the loss of nearly $1 million a day for the state's dairy industry,"" Gregoire said. CNN's Sara Weisfeldt, Thelma Gutierrez, Shawn Nottingham, Brad Lendon, Sean Morris and Christina Zdanowicz contributed to this report.","NEW: Flooding is a concern along the Willamette River in Oregon .

"(CNN) -- Initial tests detected blood on a comforter found in a storage unit in Washington state belonging to Josh Powell, the man who police say killed his two sons and himself, according to a document filed Friday. It was not immediately clear who the blood belonged to or how much investigators found on the comforter, which was among the items inside a unit at Western Self Storage in Sumner, Washington. The property report from authorities indicated succinctly that a ""presumptive test"" of the comforter had tested positive for blood. Prior to setting a deadly fire Sunday at his Puyallup, Washington, home, Josh Powell was the only person identified by law enforcement authorities in West Valley City, Utah, as someone they were investigating in the disappearance of his wife, Susan Cox-Powell. According to a search warrant request by Pierce County, Washington, Sheriff's Detective Ryan Salmon, last Sunday ""several people began calling 911 saying they had received e-mails from Joshua Powell, telling them goodbye, that he could not live without his kids, and to take care of several things related to his finances."" Before authorities arrived, Powell is accused of snatching his young sons from a social worker who was delivering them for a supervised visit, locking the door, hacking the kids with a hatchet and starting an explosive fire in the home. The search warrant request noted that the medical examiner's office found ""sharp impact wounds ... on the back of the head of the two children,"" that a hatchet was recovered near their bodies, and that ""accelerant was apparently used on the bodies."" According to the detective, Powell last visited the storage unit on the day before he was accused of committing the double murder-suicide. That same day, he withdrew $6,500 in cash from a bank -- money that is ""unaccounted for,"" the document said. In addition to the comforter, authorities took two plastic bins with miscellaneous items, a box with blocks, a white garbage bag filled with children's clothes and linens, another bag with toys and framed photos from the storage unit. Most of those items were handed over to relatives of Cox-Powell, the property report states. Funeral services for the two slain boys -- Charlie, 7, and Braden Powell, 5 -- will be held Saturday. Josh Powell had said that he last saw Susan in December 2009, after he and his two sons left after midnight to go camping in below-freezing weather in a desert area in Tooele County, Utah. Cox-Powell's sister eventually reported the mother, who would now be 29 years old, as missing. A month later, Powell and his children moved from Utah to Washington.","Washington authorities search a storage unit belonging to Josh Powell .

"Tyler, Texas (WIRED) -- After threatening web companies for more than a decade, Michael Doyle and his patent-holding company Eolas Technologies — named after the Irish word for knowledge — may be finished. An eight-member federal jury in East Texas deliberated Thursday for just a few hours before concluding that all of Eolas' asserted claims of ownership to technology allowing access to the interactive web were invalid. That means the three upcoming trials that were scheduled to rule on infringement and damages, for Google, Yahoo and other companies, have been canceled. The eight defendant companies who resisted the lawsuits won't pay anything to Eolas or its partner, the University of California, for using the web. Eolas maintained its patents entitled the company to royalty payments from just about anyone running a website with ""interactive"" features, like rotating pictures or streaming video. The chief issue in the case was whether the first computer program that allowed access to an ""interactive web"" was created by the little-known Chicago biologist Doyle, who runs Eolas out of Chicago. Or was it one of the web pioneers put on the stand by the defendant companies — such as Pei-Yuan Wei and his Viola browser, or Dave Raggett and his <embed> tag? The dueling teams of lawyers have spent millions creating elaborate presentations, trying for the last three days to convince a jury of average folks in a federal district court in eastern Texas that their side was right. If the jury had upheld the patents, there would have been a potentially brutal damages phase in which Google, YouTube, Yahoo, Amazon, Adobe, JC Penney, CDW Corp. and Staples would have been sued for infringement and been asked for more than $600 million in damages, with the majority of that coming from Google and Yahoo. The Eolas patents were denounced for years before this week's landmark trial, but managed to survive repeated re-exams at the United States Patent and Trade Office. However, Thursday's verdict is likely a setback Eolas can't overcome. It may well be appealed, but that will be a long process, and in the meantime Eolas won't be able to go after new targets. After the trial, Judge Leonard Davis visited with the jurors a while, as is his custom. They were awed, I'm told—as they often are—why such an important web case ended up in Tyler. Apparently they were a little star-struck by Tim Berners-Lee, although you certainly couldn't tell during trial. At ""Rick's on the Square"" opposite the courthouse, defense lawyers were celebrating. There was a giddy atmosphere; these folks truly felt like they saved the Web today. As for the winner's reactions: Yahoo spokeswoman Dana Lengkeek said: ""Yahoo is pleased with the outcome of the case and the jury's decision, and we thank the jury for their time and commitment to this case. Yahoo respects intellectual property and will continue to protect its freedom to operate by defending itself against meritless claims."" Google spokesman Jim Prosser was less effusive. ""We are pleased that the court found the patents invalid, as it affirms our assertion that the claims are without merit,"" Prosser said. Despite winning, Amazon declined to comment. Lead Eolas attorney Mike McKool did not return a call seeking comment. As for the many companies that settled with Eolas, they might be regretting that pragmatic decision in light of the verdict. Those companies include: Apple, Argosy Publishing, Blockbuster, Citigroup, eBay, Frito-Lay, JP Morgan Chase, New Frontier Media, Office Depot, Perot Systems, Playboy Enterprises International, Rent-A-Center, Sun Microsystems (bought by Oracle while this litigation was underway), and Texas Instruments.

"New York (CNN) -- Thousands of miles from a bloody shooting in southern France, Jewish and municipal leaders voiced concerns and vowed to bolster protections for schools, neighborhoods and synagogues while noting they have no indication any fresh, faraway attacks are imminent. Three children and one teacher were fatally shot Monday at the Ozar Hatorah school in Toulouse, an incident French President Nicolas Sarkozy called a ""national tragedy."" Yet its effects aren't being felt only in France. Jewish leaders, law enforcement officials and others around the world have responded with promises that security will be sound and requests that all be on the lookout for suspect activity. Sarkozy puts region on high alert . There has been no evidence, however, that there's any active threat beyond southern France -- where the Toulouse incident was the third fatal attack in 10 days to target minorities. ""Just because there's something that happens there, doesn't mean there are more threats here. But we take everything very seriously,"" said New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. In the United States, an official with the Department of Homeland Security said U.S. authorities are monitoring the situation in France along with European authorities, as well as looking at the prospect of attacks targeting Jews domestically. ""Currently, we are aware of no specific threat to locations within the United States whatsoever,"" said the U.S. official, who asked not to be named. ""As always, we encourage the general public to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to local law enforcement."" Yeshiva University in New York issued a statement saying that ""security concerns have increased as a result of the tragic shooting incident in Toulouse, France"" -- urging people to ""be alert to any suspicious activity or persons."" Farther north in Manhattan at Park East Synagogue, director Benny Rogosnitzky said parents with children at the day school and others going in and out of the synagogue have been asked not to congregate outside. ""It's certainly a concern,"" Rogosnitzky said, noting that the facility is on high alert as often happens after such attacks. New York police have increased security coverage at synagogues and ""Jewish locations"" in the city, Commissioner Ray Kelly said. Earlier, Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne had added that NYPD's Counterterrorism Bureau will assign critical response vehicles to patrol around about 20 Jewish institutions and neighborhoods. Kelly, the department's leader, said there was no specific intelligence regarding threats to places where Jewish people might gather. But he said that increasing security at such locales is ""prudent,"" nonetheless. ""We have a significant Jewish population in this city, and ... we know that we're at the top of the terrorist target list. So we're concerned about the so-called 'copy cat syndrome,' where someone might see the events unfolding in Toulouse and take it upon themselves to act out,"" said Kelly. Similar security measures are being taken in Washington, where Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump said authorities ""have directed that additional attention be provided to schools and religious institutions."" There are increased patrols at Jewish schools, synagogues and neighborhoods in San Francisco as well, said police spokesman Albie Esparza. People around Jewish institutions in New York, at least, said attacks like Monday's in France raise awareness, sympathies and concerns, but it doesn't mean they're expecting it to unfold in their backyard. ""You feel for these people; you would never want that to happen to anybody. But I still feel very safe and very protected,"" said Abby Morris, a preschool teacher at a school affiliated with New York's Central Synagogue. Still, some Jewish leaders said that added precautions are needed in light of the Toulouse and similar incidents. ""In light of the incessant anti-Israel and anti-Semitic rhetoric worldwide, we urge that all Jewish institutions review their security procedures in conjunction with local law enforcement,"" said Dr. Shimon Samuels, director of international relations for the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center. Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said that the Toulouse attack serves as a ""reminder,"" but it does not represent any big shift in the danger or people's attitudes. He cited a poll of 1,754 Americans, released by his advocacy group in November, in which 15% of respondents held ""deeply anti-Semitic views."" If the ratio holds true nationally, that would equate to about 35 million Americans. This is up 3 percentage points from a poll two years earlier. The survey had a margin of error of plus/minus 2.8%. ""Unfortunately, the Jewish community lives in vigilance against terrorism and anti-Semitic attacks 24/7/365 days a year,"" said Foxman. He noted that, before Monday, security precautions were common in synagogues and other Jewish institutions because it is a reality that such hatred exists. If anything, he says, the Jewish community needs to be even ""more vigilant"" in protecting themselves against attacks. ""And it should be vigilant in between acts of terrorism and violence, not just when it happens,"" he added. ""That's part of being Jewish, unfortunately, in our (world)."" CNN's Greg Botelho and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: The Jewish community needs to be ""more vigilant,"" the ADL chief says .

"(CNN) -- Inmates at a prison in Cuba have made a set of hidden-camera videos to expose the conditions there, publicizing the filth and decrepitude of the facilities despite the risk of retribution. ""The conditions here at Combinado del Este are subhuman, and the food is unfit for human consumption,"" says inmate Douglas Moore, who says he is an American convicted of a drug offense. Because he is an American, he says in the video, ""I am singled out for abuse. I cannot count all the times that I have been chained by my hands and legs and beaten mercilessly, then robbed of my meager possessions by the guardia frontera here at Combinado del Este."" He pulls up his pants to show bruises on his leg, and is seen walking with a cane. He points out his cracked and broken sink, and then shows how his toilet is too broken to sit on, so if he wants to use it he has to place a chair frame over it. The videos -- obtained by CNN through a dissident journalist -- show derelict cell blocks overlooking a seedy exercise yard. The grime on the walls is so thick that when an inmate wipes it with a napkin, the paper becomes blackened with filth. Some of the toilets shown are barely more than a hole in the floor. Prisoners, including the narrator, complain in Spanish of dubious food, meager rations, dilapidated cells, moldy walls, overcrowding, and limited exercise hours. They say sewage leaks are persistent. Combinado del Este is a Cuban maximum security prison about 10 miles southeast of Havana. It is believed to hold both ordinary prisoners, like violent criminals and drug runners, as well as political prisoners jailed for criticizing the ruling Castro brothers. Representatives of the Cuban government in Havana, Washington, and New York did not respond to requests from CNN for comment. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it is unable to investigate conditions at Combinado del Este. ""Unlike in many other countries in the region,"" said spokesman Steven Anderson, ""the ICRC does not have access to prisons in Cuba."" But photos from a media tour of the prison in 2004 depicted a far rosier picture, with inmates being taught computer skills and exercising on a lawn. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the videos, obtained through Dania Virgen Garcia, a dissident journalist in Cuba whose blog is called Cuba por Dentro. Two of the 10 videos are posted on a YouTube channel associated with Cuban dissidents. Her blog address is shown on the videos. Garcia said the footage was shot in January using a camera smuggled into the prison. The prisoners who made the tapes may be in danger of retribution, according to Frank Calzon, a Castro critic who is executive director of the Center for a Free Cuba. But this month's visit to Cuba by the pope may shield them from retribution, at least in the short term, he said. And in the long term, he added, the prisoners may believe it is worth the risk to make the videos and publicize their conditions. ""The only hope a prisoner has,"" he said, ""is for the outside world to know about their plight. Getting attention is a way of forcing the government not to mistreat you.""
