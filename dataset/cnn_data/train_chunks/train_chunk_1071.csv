"A 12-year-old boy who died after a . schoolyard attack was punched two or three times in the face and refused . to fight back, investigators confirmed yesterday. An initial investigation into the . tragic death of Bailey O'Neill, from Darby Township, Pennsylvania, has . confirmed claims by his parents that he was the innocent victim of . bullies and an honors student who wanted to avoid trouble. Bailey suffered a concussion, broken . nose and other injuries on January 10 at Darby Township School when two boys jumped him in recess - with one pushing him and the . other landing the blows. Sports fan: Bailey O'Neill loved watching sports with his dad Rob, pictured. Investigators have confirmed he was hit three times in a school attack before his death . Tragic: Bailey O'Neill died aged 12 a day after his birthday . Champion: Bailey's family have spoken of his love of baseball as they paid tribute to the fun-loving youngster . Days later he started suffering violent seizures causing doctors to put him in a medical coma. He had a long battle in hospital but sadly died on Sunday - just a day after his 12th birthday. Since the incident his father, Rob . O'Neill, has started an anti- bullying campaign which has been backed by . Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice. His mother Jini Risoldi has spoken about . how the brief altercation destroyed his health and ultimately claimed . the life of her child. 'He was a perfectly healthy boy before January 10,' she told NBC. 'He was an honor roll student. He was . smart. He was loving. I asked him why he did not fight back and he said . he didn’t want to get in trouble,' she added . 'No more phone calls, no more hanging out, no one to say daddy - it's the worst thing,' Rob O'Neill told ABC News. 'He didn't want to fight that day. He . wanted to walk away. And that's it. He wanted to walk away. It shouldn't . have ever happened. I'm at peace at the fact he doesn't have the pain . anymore - I feel he's safe now, he doesn't have to suffer anymore.' Fun: Bailey with the other members of his Little League team after they racked up a memorable victory . Fan: Bailey, who lived in a suburb of Philadelphia, was a keen sportsman . 'I don't ever want another kid to end up like Bailey,' he added to WPTV. Witnesses at the school had previously reported that Bailey wanted to avoid the fight. But investigators say there is no evidence so far . that the sixth-grader had been builled by the boys in the run up to the . attack. They believe it could have been a one off incident. They say the next stage of their . inquiries will further examine the relationships between the boys and to . decide whether Bailey's seizures were directed related to the injuries . he sustained in the fight. That will decide whether the boys . involved face charges ranging from harassment and simple assault to . involuntary manslaughter. 'We're having trouble showing there was . bullying, as a course of conduct as we define it, intimidation or . harassment between these two boys over a course of time,' Delaware . County District Attorney Jack Whelan said. 'We have not been able to . establish that.' 'The question is, what degree of charge . are we filing? Are we going to be able to establish the seizure disorder . that caused his death is directly related to the punches thrown in the . school yard that particular day?' Bailey's parents say the fight was the . cause of his illness. They took him to the emergency room days after the incident saying he seemed different . and not himself in the days after the concussion before the seizures began. The boys involved also aged 11 have not been identified. The father of the boy who threw the . punches has expressed his sadness for the Bailey family but denied the categorization of his son as a bully. Memories: Those who knew Bailey describe him as a family loving boy who liked sport . Family: This composite image was posted on Facebook in memory of the schoolboy . 'I feel sorry you know,' he told NBC10. 'I don’t know the family, but no one wants death on anybody. I feel . sorry for the young man and I feel sorry for my son because my son’s . depicted as a bully.' He added that his son was 'not the monster everybody is trying to make him out to be'. The two boys were suspended from the school for two days while Bailey was given an ice pack and sent back to class. The Roman Catholic teenager was due to be confirmed on March 18. A tribute from his family said he loved . sports and his family - he has two step siblings, brother Joshua Risoldi . and sister Allyson Risoldi. 'Bailey loved being with his family, he . enjoyed playing and watching sports with his Dad. Bailey also loved . spending time at the beach and on other family outings. Bailey touched . so many lives and was loved by many friends and family. He enjoyed . riding his skate board, scooter, playing video games, baseball with . Briarcliffe A.A. and football with his friends.' His funeral will take place at St. Joseph Church, Woodlawn Ave on Saturday. The Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office is expected to rule on the cause of his death later this month. Southeast Delco School District . Superintendent Stephen Butz said the school is cooperating with the investigation. 'We . take bullying seriously,' he said.  'We are very concerned about the . medical condition of the student and our thoughts and prayers are with . the family and students.'","Bailey O'Neill died on Sunday - a .

"Jeremy Clarkson faced the wrath of Argentinians today by driving through the country in a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL to film for Top Gear. The BBC presenter sparked a new controversy with the 'provocative' plate - a reference to the 1982 Falklands War - while driving part of the famous Patagonian Highway. Leading national newspaper Clarin claimed: 'This is highly sensitive for Argentinians and Clarkson could have problems.' He was also blasted on Twitter with one user telling him: 'Your irony is not funny in Argentina'. Another, using the Argentinian name for the Falklands, tweeted: 'The Malvinas are Argentinian, got that clear?' In the line of fire: Jeremy Clarkson sparked anger in Argentina by driving through the country in a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL to film for Top Gear - a reference to the 1982 Falklands War . News of Clarkson's latest stunt came less than a fortnight after he was reportedly warned by bosses not to cause a diplomatic row while filming Top Gear in Argentina. The 54-year-old responded to those reports with a foul-mouthed Twitter diatribe. Patagonian daily Diario Jornada, echoing the growing anger over Clarkson's taunt, said: 'Top Gear is filming in Patagonia and there's controversy. 'Although the BBC asked the popular presenter Jeremy Clarkson to behave during his trip to Argentina, he chose a Porsche with the provocative number plate H982 FKL.' However, BBC bosses today insisted the choice of number plate was pure coincidence, saying the car was not bought because of its apparent reference nor were the plates swapped. Andy Wilman, Executive Producer of Top Gear said: 'Top Gear production purchased three cars for a forthcoming programme. 'To suggest that this car was either chosen for its number plate or that an alternative number plate was substituted for the original, is completely untrue.' Controversy: Clarkson (pictured earlier this year making a video apology for using the N-word while singing a racist rhyme for Top Gear) has provoked a backlash in the Argentinian media for using the number plate . The apparent goading gesture went unnoticed on the first part of his trip from the ski resort of Bariloche to the southern port of Ushuaia. But he was making headlines again last night in the south American country as he neared the end of his 1,350 mile trek at the head of a convoy of vehicles including a Lotus and Ford Mustang driven by fellow Top Gear presenters James May and Richard Hammond. The car at the centre of the controversy was today reported to be 'hidden' in a shed in a ski resort called Cerro Castor near Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world. The Falkland Islands were taken briefly by Argentina during its 1982 invasion which preceded a 74-day war with Britain. The war claimed the lives of 649 Argentinians and 255 Britons. Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner has attacked Britain repeatedly over the Falklands since taking over power following the death of her husband Nestor. She pledged an 'eternal fight' for the Falklands in one rabble-rousing speech. Under fire: Clarkson has been filming his 1,350-mile trek at the head of a convoy of vehicles including a Lotus and Ford Mustang driven by fellow Top Gear presenters Richard Hammond (left) and James May (right) She begged Pope Francis to intervene in the row with Britain over sovereignty of the islands in the first of their four meetings in March last year. At the start of the year, she handpicked 'yes' man Daniel Filmus to become Argentina's first new Falklands secretary. He labelled the UK as a 'colonial power' at his swearing-in ceremony. The Falklands issue is particularly sensitive in southern Argentina where Top Gear is now being filmed. Ushuaia has blocked several British-flagged cruise ships from docking under a controversial local law named after an Argentinian cowboy who led a bloody 19th century uprising against the British. Jeremy Clarkson was forced to apologise in May after appearing to mumble the N-word as he sang a racist rhyme for Top Gear. TV chiefs in London were said at the time to have summoned him to a meeting and given him a final warning. The controversial presenter arrived in Argentina on September 17 and headed straight for a hotel in Bariloche to begin filming. The Patagonian Highway - better known as Route 40 - is part of a famous road in western Argentina running parallel to the Andes mountains. The Top Gear scenes now being filmed are due to screen in March next year.","BBC presenter drove through Argentina in Porsche while filming Top Gear .

"A murderer has been trying to seduce women from his prison cell using an online dating website. Gavin Ward – who is serving a life sentence for hacking a young father to death with a samurai sword – is reported to have set up a profile in a bid to lure women. The killer is said to have posted photographs of himself posing in jail on the Plenty of Fish site. Looking for love: Convicted murderer Gavin Ward (above) posted photographs of himself posing in jail, where he is serving life with a minimum of 17 years for murdering his friend Christopher Mills in 2006 . Profile: Ward's description said he liked the gym, nice food and wine bars and wants to 'meet new people' His profile is reported to have read: ‘Im looking to meet new people and who knows maybe meet someone special.’ Last night, the Ministry of Justice said any prisoners caught using such websites would face losing privileges. It is understood the profile has now been taken down. Ward, 32, is serving his minimum 17-year term at HMP Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, for murdering his friend Christopher Mills, 22, in 2006. Murder victim: Gavin Mills was killed with a sword . His victim’s mother, Gill, last night hit out at the prison and said Ward should not have been allowed to access the site. She told The Mirror: ‘It is horrific. How could you allow someone who is supposed to be serving life to do this? 'He should get extra time added for this.’ Ward used a different name on his page and said he was interested in going to the gym and visiting wine bars. A Prison Service spokesperson last night said: ‘We have made clear that it is totally unacceptable for prisoners to access social networking sites or instruct others to do so on their behalf. ‘Prisoners should be in no doubt that if they break the rules or access these sites they will be stripped of their privileges and may be reported to the police for further action.’ Last year two prisoners who boasted on Facebook of the easy life behind bars were warned they could have their sentences extended. Sonny Barker and Korrel Kennedy, both 20, posed in their pants in a cell next to a PlayStation and a TV showing a music channel. Between July 2009 and June 2011 342 inmates, including murderers, were caught using the social networking site while locked up..","Gavin Ward, 32, was jailed for minimum of 17 years after 2006 murder .

"Accused: Kishore Nimmala allegedly stole his date's mobile phone when she refused to pay her way at an expensive London bar . A man stole a woman's mobile phone to 'teach her a lesson' after she refused to buy a round of drinks and said she had expected him to pay for their first date at an expensive London bar, a jury was told. Kishore Nimmala, 32, had already spent £54 on two rounds of drinks at a stylish Leicester Square nightspot when he asked Fakhara Sultana to pay for a third. But he lost his temper when she told him she had no money, Southwark Crown Court heard. The pair left the Ruby Blue bar when Nimmala allegedly become angry and Ms Sultana, whom he had met on online dating website Zoosk, told him she was going home. As she walked to Charing Cross Underground station, Nimmala is accused of snatching her white Blackberry phone and running off with it. Helen Thomas, prosecuting, said: 'This case is about a first date that goes badly wrong. 'Ms Sultana informed to defendant that she didn’t have any money with her and that she had assumed that he would be paying for the evening. 'At that point the defendant became angry and so their evening together came to an abrupt close.' The couple then made their way to Charing Cross station with Nimmala allegedly badgering his date for her share of the cash on the way. Ms Thomas said: 'Mr Nimmala kept saying . to her that he wanted the £25 - her share of what he had spent on the . evening- and Ms Sultana kept saying that she didn’t have any money.' Hearing: Nimmala denied one count of theft at Southwark Crown Court . The court heard that when Ms Sultana took her phone from her bag, Nimmala 'grabbed it' and ran. 'Ms Sultana screamed after the defendant and ran after him,' said Ms Thomas. First date: Kishore Nimmala is accused of stealing Fakhara Sultana's mobile phone after a date at the Ruby Blue bar in Leicester Square, pictured . Two . police officers, who were on Charing Cross Road, joined the chase and . caught up with Nimmala on St Martin’s Lane before they witnessed him . throw the phone away. 'When asked why he ran away the defendant said ""she took my money"" adding ""I took her phone"",' Ms Thomas told jurors. In police interview Nimmala told officers that he had spent £54 and he 'wanted her to pay her share'. 'He claimed that she was trying to cheat him and when she got her phone out he took it thinking that she would give him her share of the evening,' Ms Thomas said. 'The prosecution case is that the defendant was fed up having shelled out money on a date that was going nowhere and he decided to teach Fakhara Sultana a lesson by stealing her mobile phone out of spite and causing her maximum inconvenience in doing so.' The court heard that Nimmala does not deny taking the phone without permission, but that the issue is whether or not he did so dishonestly and with the intention to permanently deprive her of the device. Nimmala from Leyton, east London, denies one count of theft. The trial continues.

"An Italian nurse who took photographs of herself with dead patients murdered 'for pleasure' and enjoyed 'the challenge', it has been claimed. Daniela Poggiali, 41, was arrested by officers in Lugo, northern Italy, after the unexpected death of a 78-year-old patient who was admitted with a routine illness. The inquiry was widened to include 38 deaths, ten of which have been described as 'very suspicious'. Scroll down for video . Police are investigating whether hospital nurse Daniela Poggiali (pictured) could have killed up to 38 patients in Lugo, northern Italy. Prosecutors said ten cases were 'very suspicious' - but would be hard to prove . Ms Poggiali allegedly targeted patients she thought were annoying or who were visited by 'pushy relatives.' 'We believe she is sound of mind, but simply took satisfaction, and real pleasure in killing', Alessandro Mancini, the magistrate leading the inquiry told The Times. Police started the investigation following the death of Rosa Calderoni, 78, in April, who was recovering from a broken femur and was admitted to the hospital feeling dizzy. Investigators say that during a post-mortem examination doctors found high traces of potassium chloride, which vanishes after 48 hours, making it hard to detect. It was also found in a drip investigators believe the nurse was using. Potassium can stop the heart and is one of the components used in the lethal injection given to death row inmates in the US. The morning that Mrs Calderoni died was Ms Poggiali's first day shift after she had been switched from nights by doctors increasingly worried about the number of deaths on her watch. Mr Mancini said: 'I believe she saw this change in shifts as a challenge and wanted to show she could kill by day as well.' She put pressure on one nurse to take photos of her standing over a patient who had just died. 'She appears euphoric in the photo, next to someone she may have just killed,' said Mr Mancini. Posting the photo online, Poggiali captioned it: 'Mm... Life and Death.' 'The photos reveal an unbearable cruelty that I have not seen in 30 years on the job,' said Mr Mancini. Investigation: The hospital in the northern Italian town of Lugo (pictured) is at the centre of the probe . Poggiali reportedly gave sedatives to troublesome patients to avoid being disturbed, telling colleagues: 'Don't worry, I will take care of them.' 'The sedatives were possibly a warm-up to her killing spree,' said Mr Mancini. In local reports, one nurse who worked with Ms Poggiali described her as a 'cold person but always eager to work'. Another nurse said she was worried when a relative of the director of nursing at the hospital - a manager disliked by Poggiali - was admitted. 'I had a premonition,' the nurse said. One hour later, he was dead. 'I turned to stone and said to myself, 'Here we go again' .' One claimed Ms Poggiali, who lives with her boyfriend, had once given powerful laxatives to patients towards the end of her shift to 'embarrass' colleagues working on the shift after her. Police say that she had been stealing money from patients. 'When one patient protested, Poggiali replied: 'You've got five euros left and you won't need it.' That patient died a week later,' Mr Mancini said.","Daniela Poggiali, 41, was arrested on suspicion of killing 38 patients .

"The daughter of the judge who jailed police killer Harry Roberts for life said her father would have sentenced him to death had the penalty not been abolished only a year before. Roberts, 78, was sentenced to life in prison for killing three policemen in 1966 as he sat in a van preparing for an armed robbery. But the pensioner is due to be released next week after his case was reviewed by the Parole Board. He has spent 48 years behind bars. At the time of his sentencing Mr Justice Hildreth Glyn-Jones told Roberts 'I think it likely that no Home Secretary regarding the enormity of your crime will ever think it fit to show you mercy by releasing you on licence.' Harry Roberts, pictured right with a security guard, is expected to be released from prison during this week . His daughter, Anne Glyn-Jones, 91, said her father thought Roberts was a 'very evil man,' the Sunday Mirror reported. She added: 'If the death penalty had been in force he would have given it to them with no reservation.' Roberts was found guilty of three murders after a trial, in what the judge described as 'the most heinous crime for a generation or more.' He had been sitting with his accomplices  John Duddy and John Witney in a van near Wormwood Scrubs prison in West London. Mr Justice Hildreth Glyn-Jones would have sentenced Roberts to death had the punishment not been abolished . A £1,000 reward was offered for information leading to the capture of Harry Roberts while he was on the run . The trio had been preparing for an armed robbery when they were approached by the officers and Roberts opened fire with a Luger pistol on the  three unarmed officers. Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, 30, Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25, and Constable Geoffrey Fox, 41, were killed in the attack on August 12, 1966. Roberts shot dead two of the officers and the third was killed by another member of the gang. His accomplices were caught but former Roberts, then 30, remained on the run for 96 days relying on his training as a soldier to survive. His disappearance sparked Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt. Pc Geoffrey Fox, 41, (left), Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25, (centre) and Detective Sergeant Christopher Head (right), 30, were all killed in the attack on August 12 1966 by Harry Roberts and his gang . Roberts, then 30, remained on the run for 96 days – sparking Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt to find him . Roberts was found near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, living in a camouflaged den made out of plastic bags and branches. Pictured is a tent he lived in in Epping Forest, using the survival skills he learned as a soldier . He was found near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, living in a camouflaged den made out of plastic bags and branches. Roberts was given three life sentences with a 30 year minimum tariff. In 2001 Roberts was working on day release from prison at an animal sanctuary where he threatened to kill Joan Cartwright and her husband after she complained about his behaviour. He rang her from prison up to five times a week after learning she had given evidence against him and there were several attacks on her animals at the East Midlands sanctuary. Roberts, Duddy and Witney were sat in a van near Wormwood Scrubs prison on August 12, 1966, planning an armed robbery . They were approached by the three plain clothes unarmed police officers who had suspected there had been a jail escape . Roberts shot at the policemen in Braybrook Street while children were playing nearby . He killed Det Con Wombell and chased and shot Sergeant Head . One of his accomplices then shot Geoffrey Fox . Roberts went on the run for three months and when he was caught he was sentenced to life in prison . His two accomplices are now both dead . Following the threats Roberts lost his bid to be granted parole five years ago. The Parole Board has now decided that Roberts should be released - a decision the Metropolitan Police Federation as criticised as 'a betrayal of policing' by the justice system. London mayor Boris Johnson said the decision was 'sickening.' Ms Glyn-Jones said while her father had been unhappy sentencing some defendants to death, he had felt the abolition of the penalty could put police at risk. She added: 'His view was the police are so much more exposed than anyone else and they put their lives on the line.' Roberts has been deemed eligible for release by the Parole Board which assesses the cases of prisoners who have been sentenced to life in prison once their minimum tariff - in this case 30 years - has passed. For a prisoner to be released they have to be assessed as no longer posing a risk of causing serious harm. He is expected to leave Littlehey Prison in Cambridge in the next few days and then go to a bail hostel. It is understood his name is likely to be changed. The Parole Board said in a statement: 'We can confirm that a three-member panel of the board has directed the release of Harry Roberts. 'The decision to release is a matter for the board, which is independent - arrangements and the date of the release are a matter for the Secretary of State for Justice. We are unable to comment further on the details of this case.'","Harry Roberts murdered three unarmed police officers in West London .

"A Canadian airline has sent a warning to its pilots to stop bringing pornographic material into the cockpit. In an internal bulletin to staff, Air Canada threatened to sack and/or pursue criminal charges against pilots who were caught displaying ‘inappropriate material’ on a flight. The warning was sent to employees after obscene material was discovered while an official with Transport Canada, the national industry regulator, was seated in the cockpit. What's going on in there? Air Canada has warned pilots to stop displaying pornographic material in the cockpit . The bulletin was issued a year ago, but has recently been obtained by CBC News. In the notice, Rod Graham, Air Canada’s chief pilot and director of fleet operations and training, warned pilots: ‘I am disappointed to have to raise this issue once again but unfortunately we have some people that have yet to understand the message. ‘To be clear, this issue only exists on the Embraer fleet and it must stop.’ He said the airline was attempting to identify pilots who were breaking the rules. ‘Once they are identified they will be subject to discipline to the full extent of the law and our corporate policies. This could include termination and/or criminal charges.’ Air Canada management warned that pilots could be sacked or face criminal charges if they are caught . It is not the first time pilots have been warned about the presence of porn in the cockpits of planes. The bulletin circulated last year was issued just four months after an earlier warning, following complaints about pilots’ inappropriate behaviour. A female pilot first started complaining to the Montreal-based airline around six years ago after finding pornography displayed, glued or tucked into areas within the cockpit, CBC News reported. She provided photos and video of the material, including an image where a knife was drawn in the back of a woman, and an Air Canada investigation backed up her claims, but it remains a problem despite repeated warnings. Air Canada says more explicit material was found in February – just months after a bulletin was issued . A Transport Canada investigation revealed that the pilots are not violating aviation safety rules but they are creating a hazard by stuffing ‘paper material’ into compartments with electrical wiring, according to an internal report obtained by CBC News. The report’s author wrote that a complaint that it investigated is considered workplace violence and he or she suggested that the airline didn’t take it seriously enough. Air Canada insists that it has responded with additional training for pilots, although it admitted that more explicit material was found in February – five months after the bulletin was issued to pilots. Airline spokeswoman Isabelle Arthur told MailOnline that only one formal complaint has been filed and there is ongoing labour arbitration. She said: ‘The material in question consisted almost entirely of inappropriate business cards and was confined mainly to one aircraft type and route, our Embraer E-90s operating to Las Vegas. 'It determined the frequency with which such materials were found to be limited. Air Canada has a strict zero tolerance policy to protect its employees against harassment of any kind, including inappropriate materials that may offend co-workers.'","Montreal-based airline sent a bulletin to staff after recent complaints .

"Justin Carroll is the proud dad of a 6-week-old daughter in Tennessee, but thus far he's done his doting via Facetime video phone calls from Africa. Since mid-November, Carroll, 30, has been living in Congo, unwilling to leave until he gets exit papers allowing two newly adopted sons, 3-year-old Canaan and 2-year-old Neema, to travel with him. Carroll and his wife, Alana, 28, are among scores of U.S. couples caught up in wrenching uncertainty, as a suspension of all foreign adoptions imposed by Congolese authorities has temporarily derailed their efforts to adopt. Scroll down for video... Stuck in Congo: Justin and Alana Carroll have adopted two sons from Congo but Justin has been stuck there since November after authorities stopped all foreign adoptions . Religious calling: The couple from Tennessee have been on several missionary trips to Africa and when they had problems conceiving a biological child they decided to adopt from Congo. While most of the families are awaiting a resolution from their homes in the U.S., Justin Carroll and a few other parents whose adoptions had been approved have actually taken custody of their adopted children in Kinshasa, Congo's capital. However, they say that promised exit papers for the children are now being withheld pending further case-by-case reviews, and the parents don't want to leave Kinshasa without them. ‘Justin is not going to leave the boys,’ Alana Carroll, said from the family's home in Jefferson City, Tennessee, where she's been caring for biological daughter Carson since her birth on November 25. Justin Carroll was not present for Carson's birth; he left for Africa almost a week earlier. Pitter-patter: The couple are anxious to bring home their two sons so they can start a nornal life as parents . ‘In a dire situation, we would just move there,’ said Alana, referring to Congo. ‘Leaving our sons there is not an option.’ The kindergarten teacher told the New York Daily News: 'They are legally my children. They were raised orphans once and we’re not leaving them as orphans again.' The religious couple had been trying to conceive a biological child for two years and had always planned to adopt as many children as they could. The couple had been on mission trips in Africa, which is when they got the idea to adopt from Congo. A few months before they became Cannan and . Neema’s parents, the Carrolls found out that Alana was pregnant, according to the NY Daily News. Alone: Alana Carroll, 28, recently gave birth to the couple's first biological daughter, which her husband still has not met as he waits in Congo . Lost their parents: Congo is home to more than 800,000 children who've lost both parents, in many cases because of AIDS. Some seen here at this adoption home . According to UNICEF estimates, Congo - long plagued by poverty and conflict - is home to more than 800,000 children who've lost both parents, in many cases because of AIDS. Until the suspension was announced in September, Congo had been viewed by adoption advocates in the U.S. as a promising option at a time when the overall number of international adoptions has been plummeting. Congo accounted for the sixth highest number of adoptions by Americans in 2012 - 240 children, up from 41 in 2010 and 133 in 2011. There are varied explanations for the suspension - explanations which reflect how international adoption has become a highly divisive topic. The U.S. State Department, in its latest Congo advisory, says all applications for exit permits for adopted children are facing increased scrutiny because of concerns over suspected falsification of documents. Congolese authorities earlier attributed . the suspension to concerns that some children had been abused or . abandoned by their adoptive parents or have been ‘sold to homosexuals’. Reason for suspension: Congolese authorities suspended adoptions due to concerns that some children had been abused or abandoned by their adoptive parents or have been 'sold to homosexuals' ‘The government wants to get a handle on this matter, because there is a lot of criminality around it,’ Interior Minister Richard Muyej Mangez told The Associated Press last month. The State Department has said it is trying to get accurate information with the hope of enabling some of the families - such as the Carrolls - to take home children whose adoptions had been approved prior to the September 25 suspension. However, it has warned waiting parents that there could be significant delays. American diplomats in Kinshasa have met with the waiting families and with Congolese officials to discuss the suspension, but Alana Carroll said the families wished the U.S. Embassy staff would press harder to get the cases moving. ‘The ambassador said they didn't want to ruffle any feathers,’ Carroll said. The Carrolls and four other families have dubbed themselves the Stuck In Congo Five and created a Facebook page to draw attention to their plight. Alana and two of the other mothers also have been communicating through their blogs. One of them, Erin Wallace of Annapolis, Maryland, has been in Congo since October, awaiting exit papers that would enable her to bring  newly adopted daughter Lainey home to her husband and their two other children. The US State Department says it is trying to help some of the families to take home children whose adoptions had been approved prior to the September 25 suspension . She has urged readers of her blog to contact their congressional delegations on behalf of the five families. ‘We are desperate to return home with our children,’ she wrote. ‘We have been stuck for too long.’Katie Harshman, another of the bloggers, also has been in Kinshasa since October. Her husband, Eric, a groundskeeper with the University of Kentucky athletics department, joined her for the first seven weeks before returning to work. ‘There is no reason why we should still be here,’ Katie Harshman wrote in a recent post. ‘We have gotten caught in the middle of some kind of craziness.’ Successful adoption: Emily and Mike Mauntel of Atlanta, with their 2-year-old son, Moses, center, who they adopted from Congo. They also have a 4-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter . The Harshmans, Wallaces and Carrolls . have been working with Africa Adoption Services, a Louisville, Kentucky, . agency founded by Danielle Anderson, a former consular staffer at the . U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa. The spouses who are waiting in Kinshasa, along with their adopted children, are staying together in a guest house. Anderson . has advised the Americans to be cautious about venturing out with the . children, saying many Congolese people are suspicious about . international adoptions. Anderson said it's difficult to pinpoint why authorities there suspended adoptions. ‘It's . financial, it's political, it's because of severe homophobia,’ she . said. ‘But in the end, kids are getting stuck and families are not being . united.’ Perseverance: Emily Mauntel says she was in the Congo for almost four months trying to bring their son home, saying it was 'by far the most difficult time in my life' In the past two years, Africa Adoption Services has helped dozens of families complete adoptions from Congo, generally for a cost of about $27,000, excluding travel. Among the successful couples were Emily and Mike Mauntel of Atlanta, whose 2-year-old son, Moses, came home in October. The couple also have a 4-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter. ‘My heart is breaking for these five families stuck in the Congo and for the many more families waiting to bring their children home,’ Emily Mauntel wrote in an email. ‘I was in the Congo for almost four months trying to bring our son home and it was by far the most difficult time in my life.’ Among the U.S. agencies active in Congo is MLJ Adoptions, founded by Indianapolis attorney Michele Jackson, who has two sons adopted from the Congo. Even before the suspension, Jackson said, the international adoption process in Congo could be slow, with U.S. authorities often taking six months or more to verify that children were not part of any trafficking or baby-selling scheme. In at least recent three cases, Jackson said, children died of disease during the vetting process. Not orphans anymore: Alana Carroll says their two sons are so happy since their adoption that 'it¿s rocked their world' Thriving: Alana Carroll said one of her two new sons, Canaan, was introverted when her husband began caring for him, but is now full of life . 'Nightmare': Alana Carroll, pictured with her baby daughter, says the separation has taken a toll on them emotionally and hopes the ordeal will end soon . Alana Carroll said one of her two new sons, Canaan, was sickly and introverted when her husband began caring for him, and is now thriving. She told the NY Daily News that her husband has bonded with his two sons. 'He’s been teaching them English and playing with them,' Alana said. '...they’re all over him, laughing and calling us Mama and Papa.' 'You would never tell they’d been living at an orphanage,' Alana continued. 'It’s rocked their world.' But the long separation has taken an emotional toll. ‘It was like a dream come true and now it's like nightmare I can't wake up from,’ she said.","Justin Carroll, 30, won't leave Congo until he gets approval to bring his two newly-adopted sons to US .

"Experts have warned that governments are ill-prepared for a rise in 'injury and possible deaths' The world's first 'online murder' could occur by the end of this year, as cyber criminals exploit internet technology to target potential victims. Experts have warned that governments are ill-prepared to combat a rise in 'injury and possible deaths' caused by computer attacks on critical safety equipment. A Europol threat assessment  cited a report by US security firm IID that predicted the first murder via 'hacked internet-connected device' by the end of 2014. It said that police forensic techniques need to 'adapt and grow' to address the dangers posed by the  'Internet of Everything', The Independent reports. This refers to a new era of technological connectedness, in which everything from garage doors to hospital health systems will be linked and controlled through computer networks. 'There's already this huge quasi-underground market where you can buy and sell vulnerabilities that have been discovered,' said Rod Rasmussen, the president of IID. He added that while the first reported murder was yet to happen, 'death by internet' was already a reality from online extortion and blackmail that has led to suicide. If his firm's prediction of an online murder did not occur by the end of 2014, Mr Rasmussen said it was bound to happen within the next few years. 'The IoE [Internet of Everything] represents a whole new attack vector that we believe criminals will already be looking for ways to exploit,'  the Europol threat assessment stated. 'The IoE is inevitable. We must expect a rapidly growing number of devices to be rendered 'smart' and thence to become interconnected. 'Unfortunately, we feel that it is equally inevitable that many of these devices will leave vulnerabilities via which access to networks can be gained by criminals.' There have not yet been any proven cases of murder by tampering with devices, but hackers have highlighted numerous flaws in computer security systems. The former US vice-president Dick Cheney revealed last year that the wireless function had been disabled on his implanted defibrillator because of concerns of sabotage. Scroll down for video .

"A former high school football captain has revealed for the first time how being abused by a female teacher shattered his dreams of playing at college level and changed his future. Cameron Clarkson, 22, attended Catholic Cretin-Derham Hall in St Paul, Minnesota for four years where he eventually led the state-title winning Raiders football team. However Mr Clarkson's dreams of going on to play at college came crashing down when he was targeted at the age of 16 by substitute teacher and weight room supervisor Gail Gagne. Mr Clarkson is now suing the school for not doing more to protect him from the 25-year-old teacher. Gagne is also facing a lawsuit. Scroll down for video . Cameron Clarkson (pictured left this week) attended Catholic Cretin-Derham Hall in St Paul, Minnesota. When he was 16  he had a relationship with a 25-year-old substitute teacher which had a damaging effect on him . What began as a friendship between Gagne and the teenage boy over the summer of 2008 while he worked in the weights room, developed when the 25-year-old told the teen she had feelings for him. She is the daughter of former wrestler Greg Gagne and her grandfather is wrestling legend Verne Gagne. The sophomore and 25-year-old teacher began having sex at her parents' home and at a motel but the liaisons began to have a deeply unsettling effect on the schoolboy. In a new interview with Fox, he said: 'It got to the point where I didn't like sneaking around or feeling like I was doing something wrong, as much as I found her attractive. Getting food, rides home, feeling like the cool guy; it didn't feel right.' Former teacher Gail Gagne was registered as a sex offender after having sex with student Cameron Clarkson  in 2008 (right). She is now being sued by that student . The former football player said that rumors began to circulate at the esteemed school and left him with the reputation of a 'teacher f*****' and a pervert. Finally, a girl whom Clarkson was interested in went to the police about the teacher's affair with the student. Gagne lost her job at the prestigious school and Clarkson was targeted by bullies. His mother's car was vandalized, Fox reported, and the teacher's name bleached into his home's front yard. He said that after using marijuana to numb the pain, he headed to Howard University in DC so that he could get away from Minnesota. The student told Fox: 'I had to get away from this life, from this Cameron. I don't look like a victim of sexual abuse.' In 2011, at the age of 28, Gagne received a stayed jail sentence of one year and a $300 fine for having sex with the high school athlete. She served one year of probation. As part of a deal with prosecutors, Gagne waived her right to a jury trial after admitting sex with the student while she was working as a weight room supervisor. In exchange, the judge found her guilty of a reduced charge of fifth-degree criminal sexual conduct -- a gross misdemeanor -- and dropped a felony charge of third-degree criminal sexual conduct. Gagne's father Greg (pictured left) and her grandfather Verne (right) both made careers are professional wrestlers . Gagne registered as a sex offender in both California and Minnesota. She will never be allowed to work with minors again. Attorney Mike Freeman said at the time: 'A parent who sends their child to be taught and participate in activities to be coached ought not be worried about whether the coach is going to have sexual relations with that child. Period.' Mr Cameron is now suing his former teacher and school over the damaging effects the sexual relations had on his life. A settlement has not been reached with the school so a court date has been set for December 1. MailOnline was awaiting a statement from Cretin-Derham Hall on Tuesday.","Cameron Clarkson attended Catholic Cretin-Derham Hall in St Paul, Minnesota for four years and was captain of the football team .

"Five young children have been found living among piles of rubbish,  rat nests, cigarette butts and mouldy food in a house from hell. The children were discovered living with their parents when the owner of the rental property at Childers, north of Brisbane, kicked the family out last week. Viv Jocumsen was carrying out his first inspection of the McIlwraith Street property in eight months when he saw the children living amongst the squalor. Five young children were discovered living with their parents when the owner of the rental property at Childers, north of Brisbane, kicked the family out last week . The McIlwraith Street property was littered with rubbish, mouldy food and rat nests . 'One of the kids was trying to get around all of this mess,' Mr Jocumsen told the Northern Star. 'It breaks your heart seeing kids like that. They shouldn't have to live like that.' He expects the clean up bill for the house to exceed $30,000. The stench wafting from the house could be smelt from the street as piles of rubbish littered the house and mould plagued the walls. Remains of books strewn across the floor and in drawers had been used by rats to build their nests. The children's bathroom had leftover cereal in the sink and a mud-stained bath full of cigarette butts. The stench wafting from the house could be smelt from the street as piles of rubbish littered the house and mould plagued the walls . The laundry looked like it hadn't been touched in months with dried mud and cigarette butts filling the sink . The owner of the property, Viv Jocumsen, was carrying out his first inspection  in eight months . The children's bathroom had leftover cereal in the sink and a mud-stained bath full of cigarette butts . Mr Jocumsen, who has owned the property for eight years, said he notified the tenants he would be inspecting and they assured him there was nothing to worry about. 'They said it was immaculate but I told them I'd be there. When I arrived they were cleaning up but it was horrible,' he said. 'When I opened the front door it was black.' Child Safety Services were not contacted about the children being forced to live in such squalor. Viv Jocumsen said he was left heartbroken after seeing the children trying to manoeuvre around rubbish . Books and shoes were found strewn across the living area  and rats had formed nests throughout the house . Old bikes and electronics were found dumped underneath the family home . A child's slide was found next to an empty bed in a carpet-stained room . Neighbours say they reguarly put up with loud music, screaming and the foul stench. But Childers Police's Sergeant Geoff Fay said no one reported any incidents to police, which meant they had no way of knowing. It comes after an Adelaide mother faced court this week accused of endangering her four-year-old boy's life after he was found by police weighing just 8.3kg in a house strewn with rubbish. In a separate case, a father in Melbourne stands accused of letting his five-year-old boy died after cutting his foot on a can of Tuna at their home in 2012. He faced court this week after letting his two children live among rotting and spoilt food, mould, faeces and broken furniture.

"A woman who performed a sex act on a uniformed police officer has won £6,600 in damages from the Metropolitan Police today. The 37-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, asked PC James Formby, 34, to kiss her when he attended her home during a patrol in Bromley, south-east London. But the woman brought a damages case claiming she had been too drunk to consent when she later performed a sex act on the officer, who is not married. Former police constable James Formby lost his job after a woman performed a sex act on him after he was called to her house following reports she had been assaulted . The woman had been to a nightclub before her boyfriend allegedly attacked her in the street. Formby and another officer attended their home in the early hours 19 September, 2009, and he stayed at the scene when the boyfriend was arrested. The court heard this week how the woman 'asked Formby to kiss her' before 'removing his kit-belt and performing fellatio on him'. The woman later insisted she had no memory of what happened until she 'woke up' during the sex act. The court heard he later sent her a text message saying he wanted to 'do this again', but the woman reported the incident, leading to Formby facing a charge of misconduct in a public office and dismissal from the force. After the ensuing damages claim came . before the Central London County Court this week, Judge Edward Bailey today . awarded a total of £6,600 in compensation to the woman for the . psychological harm caused by the encounter. Awarding the woman more than £6,000 in damages today, a judge said Formby (pictured) 'should have put judgment before desire' The woman said she suffered from depression, the hair loss condition alopecia and underwent months of counselling after the incident. The judge also blasted the Met Police Commissioner for fighting the case. Giving his judgment today, Judge Bailey said: 'Both parties flirted but the claimant acted in a very sexualised manner. 'She was an active party in the initiation and commission of the oral sex. At no time did she pull away or ask the officer to desist. 'I conclude that there was consent to the sexual activity that took place. The woman brought a lawsuit against the Met Police after Formby (pictured) admitted misconduct in a public office and was dismissed from the force . But he added: 'The more extreme and outrageous the claimant's conduct was the more the officer should have appreciated that here was a woman whose psychological state was such that sexual contact would cause harm. 'It is certainly not commonplace for a woman to throw herself at a man she has just met. For a police officer on duty and in uniform every alarm bell in his head should have been ringing. 'But desire overcame judgement, it should have been the other way around. 'The officer didn't foresee the harm to the claimant but he did not stop to think that having sexual relations with this woman would cause her psychological damage.' He added: 'I express my disappointment that the Commissioner contested these proceedings. 'This was a publicly-funded case and there can be no doubt that each side has incurred costs well in excess of any sum that any judge could possibly award for the events in question. 'There is no obvious financial reason for contesting the case. 'The defendant (Met Police) has forced the claimant to come to court stand in the witness box and recall, recount and be questioned on an episode of her life that she would dearly like to forget. 'She has had to do this for no obvious good reason.' Formby, who gave evidence in the trial, maintained he had not taken advantage of the woman. 'She asked me to kiss her and I was a bit taken aback because I was a police officer on duty but on the other hand I'm a single guy,' he said. 'We ended up in the bedroom...She was on the bed, she had no bottom half on but was wearing a corset on the top half. 'We kissed, it was fairly frantic on her part and quite passionate. She was very clear physically about what she wanted to happen.' The Metropolitan Police was criticised by the judge for fighting the damages claim and forcing the woman to take the stand . The woman, sitting with her publicly-funded legal team, wept during the hearing. She told the court she was angry that Formby had not faced 'a more serious charge like rape'. But her changing account of the night was severely criticised by the Met Commissioner's lawyer. Jonathan Loades said the woman had presented 'a completely different version of events to that which was originally mentioned to the police'. He had urged the court to reject a medical report on the woman's drunkeness, after the expert had failed to recognise the woman was 'a chronic depressive for a long time'. Ruth Brander, for the woman, admitted her client had failed to rebuff the cop. 'It has never been the case the woman said 'no', but the issue is whether the witness had capacity to consent, given the state she was in. 'In terms of the misconduct offence I fully accept that what happened should not have happened. 'What I refuse to accept is that she was drunk or on drugs.' In 2010, Formby, from Maidstone, Kent, was handed a 20 week prison sentence suspended for two years after he admitted misconduct in a public office. He was also told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and pay £1,000 in prosecution and defence costs.","PC James Formby was called to the home of an alleged assault victim .

'She's . a 16-year-old girl from the suburbs who is trying to figure out who she . is and trying to forge an identity when she suddenly bestows great . power and learns the great responsibility that comes with it.' Writer G. Willow Wilson, who converted to Islam while studying at Boston University, and editor Sana Amanat, say Khan's story follows her as she learns to deal with superpowers, family expectations and adolescence. Amanat calls the series a 'desire to explore the Muslim-American diaspora from an authentic perspective' but is also a representation of what it means to be young and lost amid expectations from others. He said: 'I wanted Ms. Marvel to be true-to-life, something real people could relate to, particularly young women. Wilson added: 'High school was a very vivid time in my life, so I drew heavily on those experiences — impending adulthood, dealing with school, emotionally charged friendships that are such a huge part of being a teenager. The Khans: The new Ms Marvel  (second left) with her family including (left to right) brother Aamir, father Yusuf, mother Disha and friend Bruno . History: Marvel became a part of youth culture in the United States with comics like Captain America, which they created in 1941 to capture the patriotic spirit during the Second World War . 'It's for all the geek girls out there and everybody else who's ever looked at life from the fringe.' The idea came after a discussion with senior editor Stephen Wacker as he and Amanat, a Muslim-American, compared stories about their childhoods. From there it germinated into a 'character for all those little girls who are growing up now the way you are growing up'. Wilson was brought on board to write the series and the team quickly got approval from Marvel's creative committee to develop the idea. The team said that Khan's upbringing as a Muslim, is an element of the story, but not the critical foundation, either. Among its other characters, Marvel Comics also has . Dust, a young Afghan woman whose mutant ability to manipulate sand and . dust has been part of the popular X-Men books. DC Comics also introduced Nightrunner, a young Muslim hero of Algerian descent reared in Paris. While adapting to the diversity of their readers, the company are also aiming to maintain the attitudes that have been in their publications the since the creation of Spider-Man and the X-Men in the early 1960s. The first Ms Marvel made her debut in the 1960s and had her own self-titled series before becoming associated with the Avengers and the X-Men. The character has also been known as Binary, Warbird, and Captain Marvel at various points in the company's history. In 1977, writer Gerry Conway said, about the character: 'You might see a parallel between her quest for identity, and the modern woman's quest for raised consciousness, for self-liberation, for identity.'

"As a teenager, Emma Burton was taunted by bullies for  weighing 27 stone and having to wear a custom-made size 32 school uniform. Those same tormentors were stunned this year to see that she is now a size 10, having lost 16st 7lb – more than half her body weight – in just over 12 months. Miss Burton, now 22 and a striking 6ft mother of two, said it was ‘such an amazing feeling’ to shock the girls who made fun of her. Transformed: Emma Burton, 22, has lost 17 stone on the Cambridge weightloss plan . ‘I was verbally and physically bullied . for years, all the way through secondary school,’ she added. ‘The whole . school had a nickname for me. I was known as “The Burtonator” – because . everyone said I was built like the Terminator. ‘I was enormous. I had a specially . made man’s blazer, as my mum couldn’t buy one big enough for me. It was a . 50-inch chest, the same size as a bodybuilder. But since I’ve lost . weight, I’ve seen some of the girls who made my life hell and they . didn’t even recognise me. ‘It was the best feeling in the world to go over and introduce myself. Their jaws hit the floor when they realised who I was.’ Miss Burton, from Chatham in Kent, . said that although she enjoyed showing off her new size, her main . motivation for losing the weight was her children, Liam, three, and . Jennifer, 15 months. Then: Emma has struggled with her weight from a young age and was bullied at school because of her size . Now: The school bullies didn't recognise her now she's a slim size 10 . She was horrified when she saw pictures of herself cradling Liam after his birth, saying she wanted to ‘rip them up’. Any weight loss was put on hold when . she got pregnant again, but after having Jennifer she began the strict . Cambridge weight loss plan, which she read about and had cleared by her . doctor. The diet restricts slimmers to soups and shakes for a period, . before slowly reintroducing ‘real’ food in a measured way. Miss Burton, who is studying music at . the University of Kent, then transformed her diet, swapping dinners of . takeaway pizzas and crisps for chicken salads and grilled meat. No longer fits: As a size 32 school girl, she had to have a specially-made uniform . Whereas she used to drink ten cans of the soft drink Vimto a day, she now has eight glasses of water. By her daughter’s first birthday, she . weighed 10st 9lb and could fit into a size 10 party dress. Miss Burton, . who has separated from her children’s father, said: ‘I’ve been hugely . overweight my whole life and never in a million years did I think I’d be . able to go clothes shopping in a normal shop, let alone buy a size 10. 'Amazing feeling': The mother-of-two said she's delighted she can now be more active with her children . ‘I lost weight so quickly, and once it . started coming off it was easy to keep going. I used to be so . embarrassed to be seen by other people, I’d avoid going out. ‘I did all my shopping online. Now, I . love going shopping – especially for new clothes. I love being able to . take my baby out for long strolls in her pram and not be out of breath. ‘My family and friends even struggle to recognise me in a crowd sometimes.’ Miss Burton said she has now forgiven the bullies. ‘They couldn’t apologise enough for . how they treated me,’ she said. ‘But I lost the weight for me and my . children, not for them.’","Emma Burton, 22, from Kent, lost more than half her body weight .

"Pauline Chai told the High Court her vast shoe collection was proof the UK was her home . The Malaysian wife of a retail tycoon fighting to have her divorce carried out in British courts cited her vast collection of designer shoes as proof that she lives in the UK. Former beauty queen Pauline Chai told the High Court that keeping more than 1,000 pairs of shoes in her sprawling Hertfordshire estate meant the country mansion was her permanent home. The 67-year-old and her husband Khoo Kay Peng, who is also from Malaysia, are embroiled in a sensationally expensive divorce battle, with their respective lawyers already racking up bills of £2million. Dr Peng, who is the billionaire chairman of Laura Ashley, was not in court to hear his estranged wife's  claims.D . The 75-year-old is trying to have the divorce ruled in Malaysia, where Ms Chai would likely receive a lesser settlement than in the UK. 'I have got like 1,000 pairs of shoes,' Ms Chai told the court. 'All these were added up from 43 years. I accumulate them.' Dr Peng's lawyer presented photographs of her wardrobes in Kuala Lumpar, claiming she had just as much designer fashion elsewhere. But, Ms Chai, who was Miss Malaysia in 1969, said some of them were out of style and 'heavy'. She also revealed she had bought her estranged husband a padded toilet seat. 'He will sit on the toilet for four hours and read and do his work... And he got backache there, so I got the idea of the padded toilet seat.' The court heard how the couple, who have five children, settled at Rossway Park, near Berkhamsted, in 2009 after years of travelling, though Mr Peng does not consider it their home. They had lived there for four years when divorce proceedings were launched, with Ms Chai claiming she needed to get out of the 'abusive' marriage. She told Mr Justice Bodey: 'I just wanted to get away from an abusive, oppressive relationship which I could not take because of my age. 'When I was younger I could recover. Now it was too difficult to overcome it because of the violence and the fear he was putting on me.' She added: 'For those reasons. None of the finances bothered me. I knew he had enough to go for the rest of our lives so that never occurred to me. 'The reason I wanted freedom from him was because he was getting violent and I was very fearful.' Among the claims made in court yesterday were that her husband was investigated by a 'corruption agency' in Singapore 25 years ago. The claim was denied by Dr Khoo's lawyer. Dr Peng (left) was not in court but his lawyer said Ms Chai had just as many shoes in their homes abroad. The 67-year-old sported navy courts with a silver heel yesterday (right) The 67-year-old, pictured inside her plush home, claimed her vast shoe collection had to kept in several rooms . Ms Chai, pictured feeding pet alpacas on her Hertfordshire estate, also claimed her husband had been abusive . Beauty queen: Ms Chai was named Miss Malaysia in 1969 and has since lived in Australia, Canada and the UK . She told Mr Justice Bodey the family had been living in Perth, Australia, at the time and they uprooted and moved to Canada. Ms Chai did not give detail of the investigation - which she said took place in the late 1980s - but said two of her estranged husband's friends had been jailed. 'He was being investigated,' she said. 'There was a lot of panic. He was frightened. 'There was a lot of discussion about moving out of Perth to a country which has no extradition treaty with Singapore.' She added: 'A short while later the family just flew to Victoria (Canada) and we stayed there. 'I know he didn't leave Canada ... for a long time. He avoided Singapore for five years.' Dr Khoo was not in court and has yet to give evidence - but a lawyer representing him told the court: 'I suggest that is completely false. Dr Khoo was not personally investigated.' Ms Chai also said her family left Australia in the late 1980s after one of her children was 'beaten up' during an attack which had a 'racial undertone'. She said she had took the children out of a Perth boarding school, where they had been placed after the family moved from Malaysia. 'I believe there was a white policy in Australia in the seventies and they had just got rid of that policy,' she told the judge. 'But in fact it still remained and there was this racial undertone. 'Because of that one of the boys was just beaten up by about ten other boys after being called racial names. 'We decided to take the children out of the boarding school.' Battle: Despite consisting only of 'skirmishes' the battle at the High Court (pictured) has already cost £2m . Mr Justice Bodey is expected to rule at the end of the current round of hearings on where the case will be held. Ms Chai said she would be at a 'huge disadvantage' if she had to fight in Malaysia. Richard Todd QC, for Ms Chai, said she lived on a 'beautiful English estate', had a taste for English TV shows and valued what was 'quintessentially' English. He told Mr Justice Bodey that she was fulfilling a 'legitimate desire to be here'. At an earlier hearing Mr Justice Holman said Dr Khoo owned a 'chunk' of Laura Ashley and had properties in England and Malaysia worth more than £50million. He said that, on any 'feasible' view, Ms Chai would get tens of millions of pounds for the part she had played in their 42-year 'matrimonial partnership'. The hearing continues.","Pauline Chai told the court she owned more than 1,000 pairs of shoes .

"Special constable: Collette Carpenter, pictured here arriving at Bournemouth Coroner's Court, was using her mobile when she was involved in a fatal crash . A policewoman who repeatedly denied that she was talking on her mobile phone to her lesbian lover when she caused a fatal crash has escaped prosecution. Despite a police investigator saying that Collette Carpenter ‘very likely contributed’ to the accident, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was no evidence she had committed an offence because the phone was on her lap and set to loudspeaker. Miss Carpenter, 23, a special constable who has handed out at least six fixed penalty fines to motorists for using their mobile phones while driving, was talking to girlfriend Rosemary Bonny when she drove into the path of David Bartholomew’s motorcycle, an inquest heard. The father of two died hours later of horrific head injuries and multiple fractures. When interviewed by police, Miss Carpenter repeatedly lied and said she was not on her phone. She later said she briefly took a call before admitting she had been on the phone for the entire journey, but had had it on the loudspeaker in her lap. Experienced motorcyclist Mr Bartholomew, 54, of Bere Regis, Dorset, was riding his Honda CBF1000 east along the A31 at 7.20am on March 20 last year when Miss Carpenter – who was off-duty – pulled out of a side road in Ferndown to go west in her Peugeot 206. Witnesses said no one had been breaking the speed limit, but Miss Carpenter, of Colehill, Wimborne, said she had not seen Mr Bartholomew until the collision. Miss Carpenter, who has been with Dorset Police for three years, has completed a police driving course. PC John Hayward, Dorset Police’s accident investigator, told Bournemouth Coroner’s Court: ‘The use of her mobile phone can only have been a distraction and has very likely contributed to her not seeing the motorcyclist.' When asked about repeatedly changing her story, Miss Carpenter said: ‘In the time of the first interview, I just panicked and said what I said, which I know is not the truth. ‘I don’t know why I didn’t say about the phone. I was in shock, maybe I didn’t think it was relevant at the time. I was not distracted.’ Scene: Motorcyclist David Bartholomew collided with the side of Miss Carpenter's Peugeot 206, was catapulted into the road and died of horrific injuries hours later . Collision: The inquest heard Mr Bartholomew was riding a Honda CBF 1,000 bike east along the A31 at Ferndown, Dorset, at the time of the crash . However, coroner Mr Sheriff Payne . described her account of the incoming call as ‘total rubbish’ and said: . ‘She came up with misleading accounts of what happened.’ He recorded a . verdict of accidental death at the inquest on Monday. After the hearing, Lindsey Witcombe, . Mr Bartholomew’s partner of 12 years, said: ‘He wasn’t speeding – he . wasn’t doing anything. 'I was hoping for justice for him. The CPS seems to have appointed themselves both judge and jury. 'He was a highly intelligent and talented man. His life was his children.’ Motorcyclist: The family of David Bartholomew (pictured) have said they have been let down by the justice system . His daughter Charlotte, 25, added: ‘She is someone who should have known better.’ Mr Bartholomew was a manager at a metal fabrication firm and his other child is James, 25. A CPS spokeswoman said it did not . have enough evidence to charge Miss Carpenter with causing death by . careless or dangerous driving. She said: ‘There was no evidence to support that Miss Carpenter was holding her phone at the time of the collision.’ However, coroner Mr Sheriff Payne . described her account of the incoming call as ‘total rubbish’ and said: . ‘She came up with misleading accounts of what happened.’ He recorded a . verdict of accidental death at the inquest on Monday.

A CPS spokeswoman said it did not . have enough evidence to charge Miss Carpenter with causing death by . careless or dangerous driving. She said: ‘There was no evidence to support that Miss Carpenter was holding her phone at the time of the collision.’ It has been illegal to use a handheld mobile phone or similar device while driving since December 2003. This includes motorists stopped at traffic lights, stuck in traffic or even parked with the engine running. Anyone supervising a learner driver from the passenger seat is also banned from using a handheld phone. Offenders face a fine of £60 and three penalty points on their licences even if they were otherwise seen to have been driving safely. It is, however, legal to use hands-free devices such as headphones or a mobile phone ‘cradle’. Pushing buttons on a phone while it is in the cradle is not an offence if the driver is not holding the phone. Sat-navs and two-way ‘press to talk’ radios – which are often used by members of the emergency services and taxi drivers – are legal to use while driving. However, if police believe you are distracted and not in control of your vehicle you could be stopped and fined. You are allowed to use a handheld phone if you need to call the emergency numbers 999 or 112 and if it is unsafe to stop your car. Research has found that motorists using handheld mobile phones while driving are four times more likely to crash.","Collette Carpenter had phone on loud speaker in her lap at time of collision .

"Two conmen have been found guilty of persuading a woman to hand over £174,000 as part of a string of frauds against lonely hearts. A three-week trial at Winchester Crown Court heard how Suzanne Hardman was persuaded into handing over the cash after she was duped when responding to a false profile of an 'attractive middle-aged man' on the match.com website. Today, Monty Emu, 28, from Southsea in Hampshire and Adewunmi Nusi, from Berkshire were convicted of money laundering. Scroll down for video . Suzanne Hardman, who was conned out of £174,000 after she was duped on the dating website match.com by a false profile . The court heard how once the conmen developed a relationship with their victims, using the fake name James Richards, they then started to request cash. At first the women were asked for a £700 legal fee by a fake solicitor but then the sums requested rose to up to £100,000. One of the defendants, Adewunmu Nusi, who today was found guilty of money laundering following a three-week trial . The court was told that vulnerable women were conned out of £220,000 in total. The scam included a fictitious lawyer, Rod Thompson of ‘Quality Solicitors’, fake court documents and tax clearance certificates. During the trial, Ms Hardman, from Basingstoke, sobbed as she told the court how she was duped by a 'James Richards', who told her his mother had recently died. She said: 'He was very sociable, we got on, like a friendship. I learnt a bit about his background, I told him a bit about mine. She said that after they had been communicating for about 11 months, 'James Richards' told her that his dead father had a frozen account in India with £1.5million in it. He also told her that he intended to sell a number of properties owned by his father. On the first day of the trial, Emmanuel Oko, 29, Southsea, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and money laundering and Chukwuka Ugwu, 28, also of Southsea, admitted money laundering. Brooke Boston, 28, of Southsea, was cleared of charges of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering. A sixth person, Eberechi Ekpo, 26, of Southsea, was cleared of money laundering and fraud by false representation part-way through the trial. Simon Edwards, prosecuting, told jurors that messages of love and 'overblown affection' were sent to the victims through the match.com website before moving on to emails and text messages. Examples of the messages sent to multiple recipients included: 'You make me feel loved, you make me feel safe, most importantly you make me feel wanted. 'I knew our friendship would grow from the first day we spoke but neither one of us could imagine the love exploding, no thundering into our hearts.' Another read: 'Honey, seriously I love you because I have never been loved by anyone like you loved me. 'I feel like a complete man. The thought of your hands on my body, particularly when you hold me when I am sleeping. 'I love your generous kindness to me. I love your eye and lips, your sense of self-love. I want to be with you now.' This email reveals how the women were bombarded with messages where 'James' declared his love for them but also mentioned problems that would be solved by their cash . Following the case, prosecutors now say they will now be pursuing those convicted to strip them of their ill-gotten gains. Detective Constable Darrin Carey of Hampshire Constabulary said: 'This case centres around a web of lies constructed by a devious group of people with the sole intention of exploiting emotionally vulnerable women for financial gain. 'All members of this group played their part in these offences, which left nine women feeling used and embarrassed and has seen them lose significant amounts of money. 'The women were duped into thinking that they were talking to a man who was genuinely looking for love on the dating website match.com. Unfortunately for them, they were part of an elaborate scam. 'These verdicts should send out a clear message to people who think they can hide behind fake profiles and carry out these scams again and again, that they will be caught and dealt with by the courts. 'I would like to thank the women involved in this case for their courage in coming forward to report this and also for going through the distressing experience of giving evidence about a very personal subject.' The men were accused of using a fake profiles set up on match.com - mainly with the name James Richards - and then gradually swindled cash from vulnerable women . While Simon Edwards of the Crown Prosecution Service added: 'We hope that with these convictions the victims in this case who lost a considerable amount of money and, understandably, could have lost confidence in themselves, will be able to move on with their lives now that the offenders have been brought before the court. 'We will now apply to the court for the ill-gotten assets to be confiscated.' All four face sentencing on the week of October 13.","Conmen persuaded women to handover cash after duping them online .

"A Texas man is set to be released from prison just six days after he admitted to killing his two adopted stepsons in a fire in 1986. Ed Graf Jr pleaded guilty to murdering Joby, eight, and Jason Graf, nine, by locking them in a shed and burning in the city of Hewitt more than 25 years ago during a retrial in Waco last week. The 62-year-old took a plea deal that carries a 60-year sentence, but having been in custody for 28 years and because of the law at the time of the offense, he is already eligible for parole. To be released: Ed Graf, 62,  pleaded guilty to the murder of his two sons during his retrial in Waco, Texas, last week. However he will be released into a halfway house in Austin just six days after admitting to the crime . Victims: After more than 25 years, he finally admitted locking Joby, eight, (left) and Jason, nine, (right) in a shed and setting it on fire in Hewitt, Texas in 1986 . According to Texas Department of Corrections officials he will be released and sent to a halfway house in Austin. He will be required to wear a GPS monitoring tag 24 hours a day and will be subject to the highest level of parole supervision. After Graf's capital murder retrial in Waco last week, he was given credit for the time he served in prison and jail since April 1988. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said he was entitled to a new trial because the arson evidence used in his first trial has since been proved faulty. Initially witnesses said that the pattern of the burns meant the fire could only have been started deliberately with an accelerant such as gasoline. But new specialist evidence said it could have been an accident. Prosecutors at the new trial did not present any scientific evidence, but relied on witness testimony suggesting Graf had embezzled money from a bank and was acting suspiciously before and after his sons' deaths. Aftermath: This picture shows the scene of the fire that killed the two boys. Graf was granted a retrial because the arson evidence used initially was faulty . Case: Graf is led away from judge's chambers in Hewitt by police detective Frank Latham following his arrest for the murder of the youngsters in 1987 . Anger: Graf's ex-wife Claire Bradburn has long insisted he was guilty and believes he should spend the rest of his life in prison. However she admitted she found comfort in the fact he finally admitted to the murders . Claims of innocence: Ed Graf  (pictured inside the Alfred Hughes State Prison in Gatesville, Texas, last year) has always insisted he didn't kill the boys and put the fire down to their love of matches . Two months before the fire, according to court records, Graf had bought a $50,000 life insurance policy on each boy. Days after the deaths, Graf filed a claim for the insurance money. Graf's ex-wife, Clare Bradburn, had long insisted that she believed her ex-husband was guilty and still believes he should spend the rest of his life in jail. During the hearing last Tuesday, she said she had waited 28 years for Graf to finally plead guilty, the Waco Tribune-Herald reported. She also told the paper he was being released because of a 'huge flaw in our justice system.' However she said comfort in the fact that he finally admitted to killing her sons. Graf however repeatedly insisted he was innocent, suggesting he thought the boys may have set the fire by accident. Witnesses testified at both of his trial that Joby and Jason Graf liked to play with matches. The provision that mandates the release of a prisoner not under a life term once his credits for good behavior and time served equal the number of years of his term was changed in the 1990s. Orginal conviction: Graf is consoled by his counselor Don Youngblood after a jury sentenced him to life for murder in 1988 .","Ed Graf Jr, 62, pleaded guilty to killing Joby, 8, and Jason Graf, 9, in Hewitt .

"Britain joining military action against ISIL increases the risk of a terror attack on European soil, will be at greater risk of a terror attack, the EU's anti-terrorism chief has warned. Gilles de Kerchove claimed more than 3,000 Europeans have so far joined extremists fighting in Iraq and Syria. He said countries, including the UK, joining the international coalition against murderous ISIS militants must 'take some measures to protect their citizens' from the threat posed by returning fighters. Gilles de Kerchove claimed more than 3,000 Europeans have so far joined extremists fighting in Iraq and Syria.= . An IS militant fires a rocket propelled grenade  launcher during fighting near the Syrian Kurdish town of Ain al-Arab, known as Kobane by the Kurds . MPs are expected to vote in favour of Britain taking part in air strikes against ISIS bases in Iraq. Prime Minister David Cameron warned Britain cannot 'walk on by' in the face of the threat posed by 'psychopathic terrorists'. But Mr de Kerchove said the move raises the risk of retaliation from ISIS on European soil, and could even spur Al-Qaeda to launch an attack to show that it is 'still relevant'. He told the BBC that there had been 'steady growth' in the number of Europeans joining ISIS fighters, hitting an 'unprecedented' 3,000 in recent weeks. Asked if European countries joining military action raises the prospect of a terror attack on European soil, Mr Kerchove replied: 'I think we have to acknowledge that it will. 'That was clear with the French because three days ago ISIL issued a statement saying there would be retaliation against the coalition. 'A French man was kidnapped in Algeria and he has been beheaded. So in a way sadly they did what they announced.' 'So I think countries being part of this coalition will have to take some measures to protect their citizens and assess the risk. 'But this is not only the ISIL, you have Al-Qaeda, through its affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, and maybe the rise of ISIL may prompt Al-Qaeda to show that it is still relevant.' Prime Minister David Cameron warns ISIS has behaved with 'staggering brutality' as he opens the debate ahead of the vote in Parliament . 'That this House condemns the barbaric acts of ISIL against the peoples of Iraq including the Sunni, Shia, Kurds, Christians and Yazidi and the humanitarian crisis this is causing; . 'Recognises the clear threat ISIL poses to the territorial integrity of Iraq and the request from the Government of Iraq for military support from the international community and the specific request to the UK Government for such support; . 'Further recognises the threat ISIL poses to wider international security and the UK directly through its sponsorship of terrorist attacks and its murder of a British hostage; . 'Acknowledges the broad coalition contributing to military support of the Government of Iraq including countries throughout the Middle East; . 'Further acknowledges the request of the Government of Iraq for international support to defend itself against the threat ISIL poses to Iraq and its citizens and the clear legal basis that this provides for action in Iraq; . 'Notes that this motion does not endorse UK air strikes in Syria as part of this campaign and any proposal to do so would be subject to a separate vote in Parliament; . 'Accordingly supports Her Majesty's Government, working with allies, in supporting the Government of Iraq in protecting civilians and restoring its territorial integrity, including the use of UK air strikes to support Iraqi, including Kurdish, security forces' efforts against ISIL in Iraq; . 'Notes that Her Majesty's Government will not deploy UK troops in ground combat operations; . 'And offers its wholehearted support to the men and women of Her Majesty's armed forces.' The CIA has suggested there might be as many as 31,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq. Mr de Kerchove addedd: 'It is a steady growth. Probably the declaration of the establishment of the caliphate may have played a role.' Britain's decision to join military strikes follows the involvement of the US, France and several Arab nations. MPs have been recalled to Westminster today to vote on British involvement in air strikes against ISIS - also known as Islamic State or ISIL - in Iraq, at the request of the Iraqi government. Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'Of course, some will say that any action you take will further radicalise young people. ""I have to say this is a counsel of despair. The threat of radicalisation is already here. Young people have left our country to go and fight with these extremists. ""We must take action at home, but we must also have a comprehensive strategy to defeat these extremists abroad."" In the debate, former Defence Secretary Liam Fox added: 'You cannot join a Jihadi gap year and come back to the UK with impunity.' Six RAF Tornados have been stationed in Cyprus for the past six weeks and have been flying surveillance flights over northern Iraq. They could begin dropping bombs and missiles within hours of the Prime Minister giving orders after the Commons vote at 5pm. Opening the debate, Mr Cameron said: 'There is no more serious issue than asking our armed forces to put themselves in harm's way to protect our country.' He insisted British involvement in military action in Iraq was necessary and in the national interest, working with local partner countries to build an international coalition. He admitted the 2003 invasion of Iraq by Tony Blair's government 'hangs heavy' over the Commons, but warned today's situation is 'very different'. 'This is not 2003, we must not use past mistakes as an excuse for indifference or inaction,' the PM added. He said the UK has a 'duty' to act and could not leave responsibility for keeping the British people safe to other countries. 'Is there a threat to the British people? The answer is yes,' he said. 'ISIL has already murdered one British hostage and has threatened to murder two more.' Mr Cameron added: 'ISIL is a terrorist organisation unlike those we have dealt with before. 'The brutality is staggering - beheadings, crucifixions, gauging out of eyes, use of rape as a weapon. All those things belong to the dark ages.'","Gilles de Kerchove warns of 'steady growth' in Europeans joining ISIS .

"Smartwatches and wearables such as Google Glass are designed to make life easier - but these cutting-edge gadgets require considerable investment. But now there’s a kit with a tiny screen that promises to turn everyday spectacles into smart glasses, and can be used to make a games console, smartwatch, remote control and more – from just $20 (£13). The makers of TinyScreen claim the screen can also be incorporated into jewellery to display ever-changing visuals. Scroll down for video . A kit with a tiny screen promises to turn every day spectacles into smart glasses (pictured left) and can be used to make a games console, smartwatch, (right) remote control and more – from just $20 (£13). What it is? Tinyscreen is a small customisable display . Uses: depending on the kit purchased, the screen can form part of a smartwatch, basic version of Google Glass, video player or necklace. Apps: It comes with a number of pre-loaded apps including a smartwatch app, video player and games, such as a clone version of Flappy Bird. Customisable: The watch can be configured with basic code to use different watch faces and a Bluetooth connection to 'talk' to Android or iOS devices. Notifications: Customisable notifications can inlcude incoming calls, tweets and texts, plus appointments. Cost: Between $20 (£13) and $460 (£288) depending on the kit. Delivery date: Kits are due to be shipped in January. They include: the screen itself ($20 or £13) basic kit ($55 or £34) video player kit ($65 or £41) video game kit ($75 or £47) smart watch kit ($90 or £56) and deluxe kit ($120 or £75). More complex kits to build robots, sensors and all of the ideas are available. Ohio-based company, Akron, is raising funds on Kickstarter to mass produce its device, which costs $20 (£13) for the screen alone, plus $90 (£56) for the smartwatch kit. The idea is proving popular, with more than $41,000 (£25,660) pledged so far. And with 22 days to go, the campaign has already exceeded the $15,000 (£8,388) goal set by the company. TinyScreen is a small customisable 16-bit colour, 96x64 pixel OLED display, that is not flexible. It has been designed to let people play games, get notifications from their phone, and display useful information on their wrist in the form of a smartwatch, for example. Once assembled, users will be able to fix the TinyScreen to a pair of spectacles to make a basic version of Google Glass. They will then be able to watch videos and view phone notifications easily. The firm claims that a number of pre-programmed apps will work right out of the box. These include a smartwatch app, video player app and a video game app - which the developers promise require no programming skills. With a little know-how, they explain that the smartwatch can be configured to use several different watch faces, as well as a Bluetooth connection to communicate with an iPhone or Android phone. An open source app will additionally allow people to set up the type of notifications that they can receive and display on the watch, like incoming phone calls, texts, tweets and appointments.

The Tesla and Space X founder has previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons . He said: ‘I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence. ‘I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish. ‘With artificial intelligence we’re summoning the demon. You know those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he’s sure he can control the demon? Doesn’t work out.’ In August, he warned that AI could to do more harm than nuclear weapons. Tweeting a recommendation for a book by Nick Bostrom called Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies that looks at a robot uprising, he wrote: ‘We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes.’ Elon Musk is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers. But in August, the Tesla founder warned that AI could to do more harm than nuclear weapons (Tweet pictured) The book asks questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers and argues that humans are living in a computer simulation and not the ‘real’ world. In a later tweet, Musk wrote: ‘Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable.’ Mr Musk has previously claimed that a horrific ‘Terminator-like’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence. The 42-year-old is so worried, he is investing in AI companies, not to make money, but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand. In March, Mr Musk made an investment San Francisco-based AI group Vicarious, along with Mark Zuckerberg and actor Ashton Kutcher.

Demis Hassabis, 37, founded DeepMind two years ago . with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans. Vicarious’ ultimate aim is to build a ‘computer that thinks like a person…except it doesn’t have to eat or sleep’, according to the company's co-founder Scott Phoenix. In an interview with CNBC, Musk said: ‘I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there.’ ‘There have been movies about this, you know, like Terminator,’ Musk continued. ‘There are some scary outcomes. And we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad.’ Vicarious is currently attempting to build a program that mimics the brain’s neocortex. The neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals. It is around three millimetres thick and has six layers, each involved with various functions. These include sensory perception, spatial reasoning, conscious thought, and language in humans. According to the company’s website: ‘Vicarious is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain. ‘Our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans. ‘Powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the Recursive Cortical Network.’ In October 2013, the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ‘reliably’ solves modern Captchas - the world’s most widely used test of a machine’s ability to act human.

'Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history,' he said writing in the Independent. 'Unfortunately, it might also be the last' Captchas are used when filling in forms, for example, to make sure it’s not being completed by a bot. This prevents people programming computers to buy a bulk load of gig tickets, for example. As well as Vicarious, Mr Musk was early investor in AI firm DeepMind, which was earlier this year acquired by Google for £400m ($678m).

Earlier this year, the renowned physicist discusses Johnny Depp's latest film Transcendence, which delves into a world where computers can surpass the abilities of humans. Professor Hawking said dismissing the film as science fiction could be the ‘worst mistake in history’.","Space X and Tesla founder has previously warned that technology could potentially be more harmful than nuclear weapons .

"Thousands of patients, including those suffering from terminal breast and bowel cancer, could be denied life-extending medicines under plans to halt the ballooning cost of David Cameron’s flagship Cancer Drugs Fund. The body – set up specifically to fund expensive cancer treatments – has offered a lifeline to more than 50,000 patients since it was created in 2010. However, its £200 million budget was overspent by £30 million last year – leading to health bosses being forced to raid other parts of their funds. Now NHS England has announced it is to hold a month-long consultation to consider whether some of the most expensive drugs should be withheld from new patients to save money. NHS England has announced it is to hold a month-long consultation to consider whether some of the Cancer Drugs Fund's most expensive drugs should be withheld from new patients to save money . Among the drugs that could be rationed are Avastin, made by Swiss giant Roche, which fights terminal bowel, breast, ovarian, cervical, and brain cancer, and costs almost a quarter of the Cancer Drugs Fund budget. Bowel cancer drug Erbitux, breast cancer drugs Perjeta and Afinitor, and the pancreatic cancer drug Abraxane thought to be earmarked for the cuts. Under the current scheme, patients in England can apply to access drugs deemed too costly under normal NHS rules if their doctor says their health will benefit. Cost is not considered. But health bosses say some of the 41 Fund-approved drugs must be cut to ensure the body stays within budget, which this year was raised to £280 million, and make room for better new medicines. Dr Caitlin Palframan, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: 'We need the pharmaceutical industry to step forward and offer better prices. The question is, if they don’t, what will happen to these patients?’ Drugs that fail to prolong patients’ lives long enough, or give them a good enough quality of life, will be removed, as will those that cost too much, even if they are highly effective. Patients already on these drugs will be allowed to continue taking them, but access for new applicants will be stopped. The cuts could start as soon as next year, according to sources. Last night, cancer charities warned that highly effective drugs already turned down by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on cost grounds, could also be removed from the Fund’s list. Patients already on these drugs will be allowed to continue taking them, but access for new applicants will be stopped . Dr Caitlin Palframan, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘The Fund is meant to be a safety net for expensive drugs. We know it has overspent, so it is right they’re reviewing how it works. However, we are concerned some drugs might come off. ‘We need the pharmaceutical industry to step forward and offer better prices. The question is, if they don’t, what will happen to these patients?’ Mark Flanagan, of Beating Bowel Cancer, added: ‘We risk going back to the bad old days where if NICE says “No” to a drug, there’s no other option.’ However, some said the decision was overdue. Karol Sikora, founder of Cancer Partners UK, said: ‘The problem is this is a very emotional and politically sensitive area. But the rationalisation has to be done: the NHS is not a bottomless pit of money. 'Cancer charities will say everybody has to have everything. But what are you going to cut? Hearing aids for the elderly? Children’s mental health services?’ Experts have also queried whether the Fund has gone over budget at all. In the first three years, only £330 million of the £450 million earmarked was actually spent, with £120 million going back into the general NHS pot. Professor Peter Clark, of the Cancer Drugs Fund, said: ‘To ensure patients continue to have access to the best innovative treatments, we must re-evaluate some of the drugs on the list. This is the right thing to do for patients.’","Cancer Drugs Fund was set up in 2010 to fund expensive treatments .

"Not everyone agrees with the phrase - 'the more the merrier', as organisers have cancelled a property development's first launch party because too many people confirmed attendance. Mirvac and UrbanGrowth, the property development's organisers, cancelled Tuesday's cocktail event for the launch of Green Square located in the inner-south of Sydney. After receiving 'overwhelming success' and 'overwhelming interest', the organisers sent  an email to guest just one week before the party, The Sydney Morning Herald reports. Green Square is set to contain approximately 2000 apartments, 14,000-square-metres of retail space and around 50,000-square-metres of office space . The card invitation to Green Square's cocktail party event. Mirvac and UrbanGrowth, the property development organisers, cancelled the first launch of Green Square in the inner-south of Sydney . 'A surprisingly high volume of acceptances to the event from stakeholders, supporters and friends of Green Square has seen guest numbers exceed both our expectations and the capacity of the venue,' the email read. 'We plan to host the event in early 2015 to allow us to accommodate the large number of guests interested in experiencing all that Green Square has to offer.' Green Square is set to contain approximately 2000 apartments, 14,000-square-metres of retail space and around 50,000-square-metres of office space. The development hopes to see hundreds of new families relocating to the Green Square town centre, with already having an overwhelming level of interest for one, two and three bedroom apartments, The Australian reports. 'Green Square has been conceived from a very different urban design perspective,' said Brett Draffen, Mirvac chief investment officer. The development hopes to see hundreds of new families relocating to the Green Square town centre, with already having an overwhelming level of interest for one, two and three bedroom apartments . 'All the fundamentals that contribute to a healthy and sustainable lifestyle have been considered. Residents have ready access to Green Square Train Station. 'Sydney will need to accommodate another 1.7 million people by 2030 and to do so, housing density, in locations close to infrastructure will need to increase.' But it seems like both Mirvac Group and UrbanGrowth are not quite ready for the overwhelming response from interested parties. After spending around $45,000 for the event, John Carfi, executive of residential apartment at Mirvac Group justified his reason to postbone event. 'In the scheme of the sales and marketing process for this development, [the cost is] not significant,' he said. Organisers estimated that only 500 people would join the launch party at Eveleigh's Australia Technology Park. Neither UrbanGrowth or Mirvac has mentioned how many people RSVP-ed yes to the event but according to Mr Carfi, organisers were not prepared to cater to such a large crowd. 'I've lost count, to be honest. We're certainly well over what we anticipated,' said Mr Carfi. He said he did not want to 'underwhelm people' and give off a bad first impression. 'That was probably the bigger risk for us,'he said.

"This Michigan home may look like a normal house from the outside - but hidden behind its walls is an organ more complex than many found inside churches around the world. And while the one-bedroom property is on the market for $129,000, the rare instrument would take music-lovers five years to assemble to the tune of $1 million dollars, experts say. The 85-year-old organ was bought in 2002 from a Muskegon church by homeowner Bill Tufts, who died this year at 72. He was long obsessed with organs - even though he never knew how to play. The instrument, which has three sets of keyboards and pedals, is next to the kitchen table and when it is played, a giant blower can be heard in the basement, WZZM reported. Music to your ears: This modest Grand Rapids, Michigan house is home to an organ with around 2,300 pipes . Complex: The home is on the market for $129,000 - even though the organ costs around $1 million . Hidden: A room at the back of the house is filled with pipes, with the tallest standing at 17 feet . But while the keys are the only part of the instrument on show, the organ's extensive web of pipes take up a third of the entire house. Pipes of all sizes are hidden in a room at the back of the house. The longest pipe is 17 feet and, in total, there are around 2,300 pipes - each providing a different music note. Tufts, who adored organ music but worked as a car mechanic, had wanted a pipe in his home ever since he was a boy - but he could only ever look at it. 'He couldn't play it, but he wanted an organ in his house so he had it put in,' realtor Mark Douglas told WZZM. Web: A giant blower is in the basement, while pipes fill up so many other rooms that there is just one bedroom and one-and-a-half bathrooms inside the house. The organ took the previous owner years to build . Work of art: Each of the pipes provides a different note - and the house is well insulated to prevent noise . Extravagant: It would cost $100,000 to re-install the pipes elsewhere - and $1 million to completely replicate . Grand: The organ's previous owner, who passed away this year aged 72, could not even play the instrument . He found the organ, which dates from the 1990s, in need of serious repair in Muskegon and installed it with the help of friends and Haan Pipe Organ, the Huffington Post reported. Tufts, who had no surviving family members, bequeathed the home to Don Haan, the owner of Haan Pipe Organ, and his partner, Guy Vander Wagen. Because of the Kimball organ, the house has just one upstairs bedroom and one-and-a-half baths, but the garage where Tufts worked as a handyman is heated and air-conditioned. Haan said re-installation would cost about $100,000, and he estimated that duplicating the entire 'irreplaceable treasure' would likely cost close to $1 million. Despite its size, insulation inside the house means the neighbors won't complain about the noise. Unassuming: From the outside it is impossible to tell that the rare instrument fills up rooms inside . Much-needed space: As well as the house, the property has a garage that is heated and air-conditioned . It's 'probably not any more [noise] than your average church would leak sound,' Douglas said. He said he's received calls from across the country, and some potential buyers want to salvage the organ and re-sell the home. Haan said they hope to find a buyer who possesses the same passion and dedication to the merger of the home and instrument as his late friend. 'We really would like somebody to buy it who likes the organ and appreciates it for what it is,' he said.","The owner of the home, which is in Grand Rapids, Michigan, passed away this year, aged 72 .

"The New York subway system is notorious for its out-of-the box passengers. From train performers to the occasional drunkard yelling profanities, you never know what you're going to see. But in this case, what drew attention was what passengers didn't see: clothing. That's right. On Thursday night, a drunk man was caught snoozing on the E train naked, wearing only socks and a pair of sneakers, the New York Post reports. Scroll down for video . Snoozing: On Thursday night, a drunk man was caught snoozing on the E train naked, wearing only socks and a pair of sneakers . The post reports that in between naps, the man took swigs from a jug of Jack Daniel's as he let it all hang out on the southbound train. Peter Davis, an editor at the Daily Front Row fashion magazine, had thought he'd seen it all but couldn't help but snap a photo of the outrageous scene. 'He was just really drunk. He would swig it and then nod out,' Davis told the Post. 'He must’ve taken four swigs in four stops.' Naps: In between naps, the man took swigs from a jug of Jack Daniel's as he let it all hang out on the southbound train . The post reports that the naked man rode the train for at least six stops with as many as 30 passengers on the train. Davis said that the man looked oblivious and didn't seem to care when he snapped the photo around 8pm. He said that some of the other passengers seemed afraid of the man who didn't smell and was sporting a fresh hair cut. 'The one thing people did was move away from him like he was dangerous,' Davis said. 'There were a lot of blasé New Yorkers that looked — and then looked back at their iPhone as if he wasn't even there.' Afraid: Peter Davis, a train passenger, snapped a photo of the man and said that the other passengers seemed afraid of him . Davis posted the photo to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram where comments ranged from jokes about the man to concern. In his Facebook post featuring the photo, Davis wrote 'Just spotted on the E Train. After a lifetime in NYC I thought I had seen everything...' Some made light of the situation with comments like 'They turned on the heat on the subways today. I'm just sayin'... It was hot down there,' and 'He didn't want to take off his shoes and socks for fear of getting athlete's foot.' Social Media: Davis posted the photo to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram where comments ranged from jokes about the man to concern . Some Twitter users were more concerned, tweeting things like 'This is so incredibly SAD. His bag of life belongings must be next to him. He's probably mentally ill and tragically lonely.' The incident seemed to be very similar to a scene from an episode of the popular TV show 'Seinfeld.' In a season three episode titled 'The Subway' Jerry has a strange train encounter of his own when he awakes from a catnap to find a naked man sitting directly across from his reading a newspaper. Perhaps the drunk, naked, E train passenger is a fan. MTA officials were not available for comment.","A drunk man rode the E train Thursday for at least six stops taking naps and drinking whiskey .

"Queensland scientists have made a breakthrough in their fight against chlamydia and the damage the infection is inflicting on the koala population. Scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast have spent five years working on the vaccine for the sexually transmitted infection which has left koalas on the verge of extinction. The infection, which is rapidly being transmitted during birth and physical contact, is one of the main reasons the iconic Australian marsupials are now listed as endangered species. But researchers have successfully trialled the vaccine after observing wild koalas in the Moreton Bay region, north of Brisbane. Scroll down for video . The Australian iconic marsupials are nearing extinction because of the deadly disease but scientists have found a new vaccine to combat chlamydia . Chlamydia, also known as 'wet bottom' or 'dirty tail', causes blindness and infertility in koalas. Sixty koalas were captured, tagged and monitored, while 30 animals receiving the vaccine and 30 remaining unvaccinated as a control group. USC microbiologist Professor Peter Timms told Daily Mail Australia that they had successfully immunised the koalas and the results were promising. 'What we wanted to do was capture koalas from the wild and find out two things,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast have spent five years working on vaccine for chlamydia . A koala being caught by a handler to be vaccinated . 'The first thing was to cure the ones already infected and see if the vaccine has decreased the disease. 'And secondly, we wanted to help prevent healthy koalas from getting infected in the future.’ Mr Timms said the vaccine decreased chlamydia infection levels in the koalas who received the dose. 'This large trial has confirmed that the vaccine is safe to give to not only captive koalas, but also koalas in the wild,' he said. 'We found a positive response and we know the vaccination is getting better and we're going the right direction as well.' USC microbiologist Professor Peter Timms (right) told Daily Mail Australia that the research team has successfully immunised the koalas and the results were promising . Mr Timms said the vaccine decreased chlamydia infection levels in the koalas who received the dose . Scientists have found a breakthrough for koalas to combat chlamydia and save them from being extinct . The million dollar project allowed the research team to put a 'radio collar' on each vaccinated koala to be able to keep track before releasing them back into the sanctuary. 'The radio collars are worth $1000 each and they help us monitor and give samples of their health,' he said. 'They are really expensive and the project was heavily funded to make it all possible. The Australian iconic marsupials are currently listed as an endangered species in Australia . The trial will extend for at least another year but Mr Timms said the team wants to follow the animals for two more years. 'We hope to specifically show a positive effect of the vaccine on disease, not just infection, as well as female reproductive rates,' he said.

'Many . of the scenes depicted at Busch Gardens' Howl-O-Scream are graphic in . nature, but they are fictional and are not intended to provide . commentary on current world events,' spokesman . Travis Claytor wrote. 'The props in this year's event were designed and . purchased several months ago.' Complaints . cropped up recently in Williamsburg when the Virginia Gazette newspaper . ran a photo of five severed head props that were part of the . attraction. The props were part of the Cut Throat Cove attraction, which showed a pirate-themed haunted house with body parts and heads. 'Within this macabre market, the pirates . have been slaughtered and mutiny is afoot,' the description on the . website reads. 'The way out lies with the buried treasure and the . blood-curdling screams you hear just might be your own.' Decorations like this one at Busch Gardens has drawn criticism from some parkgoers who say it's too gruesome in light of the latest ISIS beheadings . The removed props were a part of the park's yearly Howl-O-Scream attraction . The attraction rubbed some parkgoers the wrong way. 'That’s not … consistent with the Halloween spirit at all,' parkgoe rHartley Bond  told WAVY. 'I think it was good that they pulled it. It was out of order and insensitive to public sentiment. So, I’m glad they responded.' Some, like patron Norman England, disagreed. 'It’s Halloween. I would not associate one with the other, you know?' he told WAVY. 'That’s how I feel about it. People go there for the scariness, and what’s happening in the Far East is entirely different.' The Virginia Gazette reported that it ran a front page photo of the severed head props Saturday, three hours after media outlets began reporting that the terrorist group Islamic State had posted a new video claiming to have beheaded Haines, a British aid worker. Gazette Editor Rusty Carter defended running the photos, according to a story on the paper's website. 'The photo was taken last week as part of an assignment to preview a current exhibit,' he said. 'The figures are cartoonish in design, and do not look realistic. It is the job of our reporters and photographers to report and photograph the news, not censor it.' Busch Gardens Williamsburg's Halloween-themed attraction opened in mid-September. The Tampa park's attraction opens Sept. 26.","Busch Gardens in Virginia and Tampa will no longer show headless props this Halloween .

"It’s been almost a year since Google released its Nexus 5, and rumours about the next model have been ramping up in recent weeks. The latest reports claim the device, dubbed the Nexus 6, has a 5.9-inch screen and will run Android L - the firm’s next-generation operating system. This would put the device in direct competition with Apple’s phablet 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus. The latest reports claim the device, dubbed Nexus 6, has a 5.9-inch screen and will run Android L – the firm’s next-generation operating system. Inside the device is rumoured to be a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor, which is also found in the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. This should improve battery life . It would also put it on par with Samsung's flagship Galaxy Note 4, which has a 5.7-inch display. Other rumoured specifications include a 2MP front-facing camera, and camera on the rear that could range between 8MP and 13MP. Based on last year’s Nexus 5, prices for the Nexus 6 are rumoured to be around the £300 ($400) mark. At this price, it would make the Nexus 6 more than half the price of the cheapest, SIM-only iPhone 6 Plus, which retails from £619 and from $299 a month on a two-year contract in the US. By comparison, the Samsung Note 4 costs £629 in the UK, and $825.99 in the US. And the Nexus 6 may go on sale as early as 1 November, which would follow suit with the release schedule of its predecessor and release it in time for Christmas.

"A country pub where Prince William once enjoyed romantic evenings with his then-girlfriend Kate Middleton has received a zero rating for food hygiene. The Potting Shed, in Crudwell, Wiltshire, was investigated after a complaint, with the local council telling the business that there are 'clearly problems with managing food safety'. In the run-up to the announcement their engagement in November 2010, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were regularly spotted emerging arm-in-arm from the pub - and, on one occasion, enjoying a passionate embrace. Low marks: The Potting Shed Pub in Crudwell was given a zero rating for food hygiene . Favourite spot: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were once regulars at the Wiltshire drinking spot . Improving: Landlord Julian Muggridge says the pub has now overhauled its food preparation . Romantic: The couple were spotted enjoying several meals in the pub ahead of their 2010 engagement . But in the four years since the royal engagement, standards at the pub appear to have dropped - so much so it became the only business in north Wiltshire to get a zero rating this year. Food hygiene, which is given a mark out of five, got zero - the worst rating - which means that drastic improvements are required. Pub co-owner Julian Muggridge said: 'On the August bank holiday, on which we were holding our annual Shed Fest festival, we were inspected by the Wiltshire food hygiene team. 'We were carrying more stock than is normal given the business levels expected over the weekend, we were also let down by a member of the team who was not following our food storage guidelines. 'This member of the team has since been removed from his post. 'We would like to assure the general public that all recommendations given have been adopted and all paperwork that was missing was instantly put in place and is up to date. 'We have recently been re-checked by the Wiltshire food hygiene team who have assured us that upon a re-scoring we will be reinstated to a top score, as we have been since we opened. 'We do sincerely apologise to our customers for this unintended oversight.' A spokesman for Wiltshire Council said it inspected the pub following a complaint and there were 'clearly problems with managing food safety'. He added: 'Our food safety officers gave instruction on what needed to be done to address these issues and since revisiting we can confirm these have been resolved and the owner has said he will apply for a review of his previous food hygiene rating score.' When deciding on a rating council officers check how hygienically food is handled, the condition of the building and how the business manages its processes to make sure food is kept safely. To get a zero, a business must perform poorly in all three of these categories.","The Potting Shed in the village of Crudwell was the scene of several dates .

"Abigail Harris, 12, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was on a family holiday when the driver mounted a pavement and ploughed into her in Gran Canaria . The family of a 12-year-old British schoolgirl who was killed in a hit-and-run crash on holiday in the Canary Islands have no idea whether the motorist was ever prosecuted. Abigail Harris was celebrating her sister Jessica's 14th birthday with her family when the driver of a Ford Escort allegedly fell asleep at the wheel, mounted a pavement and ploughed into her in the resort of Puerto Rico in Gran Canaria. The youngster, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, suffered multiple fatal injuries and died at the scene outside a shopping centre. Her stepbrother suffered a fractured collar bone and cuts to his feet which required 49 stitches. However, Abigail's family have no idea whether the motorist has ever been prosecuted over the incident in April 2010, because Spanish authorities are refusing to hand over the information until they get a lawyer. At an inquest in Bradford into the schoolgirl's death this week, the coroner ruled that she died as a result of unlawful killing. The inquest heard how the incident occurred as Abigail, Jessica, their mother Nicola and her partner Keith Thackray and his son Thomas, 12, were nearing the end of their holiday. In a statement, Mr Thackray said: 'We had been out horse riding and for a meal. On the way back to the apartment we needed some money. I parked the car next to a cash machine, off the side of the road. 'All five of us were walking toward the cash machine. As the group set out on foot Abigail was in the front nearest the road walking with Thomas. 'Jessica, Nicola and myself were directly behind. Then a car mounted the pavement nearly hitting Nicola, Jessica and myself. The car struck Abigail and Thomas and then veered back into the carriage way and sped off without stopping. 'After the impact I ran to Thomas and Nicola ran to Abigail. When I reached Thomas he was unconscious but breathing. He [had] careered through the air and landed against a parking bollard but after a minute or so he opened his eyes and was conscious. 'Abigail had been thrown into the air but not as far as Thomas. When I checked her she was breathing but unconscious and badly injured.' The inquest heard how moments after the collision, the driver of the blue Escort drove away - despite having a badly cracked windscreen due to the force of the impact. The car only returned to the scene when the occupants were followed and stopped by a taxi driver. Mr Thackray said that once the car returned to the scene, a female got out and, in broken English, said 'I am so sorry, I am so sorry.' An inquest in Bradford into the schoolgirl's death ruled she was killed unlawfully in Gran Canaria in April 2010 . Abigail was killed during a holiday with her family to celebrate her sister's birthday in Puerto Rico, Gran Canaria . When police arrived Mr Thackray was asked to go back to his apartment to show officers their passports but he returned to his family to be told Abigail had passed away. Mr Thackray said: 'In my view she was unlawfully killed by a driver who mounted the pavement in a ridiculous fashion and who had the audacity to drive off.' Police later charged Jaime Noguera and his daughter Ingrid - who had no driving licence - with homicide due to negligence after conflicting reports over which one of them was driving the vehicle. Both Noguera and his daughter were breathalysed but tests showed they had no alcohol in their systems. In statement from Spanish Police, the investigating officer said there were discrepancies in the statements of eyewitnesses as to who was driving the Escort. One witness saw a woman driving the vehicle - yet Noguera claimed he was driving the entire time. He claimed he did not realise he had hit anyone despite a large crack on the front windscreen which would have obscured his vision. Spanish police said: 'Two eyewitnesses said they could see that the person driving the vehicle was female. Two eyewitnesses said the vehicle was driving quite quickly at the moment of the accident. Abigail's family do not know if those charged over the crash which killed her have ever been prosecuted because Spanish authorities won't hand over the information until the family hire a lawyer . 'Two eyewitnesses also said that the person driving the vehicle returning to the scene was a male. All witnesses said the vehicle did not stop.' A statement from Noguera said he had been driving at 40 kilometres per hour and added: 'He is sorry for what happened to the family of the victims. 'He was driving with his daughter who was not driving and has never driven. He was looking for a pedestrian crossing. 'He thought he was distracted or fell asleep. He mounted the pavement and felt a hit on the front passenger side. 'He had not seen what he had hit. He carried on driving. His daughter told him she thought he had hit someone and that he should stop.' His daughter insisted she wasn't driving as she does not have a driving licence. She said the pair were on their way home from the doctors and she hadn't realised her father was feeling unwell. Her statement read: 'After hearing a loud sound and seeing someone on top of the car she made her father turn back. In turning around they saw the taxi driver. They returned to the scene and then they saw what was there.' Coroner Oliver Longstaff recorded a verdict of unlawful killing at the inquest and said: 'This conclusion can come as no surprise to her family and no comfort to her family. 'You have lived with these difficult events for four and a half years now. 'The Spanish justice system will not reveal the outcome to the deceased's next of kin. 'The only way to find out is through the intervention of lawyers. It is up to the family whether to obtain it. When this is not done the Spanish will not budge hence the delay that has occurred.' Mr Longstaff also offered his condolences to the family and told them 'nothing said can do anything to bring her back'. He added: 'If this is any consolation, I am entirely satisfied that Abigail was utterly unaware of what was going on. How as a family you move on from this I don't know. I never hope to find out. 'I offer you my personal sympathy for these catastrophic events that you have had to live with. It may be in time it may be easier to remember her as you would want to remember her.'","Abigail Harris, 12, was hit by a Ford Escort while on holiday in Gran Canaria .

"Sumo the cat shocked RSPCA staff earlier this year when the flabby tabby waddled through their doors and tipped the scales at 14.3 kilograms. Now the chubby kitty has lost more than two kilos in as many months enjoying his new found agility and playfulness. One of the vet nurses at the Wacol RSPCA in Brisbane - Tanya Boland - has been caring for Sumo since July and told Daily Mail Australia he's much more active and 'quite amused' he's now able to lick his shrinking belly. Transformation: The pudgy pet has purr-fected his weight loss plan already losing more than two kilos . 'He's doing really well', she said. 'He's been running around, he's a lot more agile.' When he was brought into the RSPCA Vicki Lomax, a veterinarian working at the centre said Sumo was 'the biggest cat I've ever seen and I've been a vet for 45 years.' Sumo came to the RSPCA because his owners were moving house and could not take him with them. When he was brought to the RSPCA centre staff decided to name him and settled, for obvious reasons, on Sumo. But now the pudgy pet, who weighed almost three times his ideal weight of five to six kilos, is loving a more active lifestyle. Before: Just a few months ago Sumo the chubby tabby tipped the scales at 14.3 kilograms . Flabby tabby: Vet nurse Tanya Boland (pictured) has been looking after Sumo since he was brought into Wacol RSPCA in Brisbane back in July . 'He's been playing with my cat and bit more and playing with the toys', Ms Boland said of the the nine-year-old domestic short hair. 'They're like brothers and sisters, sometimes they get a long and sometimes they fight.' '(But) he's a lot more active and he's happy he can lick his belly and his back.' When at his heaviest Sumo was at serious risk of a number of weight-related diseases such as heart and kidney disease, diabetes, muscle atrophy, and arthritis. However a strict diet of a new trial Hills brand metabolic cat food split into two meals a day, the fat cat is sure to be a slim Jim in no time. New tricks: Ms Boland said Sumo is very pleased he can now groom his own belly and back . Cutting back: The chubby cat has been on a portion-controlled diet of low-calorie metabolic cat food . Sumo was put on a special weight loss plan by his vet . The chubby tabby is on low-calorie diet . He's also been given much smaller and more controlled potions of food . His carer Tanya Boland makes sure he only eats a small amount twice a day . Sumo has learned to run around and is getting much more exercise . Keeping up with Ms Boland's younger cat has also helped him shed some kilos . Plus his exercise running up and down the hall of Ms Boland's home with his favourite toy 'rattle mouse' is also helping him shift the weight. Earlier this year Ms Lomax told Daily Mail Australia that as with humans, pets get overweight from a combination of overfeeding and lack of exercise. She warned: 'Cats can be very persistent, there are cats that will follow you to the fridge and more or less demand food. There are owners who have trouble saying no, I guess it's like parents saying no to the kids.' Ms Boland said although she's enjoying the time spent with Sumo and her younger cat Jasmine, her house simply isn't big enough for two cats in the long term. 'I've got a friend's mother who's interested in adopting him', Ms Boland revealed. 'She's had a fat cat before so she knows what they're like to handle.' Though the vet nurse did admit she'll be sad to see Sumo go when he's lost a little more weight. 'He's a funny little character but my house just isn't big enough for two cats.' No more: Sumo used to be so large he could barely move around .","Sumo astonished RSPCA staff and was the biggest cat they'd ever seen .

"Max Clifford arriving at Southwark Crown Court to be sentenced for 8 indecent assaults on young women back in May . Disgraced publicist Max Clifford launched an appeal against his eight-year jail sentence yesterday. Lawyers told the Court of Appeal the prison sentence was too long for the 71-year-old, who was convicted of eight indecent assaults against teenage girls and young women. Richard Horwell QC said Clifford was ‘no longer a danger to women’ and would not commit any further offences. He said the trial judge had been wrong to consider Clifford’s bizarre behaviour outside court when sentencing, when he stood behind a television presenter covering the trial and mimicked his broadcast. And he said the judge at Southwark Crown Court, Judge Anthony Leonard QC, should not have imposed maximum two-year sentences for two of the indecent assaults after saying they were ‘not the gravest offences of their type’. Mr Horwell told the Court of Appeal in London: ‘Although the sentencing process must reflect modern attitudes – and I fully accept that that is our law – the sentencing process must not abandon common sense and fairness.’ Clifford, who abused the young women and girls between 1977 and 1984, watched the court hearing on a videolink from HMP Littlehey, a Category C prison in Cambridgeshire. He looked tired and gaunt and fidgeted during the 90-minute hearing, eventually complaining he could not hear one of the lawyers over the videolink. Rosina Cottage QC, for the Crown, said the trial judge was entitled to impose the eight-year sentence. She said Clifford’s public statements and denials after his arrest and during his trial had been intended to ‘manipulate, undermine and humiliate’ his victims. Richard Horwell QC said Clifford was ‘no longer a danger to women’ and would not commit any more offences . Clifford, of Hersham, Surrey, was prosecuted under 1956 legislation because his offences pre-dated the Sex Offences Act 2003. Under the more recent legislation he could have received a maximum life sentence, the Court of Appeal heard. A decision on his application for leave to appeal against his sentence is due to be announced later this year.","Clifford launched an appeal against his eight-year jail sentence yesterday .

"Children as young as 11 have been victims of ‘revenge porn’, new figures have revealed. School pupils are having their lives ruined by classmates posting explicit images – either obtained consensually or stolen – online without permission to humiliate them. Adults have also been blackmailed into having sex with their tormentors after being threatened with having supposedly private images of them naked placed on the internet. Scroll down for video . Hannah Davison, 21, (right) was mortified when Christopher Todd (left) sent an intimate photo of her to her mother’s phone after their break-up . Demands for tough new laws to crack down on the humiliating practice have increased after celebrities, including pop star Rihanna and movie actress Jennifer Lawrence, fell victim to the cruel craze. Figures uncovered using freedom of information laws revealed 149 cases of revenge porn in the last three years – although campaigners said this was the ‘tip of the iceberg’. Of the eight police forces who responded, the number of incidents had risen from 35 in 2012 to 58 a year later. In the first six months of 2014, there were 56 cases reported – meaning the total is expected to double by the end of the year. Worryingly, only six incidents resulted in a police caution or charge – meaning the culprits in many cases have escaped scot-free. Rihanna and Jennifer Lawrence have both recently had nude photos posted online by a hacker . Police are largely powerless to stop the unpleasant practice until specific new laws intended to make revenge porn a crime, which are currently going through Parliament, are introduced. Laura Higgins, of the UK Safer Internet Centre helpline, said the true scale of the problem remained hidden. She said: ‘I feel this is just the tip of the iceberg. Plenty of people, particularly young people, won’t want to go down the police route or even speak about them at all, so many incidents are going unnoticed. ‘Our research shows that for every site we find, there are potentially dozens with those images on which the victim has no idea about. ‘We are living in an age where technology is a part of our everyday lives, and children are becoming sexualised at a younger age. Former culture secretary Maria Miller has worked to stamp out revenge porn . ‘But we must do what we can to tackle bullying, harassment and sharing explicit content without permission.’ Sarah Green, of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ‘The ability to abuse through technology is growing fast and its impact is very real, which is why politicians and the police must get to grips with it.’ The survey revealed a girl aged just 11 from Manchester had indecent images of her posted on the internet. In Cambridgeshire, a schoolboy circulated naked photos of a fellow pupil on Facebook so all her friends could see them. In another case in the county, a taxi driver blackmailed a passenger into having sex after discovering naked images of her, and another man was coerced into having gay sex amid fears a woman would post naked photos of him on social media. Former culture secretary Maria Miller, who has campaigned to stamp out the despicable trend, said the data showed revenge porn was more widespread than previously thought. She said: ‘Police are finding it difficult to know how to react when incidents are reported. All of this points to the need for a clarification of the law, and also to make sure it’s clear revenge porn and the posting of it is a criminal offence. This is not a victimless crime - it is a sexual act against another individual.’ A Facebook spokesman said: ‘Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content. We encourage people to use our reporting tools to highlight anything they find unacceptable. If it breaks our rules it will be removed.’ Last week the Mail told how a young woman was left distraught after her ex-boyfriend sent naked ‘revenge porn’ pictures of her to her parents. Hannah Davison, 21, was mortified when Christopher Todd sent an intimate photo of her to her mother’s phone after their break-up - in a message then opened by her father. Todd, 22, from Boldon Colliery, Tyne and Wear, was given a suspended sentence for sending the offensive message, which claimed Ms Davison was spreading sexually transmitted diseases.","Children of 11 have been victims of revenge porn, new figures show .

"New York City police have arrested a man on charges of assault as a hate crime after a 24-year-old Orthodox Jewish man was punched in the face.

His three friends were taken into custody, but released without charge. Marajh's lawyer has denied that the attack had anything to do with the brutal game, but New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly said there was no question that the game was the motive for the attack, reports ABC. 'He makes a statement that he was punched in the side of the face,' Kelly said. 'He also makes a statement that just prior to it they were talking about the ""Knockout Game"".' Marajh, right, was released on $750 bail for allegedly attacking Shmuel Perl, left, in the early hours of Friday morning .

At least two deaths have been linked to the attacks this year. New York City police have deployed additional officers to city neighborhoods where at least seven attacks occurred in the past few weeks, including an assault on a 78-year-old woman. Authorities and psychologists say the 'Knockout Game’ assaults have been around for decades - or longer - and it's played mostly by impulsive teenage boys looking to impress their friends.

"Former prime minister Gough Whitlam's childhood home was expected to be demolished within weeks . The demolition of former prime minister Gough Whitlam's birthplace has been put on hold. Mr Whitlam, who died on Tuesday aged 98, was born at the house in Kew, Melbourne. His parents sold it when he was one year old and the family moved to Sydney. The three-bedroom home, which went under the hammer for $3.3 million last year, was given the tick of approval to be ripped down just one week before Whitlam passed away on Tuesday. The demolition order was lodged for the 46 Rowland street site, known as 'Ngara' in April, before an application for heritage protection was rejected by the office of Planning Minister Matthew Guy. However, Mr Guy said on Thursday he had applied for an interim protection order to put the demolition on hold, a move granted by the Heritage Council. City of Boroondara mayor Coral Ross said the council was pleased 'this valuable piece of Australia's history' was being protected for now. The demolition will be on hold for about four months while the issue of heritage protection is examined. Mr Guy said the interim protection order meant works on the property had to stop immediately and it would allow for a fresh consideration of the property's cultural significance given Mr Whitlam's death. He said he had no direct power as planning minister to intervene and any person may apply for an interim protection order as he did. Whitlam's parents took out a house mortgage at the beginning of 1915 and the home was built by May that same year. The house, built in 1915, at 46 Rowland Street has been relatively untouched since the 1920s . The home in the affluent suburb of Kew was sold for $3.3million in November last year . Boroondara council attempted to save the home after declaring it was of 'local individual heritage significance' due to Whitlam living in the house for the first two years of his life until the family moved to Sydney with his father's job in 1918. Following an investigation, the council deemed the home as heritage-worthy due to Whitlam's childhood links to the property before it lodged a heritage protection request to the Victorian Planning Minister in May. However, the planning department rejected the application in September because the demolition order was already approved before receiving the heritage request, the ABC reported. Whitlam's parents built the home in 1915 after taking out a mortgage . Following the sale last year, the home was listed on realestate.com.au as displaying 'splendid original character and grand room proportions offer endless scope to renovate/extend or perhaps create a luxurious new home.' Former owner Gerald Swinnerton, who sold the house in January, met Whitlam, along with his parents, when the politician visited his childhood home in the 1960s. 'He turned up in a Commonwealth car,' Mr Swinnerton told the ABC. 'We had afternoon tea together, and found him to be a charming and congenial fellow.' The Whitlams took a mortgage out from the State Savings Bank of Victoria on 30 January 1915 to build the family home which was completed by May that same year, the Property Observer reported. The announcement of Whitlam's birth was published as taking place at Ngara, Rowland Street, East Kew. Legend has it - that Whitlam was delivered on the kitchen table in the home the following year after it was built. However, two years after his birth, the family uprooted to Sydney after his father, Fred Whitlam, was promoted to deputy Crown solicitor . The living area is one of many rooms with box and bay windows in the home . The house features a large formal dining room and lead light windows looking onto the garden . Whitlam is believed to have been born on the kitchen table in the Kew home in 1916 . Mr Swinnerton said before he and his brother made the sale they expressed their preference for the new owner to only make renovations to the house. 'It's my view that a plaque should be placed in the pavement outside the house,' he said. Neighbour Oliver Barrett said he expected the house, which has been relatively untouched since the 1920s, to be pulled down within a couple of weeks as the demolition process had already begun. He said the fact that many people had visited the home since Whitlam died proved its historical significance. 'We'll lose a large bit of Australian history,' he told the ABC. The house currently features a large formal living and dining room - along with a sun room and box and bay windows.","The demolition of former prime minister Gough Whitlam's birthplace has been put on hold .

"Police have launched a murder investigation after a father of three was shot dead, after confronting two robbers as he closed his business for the night. Pragaret Singh, 35, was shot in the chest and abdomen as he left Manchester Food Traders in Openshaw, Greater Manchester, just after 6pm on Friday. Detectives said Mr Singh, known to friends as Charlie, was believed to have grappled with at least one of the men. Police have launched a murder investigation after father-of-three Pragaret Singh was shot dead outside his business in Openshaw, Greater Manchester, on Friday evening . Armed police who attended the scene found Mr Singh lying in the road. He was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary but pronounced dead at 7.30pm. Mr Singh, who had children aged two, five and seven, had run the wholesale food firm on the Manchester industrial estate for more than 15 years. The victim’s brother, known as Tiggy, said Mr Singh ‘worked 24 hours a day’ to provide for his wife Sukhwinder and children. ‘He was robbed of his life. He was happy, jolly and full of life – he never said anything bad about anyone. ‘He was the kind of person who’d go out of his way to help anyone in need. They could have shot him in the leg, they could have hit him with a stick – but instead they shot him twice. ‘He’s the kind who probably would have put up a fight. He was fit and full of life.’ Detectives said Mr Singh, known to friends as Charlie, was believed to have grappled with at least one of the robbers . Police described one of the attackers as black, in his 20s or 30s, with spiky knotted hair, clean shaven, tall slim build and wearing a jacket with the sleeves rolled up. They are appealing for information about the movements of a small silver car, possibly a Vauxhall, which may have been used by the thieves. Detective Superintendent Jon Chadwick, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘His family are absolutely and utterly distraught and our thoughts are with them. ‘We believe this is the tragic death of an innocent businessman and father of three simply trying to protect his livelihood from criminals. ‘As a result, Charlie’s entire family have suffered an unimaginable loss.’ Police said the robbers made off with a ‘large amount of money’. Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.","Police launch murder investigation after father of three shot dead .

"Yahoo is reportedly preparing to invest £12 million ($20 million) in Snapchat. Despite not yet having a source of revenue, more than 100 million users use the app - which is apparently enough to convince companies to spend vast sums out on the three-year old startup. Yahoo’s move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byer in August. The Wall Street Journal reports that California-based Yahoo (CEO Marissa Mayer shown making her keynote address in January 2014) will invest £12 million ($20 million) in the three year-old tech startup Snapchat. If true the investment would value the company at £6 billion ($10 billion) The move comes after a similar, albeit much larger, investment in Chinese technology firm Alibaba reaped huge dividends for Yahoo, with its $1 billion investment in 40 per cent of the company in 2005 now valued at tens of billions of dollars. This latest move, according to the Wall Street Journal, comes as Snapchat starts to seek funding from venture-capital firms, money managers and companies. Earlier this year Instagram  launched a new ephemeral messaging app called Bolt. The app, which functions in a similar way to Snapchat, allows users to quickly share self destructing photos or videos with a friend. Like Snapchat, the user can tap on a friend's face to instantly send a photo, or hold their finger down to send a video. However, Bolt only allows you to send messages to one person at a time, which makes it frustrating if you’re looking to distribute photos or videos to a group of friends. The favourites bar at the bottom of the app also only contains four friends, though you can apparently add up to 20 contacts in total. Bolt is currently only available in New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa ahead of a planned release in the rest of the world. Snapchat may be a key partner to Yahoo as it gets set to release Snapchat Discovery next year. This is a rumoured service that will display brief ads alongside news and video clips on the app, which will likely become a key source of revenue for Snapchat. Snapchat Discovery would provide a platform for Yahoo to distribute its own content. However, the £6 billion ($10 billion) valuation of a company that hasn't, yet, monetised its users, has been dubbed a risky proposition. That’s not to say it hasn’t worked before; Microsoft’s 2007 investment in Facebook valued the then three-year old company at £9.4 billion ($15 billion), and later proved hugely successful. Last year Snapchat infamously turned down a £1.8 billion ($3 billion) offer from Facebook - a decision that left many stunned. But the move seems to have paid off, as Snapchat’s owners Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy are set to become billionaires according to the current valuations of the company. If the valuation holds true, Snapchat would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of £6 billion ($10 billion) or more, including car-ride service Uber and rooms-to-let startup AirBnB. Yahoo's move follows an almost identical investment from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byer in August this year. However Snapchat is still yet to announce how it plans to make revenue from its more than 100 million users. Pictured are owners Evan Spiegel, left, and Bobby Murphy . Snapchat lets users send photo-messages that vanish within seconds, but is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services. This may include the ability to send instant money transfers to other users. Although Snapchat, and other similar mobile messaging apps, don't have established business models yet, its rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so. Snapchat is continuing to grow in popularity, with people sending more than 700 million disappearing messages a day. In June, Facebook launched a similar app called Slingshot in the hope of replicating Snapchat’s success. The app lets consumers exchange photos and videos, which later disappear, without requiring Facebook accounts. But despite its rapid growth, Snapchat has had a number of obstacles to contend with. The group this year settled charges with US regulators, which accused it of deceiving consumers by promising that photos sent on its service disappeared forever after a period of time. According to the Federal Trade Commission at the time, photos sent on Snapchat could, in fact, be saved by recipients using several methods, such as taking a screenshot.","Reports claim Yahoo is to invest £12 million ($20 million) in Snapchat .

"Charlie Edgeworth, 19, decided to undergo breast reduction surgery after being branded 'Mooby' by bullies for years . A teenage boy sold his car to pay for breast reduction surgery after being bullied at school for years. Charlie Edgeworth, 19, was nicknamed 'Mooby' by cruel bullies when a common medical condition caused him to grow breasts when he was just 13. The call centre worker, from Hastings, East Sussex, suffers from a gynaecomastia - a hormone imbalance meaning he has more oestrogen than testosterone - causing the excess breast tissue. He was so mortified by his B cup chest that he has never had a girlfriend - and used to hide away in baggy jumpers, even in the height of summer. Desperate to reduce his chest, Mr Edgeworth went on a strict diet - causing his weight to plummet to a dangerous nine stone when he was still at school - but it only made his chest more prominent. But after years of torment, he finally decided to sell his car to fund a £2,000 breast reduction - and is hoping his new chest will help him find love. Mr Edgeworth said: 'My moobs stuck out so much the kids called me names for the duration of high school. 'I hadn't taken my top off in public since primary school and never went topless in the house so my mum didn't even know. 'Whenever we went on holiday I always wore a t-shirt in the pool - I just told people I burnt easily to shut them up. 'I tried everything to make them disappear but when I lost weight it just made them stand out more. 'In the end I put weight on to cover up the disparity between my chest and stomach.' In an attempt to hide his embarrassment, he always wore a school jumper one size too big even if the summer sun was blazing. Even after school, his confidence was knocked and his love life took a knock, meaning he hasn't had a girlfriend since he was 13. Mr Edgeworth said: 'It's hard to get close to somebody when you have this hang up. 'It's difficult to keep seeing someone when you're constantly thinking ""I've got bigger boobs than you"". Scroll down for video . Mr Edgeworth suffered from gynaecomastia - a hormone imbalance meaning he had more oestrogen than testosterone - causing him to grow B-cup breasts at age 13 . 'For the last six years I haven't had a serious partner because of it, which is a bloody long time.' Excessive development of male breasts — also known as gynaecomastia — is thought to affect 40 per cent of men and it seems the proportion is rising. High-profile sufferers include Ricky Gervais and Simon Cowell. The condition can be provoked by an imbalance of the sex hormones oestrogen and testosterone. It can also be triggered by certain medication like antidepressants, heart and liver pills, some cancer drugs and illegal drugs like cannabis and anabolic steroids. He now has to wear a compression vest but says he already feels like 'a completely different person' Mr Edgeworth's lowest point came when his previous boss mentioned he looked a bit 'mooby'. After that, he began to look in to surgical options. Three years later, the 19-year-old decided to go under the knife and had 200ml of fat and glandular tissue removed from each breast. The teenager sold his pride and joy - a 2003 Volkswagen Polo - to pay £1,750 for breast reduction and nipple inversion in Poland through EuropeSurgery. To aid the recovery process he must wear a compression vest,  but says he already feels like a completely different person. He said: 'This has been a massive confidence boost and I can't wait to start dating. 'I wasn't expecting the results to be as good as they are. 'It sounds like a cliché, but I feel like my life can begin now. 'If I hadn't gone abroad I would never have been able to afford to have the surgery. 'I looked into it and it's about £5,000 over here. 'With EuropeSurgery they talked me through everything and even let me speak to previous patients, it really put my mind at ease.' Adam Kalecinski, the surgeon who performed Mr Edgeworth's operation, said: 'I am extremely pleased with the results of Charlie's surgery and I am looking forward to seeing him in one of our UK aftercare clinics. 'It's essential to remove glandular tissue as well as fat to stop the problem returning in a couple of years.' Gynaecomastia (sometimes referred to as 'man boobs', or moobs, is a common condition that causes boys’ and men’s breasts to swell and become larger than normal. It is most common in teenage boys and older men. It can be caused by an imbalance between the sex hormones testosterone and oestrogen. Oestrogen causes breast tissue to grow. While all men produce some oestrogen, they usually have much higher levels of testosterone, which stops the oestrogen from causing breast tissue to grow. If the balance of hormones in his body changes, this can cause a man’s breasts to grow. Sometimes, the cause of this imbalance is unknown. The growth in breast tissue is not due to extra body fat from being overweight, so losing weight or doing more exercise will not improve the condition. During puberty, boys’ hormone levels vary. If the level of testosterone drops, oestrogen can cause breast tissue to grow. Many teenage boys have some degree of breast enlargement. As men get older, they produce less testosterone. Also, older men tend to have more body fat, and this can cause more oestrogen to be produced. These changes in hormone levels can lead to excess breast tissue growth.

"The rift between teachers and Michael Gove widened yesterday when a moderate teachers’ union passed a motion of no confidence in the Education Secretary for the first time in its history. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers voted overwhelmingly that Mr Gove and Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw showed an ‘abject failure to improve education or treat teachers, parents and pupils with respect’. More militant unions regularly show dissatisfaction with Government policies in similar debates. But the ATL’s support for the first such motion in its 129 years indicates a hardening of opinion among  teachers and other school staff. Teachers from the ATL union passed a vote of no confidence in Education Secretary Michael Gove (left) and Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw . The two biggest unions – the National . Union of Teachers and the NASUWT – have already announced strike action . over pay, conditions and pensions. There is also anger at Mr Gove’s attempts to toughen exams and get rid of ‘trendy’ methods he believes have lowered standards. ATL member Jean Roberts said teachers . were overstretched and ‘bullying by the two Michaels’ was affecting head . teachers, ‘who seem to feel they have to hand that down to staff’. She . added: ‘We are saying enough is enough.’ Teacher Chrissie Jolinon, from Brent, . north-west London, said teachers were not consulted about changes. She . accused Sir Michael of ‘tinkering’ to ‘drive forward Government policy . for academies’. Earlier, general secretary Dr Mary . Bousted told the conference in  Liverpool that Mr Gove was ‘shamefully . neglecting’ children, and his reforms would damage education, leaving . morale at ‘rock bottom’. She added: ‘In 2013, every aspect of the . curriculum you teach, the qualifications you prepare children to take, . is under attack and review.’ ‘Michael Gove and Sir Michael Wilshaw are like Blood Brothers, with a . pact to suck the life and hope out of our education system and the . teachers who work within it.’ The union’s survey of 996 members on Mr Gove’s performance found 91 per cent rated him a ‘fail’. Three-quarters criticised his . curriculum revisions, which focus on basic maths and English and a . chronological approach to history. ATL general secretary Mary Bousted said Michael Gove and Sir Michael Wilshaw pact to suck the life and hope out of our education system . Changes to GCSEs and A-levels, such as . ditching modules in favour of final exams, are also unpopular. Meanwhile, 60 per cent thought chief schools inspector Sir Michael . should be on ‘special measures’. The NUT and NASUWT last week announced strikes beginning on June 27 and culminating in a national strike before Christmas. They have said they will postpone them if Mr Gove attends constructive talks and delays introducing performance-related pay. Days later, 100 Left-wing academics . wrote to two national papers claiming pupils were doomed to ‘failure and . demoralisation’ under the proposed curriculum, which is out for . consultation until next month. An Ofsted spokesman said: ‘Sir Michael . has said from the outset any provision that is less than good is not . acceptable. That’s a tough message, especially for those schools and . colleges that have been coasting.’ A Department for Education spokesman . said: ‘We need to make sure we have an education system that is robust . and rigorous . This ambition is surely something the ATL should be . supporting.’","Association of Teachers and Lecturers condemns Education Secretary and chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw .

"One of New York’s most iconic hotels, the Waldorf Astoria, is being sold by Hilton Worldwide to a Chinese insurer for nearly $2 billion - the highest ever sale price for a hotel. Under the terms of the $1.95 billion deal with new owners Anbang Insurance Group, Hilton Worldwide will continue to manage the 1,413-room hotel for the next 100 years. The 47-story Park Avenue hotel, which first opened in 1931, will also undergo a major renovation to restore the Art Deco property to its former glories. One of New York’s most iconic hotels, the Waldorf Astoria, is set to be sold by Hilton Worldwide to Anbang Insurance Group for $1.95 billion . Countless movies have been filmed at the Waldorf Astoria including 1993 Oscar winner Scent Of A Woman . The 47-story Art Deco building opened in 1931 and will now undergo a major renovation, once the takeover is complete . Waldorf Astoria New York is the flagship hotel of the Hilton luxury brand, Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts. The world’s largest publicly traded hotel operator, Hilton plans to use the proceeds from the sale to acquire additional hotels in the U.S. The acquisitions will be finalized and announced at a later date, the company said. The sale and 100-year management agreement with Anbang 'will ensure that the Waldorf Astoria New York represents the brand’s world-class standards for generations to come, said Christopher J. Nassetta, president and chief executive officer of Hilton Worldwide, in a statement. The hotel was also featured in the 1988 Eddie Murphy movie Coming To America . Under the terms of the $1.95 billion deal with new owners Anbang Insurance Group, Hilton Worldwide will continue to manage the 1,232-room hotel for the next 100 years . The Waldorf Astoria New York has a rich history that few other hotels can compete with. In March 1893, millionaire William Waldorf Astor opened the 13-story Waldorf Hotel. The Astoria Hotel opened four years later. When the Waldorf Astoria New York opened on Park Avenue in 1931 it was the largest hotel in the world and remains one of the largest Art Deco structures still standing anywhere in the world. In 1993 the city named it - and its spectacular interiors - an official New York City landmark. The hotel prides itself on the design philosophy that no two guest rooms are exactly the same. As well as 1,413 rooms it houses three restaurants - Peacock Alley, Bull and Bear Prime Steakhouse and Oscar's - five lounges not to mention a secret underground train platform  used to enable presidents and VIPs to enter from nearby Grand Central Terminal in secret. Every president since Herbert Hoover has stayed here, including President Obama, who sleeps in the 35th floor Presidential Suite every time he’s in town. Celebrity heiress Paris Hilton even grew up in the hotel and fondly recalls meeting visiting presidents and sneaking into parties and bar mitzvahs.

Paris recently tweeted this picture of her as a toddler with Nancy Reagan . ‘This relationship represents a unique opportunity for our organizations to work together to finally maximize the full value of this iconic asset on a full city block in midtown Manhattan.’ Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel in 1949 and the Hilton Hotels Corporation finally bought the hotel outright in 1972. Hilton announced in February that it would consider selling all or a part of the property. At the time Nassetta also said the company would consider residential, office and retail uses. In December Hilton raised $2.35 billion in a record initial public offering for the hotel industry. The company’s other properties include namesake hotels in San Francisco, New York and Chicago.

"The Conservative Party is planning drastic cuts to welfare entitlements to slash payments to people living on 'Shameless' style housing estates. Works and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith claims that already his party has reduced the numbers of households without work to the lowest levels since records began. He also vowed to curb the entitlements to benefits from new migrants from other EU countries in a bid to secure public support in advance of next year's general election. Scroll down for video . The Tories are planning a range of new measures to clamp down on layabouts such as TV's Frank Gallagher . Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, said he wanted to reduce the numbers of people claiming benefit from abroad .

'We are beginning to change this dependency culture that Labour so bred and are turning it into an independence culture where people see they can take control of their own lives.' The party is meeting in Birmingham for its last conference before next year's general election. Mr Duncan Smith said his party was also considering slashing the £26,000-a-year cap on benefits payments to encourage the work-shy into employment. He said that under the last Labour administration some 80 per cent of new jobs went to foreign nationals while at present, three quarters of new jobs are being filled by British nationals. He claimed that in an average week there were 600,000 vacancies available proving that the economy is improving. He said he wanted to increase the restrictions on new EU migrants from claiming benefits, extending the current three-month ban to two years .

"A murder investigation has been launched after the bones of a homeless woman were found washed up on a remote island. The remains of Angela Millington from Southend, were discovered on Foulness Island, Essex, on June 21. It is not known how long the body had been there but the homeless 33-year-old was identified following forensic and DNA tests - and police now believe she was murdered. The remains of Angela Millington (pictured) were discovered on Foulness Island, Essex, on June 21. Police now believe she was murdered . The last confirmed sighting of Miss Millington was almost a year ago. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Werrett, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'We have launched a murder investigation as we don't know what happened to Angela. 'We are keeping all lines of enquiry open. Anyone with any information, no matter how small, could help us to discover how Angela died and bring her justice.' Ms Millington had no fixed address and was last been seen alive when she visited a housing officer in Westcliff on November 21. She also withdrew money from her bank account that day and her mobile phone has not been used since the end of that month. Mr Werrett added: 'We have not found any of her clothing or belongings. The remains of Ms Millington were found on the marshes of Foulness Island in Essex. Expert reports indicate she did not die there but was either taken there or her body was carried there by the tide . 'Angela was known to associate with street drinkers and local homeless people. 'There was a sighting of her by a police officer in the Porters Grange area of Southend on January 6 but we have no definite details of her movements since November 21. 'The expert reports indicate that she did not die on Foulness but was either taken there or the body was carried there in the tide.' The ramblers initially found a collection of bones as they walked in a salt marsh area along the island's south east coastline. They called police and a full search found further parts of the skeleton. Detectives have been supporting her family and speaking to people who knew her to try and find out how and when she died, Essex Police said. Gary Turner of the Homeless Action Resource Project (HARP) said Miss Millington had used the service intermittently before last being seen at the centre about a year ago. Police and forensic experts were seen examining the crime scene on Foulness Island today . Mr Turner said she was not a regular enough user of the charity to be well-known to staff but expressed sadness at her death. He said: 'The last contact we had with Angela was a year ago, when she popped into one of our sites for a bite to eat and, prior to that, her contact was quite sporadic. 'She wasn’t someone who was a regular user of our services or received key work from a member of staff but it seems she had mental health issues and possibly some substance misuse or addiction issues. Ramblers initially found a collection of bones as they walked in a salt marsh area along the south east coast of Foulness Island, Essex (file picture) 'She had an issue around accommodation, or lack of, and often when people stop accessing our services there’s a natural assumption they have sorted things out and don’t need us anymore. 'But it’s always a sorry thing to hear someone has lost their life, however that may be, particularly someone so young.' Roger Burroughs, chairman of Foulness Parish Council, said it was not unheard of for bodies to wash up on the island though, because of the tight security on the island, residents were not always informed. Police were called to Foulness Island, pictured, in Essex, and a full search found further parts of the skeleton . Mr Burroughs, 69, said: 'We weren't informed of this particular case but it's the kind of thing that Kinetic Security take over because of the nature of the site, so we wouldn't be privy to the information unless they wanted to tell us on the council. 'We've had this situation before, though, where people have washed up or been found and two or three years ago there was a male body washed up.' Anybody with information is asked to contact police on 01702 470173 during office hours or 101 outside of those times. Foulness Island is a large expanse of marshland separated from the mainland by a large number of creeks. Little over 200 people live on the island, which is mainly farmland and has 30 sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) due to its habitat for flocking wild birds, flora and fauna. There are seven working farms on the site spanning 7,000 acres between them. Little over 200 people live on the island, which is mainly farmland and has 30 sites of special scientific interest .

It was first used by the military in 1858 when the British School of Gunnery was opened.

"Charlton are closing on a deal to sign Tony Watt from Standard Liege. The 20-year-old, who shot to prominence when he scored Celtic’s winner in their 2-1 Champions League victory over Barcelona in November 2012, may join the Championship side on an initial loan with a view to a permanent deal. Watt began his career at Airdrie United but was snapped up by Celtic after impressing during the 2010-11 season. Scotland under 21 international Tony Watt (right) joined Standard Liege from Celtic last summer for £1.2m . He spent two years at the Scottish giants with mixed success before they loaned him out to Belgian side Lierse last season. And his eight goals in 17 appearances for the club caught the eye of Standard Liege who bought him last summer.

"What do Jennifer Lopez, Ashton Kutcher and David Hasselhoff have in common? They all swoon over the Koalas at Sydney Wild Life Zoo. This week, Media Animal TV has featured the superstar Koalas at the popular attraction. Despite sleeping for 85 per cent of his day, these mellow marsupials still manage to hang with more stars than Opera Winfrey. Scroll down for video . Pop icon Jennifer Lopez poses with an Australian koala during her visit to WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo in 2012 . Destiny's Child star Kelly Rowland pats a Koala during a visit to WILD LIFE Sydney . Model Erin McNaught poses alongside Buu the koala: The Koalas at Sydney Wildlife Zoo attract celebrities from all corners of the globe . 'We've had all sorts of celebrities here. I saw David Hasselhoff run through the entire zoo before he got to the koalas, just to get there in time to have his photo taken,' says Kylie Hackshaw, the zoo mammal keeper. 'We had Susan Boyle, who was ecstatic and giggly to see our koalas. We've also had Kings Of Leon from the rock front, who were just as excited and they were just lovely when they came in.' So what is it that magnetises Hollywood icons to these koalas? Maybe between all the meet-and-greets and exclusive nightclubs, celebs want to hang with someone who can help them unwind. Few animals know how to relax like the Koala. Media Animal TV also explored a day in the life of Aaron, an adolescent koala who sleeps for 20 hours a day. Baywatch star David Hasselfoff, who zookeeper Kylie Mackshaw says 'ran through the entire zoo before he got to the koalas, just to get there in time to have his photo taken' A koala in the enclosure snaps a selfie from a motion sensor camera inside the koala enclosure . Hackshaw says the koalas job is 'just to sit there and look cute' 'Some people think he might be a bit sloth like, but that's just a typical Koala' Hackshaw says. 'He's a pampered little Koala. He gets the best leaves twice a day and fresh water every day.' 'His job is just to sit there and look cute.' Sadly, it seems like all the celebrity attention could be going to their heads. Earlier this year, we learned the Sydney Wildlife Koalas were infatuated with taking selfies after a collection of pouting snaps from inside their enclosure made a splash online. It seems all that time rubbing shoulders with the stars has started to make them conceited, but in the end of the day, who can blame them?","The koalas at the zoo attract  celebrities from all corners of the globe .

"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . A man has been jailed for setting fire to a family dog in an 'evil and vile' attack, which sparked widespread revulsion across Northern Ireland. More than 60,000 people signed a petition online after Andrew Richard Stewart, 23, doused border collie Cody in diesel before setting her alight during the savage attack in August 2012. The three-year-old dog was left so badly burned that her ribs and other joints were visible through the charred flesh. Andrew Richard Stewart, 23, (left) was jailed for 20 months after setting fire to a dog before setting it alight. His co-defendant Jamie Downey (right) was jailed for perverting the course of justice . Cody, a three-year-old border collie, had followed the two men from her home in Maghaberry, Co Antrim, to a quarry where Stewart doused her in diesel and set her alight . The owner of the black-and-white dog, Natalie Agnew, initially failed to recognise her brutally injured pet as it limped home across a field near their home in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Cody had to be put down two weeks later, when vets said she would never recover from her injuries. Stewart and his co-defendant Jamie Downey had been partying together and had gone for a stroll round the village of Maghaberry to walk-off the effects of alcohol when Cody attached herself to the duo. She followed them from outside the Agnew home to a nearby quarry where the two men played fetch with the dog. But when Downey went to urinate, Stewart doused the animal in diesel and ignited her coat. Today, Stewart was jailed at Belfast Crown Court for 20 months, after pleading guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. Animal rights campaigners - who have gone along to all the court hearings and held banners and posters outside the court buildings - applauded as he was taken down to the cells. They had filled the public gallery  to capacity and some were wearing Justice For Cody T-shirts. The 23-year-old, from Aghalee, Co Antrim, was also banned from keeping animals for 30 years. His co-defendant Jamie Downey, also 23, from Moira, Craigavon, Co Armagh, was jailed for six months after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice. The jail terms are the first custodial sentences believed to have been imposed in Northern Ireland since new animal cruelty legislation came into effect in 2011. Cody's owners, Natalie and Martin Agnew, were at Belfast Crown Court today to see Stewart sentenced for the brutal attack . Speaking outside court, Ms Agnew said: 'We are absolutely delighted after the two-year-long fight that we have had for justice. We have more than we expected so, we are delighted. It is some sort of closure for us' Jailing Stewart, Belfast Recorder Judge David McFarland said: 'This was a particularly appalling act on Stewart's part. Cody was a much-loved pet. 'Stewart savagely attacked her (Cody) in the most evil and vile fashion. 'It is beyond comprehension that any human being could act in such a manner towards a defenceless creature, which was posing no threat to him.' Stewart had denied the charge of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal for two years but changed his plea to guilty during the second day of his trial last month. The dramatic U-turn happened minutes before Mrs Agnew and her son Jake were due to give evidence happened after Downey decided to tell the truth, the court heard. Some 70 animal rights campaigners have attended the court hearings, some holding posters saying 'Justice for Cody' At the time of the attack,  more than 60,000 people pledged support for the Justice for Cody Facebook campaign. This poster, held outside court, features photos of the Agnew family with Cody . Stewart, who was 21 at the time of the offence, stood in the dock flanked by prison guards with his hands clasped to his front, staring straight ahead. The defendant had looked teary during parts of the court hearing, but he made no expression when he was sentenced. The judge said he had taken into account the anguish suffered by the dog's owners, Natalie and Martin Agnew and their two young sons - one of whom was only six at the time. Mrs Agnew, who was visibly relieved outside court, said her children are still having trouble sleeping at night . He said: 'This was a well-structured family, living in what would appear to be a normal happy family life in a quiet village in rural Northern Ireland. 'The parents and two young boys had a much loved pet, which was so cruelly taken from them. 'Each has had to suffer the anguish of seeing their dog with these serious injuries, of living through the attempted rehabilitative treatment, and then the parents will have had to come to the decision to end Cody's life in circumstances which were not of their making or choosing. 'Subsequent to that decision, there has followed a period of two years of having to live and re-live the events and finally the preparation for the trial which would have necessitated both Natalie Agnew and young Jake having to give evidence. 'For the parents, they have had the unenviable task of having to explain to their young sons how this could have happened -- why any human being would do such a thing to an animal, particularly their beloved family pet.' Stewart's defence barrister said it had been a senseless act that was completely out of character and which had happened after Stewart had consumed a heavy mixture of alcohol over two days. The judge rejected claims Stewart was sorry. He said: 'In this case there has been no remorse. In my view the recent expressions of regret are merely evidence of self-pity. The plea was very late, and the change of mind only followed when Downey had indicated to his counsel that he was now prepared to tell the truth.' Although both men argued about what had happened, Downey agreed to stand by his friend and they concocted a web of lies for the police. The court heard Downey had wanted to come clean about what happened but was intimidated by the widespread publicity surrounding the case. The three-year-old dog was so badly burned that her ribs and other joints were visible through the charred flesh . The black and white dog was so badly injured that Mrs Agnew failed to recognise her  as she limped home across a field after the attack . Prosecutors agreed to leave animal cruelty charges against Downey on the court books after he had an 11th-hour change of heart and admitted perverting the course of justice at the trial last month. Jailing him for six months, the judge said even though he was not involved in setting fire to the dog, Downey had done nothing to help the defenceless animal. Judge McFarland added: 'He did nothing to alleviate the suffering of Cody knowing that she had been injured in a most grievous fashion, and then through some misguided loyalty to Stewart agreed with him to concoct what were false stories to divert police attention away from both defendants. 'No-one is ever punished for the company they keep and the friendships they maintain, but I have to say Downey did show extremely poor judgement in promoting his friendship with Stewart, knowing the conduct that Stewart was capable of.' Cody had to be put down two weeks after the attack, when vets said she would never recover from her injuries . Downey, who was dressed in a grey suit, grey shirt and blue tie showed no emotion as the sentence was passed. Speaking outside the court Cody's owners said they were pleased with the outcome. Ms Agnew said: 'We are absolutely delighted after the two-year-long fight that we have had for justice. We have more than we expected so, we are delighted. It is some sort of closure for us.' The family now have two new dogs but Mrs Agnew said her two sons were still coming to terms with the tragedy. She added: 'The kids are still having trouble sleeping at night and dealing with the issues. We still have the questions that we can't answer. While we do have a sense of closure we still have to deal with the ongoing problems with our children. 'I have thrown all my emotions into fighting for justice and I think now the reality is going to hit - the true horror of what happened. In a sense we are delighted but there are hard times ahead as well.' The Agnews also said they hoped the sentences act as a deterrent. More than 60,000 people pledged support for the Justice For Cody Facebook campaign in the aftermath of the attack. An internet fund has so far raised £30,000 for animal shelters in Northern Ireland and the Guide Dogs Association. The Agnew family have expressed gratitude for the public support they have received. Paying tribute to the 70 plus campaigners who attended the court hearings, Mrs Agnew said: 'They have inspired us to go on with the fight whenever we thought it was a hopeless case to be honest at the start. Without them we wouldn't be where we are today.' Stewart, who will serve ten months in prison before serving the remaining ten on licence, was ordered to pay Cody's owners compensation of £2,600.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Little Allison's neck was cut by the sharp fishing line. Mrs Keeth said: 'Even if it was a prank that was supposed to be funny or bad, I mean it could really hurt somebody. And I would like to know who did this and I want them to see my daughter’s neck.' She said she believed her daughter would suffer lasting damage. Management at the store said they would check CCTV footage to determine whether they could identify . Mrs Keeth added that Walmart has launched its own investigation and will determine whether they are responsible for the incident.

"Stay-at-home mom Tessa Bailey, 30, has worked her way into the bestseller lists with her erotic novels . It's the fastest selling adult novel of all time, shifting a staggering 15 million copies in the US and Canada, and an extra four million in the UK. So it's hardly surprising that women across New York are hoping to harness the Fifty Shades effect by dabbling in a spot of mommy porn. But these women might not be what you'd expect from erotic fiction writers. The New York Post met a stay-at-home mum, a teacher and a pharmacist storming their way up the bestseller lists with their risque, bondage-filled novels. Stay-at-home mom Tessa Bailey, 30, began her career as an author two years ago by snatching moments to write while her three-year-old daughter napped. 'I'd sneak in words whenever I could,' she told the paper. Tessa is now creator of eight titles, including the bestselling 'Line of Duty' series, which features a steamy assortment of police and fire officers. The mom has earned enough money in royalty checks that last June her husband was able to quit his job as a bartender. He is now the primary caregiver for their daughter, so Tessa can focus on her writing career. Tessa's name has consistently appeared on The New York Times and USA Today bestseller lists for adult romance. With born-again Christian parents, Tessa initially refused to disclose her pen name after securing her first publishing deal in December 2012. 'Eventually I told them and it was like ripping off a Band-Aid,' she added. 'I showed them [the manuscript] and said, 'This is the C-word and the P-word and the F-word. They're all there!' Tali Alexander (right) is a pharmacist by day and erotic fiction writer by night. The author of Love in Rewind (left) describes herself as 'every woman out there that has fantasies in her head . Tessa believes her success is largely thanks to the rough, dirty-talking men in her books, one - an Irish bartender - she admits is based on her Dublin-born husband, Patrick, 44. High-school teacher T.D. Hassett, 41, wrote Loving Link by making the most of her time after school hours and over vacations . 'The book is called Unfixable, but he jokingly calls it 50 Shades of Patrick!' she said. High-school teacher T.D. Hassett, 41, from Connecticut moonlights as an erotic writer by making the most of her time after school hours and over  vacations. But the mother-of-two, whose novels include 'Darling's Desire' and 'Loving Link', said she makes a point of keeping her two very different jobs separate. 'I certainly wouldn't put out anything on the school e-mail, saying: 'Buy my hot romance novel!' she said. 'But it's kind of fun, knowing that I have this whole other side to my life.' The teacher told the New York Post that she draws inspiration for her novels from her 'wild' days as a college student. 'The erotic material is a mixture of imagination and personal experience,' she said. Pharmacist Tali Alexander, 35, from Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, also juggles a successful writing career with motherhood and an un-related day job. Tali, who is the author of Love in Rewind, describes herself as 'every woman out there that has fantasies in her head. She adds: 'I am a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a wife, a lover, a mother, and a friend. I happen to also be a Doctor of Pharmacy and a business owner by day, and now a writer by night.'","Stay-at-home mom Tessa Bailey, 30, is making a mark on bestseller lists .

"Solar storms are listed as one of most serious threats on the National Risk Register, alongside flu and volcanic eruptions. To monitor the threat, the Met Office has today opened a public forecasting service that will measure the solar climate, track flares and monitor the Earth's magnetic field. The centre in Exeter will allow anyone to find out about weather in Earth's orbit and look out for potential disruptions, which could affect power grids and radio transmissions. Scroll down for video . Solar storms are listed as one of most serious threats on the National Risk Register, alongside flu and volcanic eruptions. To monitor the threat, the Met Office has today opened a public forecasting service that will measure the solar climate, track flares and monitor the Earth's magnetic field . The centre has been monitoring space weather for a number of weeks, working with experts across at the Met Office in the UK and in the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - which already has a prediction service. The forecasts will be put together by analysing images and solar activity data by satellites and ground-based instrument. They will be available to view on the Met Office website. Solar storms are caused by violent eruptions on the surface of the sun and are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. CMEs are the most energetic events in our solar system - involving huge bubbles of plasma and magnetic fields being spewed from the sun’s surface into space. Solar storms are caused by violent eruptions on the surface of the sun and are accompanied by coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. CMEs are the most energetic events in our solar system - involving huge bubbles of plasma and magnetic fields being spewed from the sun’s surface into space (illustrated) They are often preceded by a solar flare - a massive release of energy from the sun in the form of gamma rays, X-rays, protons and electrons. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of manned missions. But they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. A solar superstorm occurs when a CME of sufficient magnitude tears into the Earth’s surrounding magnetic field and rips it apart. Such an event would induce huge surges of electrical currents in the ground and in overhead transmission lines, causing widespread power outages and severely damaging critical electrical components. Ashley Dale, who was a member of an international task force - dubbed Solarmax - set up to identify the risks of a solar storm and how its impact could be minimised, warned of the danger man faces from 'solar super-storms.' And the need to monitor such risks has become even greater, warn experts, as society is ever more dependent on technology. Mr Dale, carrying out doctoral research in aerospace engineering at Bristol University, said it is only a 'matter of time' before an exceptionally violent solar storm is propelled towards Earth. 'Without power, people would struggle to fuel their cars at petrol stations, get money from cash dispensers or pay online,' he said. 'Water and sewage systems would be affected too, meaning that health epidemics in urbanised areas would quickly take a grip, with diseases we thought we had left behind centuries ago soon returning.' This image of a huge solar flare (top left) was captured by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). One of the most dramatic features is the way the entire surface of the sun seems to ripple with the force of the eruption . The largest ever solar super-storm on record occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event, named after the English astronomer Richard Carrington who spotted the preceding solar flare. This massive CME released about 1022 kJ of energy - the equivalent to 10 billion Hiroshima bombs exploding at the same time - and hurled around a trillion kilos of charged particles towards the Earth at speeds of up to 3000 km/s. However, its impact on the human population was relatively benign as our electronic infrastructure at the time amounted to no more than about 124,000 miles (200,000 km) of telegraph lines. Nasa scientists have predicted that the Earth is in the path of a Carrington-level event every 150 years on average. This means that we are currently five years overdue - and that the likelihood of one occurring in the next decade is as high as 12 per cent.","Met Office has opened a Space Weather Operations Centre in Exeter .

"What has two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a sesame bun? Burger King's latest sandwich. The Miami-based chain says it's bringing back its 'Big King' sandwich, which looks a lot like the popular Big Mac made by its bigger rival McDonald's. Burger King says it's an addition to the permanent menu rolling out this week. Burger King says it previously offered the Big King as a limited-time offer. But back then, it didn't have the middle bun — a Big Mac hallmark — like it does now. A representative for McDonald's didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The return of the Big King, which resembles a Big Mac, is another recent move since investment firm 3G Capital took Burger King public again 2012 . It's just the latest move by Burger King that seems to pay more than a little homage to the Golden Arches. Last spring, Burger King also unveiled a revamped menu that looked a lot like the food McDonald's had added in recent years, such as fruit shakes, chicken snack wraps and specialty coffee drinks. Since then, Burger King has also rolled out a rib sandwich to compete with the popular McRib, as well as chicken nuggets (Burger King is better known for its chicken tenders). As the New York Post wrote at the time, ""They look like McNuggets. They're as nutritious as McNuggets. Just don't call them McNuggets."" 510 Calories . 780 milligrams of sodium . 65 milligrams of cholesterol . 29 grams of fat . 550 calories . 970 milligrams of sodium . 75 milligrams of cholesterol . 29 grams of fat . The changes come under new management for Burger King Worldwide Inc., which has undergone numerous owners over the years. 3G Capital, an investment firm run by Brazilian billionaires, bought the chain and took it private in 2010. It took it public again last year in a deal that allowed it to earn back what it paid while still maintaining a majority stake. Since then, 3G has moved CEO Bernardo Hees on to another assignment over in Pittsburgh, where he's heading up H.J. Heinz. 3G bought the ketchup maker with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. In Mr Hees' place, 3G installed another one its principals, Daniel Schwartz, who was 32 at the time. The classic: The McDonald's Big Mac, shown here, is what the Big King is gunning for .

Burger King also recently introduced lower-calorie fries that it dubbed as 'Satisfries. Notably, Burger King has been touting the fries as having 30 percent fewer calories than regular fries. But the comparison is to McDonald's fries, not its own fries. Satisfries have 20 percent fewer calories than Burger King's own fries.","The burger was previously a limited-time offer, but will now go permanent .

"Blastoff for the spacecraft which could one day take humans to Mars is set for the final countdown as Nasa begins assembling the giant rockets that will propel it into orbit. The huge Delta IV Heavy rocket has been put together for the first time at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida ahead of a first test flight of the Orion capsule in December. It will blast the experimental  capsule in orbit - although the rockets are then expected to be replaced by Nasa's even bigger Space Launch system. Scroll down for video . The huge Delta IV Heavy rocket has been put together for the first time at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida ahead of a first test flight of the Orion capsule in December, a mission known as Exploration Flight Test-1. The three Delta IV Common Booster Cores were attached in ULA's Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF), at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida . During its Dec. 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space. It will then take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. The entire mission will last 4½ hours. The three primary core elements of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta IV Heavy rocket have now been put together, forming the first stage of the launch vehicle that will send Orion far from Earth to allow NASA to evaluate the spacecraft's performance in space. The three Delta IV Common Booster Cores were attached in ULA's Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF), at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The HIF building is located at Space Launch Complex 37 where the mission will lift off. The first booster was attached to the center rocket in June with the second one was attached in early August. 'The day-to-day processing is performed by ULA,' said Merri Anne Stowe of Nasa's Fleet Systems Integration Branch of the Launch Services Program (LSP). 'Nasa's role is to keep a watchful eye on everything and be there to help if any issues come up.' Stowe explained that during major testing experts from Nasa's Launch Services Program monitor the work on consoles in Hanger AE at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Hangar AE is home to the Kennedy Space Center's upgraded Launch Vehicle Data Center. The facility allows engineers to monitor voice, data, telemetry and video systems that support expendable launch vehicle missions. In the Horizontal Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, two core elements of a Delta IV Heavy rocket are brought together in preparation for Exploration Flight Test-1. United Launch Alliance technicians prepare the second stage of a Delta IV Heavy rocket for mating to the central core booster of the three booster stages for the unpiloted Exploration Flight Test-1. The three common booster cores are 134 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter. Each has an RS-68 engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant producing 656,000 pounds of thrust. All totaled, the three Delta IV boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust. The second stage of the Delta IV rocket is 45 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter. It uses one RL10-B-2 engine, also burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant creating 25,000 pounds of thrust. NASA's Florida spaceport is also where Orion was built and is being processed. The Delta IV rocket stages were assembled at the ULA plant in Decatur, Alabama, about 20 miles west of Huntsville. After completion, the rocket components were shipped down the Tennessee River and Tombigbee Waterway, a canal, to the Gulf of Mexico. From there they traveled to Cape Canaveral, arriving on May 6. The elements of the rocket's first stage were then transported to the HIF for preflight processing. 'After the three core stages went through their initial inspections and processing, the struts were attached, connecting the booster stages with the center core,' Stowe said. 'All of this takes place horizontally.' The three common booster cores are 134 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter. Each has an RS-68 engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant producing 656,000 pounds of thrust. All totaled, the three Delta IV boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust. The second stage of the Delta IV rocket is 45 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter. It uses one RL10-B-2 engine, also burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant creating 25,000 pounds of thrust. The SLS rocket that will blast the capsule into orbit will be the largest ever built . 'The second stage was taken to the Delta Operations Center for processing after it arrived,' said Stowe. 'The second stage was moved to the HIF on Aug. 29 and is scheduled to be horizontally mated to the first stage on Sept. 12.' The same upper stage will be used on the block 1 version of NASA's new heavy-lift rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS). More powerful than any rocket ever built, SLS will be capable of sending humans aboard Orion to deep-space destinations such as an asteroid and Mars. 'The hardware for Exploration Flight Test-1 is coming together well,' Stowe said. 'We haven't had to deal with any serious problems. All of the advance planning appears to be paying off.' Once all the launch vehicle stages are mated and thoroughly checked out, the next step is the Test Readiness Review. U.S. Navy divers adjust a tow line on a test version of the capsule as it is towed towards the USS Anchorage during a recovery drill off the coast of California . 'These meetings are held to bring together all the interested parties to be sure the Delta IV rocket is ready for the move to the launch pad where the Orion spacecraft will be mated,' Stowe said. The upcoming flight test will use the Delta IV Heavy to launch the Orion and send it 3,600 miles in altitude beyond the Earth's surface. During the two-orbit, four-hour mission, engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety, the launch abort system, the heat shield and the parachute system. The data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models. The flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later Orion flights. The capsule will re-enter Earth's atmosphere at speeds approaching 20,000 mph, generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. NASA's Orion spacecraft  departs the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building on its way to the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center. Orion is scheduled for a test flight in early December. The Lockheed Martin-built Orion is designed to take humans farther than ever before. The spacecraft will serve as the exploration vehicle that will carry astronauts to space and provide safe re-entry from deep-space missions. Orion currently is undergoing final assembly in Kennedy's Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building. Stowe is especially invested in a successful outcome for the flight test. 'What I'm looking forward to most,' she said, 'is seeing that Orion capsule being retrieved from the Pacific.' During its Dec. 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space and take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. The entire mission will last 4½ hours. The second Orion flight won't occur until around 2018 when another unmanned capsule soars atop NASA's new megarocket, still under development, called SLS for Space Launch System. A test version of NASA's Orion capsule is shown after being recovered by the USS Anchorage off the coast of California in September . NASA intends to put astronauts aboard Orion in 2021 for deep space exploration; each capsule can accommodate up to four. The plan is to use Orion for getting humans to asteroids and Mars — no space station ferry trips for Orion. While Orion may resemble an oversize Apollo capsule on the outside, everything inside and out is modern and top-of-the-line, officials noted Thursday. 'I'm as excited as can be,' said Nasa's Orion production operations manager, Scott Wilson. For Orion's dry run, the Lockheed Martin Corp.-built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast, and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays. A Delta IV rocket will do the heavy lifting. It will eventually be launced by Nasa's new Space Launch System 'megarocket'. For its first flight test, SLS will be configured for a 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed Orion spacecraft beyond low-Earth orbit. In its most powerful configuration, SLS will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons (143 tons), which will enable missions even farther into our solar system, including such destinations as an asteroid and Mars. NASA's Orion spacecraft, preparing for it's first flight, arrives at the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center . When asked by a reporter, Cabana said he wishes Orion's flight pace was quicker. 'But it is what it is,' he said. 'Given the budget that we have, I think we've got the best program that you could imagine.' Orion has its roots in the post-Columbia shuttle era; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low Earth orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the Constellation moon project.","Three Delta IV boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust .

"A row has broken out in a Lidl supermarket where Polish workers were told to stop speaking their native language and address customers in English. Staff at the store in Kirkcaldy, Fife, say they were banned from conversing in Polish during their breaks and told to only speak English on the shop floor. But workers have hit back at bosses - insisting many of their customers only speak Polish and do not understand English. Lidl in Kirkcaldy, Fife is at the centre of a row after Polish workers hit out at being told to speak English . One member of staff, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'I tried to explain to the manager that many customers who do not speak English correctly come to our shop because they know there is a Polish service at the cash desk, bakery and shop floor as well. 'The manager became irritated and told me to carry out his orders.' The worker said they were told they'd be sent home if they were heard speaking their own language again. The worker added: 'I have been living Scotland for nearly 10 years and I have never experienced any kind of discrimination. 'It is very sad to be forced to be forced to speak English to people who do not understand it and feel confused as they expect to be served in Polish.' The issue has sparked a row in the Scottish town, which has a large Polish community and recently hosted its own festival of Polish culture. A petition at 'The Polish Shop' in the town's High Street has gathered 100 signatures and Lidl workers intend to forward it to the firm's European headquarters in Germany. The store insists it is company policy that all staff speak English 'for the benefit of all customers' One Polish customer, 35, said: 'I think this is one of the most ridiculous ideas I have ever heard in my life. 'I cannot imagine an opposite situation, where a British worker is not allowed to speak to a British customer in the English language anywhere in Europe.' A Lidl spokesman said: 'We understand that in certain regions of the UK there are other official languages in use and we welcome the use of these in our stores. 'We also ask that, if possible, our staff respond to customers in the language in which they are addressed. 'We do have a general policy in the UK stating that we carry out our working communication in English, such as when speaking to fellow employees on the shop floor. 'As a business we have to have this in place to help reduce misunderstandings and encourage the building of good relationships across the business and with customers. 'Whilst staff are on their break, they are of course welcome to converse in their language of choice. 'We only ask that they consider their colleagues who may be sharing rest facilities at the same time.'","Polish staff in Kirkcaldy say they were told not to speak in their own tongue .

"Fortnum & Mason has been the royal grocer for more than 150 years, but the top food emporium has been forced to make a grovelling apology to the Queen after it was exposed for wrongly claiming to sell meat from Her Majesty’s farms. This column discovered that the Windsor estate stopped supplying lamb, pork and bacon to Fortnum’s in August after being constantly ‘bullied’ into cutting its prices. However, the expensive grocer in London’s Piccadilly then began sourcing its pork and bacon from elsewhere in the country while its labels falsely claimed that the produce still came from the Royal Farms. Scroll down for video . What's in the box? The Queen, Camilla and Kate inspect hampers made by Fortnum & Mason, but the top food emporium has been forced to make a grovelling apology to the Queen after it was exposed for wrongly claiming to sell meat from Her Majesty’s farms . It withdrew these labels last Thursday only after my investigations began into its suppliers. ‘The Royal Household stopped selling Royal Farms meat to Fortnum & Mason on August 9,’ confirms a Buckingham Palace spokesman, declining to say if it is considering legal action against the store, which holds two royal warrants. Last Thursday, nearly two months after the final delivery of Royal Farms meat to Fortnum’s, well-heeled shoppers could still buy what it claimed was ‘Windsor smoked streaky bacon’ and ‘Windsor green streaky bacon’ for £14 a kilo — double the price of bacon in one of the big supermarkets — as well as ‘Windsor Estate belly pork’. Pressure: The Windsor estate stopped supplying lamb, pork and bacon to Fortnum’s in August after being constantly ‘bullied’ into cutting its prices . End of an era: A Royal Farms source says it decided to end its decade-long relationship with Fortnum’s after the grocer began bullying its suppliers by rounding down the prices it paid for pork, bacon and lamb . The meats were labelled as being ‘From the Royal Farms in Windsor Park, Berkshire’. Fortnum’s now says the belly pork comes fom a supplier about 150 miles away in Norfolk and the bacon from Gloucestershire. ‘There was an unintentional error with product labelling,’ claims a spokesman for Fortnum & Mason. ‘As soon as we became aware of the issue, we apologised to the relevant parties at Buckingham Palace.’ Fortnum’s is owned by Wittington Investments, parent company of discount clothing chain Primark. Owners: Fortnum’s is owned by Wittington Investments, parent company of discount clothing chain Primark . The controversy is another blow to consumer confidence after last year’s horse meat scandal in which some of Britain’s best-known supermarkets were discovered to be selling beef products contaminated with pig and horse meat. A Royal Farms source says it decided to end its decade-long relationship with Fortnum’s after the grocer began bullying its suppliers by rounding down the prices it paid for pork, bacon and lamb. Fortnum’s spent an annual £300,000 on Royal Farms pigs alone, receiving deliveries of fresh meat six times a week. A spokesman says it will give refunds to ‘any customer who can demonstrate proof of purchase’, adding: ‘We take the provenance of our products very seriously and obviously never meant to mislead our customers.’","Estate stopped supplying grocer's with lamb, pork and bacon in August .

"Americans seem to be stuck in a rut when it comes to lunchtime decisions, preferring cold cut classics like turkey and ham to more adventurous fare, reports Business Insider. That's according to a Datassential, a menu research firm that surveyed thousands of Americans who had eaten a sandwich in the last week and broke the results down to show the most popular choice. The overall winner was turkey, which 14 percent of respondents had eaten in the past two weeks, followed by ham at 11 percent. Winner: Traditional turkey beat all comers to top the list of most eaten sandwich for Americans, showcased her with radishes and avocado . Other cold cuts fell farther down the list, with roast beef coming in ninth and cured meats like pastrami finishing twelfth. The most surprising fact of the survey might be that four percent of people like their peanut butter and jelly sandwiches served hot. At least they all make the simple sandwich at home. Deli: Ham also had a decent showing, with 11 percent of Americans who had eaten a sandwich going the ham route . When Americans went out for a bite, the most popular choice was a sub. Were they perhaps visiting the home of the $5 footlong? Drip: Grilled cheese failed to break the top five sandwiches, melting to eighth place in the ranking behind chicken and BLT . Purchasing a sandwich instead of making one at home also allowed people to experiment with choices that were exotic or regional. Only one percent of respondents had eaten a french dip beef sandwich, a Philly cheese steak or a torta or other Mexican sandwich, but those who had indulged did so away from home. Perhaps the biggest hurdle to more creative bites is know-how. Yahoo! Food reported that the most popular sandwich search was chicken salad, followed by the cucumber sandwich, which doesn't even make Datassential's top 30.","A survey by Datassential of thousands of Americans who had eaten a sandwich in the past week and found 14 percent had eaten turkey and 11 percent had eaten ham .

"A North Korean version of the Apple iPad has been developed by the secretive state, it has been revealed. But the slick seven-inch tablet, called the 'Samjiyon', is unlikely to provide a window into life behind the secretive country's border as it can't connect to the internet. Since its announcement in 2012, the computer has been developed using a basic version of Google's android software. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A North Korean version of the Apple iPad has been released - but it cannot connect to the internet . The seven-inch Samjiyon tablet has been developed using a basic version of Google's android software . And, after being put on general sale in North Korea, reviews on technology websites have begun to filter through into the outside world. Compared to its pricey western versions, the Samjiyon costs the equivalent around £155 and comes with a selection of pre-loaded apps, one of which is a version of Angry Birds. Although the handheld device cannot access the world wide web, it is designed to be able to connect to North Korea's own intranet, where state propaganda, news, TV programs and educational apps are hosted. One of the apps is a language acquisition tool which teaches users basic English. It also comes loaded with over 100 eBooks, although they, like the intranet come with a nationalistic theme. Most of the publications are about North Korean political, military and cultural history. The hend held device is smaller than the latest iPad air with a 7inch 1,024 by 768 pixel display, comapred to the Apple machine's 9.7inch 2,048 by 1,536 resolution. After being released, reviews on technology websites have begun to filter through to the outside world . Although it cannot access the world wide web, it is designed to be able to connect to North Korea's intranet . The machine is only likely to be available to a select few in North Korea, with the majority of the population having nowhere near the disposable incomes required to splash out on tech. But it seems that the regime known for closely guarding its state activities is happy for their technology to pass freely over its borders. One reviewer on the website NorthKoreaTech told how they were allowed to buy the item before taking it freely through an airport and into a neighbouring country. After having a play around with the product, the tech blogger said the performance of the tablet was comparable to western models. The review reads: 'I can honestly say that the Samjiyon is surprisingly impressive. TALE OF THE TABLETS - TECH SPECS OF THE iPAD AND THE SAMJIYON . 'In terms of responsiveness and speed, it can almost compete against the leading tablets out there. 'Tapping and launching apps feels fairly fluid, instantiating the camera is as fast as the world’s leading tablets, and there is no noticeable lag when playing games I’m familiar with, like Angry Birds.' One of those who has seen the the tablet is Professor Ruediger Frank from the University of Vienna, writing on the tech blog 38 North, he said: 'The tablet has obviously been made for people who mainly use it offline. 'This gadget is not available to all North Koreans; just as a Mercedes Benz S-class sedan is out of reach for most Germans. 'The existence of this tablet does not in any way change the fact that [North Korea] is, for many of its people, a country of hard manual labour and simple living conditions.

"Shaun Barker (pictured), 33, was reported missing to Queensland police on January 14 . It's been a lengthy investigation into what police described as a 'vicious and horrific murder'. Today three men were arrested over the brutal death of a Gold Coast man over what's believed to be a drug-related matter. Police allege Shaun Barker, 33, was taken against his will late last year and was subsequently tortured and held inside an esky before he was murdered. The remains of his body, which was burnt then buried in a forest, was discovered by forestry workers on April 10. Homicide detectives have been investigating the matter since Mr Barker was reported missing by his sister on January 14. Police say the 33-year-old, who's had previous dealings with police, was last sighted at a service station at Broadbeach in the Gold Coast - southeastern Queensland - on December 10, where he was assaulted and abducted. The next day, it is believed that he was transported to Cooloola Cove in the Sunshine Coast - southeast Queensland - where he was then tortured and held in an esky for a 'lengthy period of time'. Police allege Mr Barker (pictured) was taken against his will late last year and was subsequently tortured and held inside an esky before he was murdered . Queeensland's South Eastern Regional Crime Coordinator Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson wasn't able to specify how long Mr Barker was kept inside the esky but believes it could've been 'a day or days'. Mr Barker was killed and his body was then burnt, Superintendent Hutchinson said on Saturday. 'It was certainly one of the most horrific ones [murders] that have occurred in recent times,' he said. 'What we are investigating here not only is a death but quite a vicious and horrific murder.' Police were able to identify and recover Mr Barker's remains after a skull was initially found by forestry workers in the Toolara State Forest on April 10. Police appealing for information about a white Toyota Landcruiser station wagon, which at the time had a Queensland registration 817SBZ . It is believed this is the vehicle which transported Mr Barker from the petrol station to Cooloola Cove on December 11, 2013 . Three men were arrested and charged on Saturday morning in relation to Mr Barker's death. They include a 37-year-old Gold Coast man and two men from Cooloola Cove, aged 45 and 22. The 45-year-old was arrested at Brisbane Airport after his flight landed from Thailand which was where he had been receiving medical treatment. All three, who were previously known to police, have been charged with murder, interfering with a corpse, torture and deprivation of liberty. The accused murderers and Mr Barker were 'just acquaintances,' Superintendent Hutchinson said. 'We believe it was just drug related... but they had known each other for a reasonable period,' he said. The Gold Coast man is due to appear in Toowoomba Magistrates Court on Monday. The Cooloola Cove pair - father and son - are due to appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday. While Superintendent Hutchinson says no further arrests are expected, he hopes the recent arrests will prompt others with further insight into the incident to come forward. Police are also appealing for information about the location or movements of a white 1983 model 80 series Toyota Landcruiser station wagon, which at the time had a Queensland registration 817SBZ. It is believed this is the vehicle which transported Mr Barker from the petrol station to Cooloola Cove on December 11, 2013.

"Eligible: The number of claimants has soared to 3.2million, with 135,000 receiving the allowance for back pain . Tens of thousands of people have been awarded disability benefits for back pain. Others are claiming the cash for problems such as drug or alcohol abuse and asthma. The Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is supposed to help those who have difficulty walking or washing and dressing. But new figures released under Freedom of Information laws have revealed the benefit was paid to claimants with a surprising range of conditions. Last year the mobility component of the benefit, worth up to £55.25 a week, was handed out to 140,000 people suffering from back pain. There were 18,000 awards for alcohol and drug abuse, 25,000 for asthma and 1,500 for ‘frailty’. The care component of the benefit, which is worth up to £79.15 a week, was paid to 135,000 people with back pain. There were 21,000 awards last year for asthma, 19,000 for alcohol or drug abuse and nearly 1,000 for people suffering from ‘multiple allergy syndrome’. The number of claimants has already spiralled to 3.2million. And the amount of people claiming DLA is set to rise to 3.5million by 2015 – more than three times the 1.1million who received the benefit when it was created in 1992. This costs taxpayers £13.2billion a year, around the same amount as the entire budget of the Department for Transport. The Government’s plan to replace DLA with a new Personal Independence Payment has prompted angry complaints from medical charities and disability groups. But ministers say that, without reform, one in 17 people will be claiming the benefit by 2018. The latest in a series of radical changes to the welfare system will come into effect today. Most benefit payments are due to be increased by just 1 per cent – a figure below inflation – while DLA will begin to be replaced by PIP. Official figures suggest 71 per cent of those currently being paid DLA get the benefit ‘without systematic checks’. Often they are simply asked to hand . in a form assessing their capability which they have filled out . themselves. Now most claimants will be told to attend a compulsory . face-to-face assessment. Like . the DLA, PIP will be non-means tested, non-taxable and is paid to . people whether they are in or out of work. Initially, it will only apply . to new claimants but existing ones will gradually be reassessed. Paralympian and disability rights campaigner Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson has insisted the changes will hit vulnerable people. Differing opinions: Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson (right) said DLA is a lifeline for people with a wide range of conditions who need support. Esther McVey, (left) Minister for disabled people said the new benefit system will make sure the support is given to those who need it most . Reforms: Official figures suggest 71 per cent of those currently being paid DLA get the benefit 'without systematic checks'. A stricter system will crack down on people claiming for conditions including asthma . And Liz Sayce, Disability Rights UK Chief Executive, said: ‘Our members tell us they face an incomprehensible maze of benefits changes – the bedroom tax, housing benefit changes, changes to social care eligibility, and the introduction of PIP. ‘Social security is a springboard to participation. It is an investment in disabled people’s contribution to society. ‘Benefits provide a bit of support, like an adapted car or a travelling companion for someone with a learning disability. ‘They can make the difference between the person living for decades isolated and out of work or making a full contribution  to society.’ But disability minister Esther McVey insisted: ‘The Personal Independence Payment has been designed to better reflect today’s understanding of disability, particularly to update our thinking on mental health and fluctuating conditions. ‘We are introducing a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews – something missing in the current system. ‘This will ensure the billions we spend on the benefit give more targeted support to those who need it most.'","3.2 million people claiming Disability Living Allowance cost the taxpayer £13.2billion .
Drug and alcohol abuse and asthma are listed as reasons for claiming the benefit .

"A Pennsylvania mother and her boyfriend laughed as they tortured her three-year-old son for weeks by hanging him upside down and hitting him with a frying pan until he died, prosecutors have claimed. Jillian Tait, 31, and Gary Lee Fellenbaum, 23, were charged Thursday with murdering Tait's son, Scott McMillan in what a district attorney has referred to as 'an American horror story'. The pair from Chesco, Pennsylvania, are said to have gone car shopping, bought pizza, had sex and took a nap as Tait's unresponsive three-year-old son lay dying after weeks of relentless torture. The torment included being beaten with blunt objects, tied to a chair with electrical tape and several punches to the face and stomach. When his body was taken to the emergency room, nurses are said to have wept at the sight of his injuries. 'American horror story': Scott McMillan, three, was tortured for weeks and beaten with a frying pan until he eventually died, prosecutors in Pennsylvania have said . Arrested: Jillian Tait, 31, and Gary Lee Fellenbaum, 23, were charged Thursday with murdering Tait's son. Officials said they had sex and went to order pizza as the boy lay dying . They are accused of laughing as the boy was hung upside down and whipped, striking him repeatedly with a frying pan, and eventually beating him to death. Chester County District Attorney Thomas Hogan called the sickening accusations 'an American horror story.' The abuse had been going on for months, but the beatings and violence intensified between Sunday and Thursday last week. Announcing the charges, he said: 'Let me tell you about an American horror story. Little Scotty McMillan is dead. 'Over a three-day period… he was systematically tortured and beaten to death. He was punched in the face and in the stomach, he was scourged with a homemade whip, he was lashed with a metal rod, he was tied to a chair and beaten, he was tied upside down by his feet and beaten, his head was smashed through a wall and at the end of that he had bruises on top of bruises all over his body.' 'When his body went into the emergency room our ER nurses — who see a lot of terrible things — when they saw his body, they wept.' Holding back tears he said: 'Say a prayer for little Scott McMilan. The brief nightmare that was his life is over.' Pain: Prosecutors said Scott had gone through weeks of torment, but the torture intensified last week when the youngster refused to eat his breakfast . Hogan concluded that his team would be seeking the death penalty as the victim was under 12 and there are allegations he had been tortured. The couple met working at Wal-Mart and last month moved in together, along with Fellenbaum's estranged wife and three children — Tait's six and three-year-old sons and the Fellenbaums' 11-month-old daughter. The six lived in a mobile home park in West Caln Township, Chester County, about 35 miles northwest of Philadelphia. The three adults told authorities 'that Scott McMillan had been punched and beaten with blunt and sharp objects, whipped, taped to a chair with electrical tape and beaten, hung up by his feet and beaten, and suffered other acts of violence,' police said in affidavits released Thursday. Amber Fellenbaum, 21, was charged with child endangerment for allegedly failing to help the toddler. She ultimately called 911 Tuesday night, authorities said. By then, Scott had been unresponsive for hours, and had been put in a shower for more than 30 minutes by his mother and her boyfriend, investigators said. When the boy failed to awaken, they placed him on an uninflated air mattress and went out shopping, authorities said. Fellenbaum had severely beaten the boy for refusing to eat toast both Monday and Tuesday morning, authorities said. Scene: The pair were living in a trailer with Fellenbaum's estranged wife and three children — Tait's 6- and 3-year-old sons and the Fellenbaums' 11-month-old daughter . The 'discipline' included throwing him against a wall, knocking him off a chair with a punch and then taping him to the chair to keep him upright for more beatings, police said. It was not immediately clear if any of the adults have lawyers. Tait told police that she also took part in the abuse and saw the scars on her younger son, court documents said. Her older son also showed signs of abuse, authorities said. She and Fellenbaum are being held without bail after their arraignments Thursday. They are scheduled for a preliminary hearing on November 14. When authorities searched their home, they only had one picture of Scott. Prosecutors also showed off pictures of the weapons that were used. Included in the items were a makeshift whip, a curtain rod, an aluminum strip and photos of holes in the wall where Fellenbaum slammed Scotty and his 6-year-old brother's heads into the wall, according to NBC Philadelphia. On the night that the youngster died, Tait told police that she and Fellenbaum left Scotty on the mattress so he could sleep then went out to pick up pizza for dinner. At that time, Tait told police that she and Fellenbaum engaged in sexual activity then she took a nap, according to investigators. After waking up around 7:30 pm Tait said she found Scotty wasn't breathing so she screamed for someone to call 911. Amber Fellenbaum then called 911 and medics arrived. Horrific: The couple met working at Wal-Mart and last month moved in together, along with Fellenbaum's estranged wife and three children . A judge denied bail to both Fellenbaum and Tait at a Wednesday arraignment. Hogan announced a total of 16 charges against Gary Fellenbaum including first- and third-degree murder charges, homicide, endangering the welfare of a child, assault and reckless endangerment. Tait faces 15 charges including the most serious murder charges, according to court records. According to Chester County's Daily Local News, Fellenbaum picked on the younger boy because he didn't know what was happening and tried to resist. The older boy, who was six, tried not to irritate Fellenbaum any more by struggling. In a statement to investigators, Tait admitted that  she participated in the assaults on the brothers. An affidavit states: 'During one incident, Gary hung Scott and (his brother) up by their feet one at a time and beat the boys while they were hanging upside down'(Tait) stated the she and Gary were laughing during the incident.' Amber Fellenbaum, 21, Gary's estranged wife, was was charged with child endangerment for allegedly failing to help the toddler . Scott had been unable to eat the breakfast of toast and cinnamon sugar that Fellenbaum made for him and kept spitting it out. She said she and Fellenbaum tried to force the toast into his mouth but that he still would not eat. Fellenbaum, angry at the child, began punching him in the stomach and face, and took him to his room where the two continued punching him. At some point, she said, Fellenbaum picked the child up by his back and slammed him into a wall, according to the affidavit. On Tuesday, when the child woke up he had very red, swolen face. Again he didn't eat breakfast, so Fellenbaum said he was being disrespectful. He then punched him so hard that the boy fell off of his chair. Fellenbaum then put him back on the chair as he squirmed, took out some electrical tape and tied the boy's feet. He also strapped his arms to the posts of the chair so they were elevated. Fellenbaum began punching Scott again, causing him to vomit and become unresponsive, according to the police documents. The pair, according to the affadavit, then tried to wake the boy up. Failing to do so they allegedly put him in a bath of ice cold water and changed his closed. Fellenbaum is believed to have seen this as another sign of disrespect, so put the boy on the mattress and left the house to go and collect pizza. When they returned he will still unresponsive, so Tait said she ate some of the pizza then had sex with Fellenbaum. Hogan added that there had been no warning signs to suggest the boys were being abused. Scott was a student at Rainbow Elementary School, but staff members never reported suspicious bruises or injuries. However, Scott had been off of school for two weeks.

"A disabled Lottery winner says he wishes he had never won his £20,000 prize after his new-found wealth meant his benefits were cancelled. George Grant, 54, hoped go on a luxury holiday in Nashville, Tennessee after winning the five-figure sum on a National Lottery Lucky Dip ticket. But he says he is instead counting the cost after the windfall meant he no longer qualifies for income support, housing benefit, a council tax reduction or any other means-tested handouts. George Grant  wishes he had never won £20,000 on the lottery after some of his benefits were cancelled . Mr Grant, of Golspie in northern Scotland, is now deemed to have savings over the government's £16,000 limit and can only make what benefit bosses describe as 'reasonable expenditure'. He said: 'I wish I'd never won this money, the hassle it has caused me. I won't be buying a ticket again.' Mr Grant has been unable to work since he was left with mobility problems following a motorbike accident in October 1980, when he was just 21. He had previously earned a living as a youth leader and disc jockey but since the accident has been forced to live on benefits. He receives disability living allowance (DLA) as well as housing benefit and council tax benefit. Mr Grant said: 'That accident stopped everything in its tracks. I've been buying tickets since the lottery started in 1994 and have won £10 here and there but nothing major until now.' He purchased a Lucky Dip ticket from the Nisa store on Golspie's Main Street earlier this month and went back on Saturday to find out if he'd won anything. He said: 'I went into the shop and handed the ticket over. The machine made a funny noise and I thought it was another £10 win but the sales assistant said ""I think you've won a wee bit more than £10"". 'When he said that, I looked out the window for the pink elephants to fly.' Benefits rules mean that claimants cannot spend any windfall in order to become entitled to handouts again . It turned out that he had won £20,000 on the raffle, run as part of the Lucky Dip game. The Nisa store was unable to pay out the winnings and George had to go to another store where he was given a cheque. His immediate thoughts were that he would pay off debts he owes to relatives and possibly visit Nashville, a place he has always wanted to visit because of his love of music. Government rules state that anyone with savings over £16,000 is not entitled to means-tested benefits such as income support, housing benefit and council tax reduction. However, they can still receive benefits which are not means-tested, such as disability living allowance and incapacity benefit. A complicated formula is in place to calculate benefit entitlement for people with savings of between £6000 and £16,000, while anyone with savings under £6000 can receive benefits, if eligible. There are also rules in place to prevent anyone, such as Mr Grant, who comes into an inheritance or windfall, from spending it in order to  retain means-tested benefit. He has already been told that he will have to account for any expenditures he makes. He said: 'I thought how great it was to finally have some money and be debt-free. 'I've always wanted to go to Nashville. I've never been abroad and have only flown once and that was off the back of a motorbike. 'The furthest I've travelled has been to London. I was never meant to have any money.' Richard Gale, from Mr Grant's local Citizens' Advice Bureau (CAB) manager, said: 'This is a great win for George. 'The information that I have is that it is all a matter of what is considered to be ""reasonable expenditure"" and that requires a discussion between the benefit providers and the claimant. 'In this case that would be George, and the CAB would be happy to work with him, should he wish, to ensure that he complies with the benefit regulations and does not fall foul of any sanctions that may result from his windfall and to help him achieve his goals.'","Scotsman, 54, was left disabled by motorbike accident 30 years ago .

"A former Mr Wales falsely claimed £28,000 in benefits payments while competing in bodybuilding competitions has been jailed for six months. Peter Beddoe, 50, of Aberdare, claimed on his application that he was too weak to walk, but went to the gym almost every day in order to stay in peak physical condition for competitions. The court heard that his first claim was genuine when he was left wheelchair-bound after a fall. Scroll down for video . Bodybuilder: Peter Beddoe competed in a number of competitions while claiming Disability Living Allowance . Video courtesy of UK bodybuilding forum TMuscle.co.uk . But he continued to claim Disability Allowance, designed to assist those suffering from chronic illness and injuries, for seven years - while continuing to compete in national competitions. The amateur bodybuilder was receiving a higher rate of disability allowance meant for people who cannot walk, after claiming he needed a walking stick or crutches to get around. He twice won the title of Mr Wales in a senior bodybuilding competition that required him to attend the gym regularly and keep in peak physical condition. In August 2009 the amateur bodybuilder, who worked out at his local gym hundreds of times a year, filed a claim on the same day that he entered a competition. Claims: On one occasion, Beddoe submitted an application to claim Disability Allowance on the same day he was competing in a bodybuilding competition. He has been jailed for six months . In the application, Beddoe said: 'I need a frame to walk. I will injure myself without some form of support.' In August he was photographed showing off his body after winning the veterans section of the 'Kent Classic' event, in Gravesend, above . Jailing him today,  a judge at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court said: 'In my opinion this disgraceful series of offences harms the whole community.' Between 2008 and 2012 he won the National Amateur Bodybuilding Association (NABBA) Masters over 40s tournament in 2008 and 2012. In 2009 he came third in the Seniors Over 40 United Kingdom Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation (UKBFF) Welsh Championships. He came third again in the same section of the South Coast 2009 championships at the Guild Hall, in Portsmouth. As recently as August he was photographed showing off his body after winning the veterans section of the 'Kent Classic' event, in Gravesend. He was jailed after he admitted last month to two counts of making dishonest representations to obtain a benefit and one count of fraud. Stewart McLeese, prosecuting for the Department of Work and Pensions, said: 'An investigation discovered that Mr Beddoe was an amateur bodybuilder.' He said evidence was found that he had competed in competitions around the country and was a former senior Mr Wales winner. He added that Beddoe was claiming the DLA mobility allowance at the highest rate and the care element at the lowest rate. Lawrence Jones, defending, said Beddoe had legitimately claimed DLA at the outset when he had been wheelchair bound after a serious fall. His guilty plea was on the basis that he had begun claiming cash legitimately. Beddoe still suffered from a degenerative spinal problem and continued to go to the gym for health reasons, he said. Mr Jones said: 'He is still doing high level reistance training. He still goes to the gym to lift weights. He accepts that. 'He trains with weights twice a week and uses a steam room three times a week to relax his muscles.' Beddoe, who is already repaying the cash dishonestly claimed at a rate of £10 a week, was ordered to pay £535 in costs. He worked out at his local gym, DW Fitness 1,100 times in a five year period from mid 2008, the court heard .","Peter Beddoe claimed Disability Living Allowance between 2008 and 2013 .

"Sons and daughters grow up but they'll always be a baby to their devoted mothers. It's a touching sentiment but it can also cause friction between families when mothers can't let go of their beloved sons - particularly after they get married. It's a situation that Mel Fallowfield, a journalist who lives in London, knows only too well. She says her relationship with her mother-in-law, Irene Atterbury, is 'strained' because she frowns upon the way Mel 'looks after' her son, Brian. Appearing on today's This Morning, mother-of-two Mel, 41, explained: 'Irene is quite traditional so when she arrives and I'm working, she'll ask ""what's for supper"" and I'll say ""I don't know, there might be some eggs in the fridge"" or she'll see a pile of Brian's un-ironed shirts. She feels I don't look after him as well as I might.' Scroll down for video . Conflict: Mel Fallowfield, right, appeared on today's This Morning with her mother-in-law Irene Atterbury . Irene believes Mel should be acting like a perfect housewife, keeping the home clean for her son and having his dinner on the table when he comes home from his job as the head of client strategy for an IT company. But Mel thinks it's better if she also earns money. Mel said: 'I can understand she wants her son to be ""properly looked after"" but I think me bringing money into the family is more important that cleaning the skirting boards.' Irene admitted her and Mel's differing views stem from them coming from different generations - and possibly because she's from the North while her daughter-in-law is a Southerner. She confessed that she can be 'a bit outspoken' when telling Mel if she doesn't agree with the way she's doing things - from the care of her son and grandchildren to the housework. She can also be tactless at times, for example, asking Mel is she could wear black to her wedding to Brian and once even commenting on her daughter-in-law's figure. Generations apart: The pair have different views on a woman's role as a wife . Mel recalled: 'I put on weight with a thyroid problem and she said ""goodness you have put on weight haven't you?"" When I asked Brian to tell her not to comment about it, she said to me later, ""you're sensitive about your weight"".' Irene said she thinks it's better to voice her opinion - even if it causes offence - as she believes 'if you bottle it up, it gets worse.' She admitted wanting to wear black to her son's wedding could have been because 'deep down' she was mourning losing him to his wife. Mel said her husband doesn't get involved to resolve the differences between her and his mother. 'Brian has got fed up, he thinks ""you're too grown up women, sort it out"",' she said. Commenting on the situation this This Morning, relationship expert Dr Pam Spurr said tension between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law can be a 'serious issue' that needs to be resolved as it can cause the break up of a relationship. Family ties: Married presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford joked about their own family situation during the interview . She said: 'Interfering mother-in-laws need to stand back and realise they sound like that Harry Enfield character who no-one liked who always said ""you don't want to do that!""' The tricky relationship between wives and their husband's mother is one writer Katy Rink, from Shrewsbury, also knows well. She has written a book on the subject, 'Managing Your MIL: You and your mother-in-law, for better or for worse?' She previously told MailOnline that it's important for women at war to remember that they both have the same goal in mind - their husband/son's happiness. She told MailOnline of the mother-in-law-daughter-in-law dynamic: 'It's an important relationship and one you might have to put a lot of energy into getting right. 'It's one where both are programmed to be mutually suspicious of the other. She wants you to be up to the job of looking after your son and you feel under pressure and sometimes insecure as you adapt to a new role as a wife and mother.' For daughters-in-law like Mel feeling the strain, she has the following advice: 'Remember you can't change your mother-in-law but you can change the way you react. Don't prickle too readily or look for hidden messages.' Do you have a strained relationship with your mother-in-law or daughter-in-law?

"Father-of-five: Brian Falcus, 38, received £19,000 in disability handouts while working as an instructor sergeant for army cadets . A benefits cheat avoided jail despite being given £19,000 in disability handouts while working as an instructor sergeant for army cadets. Father-of-five Brian Falcus, 38, of North Shields, Tyne and Wear, was given government help after claiming he had restricted mobility and needed help with personal care. But he was involved in parades two nights per week, educational weekends and annual camps and courses with young recruits at the army cadet corps. Prosecutor Graeme O’Sullivan told Newcastle Crown Court that Falcus was paid disability living allowance from 2004 and employment support allowance from 2009. He added: ‘Evidence came to light that in August 2010 Mr Falcus had joined the army cadet corps as an instructor sergeant. He had been passed fit to do so on August 8, 2010.’ Mr O’Sullivan said the basis for Falcus’s award for benefits was ‘restricted mobility and help with personal care’. He added: ‘The prosecution case is, from 2010, his physical capability must have improved for him to be sufficiently fit.’ Mr O’Sullivan said the benefits would normally be given to wheelchair users, people with disabilities making it difficult for them to get around and those with illnesses that restrict their mobility. Falcus pleaded guilty to two charges of dishonestly failing to notify a change of circumstances. Mr O’Sullivan added: ‘He accepts during the period he ought to have notified the department of an improvement in his circumstances.’ The court heard the army fitness test which allowed Falcus to be sergeant, a voluntary post with just expenses paid, would not have been as rigorous as those taken by soldiers who would be deployed on the front line. Mr O’Sullivan said: ‘His work involved parading two nights per week, educational weekends, annual camp and various courses.’ Judge John Milford sentenced Falcus to 14 weeks in jail, suspended for two years, with a three-month curfew from 8pm to 7am. The judge told him: ‘You have pleaded guilty to benefit fraud which has cost the British taxpayer £19,000. Sentencing: Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) heard Falcus, of North Shields, Tyne and Wear, was paid disability living allowance from 2004 and employment support allowance from 2009 . ‘You were receiving two allowances, the most significant of which was disability living allowance and the other employment support allowance on the basis you were suffering from a significant disability, namely restricted mobility. ‘The fact of the matter is, for three years over the period of this fraudulent claim, you were fit enough to be a sergeant instructor in the cadets and had you informed the department, as you should have done of that, no doubt the allowances would not have been paid.’ Nicholas Lane, defending, said Falcus is the father of five children, two of whom have extra needs. Mr Lane said Falcus got involved with the cadets when his doctor advised him to be more active. He added: ‘We are not talking about a man assessed as fit to take up a role on the front line. This is a gentleman who, on the army cadet force health guidelines, is assessed as being able to take part in supervision and other activities for boys and girls.’","Father-of-five Brian Falcus, 38, of North Shields, received government help .

"David Cameron should ignore Tory backbenchers using the public ‘hysteria’ over immigration to drive Britain out of Europe, veteran MP Ken Clarke said this morning. The former Chancellor suggested the Prime Minister should let right wing MPs defect to Ukip so the party could get back to ‘common sense’. He said: ‘We mustn’t compete with ignorance and bigotry,’ Mr Clarke’s remarks come amid growing demands for the PM to demand a cap on the number of EU migrants allowed to move to the UK. Veteran Conservative MP Ken Clarke said David Cameron needed to 'ignore' the right wing of his party . The Prime Minister yesterday vowed to ‘fix’ Brussels’ free movement rules which give migrants the right to work anywhere in the EU. He also hit back at European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso, who declared on a visit to London that curbs on migrants from the Continent would be 'illegal'. Mr Barosso yesterday claimed former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would not have ‘surrendered to the arguments of Ukip’. He said: ""It would be impossible to hear Ukip speech coming from Margaret Thatcher, completely impossible. ‘What I remember about Margaret Thatcher, she was for enlargement and for fighting protectionism. I don't remember her defending labour market protectionism. On the contrary she was for opening markets. From what I remember of Thatcher she would not be surrendering to these arguments."" Mr Clarke this morning appeared to back the outgoing EU commission president’s remarks. He said there were ‘a section of the population that are just bigoted’. David Cameron said the public concern over immigration was 'reasonable' and vowed to 'fix' Brussels free movement rules . European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said Margaret Thatcher would never have 'surrendered' to Ukip arguments . He said there was ‘no point in putting some kind of arbitrary figure’ on the number of migrants coming in from Europe. Instead, he said: ‘What we need is strong, sensible governments. We must get back to some common sense. ‘We’ve had a wave of almost hysteria. I’ve seen waves of hysteria decades ago. But in the modern world we’ve got to get used to the fact that we need an international workforce. ‘’Ignore the daft ambitions of people whose main interest is just getting Britain out of Europe.’ ""Ignore those with daft ambitions, let's look after Britain in the modern world."" Speaking yesterday Mr Cameron said British voters - not the head of the European Commission - were 'the boss', insisting reform of the right to free movement would be central to demands for a looser relationship with Brussels if he wins the next election. Senior Tories believe he will wait until after the Rochester by-election at the end of next month to set out his plans. Nigel Farage claims the Prime Minister will not be able to place curbs on European immigration . Cabinet ministers are examining the idea of an 'emergency brake' which could be applied to limit numbers if migration exceeded forecasts. Yesterday there were claims ministers also want to draw on current practice in Croatia, the latest country to join the EU. British workers wanting to live and work there for more than three months need a work permit, only issued with proof of accommodation, financial means of support, health insurance and a criminal background check. Mr Cameron said: 'What we need in Britain is a renegotiation of our relationship with the European Union and a referendum where the British people decide whether to stay in this reformed organisa-tion or do we leave it. 'Now that's what I will pursue, that's what I will deliver and at the heart of that renegotiation we need to address people's concerns about immigration. ‘I'm very clear about who the boss is, about who I answer to and it is the British people. They want this, they're not being unreasonable about it. I will fix it.' The Government has issued more national insurance numbers to workers from Spain, Romania, Greece and Italy than anywhere else over the last six years, according to official government figures . Dspite the increase in immigration, unemployment is falling. Ministers claimed this was because their 'long term economic plan' is starting to work - with more than half a millions people finding work last year . But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Mr Barroso was right to warn we would be marginalised on the world stage if Britain quits the EU. He said: 'Do you really think people in Beijing, Washington, Tokyo are going to take Britain seriously in the future if we don't stand tall in Brussels, Berlin and Paris? 'I just think bobbing around rather hopelessly in the mid-Atlantic, and having lots of major foreign investors pulling out of this country jeopardising millions of jobs...I don't think is a way of making this country stronger and safer and more prosperous in the future.'","Former Chancellor said Eurosceptic Tories should leave  for Ukip .

"Susan Barringer, 56, (pictured outside Sheffield Crown Court) continued to claim more than £20,000 in disability living allowance after moving to  Spain . A benefits cheat who has claimed more than £20,000 in disability allowance despite moving to the sun-soaked Costa del Sol ten years ago has escaped jail. Susan Barringer, originally of Waterthorpe, Sheffield, failed to tell the authorities she had moved abroad in 2004 and instead continued to claim benefits while living in a mobile home in Spain. The 56-year-old, who appeared at Sheffield Crown Court in a mobility scooter, admitted failing to notify the authorities of a change in her circumstances but was spared jail by the judge who said she had 'told deliberate lies'. Patrick Palmer, prosecuting, told the court that Barringer began claiming disability living allowance in 2001 because she was 'almost unable to walk'. However, he said an investigation was launched after her bank accounts showed she had been spending money abroad. She was also found to be using a mobile phone in Malaga, southern Spain. Mr Palmer said that when Barringer began to claim benefits she had to sign a form which stated she would inform the authorities if she was abroad for more than four weeks. However, Barringer claimed she was unaware she had to inform the authorities that she was not in the country. Mr Palmer said she was living in a mobile home on the Costa del Sol which she bought in 2004 for between £10,000 and £15,000 after inheriting approximately £30,000 from her ex-husband. The court heard that after she move abroad, Barringer claimed a total of £20,097 to which she was not entitled. David Webster, defending, said she was a hard-working woman who was caring for her elderly mother. However, he added: 'The excursions to Spain are over.' Susan Barringer, 56, failed to tell authorities she had moved abroad  and continued to claim £20,000 in benefits while living in Spain. She arrived at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) in a mobility scooter but was spared jail . Barringer moved to a mobile home on the sun-soaked Costa del Sol in southern Spain (above) in 2004 . Judge Recorder Ray Singh handed Barringer a 12-week jail term, suspended for 18 months, and made her the subject of a curfew from 9pm to 6am every night . He told her: 'You were not, in essence, living in this jurisdiction since 2004.You were no doubt fully aware you must notify a change in circumstances whether or not you were resident in the UK. 'You clearly chose to ignore that by not reporting these changes. When interviewed you told deliberate lies to the officer investigating.'","Susan Barringer claimed disability living allowance after moving to Spain .

"A couple who claimed they were too ill to cook their own meals were actually running a cafe while illegally pocketing £135,000 in benefits. Caroline Banks and Karl Bradsell both worked at Riscatti's Cafe in Bury, despite claiming they could not cook for themselves and that one of them struggled to walk. The pair pleaded guilty to 24 charges of fraud, with Banks, of Hills Court, Bury, jailed for 16 months and Bradsell, of Chaffinch Drive, Bury, for 19 months. Scroll down for video . Caroline Banks and Karl Bradsell both worked at Riscatti's Cafe in Bury, despite claiming they could not cook for themselves . After a tip-off, council officers and the Department for Work and Pensions launched an investigation, catching the couple out using CCTV and secretly-recorded footage. The pair, who are no longer together, amassed a total of £135,000 over five years of deceitful benefits claims. They both claimed that they could not cook - but in reality the pair ran a cafe and Bradsell used a mobility car to deliver Chinese takeaways. Peter Cadwallader, prosecuting, told Bolton Crown Court that Banks, 42, said she was unable to walk unaided, needed a wheelchair and required help using the toilet. She claimed to have a long list of illnesses, including a slipped disc in her back, angina and depression. Her home was adapted with a stairlift and a wet room while she was claiming Disability Living Allowance, Employment Support and Housing Benefit, among others. She also had a mobility car so friends and family could drive her around. But Banks, who sobbed throughout the hearing, was filmed working long days on her feet, lifting tables and chairs and serving customers at the cafe. On one occasion, she was even spotted wearing high heels. Defending Banks, Stuart Duke said her initial benefit claims had been legitimate, but that the situation spiralled into 'dishonesty and deceit'. Sentencing at Bolton Crown Court, Judge Elliot Knopf said the pair's crimes were a 'slap in the face to the taxpayer' and those 'genuinely and honestly entitled to benefits' (file picture) She was overpaid £62,000 and will pay back the cash from her benefits. Mr Duke said: 'Ironically, since these offences came to light, both her physical and mental health have deteriorated. She has fallen into abject poverty and is unable to walk.' Bradsell, also 42, said he rented the council house next door to Banks and was single, but in reality he lived with Banks in her adapted home while he sub-let his house to his brother. When questioned in 2012, he claimed to suffer from epilepsy and depression and said he hadn't worked in seven years. Bradsell said his condition was so bad that he had fits every couple of days and suffered panic attacks, often wetting himself. He said he couldn't drive because of his epilepsy and that he used a microwave because he was afraid of using the cooker. But he was filmed driving Banks' mobility car to and from the cafe, where he cooked and cleaned, and even used the vehicle to deliver food for a Chinese takeaway at night. Defending Bradsell, Michael Lea said he accepted he had exaggerated his condition when claiming benefits. Bradsell now has a job helping older people and is paying back around £140 a week out of his wages to refund the £73,000 he fraudulently claimed. Sentencing, Judge Elliot Knopf said the pair's crimes were a 'slap in the face to the taxpayer' and those 'genuinely and honestly entitled to benefits'. He added: 'You put your heads together and agreed to consciously, deliberately and persistently defraud the system. You painted a completely and utterly false picture of your conditions - you knew the buttons to press.' After the hearing, Bury councillor Sandra Walmsley said: 'This was a deliberate and breathtaking act of fraud, carried out over a long time and involving huge sums of money. 'Thanks to the determined efforts of our investigators, Bradsell and Banks have finally been brought to justice.'","Caroline Banks and Karl Bradsell jailed for five-year benefits scam .

"A senior politician has told how Rolf Harris groped her when she was a young radio reporter preparing to interview the now disgraced entertainer during the 1980s. New Zealand MP Maggie Barry said she was in her mid-20s and working at a regional radio station when she had to interview the star, who was touring the country at the time. Ms Barry spoke out about her encounter with Harris as he faced a jail sentence today, after he was convicted on Monday of a string of sex assaults on girls between 1968 and 1986. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: New Zealand MP Maggie Barry (right) has told how Rolf Harris (left) groped her when she was a young radio reporter preparing to interview the now disgraced entertainer . He said she had expected a light-hearted encounter with Harris, only to have to angrily rebuke him when the artist, now 84, put his hand on her leg. 'In the pre-record situation, when you're testing the . microphones and all the rest of it, he suddenly started with the . wandering hands and groping,' she told Radio New Zealand. 'When he put his hand on my leg I said ""you can stop that right now"" and I stood up and said ""you're a sleazy creep"". 'At that point he got a bit nasty and the publicist came in and smoothed things over.' Ms Barry, now aged in her 50s, said that after she called out Harris over his behaviour he 'began to . cut up rough (became angry) and protest and called me a couple of names' before the publicist intervened and he apologised. Interview: Ms Barry said she was in her mid-20s and working at a regional radio station in the 1980s when she had to interview the star, who was touring the country at the time . Barry said she . never reported the incident because it was 'on the absolute minor end of . the scale' of the abuses committed by Harris, and she had largely . forgotten about it until his trial began. However, she said the incident showed how . Harris thought he could act with impunity because of his fame, and that the . situation could have been far more serious if he had molested someone . who was younger or more vulnerable and not willing to stand up to him. 'It seemed that he was pretty confident and arrogant if he thought he could try it on with someone like me,' she said. 'When you look back with hindsight, seems that even 30 years ago he had been getting away with a lot.' Mugshot: The shamed star was found guilty of 12 counts at London's Southwark Crown Court on Monday . Harris is due to be sentenced later today, and faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in jail. The shamed star was found guilty of 12 counts at London's Southwark Crown Court on Monday in unanimous verdicts by a jury of six men and six women. Harris from Bray in Berkshire, was convicted of nine assaults between 1968 and 1985 - one on a girl aged seven or eight, and the rest on teenagers between 14 and 19. The law at the time put the punishment at a maximum of two years, or five years for victims under 13. The remaining three guilty verdicts were for three counts of indecent assault on Tonya Lee, who has waived her right to anonymity, in 1986 when she was 15, when the maximum penalty had changed to 10 years. Mr Justice Sweeney will have to pass a sentence taking into account all the offending, and may consider Harris's old age. On Monday he warned the musician's legal team that he is likely to face prison. 'In reality, given the conviction on all 12 counts, it is inevitable that the type of sentence that is uppermost in the court's mind is a custodial sentence and he must understand that,' Mr Justice Sweeney had said. The once-loved entertainer was finally exposed as a serial sex offender at the end of his trial on Monday, his hypocrisy brought into sharp relief by the fact he had funded and starred in an educational film warning children of the dangers of paedophiles. Police are now looking into dozens more claims from alleged victims in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The charges Harris was convicted of concern one woman who was groped when she was just seven or eight and asked for his autograph, another two who fell prey as teenagers, and a catalogue of abuse against his daughter Bindi's then best friend. Facing jail: Rolf Harris, seen leaving Southwark Crown Court on Monday, could spend the rest of his life in jail . During the trial, the court also heard from six other women who claim they were groped by Harris while abroad, including one who told the jury the artist forced his tongue in her mouth when she was 11 or 12. She was off sick from school at a family friend's house in Australia in 1969, when Harris told her: 'I want to be the first person to introduce you to a tongue kiss', before he pounced. Prosecutors also tried to use evidence from another seven women with similar accounts, including a celebrity who said she was groped on live TV, but this was deemed inadmissible. Since his conviction, Harris, who has been stripped of his Bafta fellowship and faces losing his CBE, has also lost an honorary degree from the University of East London. Questions have been raised over the future of his artwork, which includes a portrait of the Queen, and authorities in his native Western Australia are planning to remove tributes. His multimillion-pound fortune could also be badly dented by legal costs and compensation claims.","Maggie Berry said Harris touched her leg as she prepared to interview him .

"Since a shopper posted a picture of a Target checkout worker online - the teen known as 'Alex from Target' has become a global internet sensation. The image went viral after it was posted online on November 2 and following a huge campaign on social media, he has been identified as Alexander Christopher LaBoeuf from Frisco, Texas. He attends Heritage High School in the city. His Twitter account has nearly half a million followers but the growth of his female fan base has left one user unhappy - his girlfriend.

Viral superstar: Alex is the latest web sensation and has nearly half a million Twitter followers . Concerned: At one point, the schoolgirl said: 'This is kinda [sic] scaring me', but thanked everyone who had supported her . Teen sensation: Alex is coming to terms with his new found fame . Lindsey Diers received a huge number of messages from fans - however she has quickly grown frustrated at the attention. At first she congratulated Alex for being famous, watching as huge numbers of mock adverts and memes were posted with his face on it. But when people began to find her online, she started to receive hurtful messages - some of which were death threats. Many said she could now 'never break up with him', but others supported and even congratulated her. At one point she said: 'This is kinda [sic] scaring me now.' A day after the image was posted online, she added: 'Thanks to everyone who has supported me through this, it means a lot.' Target also jumped on the bandwagon commenting on their unofficial mascot: 'We heart Alex too' with the hashtag #alexfromtarget. The store's official mascot is a bull terrier named Bullseye. Target told MailOnline today that the campaign was not created by the retailer. A statement read: 'Usually our new weekly ad is what gets people tweeting on Sundays. So imagine our surprise yesterday when one of our Target team members managed to flood the internet with images of red and khaki without even trying. 'We are proud to have a great team, including #AlexFromTarget, and are in contact with his store and family.' Target asked that Alex's privacy be respected until he decides to comment. The shop assistant has even attracted attention from talk show host Ellen DeGeneres who tweeted: 'Hey, #AlexFromTarget, it's #EllenFromEllen.' She then quipped: 'I just got an #AlexFromTarget tattoo.' In the past 24hours, #alexfromtarget, has received 554,759 mentions on Twitter, according to Twitter analytics site, Topsy. 'Am i famous now?' Alex posted on Twitter on Sunday, but the answer was already clear. 'Already fake accounts of me...Now i have to change my number.' After the media storm he simply posted: 'You guys are amazing... good night.' What seems clear, though, is that Alex is indeed just a normal teen, who goes by @acl163 on Twitter.

"A Wisconsin woman whose high speed drunk driving left her two friends dead and injured another in 2012 was sentenced Tuesday to seven years in prison. Ashley Baumann, 26, spoke publicly at the seven hour sentencing hearing for the first time since her crazed driving killed Jessica Hartwig, 33, and Misty Glisch, 31, and seriously injured Jerrica Woller. 'I am not the monster the media has made me out to be,' she told Lincoln County Circuit Judge Jay Tlusty. 'I wish I had the answers to the questions about what happened that night, but I don't, and I'm sorry for that.' Sentenced: Ashley Baumann was sentenced today (left) to seven years in prison after drunkenly killing her two friends while driving recklessly in June 2012 (mug shot at right) The sentence was around half the jail time prosecutors had asked for. That prosecutor, Tara Jenswold, wanted Baumann to get 14 years plus 10 years probation thereafter. Jenswold pointed to what she called Baumann's lack of remorse and refusal to accept responsibility for the crash which experts revealed happened at well over 90MPH, reports the Wausau Daily Herald. Played at the trial were damning recordings made of conversations Baumann had while in the Lincoln County Jail. Baumann actually ridicules Woller, who very nearly died in the crash. 'I hate her,' Baumann is heard to say. it was reported that just before the crash Woller warned Baumann to stop her reckless driving mere moments before the crash. Gone: Baumann's recklessness killed Jessica Hartwig, 33, (left) and Misty Glisch, 31 (right) Horrific: Baumann was driving in excess of 90MPH when she lost control and her car spun out in this field in June 2012 . 'I hate her': Jerrica Woller was seriously injured in the crash that left her two friends dead and later slandered by Baumann. She asked Baumann to stop her reckless behavior moments before the crash . Baumann's defense attorney Wright Laufenberg argued his client 'has always felt horrible about what happened.' Despite that, the judge chose not to hand Baumann the sentence prosecutors wanted. 'Clearly this is a tragedy,' Tlusty said. 'It has affected so many people both young and old...There are no winners. The legal system cannot undo what has occurred.' The judge also referenced Baumann's drinking. 'Significant to the court is that alcohol was involved,' he said as he noted her history of alcohol abuse. Baumann's blood alcohol level after the crash was measured at twice the legal limit. A jury convicted Baumann in May on all seven counts against her, including two counts of homicide while operating a vehicle under the influence and one count of injury by intoxicated use of a vehicle.","Ashley Baumann, 26, insisted she's the victim of media bias as she spoke publicly Tuesday in a Wisconsin court .

"Historian Baron John Acton famously declared that 'power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' Now, more than a century after Acton's accusation, scientists have shown that even the most noble lose sight of their values when handed the right to govern. A series of experiments found that once honest people had tasted power, they couldn't resist rewarding themselves at the expense of others. In a game, volunteers were given control over pay outs to themselves and their followers. Researchers found that once they tasted power, they couldn't resist rewarding themselves at the expense of others . After undergoing psychological testing to measure individual differences, including honesty, the volunteers played the 'dictator game'. In the game, they were given complete control over deciding pay outs to themselves and their followers. The leaders had the choice of making pro or anti-social decisions - the latter resulting in awarding less money to the group but more to the leader's own earnings. The findings showed those rated as less honest at first exhibited more corrupt behaviour. The findings showed those rated as less honest at first exhibited more corrupt behaviour. Over time, even those who initially scored high on honesty scales were not shielded from the corruptive effects of power . But, over time, even those who initially scored high on honesty scales were not shielded from the corruptive effects of power. The feeling of power has been found to have a similar effect on the brain to cocaine. It increases the levels of testosterone and its by-product 3-androstanediol in both men and women. This in turn leads to raised levels of dopamine, the brain's reward system called the nucleus accumbens, which can be very addictive. Like cocaine, scientists now believe power can lead to too much dopamine causing more negative effects such as arrogance and impatience. 'One thing that angers me, my children and most people across the world is why do powerful leaders not do more good?' said Professor John Antonakis from the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. 'Is it because of power? Do we really have to worry about this force? Is what Acton said really true? 'Corrupt individuals exhibit moral deterioration by using their power to benefit themselves and, by doing so, cause harm to the greater good. 'Powerful individuals are able to impose their decisions and preferences on weaker individuals.' In the study, the leader was given a pot of money and allowed to divide it how they liked. The more they took out for themselves, the less was left for their followers. 'The results were clear. Power corrupts. When given more followers and more choices, the leader was more likely to make an anti social decision,' Professor Antonakis said. Historian Baron John Acton (right) famously declared that 'power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' More than a century after Acton's accusation, scientists have shown that even the most noble lose sight of their values when handed the right to govern . 'In a way, power is to leaders what taste is to vampires. Once they get a taste of it, they cannot let go. The more followers they had, the more corrupt they became.' The participants were also given saliva tests which showed anti-social decisions were highest among those with the highest levels of testosterone, the male sex hormone. 'What we observed was real corruption using real stakes. For instance, some participants walked out of the lab with about $100 (£60) in payouts,' Professor Antonakis said. 'They knew if they profited they would harm the public good.' 'We think strong governance mechanisms and strong institutions are the key to keeping leaders in check,' he added. 'Organisations should limit how much leaders can drink from the seductive chalice of power.'","Scientists in Switzerland asked volunteers to play the 'dictator game'

"Police officers pepper sprayed a black teenager in his white foster parents' home after they mistook him for a burglar, authorities have said. Cops responded to the home in Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina after a neighbor saw 18-year-old DeShawn Currie entering his family's home through an unlocked side door. The teenager, who moved in with the Tyler family a year ago, said he was stunned when three police officers entered the home and demanded to know who he was. 'They was like, ""Put your hands on the door"",' DeShawn told WTVD. 'I was like, ""For what? This is my house."" I was like, ""Why are y'all in here?""' Scroll down for video . Hurt: DeShawn Currie, 18, said police officers profiled him when they thought he was a burglar in his white foster parents' house. He said he became angry when they told him he wasn't part of the family . The police officers demanded his ID - which showed a different address - and refused to believe he was part of the family because he was not in any of the pictures on the mantelpiece in the home. Police said they used pepper spray on the teenager when he 'became profane, threatening and belligerent' and 'refused to follow instructions' from officers. Stacy Tyler, DeShawn's foster mother, arrived back home to find the police officers there and told them that the teenager was her foster son. Mrs Tyler and her husband, Ricky Tyler, have three other young children. 'He's my baby boy just as much as my other three children are,' Stacy told WTVD of DeShawn. Saddened: His foster parents, Ricky and Stacy Tyler, said they thought of DeShawn as their own son . Part of the family: Cops demanded to know why DeShawn, who joined the family last year, was not in any photos on the mantelpiece if he claimed to be part of the family. It caused him to get angry, he said . The family moved into their new home in July and don't know all their neighbors, the Tylers said. But they were hurt that someone had assumed DeShawn was up to no good - and the teenager said the incident had made him feel less comfortable. 'I had moved into my room, and I'm feeling like I'm loved,' he said. 'Then when they come in and they just profile me and say that I'm not who I am - and that I do not stay here because there was white kids on the wall. That really made me mad.'

A police spokeswoman did not respond when asked specifically about what instructions Currie did not follow. Police also have not said how many officers entered the home, their length of service with the department or their race. Currie was treated by medical personnel at the scene, police said.

'I knew I couldn't do both, it was too draining,' Ms Joyce told Daily Mail Australia. 'I got my ex-husband involved and we decided our son Kane would live with him while I was over there and when I returned on leave I would have made enough money to be a stay-at-home mum.' Ms Joyce, who carried out four different rotations in Iraq from 2004 to 2006, said she prepared for the worst when it came time to say goodbye to a then five-year-old Kane.

"Chaos: Rising numbers of blood donors are being turned away due to bureaucratic errors . Soaring numbers of blood donors are being turned away without any medical reason - but because of chaos at clinics. The number of donors being being sent home as a result of an inefficient system has risen by 40 per cent compared with two years ago, which equates to one in 80 patients - or tens of thousands every year. While 10 per cent of donors are turned away for medical reasons, such as anaemia, recent piercings or infections, a further 10 per cent do not donate because of problems with the running of a clinic. The figures include people who are told . that they can no longer be fitted in because of late-running sessions, . sick staff and other problems, as well as those who have to wait so long . that they give up and go home, The Times reports. Long waits to donate mean that many frustrated donors leave before giving blood. It's estimated that only 4 per cent of people in the UK regularly give blood. The problem now means that on average, one donor at every donation session is lost to bad management. Blood donation bosses say part of the reason for growing inefficiencies is because costs have had to be cut to reduce the price of blood to the NHS. But transplant experts have warned that public faith in the blood donation system will be eroded if the current situation continues. According to figures from NHS Blood and Transplant, 24,014 people arrived at . donation sessions last year but could not give blood to due admin or bureaucratic reasons - compared with 19,239 two years earlier. Jon Latham, assistant director of marketing at the agency, told the newspaper the  very nature of blood donation walk in centres meant that there would sometimes be a wait. 'If you walked in to a doctors’ surgery, then you wouldn’t expect to be seen straight away. But that causes friction,' he said. Crisis: Blood donation bosses say part of the reason for growing inefficiencies is because costs have had to be cut to reduce the price of blood to the NHS . 'We know people can get frustrated and I really sympathise. [But] I don’t think there’s any other way we can do it. We do all we can to mitigate it but there probably isn’t a better system.' But James Munro, chief executive of Patient Opinion, said it was 'surprising' that 10 per cent of donors could not do so for non-medical reasons. he said: 'Blood donation... embodies the relationship we have with the NHS; we all put in and we all benefit. When it goes wrong . . . it undermines that essential public trust.' He added that if donors don't feel appreciated, they won't turn up. Defending the situation, NHS Blood and Transplant said the problem may have been over-estimated, with the rejected donor forms being counted incorrectly.","Donors being sent .

"A 63-year-old grandmother has told how going to give blood at her local healthcentre saved her life. Jan Grasham, who lives in the New Forest, was diagnosed with bowel cancer after discovering that she was anaemic when she went to donate blood. Ms Grasham had no other symptoms and strongly believes that the routine trip saved her life. Jan Grasham (centre, at the 2010 Race for Life) was diagnosed with bowel cancer after she went to give blood. While donating blood she learned that she was anaemic and was referred to her GP . She told MailOnline: ‘Giving blood turned out to be like an MOT. If I hadn’t gone I might not be here now. I am so thankful I went.’ She added: 'I feel so lucky that giving blood was something that I did regularly. 'I think it would have been quite a while before it was picked up otherwise as I didn't get have any symptoms that would have sent me to the doctor.' Ms Grasham went to give her 57th blood donation in August 2007 and was told that she was not eligible as her blood iron levels were too low. She said that initially she was not concerned about her health when nurses told her she was anaemic because she had suffered several episodes in the past. Ms Grasham (pictured with her  granddaughter, Mia) underwent surgery and chemotherapy at Southampton General Hospital. She believes that giving blood saved her life as she had no symptoms of the cancer . However, the nurses told her that her iron levels were sufficiently low that she should see her GP. Ms Grasham said: ‘I went to give blood – I was a regular donor and was going to give my 57th pint. ‘I had the pinprick test and it showed up a problem. They sent it away for further tests, but I was not allowed to give blood that day, so I was a bit miffed. I had never been turned away before.’ Her doctor carried out extensive tests and within two months she had been diagnosed with bowel cancer. She said: 'When I saw the consultant it was quite a shock. My first concern was how I would tell my children. Ms Grasham (front left at a school reunion) was given the all clear after her treatment for bowel cancer but four years later, a routine scan revealed a tumour on her kidney and she had to have further surgery . 'It was all a bit surreal.' Bowel cancer can cause anaemia . because it can result in bleeding into the bowel which depletes the . body’s supply of red blood cells. Other . symptoms of bowel cancer include blood in the stools, abdominal pain, a . change in bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss. Ms Grasham underwent surgery and chemotherapy at Southampton General Hospital. Following the six months treatment she was told that there were no longer any signs of the cancer in her bowel. Just as Ms Grasham began chemotherapy, her son, 29-year-old Jonathan Grasham (pictured with his daughter, Bella), a Royal Marine Commando, was sent on his second six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan . However, . Ms Grasham says that it was a hard time as just as she began . chemotherapy her son, 29-year-old Jonathan Grasham, a Royal Marine . Commando, was sent on his second six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan. Ms Grasham said: ‘It was a very hard time for the family, but thankfully he returned home safely. ‘I did not realise how debilitated I had felt until after I had finished the chemo.’ In 2009, just as Ms Grasham thought that everything was returning to normal, her daughter Lucy Coggin, 40, collapsed. Ms Coggin, who also lives in the New Forest, collapsed after finishing a workout and found that she was unable to speak. She was rushed to hospital whether she underwent four months of treatment and rehabilitation. Between Ms Grasham's cancer diagnoses, her daughter Lucy Coggin (pictured with her children, Mia and Lauren) collapsed and was diagnosed with MS. She now has no feeling in the right side of her body . After . months of tests, the mother of two young children was diagnosed with . multiple sclerosis – a disease which affects the nerves in the brain and . spine. Ms Grasham said: ‘Normally MS comes on gradually so people initially thought that she was just very stressed. ‘She had to learn to speak again and it was very strange because at first she had a Polish accent. ‘She still has no feeling in her right hand side but she can get about using a mobility scooter.’ However, this was still not the end of the family’s difficulties. Four years after her initial cancer diagnosis, a routine scan picked up a tumour in Ms Grasham’s kidney. Ms Grasham told MailOnline: 'It's all a bit surreal. Until you talk about it you don't realise what has happened in such a short amount of time.' Image shows her daughter, Lucy Coggin . Ms Grasham said: ‘It was another primary tumour so it was a bit like lightening striking twice in the same place.’ This time the tumour was contained within her kidney, so she had surgery but did not require any more chemotherapy. Ms Grasham has now been signed off by the bowel clinic but still has to have annual scans to check for kidney tumours. She said that she is now very hopeful about the future. She told MailOnline: ‘It’s all a bit surreal. Until you talk about it you don’t realise what has happened in such a short amount of time.’ To find out about Cancer Research UK’s campaign encouraging people across the UK to take one million actions to ‘Beat Cancer Sooner’, visit cruk.org/1millionactions . Mrs Grasham is not the only person to have benefited from giving blood. Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association has shown that donating blood reduces a person's risk of heart attacks, and of cancer. Research carried out by the University of California, in San Diego, also revealed that giving blood burns 650 calories per pint. It is believed that these benefits all arise from the fact that giving blood temporarily reduces a person's blood iron levels. Iron affects how thick and sticky the blood is. High iron levels cause the blood to be thicker. Raised iron levels also accelerate the oxidisation process of cholesterol. This can affect blood consistency and create increased friction as it travels through blood vessels. As this increases wear and tear to the lining of arteries it could then contribute to cardiovascular disease. Because donating blood removes some of its iron content, it may have a protective benefit if done on a consistent basis. A study published in the Journal of the National cancer Institute also links iron to an increased cancer risk as it’s believed to increase free-radical damage in the body. In line with this theory, a four-and-a-half-year study involving 1,200 people found those who made bi-annual blood donations had a lower incidence of cancer and mortality than those who didn’t. However, these benefits depend on making donations on a regular basis.","Jan Grasham was referred to GP after her iron level was found to be low .

"From silvery sardine skins to colourful peacock feathers, nature is full of surfaces that dazzle brighter than anything humans can create. Now British researchers have revealed that there is a 'universal explanation' behind the amazing colours in the natural world. They claim that the same microscopic layers of crystals are responsible for the reflective scales of fish as they are for iridescent colours on butterfly wings. Scientists at Bristol Univesrity claim that the same microscopic layers of crystals are responsible for the reflective scales of fish as they are for iridescent colours on butterfly wings . According to a report by Victoria Gill in the BBC, the world's creatures have evolved tiny structures that make use of light better than  man-made structure. Researchers at Bristol University claim that the process in nature could be copied by humans to create, for instance, LEDs that are more efficient. 'What's important is that the crystals have a range of different thicknesses,' Dr Tom Jordan, a member of the research team, told the BBC. Varying levels of these nanoscale crystals can be found in creatures such as beetles, butterflies and sardines, all of which produce an effect known as Anderson localisation. Varying levels of these nanoscale crystals can be found in creatures such as beetles, butterflies and sardines, all of which produce an effect known as Anderson localisation. Pictured is a leaf beetle . This refers to a physical phenomenon in which light waves are prevented from passing straight through a material . In 1958, Philip Anderson published an article in which he discussed the behaviour of electrons in a dirty crystal. He claimed light cannot spread in a straight line in a cloudy medium because the many layers of crystal divert the light as defects. If the disorder - the concentration of defects - exceeds a certain level, the waves are no longer able to spread in a cloudy medium at all. Varying levels of these nanoscale crystals can be found in creatures such as beetles, butterflies and sardines, all of which produce an effect known as Anderson localisation. As the light  goes in and meets these changes in the different layers, the multiple waves all interfere with each other. The light moves around inside the layers and is reflected back out, producing a colourful metallic effect. 'As the light [wave] goes in and meets these changes in the different layers, the multiple waves all interfere with each other,' lead scientist on the study, Dr Nicholas Roberts told the BBC. The light moves around inside the layers and is reflected back out, producing a colourful metallic effect. In an earlier study on this same topic, Dr Roberts said fish may have evolved this multilayer structure to help conceal them from predators. 'These fish have found a way to maximise their reflectivity over all angles they are viewed from,' he said. 'This helps the fish best match the light environment of the open ocean, making them less likely to be seen.' As a result of this ability, the skin of silvery fish or the colours in a peacock feather could hold the key to better optical devices. Many modern day optical devices such as LED lights and low loss optical fibres use these non-polarising types of reflectors to improve efficiency, explained Dr Jordan. 'However, these man-made reflectors currently require the use of materials with specific optical properties that are not always ideal,' he added. The mechanism that has evolved in fish overcomes this current design limitation and provides a new way to manufacture energy efficient lights. Silvery sardine (right) skins and colourful peacock features (left) could help engineers develop better LEDs .","Tiny crystal layers create iridescent surfaces in fish, butterflies and beetles .

"A motorist who killed a university student after losing control of his car when he suffered a seizure at the wheel may have been suffering from alcohol withdrawal, an inquest heard. Ian King, 56, lost control of his silver Mercedes and ploughed into Chloe Adkins, 20, as she walked along Hagley Road in Edgbaston on 25 January last year.  The third year computer science student died of her injuries. Yesterday an inquest into her death heard that Mr King's seizure could have been brought on by alcohol withdrawal. Chloe Adkins, 20, from Northampton, died after she was struck by a car driven by Ian King, 56, from Derby . The driver, of Littleover, Derby, denied the claims and said he had never had a seizure before and only one since.  And a charge of causing death by dangerous driving was dropped when the case was dismissed because of medical evidence earlier this summer. The inquest at Birmingham Coroner's Court heard how Miss Adkins, from Northampton, was struck by Mr King's Mercedes as she walked along a pavement. Witness Adam Crump told how he had seen the car drive through a red light on the Hagley Road, half a mile before the accident scene. He was the second person at the crash site and checked on Mr King while someone else performed chest compressions on Miss Adkins, a student at Aston University. 'He was sitting in the driver's seat and was agitated, foaming and having some sort of seizure or fit and was shaking and incoherent,' Mr Crump said. Giving evidence, Mr King said he had been at a sales training course in Birmingham and was driving to his home in Derby. He had 'no recollection' of the accident, and said 'The next thing I can remember is waking up in my airbag' and then being escorted into the ambulance. Scene: Miss Adkins, a student at Aston University, was walking along the road when she was hit in January . Mr King said he had never had a seizure before, and had only had one more, while he was sleeping in June last year. He said after the accident his licence had been revoked so he had not driven since. 'I will never drive again, even if I'm allowed to and the seizures are under control,' he said. Asked by assistant coroner Heidi Connor to comment on various doctors saying his seizure was probably brought on by withdrawal from alcohol, he replied: 'No, I have no idea what caused it.' The inquest heard how Miss Adkins died as a result of a catastrophic brain injury. Her family were able to donate her organs. Police investigators said there was a can of lager in Mr King's car but he gave a negative breath test. Dr Sarbjit Clare, who treated Mr King at Birmingham City Hospital, said all the medical evidence suggested he had suffered a seizure. 'My impression is that it was the result of alcohol withdrawal, but he denied it,' she said. The coroner said that although she believed it was entirely possible alcohol withdrawal had played a part in the seizure, she was not going to record it as part of her conclusion. She recorded a conclusion that Chloe died as a result of a road traffic collision. The coroner said it was possible alcohol withdrawal was a factor but did not record it as part of the conclusion .","Chloe Adkins was walking along road in Edgbaston when a car struck her .

"Two thieves have been caught on camera stealing poppy tins as part of a three day spree to raid the charity collections just before Remembrance Sunday. Police are looking for the two men who struck a tea room, pharmacy and three shops in Solihull within a few hours - with some of the thefts taking place within minutes of each other. Their actions have been denounced as a 'wicked and deplorable crime', taking money that had been donated to help war veterans. West Midlands Police has released CCTV footage of the pair as they struck shops and a garden centre over three days to repeatedly swipe collection tins, and are now trying to trace them. Scroll down for video . Police have released CCTV of two men they are trying to find in connection with a string of thefts of poppy collection tins in the West Midlands. A worker in One Stop (pictured) grabbed back one of the tins from the thief . One of the men frequently appears in a 'deerstalker hat.' At 11.35am last Monday the men walked into Meriden Tea Rooms on Fillongley Road, Solihull and pretended to wait to be seated. Security cameras showed one of them take a poppy tin on the counter and calmly place it under his jacket before walking out. They were then seen getting into a green coloured car - possibly a Ford Focus - and speeding off. Then at around 2pm on the same day, a poppy tin was stolen from Balsall Common Pharmacy after a man walked in and placed it in a plastic bag. At 5.45pm the thieves attempted to steal an appeal tin from Blooms Garden Centre in nearby Hampton-in-Arden, but were unsuccessful because it was chained to the counter. Minutes later at 6.30pm, one of the men went into One Stop in Knowle, and tried to steal a poppy tin by cutting the string attaching it to the counter. But he was spotted by a worker who grabbed the tin and the man fled the store. Just 30 minutes later, at around 7pm, another tin was stolen from Threshers on Widney Road also in Knowle. One of the thieves is caught on CCTV cutting a string attaching a poppy collection tin to the counter at One Stop . The man is seen trying to put the tin into his bag - the fourth attempt he had made to steal a poppy tin that day . The man appears to have got away with the theft, putting the scissors and collection tin in his bag at the store . But he is foiled after the worker returns and spots him, removing the poppy collection tin hidden in his bag . The next day, a man walked into Murco petrol station in Knowle, at 2pm and again stuffed a tin under his jacket before walking out. Officers also believe the pair targeted Lloyds Pharmacy in Meriden, as well as the butchers and dry cleaners in Balsall Common. Inspector Allan Green, who is investigating the thefts, said: 'There are no circumstances under which such thefts are justifiable. 'This is a wicked and deplorable crime and we need the public to help us catch those responsible. The men are captured on CCTV casually placing the poppy tins into their coats and bags to steal donations . The string of thefts have taken place days before Remembrance Sunday as preparations are made at Westminster Abbey with red poppies on crosses being planted at the Field of Remembrance . 'This money was intended for service men and women, veterans and their families - people who have risked their lives for our country, and the loved ones of those who gave their lives doing so. 'From our CCTV inquiries, it appears one man usually removes the tin while the other acts as a distraction to anyone who may try and disturb him. 'The first man is described as white, 6ft, of a slim build and in his 20s. He is often seen wearing a distinctive-checked deerstalker hat. 'The other man is described as black, around 5ft 11ins, of a medium build and is also in his 20s. 'We are doing all we can to track down the pair but in the meantime, we would urge any businesses with poppy tins to be vigilant and report any thefts to us at the earliest opportunity.' Anyone with information about the identity of the men is urged to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Two men captured on camera swiping poppy tins from West Midlands stores .

"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was among several witnesses cross-examined at the Ray Rice appeal hearing in New York  yesterday . NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was the first witness called in to Ray Rice's appeal hearing yesterday, and testified under oath for more than two hours. He was among several witnesses cross-examined by NFL Players Association lawyer Jeffrey Kessler as part of the two-day hearing. No details  of the testimony are avaiable. Goodell left the session just after 2pm and climbed into a black SUV without commenting on the case, ABC News reported. Disgraced former NFL star Rice is making his case to return to the field after the league indefinitely suspended him from the game after footage emerged of him knocking his then fiancee unconscious earlier this year. Rice, 27, claims he has been punished twice for the same offense, a one-punch knockout of Janay Palmer during a February altercation at an Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino. Goodell initially gave Rice a two-game suspension for the fight, but in September after video of the punch went viral, he suspended the player indefinitely. Rice has said he explained the incident to Goodell, but the commissioner claims his account was ‘ambiguous’ and was brought into focus when the video of the punch materialized. Goodell said he had not seen the video from inside the casino's elevator until it surfaced on the internet. As well as the NFL commissioner, league security chief Jeffery Miller, Ravens President Dick Cass and Rice are among the witnesses expected to testify at the two-day hearing. Rice's wife, Janay, might also testify. The Ravens cut Rice and his $35 million contract, amid a wave of public criticism that the league had turned a blind eye to domestic violence by players. Scroll down for video . Disgraced former NFL star Ray Rice and wife Janay put on a united front as they arrived for day one of a two day hearing with football bosses in New York City on Wednesday . Other Ravens executives and members of the players union are expected to speak during the hearing before arbitrator Barbara Jones, a former federal judge. The hearing will be closed to the press and public and Jones has issued a gag order forbidding participants from discussing it publicly. Goodell admitted that he ‘didn't get it right’ when he suspended Rice for just two games, and the league has since strengthened its penalties for domestic abuse. The league also hired Lisa Friel, the former head of sex crimes prosecutions in the New York district attorney's office, to help the NFL deal with domestic violence and sexual assault. The player's legal team is expected to argue that even under the league's new domestic violence policy, first-time offender Rice should only be suspended for a maximum of six games. Should Jones side with Rice and his original two-game suspension, the six-year NFL veteran would be free to sign with any team. His legal team is expected to argue that even under the league's new domestic violence policy, first-time offender Rice should only be suspended for a maximum of six games. That amount of games has already passed. Experts are predicting that Rice's suspension will be dropped, leaving him ample time to find another team to join before the season is even halfway over.

But which team would be bold enough to hire him? Last month CBSSports.com reported last that two teams may be willing to take a chance. The first is the Indianapolis Colts, whose coach Chuck Pagano used to work for the Ravens and 'thinks highly' of Rice. Another prospect is the New England Patriots, where coach Bill Belichick has strong ties to Rice's Rutgers University coach Greg Schiano.

"Gough Whitlam was Australia's 21st prime minister from 1972 to 1975 and his rein was as short as it was spectacular. For a man whose first foray into politics actually ended in disappointment, failing to win a spot in local government soon after the end of World War II, his political life will remain forever entwined in Australia history. While his dismissal as PM in 1975 by his former friend and colleague Sir John Kerr is seen as the defining moment, his whirlwind policy overhaul when in power is perhaps now, certainly more than at the time, more fondly remembered. The changes included establishing universal health care through Medibank (the forerunner of Medicare), ending the 'white Australia' policy and fee free university education. Scroll down for video .

Whitlam joined the World War II RAAF, becoming a flight lieutenant and bomber navigator. When the war ended Mr Whitlam had linked with the Labor Party and went on to complete a law degree. Former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam pours soil into the hands of traditional landowner Vincent Lingiari, Northern Territory, 1975. Aboriginal land rights is seen as one of his major legacies to the nation . On November 10 in the year 2000 the former PM helps to plant a millenium tree and bury a time capsule at Westmead hospital in Sydney's west, a day before the 25th anniversary of 'The Dismissal' Gough Whitlam married Margaret in 1942, he often and publicly referred to her as 'the love of my life' 'It's Time' was the catchy slogan which took hold around the country in 1972 as Gough Whitlam campaigned with celebrities like singer Little Pattie . His political breakthrough would arrive in 1951, when Whitlam won pre-selection for the south-west Sydney seat of Werriwa and he quickly rose to prominence in political ranks with a combination of quick wit and radical policies. As deputy and then-leader of the Labor opposition, Whitlam sought to reform Labor Party structures, particularly national and Victorian. He created a shadow ministry and developed a comprehensive set of policies, known as 'the program'. He soon established parliamentary dominance over Prime Minister Billy McMahon after assuming the leadership of the ALP in 1969. But the internal split in ranks (prior to his taking over as leader) which led to the Democratic Labor Party going it alone, would ultimately contribute to his undoing as PM. However, on the back of a very presidential American-style 'It's Time' slogan (which also took its lead from a previous Menzies campaign) he won office on December 2, 1972, ending the Labor Party's 23 years in the wilderness. Medibank . Forged ties with China . Fee free university education . Legal aid . Aboriginal land rights . Stronger racial discrimination laws . Removed the dealth penalty . Free dental care for students . Poured money into public housing . Brought sewerage into major cities . Removed sales tax on contraceptives . Established the Family Court . Extended minimum wage to include women in the workforce . Ended conscription . Removed 'white Australia' policy . Whitlam had flagged his foreign policies well before the election, when in 1971 he travelled to China to meet with state officials. He would also consistently oppose Australia's intervention in East Timor. Once ensconced as PM, the reforms rolled out quickly and spending rose considerably. Indeed, in a frenetic 13 days before a full ministry could even be elected, the so-called 'duumvirate' consisting of just Whitlam and deputy Lance Barnard went to work covering almost 30 portfolios. They would go on to take a staggering 50 plus decisions, which did not require legislation. The Whitlam government overhaul was quickly taking shape. Social and political reforms went into over-drive as they arranged for the release of all Vietnam war draft dodgers and an end to Australia's involvement there with the troops brought back home. There was also an end to conscription. The Family Court of Australia system was set in place and government officials also went as far as organising for the release of uncensored the film 'Portnoy's Complaint' and removing sales tax on contraceptives. Among the social reform changes, there was also the abolition of the death penalty. In the middle of all that, the controversial age of 'white Australia' was brought to a close, as he abolished that controversial long-standing policy. But it was the big-ticket item which polarised opinions. Whitlam's government would ignite universal health care through Medibank (today's Medicare system), fee-free university education and put in place social welfare reform. What rankled with many was that while they lacked control of the Senate, Whitlam's government still managed to abolish fees for tertiary education, reform family law, brought the Commonwealth into urban and regional development and took sewerage systems to many Sydney and Melbourne suburbs. Spending on Aboriginal affairs (including the returning of traditional land to Australia's indigenous community) and the arts increased significantly. The Whitlam government also extended the adult minimum wage to include women workers for the first time, brought in the concept of no-fault divorce and provided the foundation for the Family Court of Australia. Spending continued at very high levels, however, and inflation kept rising. But after an historic joint sitting following the 1974 double dissolution election, Medibank (the precursor of Medicare) was finally set up. However, it started to go wrong from Christmas 1974 when Whitlam was accused of showing too little concern for the victims of Cyclone Tracy. He fell out with several ministers and forced the Speaker to resign. The Junie Morosi affair embroiled Treasurer Jim Cairns and a loans affair forced the resignation of Minerals and Energy Minister Rex Connor. The government's Senate numbers were weakened when a Labor senator died and Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen broke convention by nominating an anti-Labor replacement. The Whitlams share a toast with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai . The economy started to slow dramatically and using control of the Senate, Malcolm Fraser's Coalition opposition blocked supply, effecting stopping the government from being able to pay the bills. And then on November 11, 1975 came the moment which locked Gough Whitlam forever in Australian political history. Governor-General Sir John Kerr resolved the stalemate caused by the Senate's refusal to pass the budget by dismissing the Whitlam government (the first time in the history of Australia's federal parliament) and appointing Malcolm Fraser as caretaker prime minister. Whitlam had long considered Kerr a friend and he was, in fact, a Whitlam appointee. He had disregarded the PM's advice not to seek advice from the High Court and had given him no idea that he might be dismissed. On the other hand, many critics suggest Whitlam had both misread and mismanaged Kerr. Gough Whitlam looks on as his wife Margaret greets Queen Elizabeth at the opening of the Opera House in October 1973 . Margaret Whitlam in later years revealed that her husband admitted he 'should have torn up the (dismissal) letter'. In the election following the dismissal, Labor suffered an unprecedented 30-seat loss and Fraser was confirmed as prime minister. Whitlam stayed on as Labor leader until 1977, when he suffered another heavy defeat. He stepped down and was replaced by Bill Hayden. From 2001. Gough and Margaret Whitlam arrive at the Sydney Convention Centre for 'The Gough Whitlam 85th Birthday Roast' Gough Whitlam, a devoted republican, would go on to receive the order of Australia in 1978 and was later made Australia's Ambassador to UNESCO in Paris. He was chairman of the Australia-China Council for five years and both he and wife Margaret would be made life members of the ALP. Margaret Whitlam passed away in March 2012, Gough Whitlam called her 'the love of my life'.","Gough Whitlam was PM for just three years ending in 'The Dismissal'

"President Barack Obama will announce his intent to nominate prosecutor Loretta Lynch for his next Attorney General tomorrow, a move that would give the top U.S. law enforcement role to a low-key prosecutor with deep experience in both civil rights and corporate fraud cases. A statement released by the White House Press Secretary on the Attorney General Nomination said that President Obama will make the announcement in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, and will be joined by Attorney General Holder and Ms. Lynch. Lynch, 55, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, would be the first African-American woman to hold the job if confirmed by the Senate . 'Ms. Lynch is a strong, independent prosecutor who has twice led one of the most important U.S. Attorney’s Offices in the country,' says a White House Press Statement. 'She will succeed Eric Holder, whose tenure has been marked by historic gains in the areas of criminal justice reform and civil rights enforcement,' concludes the statement. Scroll down for video . According to a report from CNN, Loretta Lynch, U.S. attorney for the eastern district of New York, is expected to be President Barack Obama's pick for attorney general.  Lynch is pictured here at a press conference in in April . President Barack Obama also played coy today  before the official announcement when asked by a reporter if he'd settled on a particular candidate.

Senate confirmation process. Her nomination will be one of the first big changes for . Obama to announce after Republicans won control of the Senate in . congressional elections on Tuesday. Lynch was one of several . candidates Holder had recommended to succeed him.

Other candidates who were reportedly being considered were Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli and Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. Perez may have undergone special scrutiny in the Senate confirmation process, however, over a 'secret deal' he allegedly cut with the city of St. Paul, Minnesota, when he worked at the Justice Department. The issue came up in a 2013 confirmation hearing when he was under consideration for labor secretary and would be a sticking point again if Obamahad chosen him.

"Bereaved bikers in Virginia can now order a Harley Davidson hearse to bear their deceased loved ones. Funeral home owner Michael Turch rolled out the venture at his three funeral homes to give citizens of Alexandria and Dale City, Virginia, a more unique option. And with two services in the first week, the custom-built 2014 Harley Davidson Road King is already a hit. Easy rider to the end: Three funeral homes in Alexandria and Dale City, Virginia, now offer Harley hearses . 'When I pull in the parking lot, people will literally turn around and drive into our parking lot and take pictures,' Turch told ABC News. 'I've been here 24 years and no one has ever stopped me with any of my other hearses and said, ""Hey, when I go, I want to ride in this.""' The first time it was used, last week, was for a woman who had never ridden a Harley in her life but her family felt it would be a memorable way to say goodbye, Turch explained to Inside Nova. The second was for a Harley Davidson mechanic. 'His family just thought it would be perfect,' he said. It is not the first time a Harley Hearse has taken to the streets. In demand: Two families have already used the feature in services since it was rolled out last week . Bespoke: Funeral director Michael Turch customized a 2014 Harley Davidson Road King to fit a coffin . Firms in Pennsylvania and New York have had Harley funeral options for years. In fact, it was when one of these Harleys was brought over to Dale City by a visiting family that Turch became inspired to join the trend. 'We had a family about six years that had one - they found it on their own,' he said. 'And over the years, everyone would comment, hey, remember when you had that motorcycle hearse? So that resonated with me.' 'Nobody's going to remember the box or the urn years from now, but if you create a meaningful ceremony they'll remember that,' he added. Unique: Turch said he wanted to offer customers something special to say goodbye to their loved ones .

"A petrified Australian woman was left screaming for her life as a stampeding elephant chased her safari tour Jeep. Liz Jacobs was on a wildlife excursion in Sri Lanka's Kaudulla National Park when she began begging her tour driver to steer clear of a large herd of elephants.

Starting off by running in line with the vehicle, it wasn't long before the elephant appeared only metres behind the jeep which had sped up to avoid its reach. 'We're going to crash into them!' Ms Jacobs could be heard screaming while repeating the word 'no, no, no'. Despite the elephant trumpeting its warning in the distance, Ms Jacobs' squeals drowned out the animal's sounds as she yelled to the drivers, 'faster, faster! Keep going!' 'We really thought we were gonna die for a moment and then the elephant just backed off,' she said after the event, according to Nine News. Ms Jacobs' shrill ear-splitting shrieks drowned out the animal's trumpeting as the Australian admitted she was convinced that she was going to die . 'I must have hurt his ears with my screaming!' Ms Jacobs can be heard sobbing in the footage towards the end of the video after the elephant finally gave up the chase. 'We didn't want to go near them, but the drivers just kept going and did what they're paid to do,' she said. 'We did swing wide to avoid the elephants as we didn't want to interfere with them. But one jeep in particular just got too close. 'The elephant started to charge and the other jeep overtook us leaving us to be chased.

"The son of Hillsong founder Frank Houston says it is obvious his father was a paedophile as he admits to not knowing how many victims the church leader allegedly sexually abused. Brian Houston gave his first sermon at Hillsong on Sunday since testifying about his father's sexual abuse last week at a Royal Commission, amid claims he tried to cover up his dad's alleged paedophilia when he was first informed. 'At that time I thought there was one (victim) and then 12 months later it became clear there were many more, mostly in New Zealand,' Mr Houston told Today. 'It's obvious he was a paedophile and that his behaviour was repetitive and it seems like it was over a period of a decade in the late sixties and seventies.' Scroll down for video . Hillsong leader Brian Houston says having to confront his paedophile father - the church's founder Frank Houston - after he was told of his sexual abuse was the 'worst day of my life' Brian Houston (left) gave his first sermon at Hillsong on Sunday since testifying about his father Frank Houston's (right) sexual abuse at a Royal Commission last week . He said having to confront his paedophile father after he was told of his alleged sexual abuse was the 'worst day of my life'. 'The shock of finding out was just horrendous… and having to confront him in my office was even more horrendous and it was such a difficult moment,' he said. 'I think he knew it was about to come down on him – he was depressed and stressed. He knew he had done it and he admitted he had done it. 'It was tense and I did what I had to do which was suspending his ministry credential and he never preached again from that day.' The senior pastor defended his decision to not inform police after finding out about his father's alleged sexual abuse because the victim, referred to only as AHA, did not want a police or church investigation. 'I find the cover up word frustrating because I genuinely don't believe it is right,' he said. 'This is one of the things that made it complicated. He was adamant he didn't want any kind of police investigation or even a church investigation, he just wanted it dealt with and he just wanted to know that justice was going to happen.' Mr Houston said he believed he was doing the right thing at the time by informing the church's elders and the overarching Australian Christian Churches organisation. The senior pastor defended his decision to not inform police after finding out about his father's alleged sexual abuse because the victim, referred to only as AHA, did not want a police or church investigation .

Mr Houston said his congregation, who gathered in their thousands at the church at Bauklham Hills in western Sydney, gave him a standing ovation after he delivered his first sermon on Sunday addressing his father's sexual abuse. 'They responded warmly, they love us. There's people who are going to say what about the victim, who is giving them support – it's a fair question,' he told Today. 'It just grieves me that my father damaged lives to that extent, like literarily destroyed people's lives. 'It's also a humiliating thing – what worse thing to be told about your father that he's a paedophile. It's a cruel blow. I hate paedophilia.' Mr Houston said those outside Hillsong had reacted differently to those inside to news of sexual abuse within the church. 'They have done the journey with us so there'd be very few people (at Hillsong) with any surprises. I've never hidden it from the church.' Brian Houston fronted the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Abuse in Sydney last week to testify about his father's alleged abuse . Mr Houston was first told of the allegations made by the victim, AHA, in late October 1999 . Mr Houston was first told of the allegations made by the victim, AHA, in late October 1999 during his weekly meeting with the Hillsong's general manager George Aghajanian. He originally told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse that he did not immediately report the incident to the police as he did not want to 'pre-empt' the victim. 'It hit me in a ten second period, in a wave, you never forget' the moment you find out your father is a paedophile,' he told the commission, . He told the hearing he first he had to get his head around his father being a homosexual, before he realised Mr Aghanajanian was talking about paedophilia. Mr Houston then cried and went home. 'I was devastated, to be honest with you. Totally devastated.' Last Tuesday, AHA told the commission Frank Houston would stay with his family when he came to Sydney from New Zealand in the 1970s. AHA was seven when Frank Houston would come to his room, lie on him, fondle him and masturbate him, the alleged victim told the commission. 'I would wake up petrified and I would stay very still,' AHA said. He said the abuse left him feeling ashamed, and he now suffered depression. Mr Houston told the hearing that if AHA was under 18 - he was in his mid-30s at the time of the complaint - then he was 'absolutely certain' they would have gone to the police. 'Rightly or wrongly, I thought I would be pre-empting the victim if I were to have called the police at that point,' Mr Houston said. Mr Houston told the hearing that if AHA was under 18 - he was in his mid-30s at the time of the complaint - then he was 'absolutely certain' they would have gone to the police . Mr Houston is the senior pastor at the Hillsong Church, located in Sydney's north-western suburbs . Rules were set aside by the executive of the Pentecostal movement when it came to dealing with allegations against Frank Houston the national inquiry was told last week. Keith Ainge, former national secretary of the Assemblies of God, an umbrella body for the Pentecostal churches, said that Brian Houston was the only conduit for information to the executive about allegations against his father. The church elder told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that the first the national executive heard of allegations against Frank Houston was when his son Brian Houston called a special meeting of the executive on December 22, 1999. Brian Houston was national president of the AoG. He had already suspended his father when he called the meeting. Pastor Ainge on Thursday said that under AoG rules Frank Houston should have had his credentials withdrawn for abusing a child.

"Struck off: Vanessa Law, 32, broke into a house and stole cash while addicted to heroin . A primary school teacher who broke into a house and stole cash to fund her heroin habit is to be formally struck off from the profession. Vanessa Law, 32, also stole petrol from garages in Fife and Glasgow during a crime spree in 2012. The former addict is currently living at her grandmother's house in Fife, Scotland, where she claims to be 'in recovery'. She will be officially taken off the teaching register at a 'removal with consent' hearing on November 5. The General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) charged her with five offences including one on July 2012 in Lochgelly, Fife, where she stole a key and participated in theft by housebreaking. It is thought that Ms Law, who worked at the nearby Methilhill Primary, broke into the house to help fund her drug habit. The GTCS report also claims that Law 'while working as a teacher [was] actively using illegal drugs, namely heroin'. They add that in March  2012 she stole  fuel from a Shell garage, and later that year she repeated the crime in Glasgow and Dunfermline. Answering the door of her grandmother's home this week Ms Law said: 'I just want to say I'm in recovery, I don't really want to speak about it right now because it's personal. 'Life is getting better day by day, I'm in recovery'.

Methilhill Primary School confirmed that Ms Law worked at the school between August 15, 2011, and October 28, 2012. The house that Ms Law was caught raiding belongs to Andrew Whitelaw, a convicted paedophile who was serving a four-and half-year sentence at the time of the burglary. Mr Whitelaw had at the house the largest haul of child pornography ever seized by Fife Police - 204,000 indecent images and 3,001 indecent videos of children. Whitelaw also served time behind bars for assaulting eight children.","Vanessa Law, 32, also stole petrol from garages in Fife and Glasgow in 2012 .

"Australia's newest wildlife warrior is about to show the world how to dig out the most dangerous reptiles from backyards, beds and household bathrooms. Former pastry chef Julia Baker, 45, is about to morph into Snake Sheila, a fearless snake charmer whose face-to-face encounters with Queensland's most dangerous reptiles will be documented in a new television series. From encountering deadly eastern brown snakes inside children's bedrooms to removing them off roofs, the 10-part documentary series will follow her as she visits the homes of Brisbane residents to remove the unwanted slippery visitors. Scroll down for video . The Snake Sheila will take on television screens from January 2016 when she documents her life as a reptile handler . Her love of snakes spawned out of a visit to Australia Zoo which became the impetus for a new career . In the program Snake Sheila captures snakes hidden in bedrooms and other parts of the home . The Queensland capital - home to some of the world's deadliest varieties of reptiles including eastern brown snakes, death adders, eastern tigers, and coastal taipans - will be the backdrop for the show set to air in 2016. With cane toads, domestic pets and other feral animals on the menu, snakes are on the move and there's only so many people qualified to catch and release them. That's where Snake Sheila steps in. Better known as Julia  Baker - Snake Sheila  was born in Australia to European parents - and became a qualified reptile handler after years as a pastry chef. She split from her husband six years ago and quit her job to spend time doing things that brought her happiness. Armed with a long hook, a bag and appropriate clothing Ms Baker brings snakes from out of the dark and puts them back in to the wild . It was after a trip to Australia Zoo in Beerwah,Queensland where she began her new life. 'I just fell in love, I felt so differently to everyone else getting a photo with the snakes, they all walked away saying 'yuck! they feel so gross' but I found them to be so beautiful and misunderstood.' She now spends her days removing eastern brown snakes from underneath concrete slabs and climbing roofs to check drains and down piping. But it's her fear of heights, and not the threat of being bitten, which has her most worried when she attends to unwanted visitors inside homes. 'It's not the dangerous, venomous snakes i'm afraid of catching,' she said. 'It's climbing ladders and hopping on roofs to reef them out, particularly if you don't know what snake you're catching.' On one occasion she recalls coming face-to-face with a red belly black snake in shorts and thongs - a dress-code  advised against when tackling one of Australia's most dangerous animals. During the adrenaline-pumping ordeal, she said she the home owners described a vastly different variety of snake to what she encountered. 'I was told it was just a green tree snake, which aren't venomous.' 'But when I arrived wearing just shorts and thongs, it was in fact a red belly black snake curled up in the corner of a room.' Filming for the show has begun and will be broadcast on Animal Planet in 2016 . Apart from the actual handling of the animals themselves, the Snake Sheila series also hopes to educate people about misconceptions revolving around the reptile, in particular, that a 'good snake is a dead snake.' 'This is far from the truth,' Ms Baker said. 'A good snake is a respected snake and if Australia didn't have snakes, we would be inundated with rats.' 'They'd bring a lot of diseases with them.' 'People have to understand that we really need snakes and that if the snake is properly respected, there's no need to be afraid of them.' Program producer Mandy Lake said unlike the main star - some of Snake Sheila's crew members are a little reluctant to get too close to the scaly animals. 'While I'm very excited by the prospect of showcasing our fantastic characters and magnificent snakes to the world, I am completely and utterly snake phobic,' she said. 'You could say that the promo shoots we've had so far, particularly the one with the brown snake in the baby's bedroom, have been somewhat challenging for me and I am treating the upcoming shoots as aversion therapy.' The program will air on Animal Planet across every region except Canada and the US when it starts in January 2016. Julia Baker also discovered a love of motorcycles when her marriage broke down . Eastern brown snakes, red belly black snakes and pythons feature in the program .","Julie Baker quit her job as a pastry chef to become a snake handler .

"For years, the Burberry check was a mark of wealth and good taste, with the beige scarf considered a useful experience that would make any outfit. Retailing at £315, it was a wardrobe item that was rarely seen on people without a few zeros in their bank account. But in the late 1990's, the scarf was adopted by the Brit Pop clan, worn by the likes of Liam Gallagher, Robbie Williams and Nicole Appleton and soon became a status stamp for the cool youth. Adele (left) is one of the A-List celebrities helping the Burberry check to make a comeback, she was pictured wearing the distinctive pattern on a scarf while leaving an FKA Twigs gig in London last week. The style has suffered since it began to be associated with 'chav' culture in the early noughties, when D-List stars including Danniella Westbrook (right) started to wear it in abundance . But the tide started to turn against the British designer when companies started to produce imitation items featuring the recognisable square design. Soon knock-off Burberry check was being sold on items like baseball caps and scarves for as little as 99p across the UK. The turning point came in 2004, when former EastEnders actress Danniella Westbrook she dressed her daughter in a matching Burberry check outfit, complete with a pushchair covered in the distinctive pattern. By 2004, pubs and clubs across the country began  refusing entry to customers who dressed in the label. Burberry started to remove the check from most of their items in an effort to distance themselves from customers who might give them a bad name. The plan worked and slowly the distinctively patterned scarf has started to re-emerge as a popular accessory among A-List celebrities. Only a week again, Adele was pictured leaving an FKA Twigs gig in London wearing a modern-version of the scarf. A few months ago, style icon Cara Delevingne was snapped wearing the original nineties version, while Gwen Stefani went even further in a checked raincoat.

"Harry Redknapp has distanced QPR from a January transfer window move for Robbie Keane. Old Redknapp quotes appeared this week after Keane’s exploits for LA Galaxy in the MLS Cup final, and the veteran manager set the record straight on Thursday. ‘We’ve not made an enquiry about him (Keane). He belongs to LA Galaxy, and is the star man of their team and league. They wouldn’t let him go,’ he said. Redknapp has distanced himself from reports that QPR are interested in signing LA Galaxy's Robbie Keane .

Even so, Redknapp is an admirer of the 34-year-old Dubliner. ‘Robbie’s an amazing footballer, one of the best pros I’ve come across,’ he said. Keane, who has a year left on his contract at Galaxy, last had a winter loan spell in the Premier League three years ago, at Aston Villa. After a busy season at Galaxy, Keane has indicated he will take a breather before weighing up whether a new move might be of benefit. ‘I definitely need to recharge the batteries and see what the next chapter is for me, whether it’s here (Galaxy) or it’s somewhere else,’ said the Republic of Ireland captain.

"A welfare cheat who took £20,000 in state handouts by claiming he could barely walk was caught working as a delivery driver - and clambering over walls. Steven Higgins, 50, told the Department for Work and Pensions he was in constant pain, needed a walking stick and even required help cooking meals at home. But a fraud investigator saw him using steps and carrying out his business as a courier without any discomfort and at one point was event filmed climbing over a 5ft wall. Scroll down for video . Steven Higgins, pictured, bends his legs as he prepares to leap up over the wall. He is being filmed by a DWP fraud officer . Over the top: Despite claiming he could hardly walk, Steven Higgins hitches a leg on top of the wall and hauls himself over . Mission accomplished: In seconds, benefits cheat Steven Higgins has flipped over the wall and carries on walking on the other side . Inquiries revealed Higgins of Crawshawbooth, near Rossendale in Lancashire, had claimed Disability Living Allowance (DLA) over five years and netted £19,492. He is no longer in receipt of the benefit - yet is appealing the DWP’s decision to remove it. At Burnley magistrates' court, Higgins admitted two counts of dishonestly making a false statement to obtain a benefit, between May 9, 2008 and September 10, 2013. He was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, suspended for a year, and was ordered to pay £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge. Prosecutor Andrew Robinson said Higgins made his claim for DLA, saying he could walk less than 20 metres in seven to 10 minutes and that would permanently be the case. He told the DWP he sometimes needed a walking stick, was in constant pain, would not feel comfortable out on his own and needed help at home. Higgins also claimed he could not prepare meals. But Mr Robinson said evidence was available to show his situation changed and was no longer as severe as his original claim. Steven Higgins, pictured outside Burnley Magistrates court, who claimed £20,000 in disability benefits, was  kater seen working as a courier and climbing over walls, a court heard . He was self-employed as a courier driver for a company and had not notified the department of this or any improvement in his condition. The prosecutor said a fraud investigator saw the defendant working and he was observed climbing over walls, using steps and 'going about his business in a normal manner with no discomfort.' Mr Robinson added it was not a fraud from the outset. The defendant, who had no previous convictions, had not yet repaid any of the money. In mitigation Jeremy Frain, defending, said the criminality was not the fact Higgins was working. But there was an 'indiscretion' if a person put on the original claim form they could only walk five feet without having to stop for a breather and were discovered to have walked six or seven feet without stopping. The defendant had attended a rheumatology clinic and Mr Frain read out part of a medical letter, which stated his client had 'progressive destructive disease' and marked damage to his hands and feet which would undoubtedly limit his ability to perform daily functions. Mr Frain said Higgins had been suffering anxiety and had to have treatment as a result of the protracted court proceedings. The solicitor added: 'I am quite sure he’s extremely remorseful. He’s terrified at the prospect of an immediate custodial sentence. 'It’s his first conviction and he loses his good name because of this. I don’t think for one minute it will be repeated. At the moment he’s not in receipt of DLA and it will be the subject of an appeal. 'He regards himself as trying to help himself by working to keep him going, rather than sitting sedentary at home and his condition getting worse rather than better.

Steven Higgins admitted two counts of dishonestly making a false statement to obtain a benefit when he appeared at Burnley magistrates' court, pictured . 'This is a serious matter but I would ask you to give him a chance to retain his liberty. The family are generally very much in debt.'

'We are determined to find those who we suspect are cheating the system by following up on tip-offs, undertaking surveillance and working with local councils.

"A Romanian man has been arrested on suspicion of ferrying eight suspected illegal immigrants across the English Channel in an inflatable boat. Border Force officers intercepted eight suspected illegal immigrants just five miles from Dover when their boat broke down and was drifting dangerously close to shipping lanes. It is believed that the Romanian national tried to sneak the eight Afghan men under the cover of darkness into Britain when the 50hp engine on board his inflatable boat ran out of fuel. The RNLI found the rigid inflatable boat was located by the RNLI about five miles from the port of Dover in Kent after receiving a report from a passing cross channel ferry fearing it was going to drift into busy shipping lanes . Crew aboard a passing P&O ferry alerted the Coastguard after spotting the small craft in difficulty at 6.40am yesterday. The RNLI and Border Force raced to the scene, approximately five miles from the port of Dover in Ken to tow the stricken boat to safety. The rescue team managed to bring the boat ashore at 9.55am, when the Romanian man was arrested on suspicion of assisting unlawful immigration. RNLI Dover Lifeboat spokesman Tony Hawkins said: 'The vessel had suffered engine failure and its occupants were drifting in choppy seas with a force four wind blowing. 'They were spotted by passing vessels concerned for their safety which called the Coastguard. The occupants were cold but didn't need medical attention. 'They were lucky. They were drifting in an incredibly busy stretch of water with the wind picking up. We're glad everyone is safe and well.' The Romanian man was believed to have been trying to smuggle the eight Afghans into Britain under the cover of darkness when the 50hp outboard motor ran out of fuel, leaving the boat drifting in force four winds . He said when they arrived the crew set up a tow to the immigrants' boat and waited for a Border Force vessel to arrive. The Border Force cutter vessel then took over the tow and brought the boat and its nine occupants to Dover lifeboat station, with the RNLI crew providing an escort. A ship worker, who witnessed the drama, said: 'This is the first time I've ever seen a craft like this make it across the Channel. They obviously made a great attempt to get across one of the most dangerous shipping routes in the world. 'You might say they were very brave but also very foolish as they could have died. 'They could easily have been run over by a large tanker and they must have set off during darkness so it was incredibly risky. 'We saw them and then we saw the lifeboat coming out to them. They're lucky to have been rescued.' The condition of the nine people is thought to be ok. There was no call for any medical assistance and they all appeared to be well. Immigration Enforcement Officers have launched a criminal investigation after the attempted channel crossing . A Border Force spokesperson said: 'Border Force is aware of an incident off the coast of Dover involving an inflatable craft carrying suspected illegal immigrants. 'One Romanian male has been arrested on suspicion of assisting unlawful immigration and eight Afghani nationals have been detained. 'A criminal investigation has been launched by Immigration Enforcement officers.' They were being kept in custody at a police station in Dover and are likely to be taken later to an immigration detention centre, although the Romanian man faces possibly being charged and appearing in court. This is a repeat of a similar incident which happened on June 6 when a Mongolian man was rescued from the middle of the English Channel trying to paddle to England in a rubber dinghy. He was spotted in a 4ft long blue inflatable kayak by a fishing boat eight miles from shore. His craft was described as being similar to those stocked by Decathlon which has a store in Calais.","Romanian national arrested trying to ferry suspected illegal immigrants .

"A dog breeder who claimed almost £17,000 in benefits claiming she had difficult walking was caught when investigators filmed her jogging with her prized Collies in a show ring. Susan Malpas conned the taxpayer out of thousands in disability living allowance over six years - even saying she needed help leaving her house. But undercover fraud investigators from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) filmed the 62-year-old parading her Collie at a dog show on August 31 last year. Con: Susan Malpas pictured jogging with one of her prized pets at a dog show. she fraudulently claimed £17,000 in benefits . The 43-second video shows Malpas - who is wearing cream trousers, a red t-shirt and a brown jacket - jogging around the arena at the Canine Show at Stoneleigh Park, Warwickshire in front of an audience. Incredibly, despite telling the DWP she was unable to walk very far and had poor mobility, the footage shows her jogging for three laps of the show ring. Malpas, of Willenhall in the West Midlands, admitted falsely claiming the benefits when she was interviewed by investigators. Susan Malpas pictured arriving at court. She  the DWP she was unable to walk very far and had poor mobility . And she pleaded guilty to an offence of failing to notify of a change of circumstances between May 16, 2007 and October 29, 2013 with a view to obtain payment of benefit at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Thursday. The charge also included failing to promptly notify the Department for Work and Pensions of a change in circumstances namely that her physical capabilities had improved and that she knew that this would affect her entitlement to claim disability living allowance. Judge Philip Parker adjourned the case for a pre-sentence report to be prepared. Malpas, who falsely claimed and received £16,826 she was not entitled to, was granted unconditional bail and will be sentenced on August 8. After the hearing, Sian Fellowes, DWP Fraud Manager in the West Midlands, said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. 'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of. 'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net. 'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime. Don't wait for fraud investigators to find you.' On her website - called Lanlin Rough Collies - Malpas boasts about the 'good time' she has had breeding dogs and appearing at shows. The site includes pictures of numerous dogs she has bred and even has pictures of her at Crufts.

'I am a member of most of the Rough Collie Breed clubs and serve on The Midlands Collie Club committee as their health co-ordinator. 'I breed all three colours of the Rough Collie and offer a lifetimes help and advice. I am also on the groomers list for Rough Collies.

"If you're longing for a place to host some Great Gatsby-esque parties, this gem of a property will leave you leave you dizzy with desire. The 1920s grandiose manor went on sale this week. It was built by renowned architect William Hardy Wilson, who is referred to on the NSW State Library archives as 'one of the leading lights of Australian architecture of the twentieth century.'

One of  multiple living areas in the house, which is also fit with 6 bedrooms and bathrooms and a double lock-up garage . Ray White Real Estate agent Elliott Placks says 'the view is pretty anomalous...there aren't many houses in the Eastern suburbs with unrestrained views of the harbour like that' Ray White Real Estate agent Elliott Placks says the biggest distinctions is the proportions.  'The rooms are truly are impressive. They have high ceilings and a lot of grandeur.' He says the size is another defining feature. 'It's pretty uncommon to have a property on the harbour of this size' Placks says, referring to the 1300 sq meters of space on the property. 'It means buyers have the privilege of enjoying the property in all of its grandeur, or subdividing and creating a second residence.' The house is fit with 6 bedrooms and bathrooms, a double lock-up garage and multiple living zones. But perhaps the most alluring aspect is the design: think soaring ceilings, polished floorboards, extra wide corridors of palatial proportions. Placks says the house was built with predominantly Mediterranean influence. 'It's very Italian-esque. There large columns and big arches throughout the property which have a real classic appeal.' 'The view is also pretty anomalous. I mean, there aren't many houses in the Eastern suburbs with unrestrained views of the harbour like that. It's pretty special.' The boat shed and in built boat ramp that come with the property. Mr Placks says this is an anomalous feature on the current market . A birds eye view of the property, which is 1300 square metres in size and was built by William Hardy Wilson, one of the 'leading lights of Australian architecture of the twentieth century' The property was last sold for 25 million in 2007, and Placks says he expects a marked improvement from this price on account of the growth of the market. A view of the garden: Point Piper is quickly earning a reputation of being a 'millionaires row', with five property sales over 30 million there in the tiny square kilometre suburb. Another distinctive feature of the property are the vessel facilities. 'It comes with a boatshed and pre built boat ramp. I don't think you'll find many properties with that these days.' The property was last sold for 25 million in 2007. Placks says he expects a marked improvement from this price on account of the growth of the market. There are also signs from comparable properties in the same quarters, Placks says. '106 Wolseley St recently sold for 30 million, and that's roughly an equivalent size to this property.'

"Two illegal immigrants who conned the Government into allowing them to stay in Britain as asylum seekers and claimed £130,000 in benefits just by changing their names face jail today. Mohammed Zakariya Wadiwala, 42, and wife Zenabbibi, 44, used a false identities to claim asylum in the UK from India in 2007 before claiming handouts for themselves and their five children. The couple landed in Britain under the bogus name Sheikh instead of Wadiwali, meaning the family's asylum case has 'dragged on for years', Preston Crown Court heard. Guilty: Mohammed Zakariya Wadiwala, 42, and wife Zenabbibi, 44, used a false identities to claim asylum in the UK from India in 2007 before claiming handouts for themselves and their five children . Prosecutors say had their  real name been known to the authorities they would have been deported back to their homeland within a 'matter of months'. The couple claimed they had lost all their documentation and were in danger if they returned to India. While their asylum case rumbled on they claimed up to £2,000 a month over almost six years to house and feed themselves and their family. In all they pocketed £134,438 worth of benefits before being arrested following an investigation in 2012 . At Preston Crown Court the couple, of Blackburn, Lancashire, spoke through an Urdu interpreter to plead guilty to fraud linked to false identities and claiming financial support, and were told they face jail. Granting both unconditional bail until sentencing next month Judge Ian Leeming QC said: 'Rather than a speedy refusal of asylum, the matter dragged on for years during which time more benefits and advantaged accrued - on the face of it £134,438 worth of benefits. 'The court is keeping all its sentencing options open. It seems clear that some form of custody will be appropriate'. If they are jailed they will serve their sentence and then most likely be deported. Earlier the court heard how Wadiwala, a Muslim had married his wife a Hindu in 2003, claimed they had to flee to Britain fearing persecution - after one of their children was killed due the cultural differences. They arrived in the UK with two children but Wadiwala illegally used the name Jakir Sheikh - which he had previously used in India - and claimed Mrs Wadiwala as a 'dependent'. It is thought the couple then went on to have more children as his claim for asylum was processed. The prosecution told the court: 'It's a fraud. When he arrived he gave the name of Jakir Sheikh and claimed Mrs Wadiwala as a dependent. She became the main claimant. It's a joint enterprise. When he arrived, he arrived on proper documentation then adopted Sheikh for his asylum claim. 'Had Mr and Mrs Wadiwala claimed asylum under their own names the claim would have been fast tracked and dealt with within a matter of months. 'When they arrived in this country from India they had their own passports in their own names, because the data was available the checks could have been made with India very quickly. 'They would have been deported within a matter of months. For a matter of months they would have been entitled to benefits. 'Because they said they had lost all the identity documents it took much, much longer.' Case: Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard the couple claim they fled to Britain fearing persecution because he was Muslim and she was Hindu, which lead to one of their children being killed . Wadiwala pleaded guilty to making a false representation to an immigration officer that his name was Jakir Sheikh and he had come to the UK to seek asylum enabling him to obtain financial and other support. He also admitted possession of false identity documents with intent and possession of a NASS card used to establish registered facts about self. His wife pleaded guilty to possessing false identity documents with intent, possessing a NASS card used to establish registered facts about herself and making a false representation to an immigration officer that her name was Shabnam Sheikh and she had come to the UK to seek asylum enabling her to obtain financial and other support. The offences took place between August 2007 and December 2012. Wadiwala's counsel Kenneth Hind said that his client had changed his name in India in order to avoid persecution and came to the UK on a passport in his 'birth name.' He added that it was accepted that he should have used his name Wadiwala and said neither the immigration authorities or the Indian authorities were able to identify Mr and Mrs Sheikh. Through the translator Wadiwala said of his wife: 'The result of her changing her faith led to the killing of one of my children. They tried to kill us both and tried to kidnap her. 'The Hindu family turning to the religion of Islam is not welcome and people do not accept it. There is a huge risk. As a result of conversions in India there are many examples where girls have been killed as a result. 'I wanted to save my children and and my wife and I had no choice but to change my name at deed poll and as a result fled India. The reason why there's a change because I was threatened, my life was under threat. People had attempted to kill me.' He said he went to Mumbai but that persecutors found him. He added that he came to the UK to 'save my life'.","Mohammed and Zenabbibi Wadiwala used false identities to claim asylum .

'Odds that this rotten dog rolled in poop and I had to give him a bath (with two broken wrists, mind you) not once but TWICE today? Apparently pretty high #BuyingALotteryTicket #RottenDog #CharlieDog' Just minutes before posting the image of the disgraced Beagle, Lara had shared another snap of her beloved pooch enjoying a walk at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester, which is where Eric popped the question back in July - during a dog walk. Keen followers of Lara's Instagram account will no doubt recognize Charlie the Beagle who is frequently featured in her photographs - and has even been credited with helping her through her injuries. Until now, that is. Luckily it wasn't all doom and gloom for the poor bride-to-be who later posted a cute candid snap of herself and 30-year-old Eric in celebration of the one-week countdown to their wedding. Alongside the picture, Lara wrote a simple caption, saying only: 'One week to go!!!!! #wedding #countdown #love' Wedding bells: Eric (L) and Lara are set to wed on November 8 . Part of the family: Beloved dog Charlie was part of Eric's proposal plans. The couple were out walking the miniature Beagle when the 30-year-old popped the question . 'Thanks to my helper': When he's not busy misbehaving, Charlie has been a source of comfort to Lara while she recovers from her injuries . The couple, who have been dating for six years, are set to marry in front of their friends and family at the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, on Saturday. They will begin the wedding festivities with a wine tasting at the Trump Winery on Friday November 7, followed by the black-tie ceremony on Saturday and a brunch on Sunday. Last week, Lara's future father-in-law Donald Trump told MailOnline that the wedding would go ahead as planned, despite the bride-to-be's injuries. 'Her fingers are exposed. So the ring is good,' he said. 'It's too bad. But she's really strong, and they dig each other, so that's important.'","The 31-year-old's Beagle 'rolled in poop' while enjoying a walk at the Trump National Golf Club in Westchester .

"ISIS fighters have fired a crude chemical weapon at the Kurdish forces defending the Syria-Turkey border town of Kobane, it has been reported. BBC reporter Güney Yıldız says a Kurdish official from the war-torn town told him of a suspected IS chemical attack last night, which has caused people to lose their eyesight, blistering on the skin and respiratory problems. Testing on victims has not taken place because of the intensity of the fighting there, but a Kurdish doctor in the town, who was also injured by the strike, says he is '75 per cent' sure it is a chemical weapon. There was also speculation it was an unsophisticated warhead containing chlorine, similar to weapons used in the First World War. Savage: A photo of a victim of a reported chemical attack on the Syrian town of Kobane. It is claimed ISIS fighters fired a crude chemical weapon at the war zone . This photo reportedly shows a skin blister caused by the alleged chemical weapon attack . Swelling: Testing on victims has not taken place because of the intensity of the fighting there . Last week the Iraqi government reported that ISIS controls a vast compound in Iraq containing 2,500 rusting chemical weapons rockets. The site was bombed by the US during the 1991 Gulf War, but the munitions there were only partially destroyed, according to the UN - then left to Iraq to take care of. However, Iraqi officials wrote to the United Nations this summer claiming that abandoned weapons containing the lethal nerve agent Sarin are still in the ruins of the Muthanna State Establishment, which made chemical weapons in the 1980s and early 1990s, and that this is now in the hands of the violent jihadists. They warned that they had watched equipment there being looted on CCTV. Turkish Army T-155 howitzers stand in firing position near the Turkish-Syrian border today .

Militants then shut the surveillance cameras at the depot down, the New York Times reported. Iraq's UN Ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim wrote to the UN saying that 'armed terrorist groups' took over the Muthanna complex, which lies 60 miles north of Baghdad, on June 11. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Ambassador Mohamed Ali Alhakim said remnants of a former chemical weapons programme are kept in two bunkers there. 'The project management spotted at dawn on Thursday, 12 June 2014, through the camera surveillance system, the looting of some of the project equipment and appliances, before the terrorists disabled the surveillance system,' Alhakim wrote in the letter dated June 30. 'The Government of Iraq requests the States Members of the United Nations to understand the current inability of Iraq, owing to the deterioration of the security situation, to fulfill its obligations to destroy chemical weapons,' he said. The Muthanna complex measures three by three miles and was thought to be capable of producing around 4,000 tonnes of nerve agent a year. Secrets: In 2002 President George W. Bush said Hussein was developing a program of chemical weapons but no evidence of such weapons was ever found . Alhakim singled out the capture of bunkers 13 and 41 in the sprawling complex 35 miles (56 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad in the notorious 'Sunni Triangle.' The last major report by U.N. inspectors on the status of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program was released about a year after the experts left in March 2003. It states that Bunker 13 contained 2,500 sarin-filled 122-mm chemical rockets produced and filled before 1991, and about 180 tons of sodium cyanide, 'a very toxic chemical and a precursor for the warfare agent tabun.' However, U.S. Defence Department spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said earlier that the United States' best understanding was that 'whatever material was kept there is pretty old and not likely to be able to be accessed or used against anyone right now'. 'We aren't viewing this particular site and their holding it as a major issue at this point,' Kirby said. 'Should they even be able to access the materials, frankly, it would likely be more of a threat to them than anyone else.' It was revealed this week that about 5,000 chemical weapons were recovered or destroyed in Iraq following the 2003 invasion but the Pentagon chose to keep the findings top secret. An investigation by The New York Times has revealed that U.S. forces happened across the hidden caches of warheads, shells and aviation bombs between 2004 and 2011. But the information wasn't made public for several embarrassing reasons including the fact some of the weapons were U.S.-made, plus they had been sitting dormant since the early 1980s and therefore didn't support President George W. Bush's rationale for going to war. The weapons - most of them mustard agents in 155-millimeter artillery shells or 122-millimeter rockets - were developed by Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war which raged between 1980 and 1988. But on September 12, 2002, President Bush had contended that Hussein was developing new chemical weapons capable of 'mass destruction'. 'Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons,' he said. But all the weapons found had been developed before 1991. In March 2003, President Bush received a mandate from the U.S. Congress to lead an invasion of Iraq, asserting that Iraq was in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1441. With strong support from British P.M. Tony Blair, the Bush administration claimed that Sadam and his forces were in possession of weapons of mass destruction that posed a threat to U.S. security and that of allies including the U.K. and Australia. After investigation following the invasion, the U.S. led Iraq Survey Group concluded that Iraq had ended its nuclear, chemical and biological programs in 1991 and had no active programs at the time of the invasion, but that they intended to resume production if the Iraq sanctions were lifted. Although no active chemical weapons program was found, at least 17 U.S. troops and 7 Iraqi police officers were burned or wounded when chemical devices exploded. President Bush later said that the biggest regret of his presidency was 'the intelligence failure' in Iraq, while the Senate Intelligence Committee found in 2008 that his administration 'misrepresented the intelligence and the threat from Iraq'. The U.S. completed its withdrawal of military personnel in December 2011, during the ninth year of the war. The rise of ISIS means that the U.S. will send an army headquarters to Iraq for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the fundamentalist group. Another reason for the cover-up, according to The Times, was that five of the six chemical weapons encounters involved weapons designed by the U.S. '''Nothing of significance'' is what I was ordered to say,' said Jarrod Lampier, a now-retired Army major who was present when forces found 2,400 nerve agent rockets in 2006 - the largest chemical weapons discovery of the war. Soldiers were also loathe to report finding the caches as documenting chemical weapons added hours of extra work to their load. Chemical warfare specialists had to be called in, and waiting for them to arrive put coalition forces in dangerous positions. 'I could wait all day for tech escort to show up and make a chem round disappear, or I could just make it disappear myself,' one ex-soldier told The Times. The mustard shells could be put in with other explosives that needed to be destructed and then detonated. US Secretary of State John Kerry visits the former Berlin Wall crossing point Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin today . However, handling chemical weapons lead to many injuries, which were not taken seriously by military doctors at the time. Many explosive ordnance disposal personnel were not aware that the shells they were handling contained chemicals, believing them to be regular old artillery. At least 17 American military personnel and seven Iraqi police were sickened by poisons - usually sarin and mustard gases. Many of the shells would leak liquid during transportation, exposing the soldiers to the potentially-lethal fumes. Symptoms ranged from disorientation and nausea to blindness and huge, seething blisters. Jarrod Taylor, a former Army sergeant on hand for the destruction of mustard shells that burned two soldiers in his infantry company, joked of 'wounds that never happened' from 'that stuff that didn't exist'. 'I love it when I hear, ''Oh there weren't any chemical weapons in Iraq'',' he said. 'There were plenty.'","BBC reporter claims terror group has fired chemical weapons at warzone .

"Rangers will hold informal talks with the SFA board on Tuesday over the possibility of Mike Ashley significantly raising his stake at Ibrox. Ibrox chief executive Derek Llambias revealed the meeting at a stormy club AGM on Monday, which saw further complications emerge in the board’s fight to plug an £8million gap. A resolution to grant them power to issue new shares without first offering them to existing stakeholders was defeated – which the board admitted will ‘limit its options for future funding’. Mike Ashley currently owns an 8.92 per cent stake in Rangers . Ashley is still central to hopes of financial stability but the Newcastle United owner – who owns 8.92 per cent of Rangers - is currently limited to a 10-per-cent stake by an agreement made with the SFA in 2012. Their rules state that no individual can have influence at two clubs without the prior permission of the board. Rangers and Ashley are already facing Notices of Complaint from the governing body about alleged breaches of the existing agreement. Tuesday's talks are, however, being treated as completely separate from that disciplinary case, which will go before a Judicial Panel on January 27. It’s believed Rangers approached the SFA in September about the prospect of Ashley raising his stake to around 27 per cent but didn’t then follow up on a request for a detailed business case. The Sports Direct cannot own more than a 10 per cent stake in the club due to an agreement with the SFA . There has since been further contact between the two parties and now the SFA board, which was already due to meet, will hear from Llambias ahead of any formal request to alter the limit placed on the Sports Direct tycoon. The former Newcastle United managing director may argue that Ashley – who has already loaned Rangers £3m - is the only hope of avoiding further financial disarray in the New Year. Responding to a question about how the club intended to deal with the situation regarding Ashley and the SFA, Llambias told the AGM: ‘Due to the charge levelled against the club and Mike Ashley, we are now not able to comment on that. We are seeing the SFA tomorrow (Tuesday) and then we’ll have a clearer picture of what they are expecting of us.’ Derek Llambias could argue that Ashley is the only hope that Rangers have of securing financial stability . Former Rangers director Paul Murray believes Ashley must deliver a statement of intent about his plans for Ibrox. Speaking after the AGM, Murray said: ‘Mike Ashley has to come out and be clear about what he wants to do with the club. Are his interests Sports Direct or are they Rangers?’ The defeat to Resolution 9 on the AGM agenda – relating to the wider share issue - suggests one major shareholder voted against it, with fingers of blame being pointed behind the scenes last night. All three current PLC directors were re-elected but chairman David Somers polled only 61 per cent, substantially less than the backing delivered to Llambias and James Easdale.","Mike Ashley is only allowed to own up to a 10 per cent stake in Rangers .

"SNAPSHOTS: ENCOUNTERS WITH TWENTIETH CENTURY LEGENDS By Herbert Kretzmer (Robson Press £25) The cast list of this collection is sumptuous — great film stars in their glory days, legends of the boxing ring, disc jockeys, racing jockeys, writers of plays and unforgettable songs, and a few unclassifiable men who became as rich as Walt Disney and Paul Getty. What they had in common was being interviewed by the renowned journalist Herbert Kretzmer, who explains that his boyhood in a one-horse town in South Africa was lit up each week by a trip to the cinema, or ‘bioscope’ as it was called. It gave him a hunger to get among the Hollywood stars, and so he did — treating them as equals. By then he was in showbusiness, too, as a lyric writer of albums and musicals. With many hits to his credit, he finally struck gold by writing the English lyrics to Les Miserables. The renowned journalist Herbert Kretzmer had a hunger to get among the Hollywood stars, and so he did — treating them as equals . Some interviews are short, but his mere brush with Maurice Chevalier in his mean old age is enough to set the nerves jangling with dislike. So does the immature ignorance of a youthful Cliff Richard, who had toured South Africa without noticing that apartheid was a problem. ‘The coloured servants don’t really mind it. They get their food and board — why should they mind?’ he says. As Kretzmer observes, ‘an image caught on the run can reveal more than a studio portrait’. It is not only what his subjects say but the way Kretzmer frames the snapshot that is revealing. Many of the interviews were done in the Sixties. In that period, he and I saw each other most weekday nights during theatre intervals, as rival reviewers for Fleet Street newspapers. Kretzmer had a brush with Cliff Richard who toured South Africa without acknowledging that apartheid was a problem . We never discussed the show we were seeing — an unbreakable convention among critics, although actors believe that we conspire. So I have reason to respect Kretzmer’s shrewdness of eye and humorous sharpness of prose. In those days, before tape recorders, we interviewed using the Old Technology — a notebook and pencil, an observant eye and a good memory. Nowadays, especially on TV, interviewers are noisy, interrupting, pestering people with questions — drawing attention to themselves. A good interviewer gets past the persona that stars always have ready-prepared. He is looking for ore, and once he’s scented it, knows when to wait — giving his subjects confidence, to the point where they’ll confess what they usually keep hidden. A stunningly brilliant example of this is Kretzmer’s session with the notoriously hard nut to crack, Cary Grant. Invited to take a ride in Hyde Park in Grant’s Rolls-Bentley, Kretzmer notes how ‘indestructibly boyish’ the star looks in his 50s. But why did he walk out on so many wives? At one point Grant says mysteriously: ‘We spend our time getting away from mother only to return to mother.’ Kretzmer notes this opening. But he waits. Grant is given to ‘High Himalayan Silences’. He says that even the most dedicated mother does not return love consistently. ‘There are periods of rejection, so the child grows up afraid of love.’ Kretzmer notes: ‘He seemed to be talking about himself.’ Grant goes on: ‘Eventually you’re afraid to give yourself fully to the beautiful blast of love. When love walks in, most people walk out.’ Kretzmer lights a cigarette and waits. Grant continues: ‘I wouldn’t let myself feel love, and because of that I couldn’t give it. Every man’s first love is his mother. My own mother was brunette so I used to marry blondes.’ Cary Grant was a notoriously hard nut for Kretzmer to crack . These reflections are interrupted by the park-keeper tapping on the window: ‘Lady asks if she can take yer snap.’ Go ahead, says Grant — the lady was blonde. The ageless boy of 56 and the boy from the South African bush sit on companionably. Grant says he thinks he’s broken the patterns of blondes and failure. He drops Kretzmer off at his home. ‘I’m going to Bristol to see my mother. She’s 83’. In parting he adds: ‘I’m really getting to enjoy my mother’s company’, and glides away in his car. There are plenty more nuggets, often in a brief flash. J. Paul Getty talks ‘in a slow solemn undertone, like a family doctor preparing to give bad news to the relatives’. On the frequency of his divorces, he told Kretzmer: ‘A rich man’s wife begins to feel useless. Servants do all the work. And I couldn’t spare women a lot of time.’ Rex Harrison, too, found women dispensable. ‘They now want total independence, yet they still want to be taken care of, don’t they? They insist on careers but I don’t find career women particularly happy, do you? They’re taking on pressures they are not built to withstand. Soon they’ll be dying sooner than we do!’ At this Mr Harrison ‘chortled into his iced drink’. Marlene Dietrich would probably have agreed. ‘Men are stronger characters than women, not so muddled in their thinking. I have a brain more male than female,’ she told Kretzmer. Ever-genial David Niven, when asked if there was anything he disliked about himself, studied his nails and said: ‘I know exactly what I dislike. I am too busy trying to get everybody to like me. So I am thought shallow and artificial.’ He studied his nails some more. ‘Artificial . . . and shallow,’ he repeated softly, leaving us to wonder — was he? Ever-genial David Niven, when asked if there was anything he disliked about himself, studied his nails and said: ‘I know exactly what I dislike. I am too busy trying to get everybody to like me. So I am thought shallow and artificial.’ Perhaps the saddest piece is on Peter Sellers, the master impersonator. Kretzmer, who knew him, ‘or rather didn’t know him’, for 20 years, says: ‘He saw himself as an unfinished man who had been denied a definable personality. People wanted more from him than he could give, and nothing — and nobody — satisfied him for long.’ Throughout, Kretzmer remains a courteous, self-effacing observer of the games others play. I won’t say his book is unputdownable. Its attraction is that it is putdownable. It should be savoured a brandy glassful at a time — ideal for sipping at the bedside.","Herbert Kretzmer had a hunger to get among the Hollywood stars .

"A driver managed to escape alive after her VW Golf was almost completely crushed underneath an articulated lorry. The 27-year-old woman ended up under the HGV after her car was shunted by a skip lorry behind her in Colchester in Essex and pushed beneath the large lorry. But despite her car being almost entirely flattened, the woman was rescued and is believed to have escaped without life threatening or serious injuries. A female driver whose car was shunted with such a force it went beneath a lorry and was crushed managed to escape the crash in Colchester without life threatening injuries, the collision caused a five car pile-up . Her car was crushed to such an extent that other drivers at first did not realise VW was beneath the body of the articulated lorry, in between the tyres. The crash took place with such force that a Toyota Hilux and Seat Ibiza in front of the HGV were also damaged. It happened on the Braintree-bound carriageway of the A120 opposite the Red Lion pub in Little Tey, Colchester on Tuesday evening. Police closed the road in both directions between Marks Tey to Coggeshall for five-and-a-half hours. A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving, causing a serious injury collision and on suspicion of being under the influence of drink and drugs. He was being questioned at Colchester police station on Tuesday night. Minutes before the accident three vehicles had crashed and moved into a bus stop, when the five car collision took place . The crash took place after a skip appeared to shunt the VW with such a force it was pushed beneath the lorry . The 27-year-old woman was airlifted to hospital and police said it was astonishing she survived the crash . Stuart Hunt, who was exchanging details after he had been involved in a minor crash 50 yards away ten minutes earlier, was one of the first at the scene. He said: 'We called the police but we did not know there was a car in the middle until we went and had a look. 'The car was destroyed - I thought the driver was a gonner. The emergency services were brilliant, they were here in ten minutes.' The crash happened near the Red Lion pub, and its landlord John Murray described hearing a 'monumental thud.' Police said the skip shunted the car from behind, hitting it with such force two cars in front were damaged . The accident took place on the Braintree-bound carriageway of the A120 in Little Tey, Colchester . He described the car beneath the HGV as 'obliterated.' 'It had taken the top off and you could barely see the car,' he said. 'The lorries were touching.' Sgt Damon Bainbridge, crash investigator, said:  'For whatever reason, maybe for a car turning further off the road further up, traffic had slowed or stopped but the skip lorry did not stop in time.' He said it was surprising the victim of the crash, who was airlifted to Royal London Hospital, had not suffered life threatening or life changing injuries. 'It is extremely unlikely to get a survivor in a crash like this,' he added. 'If they did survive, we would expect them to have life threatening or life changing injuries. 'It goes to show what a difference the quality of vehicle construction can make and what else can I call it except luck.'","A VW Golf was completely crushed after it was shunted under large lorry .

"The couple who saved a newborn baby's life in Merced, California are planning to adopt the baby girl found abandoned in their apartment building's dumpster last week. Jimmy and Annette Alvarez found the little girl after hearing Jorge Miranda scream around 5:45am at the Sunnyside Apartment Complex last Thursday. Jimmy immediately wrapped the baby in his t-shirt and his wife warmed her up with her hands, which led the child to take a deep breath and come back to life. Police have since identified the baby's mother as a 13-year-old girl who is bound for Child Protective Services. Scroll down for video .

The Alvarezes, former foster parents who have 37 grandchildren and great-grandchildren, now plan to become parents again after filing papers to adopt the little girl they've named Milagro - Spanish for 'miracle'. Mr Alvarez described the heartbreaking moment he found baby Milagro to the Merced Sun-Star. Jorge Miranda was looking through the trash bin for cans and bottles early that morning when he found the hours-old baby under discarded pizza boxes and plastic trash bags. The Alvarezes heard the scream and came running to the trash area, where they found a confused and shocked Mr Miranda with the baby. Family man: Mr Alvarez pictured with one of his many great-grandchildren . 'He was shocked, he was scared,' Mr Alvarez said of Mr Miranda. 'The baby was lying in the corner of the dumpster, half naked, the umbilical cord hanging.' Alvarez wrapped the child in his shirt and his wife then held the baby until police arrived. He asked the paramedics if he could name the child 'Milagro' which means miracle. 'It was a miracle she was there; it was a miracle she was found. I’m just grateful it wasn't dumpster day.' Hospitals, fire stations, and police stations are 'Safe Surrender' stations where mother's may drop their babies less than three days old without any questions asked. 'We also have information available if someone drops a baby off and later wants them back,' said Billy Alcorn, acting battalion chief. Local  police eventually found the 13-year-old mother who admitted to abandoning the baby. She received medical treatment and doctors confirmed that she recently gave birth. The unidentified mother is currently in the county's care and will be transferred into the custody of Child Protective Services.

"A young underage girl was on a child protection watch list before she was picked up at Sydney Airport . Australian authorities have stopped an uncle and his 14-year-old niece from leaving Sydney for Lebanon due to fears the teenage girl would be forced into a prearranged marriage. Federal and State agencies swooped on the couple at Sydney Airport on Friday afternoon after a joint investigation revealed that the girl was departing for Lebanon for the purpose of a wedding - possibly linked to a terror organisation. It is understood the girl  was on an airport watch list for children at risk, and authorities acted when the pair triggered the alarm at Sydney Airport. Authorities have been put on high alert at international departure points in the wake of Islamic State extremists launching a social media recruitment campaign to lure young brides to wed terrorists. But a Department of Immigration and Border Protection spokeswoman told The Sunday Telegraph there was no suggestion that this girl was travelling to Lebanon for that specific reason. 'The government can confirm that an adult male and a female minor were prevented from boarding a flight at Sydney International Airport,' the spokeswoman said. 'The prevention from boarding was not counter-terror related.' She said the pair were  questioned and allowed to leave, but for privacy reasons could not provide more details. Scroll down for video . Middle Eastern terrorist groups have been behind a campaign to recruit young wives for marriage . The case of the young girl comes after a spokeswoman for the Immigrant Women's Health Service last week warned of ISIS's public appeal to lure wives to the Middle East. Dr Eman Sharobeem said the call for women and female children left Australian girls vulnerable of being sent overseas against their will. The NSW Family and Community Services Department, along with police, are the joint investigators for under-age marriage. A FACS spokeswoman said it relied on information from the community to report children at risk, but  can not discuss the details of specific cases for privacy reasons. Authorities swooped before the girl and her uncle departed for Lebanon . 'Legislation does not allow Family and Community Services to discuss the details of any cases that involve child protection matters,' she said. 'Regardless of whether or not a marriage has purportedly taken place, sexual relations with an underage person is a crime and will be dealt with as such by both FACS and NSW Police.' NSW Family and Community Services Pru Goward last year launched an investigation into the practice and wrote to Mr Morrison and other relevant senior ministers in relation to the case of a 12-year-old girl allegedly being married to a 26-year-old overseas student. Another 14-year-old avoided being smuggled out of the country by her parents to be wed after pleading with her school counsellor to intervene. In a separate case in June, 2012, a 14-year-old Iraqi girl returned to Australia pregnant. She said: 'Girls should have the right to a childhood free from abuse, or a marriage imposed upon them.' She also said all girls in Australia should have the opportunity to make her own choices, including marriage.","The girl was with her uncle when she was stopped on Friday .

"With Chelsea and Arsenal on the horizon, we’ll have a clearer idea about West Ham’s top-four credentials by the time those Christmas decorations are stored away for another year. Those daunting clashes, however, hold no fear for Hammers boss Sam Allardyce. ‘We challenge Chelsea and Arsenal on the back of what we’ve done up until now,’ said Allardyce. West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce is in a jovial mood for Christmas after his team's fantastic form . 92: The number of days since Leicester last won a game — the 5-3 victory against Manchester United in September. 12: The number of games Leicester have gone without a victory (two draws and 10 losses).2 The number of Premier League teams who have escaped relegation after being bottom of the table at Christmas (West Brom in 2004-05 and Sunderland 2013-14). -14: - Leicester’s goal difference is the joint worst in the league with Burnley. 17th: Leicester’s position in the table at Christmas in their last season in the Premier League (2003-04). 19.2: The number of shots, on average, Leicester concede per away game — the most in the league. 13.3: The number of fouls, on average, Leicester commit per game — the joint-highest in the league with Crystal Palace. ‘It eases the pressure on us, the fact we can go there and see if we can go and challenge ourselves against two of the big boys in this league and see if we can get any points off them. ‘We’ve earned the right to go to try to see if we can do that. As difficult as it might be, I think the lads are confident enough to think they may have the capabilities of doing it. ‘If we don’t, it’s not going to be too much of a knock back for us, because we know we can catch up by beating teams who are below us, like Leicester and teams like that, which we’ve done particularly well this year. ‘It’s a nice time, I think, for us to be playing Chelsea and Arsenal.’ Saturday’s comfortable win over Leicester — courtesy of goals from Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing — consolidated West Ham’s place in the top four going into the Boxing Day visit to Stamford Bridge. Time will tell if Allardyce can complete a huge turnaround in the club’s fortunes by securing Champions League football.

Allardyce (right) shares a joke with Leicester manager Nigel Pearson (left) West Ham were booed off by their own supporters, fed up by what they perceived as the manager’s long-ball tactics, following a victory against Hull in March. Allardyce looked certain to be sacked in the summer but owners David Sullivan and David Gold’s decision to stick with their manager has been vindicated. How the Hammers cope with the loss of Diafra Sakho, Alex Song and Cheikou Kouyate, who are expected to be called up for Africa Cup of Nations duty next month, could have a bearing on the club’s European ambitions. But for the moment, Allardyce is enjoying life in the upper echelons of the Premier League. ‘There was a time last season when the players felt that no matter what they did, we would get battered by people,’ said the former Bolton chief. ‘Everyone is going to have a bad spell; that is the Premier League — it happens to everyone. Downing (right) celebrates alongside Carroll (left) after putting West Ham two goals ahead . Goalkeeper Adrian makes a save to preserve his clean sheet as West Ham continued their form this season . West Ham and Allardyce will learn this week whether a work permit will be given Doneil Henry . ‘Obviously at this moment if we carry on as we are, we are predicted a top-four finish, but whether we will or we won’t is another matter.’ Meanwhile, West Ham will find out this week if they get a work permit they need to complete a £1.5million move for Canada centre back Doneil Henry.

"Joan Rivers died  of a therapeutic complication as a result of throat surgery. The New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner released the results of their investigation into the comedian's death today, saying that she died due to brain damage as a result of a lack of oxygen, which they call 'a predictable complication of medical therapy,' meaning her death is the result of a risk that is associated with her surgery. Rivers died in New York City on September 4 at the age of 81 following a minor throat procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy. Scroll down for video . Cause of death: Joan Rivers (above) died of therapeutic complication as a result of throat surgery it was revealed today . Legend: The comedian passed away on September 4 in an NYC hospital . The investigation reveals the exact cause to be 'anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation for evaluation of voice changes and gastroesophageal reflux disease.' Hypoxic arrest is caused by a drastic reduction in oxygen supply to the brain. That then leads to anoxic encephalopathy, which is brain damage due to lack of oxygen. The laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy refer to the diagnostic procedure Rivers was having performed at the time. Propofol, the drug Rivers was on while her operation was being performed, is used to induce or maintain anesthesia during surgery and is the same drug that caused the death of Michael Jackson when he overdosed on it back in 2009. And lastly, gastroesophageal reflux disease is why Rivers was having the surgery performed. Dr Gwen Korovin, Rivers' throat specialist, was one of the doctors in the room when the incident occurred. On the scene: Rivers' throat specialist, Dr. Gwen Korovin (above), was with the star when her surgery went wrong . Rivers was having throat surgery at Yorkville Endoscopy when complications occurred . The  report means that Rivers died when she stopped getting oxygen to her brain, said Manhattan gastroenterologist Dr. Jerome Waye, past president of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. 'That may have happened from a heart attack, or a stroke, or too much sedation,' said Waye, who has spoken with physicians from the Yorkville facility. Waye said speculation among New York physicians is that Rivers had a vocal cord lesion that was being biopsied when she had some sort of vocal cord spasm. 'No one really knows what happened, but the scuttlebutt is that she had a biopsy of a vocal cord lesion. That’s what it sounds like, that an ENT was there, took a biopsy for the lesion, and we don’t know what the connection is between that and her going off to the hospital is. There’s a big disconnect there – what happened between the biopsy, we don’t even know if she had the rest of the endoscopy – and the loss of oxygen to the brain?' Waye said such complications are uncommon. 'These are very, very rare complications,' Waye said. 'There are millions of endoscopic investigations done every day under propofol, and yet so infrequently do we see a situation like this.' He added, 'It’s unusual we just never see spasms of the vocal cords that would cause someone to have an anoxic encephalopathy.' Rivers was rushed to the Mount Sinai Hospital on August 28 after she stopped breathing as a result of serious complications during a routine throat procedure. She was put into a medically induced coma and then, two days later, placed on life support. Four days after that she passed away.","The New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner released the results of their investigation into the death of Joan Rivers today .

"Harrison Reed is called ‘Ray Donovan’ by his Southampton team-mates because he solves problems in central midfield. Donovan, the eponymous hero of an American television series, is the go-to problem-solver for Hollywood celebrities. Reed stamped his mark 17 minutes into his first Barclays Premier League start when he ran to the touchline to hustle the ball out of play. The simple act brought loud applause from the St Mary’s crowd. Youngster Harrison Reed is nicknamed 'Ray Donovan' for his ability to solve problems in midfield . The 19-year-old had an impressive game in his first Premier League start of his Southampton career . The Saints youngster's presence in front of the back line helped his side to victory against Everton . But for a 19-year-old he brought a certain maturity to his play in front of the back four. It was a demanding role but the red-headed Reed’s non-stop hustling and astute passing provided the foundation for Southampton to cruise to victory and end a run of five defeats. Team-mate Shane Long explained: ‘I call him Ray Donovan because he just cleans up in midfield. I was really impressed since the first day I came in. ‘It is hard to get a game with the quality we have in midfield, but two suspensions (Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama) and Jack Cork injured as well, have given him a chance and he took it. He was immense.’ Graziano Pelle scored his eighth Premier League goal for Southampton with his side's second of the day . Jose Fonte reels away as his shot is deflected into the Everton net by striker Romelu Lukaku . Everton were expected to mount a serious challenge for the top four this season but have struggled for form . An own goal from Romelu Lukaku and strikes by Graziano Pelle and Maya Yoshida won the game, but Reed was the hero in the shadows. Defensive midfield is hardly a role that youngsters dream of playing but Reed is making the best of his ability. ‘He is not the best technical player but showed unbelievable spirit and good character to win battles in midfield,’ said manager Ronald Koeman. ‘A young one in your team needs to be comfortable in the position he plays. He played in his best position, in front of the three centre backs and was comfortable. He was outstanding.’","Harrison Reed has been nicknamed after problem solver 'Ray Donovan'

"Scunnered. Not just a localised colloquial term to sum up the mood of Rangers fans watching their club pummelled and pilloried from all angles at the moment, but a fair enough way of describing exactly how Ally McCoist and the Ibrox board feel about each other. As a settlement is finalised to end a business relationship utterly lacking in mutual respect, Sportsmail examines how they reached this point — and what finally caused the façade of public co-operation to crumble. Ally McCoist has left Rangers, nine days after he offered his resignation to the club . Why Ally was fed up with Rangers . Redundancies to long-serving members of staff, not deemed crucial to the football department but seen by many as part of the fabric of Rangers, are cited as the trigger for McCoist’s decision to hand in his notice. If that was the final straw, though, it is fair to say that the spine of the dromedary was already near breaking long before the manager penned his farewell letter. Trying to compile a list of all the nonsense McCoist has had to deal with during his time at the helm is, quite frankly, a case of choosing what to leave out. So apologies if your ‘favourite’ scandal/farce/calamity isn’t included. Starting with the biggest bumps in the road first, the act of the club simply sliding into administration under the guidance of Craig Whyte — he of the garbled gabbling and, apparently, muddled mathematics — effectively killed off Rangers’ chances of winning the title in Ally’s first season at the helm. Rangers beat Livinstone 2-0 on Saturday, and sit second in the Championship table after 17 games . Oh sure, he had already seen his team blow a 15-point lead to be overtaken by Celtic, suggesting that they might have lost the race regardless. But the 10-point deduction did for any lingering chances. If plunging into insolvency was bad enough, the arrival of Charles Green’s consortium as ‘saviours’ would not have gone down well with a man who, it is understood, hoped to see any combination of Brian Kennedy, Dave King and the Blue Knights at the helm. When Green then fails to get his Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) accepted, forcing the club into liquidation, fans turned to McCoist as the one man they could trust. The one man who famously refused to walk away. Rangers fans have shown great support for McCoist in the past, with his loyalty a key feature . Forced to start all over again in the bottom tier of Scottish football, then hit with a transfer embargo that gave him 42 days to rebuild a decimated squad, McCoist was faced with the perfect storm of managerial crises. Any one of which would have been a good enough excuse to call it a day, just over a year into the job. Since then, he has shrugged aside direct public criticism from the increasingly buffoon-like Green, offered his vocal support to an ever-changing cast of chief executives, some of which he might actually have trusted, and agreed to cut his — admittedly excessive — salary by almost 50 per cent. McCoist has gone through several changes of owners, with Mike Ashley now holding the power at the club . Finally, as those one-off bad results in the cup competitions started to cluster together in a Championship season that must end with promotion, came the whispering campaign, the blame, the cuts. From dealing with all that had come his way with fortitude and, for the most part, good cheer, the lawyered-up McCoist, who stuck to the ‘no-comment’ line when pressed on his resignation on the Friday night before his team lost at Queen of the South, looked like a man at the end of his tether. Scunnered. Why Rangers grew fed up with Ally . How do you sack a manager who has won back-to-back titles by record margins? A head coach who was already a club legend as a player — and assistant to the most popular gaffer in Rangers’ modern history? Well, those who make even a half-hearted attempt at balancing the books start by calculating what keeping him in place would have cost the club. And whether they can possibly survive without returning to Scottish football’s top flight at the first attempt. Despite throwing away that huge lead over Celtic in season 2011-12, McCoist became effectively untouchable when he took on the mantle of front man, public face and spiritual leader to Rangers fans during the administration crisis. Rangers boss Ally McCoist looked in high spirits during Saturday's win despite recent difficulties at Ibrox . Within 24 hours of the club sliding into insolvency, Super Ally gained instant legend status when, asked if he was considering his own future, he declared: ‘At Rangers, we don’t do walking away.’ Even the most ardent brand of hero worship only lasts so long, however. If that first season was just about winning the title, subsequent cup failures began to ebb away at confidence in the former striker who had been such an integral part of Walter Smith’s successful second coming at Ibrox. In August 2013, they lost 2-1 away to Forfar in the first round of the League Cup. If that was painful, their loss to Raith Rovers in the Ramsdens Cup Final in April 2014 was seen by many as a turning point for the manager’s popularity. Defeat to Raith Rovers in the Ramsdens Cup Final last season was a turning point for McCoist . Taken on its own, last month’s disaster in the Petrofac Training Cup at Alloa — blowing a 2-0 lead to lose three late goals against part-time opposition — would have been enough reason for a lot of fans to consider his time was up. The fact that yet another cup howler came during an underwhelming Championship campaign, with home-and-away losses to leaders Hearts and a defeat to Hibs at Ibrox already on the cards, irrevocably tipped the balance against McCoist. Suddenly, every aspect of his management has been open to question, from a signing policy that saw senior professionals poached from top-flight clubs, to their subsequent failure to blow away lower-league opposition. With the prospect of automatic promotion slipping ever further out of sight, the board’s hand was only stayed by a lack of cash needed to pay off the manager. McCoist’s resignation brought the subject to a head. Leaving the cash-strapped board thoroughly, well, scunnered.","Ally McCoist left Rangers on Sunday, after resigning last week .

"A British performer who penned a book about his experience of sexual abuse has been temporarily banned from publishing it because his ex-wife is worried their young son will read it. In a case which has been shrouded in secrecy, the woman, known only as BHM, successfully obtained an injunction to stop her ex-husband, known as MLA, publishing the book until the issue has been decided at trial. Media lawyers and publishers have warned the case - known only as OPO v MLA -  could set a dangerous precedent for freedom of expression and fear it could extend privacy laws 'by the back door'. A British performer who wrote about his experience of sexual abuse has been stopped from publishing his book after his wife sought an injunction from the Court of Appeal, . The artist - said to be well-known in his performing arts field - argued that his right to freedom of expression was palpable because he had been the victim of such serious abuse as a schoolboy. But lawyers for his ex-wife claimed their son was particularly vulnerable and would be hugely disturbed if he ever read parts of his father's work. In a further twist, the veil of secrecy covering the case means those involved can only be known by their initials. The artist's exact trade cannot be revealed either. The court even went to lengths to describe the woman and her son as living in 'Ruritania' in order to conceal her identity. The performer told the Guardian: 'Imagine someone from Rotherham being told they can't come forward and talk about what happened to them as a result of legal action.' The startling case emerged after BHM brought proceedings on behalf of her son, who has Asperger's Syndrome and attention deficit disorder. Experts warn the case could have a devastating effect on freedom of expression for writers . The case was brought to court under a historic case dating back to 1897 which established 'the intentional infliction of mental shock' in common law. The court rejected BHM's claims that the information would be a 'misuse of private information' or that the whole book should be banned. But it did grant a temporary injunction, ruling that the balance of the boy's rights versus those of his father should be decided at full trial. MLA's solicitor Tamsin Allen told the paper that the decision threatened to extend privacy law by the back door, adding that there could be 'serious implications'. And Jo Glanville, director of English PEN, which campaigns for the rights of writers, told MailOnline: 'I think it is always worrying when a book is potentially banned. 'We have to question very carefully the basis on which this is taking place. We do not expect this to happen in a democracy that has a very fundamental support for freedom of speech.' She added that it could be a slippery slope, allowing others to claim they are 'distressed' by other people's work. She said: 'If it is possible for an individual to stop a book being published, on the grounds it will cause distress to a family relative, you can imagine that it might be applied further to many other cases - particularly memoirs, or even fiction that might be based on real events and in which people can identify themselves. 'It is incredibly rare for books to be banned. But what I can see as potentially happening is very worrying. When it happens we really have to examine and questions and resist.' Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of the campaign group Index on Censorship, said: 'What would concern us is the potential for this to be used by other people as a way of getting books censored on the grounds that it causes distress. 'I think that leads a very wide area for interpretation.' She added that attempting to ban something from publication over the fear it could become readily-available on the internet also sets a dangerous precedent. The 'intentional infliction of mental distress' was established in a famous English tort case called Wilkinson V Downton. Thomas Wilkinson was the landlord of the Albion public house in Limehouse. A regular customer of the public house, known as Mr Downton, decided to play a practical joke on Wilkinson's wife. When Mr Wilkinson went to see the races in Harlow, he left his wife to manage the house. Mr Downton approached Mrs Wilkinson and told her that her husband had been seriously injured in an accident - which was not true. Mr Downton told Mrs Wilkinson that he had suffered two broken legs and that he was lying at The Elms in Leytonstone. He told her that she should go to him and bring two pillows to carry him home. Mrs Wilkinson argued that the joke was a shock to her nervous system, causing her to vomit and her hair to turn white.  Mrs Wilkinson successfully sued. The most famous example of a book threatening to be banned was in the case of Spycatcher. In 1988, the British Government lost its long-running battle to stop the publication of the controversial book which was written by former secret service agent, Peter Wright. The court ruled the media could publish extracts from the former MI5 officer's memoirs, because any damage to national security had already been done by its publication abroad.

"The Tottenham Hotspur fans sang Harry Kane’s name loudly as he was substituted in the 84th minute, once victory over Burnley was all but assured. ‘He scores when he wants,’ they chanted in acknowledgement of the striker heading in his 14th goal in 23 appearances. He shook hands with manager Mauricio Pochettino and warmly embraced his replacement, Roberto Soldado, the £26million signing who was once backed to fill the gaping chasm left by Gareth Bale’s departure but who has failed to live up to that billing. Harry Kane scored his fourteenth goal in 23 appearances when Tottenham met Burnley on Saturday . Front man Kane said that he is setting his sights on scoring 20 goals for his club this season . The 21-year-old striker is mobbed by his Spurs team-mates following his goal at White Hart Lane . Kane's deadliness in front of goal manager means he is becoming invaluable for boss Mauricio Pochettino . Instead it is the 21-year-old from Walthamstow, a product of the academy system, who looks most likely to make up the goal deficit left in the Welshman’s wake. His confidence is soaring after scoring in each of his last three games and Kane believes he can be the 20-goal-a-season man Spurs have been searching for. Burnley again named an entirely British-born starting XI for Saturday’s Premier League game at Tottenham. The last team to do so in the Premier League were Blackpool against Manchester United on the final day of the 2010-11 season. ‘My first target was 10 goals and I reached that,’ said Kane, ‘My next target is 20 goals, so six to go.’ While Soldado admitted to being ashamed hearing Spurs fans sing his name even as he failed to justify his hefty price tag, boyhood Spurs fan Kane was delighted, recalling cheering his own heroes. ‘It’s great to hear them sing my name, like when I came off the pitch today,’ he said. ‘I used to sing the name of Teddy Sheringham, he was a big idol of mine, and Robbie Keane. ‘It can only spur you on. You can only do your best for the fans. If they are singing your name it always feels good.’ Erik Lamela scored with a sublime strike to give Tottenham the lead for the second time against Burnley . With Soldado misfiring, however, Spurs have stepped up their interest in West Bromwich Albion’s £25m-rated striker Saido Berahino after shelving a move for Jay Rodriguez. The Saints striker remains a target for Pochettino, but the delay in his return from a knee injury has forced Spurs into reassessing their January plans. It was current top man Kane, though, who put Spurs in front in the 21st minute on Saturday with a header from a Nacer Chadli cross. His effort was cancelled out on 27 minutes by Ashley Barnes’s stunning strike, which sailed into the roof of the net. Erik Lamela executed a similarly spectacular strike eight minutes later, which eventually sealed all three points for the home side. It stoked the fires for Spurs on the back of a win over Swansea last week and a 4-0 League Cup thrashing of Newcastle. Roberto Soldado has failed to impress for the north London side since joining the club last August . Ashley Barnes (centre) pulled Burnley level against Tottenham with a brilliant strike from range . Kane claims his rise shows that young English talent can prevail even in the mega-rich Premier League with all its foreign imports.‘Sometimes young English players who come through the ranks don’t always get the chance at the top level,’ he said. ‘I have been fortunate enough to get a chance and I’ve been able to take it. So it proves you don’t always have to buy players.’ Pochettino seems to have found a settled starting 11 who he claims have bought into his philosophy of pressing football. It has been said that players need two hearts to play for the Argentine, such is the work ethic he demands. Kane added: ‘Christmas is normally a time where teams get tired but you can see we’re really stepping it up.’","Against Burnley Harry Kane scored his 14th goal in 23 Spurs appearances .

"The Rangers board will face the wrath of the Ibrox support when it appears before the club's Annual General Meeting on Monday. The shareholder summit takes place at the home of the Glasgow giants at 10.30am and is certain to be a stormy affair.

David Somers (right) is facing re-election to the board at the Annual General Meeting on Monday morning . But with Easdale's brother Sandy - the football board chairman - in control of a quarter of the club's shares and also aligned with investor Mike Ashley, that should be a mere formality. However, with the club no nearer to financial security than they were when the directors were booed and heckled prior to last year's AGM, they will be under pressure to explain how they plan on saving the club from another collapse. In the time since that last explosive AGM, Ashley has grabbed control of the club, forcing both chief executive Graham Wallace and director Philip Nash to quit. The Newcastle owner - who holds an 8.92 per cent stake in the Glasgow giants - is now pulling the strings from behind. It is unclear whether Rangers manager McCoist will be in attendance at the meeting at Ibrox . Derek Llambias has been appointed as the non-executive director at Rangers . The £3million loan he handed the club gave him the right to hand-pick two directors and so far he has installed Llambias onto the board and ordered chairman David Somers to appoint him Wallace's successor as chief executive. But Rangers are still dangerously short of cash and need £8.3million before April 1 just to stay afloat. According to reports, billionaire Sports Direct tycoon Ashley is ready to underwrite a share issue which could prove the answer to the club's cash crisis - but that will only land the club in further hot water with the Scottish Football Association. Hampden chiefs have already handed Rangers and Ashley a notice of complaint as they investigate the 'dual ownership' aspect of the St James' Park owner's Ibrox involvement.

'(Jurgen) Klopp is having a bad time this season, but someone of his calibre is needed. He changes his tactics and has been in the Champions League before.' 'Roma's Rudi Garcia is another good manager. Wenger will have a say in who is brought in. He built the club up, won trophies and oversaw the new stadium.' The north Londoners are sixth in the Premier League table, 12 points adrift of leaders Chelsea and four points away from a Champions League spot. Arsene Wenger has been criticised by some Arsenal fans, but they need to be careful what they wish for . Kieran Gibbs had his head in his hands at full-time on Sunday after Arsenal squandered another lead to draw . Arsenal only have Mathieu Flamini fit as a 'proper' defensive midfielder and he is a constant disciplinary risk . Contrarily, as Wenger's fellow countryman Garcia continues to transform his team into serious title contenders, Roma currently sit second in Serie A three points behind last season's champions Juventus. With the January transfer window just around the corner, Parlour was also at hand to reveal who he thought Arsenal should bring in to improve their chances of Champions League qualification. 'Winston Reid has been mentioned, but I'm not sure he's the winner and a good player. 'For midfield, I would go for (Morgan) Schneiderlin if you can get him. He's at a good age. Lots of players are linked. '(Sami) Khedira would have been great. Players that have played in big games won't be phased by anything. Schneiderlin hasn't, but I can see him improving.'","Ray Parlour: Rudi Garcia would be a good successor to Arsene Wenger .

"The footage is grainy and the commentary dated, but the significance of the event should not be underestimated. In a clip preserved by British Pathe, Wolverhampton Wanderers, champions of England, take on the mighty Honved — and win. December 13 marks the 60th anniversary of that Molineux match — played under a new kind of floodlight, which changed the shape of European football. In front of 55,000 fans, with many more at home absorbed by a rare televised contest, Stan Cullis’s side came from two goals down to beat a team boasting six Hungarians who a year earlier had vanquished England 6-3 at Wembley. Victory for Wolves restored national pride but, more lastingly, provided the catalyst for today’s Champions League. That winter night in 1954 also played a pivotal role in the careers of Gordon Banks and George Best, and featured a cameo from a 15-year-old Ron Atkinson. Wolves beat Honved 3-2 at Molineux in December 1954 in one of the most famous games in their history . Stan Cullis' team came from 2-0 down to beat Ferenc Puskas and Co in front of 60,000 fans at Molineux . WOLVES . (3-2-5) Bert Williams . Eddie Stuart . Billy Wright . Bill Shorthouse . Bill Slater .

Nandor Banyai . Laszlo Budai . Sandor Kocsis . Ferenc Machos . Ferenc Puskas . Zoltan Czibor . The Honved game marked the culmination of a series of friendlies against great sides from around the world, with Wolves previously beating Racing Club of Buenos Aires and Spartak Moscow. ‘Champions of the World’ is what Cullis was reported to have called his team, although old Daily Mail clippings show he subsequently denied saying that. Such stories are still being discovered, which explains why a project has been launched to record the game’s impact for ever. Aided by the Heritage Lottery Fund, Wolves fan Mike Crump is in the process of putting together a book and DVD, as well as making contributions to the National Football Museum. His dad celebrated his 10th birthday by watching the BBC’s broadcast of the 3-2 win. Crump was at Molineux last Saturday alongside former England centre half Ron Flowers, one of only three surviving Wolves players from the match, to unveil the shirt worn by striker Roy Swinbourne — brought forward, after an appeal, by a woman who had won it years earlier in a raffle. ‘It’s very much of its era but using a type of silk material, specially commissioned by Stan Cullis for these internationals,’ explains Crump. ‘They were handmade by local seamstresses. Cullis had little bulbs put in the linesmen’s flags so fans could see offside decisions and it made Wolves players look like glow-worms.’ Matches under floodlights were rare in those days, but the game’s influence accelerated calls for European competition. L’Equipe editor Gabriel Hanot wrote a piece in the French newspaper shortly after the Wolves victory. Betty Swinbournewith her husband Roy’s shirt at Wolves museum, where they have a section for the game . The programme from the game at Molineux in 1954 (left) and a fan's souvenir (right) ‘No, Wolverhampton are not yet the “world champion of clubs”,’ ran the headline. ‘But L’Equipe launches the idea of a European club championship... whose realisation would be new and more sensational than a European championship of national teams.’ Hanot wrote that until Wolves had travelled to Budapest or faced AC Milan and Real Madrid, they could not claim any global or continental supremacy. But UEFA came on board and the following season the European Cup was born. It was the Honved match, against the ‘Magical Magyars’ Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis and Zoltan Czibor, which sparked it all: a mystical night in the Black Country remembered fondly by Flowers, now 80 years old. Early goals by Kocsis and Ferenc Machos reinforced the belief that Honved were invincible, before a soft penalty award allowed Johnny Hancocks to convert from the spot. Swinbourne headed Wolves level after 76 minutes before hammering home the winner 90 seconds later. ‘It was exciting. They were special times,’ says Flowers. ‘It was a novelty, playing under lights.’ The towering pylons and halogen bulbs had been installed in September 1953 at a cost of £25,000 under instruction from Cullis. ‘It was as if an electric fuse reached all the way round the ground,’ Cullis said afterwards. L'Equipe said that Wolves were not 'champions of the world' and called for a European club competition . Hungary had beaten England 7-1 in Budapest in March 1954 and national captain Billy Wright was in the Wolves line-up hoping for revenge. ‘It was an opportunity to test ourselves,’ says Flowers. ‘We had seen how good they were. Billy didn’t need to say anything about it. But we were confident. We had a 100 per cent record at home.’ Wolves were helped by the actions of Atkinson, then an apprentice, before kick-off. ‘Stan Cullis had us watering the pitch then rolling it while it was bucketing with rain,’ says Atkinson. ‘Honved went 2-0 up playing this one-touch passing game, but all of a sudden they couldn’t manipulate the ball and kept getting stuck. ‘Wolves were famous for their power game, long passing even though they had great players, and eventually overhauled them.’ Flowers reveals: ‘All our training was concentrated on building leg muscles. But we did a lot of work with benches and running up and down the terraces. Stan felt that our opponents would tire. What with the leather ball and the water that it gathered, you had to really belt it to move it.’ Only the second half was on the BBC, but watching back home were impressionable youngsters by the name of Best and Banks. Wolves have a section at their museum dedicated to one of their most famous victories at Molineux . George Best supported Wolves as a boy and was in awe of winger Peter Broadbent . Best, then just eight and in Belfast, was a Wolves fan in awe of winger Peter Broadbent. In his autobiography he tells how he would kick a ball outside his neighbour’s house minutes before kick-off to prompt an invitation. ‘I was in the house like a shot but the next time Wolves were on the television we would play the whole charade again,’ Best wrote. Banks, a 16-year-old Chesterfield apprentice, was inspired by goalkeeper Bert Williams. He too watched next door to home. ‘I thought Wolves would be lucky to get away with a 6-0 thrashing,’ Banks recalls. ‘I watched in awe as Bert Williams pulled out all the stops throughout the half. After the match I ran straight home to tell my dad that every penny of my pocket money was going to be spent watching him from now on. ‘There were no goalkeeping coaches in those days, see, so you had to learn by your own mistakes and by watching other keepers.’ The nucleus of the line-up that night against Honved went on to carry Wolves to the majority of their successes in the 1950s — two more titles and an FA Cup. ‘Everyone talks about the Honved team and rightly so,’ says Flowers. ‘But we did have some players. People overlook that. ‘To us, at the time, we enjoyed the matches. But who would have known what it would turn into? ‘There was a wonderful atmosphere in our town after that. I was told that thousands of people packed into the pubs and started partying. ‘It was an absolute privilege to be involved in what many people might say is the greatest sporting moment in Wolverhampton’s history.’ Anyone with recollections of the Honved match or any of the floodlit international friendlies at Molineux between 1953 and 1957, please write to: Our Voice CIC, Champions of the World Project, 29 Trident Drive, Langley Green, Oldbury, B68 8HW or email Mike Crump at mikec.ourvoice@gmail.com .","Wolves beat Honved 3-2 in front of 60,000 fans at Molineux in 1954 .

"England saw their Champions Trophy title hopes extinguished by Germany after suffering a 2-0 quarter-final defeat at the tournament in India. Olympic gold medallists Germany scored late in the second and fourth quarters, through Moritz Furste and Christopher Ruhr, to set up a semi-final against Australia in Bhubaneswar on Saturday. Bobby Crutchley's England side had decent second-half chances to get back on level terms, but an equaliser was beyond them, and Ruhr killed off the match with a 57th-minute close-range finish. German player Benedikt Furk dives to stop the ball as England's Nick Catlin watches on . Alexandre de Paeuw of Germany is challenged by Ashley Jackson of England . Germany took the lead on the stroke of half-time when Furste struck home into the top right of the net from a penalty corner. They had an opportunity to double their advantage midway through the third quarter but Pilt Arnold's driven cross from the left sped across goal, with Mats Grambusch unable to cash in. England looked like levelling in the 49th minute but amid a scramble somehow Germany kept the ball from crossing the line, with goalkeeper Nicolas Jacobi saving from Barry Middleton and Adam Dixon also lurking.

The reality TV star has unveiled and modelled her new AW14 collection, which she says  definitely takes a step away from classic ‘Essex style’ and a step towards the catwalk. With bold prints, strong lines and mesh detailing, Amy’s new collection takes inspiration from the AW14 runways. Scroll down for video .

Speaking about her new range, the 24-year-old told MailOnline: ‘This season is so different as I’ve really embraced the trends and moved away from my comfort zone. I also have more of a diverse range of prices as well as styles making more affordable pieces starting from £39.99, as well as designing for all shapes and sizes. 'My Christmas collection is going to be amazing, I shot it the other day and let’s just say it’s very Hollywood glamour and red carpet - perfect for the Christmas party with someone special.’ Autumn marks a busy couple of months for Amy as she is set to release a new capsule range in collaboration with high street giant Dorothy Perkins, her newly eponymous fragrance, her fake tan range and her new nightwear collection, which will be hitting the shelves in the next couple of weeks.

I get so involved with everything - that’s probably the reason why my tan took almost two years to make. I am too much of a perfectionist.' Amy even says her selective nature is not solely business-centred: ‘I’m quite picky with men. I am so busy at the moment with everything I’m doing but I definitely am starting to think about love. 'I do want marriage and kids down the line - just right now I’m so manic and focused on my career. I’ve been on a couple of dates but nothing serious. I am definitely single!

"One of Australia's top criminal prosecutors is considering quitting her job in response to what she says is a baseless corruption investigation targeting her and her son. NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen, SC, best known for prosecuting pack rapists and paedophiles, is devastated by the effect of the investigation on her family and may quit her distinguished career. 'The attack on me through my children is the last intolerable straw,' Ms Cunneen told Daily Mail Australia. 'After 38 years in the service of our state.' Asked if that meant should would consider quitting, the 55-year-old mother-of-three said 'yes'. NSW deputy senior Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen is considering quitting over a corruption investigation into a car crash involving her son's girlfriend . Sophia Tilley was involved in a car accident at Willoughby on May 31. Her boyfriend Stephen Wyllie is the son of Crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen, SC. Ms Cunneen and Mr Wylie are accused of counselling Ms Tilley to face chest pain at the crash site. Margaret Cunneen has had a distinguished 38-year career in public service. She is considering quitting due to allegations she and her son attempted to pervert the course of justice in relation to a car accident involving her son's girlfriend. The Independent Commission Against Corruption is investigating whether Ms Cunneen and her son Stephen Wyllie, 26, advised Mr Wyllie's girlfriend Sophia Tilley to fake chest pains to avoid being breath tested after a car crash on May 31. Daily Mail Australia can reveal ICAC investigators seized the mobile telephones of Ms Cunneen, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley in unannounced morning raids at their respective homes two months after the accident, on July 30. Until that day, none of the trio was aware of any investigation into events following the crash. Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were subsequently called to private ICAC hearings in August. Ms Tilley, 25, was driving Ms Cunneen's Ford Mondeo when she was hit by another vehicle in Willoughby, on Sydney's north shore, on May 31. The Mondeo was knocked onto its side and Ms Tilley was trapped in her seat belt for some time. Daily Mail Australia understands once Ms Tilley was freed from the vehicle she called her boyfriend Mr Wyllie, who called his father Greg Wyllie. Mr Wyllie snr then told Ms Cunneen. Ms Tilley, who has breast implants, reported experiencing chest pain at the scene. There was some fear the implants may have ruptured. 'The attack on me through my children is the last intolerable straw.' Margaret Cunneen may quit her job as deputy senior Crown prosecutor . Deputy senior Crown prosecutor is accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice. She denies any wrongdoing and does not know who has been allegations against her . The two Wyllies arrived at the accident scene on foot. By the time Ms Cunneen arrived by car Ms Tilley was in an ambulance. She was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital where a blood test showed no alcohol in her system. Ms Tilley was not at fault in the accident. The Mondeo was a write-off. None of those at the crash scene knew of any investigation until ICAC officers executed simultaneous warrants on July 31 at the home of Ms Cunneen and that of Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley. Each of their mobile telephones was seized. Ms Cunneen has successfully prosecuted paedophiles Robert 'Dolly' Dunn, Colin Fisk and Phillip Bell as well as pack rapist Bilal Skaf and his gang of thugs. Despite, or because, of her accomplishments, she has been criticised by some defence lawyers for being too close to crime victims. In late 2012, Ms Cunneen was appointed to preside over a special commission of inquiry into allegations of police interference in child sex abuse cases in the Catholic Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle. The day before the accident she had delivered her report to the then Governor, Dame Marie Bashir. Ms Cunneen is unsure what happened in the two months between the accident and her phone being seized to initiate an investigation but believes the inquiry was sparked by a ""malicious complaint"" from someone out to damage her reputation. She has stood aside from her job pending the outcome of the investigation. In August, Mr Wyllie and Ms Tilley were called before ICAC for private hearings. Again, the matter seemed to be stalled until Mr Wyllie, Ms Tilley and Ms Cunneen were served with summonses to appear before a public hearing on Wednesday night. Prosecutor Margaret Cunneen says she may quit her job over ICAC's investigation into allegations she counselled her son Stephen Wyllie's girlfriend Sophia Tilley to face chest pains after a car accident . The following day ICAC announced it would hold public hearings as part of what it is calling Operation Hale. The hearings would examine ""allegations that on 31 May 2014 Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen SC and Stephen Wyllie, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, counselled Sophia Tilley to pretend to have chest pains, and that Sophia Tilley, with the intention to pervert the course of justice, did pretend to have chest pains, to prevent investigating police officers from obtaining evidence of Ms Tilley's blood alcohol level at the scene of a motor vehicle accident"". The public hearing is set for three days, staring on November 10, when the commission is expected to hear from police and ambulance officers who attended the crash as well as members of the public who were present at the scene. Daily Mail Australia can reveal that since the announcement of the public hearing a new witness to accident has come forward stating she heard and saw ""nothing untoward"" at the crash scene. Ms Cunneen has received widespread support from prominent Australians, particularly in the legal community. The architect of the ICAC, Gary Sturgess, has described the investigation as 'appalling'. 'That’s a joke, really that’s a joke,' Mr Sturgess told The Daily Telegraph. 'If that is the best they have got to do then frankly they should be handing some money back. It’s appalling.' Former premier Nick Greiner, who set up the ICAC in 1989, has also criticised the corruption watchdog's investigation into Ms Cunneen for straying beyond its 'core task'. Mr Greiner told The Sydney Morning Herald he had a 'sneaking view' that if Ms Cunneen had a lower profile 'I doubt this would have happened'.","Margaret Cunneen, SC, has successfully prosecuted some of the country's worst pack rapists and paedophiles .

"Stewart Downing is in a happy place right now. The West Ham attacker scored his third goal of the season to earn a well-deserved point and prompted manager Sam Allardyce to renew calls for his inclusion with England. Allardyce was not best pleased with the England medical staff when they gave Downing an injection to get him through the first half of last month’s 3-1 win against Scotland. But his poor showing that night should not preclude future involvement, says his boss. Stewart Downing eqalised for West Ham at the Stadium of Light and the match finished 1-1 on Saturday . Sam Allardyce believes there aren't too many playing at the same level as Downing in the Premier League . Downing played for England against Scotland in a friendly win at Celtic Park in November . ‘He shouldn’t have played for England because he had been injected after getting a problem with his knee,’ he said. ‘It didn’t do him any favours as he wasn’t 100 per cent fit. I don’t think anyone should judge Stewie on what happened for 45 minutes against Scotland. ‘I think he should get the opportunity to go again and if he plays like he did (on Saturday) then there are not too many playing as well as Stewart Downing at the moment in the Premier League.’ The player himself believes he and the Hammers – currently in fourth – are headed for European football. ‘I haven’t enjoyed my football as much as this since I was at Aston Villa,’ he said. ‘It’s a very similar feel to Villa, the same sort of team - counter-attacking with pace and power. There is a good dressing room where everyone chips in. You can see we’re playing with confidence. ‘Villa finished in the top six and if we keep playing the way we are, so can we. We’ve got a hell of a chance.’ Downing, then, is looking towards a bright future. For Poyet, the outlook is somewhat bleak. Downing has been in fine form this sean and he stroked home the Hammers' equaliser . Gus Poyet is frustrated that Sunderland failed to sign players who can make the difference last summer . In contrast to the buoyant Downing, Sunderland boss Gus Poyet confessed that he was not enjoying himself. Not only that, he admitted that perhaps he isn’t the man to bring about a change of fortune, even forecasting a campaign of boredom in the months ahead. In short, Poyet is frustrated; frustrated with a side which lacks imagination and verve, frustrated that the club – led by sporting director Lee Congerton - have failed to provide him with players who can make the difference. ‘I want to do better and I want people to feel better. I am not enjoying this,’ said the Uruguayan, whose side have now drawn 10 of their 16 matches this season. ‘I enjoy it when I win, but when I draw too many I don't enjoy it. Maybe the problem is me, it is my character. Maybe it is not possible. Maybe we will need to wait three years (before we start winning). ‘The easiest way to solve all these problems is to get a player who can make the difference on his own. We don’t have one at the moment. Unless someone wins player of the month like Connor Wickham and Adam Johnson did last season, it is going to be boring draws all the time.’ Jordi Gomez slotted in after James Tomkins had fouled Adam Johnson in the penalty area after 22 minutes . Poyet says he is not enjoying himself and does not want to be drawing every week . Jozy Altidore missed a superb chance for the hosts and has been urged to forget about it by Steven Fletcher . January, you feel, could be a make-or-break month for the disenchanted South American. He started with USA striker Jozy Altidore on Saturday, the £6.5million flop who had scored once in 41 Premier League appearances. Make that 42. He was guilty of a glaring miss when swiping at fresh air three yards from an open goal to extend his top-flight drought to one year and one week. ‘It could have changed the game,’ said Steven Fletcher, the man left out at Altidore’s expense. ‘But it happens to all of us – he’s got to forget about it quickly.’ The score was 1-1 at the time, the outstanding Stewart Downing having cancelled out Jordi Gomez’s penalty, awarded when Adam Johnson dived under minimal contact from James Tomkins.","Stewart Downing scored for West Ham in 1-1 draw against Sunderland .

"Just two weeks ago David Warner rushed to Phillip Hughes’ aid after he received the blow that so tragically cost the young Australian batsman his life. So it seemed only fitting that it was Warner who provided the perfect tribute to Hughes with an emotionally charged century on day one of the rearranged first Test against India in Adelaide. Warner was quick to dedicate the hundred to Hughes, saying: ‘This is probably going to be the best (century) of my career. That’s going to stick with me for the rest of my life. VIDEO Scroll down for David Warner: I had gut feeling my little mate Hughes was with me . Australia batsman lofts his helmet to the sky after scoring a century on the first day against India . Warner was clearly emotional after reaching his ton and was embraced by captain Michael Clarke . ‘I just had a gut feeling that my little mate was down the other end with me the whole time, from ball one.’ Before the match, players, management and match officials lined up in front of a large white 408 — Hughes’ Baggy Green number — painted on to the pristine outfield while a tribute played on the big screen. Players wore black armbands, sported 408 on the chests of their playing shirts, and stood shoulder to shoulder to honour their mate. They also joined in 63 seconds of applause for the 25-year-old, who was 63 not out when struck by a bouncer from Sean Abbott two weeks ago. ‘The initial part before the game started, my emotions took over and it was quite challenging,’ admitted Warner. ‘I came off to try to regroup a little bit, then I just played with my instincts. ‘The adrenaline was pumping and I slowly pulled it in a little bit. And I knew I had to, to survive.’ Warner punches a ball through the covers as he raced to a poignant century . ‘The hardest point of the day for me was when I was on 63,’ he said. ‘It was such a horrific incident and a rare incident that, in the back of my mind, even though a spinner was bowling, just being on that number, I felt it wasn’t right. ‘I just wanted to try and get past that. Michael (Clarke) asked me at the other end if I was OK, and I was. I had to step away for a couple of seconds, just to get my thoughts and my processes back.’ Warner duly found those processes and was already removing his helmet as he jogged the single that took him to three figures midway through the afternoon. He kissed the badge on his helmet with feeling, raised his bat and helmet to the sky, looked long towards the heavens, and after two weeks of tension and grief he finally leapt into the air and was engulfed in a bear hug from Clarke. As Warner buried his head in his captain’s chest, his shoulders seemed to shake just a little. It was his 10th Test century, but the most meaningful and highly charged of them all. He eventually departed to yet another ovation when he tried to hit India’s leg-spinning debutant Karn Sharma into the Chappell stand and was caught at deep mid-wicket. Warner readily admitted to having a tear in his eye as he put on 118 with Clarke on the first day .","David Warner scored 145 from 163 balls as Australia dominated .

"West Ham midfielder Alex Song believes Stewart Downing will play a crucial role in his side's unlikely push for a European place after another starring role in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Sunderland. North-east native Downing lashed home the Hammers' 29th minute equaliser at the Stadium of Light seven minutes after Jordi Gomez put the Black Cats in front following a controversial penalty award. Victory kept the Hammers flying high in fourth place in the table and prompted boss Sam Allardyce to hail Downing as 'the best player on the pitch by far.' Stewart Downing is congratulated by West Ham team-mate Alex Song after scoring his side's equaliser . Downing scored his side's all-important equaliser against Sunderland in the 29th minute . Downing's excellent run of form saw him recalled to the England squad for the first time in four years last month and Song said on his club's official website: 'When he plays like this, good things can happen for him. 'I think Stewart is a very good player. He's been back in the national team, and we have to help him do his job very well. We've seen what's happened for him and it's a pleasure to play with him.' Allardyce was happy enough with a point although his side rode their luck after misfiring Sunderland striker Jozy Altidore produced an extraordinary miss in first-half injury time to keep the score level. And Hammers defender Winston Reid was also lucky to avoid giving away a second spot-kick midway through the second period when he clearly handled a cross from Santiago Vergini - though Allardyce predictably insisted the offence was 'not intentional'. Downing played against Scotland after being recalled to Roy Hodgson's Three Lions squad . Allardyce added: 'I am always happy with a point away from home in this division because it's not easy where ever you go. We showed character and it is the third time we've had to come from behind in the last three games.' Allardyce's insistence that Sunderland midfielder Adam Johnson had 'dived' to win his first half penalty did not improve the mood of Sunderland boss Gus Poyet who conceded his side is facing a tough winter after yet again turning a winnable game into a draw. Poyet cut a disconsolate figure in the post-match press conference as he admitted: 'I am here to win games and at the moment it is not possible and it takes a lot from the players to win one point. 'If something doesn't really change dramatically or individually as players in the next few weeks, it will be like that for the whole season and it is going to be different and not enjoyable. 'I don't think we can hide behind anything. I started talking about identity last year and I cannot talk about it any more - this is not the way I want my teams to play. We have to play better and adapt to the game more than we are.'","Stewart Downing scored West Ham's equaliser against Black Cats .

"Stewart Downing insists West Ham are loving upsetting the odds after they gatecrashed the top four. The Hammers are fourth in the Barclays Premier League ahead of Saturday's trip to Sunderland. Boss Sam Allardyce spent a reported £31million in the summer which was been dwarfed by the expenditure of Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool. Stewart Downing has played a key role in West Ham's impressive start to the season . The 30-year-old left Liverpool for the Hammers last summer and West Ham are now five places ahead of Reds . Summer buys Diafra Sahko, Cheikhou Kouyate and Aaron Cresswell have helped ease the pressure on Allardyce, who was one of the favourites to be sacked at the end of last season. West Ham were fourth bottom on 14 points this time last year but Downing is revelling in being one of this season's surprise packages. 'It's good, teams have spent a lot of money and people expected them to be in the top four because of what they've spent but it doesn't always work that way,' he said. 'We have bought very well, the players coming in have settled well. Sometimes you see players coming to the Premier League struggle to adapt. It's a big plus for us.' Sam Allardyce has transformed West Ham from relegation candidates to a side pushing for Europe . Andy Carroll scored twice as West Ham beat Swansea 3-1 at Upton Park last weekend . Southampton and the Hammers have shocked the top dogs during the first half of the season and Downing reckons breaking the 'big four' stranglehold on the Champions League spots is important. 'I think it would be good for the league,' he said. 'If you looked at the league at the minute you'd say it was false but we're there on merit, we've done well and we've played some big teams and played them off the park on the day. 'We've beaten Liverpool and Manchester City and ground out a win against Newcastle, which we would have lost last season. We have shown good qualities.' Diafra Sakho, who has netted seven times, has been a revelation since joining from Metz in the summer . The Hammers head to the Stadium of Light on Saturday with ex-Liverpool winger Downing insisting they can maintain their European challenge thanks to their extra quality. 'We have to look at each game as it comes. It's a big thing for us, Christmas, hopefully we can get lucky with injuries and suspensions,' said the 30-year-old. 'We had a difficult year last year, found it hard and were sucked in (to the relegation scrap) so this year we're playing with confidence. 'Selection gets hard and it's one the manager would like because he's never really had it. Everyone is fighting for their place and the step up in quality has been good this year.'","West Ham are fourth in the Premier League after one defeat in nine games .

"Hull manager Steve Bruce admits his scouts drew a blank when asked to find a chink in Chelsea's armour. The Barclays Premier League leaders may have surrendered their unbeaten record against Newcastle last week, but even that does not fill Bruce with optimism. The Blues are fierce hosts at Stamford Bridge and will be even more hungry than usual as they look to atone for dropping points last time out. The scale of the challenge is not lost on Bruce, who revealed his analysts had not been overly helpful in plotting a way past Jose Mourinho's men. Hull boss Steve Bruce admits he struggled to find a weakness in Chelsea's side . 'It's funny...one of the reports I get from the scouts usually tries to highlight a weakness and this one came back as 'none: they don't have any weakness', which I thought was quite amusing. 'They have marvellous talent. they haven't just got flair players, they're good at set-pieces, they're big and strong, they're powerful, good in attacking areas. 'They're one of the best teams in Europe and they've arguably got the best coach too. He's box office, the fella. What Jose has done is quite remarkable. 'I remember going there with Sunderland a few years ago (2010) and winning 3-0, which always sticks with me, but that doesn't happen very often.' Papiss Cisse scored twice as Newcastle ended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the Premier League . Cesc Fabregas, John Obi Mikel, and Gary Cahill look dejected . Defeat at St James' Park quashed growing expectation that Chelsea would match Arsenal's 'Invincibles' this season, but Bruce would not have been surprised to see them repeat that feat. 'They had the look of being unbeatable didn't they?' he added. 'Jose's come back in and does what he does very well. 'You have to go and work against Chelsea because they do. They're a terrific team who everyone thought would be unbeatable. It just shows you what this league is that their eight- or nine-point lead has been taken down to three. 'So if we go with the same mentality as we did to Liverpool and Arsenal, who knows, maybe we can take something from them.' Bruce knows this is a big time of year for Hull after they slipped into the bottom three . Despite relishing the challenge of taking on the title favourites, Bruce's priorities over the festive period are likely to lie elsewhere. Swansea, Sunderland and Leicester represent the next three games and it is results against those sides that provide the best route out of the bottom three. 'Now is a big month coming up, we have big games coming up and let's hope we can go and win a couple of them and put us back in mid-table where we all want to be,' he said. 'We're probably four or five points short of where we want to be and we've got a cluster of games coming up over Christmas. If we can put back to back wins together you could find yourself up in the top half of the division.'","Chelsea surrendered their unbeaten start to the Premier League at Newcastle .

"Kellie Maloney has announced she is planning to return to boxing by taking on fighters with a new management company. Maloney is undergoing gender reassignment, and once that is complete she hopes to resume a career that saw Lennox Lewis shepherded to world heavyweight titles in the 1990s. Maloney, under her previous name Frank, called time on a 30-year career in October 2013, handing back licences to the British Boxing Board of Control after growing disillusioned with the sport. Kellie Maloney has revealed her ambition to return as a boxing promoter in 2015 after gender reassignment . Along with Lewis, Maloney also took the likes of Paul Ingle and Scott Harrison to world titles. She told the Daily Telegraph: 'I haven't really done anything for 18 months other than concentrate on my gender reassignment. I'm actually missing being out there in the real world. I've got a lot of talks lined up to do - talking and diversity meetings, which I enjoy. 'But my biggest love is sports. I'm forming a sports management company, which we'll be announcing in the new year, and part of me wants to go back into boxing. 'I've consulted a couple of promoters, one British based and one European based. Part of me wants to go back and start again as Kellie Maloney because I've always been the underdog in boxing. I've always been fighting the establishment. That's part of my make-up. 'If I was to succeed this time, it would be bigger than taking Lennox Lewis to the heavyweight title. I'm meeting my family in the new year and we'll sit down and talk about it. Some of my family like the idea and some don't like the stress and pressure it brings. As it stands, I'm leaning towards going back into boxing unless something drastic happens in the new year.' The 61-year-old added: 'I want to know how the fans would take to it as well. That's also important to me. I don't want to be insulted. I want to walk into the arena and be given the respect and credit I deserve.'

"Everton and England defender Phil Jagielka talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who would play him in a movie about his life. WHO IS YOUR SPORTING HERO? My brother, Stephen. You always want to do what your big brother does. He started out with Manchester City and had spells at Shrewsbury and Accrington. Stephen  encouraged me to chase my dream and became my idol. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN IF YOU WERE NOT A SPORTSMAN? I think I’d have always been in sports. If I hadn’t been a footballer, I’d have wanted to be a golfer. In reality, I’d probably be a PE teacher. I couldn’t work in an office. That would send me stir crazy. Everton centre-back Phil Jagielka says he would have been a PE teacher if he hadn't become a footballer . The England defender picks out brother Stephen as his role model when he was younger . WHAT WAS THE BEST MOMENT OF YOUR CAREER? I’ve got a few; my Everton debut, my first cap and goal for England, but I have to choose my debut for Sheffield United against Swindon (May 2000). I came on as a substitute in a 2-2 draw and knew then I had a chance of making it. AND THE WORST... Rupturing my cruciate ligament against Manchester City in April 2009 and I missed the FA Cup final against Chelsea because of it. Sitting in a suit at Wembley in sweltering heat with my knee in a brace was torture. Rupturing his knee ligaments and missing the 2009 FA Cup final is Jagielka's worst career moment . IF YOUR HOUSE WAS BURNING DOWN, WHAT WOULD BE THE ONE POSSESSION YOU WOULD SAVE? As long as my wife, Emily, and kids, Mia and Zach, were safe, all I’d be bothered about is my dog, Leo. He’s a fearsome shih tzu, disguised as a little ball of fluff. THREE FAVOURITE SONGS ON YOUR IPOD? I’m not a big music fan. I’ll have Radio 1 on when I’m on the way into work but I tend to use my time in the car to give my Dad or my mates a safe, hands-free call. WHAT WAS THE BEST BOOK YOU'VE READ? I’m not a big reader, either, but I’ve just completed my team-mate Leon Osman’s autobiography. It was especially good. Leon Osman's (right) autobiography was the last book that Jagielka can remember reading . WHAT'S YOUR BEST KARAOKE SONG? I wanted to do Eye of The Tiger as my initiation song when I joined Everton but got stitched up. I told Phil Neville about it but he told Ossie, who got up and sang it before me. I ended up doing an impromptu version of Blue Suede Shoes. I think I pulled it off. Just. CAN YOU COOK? Yep, I’m not bad. Lasagne, spaghetti bolognese. If I can chuck it in a pan and stir it around, I’m fine. You won’t catch me going for any fancy ingredients or adding garlic to everything, mind. IN A FILM OF YOUR LIFE, WHO WOULD PLAY YOU? If we are going Hollywood — and why not? — I’d say someone like Will Ferrell, Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler. Jagielka can imagine himself being played by Anchorman star Will Ferrell in a movie of his life . TELL US A SECRET... I still get called ‘Son of Neil’. It’s well known I had a great relationship with Neil Warnock but he used to come into training and ask in front of the lads whether his wife, Sharon, had cooked my scrambled eggs properly that morning. I went along with it for the banter but that’s where the nickname came from. I can categorically say, however, Mrs Warnock never made my breakfast!

"CLICK HERE to read Dominic King's full match report from Anfield . Brendan Rodgers is under serious pressure for the first time in his reign as Liverpool manager. There is no suggestion that the worst Champions League campaign in the club’s history will cost Rodgers his job, as he retains Fenway Sports Group’s full support. But, after Tuesday’s insipid 1-1 draw with Basle, Rodgers accepted that the scrutiny on him is building with each bad result. Somehow he must reverse the negative spiral Liverpool are in, particularly as the next three games — clashes with Manchester United and Arsenal in the Barclays Premier League sandwich a Capital One Cup quarter-final at Bournemouth — are pivotal. Sportsmail examines the key issues. Brendan Rodgers speaks to his players as Liverpool crash out of the Champions League at the group stage . The Liverpool boss accepts that recent results have left him under increasing pressure at Anfield . Steven Gerrard looks dejected after the Basle defeat... in what could be his last Champions League game . WHAT IS HIS BEST TEAM? After spending in excess of £100million last summer, you would think there would be some stability to the sides Rodgers is sending out. The reality, however, is different. Liverpool have played 23 games in all competitions this season and Rodgers has named 23 different selections. Not since Liverpool were beaten 2-0 by Chelsea on April 27 — the game that ultimately cost them the Barclays Premier League title — has Rodgers named the same team, and the leaky defence has been subject to constant change. Martin Skrtel stares at the ground as Basle players celebrate qualifying for the knockout stages . Too many of Rodgers' signings, including Dejan Lovren (centre) and Lazar Markovic (right) haven't performed . CLICK HERE to read Sportsmail's analysis on what progress Rodgers has made at Anfield . The concern at the moment is that no matter what personnel or system Rodgers deploys, performances are not improving. Is there an argument for him to put his faith in a certain 11 and formation and persist until results change? ‘If you need to win, why not put them under pressure from the word go?’ said former Liverpool boss Roy Evans. ‘We waited until we were down to 10 men with 20 minutes to go, then threw everything at them. Why not do it from the start? The way we approached the game was a bit negative.’ CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE . When results are good, harmony reigns. Once they begin to tail off, though, the ambience dips and the manner in which Liverpool’s fortunes have plummeted this season has had an impact on the morale of the squad. Captain Gerrard celebrates after scoring a late free-kick, but it was too little, too late for Liverpool . Rodgers cuts a lonely figure as he walks off the pitch - knowing the situation has to improve . So assured when they were on top of their game last year, the team’s faltering confidence has now eroded performance levels. That was never more apparent than after 42 seconds against Basle when Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren passed the ball as if it was a hot potato. The dressing room was, once again, very subdued after their exit from the Champions League and Rodgers will be aware of how crucial it is to Liverpool’s fortunes not to let the atmosphere fester. He sets the tone at Melwood and he must remain on the front foot. ADD SOME AGGRESSION . The mood around Anfield changed for the better in the 62nd minute against Basle when Steven Gerrard thundered into a challenge and emerged with the ball. Liverpool supporters like good footballers but they also like players with a mean streak. Liverpool, aside from their captain Gerrard, appear to be a team lacking in aggression . Raheem Sterling (centre) walks off the pitch as Liverpool contemplate Thursday nights in the Europa League . Are Liverpool too soft? It could be that they are too nice. When they played Real Madrid at Anfield, they barely laid a glove on the champions and never threatened to make things uncomfortable. That criticism has been recurring. The result means Liverpool finished third in Group B behind Real Madrid and Basle . One player who has been missed and would give Liverpool an ‘edge’ is injured defender Jon Flanagan. They could do with someone else to give them steel. Liverpool don’t have huge sums to spend in January but, perhaps, whatever cash there is should go on an enforcer. RIDE OUT THE STORM . Rodgers has made a point of saying that some defeats ‘can be the making’ of you but there is no doubt the criticism of his team, results and himself will be stinging him. Take this from Steve Nicol, whose medals in a 13-year Anfield career include a European Cup. ‘If things don’t change then ultimately Brendan will pay the price,’ said Nicol. ‘If this team keeps performing the way they are, I don’t think they’ll have another option. We are not even halfway through and most people don’t expect Liverpool to get into the top four. Basle's Fabian Frei (centre) wheels away after opening the scoring on an insipid night at Anfield . A Liverpool supporter makes his feelings clear as the Anfield club are knocked out of the Champions League . ‘You wonder where this team are going. He has tried to add to the squad to make it better. Somehow it has turned the other way. The team are completely rudderless. They don’t look to have any imagination going forward and defensively they look at odds. This is a desperate time for Liverpool.’ The reaction on social media and radio phone-ins saw some supporters ask for him to be removed, less than seven months after being named LMA Manager of the Year, but there is no chance owners FSG will dispense with him soon after giving him a new contract. What they do expect, is to be back in the top four come May. If Rodgers is to achieve that, he needs to get results.

Neymar has been on fine form this season and has scored 11 goals in La Liga and three in the Champions League. Barca missed his pace and trickery in attack at Getafe, when they turned in a toothless performance that meant Real were able to stretch their advantage to four points.

None of the caviar sold by Aldi from December 21 are from the Huso huso sturgeon, the Independent on Sunday reported. It will instead use caviar produced by river and Amur sturgeon in China, which have no relation to the Huso huso species. Kenneth Benning, from London Fine Foods and the UK's only caviar farm, Exmoor Caviar, said Aldi's addition of the word 'Beluga' would confuse shoppers. He said: 'As a trader in caviar, there is not a farm on the planet that can sell Beluga caviar for Aldi's claimed price. Aldi instead used Amur sturgeon and river sturgeon (file picture) for its caviar, which could explain why it costs four-times less than Beluga caviar from Fortnum & Mason . A caviar expert has claimed that Aldi's use of the word 'Beluga' will confuse shoppers when the product goes on sale on December 21 . 'Given how long it takes to mature the species, many farms have now started to mix sturgeons to try and create a 'Beluga-ish' product they can try to sell as ‘Beluga’, whereby the male Huso huso is crossed with another faster-growing species such as sterlet or baeri. 'This is known as a hybrid cross. However a hybrid cross such as ‘Huso Sterlet’ is not such a headline grabbing name as the well-known ‘Beluga’ caviar. 'The adding of the word ‘Beluga’ in Aldi’s product implies something that is actually not its origin or value. Hence this caviar has no correlation whatsoever to ‘Beluga’ caviar or the Huso huso sturgeon. Aldi should rectify this.' Aldi, which has gradually made gains on the UK's four big supermarkets by tempting shoppers with cheap deals, admitted the Christmas caviar is not from the Huso huso sturgeon. A spokesman for the supermarket said: We can offer shoppers Amur Beluga caviar at an exceptional price by making savings across the business, which we pass onto our customers rather than boost our margins. 'This Christmas customers will be able to enjoy Amur Beluga caviar which comes from Amur Beluga sturgeon, a hybrid of the Amur sturgeon and the river Beluga sturgeon. 'All of our information on the packaging explains to customers the origin of the caviar and we are confident that people will enjoy this special treat on Christmas Day.'","Aldi's caviar is not made from Beluga roe, the supermarket admits .

"Dos Equis' 'The Most Interesting Man in the World' was once a 'surprise guest' at a birthday party for President Barack Obama, the actor featured in the popular commercials revealed on Thursday. Asked during on a reddit forum who the most interesting man in the world is that he's met, actor Jonathan Goldsmith tossed out the president's name and recounted the time he spent a day and a half with the Commander in Chief at Camp David several years ago. 'He had brought out 10 of his dear friends going all the way back to Grade School, I felt very honored and privileged to be there,' Goldsmith said. Scroll down for video . Actor Jonathan Goldsmith, best known as Dos Equis' 'Most Interesting Man in the World,' said Thursday that the most interesting man he's met is the President Barack Obama, whose birthday party he once attended as a 'surprise guest' 'I will report that the President is a very good marksman, contrary to frequently held opinions,' Goldsmith said, defending Obama, whose shooting ability became the butt of jokes last year after the White House released this picture of him last year . 'We talked. And he was sharing a lot of stories with his dear friends, going back to some of the early years of school, to as far back as grad school. and I was very glad to be there, it was a lot of fun,'he noted. Goldsmith did not say when his rendezvous with the president and his pals took place, but it may have occurred during the first year Obama was in office. That summer the first lady held a surprise party for her husband at the presidential retreat in Frederick County, Maryland, to celebrate his forty-eighth birthday. The exclusive party was reportedly attended by longtime friends of the president from Chicago and Hawaii. Obama has spent three other birthday weekends at Camp David, including one following his most recent birthday last month. The president used the government operated getaway spot as his birthday party venue in 2012 and 2013, as well. Goldsmith told redditors on Thursday that the year he attended the president's birthday bash, guests competed in archery, went bowling and shot skeet. 'I will report that the President is a very good marksman, contrary to frequently held opinions,' Goldsmith said, defending Obama, whose shooting ability became the butt of jokes last year after he claimed he shot skeet 'all the time' at Camp David. The White House then released a photo of Obama shooting a shot gun while wearing protective glasses and ear muffs to prove that the president, who has aggressively worked to place sharper restrictions on gun sales, does in fact know how to shoot a firearm. Goldsmith said Obama and his friends also played basketball during the special visit, though the actor said he personally sat those festivities out. 'My basketball playing days are a little behind me and I didn't want to embarrass myself with these kids,' he admitted. Goldsmith was so taken with Obama that in the fall of 2012 he hosted a fundraiser for the president's reelection campaign. The move angered some Dos Equis drinkers, Advertising Age noted at the time, who consider Goldsmith and the character he plays in the TV commercials to be one in the same.","Jonathan Goldsmith, AKA 'The Most Interesting Man in the World' said Thursday that Obama is the most interesting person he'd met .

"Harry Redknapp's message was clear. ‘If we sold Charlie Austin we might as well go home’ was his assessment after the striker fired QPR to another win with the sort of hat-trick which will have England manager Roy Hodgson taking notice. Redknapp, the QPR boss, is aware bigger clubs will come knocking when the January transfer window opens. With 18 months left on Austin’s contract, Rangers owner Tony Fernandes knows they must tie him down — and sharpish. That need is even more pressing after he dragged his side to what had looked an impossible win after Albion took a two-goal lead through Joleon Lescott and Silvestre Varela. Following his hat-trick against West Brom Charlie Austin is the top English goal scorer in the Premier League . QPR's in-form striker Austin scores a penalty for the hosts to halve their deficit against the Baggies . Austin headed in his side's winner three minutes from the end of normal time to seal the win and his hat-trick . Sportsmail was delighted to see Craig Pawson give a penalty for James Morrison tugging Leroy Fer’s shirt in the box. We have been campaigning for several weeks to rid the game of this cheating. Austin is the top English goalscorer in the Premier League — only Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero have more than his 11 — and he has earned QPR a stunning 13 points. Without him, they would be heading back to the Championship. ‘His target would be around 20 goals now,’ said Redknapp. ‘The way he’s going, it’s not impossible.’ This is the same Austin, don’t forget, who was scoring goals for Poole Town in the Wessex League five years ago. ‘He’s a goalscorer. He’s got a great attitude,’ added Redknapp. ‘There is no side to him. He ain’t lairy — he’s a lovely boy who’s been to work for a living.’ Austin’s story is one to inspire young footballers scratching around in non-league. It can be done through hard graft, if you have the talent. For this 25-year-old, the rise might have happened sooner. Grandfather Alistair is an old friend of Redknapp and urged the manager to sign him when at Tottenham. Manager Harry Redknapp said that his free-scoring striker will now be looking to reach 20 goals this season . QPR striker Austin poses with the match ball after his hat-trick against West Brom at Loftus Road . Redknapp admitted he scoffed when ‘Ozzy’ said his grandson, a striker with Hungerford Town, would do a job in the top flight, but who’s laughing now? An England call could well be on the way. ‘It’s a knack — he’s in the right place at the right time,’ added Redknapp. ‘If you score 20 goals in the Championship this year you’ll score in the Premier League.’ They’ve known each other for two decades but Redknapp scoffed when ‘Ozzy’ said his grandson would do a job in the top flight when finding the net at Hungerford Town. Who’s laughing now? An England call could very well be on its way. ‘Goalscorers find a yard of space. It’s a knack - he’s in the right place at the right time,’ Redknapp added. ‘If you score 20 goals in the Championship this year you’ll score in the Premier League. It’s not rocket science, it’s that knack that people have got - they’ve been scoring goals since they were kids.’ Ask Austin what his dreams were as a boy and this can’t be far off.","Harry Redknapp revealed his desire to keep in-form striker Charlie Austin .

"A chef who murdered a mother-of-four he met on a dating website only days earlier has been jailed for a minimum of 17 years. Kevin Hawke, 33, was told at Liverpool Crown Court today that he must serve a minimum of 17 years and six months after he admitted murdering Sharon Winters in July. A court heard how the mother-of-four suffered 90 injuries in the brutal attack in Walton, Liverpool, most of them stab wounds. Kevin Hawke (left) murdered mother-of-four Sharon Winters (right) in Walton, Liverpool,  in a brutal attack . Ms Winters was discovered within her County Road flat, next to Everton's Goodison Park, after police were called to the incident on July 13. Hawke, of no fixed abode, but originally from Burnley, was arrested outside the property and was said to be 'very, very drunk'. Bouquets of flowers lined the pavement outside Ms Winters' home in the wake of her murder, accompanied by emotional tributes from friends and family. Ms Winters was remembered by her brother Stephen as a 'lovely person who would do anything for anyone'. He said at the time of her death: 'She will be missed so much by all of her family. 'She didn't deserve to suffer and die in this manner. 'She was a much loved sister and mother of four who will be sadly missed.' Hawke has been due to stand trial at Liverpool Crown Court today but changed his plea at the last minute. He will only be considered for parole once he has served the minimum term. Hawke, 33, was told at Liverpool Crown Court today that he must serve a minimum of 17 years and six months . Detective Inspector Phil Mahon, from Liverpool North CID, said: 'Kevin Hawkes has today been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his new girlfriend, Sharon Winters, and will have to serve a minimum of 17 and a half years before he can be considered for release. 'He brutally attacked Sharon in her home in County Road only days after meeting her on a dating website, leaving her with terrible injuries which tragically proved fatal. 'His actions not only deprived Sharon of the life ahead of her when she was only 39-years-old, but also took her away from her beloved family who have been left devastated by Hawke's crimes. 'Merseyside Police takes incidents of a domestic nature extremely seriously and I hope that the prison sentence Hawke's is now facing sends a strong message out to other violent offenders that we will do everything possible to bring you to justice.'","Kevin Hawke, 33, murdered mother-of-four Sharon Winters in July .

"It was a day of firsts at St James’ Park – a new giant screen which became detached and delayed kick-off by an hour, a maiden Premier League victory for under-fire Alan Pardew and the surprise appearance of owner Mike Ashley in the home dressing-room. Ashley has not seen the team win since May and made straight for the changing quarters on full-time where he congratulated the manager by whom he has stuck during their recent struggle. Faith is also what Pardew has had to show in match-winner Gabriel Obertan. For if the 60-minute wait for the match to get started seemed like an age, it was nothing compared to the 32 months since Obertan last scored a top-flight goal. Gabriel Obertan scored the winner for Newcastle as they beat Leicester 1-0 at St James' Park . Newcastle: Krul 6.5, Janmaat 6.5, Steven Taylor 7, Coloccini 6, Dummett 6 (Haidara 72 6), Anita 5 (Perez 59 6), Colback 6.5, Obertan 7.5, Sissoko 5.5, Gouffran (Cabella 90), Cisse 6. Subs Not Used: Ferreyra, Elliot, Abeid, Armstrong. Goals: Obertan 71. Leicester: Schmeichel 6.5, De Laet 5.5, Morgan 6.5, Moore 6.5, Konchesky 5, Cambiasso 5.5 (Knockaert 79 6), James 6, Drinkwater 6.5, Schlupp 5.5 (Nugent 56 6), Ulloa 5.5. Subs Not Used: Hammond, King, Hamer, Wasilewski. Booked: Moore, De Laet, Ulloa. Att: 51,886 . Ref: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire). It was, however, very nearly the match that wasn’t. There was serious doubt about the fixture going ahead when canvas surrounding the 60-metre monitor – making its debut - became dislodged by high winds at around 1pm. It took two hours to resolve the issue and, with thousands of supporters held at the turnstiles amid safety concerns, kick-off was delayed to 4pm. But that wasn’t before midfielder Cheick Tiote hobbled from the warm-up and declared himself unfit to play – at this point, Pardew could have been forgiven for wishing another gust to come along and postpone the contest. Come the end, though, the Newcastle boss was puffing his cheeks in relief, the win meaning he had avoided the ignominy of a club record eight without victory from the start of a Premier League season. The identity of his saviour was even more satisfying. Obertan – a player signed on the say-so of Pardew – had become a figure of fun on Tyneside after three ineffective seasons. But it was the 25-year-old who had the last laugh yesterday as his 71st-minute strike – his first since February, 2012 – gave his manager a much-needed three points. And Pardew said: ‘I was so pleased Gabby got the goal and it capped a great display. ‘He’s a player who needs to build his own self-confidence. He’s been terrific for us this season. I had a feeling he could still be a great player. He’s still young but he needs to deliver. ‘He’s a player where the environment needs to be centred on him. When we finished fifth he played a big part and I never forgot that. Being young, sometimes you have to wait. ‘But right now he warrants his place in the team.’ The French midfielder cut inside from the left wing and fired a right-foot shot into the bottom corner with 20 minutes to play . Obertan's goal earned Newcastle their first victory of the Premier League campaign but kept them in the bottom three . Obertan celebrates his winner at St James' Park after scoring the only goal of the game in the 71st minute . The locals, with an extra hour of ale inside them, could have been restless following the pre-match farce and an opening hour in which their side had at times toiled. But their patience and support was rewarded when Obertan, gliding infield from the left, fired beyond Kasper Schmeichel from 20 yards, albeit with the aid of a slight deflection. Pardew, whose team remain in the bottom three, went on: ‘It’s been difficult, we’ve been playing under huge pressure. You can’t get away from that in this city. ‘We really can self-harm sometimes with the pressure we put ourselves under. But when we win we have euphoria and I thought the stadium was terrific – I can’t thank the fans enough.’ Under pressure Newcastle manager Alan Pardew (right) celebrates Obertan's winner at St James' Park .

Of the delay, he added: ‘The TV looked a bit vulnerable when I walked in, and I thought “how’s that appeared?”. ‘But Nigel (Pearson) was very calm about it all and I thank him for not making a big deal about it. In the end it didn’t affect us.’ Newcastle should have been ahead early on when Obertan charged fully 50 yards before feeding Papiss Cisse who drew back for the unmarked Fabricio Coloccini - the defender somehow populating Leicester’s penalty area – but he stabbed wide. City finished the half much the stronger and, when Tim Krul lost flight of Marc Albrighton’s cross-cum-shot, the ball cracked the upright, the goalkeeper’s blushes ultimately spared. Paul Konchesky gifted a chance to Cisse after the break when the forward seized upon his back-pass, rounding Schmeichel only to fire into the side-netting. Obertan, though, made no mistake when he climaxed a swift breakaway to win the match. And visiting boss Pearson reflected: ‘We had promising situations but at times our quality let us down. ‘We’ve been done on the counter-attack from what was a promising situation for ourselves.’ Pardew, meanwhile, admitted that he was, for once, looking forward to Match of the Day. ‘I tend to watch even when it’s nasty and horrible, it’s important to keep up to date with what’s being said about your team,’ he said. ‘But I will watch it with a smile tonight.’ That winning feeling was certainly worth the wait, for Pardew, Ashley and Obertan.

"Sean Dyche has identified previous Barclays Premier League experience as the key attribute he desires in any potential Burnley buys this January. The Clarets manager is ready to add to his squad in the new year as they bid to prove the naysayers wrong and avoid an immediate demotion back to the second tier. It has been a case of so far, so good for last year's Sky Bet Championship runners-up, who lifted themselves out of the division's bottom three with victory over Southampton last weekend. Ashley Barnes bundled the ball home from close range to give Burnley a valuable win against Southampton . But ahead of a daunting nine-day period, which includes fixtures against Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City before the new year arrives, Dyche is mindful that his inexperienced group may need some know-how down the stretch. England Under-21 internationals Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane, neither of whom had played in the Premier League before this season, were Dyche's most recent recruits and he admits there will be a shift in his approach to next month's window. 'Our market last year was particularly different, it's slightly different now,' said the ex-Watford boss. 'It's not that we're not looking at younger players - that's quite obvious with Nathaniel here and Keano - we still take value in young players. But it is also fair to say we are looking for players who've had a feel of the Premier League. Sean Dyche makes his way onto the pitch ahead of Burnley's match with Southampton on Saturday . 'We are not necessarily a young group, but we're quite an inexperienced group as regards regular Premier League football.' There was no summer splurge at Turf Moor, although Dyche did acquire some players who had vast experience at this level. However, with Matt Taylor and Stephen Ward both out injured due to ankle problems, and 33-year-old Steven Reid very much on the periphery of the first-team picture, those players have not had a great impact. Michael Duff, 36, is also sidelined so the starting line-up which Dyche will likely deploy at Spurs on Saturday will include just two players - Dean Marney and David Jones - who made more than 10 top-flight starts before this campaign. 'We've got a group who've maybe had a season in it, but it would be nice to have a few more who've been around it a long time,' Dyche said. Barnes celebrates with his team-mates after scoring the all-important goal to give his side a valuable win . 'Matty's been in it for years but he's injured, Reidy's at the other end of his career and he knows what part he plays for us now. So there's a balance to how we're monitoring players now.' While Dyche trains his thoughts on possible incomings, he knows that the speculation regarding Clarets striker Danny Ings' future is unlikely to go away any time soon. The 22-year-old is out of contract in the summer and this week both Newcastle and Sunderland were mooted as potential destinations. Yet his manager remains unmoved by the transfer talk having heard it all before. 'We don't need to ignore it, we're just used to it,' Dyche said. 'He's used to it, I'm used to it. It's not a new story - people were talking about Ingsy last year from the beginning of the season so we're used to it.'","Burnley finished runners-up in the Championship last season .

"It wasn't meant to be like this. After a record-breaking Premier League points haul last season, Everton were supposed to pick up where they left off and mount a serious challenge for the top four. However, things have not gone to plan at Goodison Park. Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Southampton left the Toffees closer to the relegation zone  than those coveted Champions League places. Everton were expected to mount a serious challenge for the top four this season but have struggled for form . The Toffees lost away at Southampton on Saturday and are closer to the relegation zone than the top four . After a record-breaking Premier League points haul last season, Evertonians weren't expecting to struggle . Everton manager Roberto Martinez has changed the entire outlook of the football club with his positive attitude . Going into Christmas last season, the Blues had lost just one game and were two points off top spot. This season, Everton have already lost six matches and have won just five times in the Premier League. It's hard to pin-point exactly what has caused Everton's form to drop so considerably over one summer. Second-season syndrome for the manager? The Blues' Europa League campaign? Not enough new additions during the last transfer window? Whatever the reason, put simply, Everton haven't reached the high standards the club set themselves during Roberto Martinez's first year on Merseyside. Everton played some scintilating football last season but have struggled to live up to the high standards set . 2014-15 (after 17 games) League position: 10th . Points from top spot: 18 . Wins: 5 . Draws: 6 . Defeats: 6 . Goals for: 27 . Goals conceded: 27 . Goal difference: 0 . 2013-14 (after 17 games) League position: 5th . Points from top spot: 2 . Wins: 9 . Draws: 7 . Defeats: 1 . Goals for: 29 . Goals conceded: 16 . Goal difference: +13 . One problem - a season-long one - has been Everton's defence. Conceding 10 goals in their first three fixtures was an unexpected setback and the season has failed to lift off since. The occasional clean sheet has been kept but the performances of an ageing backline have been called into question. The Blues' back five - so miserly in past seasons - has looked a shadow of itself and not at all confident while Tim Howard has failed to repeat his World Cup heroics. Costly individuals errors - out of Martinez's control - were the main contributing factor for Everton's poor start but the club are yet to recover and languish in mid-table. Everton lost 6-3 to Chelsea at the end of August - conceding ten goals in their opening three league fixtures . Everton keeper Tim Howard looks on as Romelu Lukaku heads into his own net to give Southampton the lead . Everton's ageing backline have struggled for much of the season and appear to be short of confidence . Goalkeeper Howard has failed to produce the form he showed for the USA during the World Cup in Brazil . Meanwhile, at the other end of the pitch, the goals have flowed as freely as before but unlike last year, loan star Romelu Lukaku now has a £28million price tag to live up to. Paramount to the club moving forward, it was essential Everton made the Belgian's move from Chelsea a permanent one but the striker has much to prove. The potential to net 20 goals a season is what Lukaku brings to Martinez's side but the 21-year-old must do more to warrant the massive fee Everton paid for his services. For such a giant of a forward, Lukaku has lacked any real aerial threat, struggled to hold the ball up and, while he still finds the back of the net, his general play has been lethargic. Romelu Lukaku scores plenty of goals but must do more to warrant the huge fee Everton paid for his services . Lukaku adhered himself to the Everton faithful last season and struck up a special relationship with Martinez . Lukaku's general play has been lethargic this season and, for such a giant, has lacked any real aerial threat . The blue half of Merseyside attacked with vigour and purpose last season but the scintillating football which delighted the Everton faithful has been missing this term. Martinez has failed to find a real balance among his front four this term and must find a formation which suits the vast array of attacking talent at his disposal. Too often this season, Martinez has stuck with Lukaku, Samuel Eto'o, Steven Naismith and Ross Barkley as his front four, but all prefer to play centrally. Lacking any natural width, it appears Martinez is selecting his best individuals rather than his best XI. Square pegs in round holes. Steven Naismith (left) and Ross Barkley (right) have both been forced to play out wide on occasion this term . Everton forward Samuel Eto'o speaks to  Muhamed Besic during Everton's sixth defeat of the season . Having arrived at Everton from Wigan in the summer of 2013 to replace David Moyes, Martinez's positive attitude changed the entire outlook of the football club during his first 12 months. However, this constantly cheery outlook - even after the worst performances - is proving a gripe for some supporters. Rather than praising the players' energy, work-rate and commitment to the cause, the club's support would much rather the Spaniard sometimes admitted: 'We weren't good enough.' It must be said, Martinez did concede following the defeat at St Mary's: 'We are to blame for the defeat. We were a little bit soft, done too easily with balls into the box. It’s disappointing the way we defended our box,' and will have at least satisfied supporters with his honesty. Everton boss  Martinez admitted his team were too soft and defended poorly during the defeat to Southampton . Struggling on home soil, the Europa League has provided some solace - Everton playing some blistering attacking football to overcome Wolfsburg, flying-high in the Bundesliga, Lille and Krasnodar to reach the last 32 of the competition - and proves the Toffees still have it; somewhere. However, Everton fans are desperate to see the club perform to it's maximum potential both at home and abroad. Luckily, the games come thick and fast during this busy Christmas schedule and provide Everton with a great opportunity to kick start their stuttering season going into 2015. After last year's achievements, Martinez must show his true credentials as manager by arresting the slide. Everton must act and take advantage of the festive period to save their Premier League season. Phil Jagielka is mobbed after scoring a late equaliser against Liverpool - one of few highlights this season .

"Sean Dyche's transfer dealings may extend into Europe for the first time this January, although the Burnley boss was bemused by suggestions he is about to bring an Ecuadorian to east Lancashire. The Clarets' squad is the only one in the Barclays Premier League made up entirely of British and Irish players, with Dyche previously acknowledging the club did not have the scouting network in place to cast their net on to the continent. That changed last month when former Everton and Manchester United scout Robbie Cooke was hired to take up the role of UK and international scout as one of last season's promoted clubs bid to adapt to life in the top flight. Burnley boss Sean Dyche is considering the possibility of dipping into the European transfer market . Burnley's squad is made up of British players - including Kieran Trippier and Dean Marney (pictured) Dyche brought in eight British and Irish players during the summer transfer window . 'It's well documented we were behind the curve with regards the recruitment system,' said Dyche. 'We had one but we weren't going into Europe. Now we are venturing over there. 'That doesn't mean we are going to sign anyone but we are beginning to get the background and trying to get depth of knowledge that's needed in recruitment. 'But there's no guarantees; they don't just grow on trees out there. 'There's this misconception that you go into Europe and there's thousands of players who are all brilliant for the Premier League. It's not so. 'We still have to define the ones that are right, we still have to align them with the team and what fits the team moving forward.' While branching out into those avenues could see a host of new players linked with a move to Turf Moor, Dyche scoffed at the one potential new recruit who was suggested as a possible target. Junior Sornoza has been linked with a move to Turf Moor but Dyche revealed he did not know the player . Junior Sornoza, a 20-year-old attacking midfielder plying his trade in South America, was mooted as a player Burnley were keen on this week, which came as a surprise to Dyche. 'Who is that? That's news to me,' he added. 'It would be highly unlikely that (our scouting) goes that far afield. We're starting off building a base in England, going into Europe as the first marker and if and when there's time to go beyond that, we'll see. But certainly not at the moment, no.' Dyche baulked at the fees commanded by British-based players over the summer and there could be a chance that he taps into a market which may offer cheaper alternatives when the transfer window reopens. That could prevent him from finding the same frustrations as he found last summer, with the Clarets manager knowing January bargains will be hard to find closer to home. 'The British market has been a lot more unpredictable and a lot higher than it has been historically,' Dyche said. 'It's always been thought of as higher than going into Europe, which is why there are so many players from further afield coming into the English game, particularly at the Premier League level. We've found that it has been very, very tough. 'I can't see it going backwards. With the new TV deal, everyone tells me that's going to go up. There's every chance the fees, contracts, wages, will go up in turn. It's a tough challenge for us as a club.'","Burnley's squad is made up entirely of British and Irish players .

"Burnley striker Sam Vokes is inching ever closer to a first-team Christmas comeback, boss Sean Dyche has said. The 25-year-old Wales international was pivotal in last season's promotion, scoring 21 goals, but has been sidelined since March after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee against Leicester. Clarets manager Dyche has so far been unable to pair Vokes with Danny Ings, a partnership which yielded 47 goals for him last year, but that day could come around the festive period. Burnley striker Sam Vokes has been out since March after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament . Vokes has played two full development squad games in recent weeks and, with another pencilled in on Monday against Blackpool, his return appears imminent. 'Vokesy is on his way back,' said Dyche, whose men face Tottenham this weekend. 'He got another 90 minutes in the other day so he's right at the end of his transition back into the main first-team squad. We're really pleased with that and he's pleased with that. 'In the grand scheme of things he's not had four full games. If you'd finished one season and gone into the next you roughly have a three-month window and during that transition back into playing again you probably have a 45, 75 and minimum of three 90 minutes. That's with normal shut-down. 'He's had eight and a half months out and we've got to be mindful of that when you're talking about true fitness and true ability to play in the first team. But Burnley manager Sean Dyche believes Vokes can return for his side during the Christmas fixtures . 'He's going well, he's feeling good and we're really happy with that at this stage. He's getting closer.' After a lengthy nine-month absence, Dyche completely understands that Vokes is itching to be involved in first-team affairs again as soon as possible. 'It's a long haul,' said the ex-Watford manager. 'I had a few long-term injuries and it's difficult. You want to be involved all of the time and you know you can't be. 'There's a lot of individual work, a lot of loneliness. Luckily here, because of the environment we've got, you're almost stumbling across people. 'He's never felt like he's not involved in it because there's always some of the players around, the staff around. 'But true involvement is playing and I'm pleased for him that he's back - at least playing - and now it's moving on to the first team.' However, there is certainly no guarantee Vokes picks up where he left off alongside England Under-21 international Ings in Burnley's attack. Vokes (centre) formed a formidable partnership with Danny Ings (right) as Burnley won promotion last season . Ashley Barnes' goal against Southampton last time out moved the east Lancashire club out of the bottom three and was also the second time this season he has grabbed an important winner. Dyche, though, welcomes having such selection headaches. 'That's a dilemma any manager wants,' he conceded. 'A lot was made about the financial side but we wanted a group that was demanding of each other with real true competition. I feel we've definitely got that. 'Where it can take us, we'll see. But we like the demand that's in the group and Vokesy will only add to that.'","Sam Vokes has been out since March with a serious knee injury .

"The full-time whistle was still echoing inside a rapidly emptying Ibrox when a Christmas classic boomed from the PA system. According to denim-clad 80s favourite Shakin’ Stevens, this is ‘the season of love and understanding’. But then old Shaky never had the Rangers annual general meeting in mind. Confirmation last night that Ally McCoist had been placed on gardening leave for the remainder of his contract adds a whole new dimension to what was always going to be a fractious event. Ally McCoist's departure, nine days after he offered his resignation, leaves more questions than it answers . The atmosphere is likely to be far from festive when the board sits in front of rank-and-file shareholders in the Bill Struth main stand this morning. Goodwill and charity are in scant supply among supporters angered by so much that has already happened and anxious about what comes next. There was a school of thought that McCoist’s presence at the meeting would be requested, almost to act as a lightning rod by deflecting some of the voltage away from the directors. That was ruled out when the end of his three-and-a-half-year tenure in charge — a spell unlike any other in the 142 years since Rangers were founded — was signalled in a club statement. Fittingly, given the current circumstances at Ibrox, the move both removed — and added — uncertainty. Despite declarations of business as usual, the idea of McCoist serving out his 12-month notice period was always unrealistic. It simply couldn’t work. Kenny McDowell (right) has taken over from McCoist but is unlikely to be a long term solution at Rangers . Rangers have now stated that assistant manager Kenny McDowall will be in charge until the end of the season. But then McDowall is no more part of the emerging new regime at Ibrox than McCoist was. The club’s desperate financial position severely limits their current options. It would seem logical, however, to predict that the next permanent manager will have Mike Ashley’s seal of approval. Indeed, Ashley will join McCoist in casting a shadow over Monday's annual meeting despite not being present in person. Mike Ashley, like McCoist, will be conspicuous in his absence at Monday's Annual General Meeting . His close ally, Derek Llambias, will be there after being upgraded from non-executive director to chief executive last Friday. But it remains to be seen whether any gifts of clarity about the way ahead will arrive from the top table. Ashley is the only man capable of playing Santa Claus at Ibrox these days, albeit his sack of goodies comes plastered with Sports Direct branding. Approval for a new share issue underwritten by the Newcastle United owner would help plug the £8million funding gap faced next year. It would also create a further issue in terms of Ashley’s past understanding with the SFA over his shareholding and influence. Yet if Rangers argue that Ashley is their single hope of solvency, then the governing body will be wedged between a rock and a hard place when it comes to renegotiating that agreement. Whatever unfolds on Monday, it will draw far more of a response from those filling the blue seats than Saturday’s pallid 2-0 victory over Livingston. This wasn’t exactly a valedictory triumph to savour, but at least McCoist can say he bowed out on a winning note. Rangers beat Livinstone 2-0 on Saturday, and sit second in the Championship table after 17 games . There were, however, no audible chants of support for him from those fans who bothered to turn up. Or, indeed, much noise about anything else. The official attendance of 28,053 could barely be delivered with a straight face. That figure presumes that all season-ticket holders had attended. In truth, it looked safe to lop around 10,000 off the total. One group in the Broomloan Road stand did direct some ire towards the directors, but it failed to catch on in other parts of the stadium. Disengagement is replacing outrage. It feels almost as if the club has been placed in suspended animation. The players have seemed to be part of that on too many occasions. For all that it becomes a mantra from within the dressing room, it is surely stretching credibility to think they can be unaffected by what goes on around them. The build-up to the Livingston game must have been another strange affair after McCoist handed in his notice 10 days ago. Fraser Aird (left) ensured McCoist departed Rangers on a winning note after three and a half years in charge . ‘It’s been hard and difficult, but as a player, you can only influence what you do when you cross that white line,’ said defender Darren McGregor, speaking on Saturday evening. ‘So, for us, it’s been training as normal and we’ve been listening to the experienced boys like Jig [Lee McCulloch] and Kenny [Miller], who make sure we’ re all on the right track. ‘You just train hard and look forward to the next game because that’s what it all boils down to. We need to keep focused to get results and climb up the table.’ A fine, angled finish from Fraser Aird had Rangers ahead at the break against the Championship’s bottom side. The winger’s second-half cross was then turned into his own net by Simon Mensing to complete the scoring in a very forgettable affair.","Ally McCoist finally left the club nine days after offering his resignation .

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League and Football League fixtures. 1. Arsenal’s problems keeping the ball at Anfield began from the back where goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who normally likes to roll the ball out to a defender to start play, was forced to kick it long. He launched all but two of 33 passes into Liverpool’s half – so not surprising that barely a third of them reached another Arsenal player. It set an uncharacteristic tone for the Gunners. Their total of just 36.5 per cent possession was the lowest total recorded by an Arsene Wenger side in a Premier League game since records began in 2003. Wojciech Szczesny contributed to Arsenal's poor possession record against Liverpool at Anfield . 2. Nobody works harder for a team than James Milner, even when he is asked to play out of position. The England midfielder responded to Manuel Pellegrini’s request to play at centre forward by making more sprints (71) than any other Manchester City player, and covering more miles (6.7) in his 82 minutes than all but Jesus Navas managed in 90. For good measure he set up Yaya Toure for the third goal and made two other chances in the 3-0 win over Palace. Manchester City midfielder James Milner put in a shift up-front against Crystal Palace on Saturday . 3. Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan has added a confidence coming off his line to his shot-stopping. The USA international made eight saves to help end Manchester United’s six-game winning run, but it was his willingness to catch crosses that made the biggest contribution as ten-man Villa held on to a 1-1 draw. Guzan used his 6ft 4ins frame to come out and make six catches in all – more than any other Premier League keeper this weekend. Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan makes one of eight saves in his side's 1-1 draw with Manchester United . 4. Will Buckley showed his determination to force his way back into Gus Poyet’s starting team with a match turning nine minutes after coming on for Sunderland at Newcastle. The 25-year-old, who followed Poyet from Brighton in the summer for just £2.5million, sprinted the length of the field to set up Adam Johnson’s dramatic winner seconds after heading away a corner on his own six yard box. He ran a remarkable 1.5 miles during his brief time on the pitch – and set up three other chances as well as the winning goal. Sunderland midfielder Will Buckley (right) wins the ball from Newcastle's Fabricio Coloccini at St James' Park . 5. Nigel Pearson can be a gambler if he’s chasing a game – he used all three subs at the same time with nearly half an hour left shortly after Stewart Downing had scored West Ham’s second goal. It’s the second time since bringing Leicester into the Premier League that he’s risked leaving himself with ten men if anybody gets injured. He did the same thing when his side were 2-0 down with 22 minutes to go at Swansea in October. Sadly for Pearson his boldness failed to change the game both times. On each occasion the Foxes went on to lose 2-0. Leicester boss Nigel Pearson made all three of his substitutions with almost 30 minutes left against West Ham . 6. Kyle Walker’s return from the abdominal injury that had kept him out since early March has added an extra attacking threat to Tottenham’s back four. The 24-year-old England full back played more accurate passes in Burnley’s half than any other Spurs defender in the 2-1 win over Burnley as Mauricio Pochettino’s side stretched their recent run to 16 points from eight games. Walker has recovered his pace since undergoing surgery, too. He recorded the quickest average speed of any Tottenham player. Fit-again Kyle Walker was Tottenham's quickest player in their 2-1 win against Burnley at White Hart Lane . 7. Swansea’s Garry Monk is still a relative rookie after less than a year as a Premier League boss but he’s not afraid to take big decisions. He made seven changes to the team that had unluckily lost to Spurs a week earlier – including dropping top scorer Wilfried Bony – for the trip to Hull and was rewarded with a 1-0 win. It’s fair to assume the Ivory Coast international will be back on Boxing Day, though. His one shot on target in a 14 minute cameo as a sub was more than Frenchman Bafetimbi Gomis managed in the previous 76 minutes. VIDEO Monk delighted by showing despite personnel change . Swansea boss Garry Monk decided to start top-scorer Wilfriend Bony on the bench against Hull City . 8. One of the first priorities on Eddie Howe’s list when he returned to Bournemouth two years ago was to persuade Marc Pugh to sign a new contract. The talented winger had previously turned down new deals insisting he wanted to play in a higher division. With just 18 months left on that agreement, it might be worth Howe talking to the 27-year-old again to tie him down a bit longer. Pugh has now hit six goals in the last nine games for the top of the Championship side. Bournemouth midfielder Marc Pugh (right) squeezes the ball past Blackpool goalkeeper Joe Lewis . 9. Peter Taylor’s status as a former England boss isn’t keeping too many critics off his back as Gillingham battle at the lower end of League One. The 61-year-old suffered abuse from Gills fans as his team clawed their way back from two down at home to Chesterfield only to lose to Jimmy Ryan’s volley. It seemed tough on Taylor – his team had been unbeaten in six matches before Saturday. Gillingham manager Peter Taylor is under pressure after a defeat by Chesterfield at home . 10. Yeovil might need to spend pretty quickly some of the £250,000 plus bounty that a glamour FA Cup tie with Manchester United will bring them. Four days after their efforts to win a replay with Accrington that secured the bonanza TV tie, Gary Johnson’s side lost 1-0 at home to relegation rivals Colchester. And with a Boxing Day trip to League One leaders Bristol City followed by another six-pointer against Leyton Orient, they could find themselves bottom of the table by the time Wayne Rooney and co turn up at Huish Park on January 4th.","James Milner made more sprints than any other Manchester City player .

"George Osborne has defended the deal that will leave Britain paying an extra £850 million towards the European Union budget - insisting it was a 'real win' despite accusations he has resorted to 'smoke and mirrors'. Critics claimed the reduction in the £1.7billion bill had been achieved by bringing forward a rebate to which the UK would have been entitled anyway. But the the Chancellor insisted there had been 'real doubt' over whether that clawback would apply to the surcharge. George Osborne has defended the deal that will leave Britain paying an extra £850 million towards the European Union budget . He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The truth is, as always, we have achieved a real win for British taxpayers and having achieved it everyone says 'oh, of course you were always going to achieve that'. 'But it took a lot of hard discussion, a lot of hard negotiation and it shows that when this government sets out a goal in Europe it goes and achieves it.' Mr Osborne said it was 'not clear' that the rebate was going to apply to the surcharge until the deal was struck in a summit with fellow EU finance ministers in Brussels. The hefty £1.7billion bill was demanded after a recalculation of Britain's gross national income (GNI) relative to the other 27 member states, . He said: 'It was a real doubt about whether the rebate would apply, apply to the extent it has applied. We have got this bill halved.'

Attack: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls responded to the deal by saying: 'David Cameron and George Osborne are trying to take the British people for fools' Asked if Britain's contributions to the EU were value for money, he replied: 'I don't think we get full value for money for all those pounds that get sent to the European Union.' Labour has claimed the deal does not save the UK 'a single penny' and accused Mr Osborne and the Prime Minister of 'trying to take the British people for fools'. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and Ukip leader Nigel Farage laid into George Osborne on Twitter yesterday . The Chancellor's European counterparts also appeared to contradict the Chancellor's account of the deal. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan said he believed that the UK 'will pay the whole amount' while Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said 'it's not as if the British have been given a discount'. The European Commission's vice-president with responsibility for the budget, Kristalina Georgieva, said the additional contribution being demanded from the UK meant that its rebate was also increased, leading to a 'downward correction' in the overall sum to be paid. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said on Twitter: 'David Cameron and George Osborne are trying to take the British people for fools. 'Ministers have failed to get a better deal for the British taxpayer. Not a single penny has been saved for the taxpayer compared to two weeks ago when David Cameron was blustering in Brussels. 'By counting the rebate Britain was due anyway, they are desperately trying to claim that the backdated bill for £1.7 billion has somehow been halved. Criticism: Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'Osborne (is) trying to spin his way out of disaster. UK still paying full £1.7 billion, his credibility is about to nose-dive. 'But nobody will fall for this smoke and mirrors. The rebate was never in doubt and, in fact, was confirmed by the EU Budget Commissioner last month.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage also weighed into the debate, posting on Twitter: 'Osborne (is) trying to spin his way out of disaster.

"A model who was arrested for stripping naked at the AFL Grand Final has blamed her racy antics on the fact she had consumed too much 'free alcohol' on the day. Scottish Heather McCartney, 26, who lives on the Gold Coast, took off all of her clothes and danced in a corporate box at the Melbourne Cricket Ground surrounded by hundreds of shocked sports fans on Saturday. The former Playboy model told Triple M radio she was not paid for the stunt following Hawthorn's big win over the Sydney Swans. 'I guess I got a bit carried away with all the free alcohol in the box,' McCartney said.

"Nicki Allwright died after her Mitsubishi sedam hit a tree on Gawler-One Tree Hill Road at Yattalunga . An outpouring of condolences have flooded social media for a family of a teenage girl who was killed after she swerved to miss a duck in Adelaide's north. University student Nicki Allwright died after her Mitsubishi sedan hit a tree on Gawler-One Tree Hill Road at Yattalunga on Friday. The horrific accident came just two days before she and her family were planning to jet off on a 10-day holiday to Bali. Ms Allwright - who was studying human movement at the University of South Australia - was eagerly counting down the days to the Indonesian island getaway. 'We've had a countdown going - 100 days, 80 days, 60 days and the last fortnight she was so excited, saying, ""Bali, Bali"" all the time,' the 19-year-old's mother, Marion, told The Advertiser. Mrs Allwright said her daughter was loved by all and shared a special bond with her 21-year-old sister, Sam. 'Nicki just loved her family, as we loved her,' she said. 'She loved being with Sam... they just adored each other. It's just so tragic — everybody just loved her.' Ms Allwright's siblings - 26-year-old Joel and Sam - and boyfriend of three years, George Blackett, have paid tribute to 'beautiful smiley Nicki' by changing their profile pictures to a photo of themselves and the teenager. The touching gesture sparked an outpouring of condolences for the family. Nicki's mother said the 19-year-old (right) shared a special bond with her 21-year-old sister, Sam . 'Your gorgeous little sister [was] a very welcome visitor at our house. Always with a smile on her face - gentle and kind, but gone too soon,' one friend wrote on Facebook. Another wrote: 'We are all in shock and disbelief, beautiful smiley Nicki. Sending you, Sam, your mum, dad and the whole family so much love xx.' Ms Allwright's parents have also called for the speed limit on Gawler-One Tree Hill Road to be lowered to 80km/h from 100km/h. Alan and Marion Allwright said too many young people had done along that stretch of road.

"U2 frontman Bono has defended Ireland's controversial business tax policies - claiming the large companies which avoid paying billions bring prosperity to the country. The tax deals Ireland struck with Apple in 1991 and 2007 have come under the microscope of the European Commission, which has warned Apple may yet be required to pay billions in backdated tax. In a letter released last month, it warned Ireland could be granting the company illegal rebates worth billions of dollars. Apple funnels the bulk of its international sales through subsidiaries in Ireland - where it benefits from low, negotiated tax deals. Scroll down for video . Bono (pictured) has defended his country's controversial business-friendly tax laws . But doubts have been raised over their compatibility with EU law as it is a practice the commission believes 'constitutes state aid'. But in an interview with the Observer, Bono has defended Ireland's business-friendly reputation and said the tax policies had brought the country prosperity by attracting people. He said: 'We are a tiny little country, we don’t have scale, and our version of scale is to be innovative and to be clever, and tax competitiveness has brought our country the only prosperity we’ve known. Bono was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 for his attempts to alleviate third world debt and has campaigned to raise AIDS awareness in Africa. He told the paper: 'We don’t have natural resources, we have to be able to attract people.' He added that Ireland had benefited from 'more hospitals and firemen and teachers because of [the tax] policies'. If the commission ruled Apple had to repay some taxes, the money would come as a windfall to Irish state coffers. Merrion Street: The European Commission has written a letter to the Irish government stating that tax arrangements between the Republic and Apple may not be compatible with EU law . Irish presence: Apple has a large distribution centre on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Cork . However, fearful of losing its reputation as a business-friendly country with low corporate taxes, the Irish government is adamant that no EU rules have been breached. Scrutiny over corporate tax avoidance has risen to the top of the political agenda in the United States and Europe in recent years. Apple employs 4,000 people at a manufacturing plant in Cork, south-west Ireland, its only such facility outside of the United States. Apple paid an average tax rate of just 2.5 percent on around $109 billion of non-U.S. profits in the past five years - a fraction of Ireland's 12.5 percent tax rate.","U2 frontman claims controversial business tax laws bring Ireland prosperity .

"Researchers from Oxford University discovered birds with similar personalities flock together by tracking great tits, pictured, around Wytham Woods . Birds choose their friends and mates based not only on species, but also by personality, according to new research. Shy male great tits tend to seek the company of other birds with the same disposition, claim scientists from Oxford University, while introverted adolescent birds are more likely to avoid the party crowd and keep to their own. Researchers made the discovery after tracking thousands of birds with radio tags around Wytham Woods near Oxford, in a bid to map their social networks. The study also found that shy birds of both sexes, while having smaller groups of 'friends' than their bolder counterparts, tended to form more stable relationships. Lucy Aplin, from the university, said: 'There has been a lot of work describing the range of individual personalities in the great tit. 'Now we are linking it to the social networks and social organisation of the species, which hasn't been done before.' The scientists recorded millions of visits made by the birds to 65 feeding stations over an entire winter to see how they interacted socially. Birds were rated on a personality scale ranging from shy to bold, and individuals tested by introducing them to new environments. Typically shy birds explored a strange environment very slowly, whereas bold birds carried out their recces quickly. The birds' personalities were found to influence their social behaviour. Bolder and more outgoing birds chose quantity over quality in their relationships. They had weaker associations with more birds than shy individuals, and foraged with several different groups. 'Measuring the social networks we could see that bolder birds tended to hop between foraging flocks and have short-term foraging associations, while shy birds tended to maintain a foraging association over a long time,' said Aplin. Birds were rated from shy to bold. Typically shy birds explored a strange environment slowly, whereas bold birds carried out their recces quickly. Bolder and more outgoing birds chose quantity over quality in their relationships. While shy great tits, similar to the ones pictured, formed fewer but stronger bonds . Recent research from Laval University . in Canada found that birds observe speed limits on roads even if . motorists choose to ignore them. On roads with higher speed limits, . birds are quicker to take to the air to avoid oncoming traffic, but . where limits are lower, they wait longer. The behaviour is related to speed restrictions and not the result of birds assessing the speed of approaching vehicles. 'Shy birds are following a social strategy where they maintain a few strong and stable social associations to minimise risk. 'Hopping between many flocks may increase risks for bolder birds, but might maximise rewards through improving their social position and giving them better access to information, such as the location of food.' While shy male birds tended to gravitate to similar individuals, shy females associated freely with all personalities, she said. She added: 'We think shy male birds might group together to avoid the more aggressive bold birds.' Professor Ben Sheldon, director of the Edward Grey Institute at Oxford University's Department of Zoology, said: ''By uncovering the way that different types of individuals interact non-randomly, we hope to understand how this controls the way that many processes work within populations. 'For instance, the way that information, and disease, spread in populations depends on the structure of the social network, and our work now tells us part of the reason for that structure.' The findings are reported in the journal Ecology Letters.","Researchers tracked thousands of great tits in Wytham Woods, Oxford .

"The taxpayers' bill for ferrying prisoners around in taxis leapt by almost 10 per cent last year, it emerged tonight. The Ministry of Justice admitted that in 2013-14 it spent £3.4million on taxis for inmates, up from £3.1million a year earlier, but insisted it was an 'economical mode of transport'. The revelation is especially embarrassing after a Treasury minister last year said the bill was a 'scandal'. The bill for taxis for prisoners last year hit £3.4million, the highest since the first year of the coalition . Ministers insisted using taxis was an 'economical' way of transporting criminals, instead of buying dedicated prison vehicles. According to figures released in response to a parliamentary question, the bill for taxis for prisoners came to £3,417,595, up from £3,133,614 last year. It is the highest the bill has been since the first year of the coalition. When last year's sum was revealed, Tory MP Priti Patel called it a 'scandal'. She is now a minister at the Treasury, which has demanded a tighter grip on spending. The figure is for the cost of transporting prisoners for public sector prisons in England and Wales. Tonight Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money is already paid to private companies to ferry around prisoners, and so the public will be confused why an additional £3million had to be shelled out last year for taxis for prisoners. 'Many people are struggling to pay their bills on a day to day basis, and taking a taxi for them is a rare luxury. 'They will look at offenders being shuttled around in taxis and question what has gone wrong with the world. 'We need competent Ministers who know what they are doing rather than this shower. 'This is yet more evidence of the shambles at the Ministry of Justice. David Cameron's government really do need to get a grip before any more of the hard pressed British public’s money is wasted.' Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan  said for most normal people a taxi is a 'luxury' The Prisoner Escort Custody Service (PECS) is responsible for moving prisoners around the country, between prisons, police stations and courts and their care and security while in court custody. It runs contracts for secure escorts for all inmates, apart from Category A prisoners. But sometimes taxis are hired to drive them around instead of standard prison vans. Prisons minister Andrew Selous said: 'There are occasions when the prison service may make use of taxis to provide prisons with a cost-effective, flexible way of fulfilling transport requirements for prisoners where there is a strong operational justification for doing so. 'This is an economical mode of transport (particularly in comparison with using cellular vehicles or purchasing cars). It reduces potential overhead costs for prisons, such as maintenance and cleaning, which have an impact on staff time. 'Prisons are able to access this form of transport at short notice, in response to urgent requirements.'","EXCLUSIVE: Spending on hired transport and taxis hit £3.4million last year .

"Mary Galvin, 67, admitted taking the money from the two elderly women at Lyndon Residential Care Home . A former nurse stole thousands of pounds from vulnerable elderly women at the care home she managed, claiming they used heaters too much or owed her money for sleeping in a double bed. Mary Galvin, 67, claimed she took the money from two residents at the Greater Manchester care home, which has now been closed, because she was told she had been undercharging then. She pilfered £3,000 from a 94-year-old woman because she felt she was using the heater excessively and that the pensioner owed her more because she was a single resident and slept in a single room. Another woman had £3,500 taken directly from her bank account without being informed first . Bolton Crown Court heard that Galvin, who ran Lyndon Residential Care Home, had managed to take the money because she had direct access to residents' bank accounts to take their fees. Judge Timothy Stead said that by helping herself to the money Galvin had 'breached a high degree of trust.' The problems started at the home in 2011 when nine deaths registered at the 16-bed residential home meant a loss of income and financial difficulties for Galvin. The home had to be sold after a police investigation into the thefts uncovered how Galvin had misused her access to the accounts. At Bolton Crown Court Galvin, of Whitefield, pleaded guilty to theft but escaped prison. The court heard Galvin and her husband bought the care home in 1997, after she had spent 30 years working as a nurse. But Hugh Edwards, prosecuting, said Galvin had carried out the thefts after being given access to the residents' bank accounts in order to take their fees. He said the amounts taken were 'over and above what she was allowed to withdraw'. Defending Galvin,  Philip Parry said she had been suffering mental health problems, following her son taking his own life in August 2012, and her daughter battling alcoholism. The court heard she had since paid back the money back in full to the two estates of the victims. He added that the defendant was of fragile mentality and needs to see a psychiatrist. Mr Parry added: 'Mrs Galvin's use and misuse of bank accounts of two complainants was initially permitted. It wasn't a case where she helped herself to the money. 'The basis of the plea and the prosecution accepted, there was a time when both residents paid fees by cheque.' Mary Galvin pictured leaving Bolton Crown Court . But he added that there came a time when they didn't and Galvin was allowed to take the money. 'There was an agreement that allowed her to take the money for the accounts to the sum of the fees. The dishonesty accumulated over a year, the taking of money went beyond what she was permitted to take in lieu.' Galvin was sentenced to 20 months in prison suspended for two years. She must also complete 100 hours unpaid work and pay £60 costs and a statutory victim surcharge of £100. Judge Timothy Stead told her: 'I seriously hope that this is the last time you stand in the dock. What you did in stealing money from vulnerable persons in your care, you knew well to be wrong. As far as the courts are concerned the theft breached a high degree of trust.' After the case Labour Councillor Simon Carter who represents the Tottington ward said: 'I can't see how anybody should descend the conduct of running a care home like that and acting like that. You have to build a business model and you have to predict the unpredictable, if there is a loss of income you don't start nicking money off residents you go to the bank. 'It's reprehensible. She was exploiting people who were clearly vulnerable. I imagine from what I read about social care it's not cheap. It's a serious breach of trust - you can't put a gloss on it - you can't tell it in any other way. I'm sorry it came to that but nobody made her do it.'","Mary Galvin stole thousands from accounts of elderly residents, one aged 94 .

"It is one of the smallest self-governing territories in the world and is home to just 30,000 people but that hasn't prevented Gibraltar from launching its own beauty pageant. Indeed, Miss Gibraltar has been running since 1959 when Viola Abudarham took the title and, in 2009, spawned the winner of Miss World in the (perfectly formed) shape of Kaiane Aldorino. Now James Neish, 39, one of the organisers of the 2014 edition, has revealed what working on one of the world's smallest beauty pageants is really like. Glamorous: Miss Gibraltar organiser James Neish with the eight women who entered this year's competition . Mr Neish, who appears on Channel 5's Gibraltar: Britain in the Sun tonight, has been involved with the competition since 2003 and says it is one of the highlights of the British Overseas Territory's social calendar. Nevertheless, with a tiny pool of candidates to choose from - and an even smaller selection of judges - he says making it happen isn't always easy. 'All pageants come with their challenges,' he admits. 'It’s really important to remain fair and impartial so we ask the Ministry of Culture to fly judges in from abroad. 'In such a small community it would be impossible to recruit judges who didn't know at least one of the contestants.' Looking good: Judges put the Miss Gibraltar competitors through their paces in the swimsuit round . Finding enough candidates can also prove challenging, with the Territory's small population limiting the pool - particularly as British women and those from neighbouring Spain aren't allowed in unless they live permanently in Gibraltar. Despite the challenges, Mr Neath says he loves working on the show which he describes as a 'big social occasion' and a cross between Sunday Night at the Palladium and Britain's Next Top Model. Girls taking part in this year's event 22-year-old teaching assistant Shyanne Azzopardi, who says entering the competition is a 'childhood dream' and Kristy Torres, a 23-year-old student teacher. But, says Mr Neath, for the girls to emerge triumphant, they're going to need more than a pretty face and fabulous figure. 'Confidence, personality and I think, above all, coming across as genuine are important factors,' he explains. 'A good performance  - in short, someone who has taken direction from the producers and then delivered on stage  - is also important. Beautiful: Miss Gibraltar entrants Shyanne Azzopardi, 22, (left) and 23-year-old Kristy Torres (right) Winning ways:  Gibraltar has produced one Miss World winner, although neighbouring Spain has had none . 'Gibraltarian women generally have a real charm and a Mediterranean feel about them. Even so, it's not just about looks.' Good looks notwithstanding, Mr Neath also says there's more to becoming a beauty queen - in Gibraltar at least - than turning up at photo shoots. 'The pageant has to reflect much more than just physical beauty,' he says, passionately. 'Talent, personality and, most importantly, charity work are all taken into account. 'Indeed, for the past few years, we have asked each contestant to represent a charity [on stage], which has been an enriching experience for everyone. 'Normally none, or very few, of the young women who embark on the Miss Gibraltar journey have done public speaking before. Small pool: Judges have to be flown in from abroad while, thanks to the small population, just eight enter . 'When you see them stand in front of hundreds - knowing thousands are watching at home  - and they  passionately talk about their charities, it is proof that beauty queens really can make a difference and matter for much more than their looks.' Nevertheless, the man from the tiny territory that has produced as many Miss World winners as France, Finland and Israel - and more than neighbouring Spain which has had none - says looks are one of the reasons for his country's success. 'Are Gibraltarian women among the world’s most beautiful?' he says. 'That’s an easy one! Yes, yes, yes!' Not only did Britain invent Miss World, it has won it more times than any other nation barring one - Venezuela. British beauties won the title in 1961, 1964, 1965, 1974 and 1983, although recent years have proved less fruitful. Nevertheless, British winners have triumphed on more occasions than almost anyone else, with India taking third place on the winner's podium behind the UK and Venezuela and the US in fourth. Other countries to enjoy multiple wins include Sweden, Iceland, China, Russia and Australia, all of which have won twice or three times. Along with Gibraltar, one-off winners include Germany, Egypt, Finland, France and Brazil, as well as Israel and the Philippines. Despite being home to approximately 46 million people, neighbouring Spain - which dwarfs tiny Gibraltar - has never managed to produce a winner.","The yearly Miss Gibraltar competition attracts just eight entrants each time .

"Just two days before Chelsea Leonard gave birth to her first child, her world fell apart. The expectant mother, excited at her impending arrival, was devastated when doctors told her she had stomach cancer. Less than a year later - and three weeks after she married partner Matthew - she lost her life after a precious few months with Willow Grace. Mrs Leonard, 26, died two weeks before she could celebrate her daughter's first birthday. Scroll down for video . Chelsea Leonard, 26, died after an 11-month battle with stomach cancer, three weeks after marrying partner Matthew, and just two weeks before their daughter Willow celebrated her first birthday . Miss Leonard was diagnosed with the disease two days before baby Willow Grace was born last July . But she lost her battle knowing her longed-for daughter would grow up in the first home she bought with her husband. Mr Leonard, a litigation lawyer, is now raising money in memory of his wife, who he described as 'gorgeous and popular, with a smile that could light up a room'. It was last July, when she was 37 weeks pregnant, that the couple got the terrible news. During her pregnancy, Mrs Leonard had complained of suffering repeated dizzy spells. Doctors initially said the symptoms were the result of her expecting a baby. But a blood test revealed she had a very low iron count. A scan then found a tumour lurking in Mrs Leonard's stomach. Two days later baby Willow was born, and her mother began her fight to survive. But to the couple's horror, further scans revealed the disease had already spread to her liver. Mr Leonard, 32, said: 'If I can bring Willow up to be half as strong, considerate, brave and kind-hearted as Chelsea, I'll have done a good job. 'Once she knew the cancer was terminal, she took the view she just had to get on with it. 'She focused on spending as much time with Willow as she possibly could - she stayed strong for her.' She had suffered dizzy spells during her pregnancy, but doctors had put the symptoms down to her expecting a baby. But when a blood test revealed she had a low iron count, she was referred for a scan which showed a tumour in her stomach. After Willow's birth further scans revealed the cancer had spread to her liver . Stomach cancer is a relatively rare form of the disease, affecting around 7,300 people in the UK each year. The early symptoms are vague and easy to mistake for other, less serious conditions. They include: . As the disease develops, more advanced symptoms include: . In many cases, due to the face the early symptoms are so similar to other conditions, the disease is often advanced by the time it is detected. It is vital people suffering the early symptoms get checked by their GP as soon as possible. There are different types of stomach cancer - 95 per cent of cases develop in the cells of the stomach lining - known as adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Less common forms of the disease include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue and gastrointestinal stromal tumours, which develop in the muscle of the stomach wall. Around 15 per cent of stomach cancer patients live at least five years after diagnosis, and around 11 per cent live for 10 years. In the UK around 5,000 people die from stomach cancer each year. Source: NHS Choices . The couple met in 2004 while both working at Sheffield law firm Irwin Mitchell. Mr Leonard then proposed on the first night they spent together in the house they bought in Ulley, Rotherham, where he is now raising Willow on his own. He added: 'We wanted to get a house in a nice area for Willow to grow up in, and so Chelsea could be comfortable in the knowledge we had got off on the right foot in our home.' The couple tied the knot in June in front of 150 friends and family at Aston Hall, near Sheffield. But less than a month later Mrs Leonard passed away. 'Chelsea enjoyed the wedding day but she was really struggling with pain at that point,' Mr Leonard said. 'She put on a brave face and looked stunning. 'She had to keep going for rests, but we spaced out the day a little so it was as relaxing as it could be for her.' Mrs Leonard, who grew up in Killamarsh, near Sheffield,  lost her own mother to cancer as a child. She had repeated bouts of chemotherapy and agreed to take part in a clinical test to contain or reduce the size of the tumours. The treatment was showing promise, until  her last trial scan, which showed the tumour in her liver had suddenly grown. Over time, the cancer spread to her bones. At her weakest point, she was admitted to specialist cancer centre The Christie Hospital in Manchester. Her husband, who is making memory boxes  for Willow, so she will know what her mother was like, said: 'It's been really difficult but I've had no time to wallow. 'I've got to get up every morning to look after Willow, who is a positive focus. 'But I'll always think about what might have been if the cancer was detected earlier, and what we would be doing if she was still here now.' More than 300 people attended Mrs Leonard's funeral, including family, friends and colleagues from Irwin Mitchell, where she worked as a legal clerk from the age of 17. Workmates will be taking part in the Great Yorkshire Run on Sunday to raise money for the The Christie Hospital.

"CLAXTON By Mark Cocker (Jonathan Cape £14.99) A Jay perched on a stump in Norfolk woodland . Claxton is a small village eight miles south-east of Norwich and, when naturalist Mark Cocker moved there 13 years ago, the population numbered just 244. Yet that simple statement is wholly deceptive — for what are a few human households compared with the teeming world of plant, insect, bird and animal life that also inhabits the area? At the end of this series of Field Notes From A Small Planet, Cocker supplies complete lists of the species he has recorded in his parish: fungi, plants, slugs, snails, millipedes, spiders, grasshoppers, butterflies, moths, micro-moths (yes!), beetles, flies, ants, bees, wasps, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals. And more. Like a geek I started to count them all, then abandoned the task. But it won’t come as a surprise to any gardener to know there are 11 sorts of slugs and snails. Cocker finds fascination and majesty, if not beauty, in everything. In light of what we know about how species are threatened, this Norfolk richness might seem miraculous — yet there is more to this story than numbers. Claxton is a beautifully-written account of one man’s passion for the natural world, a collection of precise, monthly observations, but also subtle warnings that unless we treat nature with respect, we will pay the price. In that context, the author’s meticulous lists are a form of evidence. I have no doubt that, within 20 years, he and his friends will be checking to see what remains unthreatened. Mark Cocker has written nature columns for many years and locates the reader by his side on his walks through the Norfolk countryside . Cocker has written nature columns for many years, and while this is, in some ways, a collection of that journalism, it is much more. Observations from different years are arranged month-by-month to build an overview of how the year turns in the author’s beloved place. He explains: ‘It is also a celebration of the way in which a particular location can give shape and meaning to one’s whole outlook.’ So inspiring is this process, so completely does Cocker locate you by his side on his walks, I confess that the few excursions outside Norfolk didn’t work for me; you really don’t want to be dragged from his East coast world to Morocco, Greece, Buxton or the M6 near Birmingham. Cooker describes the ‘dog-like calls’ of geese overhead and takes in his natural surroundings in perfect prose . What you do want is imaginatively to stand beside him as (in January) he hears the ‘dog-like calls’ of geese overhead (how precise that is) and watches thousands of rooks roosting — recording their movements in masterly prose: ‘And they fell earthwards, almost uncontrollably, so that they reminded me of some last bonfire of a lifetime’s papers, each charred page rising, falling and twisting in a vent of boiled air.’ Magnificent. In March, he watched lapwings ‘twist and rock crazily over the Earth’ and their wild cries remind him of a beloved friend who has recently died. The joy he sees in the birds’ movements has a profoundly healing effect. Yet, Cocker adds sadly, ‘as a society we have yet to value truly or to find a means to harness fully’ the succour the natural world can offer to human sorrow. Cocker is mad about the humblest moth, views trees as infinitely generous in their gifts, marvels at the fact that jays plant 5,000 acorns every autumn (for later retrieval) and even counts the radials on a spider’s web, calculating that she had linked her silk lines 1,332 times to make the sphere. In March, he watched lapwings ‘twist and rock crazily over the Earth’ and their wild cries remind him of a beloved friend who has recently died . His powers of patient observation are thrilling, and he lures you outside, wherever you live — that’s his intention: ‘My hope is that readers might be inspired to look more closely at their own immediate surroundings.’ He is no sentimentalist. On the contrary, he rages against ignorance and neglect. Noting that half our thrushes have gone in the past 30 years, he asks: ‘Why are we so complacent about our loss of wildlife? What price should we put on the song thrush’s priceless song? How dare we not make that song a political issue?’ Do politicians care about our wildlife? He thinks not — which is why I’d give every MP this exceptional book in their Christmas stocking.","Mark Cocker has written nature columns for many years .

"Buffering videos and slow downloads are the bane of the web, even in areas that promise superfast speeds. But this could soon be a thing of the past after researchers created a network so fast - it could download a file in just 0.03 milliseconds. By comparison, the blink of an eye takes 300 milliseconds. The advanced technology uses fibre with seven different cores to transfer 255 terabits of data every second. Researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) have used a seven-core fibre network to transfer data at a record-high of 225 terabits per second (Tbps). Current fibre networks (pictured) typically use single cores and achieve a commercial maximum of 100Gbps . This is 2,550 times faster than the 100Gbps currently offered as the maximum achievable speeds on single-core, commercial networks. And to put this into perspective, the average web speed globally is only a meagre 3.9Mbps. The advanced technology fibre uses seven different cores through which light can travel, instead of the single core typically used. During tests, its transferred 255 terabits of data every second. This is 2,550 times faster than the 100Gbps offered as the current commercial maximum. Put simply, it’s similar to sending thousands of cars down a seven-lane motorway, compared to a single-track road. Researchers also introduced two additional so-called ‘orthogonal dimensions’ - the equivalent of driving three cars on top of one another in the same lane. The breakthrough was achieved by researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and the University of Central Florida (CREOL). Their new fibre has seven different cores through which the light can travel, instead of the single core typically used in current state-of-the-art fibre networks. Put simply, it’s the equivalent of sending thousands of cars down a seven-lane highway, compared to a single-track road. The researchers also introduced two additional so-called ‘orthogonal dimensions’ - the equivalent of driving three cars on top of one another in the same lane. By combining these methods, the network topped out at 255Tbps. Lead researcher, Dr. Chigo Okonkwo said: ‘At less than 200 microns in diameter, this fibre does not take noticeably more space than conventional fibres already deployed. The advanced fibre uses seven cores (pictured) through which light can travel, instead of the single core typically used. Researchers also introduced two so-called ‘orthogonal dimensions’. This is the equivalent to driving three cars on top of each other on a seven-lane motorway, compared to a single-track road . ‘These remarkable results definitely give the possibility to achieve Petabits/s transmission.’ However, these speeds were the maximum achieved in controlled tests. To achieve such speeds in the real world would mean upgrading routers, devices and websites to handle the extra demand. The findings are published in the journal Nature Photonics. These latest speeds build on the research from Technical University of Denmark which, in July, achieved 43Tbps using the seven-core fibre.","Researchers from Eindhoven  have developed a multi-core fibre network .

Heath Cassidy (above) was terrified for his fiancee and wandered the bushland for three hours calling Ms Fraser's name before he called the police . The pair had met in 2006 and had gotten engaged only two days before Ms Fraser disappeared . She stormed off into the bush with her towel to calm herself down, and as she was tired from the day's activities, she soon fell asleep. Ms Fraser woke at dusk, and soon became disoriented and lost, unable to find the track leading back to the reserve as the light faded. 'I had no way of telling where I was', Ms Fraser told Sunday Night. Panicking as the darkness fell, Ms Fraser pushed through the dense forest and was soon covered in cuts and scratches, and had her clothes ripped off her by the unforgiving shrubbery and plants inhabiting the area. Ms Fraser's fiancee, Mr Cassidy, was frantically trying to find her, and wandered around the bush for three hours calling her name before he called the police. ‘I looked around the whole park area and couldn’t see he,' he said. ‘My heart started beating very fast…I got in a panic. I couldn’t believe she was gone, but I didn’t know what to think.' Panicking as the darkness fell, Ms Fraser pushed through the dense forest and was soon covered in cuts and scratches, and had her clothes ripped off her by the unforgiving shrubbery and plants inhabiting the area. The inhospitable rainforest is home to poisonous spiders, snakes, leeches, cassowaries, and crocodiles. Rescue helicopters had been called in by police, but the sound of the creek drowned the noise of the choppers and the cries of the searchers brought in to look for Ms Fraser . Mr Cassidy was especially concerned as the  inhospitable rainforest was home to poisonous spiders, snakes, leeches, cassowaries, and crocodiles. Aware of the dangers that the river could pose, Ms Fraser headed inland, at this point completely naked, and soaked from the torrential downpour soaking the area. Rescue helicopters had been called in by police, but the sound of the creek drowned the noise of the choppers and the cries of the searchers brought in to look for Ms Fraser. Acting Superintendent Rhys Newton was concerned for her safety, given that Ms Fraser had no working phone, no food, and was lost in an area notorious for being unforgiving. ‘From day one I thought she was in trouble,' Superintendent Newton said. After seven days in the bush, Ms Fraser began to experience severe hunger pains, and was feeling weak and exhausted from the constant walking and exposure to the elements. She said she would often try to sleep as soon as the sun began to sink so she didn't have to experience being lost and alone in the dark. 'The nights were the scariest because it was pitch black, that’s how dark the jungle is,' she said. ‘I just wanted to go home…I cried for my dad a lot, and kept thinking that I miss my family, I miss my kids.' ‘I kept seeing pictures of my youngest girl as a baby. I knew she would be taking it the hardest.' ‘I just wanted to go home…I cried for my dad a lot, and kept thinking that I miss my family, I miss my kids,' said Ms Fraser . Ms Fraser pictured with three of her children . ‘I kept seeing pictures of my youngest girl as a baby. I knew she would be taking it the hardest,' Ms Fraser said . Ms Fraser's mother Deidree spoke to the media seven days after her daughter went missing, and said that she suspected there had been foul play. Ms Cassidy said he believed Ms Fraser's family thought he was involved in her disappearance, which grieved him as he soldiered on looking for his fiancee. It was hard knowing that they’re pretty much thinking that I’ve done something. I was in and out of interviews with police,' he said. Ms Cassidy was adamant that Ms Fraser was still alive, and took a beloved photo of his fiancee with him wherever he went. 'I knew she was alive. I could feel it. There was a reason why I could feel it, it’s because she’s got a hand over my heart,' he told Sunday Night. Twelve days after she went missing, Ms Fraser decided to face her fear of crocodiles and head down to the water to see if she could find her way out by following the river. After swimming downstream all day, she crawled onto a rock in the middle of the river and slept there, waking up the next morning to discover she had begun to menstruate. Terrified of attracting crocodiles, Ms Fraser huddled on the rock for three days until her bleeding stopped, exposed to the sun and debilitating heat. She suffered intense sunburns, which added to her litany of other injuries which she had accumulated after nearly two weeks lost in the bush. ‘I did a lot of soul searching, praying to see my kids again. Making deals with God to let me out,' Ms Fraser said. Fifteen days after Ms Fraser disappeared, the search for her was suspended, and her family began to face the reality that she might never be coming home. The mother-of-four was also facing sure defeat, naked, weak and half-starved, delirious with hunger and exhaustion, covered with cuts and bruises that were now infected. ‘I sat down on the ground that morning, and I thought I can’t get out, I’m going to die out here,' she said. Ms Cassidy was adamant that Ms Fraser was still alive, and took a beloved photo of his fiancee with him wherever he went . 'I knew she was alive. I could feel it. There was a reason why I could feel it, it’s because she’s got a hand over my heart,' he said . ‘I'm so happy to be home with family, I couldn’t wish for more than that,' said Ms Fraser . 'But something told me to get up. I got up and I walked all that day.’ On the sixteenth day after she wandered into the dense scrubland, she spotted a pink ribbon which had been used by searchers to mark where they had looked for Ms Fraser. The next day, after following the markers all the way back to the path, Ms Fraser emerged into the car park when she had been 17 days before. ‘When I ran down I saw the one car in the car park, but I stopped because I didn’t want to scare the driver,' she said. 'But he opened the door right away and said, everyone's been looking for you.' Ms Fraser was rushed to Innisfail Hospital, where she was treated for an extensive array of injuries. 'When my family came in and tried to hug me, I started screaming ""Don't touch me"". My body was on fire.' Her appearance had changed dramatically, due to the bites and scratches which were now infected, her severe sunburn, and her significant weight loss.' 'They weighed me when I came into the hospital and I had lost 17 kilos in 17 days.' ‘She looked like a wild woman,' Ms Cassidy said. 'It took me a couple of minutes to realise it was her, she looked so different.' Ms Fraser said she was very pleased to see her fiancee, but was too busy eating to pay him the full attention he deserved. ‘He was crying and I was eating my soup. I was more worried about the soup,' she said. Mr Cassidy said that he always knew she would return to him, and could not express how thankful he was to have her back. ‘This girl is strong, I’m telling you. I feel so relieved shes’ back, its amazing. A miracle,' he said. Ms Fraser said that she knew he would be waiting for her to come home. ‘He’s my world, he didn’t give up on me,' she said. ‘I'm so happy to be home with family, I couldn’t wish for more than that' ‘I feel like I've grown a bit wiser. I think I've aged a bit too. I wont take life for granted again. Life’s too short.'","Ms Fraser became lost in dense bushland after wandering off from the fishing spot where she had spent the day with her fiancee .
Her clothes were ripped from her by the unforgiving native plants and she was left naked in the bush without food or a way to contact anyone .
The bush was home to many dangerous animals such as snakes, spiders, leeches, cassowaries and crocodiles .
A huge search party was organised who looked for her for 15 days before it was called off when many believed she had died in the bush .
She suffered many injuries including bites, scratches, severe sunburn and infections and lost 17 kilos from the ordeal .
After 17 days lost in the bush she finally emerged and was reunited with her fiancee and children ."
"Roy Hodgson is backing Wayne Rooney to go on to break Peter Shilton’s England caps record as he prepares to make his 100th appearance against Slovenia a week on Saturday. The Manchester United striker will earn his golden cap in the Euro 2016 qualifier, taking him to just 25 appearances short of the mark set by the goalkeeper. At 29, time could be against Rooney but Hodgson is convinced Shilton’s record is set to fall. England captain Wayne Rooney will win his 100th cap against Slovenia next week . Rooney could go on to become England's most capped player ever according to manager Roy Hodgson . The Manchester United striker made his debut in 2003 at the age of 17, in a friendly against Australia . The England manager said: ‘I think he could (do it). We play on average 10 games a year and in two years’ time he will be 30 or 31. That is no age for a player today. ‘I would say Peter Shilton’s record is in danger. Generally the record for caps It is always held by a goalkeeper so it will be some achievement if a forward can take the record. It would be a great achievement and I would back him to do it.’ Rooney has scored 43 times for his country in the past 11 years since his debut . The forward, England captain since last summer's World Cup, has played in the tournament three times . Hodgson has handed Theo Walcott his first England call for a year and did not rule out giving the Arsenal winger some playing time as he returns from a serious knee injury. Saido Berahino has also been rewarded for his excellent form at West Brom, with Daniel Sturridge absent with a calf injury. Hodgson’s relationship with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has drawn much scrutiny over the Raheem Sterling ‘fatigue’ affair. Hodgson said: ‘Daniel Strurridge was never a realistic possibility as he is still recovering from his calf injury he picked up, which is unfortunate. We were hoping of course to get him back but it hasn’t worked out. Peter Shilton is currently England's record cap holder, having played 125 times for his country . Shilton's international career lasted 20 years, but Hodgson believes Rooney can pass his cap record . 'Our medical staff have had contact and I left a message for Brendan. The message was pretty obvious that he is not fit. Brendan has not rung back to counter that he actually is fit.’ Asked when he left the message, Hodgson said: ‘Only last night I left a message, basically to tell him that when I name the squad that Daniel Sturridge is unfit. 'There was no need to call me back, just to let him know that I understood Daniel wasn’t fit for this game so if I got any questions today the answers I give would be ones he understands and be happy with.’ Daniel Sturridge is close to a Liverpool return, but is still not fit enough to play for England yet . Hodgson defended his decision to reveal that Raheem Sterling missed an England game because he was tired . On the back of the issues surrounding Sterling’s absence from the qualifier in Estonia, Hodgson insisted his relationship with the forward is good. Hodgson said: ‘I speak to Raheem all the time. As far as I am concerned that chapter, which was an unfortunate one, is over. I have nothing to say or add. ‘We will both probably learn from it though I don’t understand how it is mistake to tell the truth when asked why you have not chosen a player.’ Walcott has joined the England squad with Arsene Wenger’s blessing. Hodgson did not rule out using him against Slovenia or Scotland, though his role is likely to be limited to fitness work. Theo Walcott has returned to the England squad, despite only making one substitute appearance this season . Walcott has been out since January, when he injured his knee in an FA Cup tie against Tottenham . Hodgson said: ‘Theo over the past two and a half years has been important. He is continuing with a fitness plan that we will follow while he is with us. ‘We have given the club that guarantee and Arsene is happy for us to take him. I spoke to Theo on Wednesday and said how pleased I was. I can’t guarantee him minutes but that is no guarantee that he won’t get minutes. If he is feeling fit and we can use him we will.’ Hodgson also explained that Berahino's inclusion, for the first time at senior level, was based on his form in the Premier League and for Gareth Southgate's Under 21 side, and suggested the West Brom striker will get game time. 'The reasons are quite obvious, not only because he’s done so well for his club but for the Under 21s team too. Saido Berahino has earned his first senior call-up, on the back of excellent form for the U21 side . Berahino has also been in good goalscoring form for his club, scoring seven Premier League goals . 'He’s been in good form and he has been in our mind since the last get-together. The Under 21s only have a friendly so I saw no reason not to bring him in now. 'There is no point bringing these players in if they don’t have a chance to play. He will hope to but he faces competition from the other strikers too.'","Rooney is set to win his 100th cap against Slovenia next week .

"Pawned: David James Montgomery, 58, pawned a laptop with a CD containing 14 homemade pornographic videos of him and a young girl . A Maryland man faces charges after child pornography was found on a CD left in a laptop he pawned, authorities say. On September 10, David James Montgomery, 58, of Hagerstown, pawned a laptop with a CD containing 14 homemade pornographic videos of a preteen girl. Montgomery was arrested Thursday and is charged with possession of child pornography, soliciting a subject for child pornography, permitting a subject to take part in child pornography, and child pornography depicting a sex act, according to Washington County District Court records. If found guilty, Montgomery could spend 35 years in prison, the total maximum sentence for the four charges. The Herald-Mail Media reports that a pawn shop employee found the CD in Montgomery's laptop and 'expected it to be music.' He then played it in another computer and saw that the CD contained a video of Montgomery 'directing a young girl to do sexual things.' Police began to investigate Montgomery after being called to the Washington Street Pawnbrokers in Hagerstown and, after investigating the incident, authorities obtained a search warrant for Montgomery's residence where they reportedly found other media and discs. Montgomery turned himself in and admitted to making the videos but said that he never had physical contact with the girl nor did he share the videos which were all allegedly recorded August 2. Montgomery reportedly told investigators that he had forgotten he left the videos on his computer. Admitted: Montgomery admitted to making the videos but said that he never had physical contact with the young girl nor did he share any of the videos . Herald-Mail reports that the preteen victim has been interviewed by police and Montgomery could face additional felony charges when the grand jury reconvenes. Assistant Public Defender Elizabeth Steiner told the Herald-Mail that Montgomery has no criminal record and asked the judge to place Montgomery on home detention, or make his bail unsecured or lower it, at a hearing on Friday. Montgomery's bail remains at $125,000 and a preliminary hearing is scheduled for Nov. 19.

"Germany defender Mats Hummels is a doubt for the World Cup final after coming off with a knee problem in the semi final against Brazil . The 25-year-old is undergoing treatment after asking to be taken off at half time in the 7-1 win due to injury. He first hurt his knee in Germany’s 4-0 win over Portugal at the start of the tournament but the big centre back should recover from the problem in time to play in Sunday's final. Big role: Mats Hummels is a key player for Germany, seen here battling with Brazil's Dante . ‘Everyone’s okay except for Mats Hummels and he’s getting further treatment,’ team manager Oliver Bierhoff told German TV, adding the players were given the day off on Wednesday. ‘It’s a precautionary measure. We assume he’ll be able to play in the final.’ Hummels was also spotted walking on the beach on Wednesday with a smile outside his team’s base, although he appeared to be limping slightly. Impact: Hummels helped his side to a first half clean sheet against the Brazilians before being subbed off . Germany team spokesman Jens Grittner said Hummels, 25, was suffering from tendonitis in the knee. ‘We’ll have to see what happens and take it one day at a time,’ said Grittner. Hummels, who scored Germany’s match winner in a 1-0 victory over France in the quarter final and a goal in the win over Portugal, told reporters in Belo Horizonte that he had felt pain in the knee in warm-ups and that it got worse in the first half. Competitor: Brazil striker Fred can't find a way past the Borussia Dortmund man in this duel . ‘I’ve had problems with it for a few days,’ Hummels said. ‘But for the first time it didn’t go away after warm-ups. In the match it got worse and worse.’ He said he asked to come off at half time when Germany were leading 5-0 en route to a 7-1 win. ‘I made the decision that it’s perhaps better to take myself out so that I wouldn’t break anything,’ he said. ‘We’ll have to see exactly what it is. It’s not something tiny but fortunately I don’t think it’s anything that would endanger Sunday.’ Hummels added: ‘I hope that we can take care of it by Sunday. It would be really stupid to miss the final.’ Hard worker: Hummels slides in on Fred here, and has been a key man in Germany's strong defence . Threat up front: Hummels scored the only goal of the game and Germany's winner against France .

"A van driver has died after his vehicle flipped onto its roof, leaving him crushed underneath, following a crash with a marked police car. The 29-year-old man, who has not yet been named, suffered fatal injuries after his Mercedes Sprinter 'pirouetted' 10ft through the air after striking the police car in Coseley, near Dudley, West Midlands. Six people, including the police driver, tried to lift the 2.5 tonne vehicle off the injured man, who had been delivering sandwiches for a catering company at the time of the crash. The 29-year-man, who has not yet been named, suffered fatal injuries after his Mercedes Sprinter van flipped onto its roof and crushed him after colliding with a marked police car in Coseley, near Dudley, West Midlands . Six people, including a police officer, tried to lift the 2.5 tonne vehicle off the casualty following the crash and desperate attempts were made to resuscitate him at the scene but he was pronounced dead a short time later . However, he suffered catastrophic injuries and was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene a short time later. West Midlands Police said the marked patrol car was not responding to an emergency call at the time of yesterday's crash and confirmed the police driver, who was carrying out routine inquiries, was uninjured. Inspector Paul Bennett, from West Midlands Police's regional collision investigation unit, said: 'The man's family has been informed of the collision and will be supported by liaison officers at this difficult time. 'We have launched a full investigation and urge any witnesses to contact us as soon as possible. 'The police officer, who was driving a marked car, was carrying out routine inquiries and was not responding to an emergency incident. He was uninjured but shaken.' Witness Steve Leary, 44, said he and others battled in vain to save the man's life after the van landed on top of him. He said they managed to free the casualty before the police officer tried resuscitation attempts until paramedics reached the scene and took over. He said: 'I had just reversed my car off the driveway to park it in the road. 'I had taken a couple of strides back to the house when I heard a tremendous bang and looked round to see the van pirouette through the air. 'The police officer got out of his car and went to the aid of the other motorist. The driver was delivering sandwiches for a West Bromwich catering company at the time of the fatal crash . West Midlands Police said the marked car was on routine patrol but was not responding to an emergency call . 'I rushed to help him along with a couple of lads who were working on a scaffolding job. 'The van had ended up on its roof a few yards into Martin Close and we were all looking inside for the driver but could not see him. 'By this time other people had arrived to help and six of us lifted the van off him.' Neighbour Deirdre Wood, 58, a former Wolverhampton City Council worker, added: 'The paramedics worked tirelessly to give the man CPR for around 25 minutes. 'It is horrific, we're all in shock and thinking about that poor man's family. 'The emergency services worked so hard but there was nothing that could be done. 'It is absolutely horrendous, we are all traumatised by what has happened.' The driver, who has not yet been named, had only just started working for family-run catering company 'Munchies', which delivers sandwiches to local businesses in West Bromwich, West Midlands. Company director Bal Singh said: 'We are all devastated. He had only been in the job for just over a month - he kept badgering me for a job for ages. 'Eventually a vacancy came up for a delivery driver and we gave him a go, he loved it and said it was the best job in the world. 'He just loved driving and he was killed doing what he enjoyed and just doing his job, going about his day-to-day business. 'He was more of a friend than a colleague and his family are heartbroken, as are we.' The road in Coseley, West Midlands, was closed for about five hours while police investigations took place . The collision occurred at the junction of Central Drive, Bridge Street and Martin Close in Coseley (pictured) West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed it sent an ambulance, a paramedic officer, a rapid response car and the air ambulance to the scene. A spokesman added: 'Crews attended to a collision between two vehicles, one a marked police car. 'Sadly, it quickly became apparent to crews that nothing could be done to save a man involved in the incident. 'He was confirmed dead at the scene. 'The driver of the police vehicle involved was assessed by ambulance staff but did not require hospital treatment.' The road was closed for about five hours while emergency services worked at the scene and carried out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the collision.

"John Grisham has apologized for saying  that many men imprisoned for child pornography offenses in the U.S. probably just had too much to drink and 'pushed the wrong buttons.' Grisham said in a recent interview that U.S. prisons were 'filled with guys my age. Sixty-year-old white men in prison who have never harmed anybody, would never touch a child.' 'Anyone who harms a child for profit or pleasure, or who in any way participates in child pornography—online or otherwise—should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,' he said in a statement today. Scroll down for video . Sorry: Author John Grisham (above) released a statement today apologizing for comments he made about men who watch child porn being punished too harshly. He then added, 'My comments made two days ago during an interview with the British newspaper The Telegraph were in no way intended to show sympathy for those convicted of sex crimes, especially the sexual molestation of children. I can think of nothing more despicable. I regret having made these comments, and apologize to all.' In his interview, which was with The Telegraph, he stated that many of those jailed on charges of child porn did not do anything wrong. 'We've got prisons now filled with guys my age, 60-year-old white men, in prison, who have never harmed anyone,' he said. 'Who would never touch a child, but they got online one night, started surfing around, probably had too much to drink whatever and pushed the wrong buttons, and went too far and went into child porn or whatever.' Grisham made a distinction between 'real pedophiles' and those he said were being punished too harshly. He said offenders did deserve punishment, but 'we've gone nuts with this incarceration.' He also revealed he has a friend serving time in prison for watching child porn in Canada. Bad press: Grisham (left) made the comments while out promoting his new book, Gray Mountain (right) These comments caused public outrage among many, some of whom took to Twitter to attack the author. Child welfare advocates also criticized the comments, which were made during an interview to promote Grisham's latest legal thriller, Gray Mountain. Jon Brown of the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children told the BBC that 'every image is a real child who has suffered and every time these images are clicked on or downloaded it creates demand that ultimately fuels more child abuse.'","John Grisham has apologized after saying in an interview that watching child porn doesn't make one a pedophile .

"A gaffe-prone crime tsar dubbed the 'David Brent of law enforcement' is being investigated by an independent watchdog over whether she was uninsured during a road smash. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has taken over the probe into Kent police commissioner Ann Barnes - who was initially being investigated by her own force. The £85,000-a-year crime chief, who appeared in a widely-derided Channel 4 documentary about her role earlier this year, crashed her soft-top Mercedes into another car before hitting a tree in Dartford, Kent. Scroll down for video . Crime tsar: Kent police commissioner Ann Barnes, pictured with her 'battle bus' Ann Force One, is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over whether she drove without insurance . The Mail on Sunday previously revealed she was being investigated by her own force over the crash, which happened on September 16. Today the Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed Mrs Barnes' office had referred the investigation to it two weeks ago. If Mrs Barnes was found guilty of a charge of driving without insurance, she could be fined £300 and hit with six penalty points on her licence. A statement by the watchdog said: 'Details of the accident in Princes Road, Dartford, on 16 September, were referred to the IPCC by the office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent on 26 September. 'Following an assessment it has been decided that an independent IPCC investigation is necessary to determine whether Ann Barnes may have committed a criminal offence. Ann Barnes' insurance was allegedly expired when her soft-top Mercedes collided with another car and a tree . 'The investigation will be overseen by IPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts.' An IPCC spokesman told MailOnline it had taken over the probe because Mrs Barnes could not be investigated by her own police force. He said: 'Any potential criminal matters involving PCCs or their deputies have to be referred to the IPCC, and in most circumstances we investigate'. He could not give an indication of how long the investigation would take. Police forces often bring prosecutions for driving without insurance after making a check on a national database which takes only a few minutes to complete. A spokesman for Mrs Barnes said neither she nor her office would be making any comment. She added: 'It's an IPCC investigation.' The crash happened on the outskirts of Dartford while Mrs Barnes was driving to a meeting. Controversy: Mrs Barnes also came under fire for hiring Paris Brown as her youth crime commissioner shortly after being elected for the job. The 17-year-old stepped down after posting offensive remarks on Twitter . On what her 'Crime Onion' meant: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion (the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - everything's important.' On her job: 'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner. 'It's a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no actual job description.' On her Ann Force One battle bus: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's not my image.' She suffered minor injuries and tweeted: 'Hit an unforgiving tree! Shaken, sore and bruised, but thankfully OK.’ Mrs Barnes, who travels around in a 'battle bus' dubbed Ann Force One, has faced a string of controversies since she was elected to her post as a political independent in 2012. She came under fire after she appointed Paris Brown, then aged 17, as Britain's first youth crime commissioner. Miss Brown later resigned from the £15,000-a-year job after making offensive comments on her Twitter feed which were revealed by The Mail on Sunday. The former teacher then apologised this summer after taking part in a Channel 4 fly-on-the-wall documentary which rank-and-file officers said had made her a 'laughing stock'. In Meet the Commissioner - which led Twitter users to compare her to the gaffe-prone comedy characters David Brent and Alan Partridge - she struggled to explain what her role involved, failed to write her title correctly on a whiteboard and was filmed painting her 'flaky' nails. She also said in the hour-long programme that driving a Mercedes was not her 'image' - and she was then filmed in the next shot arriving at work in a Mercedes. Pressure on Mrs Barnes later intensified when it emerged her second youth crime tsar, Kerry Boyd, faced allegations of a relationship with a married former councillor. High-profile: Mrs Barnes has faced criticism of her £85,000-a-year role as Kent police commissioner . Former London 2012 torchbearer Miss Boyd, 20, replaced Miss Brown - but stepped away from making public engagements when reports of the relationship surfaced. The former councillor involved later said the pair had been 'good friends'. A former head of the Kent Police Authority, Mrs Barnes won a landslide 47 per cent of the vote in the 2012, smashing second-placed Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay who won 25 per cent. But the turnout was just 16 per cent, a figure echoed across Britain. The low numbers and subsequent gaffes have led critics to accuse the policy of police commissioners, which aimed to hold forces better to account, of being a white elephant.","Kent PCC Ann Barnes crashed into another car then hit tree in Dartford .

It has called the outbreak the 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times'. West Africa is the worst affected area. In Liberia more than 2,300 people have died, while in Sierra Leone and Guinea stands at nearly 1,000 each. Health officials in Europe, the United States and elsewhere are rushing screening measures into at entry points from affected countries to try to stop the spread of the deadly virus. One man had died in the United States from Ebola. The death in Germany comes as Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs it is 'likely' Ebola will reach the UK and that a 'handful' of cases could be confirmed in the next three months. The infected patient is helped as he walks in between two ambulances after arriving on a German Air Force plane from western Africa . The patient had been working in Liberia, the West African country hardest hit by the Ebola crisis .","The 56-year-old man arrived in the country five days ago from Liberia .

"David Cameron is to unveil plans for a cap on the number of European migrants joining Britain's workforce every year as part of negotiations with Brussels, it has emerged. The Prime Minister is expected to announce his 'red line' plans for immigration in a speech designed to win back voters from Ukip as pressure mounts on the Government to reconsider Britain's position in the EU. As part of the measures, a cap would be placed on the number of National Insurance numbers given out to foreigners coming to work in the UK. Scroll down for video . David Cameron is expected to announce plans for a cap on immigration in speeches designed to set out the Conservatives' 'red line' rules on EU membership . Any that are given out will be monitored and given a time limit, the Sunday Times reports. The plans will form part of the Government's negotiation strategy for Britain's future in the EU ahead of a 2017 referendum, sources said. The cap will ensure no more than 100,000 new migrant workers join the UK a year. However critics have claimed withdrawing National Insurance numbers will not push migrants out of the UK's workforce, but merely steer them towards the black market. A senior Whitehall source told the newspaper: 'The latest thinking in No 10 is that you would have an annual cap on the national insurance numbers issued to long-term low-skilled European migrants. 'There would be a quota system to have time-limited national insurance numbers. The prime minister is now in the place where he wants to reduce the numbers coming in, not just the pull factors.' Pressure is mounting on the Government to put forward plans for Britain's future in the EU as support for Ukip, led by Nigel Farage (pictured) grows . Pressure has mounted on the Government to promise an 'in-out' vote on whether voters wish to remain part of the union, with Ukip leader Nigel Farage urging the Cabinet to commit to hearing voters' views on the subject. Earlier this week the Prime Minister said he felt it was worth giving relations with Brussels 'one last go' ahead of the crucial Rochester and Strood by-election, where Tory contenders are fighting Ukip defector Mark Reckless for the seat.","Prime Minister to put plans forward as part of new deal with the EU .

"Sky diving is not for the faint of heart and neither is this footage of a student skydiver who almost falls to his death during a sky diving lesson gone very, very wrong. Yahoo Canada reports that a student skydiver named Eugene S. ended up in a dangerous position mid-air and his instructors frantically managed to re-position him to safety.

Free falling: At first Eugene seems to be sailing smoothly, that is until he spirals out of control and almost falls to his death because he's unable to release his parachute . The video shows two instructors and one student jump out of an airplane. The instructors are seen holding the student in the air by either side to make sure that he doesn't spiral out of control. Unfortunately for the student, gravity is a force to be reckoned with and despite being thrown into the correct position, what goes up sometimes goes upside down. The instructors weave from side to side do their best to get below the student who is spinning repeatedly. One instructor finally manages to grab onto the student, stop him from spinning, and help him release his parachute. All three sky divers land safely from a flight they'll never, ever forget. Reverse is the curse: Eugene spins and begins falling on his back, a position from which he cannot release his parachute to ensure a safe landing . Heroic endeavor: From far away, the instructor can be seen bringing Eugene to safe position for falling so that he may release his parachute and land safely .

"Two New York City cops are facing criminal charges after they were caught in disturbing footage punching and pistol-whipping a teenage suspect who had already raised his hands to surrender. In the video obtained by DNAinfo New York, 16-year-old Kahreem Tribble is seen running away from the officers in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant about 2am on Aug. 29. After a brief chase, Tribble stops running and turns around to face the NYPD cops in apparent surrender. That's when one of the officers, later identified as Tyrane Isaac, approaches the teen and punches him in the head, according to DNAinfo New York. A few seconds later, Officer David Afanador catches up to Tribble — as he raises his hands  — and whacks him in the teeth with the pistol, breaking a front tooth and chipping another, according to the news site. Officer Isaac then later punches the teen again, the website reported. Afanador, who leaves momentarily to find the black bag that Tribble allegedly threw out when he saw the cops, comes back a few minutes later. He waves the bag in the teen's face and smacks him with it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Officer Tyrane Isaac is seen here punching Kahreem Tribble, 16, just seconds after he stops and surrenders . Officer David Afanador catches up to Tribble and is seen pistol-whipping the teen in the mouth . The two cops began chasing Tribble near 1311 St. John's Place when they spotted the 16-year-old looking through the window of a parked vehicle, according to DNAinfo New York. Police say Tribble tossed out a small black bag before taking off and officers feared he had a gun, the news website reported. Tribble was arrested with 17 small bags of marijuana, court records show. He was also charged with disorderly conduct. Officers Isaac and Afanador, both nine-year veterans at Brooklyn's crime-ridden 79th Precinct, are now being investigated by NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau and Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson. A Brookyln grand jury is expected to begin hearing the case next week, the New York Daily News reported. 'What’s depicted on this video is troubling and warrants a thorough investigation,' Thompson told DNAinfo New York. Police Commissioner William Bratton was 'angered and embarrassed' by the incident, a source told the news site. 'Clearly, Commissioner Bratton has seen the video and reacted very aggressively in the sense of saying there have to be consequences when anything is done the wrong way,' Mayor Bill de Blasio said in reaction to the incident. 'I see these videos as another piece of information that we need to use to improve the relationship between police and community and in many cases to heal the relationship between police and community.' Isaac has been placed on modified duty pending the result of the investigation. He's lost his gun and badge. Afanador was suspended without pay. Both officers have two prior legal cases against them alleging brutality and false arrests, court records show. A third officer, Christopher Mastoros, may also be disciplined for failing to do anything as his colleagues allegedly beat the teenager.","Kahreem Tribble, 16, was running away from officers in Brooklyn when they caught up to him, punching and shattering his front teeth .

"The Malaysian chairman of Laura Ashley is facing a huge divorce payout after his estranged wife won the right to have the case heard in English courts. Pauline Chai, 67, a former beauty queen, is expected to demand that Khoo Kay Peng hand over half of his riches after their 43-year marriage fell apart last year. If that happens, it could become one of Britain's largest ever divorce payments. Boris Berezovsky is thought to have paid the most, after reportedly handing £220million to  Galina Besharova in 2011. During her case, Ms Chai claimed her husband made her feel like a prisoner on their 1,000-acre country estate, Rosway Park, only allowed her £100 per week for food. In an attempt to prove Britain is her permanent home, Miss Chai told the court she has 1,000 pairs of shoes in her sprawling £30million Hertfordshire mansion. Pauline Chai, 67, is expected to demand half of her husband's estimated £440million fortune after she today won the right to have her divorce proceedings thrashed out in UK courts . She also told the judge that her husband is worth around £440million, though Dr Peng's lawyers dispute this, saying they do not know the value of his assets. In his ruling today, Mr Justice Bodey said he struggled to believe Ms Chai's statement about her footwear collection, but noted that she spent 54 per cent of her time in this country last year. Though he found in Ms Chai's favour, he urged the couple to come to an out-of-court settlement, saying the pair had so much money they would be ‘hard pressed to spend it all in their lifetimes’. Dr Peng had been pushing to have the divorce heard in Malaysia, where his wife would be entitled to far less of his wealth. He accused Ms Chai of ‘passport juggling’ and being a ‘forum shopper’ - planning to leave England as soon as the divorce is concluded. Dr Peng has already spent nearly three quarters of a million fighting the case, and said he may still proceed with a case in Malaysia - a move described by Mr Justice Bodey as ‘a nightmare’. The judge said he could not be sure of the extent of Dr Peng’s wealth, since he had ‘declined at this stage’ to reveal his assets. He went on to comment that although Malaysia could be an appropriate country for the divorce, ‘England may also be appropriate’. ‘There are many features linking the case to this jurisdiction, just as there are many linking it to Malaysia’, the judge said. He said Rosway Park was ‘a home’ for the family but only ‘one of their homes’. He agreed that the property is not a commercial venture, ‘as the husband has sought to make out’. In his lengthy judgment, Mr Justice Bodey went on to calculate that Miss Chai had spent twice as much time in England compared with Malaysia in recent years. This, he concluded, was a ‘fair amount’ and was enough to establish Ms Chai’s residence. ‘I am satisfied as I can be in an uncertain world that the wife does intend to remain here with a regular immigration status, as soon as she has the necessary funding, which I am told is £1million, to achieve this. Of Ms Chai’s shoes, he said, ‘I have asked myself whether the wife was lying when she spoke of 1,000 pairs of shoes. It is an awful lot of shoes and would take up an awful lot of space’. The judge did not accuse her of making up the figure, but said there must be ‘an element of hyperbole’ in it. Khoo Kay Peng (left) and former Miss Malaysia Pauline Chai were married for 43 years until the union fell apart last year. If Miss Chai succeeds in her court claim, it will be one of Britain's biggest divorce payouts . But he added Dr Peng had been ‘evasive’ and ‘less than helpful’ when appeared on video-link from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. ‘I have carefully reflected on the wife’s own evidence and her demeanour and I reminded myself that her words to me and her words to other are inevitably self-serving.’ But he concluded, ‘In the end, I have concluded on the balance of probabilities that the wife has made out her case.’ Dr Peng has previously said press reports of his wealth were ‘totally false’ and put about by his estranged wife. He asked: ‘One thousand pairs of shoes? How are you going to wear 1,000 pairs of shoes? I don’t know what she buys, because she loves shopping. ‘She shops all over the place. The last time I read of 1,000 pairs of shoes... do you remember Imelda Marcos?’ Mr Justice Bodey ruled that England is the appropriate jurisdiction for in the upcoming divorce. He also rejected Dr Peng’s application for a stay in the English proceedings. Costs will be finalised at a later date. Dr Peng’s barrister has asked for permission to appeal. After the ruling, Pauline Chai stated: 'I wish to thank the Judge, Mr Justice Bodey, for his astute and meticulously detailed findings. 'I also wish to thank my excellent legal team, Messrs Vardags, Richard Todd QC, Nicholas Yates and Tom Harvey of counsel. I hold the English justice system in the highest regard and greatest esteem. 'I have always had a great love of all things English. I am proud to be associated with the exquisite British brand Laura Ashley. 'I am proud to be one of the beneficiaries of one of the greatest gifts that the English have given to the world; the Rule of Law. 'This case confirms that English justice is not only alive but thriving. The people of England are unknowingly very fortunate indeed to have a legal system which is so utterly sound. 'I am pleased the Judge recognised my connection with this great country. I am so pleased that that I, my children and my shoes have found a home here.' Dr Khoo, chairman of Malaysian United Industries, has properties in England, Kuala Lumpur and Australia. He has a 40 per cent stake in Laura Ashley,  and is director of Corus Hotels Limited which owns ten hotels including the grand Corus Hyde Park Hotel. The couple, who married in 1970 and have five grown-up children, and bought their estate in Hertfordshire in 1998 which is said to include a menagerie of animals and two custom-built lakes costing £60,000 each. Ayesha Vardag, Solicitor for Pauline Chai, said : 'Mr Justice Bodey has made a very just decision. 'Pauline Chai trusted in the laws of England, where she made a real and long-term home for herself and her children, and they did not fail her.'","Khoo Kay Peng and Pauline Chai splitting after 43-year marriage fell apart .

"This is the adorable moment a father caught his one-year-old twin girls playing a game of peekaboo after they had been put to bed. Molly and Megan Keher were supposed to be sleeping when their father, Andy, heard his baby daughter's giggling from the hallway of their Liverpool home. Armed with his mobile phone, Mr Keher, 31, crept down the corridor to see what had captured the imaginations of his little girls and watched as they played peekaboo in their cots for almost a minute and a half before he was spotted by Molly.

"Selma the police dog is on a mission to crack computer crime in the state of Connecticut. The Labrador has been trained to pick up the scent for devices such as laptops, digital cameras and USB drives which are often used to stash illegal materials. Despite flunking out of New York City's Guiding Eyes for the Blind program, Selma has found a new vocation sniffing out the chemical associated with electronic-storage devices. Selma the Labrador is a Connecticut police dog who has been trained to sniff out electronic-storage devices . The pooch's work is particularly important in uncovering child pornography, which the FBI says is growing fast, Bloomberg reports. The agency estimates that some 750,000 predators are online at any given moment with victims often found in chatrooms and on social networks. Forensics-science veteran Jack Hubball, who helped police trained the first dog in the world to sniff out arson in 1986, took on the task of identifying the chemicals found in the electronics. He took circuit boards, hard disks and flash drives from computers and tested each component. The expert, who has also helped police train dogs to detect narcotics and bombs, narrowed the analysis down to a single common chemical. The dog is helping police to crack down on computer crime by sniffing out electronics (file picture) Along with her canine pal - a golden Labrador named Thoreau - Selma was trained to detect the odor of the chemical on people's hands, concrete blocks, metal boxes and clothing. The dogs also had to learn to ignore distracting smells such as food and coffee, which can prove almost irresistible to the breed. 'Selma has found many devices such as digital cameras with flash cards, USB drives and external drives,' says said Selma's handler Detective George Jupin of the Connecticut State Police's Computer Crimes Unit. 'The evidence she finds has furthered investigations.' Since going on her first assignment in October 2013, Selma has been involved in more than 50 search warrants with local and state police, as well as the FBI. In one search, the clever pup discovered a memory card buried in a drawer inside a sewing machine. Material on the card led investigators to establish links between a suspect and the victims. Selma has also used her sniffing skills to uncover fraudulent documents and the dog has even assisted on a homicide where the suspect used software to find information on firearms. Another training class for five more dogs will probably be held soon because many agencies have expressed interest. In the meantime Jack Hubball has branched out onto a new challenge in uncovering illegal material stashed on electronics. He is now working on identifying the unique compound in liquid crystal displays, which would be used to by dogs to sniff out the LCD screens on hidden smartphones.","Labrador has been trained to sniff out chemical found in electronic devices .

"A Thai airport has been brought to a temporary standstill after one of its jets skidded off the runway as it prepared to take off. The Thai Airways plane was scheduled to depart the country’s Khon Kaen airport for Bangkok at 8pm on Monday. The crew were attempting a U-turn on the runway when the aircraft left the tarmac, causing its nose wheel to plough into the soft ground. Scroll down for video . The crew of a Thai Airways plane were attempting a U-turn on the runway at Khon Kaen airport when the aircraft left the tarmac, causing its nose wheel to plough into the soft ground . None of the 248 passengers or 14 crew onboard suffered any injuries, and were taken off the aircraft via air stairs. Khon Kaen’s single runway has no taxiways. This requires departing aircraft to taxi to the runway’s end before turning around ahead of take-off. The incident brought an immediate halt to the airport’s operations while recovery crews at Khon Kaen airport began digging out the Airbus A330-300 this morning. Officials from Thai Airways, Air Asia, and Nok Air are escorted passengers who planned to depart from Khon Kaen airport to buses to board their flights at Udon Thani Airport instead. It is expected that operations at Khon Kaen airport will resume later today. The incident is the latest to have affected Thai Airways, which is battling fincancial losses said to have been caused by a drop in tourism to Thailand in recent years . The incident is the latest to have affected Thai Airways, which is said to have suffered from a drop in tourism to Thailand in recent years. The company reported a net loss of THB7.7 billion (£150,000) in the second quarter of this year – a decline which has been blamed on a lack of confidence in Thailand as a tourist destination because of political unrest. The airline recently cancelled flights to its only remaining Africa destination, Johannesburg. The airline will now stop its three weekly flights to the city from January 2015. Thai Airways president Siwakiat Jayema has called for wide-ranging cuts to be made at the airline and suggested that more than 6,000 jobs at the flag carrier could be go over the next four years. Thailand’s much prized tourist industry is in decay following more than 12 months of political unrest, a subsequent military coup and the murder of two British backpackers in mid-September . Siwakiat is the third president that Thai Airways has seen in a little over six months. He took over from temporary president Chokchai Panyayong in July, who replaced previous incumbent Sorajak Kasemsuvan in January following the latter’s resignation in December last year. Thailand’s much prized tourist industry is in decay following more than 12 months of political unrest, which included military coup as well as the murder of two British backpackers in mid-September. In the first nine months of 2014, there were more than two million fewer foreign tourists who visited Thailand compared with the same period a year previously. From an initial forecast at the end of last year of 30.27 million foreign visitor arrivals Thailand’s Ministry of Tourism and Sports is now forecasting 25.5 million foreign visitors in 2015.","Thai Airways flight was preparing to depart Khon Kaen airport on Monday .

"Police are still struggling to find a single lead on the murder of a 15-year-old girl two months after she was found strangled and burned. Dominique Allen was last seen sitting on her sister's porch in Indianapolis at 4.30am on August 31. Her burned body was discovered at 12.30pm the same day in the yard of a home three minutes' drive away on a busy street. Detectives have since scoured the area and found her DNA in an abandoned property across the street from where she was buried, while an autopsy confirmed she was strangled then burned. But despite the detailed forensic evidence from the scene which has round-the-clock traffic, they have not found a single witness and cannot pin their suspicions on anyone, simply saying it was 'an unknown random attacker'. Mystery: Dominique Allen, 15, (left) went missing on August 31 and despite detailed forensic evidence from the crime scene on a busy Indianapolis street, detectives have found nothing, leaving her family (right) distraught . 'We're jeopardizing the community by keeping this person out there,'  one of Dominique's sisters, Shenika Poindexter, told the Indy Star. 'Somebody knows something.' The investigation team believes Dominique - who was visiting the neighborhood - went on to the porch to cool off after an argument with friends. A car is then thought to have pulled up outside the property, abducted the 15-year-old and taken her to the now-abandoned house three minutes away. She was strangled to death and then taken across the street where her body was partially burned and buried, officers say. They have no idea how many people were involved and cannot understand why there are no witnesses that saw Dominique near the home where she was killed. Police normally patrolling the street had been called to a shooting at a nearby strip club at around 4:30am. However, detectives insist it is strange that the killer managed to take Dominique into the house and then carry her body and personal effects across the busy street without anyone seeing. Detective Marcus Kennedy, who is leading the investigation for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, said: 'There were lots of chances there.' According to Dominique's sisters, she was shy and did not approach strangers. After her mother died of Crohn's disease in 2012, shortly before two of her best friends were killed in a street fight, Dominique became quiet, they said. Call for action: Her sisters have blasted the stagnant case for 'jeopardizing the community' 'I don't know why you had to do this. Whatever you do, wherever you go, justice is going to be served, in this life or the next,' Poindexter raged in an emotional attack on Dominique's murderer. 'I don't care, they will hunt you until you die. ... She did not deserve this, she did not deserve this, she was 15 years old.' In August, Detective Kennedy said: 'At this time, we believe it was random' and described how his team was combing registered sex offenders for possible leads and checking for reported runaways in case there are other victims. However, the outlook has not changed in two months. Kennedy distributed a photograph of Dominique taken the last night she was alive. In it, she's smiling and wearing the sandals that were later discovered. Her sisters said Dominique, who attended Ben Davis Ninth Grade Center, wanted to be a model and to attend Spelman College in Atlanta. Deputy Mayor Olgen Williams, who lives a few blocks away from where the girl's body was found, comforted the family at the news conference. 'Pretty young lady, she had a future, and this evil person, or persons, destroyed her life,' he said.","Dominique Allen, 15, was taken from her sister's porch at 4.30am August 31 .

"A grandmother who bought a crumbling 17th Century house for just £300 in 1968 has finally put it on the market after spending 46 years painstakingly restoring it back to its former glory. Gillian Holland, 71, bought the abandoned black-and-white timber-framed home in Bewdley, Worcester, at a knockdown price after discovering it was about to be demolished. She and her late husband Terry spent almost half a century lovingly restoring Bridge View - which was built in 1623 - and she has now finally put it on the market with an asking price of £200,000. Gillian Holland, 71, bought the abandoned black-and-white timber-framed home in Bewdley, Worcester, for just £300 in 1968 after discovering it was about to be demolished. She has spent the last 46 years restoring it . Ms Holland pictured at the property in the early 1970s, towards the start of the lengthy renovation process . Ms Holland (pictured today) said she has spent £20,000 transforming the property, which she will now sell . Despite spending most weekends and holidays scouring skips and breakers yards for beams and fixtures to use in the house, she has never spent a night in the property. Ms Holland, a retired library clerk, lived in a house three doors down from the ruined house, and now hopes it will be bought by a family. She has spent an estimated £20,000 doing the work and finally completed it earlier this summer. The grandmother-of-three said: 'No-one wanted the property as it was about to have a demolition order slapped on it by the Bewdley borough surveyors. It was in a really bad state. 'We live very close by and we just fell in love with the house. 'We didn't want it to be knocked down so just went for it when we realised no-one else was going to step in and buy it. 'It was lethal. We bought it purely out of self-interest. Nobody else would have been stupid enough to buy it. 'We took the building to the ground ourselves. It was daunting because we did not have a lot of money. The house, named Bridge View, was built in 1623 and had been set for demolition when bought by Ms Holland . She has scoured scrap yards and timber sites to find the specific beams and interior to refurbish the property . Despite spending decades restoring the house, Ms Holland has never spent a night in the property and instead lives in a house on the same road. She said she took on the project with her late husband out of 'self-interest' 'We had no idea how much property restoration cost - it must be around £20,000. 'We put scaffolding up ourselves and over the pavement, which would not be allowed today. 'We took it down and marked up all the timbers and detailed where they had come from. 'In 1967, the Civic Amenities Act was introduced and this awarded town scheme grants. This was crucial for us. 'Bewdley was the first conservation town in Worcestershire, and Bridge View was the first property awarded a grant of about £3,000. 'That gave us hope. The county conservation team were very supportive. We were in the position then to employ a knowledgeable student architect.' The couple, who had three children, split up in the early 1990s and Mr Holland died in his sixties several years ago - but she continued to restore the building. She added: 'We kept running out of money and we were poor most of our lives. 'We had lots of help from skilled local craftsmen. For instance, we learned how to lay the traditional local tiles. 'Most modern tiles are nailed on, but if you drill old tiles they split and are lain on traditional lime mortar. 'We even went through skips. We found timbers, pieces of sandstone, Jacobean panelling and piles of things we needed. 'It is a bit of a wrench to sell it, considering I have never even spent one night in the property but I'm immensely proud of what we did. Ms Holland said: 'We bought it purely out of self-interest. Nobody else would have been stupid enough to buy it' The property was completed earlier this summer and has been put on the market this week for £200,000 . Ms Holland said she hopes a family will buy the property and said restoring it has been a 'remarkable journey' The house was originally a general store selling pewter, iron supplies and food to people living in Bewdley . 'The two estate agents who have looked at the property have both valued it at about £200,000 but said it was difficult to value. 'They noted that is in the flood plain and is vulnerable to flooding, there is no garden and it is on the main road. It is not madly attractive. 'But I have got to sell it now. All my savings are tied up in it. I probably need to go to a care home soon so I need to move out. I cannot care for the building anymore. 'Having spent most of my life rebuilding it, I am not going to just sell it to someone who thinks it is quaint. 'I am not walking around saying ""I am proud of this and that"". It was just really interesting to do. 'It enabled me to do, in that day in the 1960s, a lot of things women were unable to do. It has been an education. 'It was fun. It is like some people spend time on rebuilding classic cars. Money was not relevant, it was a remarkable journey.' The house was originally a general store selling pewter, iron supplies and food to people crossing the medieval bridge into Bewdley. It was then turned into a pub before finally being converted into a private house when it fell into a state of disrepair at the beginning of the 20th century. Ms Holland (centre right), pictured in the early 1970s with joiner Tom Piper (left), architect Michael Peach (centre left), and her late husband Tony Holland (right), who all contributed over the years to the restoration . Ms Holland said: 'I have never even spent one night in the property but I'm immensely proud of what we did' She said estate agents have found it difficult to value the property because it is situated on a flood plain and there is lack of a garden (above). It is also on a main road. The grandmother added: 'It is not madly attractive' Ms Holland said: 'There were lots of reasons why the renovation project took so long to complete but mainly because it was the money. 'We had three children to bring up and jobs to do and we also didn't want to rush into renovating the house. We wanted to take the time to do it right. 'We spent a long time tracking down the exact materials we needed. For example, it took us a long time to track down the correct bullnose bricks for the wall which were unique to Bewdley. 'Before the children were born myself and Terry spent hours driving around Bewdley in a Land Rover scouring scrap yards and building merchants. 'At that time people didn't value historic buildings so usually they would strip out the original features of a house, the tiles and panelling and just dump it all. 'We got quite skilled at finding out where demolitions were taking place and negotiated with the people who were taking the properties apart. 'Because we were doing most of the work ourselves, we got a lot of things wrong. 'On one occasion we bought a large section of sandstone wall for the foundations but didn't realise that turns back to sand when it goes in the ground. 'We both wanted the house to be renovated properly because otherwise there would have been no point doing it in the first place.'","Gillian Holland bought abandoned timber-framed property for £300 in 1968 .

"As we slip into the colder months it’s time to reach into the back of the wardrobe and pull out the warmest, cosiest clothes you can find. Trouble is, you might get a lot more than you bargained for. October is the month for discovering moth infestations according to pest control experts. They’ve lain undisturbed, happily chewing through your best cashmere and had ample time, space and fuel to breed like wild fire, strewing everything with larvae. What’s more, there are more around than ever. Scroll down for video . October is the month for discovering moth infestations according to pest control experts . Paul Bates, managing director of Cleankill pest controllers, has seen at least 10 per cent more call-outs in the last year, and 30 per cent more over the past five years. If left untreated the larvae — it’s the caterpillar-like larvae that eat fabrics, not adult moths — can do hundreds of pounds worth of damage to clothing, carpets and soft furnishings. It’s Moth-ageddon, and you need to be prepared. So, from conkers and smoke bombs to microwaves and pheromone strips — here’s what you need to know to beat them. Paul Bates, managing director of Cleankill pest controllers, has seen at least 10 per cent more call-outs in the last year and 30 per cent more over the past five years . WHY MOTH-AGEDDON NOW? Thanks to the influx of cheap cashmere on the High Street we own far more natural fibres than we used to and, as high quality fabrics are a moth’s favourite meal, they’re thrilled. The increased use of walk-in wardrobes means the moths have far more space to access clothes and remain undetected. The unusually warm summer has also helped to increase the moth population, while our open windows have encouraged them indoors. Paul Bates also blames a decrease in the strength of pesticides. Thanks to the influx of cheap cashmere on the High Street we own far more natural fibres and high quality fabrics are a moth’s favourite meal . ‘Part of the problem has been the withdrawal of some of the most effective insecticides such as dichlorvos, which is now deemed dangerous to health. ‘There used to be almost 400 insecticides available to pest controllers, now there are more like 30.’ To add to this, we heat our homes all year round, fail to clean as rigorously as our grandparents and fly off on cheap package breaks to places such as Turkey and India — bringing back carpets and fabrics infested with moth eggs. HOW CAN YOU PREVENT AN INFESTATION? DEEP CLEAN . The best thing you can do to prevent a moth attack is to put your clothes away when they are clean. Larvae gravitate towards grime as it’s higher in protein-rich nutrients. Jo Poole, a seamstress known as The Dress Doctor, says: ‘Deter them by emptying your wardrobe and washing everything. If something can’t be washed, get it dry-cleaned. Clean out the inside of your wardrobe, too. Take everything out, vacuum and wipe the insides.’ Moths lay most eggs in the carpet so destroy them at the source by moving furniture and vacuuming in all crevices. A moth’s life cycle can be anything from 55 to 90 days so give your home and clothing a thorough clean every month or two — or they’ll come crawling back . A moth’s life cycle can be anything from 55 to 90 days so give your home and clothing a thorough clean every month or two — or they’ll come crawling back. Make sure you empty the vacuum cleaner bag or they’ll hatch there, too. FREEZER . As bonkers as it sounds, this really works. For clothing that can’t be washed, such as leather or fur, put it in the freezer. ‘It doesn’t damage clothing at all,’ says Jo Poole. ‘You need to do it for at least 72 hours to kill all moths and eggs. I put my clothes in individual plastic bags first —you don’t want moth eggs in your food — then take them out and hang them to air dry.’ MICROWAVE . Even more barmy-sounding — and not for the faint hearted — you could try exterminating moths from garments by putting them briefly in the microwave. A study for the American Journal Institute for Conservation found that all moths, larvae and eggs could be killed when 10 per cent wool fabrics were microwaved for three minutes at 2450MHz microwave radiation — the frequency of modern microwave ovens. You could try exterminating moths from garments by putting them briefly in the microwave. The side effects were a tiny amount of shrinkage but no colour change. ‘One of my clients swears by microwaving her cashmere tops to kill larvae but I wouldn’t dare,’ says Jo Poole. ACID-FREE PAPER . Take precautions with your best sheets, outfits or precious fabrics by storing them in plastic vacuum packed sealed bags if you don’t need them in the near future. John Lewis sells a set of two for £10. Or you could go one better and wrap special items in acid-free tissue paper before vacuum packing. ‘Acid-free paper helps prevent clothing getting hard creases which cause weak spots in fabric,’ says Jo Poole. ‘It also protects them from plastic which contains chemicals which can damage fibres.’ For professional vacuum packaging try Terrington Burchett (ukweddingdresscleaners.co.uk) and try Staples for acid-free paper (£5.29, staples.co.uk). CONKERS AND CLOVES . ‘Plants produce harmful chemicals and unappealing smells to stop insects eating them and their seeds,’ says moth expert Dr Norman Lowe of the Brecknock Wildlife Trust in Powys. ‘It’s biochemical warfare.’ Conkers have one of the strongest moth-repelling aromas. ‘As conkers dry out a gas is emitted which works as a mild insecticide, killing moths and larvae,’ says Paul Bates. Conkers must be fresh; so put new ones in your drawers every few weeks. Other less strong but decent repellents include eucalyptus and bay leaves, cinnamon sticks and cloves. LAVENDER . ‘Lavender, thanks to its strong smell, is a very good deterrent,’ says Jo Poole, a seamstress known as The Dress Doctor . The problem is, many of the above leave musky smells. ‘Lavender, thanks to its strong smell, is a very good deterrent,’ says Jo Poole. ‘Ideally, put a bag of lavender on every hanger and a couple in every drawer. If that’s too much hassle, sprinkling lavender into a tray at the bottom of your wardrobe works, too.’ Buy a kilo of lavender for £10 from driedlavendershop.co.uk and refresh old lavender by adding a couple of drops of lavender oil. WHAT TO DO IF IT’S TOO LATE . Mothballs fade quickly and are often too weak to bring down numbers significantly enough to save your favourite jumper . PHEROMONE TRAPS . These catch moths quickly without any pesticide and give useful clues as to how bad your infestation is. Usually these look like a rectangular flat piece of sticky cardboard with tent-like sides. Male moths fly inside then get stuck on the sticky surface. ‘They are really effective; I’ve seen 20 or more caught on one,’ says Dr Lowe. ‘The sticky bit of the trap is impregnated with a female pheromone that attracts male moths only.’ With no males left, females die without laying eggs and you win. (£5.56, Aeroxon at Tesco). SMOKE BOMBS . Sometimes, you need to bring out the big guns. Mothballs fade quickly and are often too weak to bring down numbers significantly. Use a smoke bomb instead. ‘Get one for when you know you will be away for the weekend, as they can be quite potent,’ says Jo Poole. Super Fumer (£5.79 from mothkiller.co.uk) contains the toxic chemical permethrin which destroys all moths quickly. Use it in one room after shutting the door and all windows. The smoke won’t damage furniture or fabrics but you’ll need to air the room out afterwards. EMBELLISH AWAY . Unfortunately moths have great taste. ‘They love natural fabrics which give them more nutrition than synthetic materials because of their high keratin protein content,’ says Paul Bates. ‘Because they are made of very fine fibres, fabrics such as cashmere, angora and silk are also easier for moths to digest,’ adds Dr Lowe. But if the worst happens and you find your jumper holier than a cheese grater, all is not lost. If a moth has munched through a family heirloom, it might be worth sending it to an expert to be invisibly mended . ‘Little holes are easy to fix,’ says Jo Poole. ‘Turn the garment inside out, do a few overstitches to catch the loose threads together then steam or iron it flat again and you’ll barely notice a difference.’ For bigger holes use a patch, darn it or cover it with embellishments. Jo suggests using lace (‘always pretty’), worn denim (‘new denim has no give’) and wide velvet ribbon (‘much stronger than normal ribbon’) for attractive patches — or vintage lace coasters from craft websites such as etsy.co.uk. ‘Be imaginative or use bits from old clothes – just make sure the patch has been washed before attaching it so it doesn’t shrink, making the garment pucker.’ INVISIBLE MENDING . If a moth has munched through a family heirloom, it might be worth sending it to an expert to be invisibly mended. ‘It’s expensive and takes ages but is utterly brilliant if it’s something you care about and don’t want to throw away,’ says Jo Poole. The intricate sewing technique, which takes years to master, involves taking threads from the seam allowances inside the garment and using them to intricately re-weave the patch that’s missing, by hand, to perfectly match the material’s existing stitching. The British Invisible Mending Service has a handful of invisible menders in London and Wales. Prices start at £40 for a small hole.","October is the month for moth infestations according to pest control experts .

"Medics, marines and sailors waved farewell as a Royal Navy ship left for Sierra Leone today, loaded with aid, food, water and equipment to help treat people infected with the deadly Ebola virus in a bid to stop it spreading. Prime Minister David Cameron has called for other countries to do more to tackle the epidemic, which has so far killed more than 4,500 people and has been deemed the 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times' by the World Health Organisation. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Argus, a navy ship, left Falmouth Docks in south west England for the 10-day journey to Sierra Leone - one of the west African countries worst hit by the disease. The ship is carrying equipment to build medical units and life saving medical materials as well as thousands of bottles of water. It is due to stop at Gibraltar en route to collect more supplies to ensure as many people as possible can be treated. Scroll down for video . The ship is carrying equipment to build medical units and life saving medical materials as well as thousands of bottles of water . A total of 380 personnel including medics and marines are on board the ship bound for Sierra Leone to treat patients infected with Ebola . Merlin helicopters will travel with the ship during its 10-day journey to Sierra Leone to support medical teams and aid workers on board . Around 380 personnel - including 80 medics and 80 marines - set sail on the ship today as dozens lined the decks of the ship to wave goodbye to onlookers as it left the dock after waiting for high tide. The ship could be stationed off the west coast of Africa for up to three months and is being termed a 'floating hospital'. It has a casualty unit and 100 beds but no patients will be brought aboard to prevent further transmission of the disease. Instead it will be used as a forward base for medics, engineers, soldiers and aid experts to build specialist medical units. Captain David Eagles said all crew will be subject to strict checks to prevent the spread of Ebola. Any personnel infected with Ebola will be treated on shore and flown to a British treatment clinic in Kerry Town. Earlier today David Cameron said Ebola was 'the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation' as he called for countries to do more to tackle the crisis. The ship is travelling with three Merlin utility helicopters, air crew and engineers to provide transport and support to medical teams and aid workers. The personnel on board include medics who will use their expertise to try and combat the deadly outbreak of Ebola in west Africa . People lined Falmouth docks to bid farewell to the ship and its 380 personnel as it left for Sierra Leone today . Troops with landing craft will escort personnel ashore and protect teams deployed on the ground. Captain David Eagles, 52, of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, said his crew will be subjected to 'tough' regulations while aboard the giant ship to keep it sterile. They will be banned from going ashore throughout the deployment and the Royal Marines who do will face a stringent decontamination process to re-board. The Ebola epidemic has gripped west Africa where the majority of deaths have occurred. In Sierra Leone (above) burial teams abandoned the bodies of victims of the disease when they went on strike earlier this month, as people gather round a suspected victim . Volunteers working in west Africa have been wearing special protective clothing to treat patients in a bid to stop Ebola spreading . Medics will take their temperatures twice a day and anyone who shows signs of Ebola will be flown to a British treatment clinic in Kerry Town. Captain Eagles said: 'The initial anxiety of the ship's company and families has now been replaced by pride in what is a very good mission as a part of the wider UK mission to save lives in Sierra Leone and contribute to the safety of the UK. The ship is part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), part of the Royal Navy . It is classed as naval/naval auxiliary vessel . The ship is 175.1 m (574ft 6ins) long . It has a speed of 18 knots (33 km/h) RFA Argus has a casualty unit and 100 beds . A total of 380 personnel, including 80 medics and 80 marines are on board . 3 Merlin helicopters, air crew and engineers will travel with the ship . Gross tonnage: 26421t . 'The four building blocks to keep our people safe are the education, the training, the supervision and the leadership. 'I am confident that we have those pillars in place.' The WHO said the number of Ebola cases in West Africa could exceed 9,000 this week. Heathrow airport also started screening passengers arriving from the worst hit countries for signs of the disease and more British airports are due to do the same. Speaking at an Asia-Europe summit in Milan, David Cameron said: 'This is the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation. 'I think it's time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what Britain is doing in Sierra Leone, America's doing in Liberia and France is doing in Guinea. 'Other countries now need to step forward with resources and action because taking action at source in west Africa, that is the best way to protect all of us here in Europe.' Britain is taking the international lead role in tackling Ebola in Sierra Leone due to its historic links. Sierra Leone gained independence from Britain in 1961. Three Merlin utility helicopters, air crew and engineers are travelling with RFA Argus as it travels to Sierra Leone to treat Ebola patients . First of three Merlin Mk2 helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron is pictured touching down on the RFA Argus as it sails to Sierra Leone . Captain Eagles said personnel on the ship will be subject to stringent testing before they can re-board to prevent spread of Ebola . Prime Minister David Cameron spoke at the Asia-Europe summit  when he said countries need to do much more to tackle Ebola and help stop the spread of the deadly disease, which has killed more than 4,000 people mostly in west Africa . But Britain's International Development Secretary Justine Greening said other nations needed to pull their weight in the region. 'It is simply not going to be a tenable approach to simply leave the UK to work with Sierra Leone, the US with Liberia and France with Guinea and for no other countries to get involved,' she told BBC radio. 'The international community now needs to wake up to this crisis and start putting resources in.' A British army medical team arrived in Sierra Leone on Thursday to work at a British-supported treatment centre. Also this week Heathrow airport started screening arrivals from the worst-affected region for the deadly disease. This was due to be launched at London Gatwick by the end of this week and will be extended to Manchester and Birmingham airports. The ship has been loaded with materials to build medical units as well as life saving supplies and will stop off at Gibraltar to collect more . Earlier this week Lt Susan Jeffreys checked medical equipment in the ship's on board hospital ahead of its departure for Sierra Leone .

People watched from Falmouth Docks as the ship left for Sierra Leone today (left), after being loaded with supplies this week (right) As the RFA Argus set off for Sierra Leone David Cameron said countries must do more to tackle the Ebola pandemic in west Africa . WHO assistant director-general Dr Bruce Aylward previously said that if the world's response to the Ebola crisis isn't stepped up within 60 days, 'a lot more people will die' and health workers will be stretched even further. Ebola spreads through close contact with a sufferer's bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat, vomit, faeces, urine, saliva or semen. It can be incubated for 21 days and symptoms include a fever, flu-like body aches and abdominal pain, and then vomiting and diarrhoea. William Pooley, 29, is the only British person known so far to be diagnosed with Ebola. Mr Pooley, a nurse, caught the deadly disease while working in a hospital in Sierra Leone. He was flown back to the UK by the RAF and treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London inside a specially designed polythene 'patient isolator' tent, tended by dozens of staff in the tailor made unit. He recovered from the disease and has since said he plans to return to the country to help other patients.

"Anger: Carol says that she was treated 'like a common criminal' When Carol Howard, the former poster girl for the Metropolitan Police, took her employers to an employment tribunal, the verdict was huge embarrassment to the pre-eminent force in the land. The Met was found to have subjected her to an orchestrated campaign of ‘malicious, vindictive and spiteful actions’, which effectively derailed a glittering 13-year career. Just how malicious and vindictive, however, she has only now revealed. Because, in a new legal action, 35-year-old Miss Howard says her employers not only discriminated against her, but accused her of crimes – including possession of an indecent image of a child – she had not committed to silence and discredit her. More shocking still, details of the ‘crimes’ were passed to the media and even to the employment tribunal in an apparent smear campaign, despite the fact that, in at least two cases, the allegations against her had already been quietly dropped. ‘I’m in no doubt at all that these arrests and so-called allegations were a crude attempt to silence me,’ says Carol, a firearms officer attached to the elite Diplomatic Protection Squad, whose image was seen all over London as the face of the Met at the 2012 London Olympics. ‘I have had my reputation besmirched. My personal life was turned inside out, my daughter kept from me and fingers pointed at me as though I was some kind of sexual deviant and unable to do my job properly. ‘I was effectively being punished for daring to think I was as good as the white men I worked with and for speaking up for myself.’ She says she has issued legal proceedings in an attempt to force the Met – which still employs her – to own up to its actions. Carol was arrested on three occasions between August last year and April 2014, leading to a total of eight investigations against her for ‘crimes’ including criminal damage, harassment and perverting the course of justice. In fresh employment tribunal papers, seen by The Mail on Sunday, Ms Howard also accuses the Met of maliciously informing Sussex Social Services about an ‘indecent image’ to spark a child protection investigation that prevented Ms Howard from seeing her six-year-old daughter for four weeks. The information was passed on despite the fact Sussex Police had already decided it was not necessary to refer the matter to social services. In one particularly humiliating instance, five uniformed Met officers arrived at her daughter’s school and marched her away. She is particularly angry that investigations following her arrest on April 22, 2014 were dropped within a matter of weeks, yet she was not informed and was kept on suspension and police bail until the end of July 2014 when the Met finally told her they would be taking no further police action against her. Scroll down for video . The right image: Carol was the Metropolitan Police's Olympics poster girl . Worse still, the Met told both the media and the Tribunal judge about Ms Howard still being on police bail as a result of this arrest as late as July – based on investigations that had already been abandoned. She spent a full 13 months on bail with the threat of legal action that never materialised. Ms Howard has already spoken about the way she was victimised within the Met’s firearms squad, in particular by her Acting Inspector who had attempted to ‘undermine, discredit and belittle’ her. But the breakdown of Carol’s ten-year relationship with the father of her youngest daughter made matters worse. She and her husband separated in 2012. ‘In August last year, not long after our separation, we had a dispute. He was upset and under so much stress he stupidly went to Crawley police station and falsely claimed that I had assaulted him 14 months previously and harassed him,’ she says. She is still astonished, however, at how quickly things spiralled out of control after that. ‘Even if I had scratched him, which I didn’t, it would only have been a minor offence of common assault, but the Police deliberately ramped it up to the more serious allegation of actual bodily harm to justify an arrest.’ Revelations: A Mail on Sunday report on Carol's case from last month . Although Rob called the station seven times without my knowledge to withdraw his allegations, he stated he was being fobbed off. Then on the day prior to my arrest, he went to the station in person to make a withdrawal statement and he was told to ‘go away and to come back later at 6:30pm’ and the same officers attended my home and arrested me at 6:00pm – 30 minutes before he was due to return to the police station. It was a set-up.’ Carol says she was held for four hours in a police cell before being interrogated ‘like a common criminal’. And, although this was Sussex police’s jurisdiction, she was confronted on arrival at the police station by a Met police inspector who had been involved in her tribunal complaints and was later found to have acted unlawfully against her. Carol believed this further supports her claims of both forces working together to close ranks against her. ‘I felt the officers in attendance were enjoying the fact that I was frightened and upset. They didn’t bother to tell me or my solicitor that Rob had withdrawn his statement. Given my clean record they could simply have invited me in for an interview under caution, but it was all done with malice and clearly pre-planned. The Met wanted to have the arrest over me, so they could use it at the forthcoming employment tribunal.’ But when her husband lodged a complaint over their treatment of Carol, he too was arrested by the same police officers for perverting the course of justice and wasting police time. Carol feels he was being punished for standing up for her. To Carol’s astonishment, in January 2014 she, too, was further arrested for perverting the course of justice and witness intimidation (the police claimed she had cajoled her husband into withdrawing his allegations against her.) In May 2014, it is alleged that the Metropolitan Police contacted Sussex Social Services and asked them to carry out a child protection referral into an ‘indecent image’. In her latest employment tribunal application Ms Howard says: ‘There was absolutely no basis on which the innocent picture of my own daughter could be said to be indecent. Even Sussex police had apparently accepted that there was no basis on which to inform child protection or social services about the matter. However, to victimise me and harass me further, the Met had maliciously referred me to Sussex social services and closely liaised with Sussex Police to do so. ‘I did not see my daughter for four weeks. It was awful and heartbreaking. I had to go to my daughter’s sports day and see parents look at me in disgust because they thought I was a paedophile,’ she recalls. ‘It is the worst thing you could say about any woman – especially a mother – and I was unable to defend myself, because of it. It is all connected with my complaints of discrimination against the Met. They appear to victimise officers who complain by arresting them.’ Last month an employment tribunal awarded her £37,000 in aggravated damages for sexual and racial discrimination. But she says it is no compensation for being falsely labelled a ‘child predator’ – or the destruction of her career.","Tribunal found that the Met subjected Carol Howard to 'spiteful' campaign .

"A five-year-old Chinese girl has had to be rescued by firefigghters after she tried to climb out of her 15th floor apartment window, only to get her head stuck in the safety bars. The shocking incident took place earlier this week in Chongqing Municipality in the southwest of the country, when young Li Li was left at home alone while her parents went out to work. With nothing to do and nobody to talk to, the five-year-old attempted to climb out the window, wriggling through the safety bars before getting her head stuck in a twist of fate that almost certainly prevented her falling 15 floors to her death. Terrifying: Five-year-old Li Li had to be rescued by firefighters after she tried to climb out of her 15th floor apartment window, only to get her head stuck in the safety bars. Horror: When neighbours first saw clothing fluttering from the window, they assumed it was just washing left out to dry. It was only on closer inspection that they realized it was a little girl hanging out the window . According to investigators, Li Li attempted to climb out the window but, although her body fit through the safety bars, her head became stuck. As a result the five-year-old was left dangling 15-storeys above the ground. When neighbours first saw clothing fluttering from the window, they assumed Li Li was just washing that had been left out to dry. It was only on closer inspection that they realized it was a little girl, which led to them calling the emergency services. Rescue: Two separate fire crews arrived at the property to free Li Li, with one team knocking down her locked front door, while another made their way to the floor above so they could abseil down to her (pictured) Crowds gathered: The shocking incident took place earlier this week in Chongqing Municipality in the southwest of the country, when young Li Li was left at home alone while her parents went out to work . Safe and sound: Despite her terrifying ordeal, Li Li is expected to make a full recovery. Investigators are expected to look into why such a young child was left at home alone in the middle of the day . Two separate fire crews arrived at the property to rescue Li Li, with one team knocking down her locked front door, while another made their way to the floor above so they could abseil down to her.

Despite her terrifying ordeal, Li Li is expected to make a full recovery. Investigators are expected to look into why such a young child was left at home alone in the middle of the day, although such behaviour it a relatively common occurrence in China, particularly in heavily industrialised areas where both parents are expected to work and childcare costs are high.","Li Li attempted to climb out to window after being left at home alone .

"The problem of finding space to restock the fridge with bottles of beer is over because a revolutionary magnetic device 'hangs' them inside. Named bottleLoft, the gadget suspends bottles of beer from the top of a fridge using magnets. By doing this it frees up empty space in the fridge to gives the user more room to store food, drink and other things. Scroll down for video . Design engineer Brian Conti from North Carolina has created magnetic strips called bottleLoft to hold beer bottles in fridges (shown). They stick to the top of the fridge and hold up to six bottles. The device can be bought for £12 ($20) and is currently on Kickstarter . The unique device, which holds three standard sized bottles of beer, is eight inches (20.3cm) long and 1.5 inches (3.8cm) wide. The team are currently seeking funding on Kickstarter, with each strip of magnets costing about £12 ($20). Beer, or at least one of its ingredients, could boost brain function, a new study has found. But a leisurely pint is unlikely to have any intellectual benefit, because a person would need to drink the equivalent of 3,520 pints (2,000 litres) a day to stand any chance of boosting their cognitive abilities. Researchers at Oregon State University demonstrated that xanthohumol -a type of flavonoid found in hops and beer - improved cognitive function in young mice. Flavonoids are compounds found in plants that often give them their colour and scientists have been studying them in blueberries, dark chocolate and red wine to uncover any potential benefits that could help fight cancer and heart disease, for example. Scientists hope that xanthohumol could be used to treat metabolic syndrome, a condition associated with obesity and high blood pressure, as well as age-related deficits in memory. The rare micronutrient is found in the hops, commonly used to make beer. It uses Neodymium magnets, the strongest type of commercial magnet available, to hold on to the bottle caps and the whole device attaches to the 'ceiling' of a fridge using special 3M tape. Design engineer Brian Conti, from Charlotte, North Carolina, US, came up with the idea. The 46-year-old said: 'The idea came through observing a problem - specifically what to do about my crowded fridge. 'The introduction of a six-pack or 12-pack of bottled beverages into my fridge usually creates space havoc. 'After some thought, it was obvious that there was a lot of unused space at the top of my refrigerator. 'I have many of my magnets on the side of my fridge in my kitchen. 'One day after opening a bottle, the cap fell to the floor under a cabinet. 'I grabbed a magnet to retrieve the cap and the idea popped into my head. This lead to experimenting then prototyping - and bottleLoft was born. 'I had experience with using magnets from my previous projects and the idea of magnetically 'hanging' bottles up out of the way was formed.' Mr Conti initially used standard magnets before using custom ones to make the product more secure. The device uses Neodymium magnets, the strongest type of commercial magnet available, to hold on to the bottle caps and the whole device attaches to the 'ceiling' of a fridge using special 3M tape . Design engineer Brian Conti, shown, from North Carolina came up with the revolutionary idea. The 46-year-old said: 'The idea came through observing a problem - specifically what to do about my crowded fridge.'

"This week sees the final act in the long-running Pistorius trial, with the athlete set to discover his fate - whether a lengthy prison sentence or parole. But an explosive new book written by a journalist who has covered the trial from start to finish and was the first on the scene following Miss Steenkamp's death has raised new questions about the trial. In Behind the Door, Barry Bateman argues that the prosecution ignored crucial evidence about Miss Steenkamp's final moments. Scroll down for video . Ignoring the evidence: Bateman claims that the prosecution ignored evidence about the night of the killing . The evidence hinges on whether or not Miss Steenkamp flushed the toilet in the moments leading up to her death, with Bateman arguing that the noise of the flushing toilet should have alerted Pistorius to his girlfriend's whereabouts. 'With the help of private forensic investigators, we've established Reeva Steenkamp probably flushed the toilet moments before her boyfriend, Oscar Pistorius, shot her,' he explains. 'But neither the state nor the defence presented this flushing – an event in the timeline – as evidence. Why?' The crux of the defence case focused on the idea that a terrified Pistorius, fearing an intruder, shot Steenkamp after hearing noises from the bathroom. Deciding his fate: Pistorius arriving at the courthouse in Pretoria this morning ahead of sentencing . Conviction: Pistorius could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison following his culpable homicide conviction . Bateman, who hired private investigator Kobus Steyl to look into the question of whether or not the toilet was flushed before Miss Steenkamp was shot, says that the evidence suggests that it was. 'Defence expert Roger Dixon also believed that Steenkamp flushed the toilet, and that this further proved Pistorius' version of events,' explains Bateman. 'As he said to me, ""This was the third startle [fright for Pistorius]. It destroys the state’s case totally. With the third startle, his worst fears are confirmed.' However Bateman believes that, rather than proving his innocence, Miss Steenkamp flushing the toilet moments before being shot by Pistorius actually raises questions about his story. Pistorius testified that after hearing the noise in the bathroom, he fetched his firearm and proceeded down the cupboard-lined passage,' he explains. Claims: Journalist Barry Bateman (right) says evidence was overlooked during the trial of Pistorius (left) Justice:  June and Barry Steenkamp, have frequently spoken of their desire to get justice for their daughter . In his evidence, Pistorius said: 'I started screaming and shouting for the burglar or the intruders to get out of my house. I shouted for Reeva to get down on the floor. 'I shouted for her to phone the police. I screamed at the people, the persons (sic) to get out.' According to the athlete, the sound of the toilet door slamming shut was enough to convince him that intruders were indeed in the house. 'I was not sure if someone was going to come out of the toilet to attack me,' he said, while giving evidence during the trial. 'I was not sure if someone was going to come up the ladder and point a firearm in the house and start shooting, so I just stayed where I was and kept on screaming.' Questions: The issue of whether or not Miss Steenkamp flushed the toilet was ignored by the prosecution . Final act: Sentencing could take several days and follows a trial that lasted for more than three months . 'It was at this point Pistorius said he heard a noise from inside the cubicle,' says Bateman. 'He later said he believed was the magazine rack moving, which prompted him to open fire four times. 'But it’s at this point forensic experts believe Steenkamp flushed the toilet. Would she have done so if her boyfriend was just a few arms' lengths away screaming frantically at an intruder to get out of the house and for her to call the police?' Although Pistorius and his attorney Brian Webber did not respond to Bateman's inquiries, he says prosecution sources admit to leaving the evidence - which could have reinforced the state case against Pistorius - out. 'While the national prosecuting authority did not respond to questions, a source in the state’s team said prosecutor Gerrie Nel did not introduce this evidence because there were simply too many possibilities to consider,' explains Bateman. While Pistorius waits to discover his fate, it seems that questions remain.","Barry Bateman was the first journalist on the scene following shooting .

"Britain's contributions to the EU have quadrupled to £11.3 billion in just five years, official figures revealed this morning. It means each family in the UK now sends £450 a year to Brussels on average – up £350 from the £100 bill in 2008 – according to the Office for National Statistics figures. The soaring bill comes before the latest demand for an extra £1.7billion, which David Cameron has refused to pay by the December 1 deadline. The Office for National Statistics said Britain spent £11.3 billion more than it got back in 2013 . Today's revelation comes less than 24 hours after Treasury analysis emerged suggesting the Government had expected Britain's Brussels contributions would be £8.6billion in 2013 – some £2.7billion less than the real cost. The increase in Britain's contributions is because Britain's economy has grown more quickly than other EU countries. The net contributions include the UK's annual rebate, which increased from £3.1billion in 2012 to £3.7billion in 2013. In 2008 the UK paid £2.7 billion to Brussels - rising to £3.8 billion in 2009, £7.2 billion in 2010, £7.5 billion in 2011, £8.5 billion in 2012 and £11.3 billion in 2013. In its report on the UK's balance of payments, the ONS said: 'In 2013, the UK made a net contribution to the EU of £11.3 billion. This was an increase of £2.7 billion from the net contribution of £8.5 billion paid in 2012. 'The increase was mainly due to the £3 billion increase in the UK's total gross national income (GNI) contribution. 'The GNI contribution is calculated based on the UK's estimate of economic activity within a budget year relative to other EU countries and can increase and decrease from one year to the next. 'The UK, like other countries, receives a rebate on its contributions to the EU, and similarly to its GNI contribution, it can increase and decrease from one year to the next. 'In 2013, the rebate paid to the UK increased £0.6 billion to £3.7 billion, from £3.1 billion in 2012.' EU leaders: New foreign policy chief Donald Tusk (left), the outgoing European Council boss Herman Van Rompuy (centre left) and Jose Manuel Barroso (centre right), who is being replaced by Jean-Claude Juncker (right) as European Commission President . In the wake of the row over the £1.7billion bill, there has been a sharp rise in support for leaving the EU, according to a new poll by YouGov . The figures do not include the extra £1.7 billion demanded by the EU, which followed a reassessment of national incomes carried out by statistics authorities in each of the 28 member states, and led to large demands for extra money from Britain, the Netherlands, Italy and Greece, while countries including France and Germany stand to gain to the tune of hundreds of millions of euros. The Prime Minister has insisted he will not hand over 'anything like' the £1.7 billion demanded by the European Commission, and Nick Clegg said the UK 'can't and won't pay' by the deadline. The British government has been stunned by the demand, which emerged a week ago. The European Commission used rules dating back to 1995 and found Britain's economy has grown faster than expected, so must pay a greater share to Brussels. To add insult to injury, France will receive a £790million rebate because its economy is struggling. However, payments dating back to 2007 show how the payments to the European project have been quietly rising. A major cause has been Tony Blair's decision to agree to a 7 per cut in the rebate during negotiations on the last seven-year budget deal. It cost Britain £7billion over seven years. Margaret Thatcher famously secured the rebate in 1984 by banging the table and demanding 'our own money back' during a summit with European leaders in Fontainebleau, in France. New figures reveal the increased bill the UK faces, on top of the £11.3billion-a-year it already pays, is higher than any other EU country, because its economy has been growing faster than expected. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels . However, the rebate has fallen from £5.4billion in 2009 to only £3.7billion in 2013. Ukip leader Nigel Farage told MailOnline: 'Thank you Mr Blair for sacrificing a large chunk of the British rebate in return for absolutely nothing. 'Much of the money that has come back to Britain has been used to make rich landowners richer (through the Common Agriculture Policy). 'The question is no longer can we afford to leave, it is can we afford to stay.' Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, which is campaigning for fundamental reform of the EU, said: 'Despite David Cameron securing a historic EU budget cut, the cost of the EU to UK taxpayers continues to spiral out of control. 'We cannot continue to write bigger and bigger cheques to remain a member of an unreformed and uncompetitive European Union. Business is struggling under mounds of EU red tape and the UK economy is threatened by yet another potential eurozone recession. 'We must secure a new deal from Brussels and that will only be possible through a referendum.' A new poll released yesterday showed there had been a sharp shift in public opinion about the EYU in the wake of the latest demand for more money. YouGov found a week ago that only 40 per cent of people would vote to leave the EU, with 41 per cent wanting to stay. But now 44 per cent say they would leave, with only 35 per cent wanting to stay. Nick Clegg travelled to Paris today for talks with the French prime minister to seek support for renegotiating the EU's demand for £1.7 billion in additional funding.","UK handed over £11.3billion in 2013 up from £2.7billion in 2008, says ONS .

"Don’t get me wrong. Watching Amir Khan on a Floyd Mayweather card, in the wee small hours from Las Vegas, was a wonderful thing. However, Wembley Stadium, full house, local rivalry, and during pub hours… well that was something else entirely. Sport-on-the-telly fans have been somewhat spoilt for choice for action from the FA’s headquarters recently. Culminating, you could be forgiven for thinking, with England’s parting shot before Rio. Not a bit of it, because Carl Froch and George Groves decided they would take their problem with each other outside. It was, unfortunately, a double whammy if you wanted to see what the organisers did with the place in 24 hours flat. Firstly, you’d have to be someone who has bought into the principle of buying lots of your sport. And secondly, you’d have had to cough up extra to watch it live on Sky’s Box Office service. What a picture! Sportsmail's Kevin Quigley captures Wembley in all its glory on Saturday night . Winner: Carl Froch beat George Groves with an 8th round knockout in front of 80,000 at Wembley . Big shot: Froch landed a massive right hand in the eighth round that knocked the young challenger out . All over: The Cobra looks down on Saint George after landing the decisive blow as viewers were in for a treat . I shall light that particular blue touch paper, and now gracefully retire from it. Because what is fundamentally important here is that between the channel and the event organisers, they put on a televisual experience that really said to me that the new Wembley has now arrived. Those who didn’t go the whole hog and fork out £17 for the full night - and I imagine there were plenty of pubs, clubs and front rooms full of people who had all chipped in and did - were given a taste of what was to come for a tantalising 45 minutes on Sky Sports. Johnny Nelson was tasked with being the host for the evening. Although he is clearly not a super slick live outside broadcast TV anchor, he certainly is a natural performer, with plenty of charm and, of course, tremendous boxing knowledge. He was ‘pitchside’ for the night on a raised platform alongside Glenn McCrory and David Haye - whose silver grey suit positively shimmered in the resplendent late afternoon sun. What’s more, Anthony Joshua also stepped out into the sunlight and promptly delivered a perfectly-timed first-round win - a glimpse of what was to come before the action switched exclusively to Sky Box Office. And as the sun started to set, so the scene was being set. As Kevin Mitchell was going about his business, the stadium began to fill up. But, more striking at that point than the sight of an enormous crowd, was the noise. There were still plenty of empty seats to be seen, but what could be heard was a hubbub that sounded like a torrent of rushing water. It was a maelstrom of excited chatter from tens of thousands of people all getting set for night to fall. During the fight, the crowd were shown on the big screens the interview with Groves on arrival we were also seeing at home. A reaction that commentator Nick Halling described as a ‘mixture’. And he wasn’t wrong. It was a mixture of loud booing, and really loud booing. Light show! Froch makes his way to the ring before defeating Groves in front of adoring supporters . The heat is on: Sky Sports and Wembley put on quite the show in front of millions of viewers at home . Into the night then, and now we were presented with the full package. A stunning overhead shot captured the majesty of the moment. The bubbling cauldron that we could see through the roof, with spotlights dancing into the air, and the tiny hotspot of the ring in a sea of bodies. While outside, lamp posts and passing traffic gave the impression that the streets were apparently paved with gold. Mind you, all the action wasn’t inside the ring. At around ten to 10, Groves was now running late and in danger of missing his bus. We saw a backstage shot of a rather flustered Sky Sports production assistant nervously explaining on his radio that he was unable to coax St George from his dressing room. Enter stage right Eddie Hearn who looked all set to go toe to toe with Groves himself. Just as he was about to shout the odds, the door flew open, and out strode Groves, looking very much ready for business. Knows how to put on a show! Groves' entrance for the bout was spectacular on a London bus . Earlier in the evening Froch had described the occasion as ‘proper gladiator days’.  And as he stood alone on a small stage, shadow boxing and soaking up the cacophony of sound from a dark abyss of people, the deal was sealed. Wembley burst out of the box. It had arrived. And of course it got a fight, and a finish, that justified the build-up - worthy of the occasion itself. Football is of course what Wembley is all about, but from what I watched in the corner of my room, this new incarnation of the stadium had just hosted a game of one-a-side that has rubber-stamped it as a sporting stage for something really special.","The package was worth the £17 charged on Box Office .

"Such was Alan Pardew’s desperation to win his first Tyne-Wear derby since 2011, he lost. With half an hour remaining and a fiery contest goalless, he turned to a 17-year-old Geordie playing for the first time in the fixture. Adam Armstrong was the romance card. Still without score some 15 minutes later, he gambled. Off came midfield enforcer Cheick Tiote to be replaced by Papiss Cisse, the half-fit striker who only needs half a chance to score a goal. He got one and missed. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has not taken a single point from his last four meetings with Sunderland . Sunderland winger Adam Johnson scored a late goal to seal a 1-0 win against rivals Newcastle United . Johnson is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring the dramatic winner against Alan Pardew's side . Then came the Joker, £12million flop Remy Cabella was introduced as Pardew played his final hand. Within two minutes it was Sunderland having the last laugh, exposing gaping holes in Newcastle’s midfield to break with unforgiving efficiency. Adam Johnson was the match-winner and, for the first time in derby history, a Newcastle manager had lost four on the bounce. The withdrawal of Tiote afforded Johnson the space to exploit. Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet knew as much, but was too canny to gloat. ‘I think Alan was brave, very, very brave,’ said the Uruguayan. ‘He put on as many strikers as he could to win the game and for 10 or 15 minutes, they gave us plenty of problems. ‘It was a very good and brave move from Alan. Now because of that, we were able to break and score the goal. With the game goalless and Pardew desperate for a winner, Gus Poyet's men capitalsed on some questionable managerial decisions from his opposite number . Poyet celebrates emphatically following Johnson's late goal against local rivals Newcastle at St James' Park . Johnson raises his arms in victory in front of the travelling Sunderland supporters at St James' Park . ‘It's unfair, but sometimes in football that happens. You put plenty of forward players on and you win it 2-0 or 3-0, or it can go the other way.’ There had, in fairness, been chances to win it for the hosts – Armstrong shot when he should have crossed to the unmarked Moussa Sissoko and Ayoze Perez was thwarted by Costel Pantilimon. Pardew even started one move himself with a half-volley down the touchline in an attempt to hurry a throw-in, but the efforts of he and his team were to end in despair, again. The Newcastle boss admits it was a case of misadventure. ‘We were always liable to overcommit,’ he said. ‘If we had one fault it was overcommitting in the end period of the game where you have to be disciplined, particularly given the history of this fixture where Sunderland have caught us on the break before and they have done it again.’ He did, though, defend the motivation behind the changes. Pardew called upon 17-year-old Adam Armstrong to play for the first time in the notoriously feisty fixture . The Magpies manager also brought off midfield custodian Cheik Tiote to bring on striker Papiss Cisse . ‘This club wants to see goals and I would never be manager here and accept a draw at home,’ he said. ‘We should still have the discipline in the team regardless of how many offensive players we have on. ‘If ever we were going to lose a game then do it in that manner, trying to push for a win. As much as we tried to, we just couldn’t get the goal.’ Brave, meanwhile, would be the best way to describe Steven Taylor’s headed clearance from the goal-line in the second half which kept the game level but was at the expense of a bloodied cheek when he clattered into the post. ‘Steven is hurting physically and mentally,’ said Pardew. ‘He had a couple of stitches but he’ll be okay.’ After three defeats in eight days, will Newcastle be okay? Next up is a trip to Manchester United on Boxing Day. ‘This compounds the defeats at Arsenal and Spurs. We have to lick our wounds and prepare quickly for Manchester United,’ added Pardew. ‘We’re still in a healthy position in the league. ‘It’s painful but this disappointment is different to what it felt like earlier in the season – you can see that our players gave everything.’ In giving everything, however, they ended up with nothing.","Sunderland's Tyne-Wear winning streak stretched to four games .

"Many say Bob Dylan's lyrics are unbeatable. That was before Bill Murray had his way with them. In a preview clip from his new movie St Vincent, the 69-year-old actor half mumbles  along to Shelter From The Storm as he tries and fails to water a seemingly dead plant. And if social media is anything to go by, the rendition is certified genius. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Legend': Bill Murray is up to his old tricks making the unremarkable completely fascinating in this clip . His bedraggled character Vincent retrieves his cigarettes from inside a plant pot before heaving himself onto a plastic green bench, singing while smoking. Slowly, he plods through his movements - absent-mindedly watering a plant that then falls over, throwing away his cigarette before immediately lighting another. But all the way, he is trying to keep up with Bob's crooning, occasionally bursting out into song when he catches on a line he knows well. One fan commented on the video released by the Weinstein Company on YouTube: 'It doesn't get better than this - two legends at the same time!' Another said: 'Why do I love this? I don't know why I love this. Please someone explain it to me.' And one exclaimed: 'BILL YOU ARE THE COOLEST DUDE ALIVE.' 'Masterpiece': He half-mumbles, half-wails Bob Dylan's Shelter From The Storm in his movie St Vincent . Multi-tasker: The 69-year-old seems completely at ease trying to water a seemingly dead plant while singing . Performance: It was all for the film but fans have taken the clip as yet another triumph for Bill Murray . Known for being non-chalant and eccentric, this moment that he sees the plant pot fall seems typical Murray . Soon-to-be-released: Murray stars as a drunk gambler in St Vincent, which comes out on October 24 . It is not the first time Murray has excited his fawning fans by turning something completely unremarkable into a work of art. Earlier this year, he sidled into a couple's engagement photos while on a walk in his hometown in South Carolina - sending the internet into some form of meltdown. That came after the twice-married actor gatecrashed a bachelor party with relationship advice, and weeks later turned up at an unwitting fan's Bill Murray Ice Cream Social. It seems even his co-stars in St Vincent, released on October 24, have attributed legendary status to the star. 'If you get a glimpse, the party follows him,' Naomi Watts, said at the Toronto Film Festival, which declared its second day Bill Murray Day. 'He is such a joy to work with and every day on set felt like a party.' Murray has no agent or manager, and uses a 1-800 phone number and messaging service to field calls from producers and directors eager for his involvement in their projects. Melfi, who also wrote the script for 'St. Vincent,' said he called the number dozens of times. Luckily for him, Murray finally called back. Ramp it up: Murray gave a more raucous performance on Saturday at a karaoke night in St Andrews, Scotland . Rocking it: He was accompanied by Don Felder and Bon Jovi's Tico Torres at the Alfred Dunhill party . 'I try not to write with someone in mind because if you don't get them, it's just depressing,' he said. 'But Bill's the perfect blend of bitter and sweet - and heaven and hell, really. And once I started thinking of him, I couldn't stop thinking of him.' The film tells the story of Vincent - who drinks, gambles, and lives alone but has periodic visits with a pregnant Russian prostitute - and his unlikely friendship with the scrawny kid who moves in next door. After a rousing audience reception at the world premiere, reviews have been mixed, with the BBC saying that the crowd 'responded on Pavlovian cue to the film's cutesy, aging-rebel theatrics, but, really, Bill Murray deserves a better movie.' Yet Variety called the Weinstein Company movie a 'window into the actor's own soul', which it describes as 'a ticket to movie heaven.' The Bob Dylan performance, sung along to a cassette player, is slightly more subdued than the high-octane karaoke performance Murray gave in St Andrews last night. Accompanied by Bon Jovi drummer Tico Torres, he treating golfers at Alfred Dunhill Links Championship to a few roaring crowd-pleasers at a post-game party - while clad in cow-print trousers.","Actor, 69, sings the entire Bob Dylan song in a preview clip from new film .
