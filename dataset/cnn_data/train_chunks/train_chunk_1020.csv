We are a small independent and passionate New Zealand company that’s just finding its feet and believes Kiwis deserve the best dairy produce. We’ve been right so far with our butters and milk and cream, and wildly right with Chocolate Milk. Our equipment is running at full capacity and we are working around the clock to produce as much Chocolate Milk as we can. We do hope we will be able to source additional equipment to increase supply but it takes time and we won’t do anything that compromises the quality of our product.So bear with us New Zealand as we strive to improve our supply.

"Jose Mourinho has revealed he will give Chelsea's youngsters a chance in the first-team when the time is right. The Blues won the FA Youth Cup for a third time in five years after beating Fulham 7-6 over two legs earlier this month but many of the club's youngsters have failed to go on and make it in the Chelsea first-team. Asked when members of Chelsea's successful youth side would be given a chance in the first team, Mourinho, taking part in a Twitter Q&A session with Yahoo Sports, responded: 'I want it in the right time. I don't want them to come and not to succeed.' VIDEO Scroll down to look back at some of Jose's funniest moments this season . Question time: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho took part in a Q&A via Yahoo Sport's Twitter page on Friday . All about timing: Jose Mourinho has revealed he will give Chelsea's youngsters a chance 'in the right time' Glory: Chelsea celebrate winning the FA Youth Cup after staging a dramatic comeback over Fulham this month . Delirium: Chelsea players and coaching staff celebrate Dominic Solanke's dramatic winner in stoppage time . Answers: Mourinho answered a varied array of questions from fans across the globe . With a host of talented youngsters at his disposal, the Chelsea boss also revealed his perfect signing would be a player with potential who he could later sell-on for a big transfer fee. Perhaps with an eye on Financial Fair Play, when asked who he would choose to sign if he could buy shares in any player, Mourinho said: 'I would buy cheap shares so go to cheap markets where I could find big potential and years later make money.' Meanwhile, the Chelsea manager has admitted he would love to stay at Stamford Bridge for at least the next decade. However, with many Premier League clubs accused of sacking managers too quickly, the 'Special One' accepts it may not be possible to remain in the hotseat for such a long period of time. Chelsea themselves have had eight managers since Mourinho's first spell came to an end in 2007. Asked where he sees himself in 10 years time, the former Porto, Inter Milan and Real Madrid boss said: 'Still coaching a big team, I would love to say Chelsea but I understand modern football. 10 years is a long time.' Here to stay? Mourinho revealed he would love to still be coaching at Chelsea in a decade's time . With the season over after Chelsea failed to claim a trophy during Mourinho's return to west London, the 51-year-old is already working ahead of the next campaign and will continue to do so, even on holiday. Revealing he will work to the end of June, Mourinho said: 'From then to mid-July I enjoy holidays but know that the phone and pad are with me.' While Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is expected to join for the Blues this summer, Mourinho delved into Chelsea history for another transfer when one fan asked: 'If you could sign any player past or present, dead or alive, who would it be?' Mourinho replied: 'For Chelsea, I go for Peter Osgood. He is important part of Chelsea history.' The Blues legend, who sadly passed away in 2006, scored over 100 goals for the club during two spells in the 60s and 70s. Dream signing: Mourinho said Chelsea legend Peter Osgood was an important part of the club's history . @Pav_S1994 Where do you see yourself in 10 years?

"It should be straightforward: Arsenal head to Wembley in top form, Hull have been struggling, so Arsene Wenger, in all likelihood, will land that elusive trophy. Right? Wrong. Cup finals never play out as smoothly as you hope. Tensions and anxieties have a habit of affecting performances and Wenger will be aware that the  biggest threat to his ambitions comes from within. In many ways, Arsenal are the ones who will stop Arsenal winning. Complacency, more than anything, is their biggest opponent now and the comfortable 3-0 win they recorded at Hull last month might actually jeopardise their chances, rather than providing a pointer to success. Reason to be cheerful: Arsenal are big favourites to beat Hull at Wembley and win the FA Cup . Relaxed: Jack Wilshere and Co were all smiles in training ahead of the final at Wembley . Head up: Arsene Wenger hopes to end Arsenal's nine-year wait for a trophy on Saturday . Liverpool . were in a similar position in 2006. We went to the last FA Cup final at . the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff as long odds-on favourites to brush . aside West Ham and the vast majority who tuned in thought it would be a . formality. Nobody . said anything like that in our dressing room. There was no sign of . cockiness or arrogance but, deep down, maybe we believed that would be . the case, too. After all, we had enjoyed a strong finish to the . Barclays Premier League  campaign, including a comfortable 2-1 win over . West Ham. Rafa . Benitez made a number of changes that night at Upton Park but, even . though we finished with 10 men after Luis Garcia was sent off, we were . never seriously pressed. With our strongest team out in Cardiff three . weeks later, it should have been a breeze. How wrong we were. For some reason, we never got going and paid the heaviest price for a dreadful start,  trailing 2-0. Maybe . subconsciously we were overconfident and only an extraordinary . performance from Steven Gerrard helped save the day, as we scrambled . over the line on penalties. So . the warning signs are there. What also prevents you having unshakeable . confidence in Arsenal is previous games of this nature: the ghosts of . the 2011 League  Cup final against Birmingham still haunt Wenger, while . they struggled to get past Wigan in this year’s semi-final. They . needed penalties to win then, having looked at one point as if they . would crash out. It should also be remembered Arsenal have yet to win a . game outright at the new Wembley, having lost a 2009 FA Cup semi-final . to Chelsea. If . this were a Premier League game, you wouldn’t foresee anything other . than an Arsenal win as Wenger’s side have been ruthlessly efficient in . dispatching inferior opponents, but the stage, the stakes and the . pressure mean there have to be doubts on Saturday afternoon. Nightmare: The last time Arsenal reached a Wembley final, they lost 2-1 to Birmingham in the League Cup . Underdogs: Birmingham lifted the Carling Cup to extend Arsenal's trophy-less stretch . Rounded: Didier Drogba scores for Chelsea against Arsenal in the 2009 FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . For . Hull to win, they need to make it a physical game, as Arsenal still . fail to deal with such demands. They will miss their cup-tied strikers, . Nikica Jelavic and Shane Long, but perhaps it will give Steve Bruce the . chance to spring a surprise with his tactics. He has used a three-man . defence at times this season but will he change to accommodate whoever . plays up front? Bruce . will have Jake Livermore and Tom Huddlestone, two former Tottenham men, . sitting in the engine room, trying to orchestrate a win. If they can . launch counter-attacks, Arsenal might find themselves in difficulty. If . Hull were to open the scoring, it would really test the character of . Wenger’s men. Arsenal . are guaranteed to have plenty of possession, but if Hull get everyone . behind the ball, it won’t be easy for the favourites to find a way . through — Wembley is a slow pitch and requires patience, which is why . the first goal will be crucial. Any doubts Arsenal have about themselves . will surface if they go behind. Back to fitness: Aaron Ramsey was on the scoresheet as Arsenal cruised past Hull in their Premier League clash . Making plans? A sign in Islington watns of road closures the day after the FA Cup final . In charge: Hull manager Steve Bruce has led his team to Premier League safety and the cup final . However, . with Aaron Ramsey back and in great form — where would the title have . gone had he stayed fit? — Arsenal should win and it would be nice to see . Wenger lift a trophy once more after all he has done for our game. I . have the utmost respect and admiration for him and his reign needs . another moment to savour before he moves on. Equally, . there are few English managers in the game with trophies on their CV. Looking at the final Premier League table, it was  alarming to realise . that of the 20 managers who finished the season, only five were English . and none has lifted a major honour. Delight: Liverpool were given a huge scare before beating West Ham on penalties in the 2006 FA Cup final . Late and great: Steven Gerrard's injury-time strike rescued Liverpool as they won on penalties . Pushed aside: Hull City will be without cup-tied striker Nikica Jelavic at Wembley . End of season: Striker Shane Long will also miss the showpiece in north London . Bruce, who has done an excellent job this season, now has a glorious opportunity to put that right.Given . the influx of foreign owners and coaches, it would be fitting to see . him hoist the trophy and join a select group who have won the FA Cup as a . player and manager. There . is no doubt Bruce has been deeply disappointed with the way Hull’s form . has tailed off. Wembley has clearly been a distraction. Should . Arsenal take their eye off the ball, though, they will be wound . up to take advantage — and make sure it is anything but straightforward. Engine: Tom Huddlestone (left) and Jake Livermore (right) will be at the heart of Hull's midfield . On board: Livermore leads the Hull players onto their flight at Humberside Airport . Farewell to the peerless Puyol . The curtain comes down this weekend on the career of Carles Puyol, one of the  all-time great defenders. Puyol’s retirement will be a blow to everyone at Barcelona. The club are losing an icon, his  team-mates are losing a leader and the supporters are losing a player who represented their values. Tiki-taka is the term you associate with Barcelona but you wouldn’t necessarily use that to describe Puyol, who is tough, uncompromising with an indomitable spirit. Those qualities, however, are what I believe made him special. Playing as a central defender for Barcelona cannot be easy. Yes, they are a great team, but the way they attack leaves defenders exposed and it speaks volumes for his ability that he was as important to Pep Guardiola’s all-conquering team as Xavi, Leo Messi and Andres Iniesta. He was the man of steel who led them into battle. Goodbye: Barcelona will bid farewell to Carles Puyol at the end of this season . Glittering: Puyol won six La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues with the Catalans . Having . won almost every major honour in football — the Europa League is all . that is missing from what would be the perfect set — Puyol bows out with . one of finest CVs you could wish to see and he is the perfect example . to every player of what you can achieve if you have desire, persistence . and are prepared to work. He . always had a ferocious will to win and determination — and don’t . underestimate the influence he had on the magicians around him. As someone who played in my position, Puyol will forever have my respect.","Arsenal face Hull in FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday .

"The mixed martial artist known as 'War Machine' has tried to commit suicide while in jail awaiting trial on the attempted murder of his pornstar ex-girlfriend Christy Mack. The fighter, whose real name is Jonathan Koppenhaver, was found unresponsive about 9:30pm Tuesday by a corrections officer walking by his cell at Clark County jail,TMZ reported. The 32-year-old MMA fighter was found on the ground and unconscious by a guard, according to the site. Rushing to help, the prison guard was able to call for help and medical aid was administered to the martial artist. Koppenhaver, who left a suicide note near his bed, remains in medical isolation while on suicide watch, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, a mixed martial arts fighter known as War Machine, attempted suicide while in jail waiting trial on attempted murder charges . Mack, 23, says that attack left her with 18 broken bones around her eyes, a nose broken in two places, and hair sawed off by a knife . Koppenhaver pleaded not guilty in September to 32 felony charges including attempted murder during his first appearance in a Las Vegas courtroom. Prosecutors, who originally charged Jonathan Koppenhaver with nine felony counts in connection with the beating of his ex-girlfriend, added about two dozen more charges that stretch back to May 2013. The new charges include allegations of burglary, first-degree kidnapping, coercion and sexual assault. Justice of the Peace Melanie Tobiasson ordered Koppenhaver held without bail. The 32-year-old MMA fighter was arrested in a hotel room in a Los Angeles suburb on August 15, one week after allegedly beating his former girlfriend, Christy Mack, so severely she feared for her life. Mack, 23, told police that the 'War Machine' on August 8 showed up unannounced at her house where she and friend, Corey Thomas, were sleeping. She said Koppenhaver began beating Thomas, before sending him away with the threat that he would have friends kill him if he reported the assault. Mack, seen here in a self portrait she posted on Instagram, told police she had no idea how many times she was hit . Mack told Las Vegas police that the fighter then turned his attention to her and started attacking her, as he scrolled through her text messages. According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver. Mack said she escaped, naked, out of a back door when the fighter went to the kitchen, where she thought he was fetching a knife. She later posted a statement online that she feared for her life when Koppenhaver allegedly sawed off her hair with a dull knife. Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Koppenhaver after Mack posted the graphic photos of her injuries online on August 11 . She wrote: 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning (August 8), Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego. 'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me. 'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating. 'My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in two places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.' Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth. She also said she could not walk on her own, and had a fractured rib and ruptured liver from a kick to her side. 'I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen,' she wrote. 'He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife. 'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. Koppenhaver, who pleaded not guilty, was ordered held without bail during his initial appearance in court Wednesday . 'He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts. ' Mack said her ex-boyfriend threatened to rape her. 'He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard. 'After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.' Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife. 'I ran out my back door, shutting it behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house. 'Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought to the hospital and treated for my injuries.' Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she dealt with beatings and infidelity in the past. After she put the graphic images online on August 11, the authorities issued a warrant for Koppenhaver and he became the subject of a manhunt. The welterweight fighter made his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut in 2007. He legally changed his name in 2008. He lost his only pay-per-view bout that same year. He fought out of San Diego for a variety of promotions and had a 14-5 record as a welterweight. He lost his last fight, in Iowa, last October.","Jonathan Koppenhaver tried to hang himself by tying a linen to his jail bed .

"President Barack Obama, in a chilling assessment of international efforts to stem a deadly Ebola outbreak, said the world has not done enough to respond to a health crisis that poses a growing threat to regional and global security. 'There is still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be,' Obama said Thursday in remarks to a high-level United Nations meeting on Ebola. The U.S. president asserted that 'if we move fast, even if imperfectly, then that could mean the difference between 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 deaths versus hundreds of thousands or even a million deaths.' President Barack Obama told members of the U.N. General Assembly today that their countries needed do more to stop the spread of Ebola . During his address at the United Nations meeting in New York Obama said the U.S. does not have the capacity to fight Ebola on its own . The crisis in West Africa is the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, with more than 6,200 people believed to have been sickened, almost half of whom have died. U.S. health officials have warned that the number of infected people could explode to at least 1.4 million by mid-January, though they have also cautioned that the totals could peak well below that if efforts to control the outbreak are ramped up. 'So, this is not one where there should be a lot of wrangling and people waiting to who else is doing what,' Obama said today. Margaret Chan, director of the World Health Organization, addressed the Ebola meeting ahead of Obama and warned that the outbreak will likely get worse before it gets better. The virus, she said, is 'still running ahead, jumping over everything we put in place to slow it down.' Obama has dispatched 3,000 U.S. troops to Liberia to set up facilities and form training teams to help the Africans treat Ebola victims. On Thursday, top lawmakers in Congress also approved the use of leftover Afghanistan war money to begin funding Obama's $1 billion request to help fight the outbreak. While Obama touted the progress the U.S. has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done. 'I want us to be clear. We are not moving fast enough. We are not doing enough,' Obama said. 'Right now everybody has the best intentions, but people are not putting in the kinds of resources that are necessary to put a stop to this epidemic.' Obama said the U.S. would continue to lead the fight but emphasized that preventing a worldwide epidemic has to be 'a priority for everyone else,' too. 'We cannot do this alone,' the U.S. president said. 'We don't have the capacity to do all of this by ourselves.' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also urged world leaders to 'step up' efforts to fight Ebola.","Obama said the U.S. would continue to lead the fight but emphasized that preventing a worldwide epidemic has to be 'a priority for everyone else'

The former Newcastle midfielder, an integral figure under Kevin Keegan and Kenny Dalglish in the 1990s, was aghast when Ashley ruled cup competitions are of secondary importance — branding the stance ‘shocking.’ He claimed Ashley was abusing the ‘incredible’ loyalty of Tyneside fans and warned that this latest clash could rebound on him. ‘Let’s see what happens when the draw is made for the third round of the FA Cup,’ he said. ‘If Newcastle land a home tie, they could be playing in front of an empty stadium. Midfield grafter: Lee was a mainstay of the Newcastle team in the 1990s and is shocked by Ashley's attitude . Shocked: Former Newcastle midfielder has claimed that Mike Ashley is abusing the loyalty of fans . ‘Newcastle fans are incredibly loyal — far and away the best in the country for continually backing their team — but they’re not stupid. ‘The club have effectively said the cups don’t matter, so what’s the point in turning up? They’ll surely stay away and I wouldn’t blame them one bit. What I’d like to know is, if they’re not going for the cups, what are they going for? Are they going for the title? Of course not. ‘There are very few teams with a realistic chance of winning the League and Newcastle aren’t one of them. So what’s left? Staying up, it seems. Judging by what they are saying, that is the extent of their ambition and I find it truly shocking. I just don’t understand it. ‘They’ve killed the season before it’s even started. These fans have got nothing to look forward to and that can’t  possibly be right. You’ve got to give fans like Newcastle’s some hope and excitement and the fact is they can win one of the cups. Wigan and Birmingham have both shown it is perfectly  possible and the argument from Newcastle’s board that they both went down just fills me with despair. Decision: Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has ruled cup competitions are of secondary importance . ‘If we are comparing ourselves with Wigan Athletic and  Birmingham City, then we have got problems. That’s not meant as a cheap shot against those two clubs, but we are talking about Newcastle United and 50,000 Geordies filling the ground every home game.’ Lee has first-hand experience of how Cup final fever grips Tyneside after playing in 2-0 defeats by Arsenal and  Manchester United in 1998 and 1999. ‘We almost made it three in a row after reaching the semi-final in 2000, only to lose 2-1 to Chelsea,’ he said. ‘We didn’t play particularly well in either final and couldn’t quite deliver the trophy the fans were desperate for, but those Cup runs were something else. Cup agony: Lee was part of the Newcastle team that lost consecutive FA Cup finals in 1998 and 1999 . Early exit: Alan Pardew's Newcastle were knocked out of the FA Cup third round by Cardiff in January . ‘The place came alive all the more with each round we played. It was fantastic for the Newcastle public and you can never question what the Cup means to them or doubt the excitement it generates.‘It was all they talked about at the end of the Nineties, but what have they got to talk about now? There’s no point to next season for them now and you wonder whether Mike  Ashley realises what the  cups mean to the people of Newcastle. I think he probably does, but it doesn’t seem to bother him if he upsets people. ‘We’re talking about the FA Cup, for crying out loud. Ashley knows they’ll keep renewing their season tickets and filling the ground, no matter what. They are the most loyal bunch around, but it is to their own detriment sometimes and that is such a shame.’ Loud and clear: Newcastle fans hold up a banner in protest against Pardew and Ashley earlier this month .","The former Newcastle midfielder was aghast when Ashley ruled cup competitions are of secondary importance .

"Playing Rafael Nadal on clay is the cruellest form of sport, and as if Andy Murray did not know that already he got a painful reminder of it again on Friday night. More than two and a half years since last facing the Spaniard the Wimbledon champion produced his best tennis of the year, his best since that heady fortnight of last summer, and still it was not enough. Murray threw almost everything he had at the world number one but as the bell tolled midnight was edged out of their Italian Open quarter final 1-6, 6-3, 7-5, having created enough chances to score one of the finest wins of his career. Delight: Rafael Nadal celebrates after beating Andy Murray in the quarter-finals of the Italian Open in Rome . Long battle: The Spaniard had to work hard to get past Murray who won the first set comfortably . Respect: The pair shake hands after a titanic battle . If this had been on grass, with the . margins of self-belief tilted slightly in the opposite directions, then . he would surely have closed this one out after working so hard to go 4-2 . ahead in a thrilling decider. But . this was the brown dust that Nadal was borne into, and his marginally . sterner resolve and skill in the environment saw him pull through in . time-honoured fashion. That . the Spaniard celebrated afterwards as if he had just retained the French . Open title was testament to the trial he was put through, and there . were ample consolations for the 27 year-old Scot in defeat. Having . wobbled over the loss of Ivan Lendl, and at times looked bereft in . scrambling around for the form he enjoyed before last September’s back . surgery, this was a statement that his talents have survived it all. Running out of energy: After being broken back in the third set Murray struggled to recover . Fast start: Murray flew out of the blocks against Nadal and took the first set 6-1 to shock the Spaniard . Number one: But Nadal really had to dig in against the Brit on his return to form . It . was little surprise that there was some bitter-sweet feeling . afterwards, with Murray reflecting, “I thought I did pretty well, and I . was expecting to start playing better around this time. I don’t think . some people have quite respected what it’s like to have back surgery and . come back from that. 'But . I’m disappointed with how I played at 4-2, it was a poor game. I rushed a . bit and against someone like Rafa you don’t get many chances.' A . couple of unforced errors betrayed him at that point, but overall . Lendl’s legacy was there in his pounding of Nadal’s backhand side and . sustained aggression. At the end Nadal finished the stronger and broke . to love at 5-5, helped by a double fault. He believed more. The . opening was not just Murray’s best set of tennis since Wimbledon but up . with the best of his career as he gave the great Spaniard a rare . chasing to take it in just 37 minutes. Finally: Nadal celebrates with a fist pump after securing victory . Struggling: The pair hadn't played each other for almost three years, and it was obvious Nadal wasn't comfortable . Passion: Murray roars in celebration after a long point during that first set in Rome . Concentration: The Spaniard regrouped and never looked back . A . cool evening with slight drizzle probably helped as it took a fraction . of the sting from Nadal’s heavily spun strokes. But it is hard to recall . the Murray backhand being delivered with more laserlike accuracy, and . he used it to open the court up, choosing wisely when to fire it down . the line to test his opponent’s stronger forehand side. At . 5-0 the capacity crowd packed into the steep banks of the Foro . Italico’s Court Centrale could scarcely believe the domination being . exercised over the seven-times champion at this historic venue. Twice . previously this week Nadal has been forced into a third set, and while . that might have sapped even his legs he recovered right on cue. Murray . had a big chance when he created a break point in the second set’s . opening game but that was saved with a massive, outswinging ace to the . backhand side. The Spaniard also attacked the net to great effect from . the second set onwards – he remains the sport’s great problem solver. Nadal now plays rising star Grigor Dimitrov while in the other semi-final Novak Djokovic takes on Canadian Milos Raonic.","Rafael Nadal beats Andy Murray 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 at Italian Open .

"Finals fan: Former Wasps and England star, now BT Sport pundit, Laurence Dallaglio enjoyed the back-end of the season as a player . Lawrence Dallaglio adores May’s league . play-offs. Better weather. Faster tracks. Bigger crowds. Trophies on . offer. A chance to upset the odds. In . his pomp as the English back rower everyone loved to hate, his Wasps . side became masters in timing their run from the pack to peak at just . the right moment. Three . years in succession they finished second in the pecking order but when . the Premiership trophy was handed out at Twickenham a few weeks later, . the roles were reversed. Gloucester, Bath and Leicester, teams that . finished ahead of Wasps in the regular season, were all swatted aside in . consecutive showpiece deciders from 2003 to 2005. It’s . a trend not confined to England. Topping the PRO12 table and securing . the No 1 seeding for the play-offs has been no precursor to . end-of-season glory. Just once in the four seasons so far since doing . away with the first-past-the-post system has the No 1 team lifted the . trophy. Leinster have suffered twice, losing . finals after leading the way into May, and they are now in that . dangerous position again having topped the pile with no guarantee of a . title. ‘It’s . exciting,’ enthuses Dallaglio. ‘The play-offs are here to stay now. Obviously, I enjoyed the concept [as a player] because we didn’t moan . about them when they were introduced, we just got on and made sure we . were well placed to win. Last hurrah: Brian O'Driscoll could play his last game in the Pro12 semi-final against Ulster on Saturday . ‘When . you have international rugby that is played at the same time as club . rugby and your best players, your international players, are taken away . from you for a third of the season then to have a first-past-the-post . situation is not really appropriate. ‘The . play-offs are fair and equitable. It allows you to continue to produce . players for international rugby without a club being penalised for them . being taken away from you.’ The . concept isn’t completely perfect, though. As someone who prided himself . on being the best player he could be for his country, he believes it’s . unfair that Test rugby has been pencilled in across the southern . hemisphere on June 7 just a week after the finals in the various . European leagues. ‘Maybe . in another year we might get some common sense and the people who are . planning things might plan things a little bit better,’ he says, . dissatisfied that England, Ireland and France will all have very little . time to prepare for their summer tours. Triumph: Dallaglio lifts the 2007 Heineken Cup trophy at Twickenham as the captain of Wasps . Fairytale: Dallaglio says it would be brave to bet against O'Driscoll enjoying the perfect finale . The Premiership is where Dallaglio . still earns a crust, swopping his boots for the BT Sport mic. He was . rostered in for Friday night’s semi-final between Northampton and . Leicester (won 21-20 by Saints) but will be keeping an eye on the PRO12, particularly to see . whether Brian O’Driscoll leaves Leinster behind the same way he did . Ireland - with a trophy in his hand. Dallaglio . was the boogie man who inspired Wasps to ruin Martin Johnson’s going . away party in 2005, going on at the time about how all the talk about . the World Cup winning skipper retiring wound up the Londoners’ dressing . room. The sense of mischief should naturally be similar in the Ulster . dressing room. As much . as they respect O’Driscoll they will want to send him into retirement on . a bum note, but Dallaglio believes there is no reason why the Irish . legend can’t go out on a high. ‘When you have players of the stature of . Martin Johnson and Brian O’Driscoll, then naturally there is going to be . a huge amount written, quite rightly, about their success and the . build-up to the fairytale ending. ‘Brian . O’Driscoll will want to have a say in that as well and being the . quality player he is there is no reason why the best players in the . world can’t go out winning trophies… it would take a tough man to back . against him.’ Retired . himself since 2008, Dallaglio, an England World Cup 2015 ambassador, was . in Limerick on Thursday to co-present with Keith Wood at the first . European Sports Tourism summit. Legends: O'Driscoll (left) with Jonny Wilkinson after Toulon knocked Leinster out of the Heineken Cup . While there he admits he detected a . sense of hunger for Ireland to dream aloud and pitch for the 2023 World . Cup. Having been involved in England’s operation, he suggests there is . no obstacle to a competitive bid. ‘There . is no reason why Ireland can’t put together a very credible and strong . bid that would require the collaboration of the whole country. I know it . has been talked about and I’m sure it will continue to be something to . be talked about and will gather more momentum and pace. ‘There seems to . be a huge appetite to take a potential bid to the next stage. There . needs to be a lot of agreement and discussion, and it will also need to . involve various stakeholders which is the Irish government, the various . cities that could potentially host the tournament and the different . sports as well like soccer and GAA. ‘Clearly, . in the same way in England the rugby community couldn’t host a . tournament of this size on its own, I’m sure Ireland would agree that . they would probably need to reach out to everyone in the country. ‘There’s . lots of learning and sharing, isn’t there? The World Cup is the third . biggest sports event on the planet and it’s quite hard to believe it’s . now less than 500 days to go.’ Former England skipper . Lawrence Dallaglio believes there is no greater sport than rugby to help . disadvantaged kids get their lives back on track. His . Dallaglio Foundation has raised £7million for a variety of charities . since 2009 and he’s especially inspired that the opportunity he provides . to play rugby has been snapped up by numerous teenagers. ‘Rugby . was a big part of my life and I feel very strongly we have a duty and . responsibility to give back. Setting up the foundation allows me to . channel that energy into something I feel very passionate about. ‘I . run a rugby programme that goes all over the UK and delivers rugby to . kids that have even been excluded or expelled from school. The values . around the game have got the ability to help those types of young people . turn their lives around,’ he said. ‘They . can benefit from the support system which the values of the game . provides. Rugby is about collective responsibility and doing things . together. The difference between young kids who are successful and get . on in life tend to be the support they receive, not just from their . parents but from the wider community. 'Rugby . certainly gave me a direction and focus in my life. I’m not talking . about all these kids becoming Test rugby players but what it does is it . builds up their confidence, builds up their self-esteem.’","Former England and Wasps star Dallaglio is a big supporter of finals series .

"The wife of a former Mexican mayor reportedly ordered the murder of 43 student teachers, who have since gone missing after being taken into custody by police and allegedly handed over to a drug gang. Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa, wife of Jose Luis Abarca, who used to be mayor of the town of Iguala, is said to be the 'key operator' of crime in the town according to the Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) cartel. She ordered the police to arrest 43 students she thought were about to ruin a party she'd organised for herself and hand them over to the murderous gang, according to a news website. Scroll down for video . Fugitives: Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa (left), wife of Jose Luis Abarca (right) is said to be the 'key operator' of criminal activity in the Mexican town of Iguala but is now on the run after allegedly having a hand in the disappearance of 43 students . The students went missing on September 26 and it's Pineda who has blood on her hands, The Daily Beast reported. It said that as she was about to deliver a speech on Iguala's plaza in which she would put the case for succeeding her husband forward, she was told that a group of students planned to disrupt proceedings. To stop this happening, the site said, she ordered the police to deal with them. Police then allegedly opened fire on the students after they stopped the buses they were travelling in, killing several, and driving others away on the orders of Guerreros Unidos' chief hitman, 'Chucky'. She was able to issue these instructions because she is apparently at the top of the criminal underworld tree in Iguala. A woman places a candle on photos of the missing missing students during a protest against the disappearance of 43 students from the Isidro Burgos rural teachers college, in Mexico City . According to Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam, the cartel's leader, Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado, describes her as 'the main operator of criminal activities in Iguala'. Forensic experts have combed through 11 clandestine graves discovered in the area during the hunt for the students. The sites contained 38 bodies, but there has been no confirmation that any of them belong to the missing students. It appears that the students had no intention of disrupting Pineda's speech, but were merely travelling through the town on buses they'd hired to take them to Mexico City for a remembrance service in honour of students massacred there in 1968. Mr Karam said this week that it was in fact the mayor who ordered the police to confront the students, citing testimony from several officers that have been arrested during the investigation into the case. Meanwhile, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto yesterday met with parents of the 43 missing students for the first time since they disappeared. Forensic examiners stand atop a garbage-strewn hillside in the densely forested mountains outside Cocula, in Guerrero state, Mexico, where authorities are searching for remains of the missing students . The mothers and fathers of the missing have grown increasingly frustrated at the pace of the investigation. The case has shaken the image of improving security that the government has sought to project since Pena Nieto took office in 2012. After meeting for about six hours inside the Los Pinos presidential residence, parents said they told Pena Nieto they did not have confidence in the investigation, and the government agreed to measures including the creation of a commission to monitor the case. 'We are not going to trust the words of the president nor the commitments that were made public ... until they present the 43 students to us alive,' Felipe de la Cruz, one of the parents, said at a news conference late Wednesday. At one point earlier in the day, human rights officials had said the meeting was over but the family members were refusing to leave until Pena Nieto signed a document that would satisfy everyone. Pena Nieto said in televised remarks that in addition to the commission, made up of both government officials and parents to provide daily updates on the investigation, the government agreed to provide greater support for both rural teachers colleges and the families of those who were killed or wounded in the attack, and to redouble efforts to determine the students' whereabouts. Soldiers of the Mexican Navy stand guard along a road near where a mass grave has been discovered in a trash dump outside the mountain town of Cocula during the probe into the missing students . 'There will be a renewed search plan,' Pena Nieto said. The relatives came to Mexico City from the Rural Normal School of Ayotzinapa in Guerrero state, where the missing students were enrolled. 'We are asking them to not just look for them in the graves, not just look for them in the dumps, because we are sure they are alive,' de la Cruz told reporters at a human rights center in the Mexican capital. Another father of a missing student, Rafael Lopez also expressed frustration at authorities' inability to determine what happened. A woman marches with leaflets with the images of the missing students  during a protest against their disappearance from the Isidro Burgos rural teachers college . People attend a protest at the Zocalo, Mexico City's main square, against the disappearance of the students . 'If they can't do it, they should ask for help from the United States,' Lopez said from the school, where he and some of the parents remained Wednesday. Iguala's former mayor and his wife are fugitives, and 56 people have been detained, including police from Iguala and the nearby town of Cocula as well as the alleged leader of Guerreros Unidos. Pena Nieto said the rule of law will apply regardless of 'wherever (the investigation) leads.' The case has spurred anger across the country, and large protest marches demanding action by the government have been held in Mexico City, Acapulco and the capital of Guerrero, Chilpancingo. Several protests have erupted in violence. On Wednesday, protesters aligned with the teachers college attended by the missing attacked the Guerrero governor's residence Chilpancingo, damaging the front gate and burning an official vehicle outside.","Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa reportedly behind 43 students disappearing .

"Just hours after his top secret summit with the next Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal in Holland, Ryan Giggs was back at Old Trafford to cast his eye over the club's next generation of talent. United's Class of '14 were in action against Chelsea in the final of the Under-21 Premier League, but Giggs's long day ended in disappointment as they went down 2-1. So what should Giggs report back to Van Gaal? Which young stars should he bring through into the first team fold and which need a little more time to develop? VIDEO Scroll down for a look at United youngsters Wilson and Keane . Plenty to ponder: Ryan Giggs watched Manchester United's Under-21 side in their final with Chelsea at Old Trafford, hours after meeting with Louis van Gaal in Holland . Dejection: The Man United players stand and watch as Chelsea lift the trophy following their 2-1 win in the Under-21 Premier League showpiece . Ben Amos (Goalkeeper) Aged 24, Amos was one of the permitted over-age players on show at Old Trafford and is already an understudy to David De Gea and Anders Lindegaard in the first team squad. He pulled off an outstanding save early on to push away a rasping shot from Chelsea's Lewis Baker but his positioning could have been better when Charly Musonda flashed in the equaliser on 22 minutes. De Gea isn't likely to be going anywhere soon and is actually younger than Amos. Needs to head off on loan again next season, like he did at Carlisle United in the first half of this campaign, otherwise he's going to be starved of match time. Understudy: Ben Amos is third-choice goalkeeper at United behind David De Gea and Anders Lindegaard . Guillermo Varela (Defender) An enterprising performance at right-back from the Uruguayan, who isn't shy in getting forward in support of the attack as is expected at United. Gave Adam Nditi all kinds of problems with his twisting runs and trickery during the first-half and was then pushed further forward. Deserves to be elevated to the first-team squad though and can provide competition for Rafael as his game becomes more mature. All action: Guillermo Varela hurdles the challenge of Chelsea's Charly Musonda during an energetic and enterprising performance . Patrick McNair (Defender) The centre-back only graduated to the Under-21 team during the latter part of the season and so isn't fully established at this standard. Like his fellow defenders, was a little stand-offish when Chelsea attacked with pace and perhaps could have done better in closing down Musonda and Baker for the two goals. Showed attacking credentials when nearly winning a penalty just before the interval. Will improve with another year at Under-21 level. Surrounded: Patrick McNair takes on Chelsea's Adam Nditi during the Old Trafford final . Michael Keane (Defender) An England Under-21 regular and fairly experienced after loan spells in the Championship with Leicester, Derby and Blackburn, it's a big year ahead for Keane. With the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic leaving a vacuum at the heart of United's defence, a few solid performances could propel him into the first team on a regular basis. Not the finished article, but there is a case for giving the 21-year-old an opportunity to prove himself. Reece James (Defender) Like Varela, showed a willingness to push forward on the left-side but also found himself pinned further back after half-time when United needed impetus. His loan spell at Carlisle early this season was blighted by a thigh injury, though he recovered to become an Under-21 regular after Christmas. Likely to be sent out on loan for experience again when the new season comes round. Replaced by Tyler Blackett after tiring late on. Hands on: United captain Reece James seen here challenging Liverpool's Joao Teixeira in the semi-final . Saidy Janko (Midfield) Probably United's greatest threat in the second half, Janko was prepared to run at the Chelsea defence and covered plenty of ground up and down the right touchline. At just 18, he has time on his side and will inevitably feature in more Under-21 matches for United next season. Giggs and van Gaal will keep an eye on his progress. Willing: Saidy Janko covered plenty of ground on the right flank as he tried to inspire United in attack . Charni Ekangamene (Midfield) The Belgian was up against two very talented Chelsea midfielders in Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Lewis Baker but wasn't fazed and showed a willingness to get stuck in. This was best demonstrated when he clattered Nathan Ake and earned a booking just before half-time. His season in the Under-21s was also punctuated by a spell at Carlisle, though he only got on the field four times. Another spell in the Football League seems likely next season. Sandwiched: Charni Ekangamene tries to manoeuvre between Nathan Ake and Ola Aina . Ben Pearson (Midfield) Oldham-born midfielder who has drawn inevitable comparisons with Paul Scholes. Featured heavily for the Under-21s and in the UEFA Youth League this season and put in a decent shift against Chelsea. Will continue with the Under-21s for another season and could be worth a look in the League Cup. On the move: Ben Parson leaves Adam Nditi flat on his back as he breaks forward . Andreas Pereira (Midfield) It was a disappointing night for Pereira as he struggled to inspire the United attack. He would have hoped to create a continuous stream of chances but openings proved few and far between, especially in the second-half. He is tipped for big things and is clearly capable, but he won't be stepping up to the first team anytime soon. Another year of experience for the 18-year-old in the youth competitions will increase his influence on games. Quiet night: Andreas Pereira was unable to provide forward thrust for United . Tom Lawrence (Forward) United's stand-out player in the first-half, especially with a nicely-taken goal early on, but lost his cutting edge after the break when often forced to take the Chelsea defence all by himself. When Lawrence turned his man to curl home United's goal on 12 minutes and when he marauded down the wing early on, you could have closed your eyes and imagined it was a young Ryan Giggs with the No 11 shirt on. Giggs would have been impressed watching on in the stands and will be willing to give him first team opportunities next season. Lawrence sadly wasn't able to maintain his performance after half-time and lost two one-on-one battles with the quick Ola Aina when he could have been clear. Was ultimately replaced by Josh Harrop and appeared to be carrying a knock. Did enough to impress though. On target: Tom Lawrence capped a good display with the opening goal, a well-taken curling effort . James Wilson (Forward) The 18-year-old lived out many a United fan's dream when he scored twice on debut against Hull City last week, but he was off the pace for the most part here as he struggled along while clearly carrying a hamstring injury. He showed good awareness to set up Lawrence for the goal but otherwise couldn't carve out any chances. In the end, he limped off for the lively James Weir with a quarter of the match left. Wilson will be in and around the first team next season having shown his potential already and could make an effective impact sub for Giggs and Van Gaal. Leading the line: James Wilson intercepts a pass from Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen .","Giggs watched Under-21 final defeat to Chelsea alongside Paul Scholes .

"A woman who claims she was the victim of an IRA cover-up after being raped by one of the terror group's commanders will have her case looked at again, prosecutors said today. Mairia Cahill, 33, claims the IRA conducted its own kangaroo court inquiry into her account before acquitting her alleged attacker. Sinn Fein chief Gerry Adams has denied Ms Cahill's allegations but admitted the IRA investigated sex abuse and paedophile claims and even killed abusers. Today's development comes after it emerged British secret services blackmailed former IRA chief of staff Joe Cahill - Ms Cahill's great uncle - to spy for them after he was allegedly caught abusing a 14-year-old girl. Scroll down for video . Republican: Cahill, left, was jailed for life for killing a policeman and later helped form the modern Provisional IRA. His niece Mairia, right, claims she was abused by a different IRA member but leadership including Gerry Adams tried her by kangaroo court . The man Ms Cahill has accused of raping her when she was just 16 was later acquitted of criminal charges in court after she withdrew her evidence. Charges were also dropped against those allegedly involved in the IRA's internal inquiry. Ms Cahill's story was highlighted in a BBC Spotlight documentary last week. Northern Ireland director of public prosecutions Barra McGrory announced that he was establishing an independent review of the 'prosecutorial systems and processes' in relation to three cases involving sex abuse and terrorist related charges connected to Ms Cahill's alleged rape. Yesterday the Daily Mirror claimed Mr Cahill - the IRA's former Chief of staff - was photographed by a covert unit in his car but never prosecuted -  instead he was convinced to share secrets about the IRA's leadership, it was claimed today. Cahill, who died in 2004 and whose coffin was carried by Gerry Adams and  Martin McGuinness, was considered one of Britain's 'prized assets' in Northern Ireland, it was alleged. As a member of the IRA's leadership Cahill would have had detailed knowledge about its bombing campaigns and would be involved in arming members and raising funding for terrorism. Turned? Former IRA Chief of Staff Joe Cahill, left with Gerry Adams, spied for the British after being caught abusing a 14-year-old, it was claimed today . Backer: Adams sits with Cahill at his book launch in Belfast in 2002, shortly before his death . A security services source has claimed Cahill was followed around Belfast by spies in the 1970s before he was caught abusing the 14-year-old child. Officers then turned him to spy for Britain during the Troubles. 'The pictures clearly identified both Cahill and his victim,' the source told the Daily Mirror. 'Her father would have killed him if he had found out. He was never prosecuted and instead the pictures were used to turn him. He was a prized asset.' Cahill was a founding commander of the modern Provisional IRA that killed nearly 1,800 people during a failed 1970-1997 campaign to force Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom. He himself was sentenced to death for killing a policeman in the 1940s, but this was changed to a life sentence after pressure from Britain by the Irish government and the Vatican. Tribute: Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness  carry Joe Cahill's coffin after he died in 2004, aged 84 . He served less than ten years before his release but jailed again during the IRA's Border Campaign of the 1950s. The new allegations about Cahill being a double agent means he may have been working for one of several secret services units working in Northern Ireland at the time. Members would spy on Republicans and female members were known to have sex with IRA members for information. Cahill's alleged role as a British agent was only known to a small number of people but an IRA source told the Mirror there were suspicions he was an informer. Last week Adams also faced new accusations that he concealed child-abuse crimes within his own secretive movement, this time allegedly committed by a Belfast officer of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. History: Joe Cahill (centre left) pictured as a wanted man at an IRA news conference in 1971. His press conference ended abruptly when guards posted on nearby street corners warned of approaching British Army patrols . Ms Cahill is a grand-niece of Joe Cahill, but she was not his victim. She received legal anonymity when she went to police with her accusations. In 2012 the man she accused of raping her, Martin Morris, was charged with IRA membership and 13 counts of sexual assault. He always denied her claims and was acquitted of all charges. Four others were charged with IRA membership based on Cahill's accusation that they interrogated her several times in 1999 and 2000 about her accusations against Morris, when the IRA attempted to determine whether Cahill or Morris was telling the truth. She said at one point the IRA forced her to confront Morris face to face. Prosecutors withdrew the case without explanation earlier this year. Cahill waived her anonymity in a BBC documentary broadcast last Tuesday, during which she accused Adams of telling her she might have enjoyed the abuse. Adams acknowledged meeting Cahill around that time, but rejected her account and denied knowing of any IRA inquiry into her case. Last year the paedophile brother of Gerry Adams was jailed for 16 years for raping his daughter. Liam Adams, 58, was found guilty  of a string of vile sexual assaults on his child Aine Dahlstrom when she was aged between four and nine in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The 40-year-old, who has waived her right to anonymity, wiped tears from her eyes as she watched him jailed.","Mairia Cahil accuses the IRA of protecting rapist who attacked her aged 16 .

"A seaside village once so famous for its oysters it was named after them is celebrating – now that the long-departed shellfish have returned. In Victorian times the fishing village of Oystermouth, which overlooks Swansea Bay, sold the delicacy at markets in London and across Europe. But the trade died out in the 1920s as pollution destroyed the oyster beds. The annual Mumbles Oyster and Seafood Festival which attracts 8,000 visitors each year welcomed the return of the delicacy . Oystermouth is celebrating - because the shellfish the village is named after have made a come back nearly a century after being wiped out . Experts have revealed oysters are now growing and breeding in the sea off Swansea Bay . Marine biologists released 40,000 oysters into the sea last winter in an attempt to repopulate the bay. The shellfish are now breeding, and experts hope that within five years the village's livelihood could be revived. Dr Andy Woolmer, who worked with Cambridge University on the project, said: 'The water is so much cleaner now and the oysters seem to be happy. 'Not only have the oysters survived the harsh winter last year, they also grew in size and, crucially, managed to spawn. 'Going forward, it means that the oysters we've put in represent a brood stock that could repopulate the bay. 'There is great potential for another wild fishery and that could happen in the next five years.' More than 18 million oysters were landed by the village’s fishermen in 1871 and sent by train to restaurants in London and cities around Europe . Marine biologists released 40,000 oysters into the sea last winter in an experiment to discover if the industry could be revived . The shellfish are sitting on 70-acres of sea bed an area about the size of 35 rugby pitches. The annual Mumbles Oyster and Seafood Festival which attracts 8,000 visitors each year welcomed the return of the delicacy. Festival organisers import 3,000 oysters from England each year but are now looking forward to serving up local oysters for the first time. Spokesman Paul Whittaker said: 'If we could farm the oysters in Swansea Bay it would support local businesses and local industries. 'It would also help us develop our past heritage, to increase the footfall of the area as a tourist destination.' Oystermouth councillor Tony Colburn said: 'Oyster fishing was extremely important in this area. Its oysters were world famous. 'But this is great news and we can live up to our proud name once again - the oyster is back in Oystermouth.'","The seaside village of Oystermouth, Swansea, has celebrated the return of oysters almost a century after the shellfish were wiped out .

"A tourist from New Zealand who has admitted to breaking a Buddha statue at Cambodia’s ancient Angkor Wat temple complex says it was fake and ‘didn’t belong’ there. Willemijn Vermaat, 40, told media in New Zealand that she did not intend to destroy the statue but ‘something strange happened to her’ and she heard voices when she visited the Bayon temple dedicated to Buddha. The Dutch woman, who has been living in Wellington for nearly a decade, claimed the 12th century temple belongs to a goddess named Inanna – not Buddha – and she was cleaning up rubbish to appease her. A Buddha statue sits at one of the entrances of Bayon temple at Angkor Wat, a Unesco World Heritage Site . The incident occurred after the complex, a Unesco World Heritage Site, had closed to visitors on the final night of her four-week holiday to Laos and Cambodia. She told Stuff.co.nz: ‘When I got in there I got a very strange feeling that something was talking to me, but it was like it was my own thoughts. ‘It was telling me I had to clean up the temple because there was too much rubbish, from the monks and other people.’ She was discovered by three monks but retreated into the jungle while authorities scoured the grounds for her. She eventually returned to the temple to meditate once the search ended. Angkor Wat contains Bayon temple (pictured) and remains of different capitals of the Khmer Empire . Ms Vermaat said: ‘I was told I had to move the Buddha but I said I didn't want to as it's such a great religion and nothing to make fun of. ‘So I tried to sit on his lap but that didn't work so I pushed him out, and I was apologising to him, but that must have been when I broke it.’ She said the voices went away after she stopped meditating. Ms Vermaat told APNZ: ‘That night some strange things happened and I don't know, maybe I can just bring it down to being possessed by something and although I still remember everything as well. I was aware but I wasn't completely the person in charge so to say.’ Willemijn Vermaat said she damaged the statue while she was cleaning up 'rubbish' in the temple . After she left the temple she was questioned by police and released even though she told them she had damaged the statue. By then she had already missed her evening flight to Bangkok. Police attempted to arrest her the following day for damaging the statue but she had already left the country. Officials temporarily closed the temple to tourists and transported the statue’s pieces to a museum to find out if it can be reassembled. Bayon temple is a shrine to the Buddha, decorated with dozens of stone faces and statues . Officials have taken the statue’s pieces to a museum to find out if it can be repaired . Authorities said the statue, dating from the reign of Jayavarman VII in the late 12th century, was restored in the 1980s after it was discovered in pieces. But other media suggested it was a replica. Ms Vermaat told Stuff.co.nz that she felt bad about breaking the statue but it should not have been on display in the first place. She said: ‘I decided to talk to the media as I think that is what [Inanna] wants, because she indicated it was her temple and not Buddha's because over time someone had changed it to be a Buddhist temple. ‘She wants it to become her temple again.’","Willemijn Vermaat says 'something strange happened to her' during her visit .

"Not content with carrying out an ingenious escape under the noses of their zookeepers, a pair of runaway monkeys is trying to break back in. Only this time the mischievous monkeys are attempting to find their way into people’s houses. The capuchin monkeys left staff at the South Lakes Safari Zoo red-faced over the weekend when they each managed to escape on subsequent days. Scroll down for video . One of the monkeys, who has escaped from the South Lakes Safari Zoo in Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria. A number of people have reported seeing the animals close to where the zoo is based . And now the primates have sparked a police search operation after they have been seen loitering in gardens and trying to make their way into families’ houses. Zookeepers have yet to track down the miniscule animals despite reported sightings across Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria, close to where the zoo is based. The monkeys, which are known for their cunning and intelligence, have even been spotted sitting nonchalantly outside pubs at night. While the animals do not provide an immediate risk, police said they may bite or scratch anybody who approaches them. While the animals do not provide an immediate risk to the public, police say they may bite or scratch anybody who approaches them . It is still unclear how the monkeys managed to escape from the zoo, which is home to more than 1,000 animals. A young female monkey was reported missing on Saturday and was shortly joined on the run by another monkey that escaped on Sunday. Pictures have appeared online showing the animals sitting on a garage and at the side of a road. But the zoo’s hopes of finding the monkeys will be buoyed by the success of a similar operation only four years ago. On that occasion a three-year-old capuchin called Tony went on the run for five days. He was eventually caught by the zoo’s owner David Gill wandering around in a local graveyard. The South Lakes Animal Park in Dalton-in-Furness in Cumbria, where the two monkeys escaped from . Capuchin monkeys are best known as the breed used by organ grinders. Their intelligence means that they can even be trained to perform household tasks and are often used in laboratories. The animals, which are only 40cm tall and weigh between 1.3 - 4kg, are native to South America – predominantly the Amazon rainforest. Donna Martin, who spotted the first escapee running along pavement in the town centre, said: ‘I was surprised and worried that it would get run over. ‘From a distance I thought it was a young cat as it was slim and moving quickly, but as I drove closer I realised that it wasn’t. I hope it gets back to the zoo OK.’ A spokesman for Cumbria police said: ‘Police were called today at 9.11am with confirmation that a second monkey has escaped.

Animal keeper Sarah McClay, 24, was mauled to death by a tiger that had access to a restricted corridor in which she was standing. She had been working in the supposedly safe keeper’s corridor, from which she could access the tiger pens through metal doors, which were bolted shut.

"Aldi are introducing £9.99 caviar to target their upmarket rivals such as Waitrose . Caviar has always been associated with the high life. But now the unlikeliest supermarket is to stock the luxury item on its shelves in the run up to Christmas. Discounter Aldi, better known for selling potatoes at a bargain basement 69p a kilo, is to sell Beluga caviar costing £9.99 per 20 grams. The move is part of a plan to step up its battle for a bigger slice of the luxury market as it takes on upmarket rivals such as Waitrose by increasing and improving its selection of goods aimed at affluent consumers. It comes as plans to open 65 new stores across the country were announced, with the company's sales soaring by 30 per cent to more than £5billion in 2013. The change in produce is particularly noticeable in the German-owned chain’s Christmas range. It will sell fresh scallops for the first time at £4.99 per 240 grams, and fresh dressed crab at £3.99 for two. There will also be a whole goose at £35.99 as well as a five bird roast (Turkey, Goose, Duck, Pheasant, Chicken, wrapped in bacon ) at £9.99. Many of these items tend to be in short supply which critics say Aldi uses to lure shoppers through its doors. Scroll down for video . Joint managing directors of Aldi, Matthew Barnes (left) and Roman Heini (right) These new items are in addition to the fresh lobster at £9.99 per 240g first stocked last Christmas, and whole legs of Spanish serrano ham for £44.99 for 6.5kg which are being stocked again this year. Aldi made its name with cut-price own-brand household products but now offers a range of upmarket coffees, steaks, olive oils and wine, as well as award-winning champagne and gin. Its premium range of products saw sales grow 74 per cent as it attracts more middle class shoppers. It’s success has seen soaring profits and sales as it gains market share from rivals such as troubled Tesco, and Sainsbury’s. Figures released today show Aldi has beaten all of the big Four Grocers in terms of the rate it is growing profits. Pre-tax profit jumped 65.2 per cent to £260.9million for the year to December 31, 2013 from £157.9million. Aldi opened 42 new stores last year and is on course to open 54 this year, with another 60-65 new stores planned to open in 2015. This will take total UK store numbers to over 600, keeping it on course to have 1,000 by 2022. It recruited 9,000 new members of staff in the UK in 2013, including more than 291 apprentices and 165 graduates. 'The company expects to have more than 7,000 new workers in 2014, including 500 in apprenticeships and 160 in graduate positions. Aldi made its name with cut-price own-brand household products but now offers a range of upmarket coffees, steaks, olive oils and wine, as well as award-winning champagne and gin . Mr Barnes said: 'In addition to new store openings, we’ll be upgrading existing stores to meet customer demand. 'We’re investing over £600 million in our operations over the next two years to support this growth. 'This means we can grow while always giving customers the service, value and award-winning quality they expect at Aldi.' The Aldi group now has more than 7,000 stores across three continents. Aldi's history began in a small grocer's shop in the mining town of Essen in Germany opened in 1914 by Anna Albrecht, . By 1948, her sons Karl and Theo had taken it to four other locations in the country, and in 1954, the first self-service shop was opened. The brothers had a falling out in 1960 over whether or not to sell cigarettes in stores, and the brand was split into Aldi Nord and Aldi Sud. In 1971, Theo Albrecht was kidnapped for 17 days and held to a ransom of $3million. The Albrecht family has remained notoriously private since. Karl Albrecht is now in his nineties and was listed Germany's richest man by Forbes last year. The brand's name is a combination of the family's and the word discount. After branches were opened in America, the first store in Britain welcomed shoppers in 1990. It now has more than 500 across the world. Despite the encouraging figures, the chain is suffering along with many of its rivals from the price war it sparked. Its profit growth is half the 123.9 per cent it achieved in 2012. This is because Aldi has also been forced to slash its prices to keep ahead of the supermarkets, such as Tesco and Morrisons, which joined it in dropping prices. Matthew Barnes, Aldi’s joint managing director, said: ‘We are delighted with the 65 per cent growth but yes it is a reduction. We continue to reduce profit margins by investing in sharper prices, but this is more than offset by our economies of scale. ‘We invest in prices to maintain the [price] gap which will have a short term impact on the bottom line. We will remain the price leader. We have reduced them [prices] in line with the market – we won’t let them [rival supermarkets] close the gap on Aldi.’ The drop in price has boosted the number of customers more than one million more than this time last year, increasing total sales for the group by 35.7 per cent to £5.2billion from £3.8billion. However this too is slower growth than the 40.6 per cent seen the previous year. The fact that Aldi is also seeing something of a slowdown is a sign of just how tough it is for the grocers at the moment. New data out last week showed that overall grocery market growth slowed to a  record low of 0.3 per cent as the average basket of everyday goods bought today cost exactly the same as it did a year ago. Barnes said: ‘It is a tough market out there, spending is going backwards on groceries.’ Aldi is testing a new larger store format at 1,254 square metres and plans to increase its store numbers from 530 to 1,000  by 2021, employing 50,000 staff.","Budget chain is to start selling Beluga caviar in the run up to Christmas .

"Jack Wilshere rarely shirks a tackle. Just ask Paul Scholes or Daniel Agger or Wilshere’s doctor. He knows only one way, it is in his nature and that is not about to change, even if his stomach lurched and he feared for his World Cup dream when he picked up his phone in March and saw messages backing up from the medical experts. The injury had not seemed too serious at the time. There was no great pain, he played on for 40 minutes and there was nothing alarming on the post-match scans, but there was a threat of deja vu in the air. VIDEO: Scroll down for Jack Wilshere takes on pinball machine in latest Nike advert . Back in action: Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere (left) controls the ball during training on Wednesday . Taking a tumble: Wilshere gets brought down by a tackle from team-mate Aaron Ramsey . In the frame: Wilshere could start Saturday's FA Cup final with Hull after returning to full training . legend: Wilshere thinks Paul Scholes is the greatest English midfielder of all time . Three years ago, Wilshere hobbled out of Wembley after an England game with a sore ankle and did not play another competitive match for 17 months. This time, he feared a place in England’s World Cup squad might be in jeopardy when a closer  inspection found a crunching challenge with Agger during an international friendly against  Denmark had caused a hairline fracture in his left foot. ‘The tackle was probably 70-30 in his favour, but I still went into it,’ said Wilshere. ‘That’s me. I can’t change that because it’s a big part of my game. The manager at  Arsenal has always said to me it’s important not to lose that bite. ‘When I first did it, I thought, “Oh no”, but then as I walked off it felt easier and I carried on. After the game, I had a scan straight away and it didn’t show anything. I had to go to someone who specialises in reading scans to see it. ‘Next day, I woke up and had about six missed calls from the doctor, so I went to see the specialist who looked after my right ankle and he said it would take six weeks. ‘It took a few days to get my head round it. I’ve been in that  position before, so I know what it takes — a lot of work in the gym, on the bike, to keep up fitness levels.’ Wilshere returned as a sub at Norwich on Sunday in Arsenal’s final game of the Barclays Premier League season. He is now in contention for Saturday’s FA Cup final against Hull City and made the cut for Roy Hodgson’s 23-man England World Cup squad. Ouch: Wilshere broke a bone in his foot in this challenge with Denmark's Daniel Agger in March . He's back: Wilshere returned from injury in Arsenal's 2-0 win at Norwich on Sunday . If anyone deserves a break, it is the 22-year-old midfielder earmarked by former England boss Fabio Capello and international skipper Steven Gerrard as a future captain of his country. ‘There’s a few ahead of me,’ said Wilshere. ‘There’s Rooney and Joe Hart. They’re where I want to be. They’ve got experience and won all those caps. People say this is  Gerrard’s last World Cup, am I going to be England’s next captain? No, I’m not. ‘First, I’d like to be captain of my club. The most important thing for me is to get those caps, have a full season without any injuries and just prove myself.’ Without question, injuries have slowed Wilshere. He has won 15 England caps since Capello handed him a debut four years ago but progress has been so painful at times that some have wondered if the young midfielder will ever be the player he promised to be as a teenager. Brazil bound: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger believes Wilshere will be match fit for the World Cup . Scholes touched this issue while working as a TV pundit for the Manchester derby. The former England midfielder  said Wilshere had not improved in five years — a harsh assessment which stunned the Arsenal player. ‘It was out of the blue,’ said Wilshere. ‘He was having a go at Arsenal, and I was wondering if he was going to come for me. If it had come from a rubbish player I could say, “What are you talking about?” but it came from Paul Scholes. For me, he’s the best English midfielder of all time.’ Just as he proved unable to resist the tackle with Agger, he went after Scholes. ‘Go easy on him,’ said England coach Gary Neville as he passed Wilshere a phone number for his former Manchester United team-mate. Wise words: Wilshere had a discussion with Scholes (centre) after the former midfielder criticised him . Getting stuck in: Wilshere says his injury problems won't affect his physical style on the pitch . Honest: Scholes didn't hold back when discussing Wilshere's progress at Arsenal during a TV appearance . ‘I wanted to get to the bottom of it,’ said Wilshere. ‘I just wanted to hear what he thinks. I respect him so much. We had quite a good chat. He’s entitled to his opinion. He explained it a bit better and told me what I should work on. ‘He was right in a certain way. I can’t keep saying I’ve been injured a lot. There comes a time when you stop being a kid and I think that’s what he’s referring to. This season I’ve improved a lot, scored a few more; got a few more assists. ‘It’s those stats that  matter. That’s what I have to build on.’ The other angle of that Scholes critique was aimed at the lack of leadership in Arsene Wenger’s Arsenal. Again, it is a moot point for Wilshere as the FA Cup final approaches and Arsenal seek to end nine years without a trophy. Relaxed: Wilshere (centre) shares a joke with team-mate Laurent Koscielny (left) in training . ‘I’m young but I’ve been around the first team for a while,’ said Wilshere. ‘I’d like to think of myself as a leader and I like to think the manager thinks of me as a leader. ‘We’ve been here before in the Carling Cup (losing 2-1 to Birmingham City in the 2011 final). No disrespect to the Carling Cup, but this is bigger. ‘You remember the FA Cup finals. It’s right that we go on and win this. We don’t have to prove we have leaders to win this. We just have to win it.’","Wilshere called Scholes after the former Manchester United midfielder criticised his progress .

Pro-democracy protesters sleep in a supply tent near the government's headquarters and some have vowed to remain there until negotiations are finalised .

Some barricades blocking the government building's entrance were removed after officials told protesters they would do whatever was necessary to ensure 3,000 civil servants would have full access to their offices today. About 25 protesters, mostly students, refused to budge from the site, and some plan to stay there for as long as they can. They have vowed to refuse to engage with the government if force is used to move them.

Police spokesman Steve Hui said: 'To restore order, we are determined, and we are confident we have the capability to take any necessary action. He added: 'There should not be any unreasonable, unnecessary obstruction by any members of the public.' Parts of a main thoroughfare through the heart of the business district remain closed, but schools today reopened. Student demonstrators say they have taken early steps to begin talks with the government on their demands for wider political reforms, but actual negotiations have not started. Tens of thousands of people, many of them students, have poured into the streets as part of the protests that began on September 28 to peacefully protest China's restrictions on the first direct election for Hong Kong's leader, promised by Beijing for 2017. The protests are the strongest challenge to authorities in Beijing since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China has promised that Hong Kong can have universal suffrage by 2017, but it says a committee of mostly pro-Beijing figures must screen candidates for the top job. The protesters are also demanding the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, the city's current leader, but he has refused to step down. Protests continue outside his offices. Some activists disagree with the partial withdrawal at government headquarters, and an alliance of students say they will keep up their protests until talks are scheduled . Protesters littered the streets outside the office of Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, the city's current leader, who they have called on to step down . Some activists disagree with the partial withdrawal at government headquarters, and an alliance of students say they will keep up their protests until details of the talks are worked out. Alex Chow, a student leader, said he was not worried about the crowd dwindling. He said: 'Because people need rest, but they will come out again. It doesn't mean the movement is diminishing. Many people still support it.' But Louis Chan, who still plans to stay at the government headquarters for 'as long as he can', is not sure achieving universal suffrage - the students' original goal - is now likely. He said: 'I think it was possible, but now I don't think so because they (the Hong Kong government) don't give any response and China is also very much against this.' Police said they had arrested 30 people since the start of the protests. Protesters, meanwhile, complained the police were failing to protect them from attacks by mobs intent on driving them away. Meanwhile, former Hong Kong chief secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang has slammed the British government’s 'profoundly disappointing responses' to the protests. Writing in the Guardian newspaper, Ms Chan, now head of the pro-democracy think tank Hong Kong 2020, states that the UK has 'a moral and legal responsibility to Hong Kong'. She said: 'It did after all sign a treaty, back in 1984, that guaranteed Hong Kong’s core values and way of life, including freedom of speech and assembly, until 2047.' Ms Chan goes on to comment Britain’s reluctance to risk a stand-off with Beijing: 'Their first instinct is to keep their heads low; they just want things to carry on as before, would like the protests to disappear, and maintain good relations with China.'","Protesters defy deadline to leave the streets and some 25 remain outside the Hong Kong government's headquarters .

"A second woman has revealed her identity claiming she was abused by former CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi. Author and lawyer Reva Seth says she met Ghomeshi in 2002 as a 26-year-old after starting a new job in Toronto, Canada. She claims the pair 'kissed' a few times before the 47-year-old became 'a different person, super angry, almost frenzied and disassociated'. Reva Seth (pictured right) says she met Jian Ghomeshi (left) in 2002 as a 26-year-old after starting a new job in Toronto, Canada . The founder of radio show Q was fired from the program on Sunday, amid accusations of sexual assault, which he claimed were started by a jilted ex-girlfriend looking for revenge. His lawyers have allegedly moved to sue the public-funded broadcasting company for $55million, claiming he was fired over a 'moral judgement' of his BDSM lifestyle. But Seth has gone public to describe her allegations against him - claiming he once 'had his hand around my throat' before abusing her. The mother-of-three, who wrote the book 'MomShift', wrote an account of her alleged abuse in a blog published by The Huffington Post Canada. So far, nine women have come forward to claim Ghomeshi slapped, choked and verbally assaulted them on dates and at work in the past 12 years. Actress Lucy DeCoutere, who stars on the television show Trailer Park Boys, was the first of those to identify herself. Others have decided to remain anonymous, fearing  online bullying. Seth described in the blog how Ghomeshi was 'funny and charming,' when the pair first started seeing each other casually. But one evening, she claims, his behaviour suddenly changed. Actress Lucy DeCoutere (left), who appears on television show Trailer Park Boys, is one of nine women who have come forward with claims about fired-CBC radio host Jian Ghomeshi (right) She wrote: 'When it was over, I got up and it was clear I was really angry. My sexual interactions until then had always been consensual, enjoyable and fun. 'He gave me some weird lines about how he couldn’t tell if I was actually attracted to him or not. And somehow this was meant to explain his behaviour.' Afterwards she decided not to involve the police and opted not to come forward fearing the impact of online trolls. But she eventually decided to reveal her identity after hearing Lucy DeCoutere speaking on CBC about her 'remarkably similar experience'. Yesterday, Ghomeshi issued a short statement thanking his Facebook followers for their support and saying he would not be discussing the matter further with the media. DeCoutere says she first met Ghomeshi at a barbecue in Banff, Canada, in 2003, and that they later met up in Toronto to have dinner. She says throughout the meal, Ghomeshi went on about how famous he was and 'how lucky you are to be with me'. After dinner, they went back to Ghomeshi's house where they began making out. But things soon turned violent when she claims Ghomeshi pushed her against a wall, choked her and slapped her three times. 'He did not ask if I was into it. It was never a question. It was shocking to me. The men I have spent time with are loving people,' said DeCoutere, who also works as a captain in the Royal Canadian Air Force when she is not acting. DeCoutere promptly left in a taxi. The Star goes on to detail each account from the other seven victims, which occurred as early as 2002 and as recently as 2013. Fired: Ghomeshi was fired from his radio show Q on Sunday amid allegations of sexual assault. He says he was wrongly terminated after executives found out about his BDSM lifestyle. Nine women are saying their sexual encounters with Ghomeshi were not consensual . Three of the women met Ghomeshi in 2012, when he was touring the country to support his autobiography, and two of the women are co-workers. One of the women says she was in a work meeting with Ghomeshi when they were left alone in a room and he leaned over to say: 'I want to hate f*** you'. While the woman claims to have reported Ghomeshi's inappropriate behavior, including a time when he grabbed her buttocks, to her union supervisor, she doesn't believe the host was ever punished. The CBC says it is now investigating the incident. Another CBC producer says she met Ghomeshi during his book tour and that she was attacked by him in a hotel room. She didn't report the incident because she 'felt like Jian was a CBC god'. Two of the women also told the story of Big Ears Teddy, a stuffed animal that played a role in their sexual encounters with Ghomeshi. One woman who was invited over to Ghomeshi's house says he turned the teddy bear to face away from the bed saying: 'Big Ears Teddy shouldn't see this'. On Sunday, the CBC announced that Ghomeshi would no longer be working for the network in a vague statement saying recently-revealed information 'precludes us from continuing our relationship'. Following that announcement, the Toronto Star published their first article with four accounts from alleged victims. The ninth anonymous woman met him at a Christmas media party more than a decade ago. She described the radio show host and musician as 'smitten' with her and she in turn said she was charmed by his charismatic personality. Their first date was to watch him tape his own show and they socialized with his colleagues and then went to a bar afterwards to talk. She said he was only charming and gave her no reason at all to worry. He drove her home and while in the car on the way to hers he came on to her and asked her if she would undo her blouse buttons, she claims. She said 'no' at which point, the woman alleges, Ghomeshi reached over and grabbed her hair and pulled her head back. He then allegedly said something like 'how do you like that?' The woman then said she asked him to stop and she got out of the car. The woman though, told CBC that she agreed to see him again, because she thought he 'might just have been too rough' - but nothing that couldn't be ironed out. Two of the women also told the story of Big Ears Teddy, a stuffed animal that played a role in their sexual encounters with Ghomeshi . On the second date, she brought a friend along but then at the end of the evening went back to his house. The two got friendly back at his and during a clinch she alleges that he pulled her hair again, this time only harder and then began to punch her on the ears till she cried. The anonymous woman then fled his home and went to a friends house and cried throughout the night. When asked why she didn't press charges or call the police, the woman said she only wanted to curl up in a corner. She said she was so shocked by the seemingly charming man's violence that it left her feeling only shock - but now she wishes she had gone to the police. Ghomeshi responded to his dismissal by writing a Facebook post claiming a spurned ex-girlfriend started spreading sexual assault rumors. In the post, Ghomeshi speaks about his sexual preferences saying: 'I have always been interested in a variety of activities in the bedroom but I only participate in sexual practices that are mutually agreed upon, consensual, and exciting for both partners.' Ghomeshi goes on to say that he revealed all of this to his employers in an attempt to be transparent about the allegations, in case the story was ever published. He says last week he gave the network 'proof' that the sexual relationship was consensual, and that while his employers believed him they decided to terminate his contract, afraid that if his sexual life became public, it would cause a scandal. 'CBC execs confirmed that the information provided showed that there was consent. In fact, they later said to me and my team that there is no question in their minds that there has always been consent. They said they’re not concerned about the legal side. 'But then they said that this type of sexual behavior was unbecoming of a prominent host on the CBC. They said that I was being dismissed for ""the risk of the perception that may come from a story that could come out."" To recap, I am being fired in my prime from the show I love and built and threw myself into for years because of what I do in my private life.' Ghomeshi has been at the CBC for 14 years, and has been the host of the popular radio show Q, which he founded, since 2007. Recent interviews include Lena Dunham, Jamie Oliver and Ethan Hawke.","Jian Ghomeshi fired from his CBC radio show Q amid sexual assault claims .

"A Manhattan restaurant believes it may be the basis of one America's most famous paintings.

Owner Fiko Uslu started to research the claim and now believes it to be true. 'I am sure [this is the setting for ‘Nighthawks’],' he says. He bases the claim on the similarity between the building and the one in the painting which both feature triangular spaces and large windows.

Vigor says the bar inside has been there since the 1940s. However he has not been able to find out what the building housed in the early 40s, confirming only that the space has hosed a funeral parlor, restaurants, and even a porn store. But historians aren't convinced. Many researchers believe the painting is based on a spot on Mulry Square. Hopper passed away in 1967 and left only the clue that the painting 'was suggested by a restaurant on Greenwich Avenue where two streets meet.'

It's also possible that Hopper only imagined the diner rather than paint an existing structure. One person who's seen all the evidence he needs to see is the restaurant's landlord. He's already raising the rent based on the connection.","West Village's Classic's Cafe owners are so certain of the connection they're changing the name from Classic's Cafe to Nighthawks .

"You could be the new owner of a £1m hotel for just £1,000, if you're prepared to take a bit of a gamble. A hotelier couple are giving away their 14-bedroom Essex resort in a prize draw after running the business for 18 years. Owners Gordon and Blossom Hoyles and the Hotel Continental, in Dovercourt, appeared on Channel 4 show Four In A Bed in 2012, raising eyebrows at the time for their taste in erotic art. Yours for a grand: The owners of Hotel Continental in Dovercourt, Essex, are giving away the hotel in a prize draw - tickets cost £1,000 . While terms and conditions are still being ironed out, it will cost £1,000 for a ticket to be entered into the prize draw. The decision to sell the property in such an unusual way came in an early morning burst of inspiration after the couple were told that it would take two years to sell the property in the current market. 'One morning I woke up at 3.30am, went to the bar and said to our night porter I would raffle the hotel,' 78-year-old Mr Hoyles said. 'I started to look into it and found we could do it as a prize draw. We got a solicitor and started putting it together. TV stars: Gordon and Blossom Hoyles appeared on Channel 4 show Four in a Bed in 2012 . 'Blossom and I think it's time for a change. I haven't got that much time to spare and I don't want to be arguing over conveyancing trifles at 80 plus. 'Going might be a bit traumatic - a bit painful, but having decided to go we want to go quickly. 'It seems a good thing to give the winner an instant, exciting, life-changing, lucky day.' Gordon and Blossom showed off the Hotel Continental on Four In A Bed two years ago. The show sees hoteliers spend a night in a rival B&Bs, paying how much they believe the room is worth. Every room is described k as 'unique and deliberately different', with prices starting at £35 a night. The Dry Dock room looks like a ship's cabin with a stained glass porthole design window. Room eight is described as: 'A bit refined, a bit masculine. Sturdy oak.' There is also a family room with a double bed and bunk beds. Some rooms are decorated with racy wallpaper, unusual artwork and bespoke furniture. The hotel, which overlooks Dovercourt Bay, has a bar, 24-cover restaurant and terrace garden. The Hoyles hope the tickets could start being sold within a month. New business venture? Rooms start from £35 a night at the 14-bedroom hotel . It is still being discussed whether there will need to be a minimum number of tickets sold for the sale to go ahead. However, it cannot be called a lottery or a raffle as a lottery cannot be held for private financial gain and raffles have a prize limit so both would be illegal. Gordon and Blossom hope to visit Mr Hoyles' daughter in Australia, take a well-earned holiday and possibly move to France. Mr Hoyles said: 'We work 15 to 18 hour days so it would be nice to retire or have another business that isn't quite so hectic.' Budget: Accommodation ranges from large family suites to basic singles .","Punters can buy a £1,000 ticket to be entered into prize draw .

"There are no doubt many people who are better qualified than Larry Lamb to present a programme on the rise of the Roman Empire but you can see why Channel 5 producers chose the former Eastenders star to front their latest venture: his enthusiasm is infectious, and his name is likely to get people tuning in to catch the actor’s take on this fascinating period of history. Plus, the subject matter is a soap writer’s dream: there is political backstabbing, kidnapping and murder from the off. The four-part series Rome: The World’s First Superpower sees the Gavin and Stacey star chart the rise of the city from a collection of mud huts to a republic and a mighty empire spanning from Britain to the Middle East. Seeing the sights: A trip to Rome wouldn't be complete without a visit to the famous  Colosseum . Bringing history to life: The Roman Forum was the site of some of ancient Rome's most important buildings . Lamb is a self-confessed Roman history geek (at one point he tells viewers ‘I feel like a kid at Christmas’) and jumped at the chance to present the programme: ‘They wanted the person that presented this story to do it from the point of view of an interested history buff rather than an expert’, he explains. ‘What we’re doing is opening up the story in a way that people can understand the way it all came about. It’s the story of the birth of a superpower - it’s all about how a bunch of Bronze Age people living in little huts eventually finished up creating a civilisation the echoes of which have lasted for two and a half thousand years.’ The series opens with Rome’s 2,767th birthday celebrations in April. Gladiators, centurions, senators and Vestal Virgins stream past the camera during the procession which this year coincided with Easter: a time when thousands of people flood into the city. ‘Rome’s birthday is on a certain date whereas Easter can change by as much as a month’, Lamb explains. ‘We had to deal with an incredible number of tourists. Unless you are a Catholic and you want to go there with hundreds of thousands of people, I would really avoid Easter time. You’re going to be there with thousands of tourists anyway, but when you go there [at Easter], you’re going to have double the amount of tourists. They flock in from all over Italy.’ The parade, he says, is wonderful but warns: ‘If it’s colliding with Easter, I’d leave it to the next year.’ Big draw: Rome’s birthday procession includes gladiators, centurions, senators and Vestal Virgins . Keen student: Lamb also visited The British School at Rome to find out more about the Republic . Lamb plays the role of interested history student, frequently consulting a little red book that he carries around in his satchel, which contains Roman historian Livy’s account of the birth of Rome, written 700 years after the event. The finer points are explained with the help of leading historians and the archaeological sites are brought to life with the use of CGI. At Circus Maximus, Larry reveals more about Romulus and Remus’s deadly struggle to create a city, and discovers what the earliest settling would have looked like. He then jumps forward a couple of hundred years at the Capitoline Museum to explain how Tarquin the Proud, Rome’s seventh king, was ousted and the Republic was born. There is also a rare opportunity to descend into Rome’s claustrophobic ancient sewer network, parts of which date back to the 6th century BC and are still in use today. This elicits further ‘kid at Christmas time’ enthusiasm from Lamb but he reminds viewers that the complex network of tunnels was built at a terrible cost: enemy soldiers captured on the battlefield were forced to work as slaves on the construction. Many died and some even committed suicide rather than continue to work on the project. The sewers are, of course, not on the tourist map and Lamb is aware how privileged he was: ‘I spoke to a lot of archaeologists who were really jealous of the fact that I’d been down there.’ Annual pilgrimage: Thousands of tourists flock to St Peter's Basilica at Easter . Famous ruins: Larry visited Pompeii to find out more about the divide between patricians and plebeians . Travelling with a camera crew opens lots of doors but Larry could not escape Italy’s infamous red tape and had to be accompanied by professional guides at all times: ‘Filming anything in Rome is a big earner for the city and you have got to have permits for everything’, he explains. ‘If you get out of that van with a camera there will be a policeman asking where your permit is. So you need a professional ‘fixer’ to ensure you can do what you need to do.’ The money raised contributes to the cost of maintaining the archaeological sites that Lamb visited, many of which are ‘kind of just left hanging there’: ‘They are desperate to get money for companies like Channel 5 to film there because it helps them to put money in the kitty to open up more stuff. 'And, not only that, all these things that have been exposed have got to be maintained and it costs a fortune to keep these sites safe and out of danger of being ruined by the weather.’ Getting the expert's opinion: Larry (right) with British historian Dr Richard Miles . Wave of democracy: Larry found people in Tunisia to be 'much cooler' since the revolution . Later episodes will see Lamb travel to Jersey, where 70,000 Roman coins were found in a farmer’s field, and to Sicily and Tunisia where the Romans fought the Carthaginians and general Hannibal. Lamb last visited Tunisia in 2004 but says he felt much more relaxed on his return: ‘Since they had their revolution there it is a lot nicer place to be’, he explains. ‘People are much cooler. They’ve had this extraordinary wave of democracy. There are still a lot of police on the streets but you feel a lot more at ease walking around in Tunis now.’ The actor also got to film in parts of France that he’d never visited before, including Dijon which he found to be a ‘glorious, glorious city’. And heading to some of Italy’s more provincial cities helped him to see another side to the country: ‘I often say to people, if you’re coming to Britain, London is an extraordinary city but if you want to get a real taste of Britain you’re actually much better off going to a provincial city like Bristol, for example. So we went off to those sort of equivalent places: Bologna, Cremona, Rimini, Pompeii. ‘It’s going to those places and staying in funny little hotels - nothing fancy - that gives you a real taste of what the country is like. Not being on the tourist trail as it were. That was the great thing about it - we were going to places where there weren't any tourists and I think that’s what people don’t do enough. I think people are a little bit lacking on the sense of adventure.’ Setting the stage: The ruins of a Roman theatre in the old harbour city of Ostia, just outside of Rome . But Rome remains a big draw for Lamb - he tries to visit at least once a year – and he says the series has shown him the city in a ‘way I only ever dreamed of’. His tip for visitors is to explore on foot: ‘I love to walk around some of the little old quarters, tiny little winding roads and back ways where you get a sense that you are in an ancient city. And I could walk along the river for hours.’ He also recommends visiting the National Roman Museum, near Termini station, which houses one of the world’s most important collections of Classical art and is often overlooked by tourists. Those who want to explore a little further should take a train or a bus to the old harbour city of Ostia: ‘It’s incredible out there - the ruins are amazing. You can wander around for hours and there are not so many tourists.’ And does he now feel that he has covered everything The Eternal City has to offer? ‘No, there’s too much too see. I want to go back to Rome in the winter time. My Roman friends moan about it being too cold but I’ve been to the south in the winter time where they moan about it being too cold and for me it’s like a summer’s day. People are walking along the beach thinking: ‘There’s a mad person in the sea!’’ Rome: The World’s First Superpower is on Fridays at 8pm on Channel 5 .

"Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman said she wanted to run away to the Americas and become a waitress after her win at the 2000 Sydney Olympics because the media scrutiny got too much for her. Freeman also revealed she wanted to run away to the circus in a Living Black interview on SBS airing on Monday night as well as the influence her sister had on her career, the racism she faced as an indigenous athlete and her drive to win gold. The athlete said she had 'seriously' considered moving to Central or South America to escape the growing attention that surrounded her after her iconic gold medal win in the 400m event in 2000, The Daily Telegraph reported. Scroll down for video . Cathy Freeman after her 400m event win at the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000 . 'I had experience playing a big fat red kangaroo in Circus Oz and I wanted to join the circus because I wanted to just have fun,' the 41-year-old told Living Black host Karla Grant. Despite her collected exterior during the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony, Freeman said she felt she had to win gold as there was 'no other option' for her and was definitely feeling the weight of that expectation on her shoulders. The Olympian also told of the time following her 1994 gold medal win at the Commonwealth Games when she was going to give up athletics. But it was not just her struggles with new-found fame that Freeman battled. Freeman revealed she was feeling the pressure of winning gold at the 2000 Olympic Games despite her calm exterior during the lighting of the Olympic torch . During the interview, she spoke candidly about racism and it was directed at her from as early as her time at primary school in Mackay - in Queensland's far north. Freeman said she would watch trophies of the non-indigenous girls pile up as she went unrecognised. 'I think at the time I didn't really know what was going on,' she told SBS. 'Goodness gracious I didn't really need to get a gold medal or a trophy because to me, all that mattered was that I crossed the line first.' Smiling at the camera, Freeman shows off her gold medal at the Sydney Olympics . Freeman said what had upset her most about being denied her accolades was the negative reaction from her parents who 'were more upset' than her. The racism continued throughout her career, coming from fellow athletes to receiving hate mail from the public. But Freeman always rose above it, saying: 'I was never ever going to let it compromise my focus because in order to let that stuff into my mind…. it was going to distract me.' Freeman's former training partner Nova Peris - who is now a Northern Territory senator - described their experience of receiving hate mail as unpleasant and labelled it 'absolutely disgusting'. The person who had the biggest influence on Freeman's career was her sister, Anne-Marie, who died in 1990 after suffering an asthma attack - just three days after the Olympian won her first gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand. She said Anne-Marie was 'the most special and probably the most significant source of inspiration' for her. 'Just purely based on what she taught me in terms of the kind of person who I wanted to be,' Freeman said. 'Even though she might not be alive today, in my heart and in my mind she’s very much alive.'","Cathy Freeman won gold medal at 400m event at 2000 Sydney Olympics .

"More than 150,000 Lynda Bellingham fans have a joined a campaign to bring back her classic Oxo TV advert - to pay tribute to her wish for one last family Christmas. The stock cube firm is considering whether to run the 1984 clip My Christmas on December 25 in memory of the actress, whose death prompted an outpouring of tributes  last week. In her final TV interview she told of her excitement at spending her last Christmas with her family - ditching the apron of her screen appearances for a napkin in a nearby hotel. Scroll down for video . Final Christmas: Oxo is 'reviewing' whether to air the 1984 TV advert My Christmas (pictured) in memory of the late actress Lynda Bellingham, who played the much-loved mother of the family for more than 15 years . Beloved: A spokesman for Oxo said no decision had been made yet after a campaign by 150,000 fans . 'I've succumbed to not cooking it and I thought poor Michael [her husband], we can't put him through that again,' she told ITV's Loose Women. 'So we're going to go to a hotel for the meal, but just my little bit of control, we're going to go home for pudding and presents.' The Facebook campaign group, set up after the actress lost her battle with colon cancer, was called 'Bring back the Oxo Christmas advert in memory of Lynda Bellingham' and has gained more than 150,000 fans. Some fans of the 66-year-old actress have called on ITV to screen the advert free of charge while others have taking to donating to Cancer Research UK in her memory. One, Anne Sheridan, wrote: 'Let Linda have her Christmas. She will always be the Oxo mum xxx'. Stresses and strains: The actress played a mother dealing with all the noise and chaos of a family Christmas . Another, Jan Fravigar, added: 'It would be lovely, but what about her family how would they feel seeing her at Christmas, for me would be very hard.' A spokesman for Premier Foods, which runs the Oxo brand, said it was a 'highly sensitive issue' and the firm is 'reviewing the situation'. 'No decision has been made yet,' he said. Brave face: In her final TV interview the actress said she was looking forward to a family Christmas . The spokesman explained: 'Lynda was a fabulous actress with a career spanning many years. 'She will always be remembered as the OXO mum but we don't wish to overshadow all the other inspiring things she did with her life and career by focusing solely on our adverts. 'For the past two years we have partnered with MacMillan Cancer Support, one of the charities supported by Lynda, to raise more than £250,000 to help families affected by cancer and we will continue to support this valuable cause. 'The adverts can be found on YouTube for anyone who would like to revisit them.' ITV has been contacted for comment. Fans of the actress lined up to pay heartfelt tributes after her death on Sunday, October 19. Among those remembering her were Prince Charles - who said she was a 'marvellous actress' and he backed her push to get more older people into work. The Prince of Wales said he was 'greatly saddened' by her death from cancer, praising her 'tireless' work for other people. Mrs Bellingham was best known for playing mother in the Oxo Christmas adverts from 1983 to 1999, as each year her family grew up around her.

A food artist has created a portrait of the late Lynda Bellingham entirely out of Oxo cubes - the food she spent more than 15 years advertising on TV. Fine art graduate Nathan Wyburn, 25, from Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, created the tribute by putting beef stock cubes in water and painting the mixture onto a canvas. The work by Mr Wyburn, whose specialises in creating celebrity images using food and household items, took around two hours to complete. Fitting tribute: Artist Nathan Wyburn created this portrait in Lynda Bellingham's memory using Oxo cubes . 'I wanted to create a fitting and respectful tribute to Lynda, and thought it was only appropriate to use Oxo cubes,' he said. Other pieces of work by the artist have included portraits of William and Kate made out of crackers, and images of Joey Essex and Katie Price painted in fake tan. 'The work was great fun to create,' he said. 'I love using food as an art medium, there’s so many colours, textures and even smells that make the portraits quite unique.'

"Roy Keane has warned Phil Jones he needs to toughen up if he wants to make it as a Manchester United player. Jones was touted as the new  Duncan Edwards when he signed in a £16.5million deal from Blackburn Rovers in 2011. But Keane claims the defender has spent too much time injured and, like team-mate Chris Smalling, who signed from Fulham for £10m a year earlier, has gone backwards in his  development.

If anything I think they have gone backwards. ‘You . say you have to give players a chance to mature, but also you’ve got . players who you say, “We’ve given you a chance and you’re not taking . it”. They need to do a lot better if they want to cement their place at . United. ‘Jones needs to toughen up. Every time I see him he is getting carried off.’ Roy . Hodgson has picked both players in his England World Cup squad but they . are likely to be in only as back-up to Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka in . the centre of defence. Asked if they were good enough to cover at . centre back, Keane added: ‘Not on their current form. The two of them . have had  disappointing seasons. ‘But . England might need them, you may get players who get injured. Maybe in . other positions they might be needed. Maybe that is one of the reasons . why Roy has taken Jones and Smalling, with the thinking that they can . play full back or midfield.’ Been there and done it: Keane spent 12 years at Old Trafford and made over 300 appearances for United . There . could be more pressure on the pair to perform for United after this . summer’s tournament now that Nemanja Vidic has left for Inter Milan and . Rio Ferdinand is not having his contract renewed. Ferdinand . was disappointed that he was informed of the decision by chief . executive Ed Woodward straight after their final game of the season . against Southampton, but Keane said he shouldn’t be surprised. He said: ‘If United are interested in keeping players or doing deals, they would have done it months ago. ‘It . is no shock to hear that he is leaving. It happens when you get to 35, . that’s the other side of football.

"Eighteen months ago, at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium, English cricket enjoyed one of the most pleasurably unexpected Test wins in its history. Much has been made of the contribution to that victory of Kevin Pietersen, and understandably so: here was proof of what, by then, was becoming a cliche – that he was a player of great innings, if not necessarily a great player. But the unexpectedness resided mainly in the fact that England had outspun India – and that they did so after India’s captain MS Dhoni had called, with a tone of voice that sounded dangerously close to enthusiasm, for a turning track. On the outside looking in: England have problems in the spin department now Graeme Swann has retired . Graeme Swann had match figures of eight for 113, and Monty Panesar 11 for 210. Between them, and despite India’s batsmen having first use of the pitch, Ravichandran Ashwin, Pragyan Ojha and an over-the-hill Harbhajan Singh managed nine for 400. The world had gone mad. Those unearthly few days came to mind this week as we surveyed the domestic scene a month into the first season after the retirement of Swann. And the fact was this: as play resumed on Monday morning in the sixth round of County Championship matches, not a single spinner sat in the top 10 of the Division One bowling averages. Highest in the list was Warwickshire’s New Zealand off-spinner Jeetan Patel, whose 14 wickets at 25 placed him 12th. Next came Simon Kerrigan, the Lancashire slow left-armer who has yet to shake off the stigma of his Ashes meltdown at The Oval. He was 23rd, with 10 wickets at 27. The situation was slightly rosier in Division Two, where Glamorgan’s left-armer Dean Cosker (18 at 17) was third in the averages, and Kent’s offie Adam Riley (14 at 19) was 10th. And if the 22-year-old Riley fits neatly into the ‘one to watch’ category, Cosker is 36. With the best will in Wales, he will never play for England. April and May have never been auspicious months for English spinners. June isn’t great either. July is reasonable, because pitches have started to dry out, but August is when the slow bowlers start to cash in. This August, there will be one full round of Championship matches. The dice have always been loaded against English spinners – or at least they have been since the advent of covered pitches. Yet, as England seek to embark on the post-Swann era, it is troubling that this should still be the case. Swann’s five-year Test career allowed English cricket to pretend there was not a problem, while the bowler himself allowed the Test team to play a four-man attack. And because he gave the ball such a rip, he could take the moral high ground when it came to questioning the legitimacy of deliveries he didn’t need, such as the doosra. But he might just as easily have been called Black instead of Graeme: this particular Swann’s progress has been the exception, not the rule. It was no coincidence that Swann learned his trade on the turning tracks of Northampton, before honing it on less helpful surfaces at Trent Bridge. One taught him how to attack, the other how to defend: unusually among English spinners, he spent his Test career doing both. Second spinners: Lancashire's Simon Kerrigan (left) has 10 wickets at 21 in Division One, while Adam Riley has 14 at 19, but they have been taken in Division Two for Kent . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . Yet counties no longer produce turners, for fear of producing pitches marked ‘poor’ and ripe for the penalising. And so we had the curious situation last summer in which dryness was to be found at Test venues only, the better to help Swann beat Australia. And he obliged, with 26 wickets at 29 each. In 2015, England won’t be able to try the same trick, because a combination of dodgy weather, questionable scheduling, seaming surfaces that increase a county’s chance of a result, and our traditional suspicion of anyone who bowls more slowly than 75mph (or more quickly than 90) will have regressed our cricket to its mean – to a world in which the spinner is tolerated rather than nurtured. There is talk this summer of producing bouncier tracks to defeat Sri Lanka and India, and it may well work. Panesar may fill in for a few games, before the debate reopens about his batting and fielding. But none of it will change the fact that, with Swann now out of the way, English cricket’s chickens are coming home to roost. Clear your diaries! Pity the cricketers of India. With the IPL final taking place on June 1, and their flight to England leaving on June 22, the three-week hiatus looked like the perfect time to count earnings and recharge batteries. Except that the BCCI have decided to use the downtime to play a – what else! – three-match one-day series in Bangladesh. One of the consequences of leading the putsch at the ICC earlier this year was that India had to throw sweeteners this way and that to get the vote through. Three games in five days in Dhaka in mid-June, so keeping the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s TV partners in clover, was one of the conditions. And India are taking the trip so seriously that both MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli will sit it out. The administrators must be proud. On their knees: The India team could be very tired by the time they land in England in late June . In Delhi 10 days ago, umpire Sanjay Hazare refused to refer a run-out appeal against Kevin Pietersen to his TV colleague. Replays showed Pietersen was out by a foot, and Rajasthan captain Shane Watson’s repeated requests for a replay proved in vain. Hazare later put this strangeness down to ‘a human error’. Now, he has been removed from the IPL’s umpiring panel. According to the IPL chairman Ranjib Biswal, ‘there are many reasons’. Whatever can he mean? So, . the Big Three are going to take charge of cricket’s anti-corruption . drive? Will that be the same Big Three that is headed up by N . Srinivasan, who has been instructed by India’s Supreme Court to step . down as BCCI President while investigations continue into the IPL . spot-fixing scandal that occurred under his watch? Yes, it would. As . England subsided to 88 all out against the Netherlands in Chittagong . last month, it was widely agreed that they had missed a calm head, a . wise old bird who would have taken one look at a target of 134 on a slow . pitch and decided to milk his way to victory. Sitting . on the sidelines throughout the World Twenty20, of course, was Ian . Bell, who reminded everyone of his class on Friday by making 50 off 34 . balls on a dog of a pitch in Aberdeen against Scotland. The start of a . new era can also mean Bell reclaiming responsibility at the top of the . Twenty20 order. Sweeping statement: Ian Bell's innings against Scotland reminded England of his limited-overs prowess . We may have given the impression two weeks ago that Yuvraj Singh – one-time slayer of Stuart Broad – was a busted flush, incapable of getting the ball off the square and emblematic of a Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise that was too busy admiring all its big-hitters to actually get out there and win games of cricket. We now realise we owe Yuvraj an apology. In Sunday’s game against Rajasthan Royals, Yuvraj rolled back the clock to thrash 83 off 38 balls, then took four wickets with his left-arm pies. All was right with the world – until Steve Smith and James Faulkner added 85 in 5.2 overs to nick it for the Royals. Still, one step at a time… .","None of top 10 bowlers in County Championship Division One is a spinner .

"At the age of 81, Sir Michael Caine says he's ready to retire from acting . From Zulu to the Italian Job and Get Carter, he has starred in some of Britain’s most famous films. But at the age of 81, it seems Sir Michael Caine may be ready to call it a day. The actor has revealed he has ‘probably retired’ and will not make another film unless he is sent a script he cannot refuse. Speaking to BBC2’s Newsnight, Sir Michael said his latest film Youth, in which he stars alongside Harvey Keitel and Rachel Weisz, is likely to be his last. He said: ‘I have no ambitions now… all I do is, I do films that I really want to do. ‘If I don’t get a script – which I don’t have – that entices me out, I’ll be done in December when I do the last picture, the last script I’ve got. ‘I always went into every movie with an aim. It was either to get an Oscar or make money, that’s the two reasons I do movies. I’ve got two Oscars and I’ve got some money so I’m alright.’ At a charity night at the Royal Albert Hall to honour his long career, Sir Michael dropped further hints that his film days may be over, saying: ‘I’ve probably retired now but I go home and there will be a great script and I think ‘oh I’ll do one more’. I look to see if it challenges me.’ Sir Michael first shot to fame in 1964’s Zulu, in which he had to mask his Cockney accent to play an upper class British officer. Recalling the moment he was cast, he said: ‘I was due to play the cockney corporal but they said can you do a posh accent? The funny thing with the English class system is I bet an English director wouldn’t have given me that part but being American he didn’t know the system. ‘They said to me: “I’ve seen you a lot on screen now and you look gay - to Americans, English officers look gay.” But it was funny because then I got nominated for an Academy Award for Alfie who was screwing every woman who could.’ Sir Michael Caine in a scene from The Italian Job, 1969. The actor's latest film, Youth, will probably be his last . Caine as an upper-class British officer in Zulu (left) and Charlie Croker in The Italian Job (right) Caine shooting scenes for his new movie Youth alongside scantily-clad Romanian model Madalina Ghenea . Since then, Sir Michael has appeared in more than 100 films and won two Oscars, a Golden Globe and a Bafta. In some of his best remembered roles he has played criminals and gangsters, such as in The Italian Job and Get Carter. He enjoyed a career resurgence in the 1990s after having practically retired from acting, and has been nominated for an Oscar in every decade since the 1960s. However, Sir Michael said he was uncomfortable with being labelled a national treasure. He said: ‘You don’t know what to do when you’re a National Treasure you don’t have a special restaurant you can go to called National Treasures you don’t do a course in it, I just live my life.’ He added: ‘I didn’t set out to be a movie star or rich and famous that would have been a stupid idea for a Cockney boy. I set out to be the best actor I could ever be. I never get television scripts, I get so many movie scripts, I love movies.’","Sir Michael Caine, 81, says his latest film Youth will probably be his last .

Crumb, the 22-year-old’s collection of recipes, offers snippets of advice calculated to turn many a Bake Off fan as pale as their flour. Miss Tandoh stands up for soggy bottoms – an unforgivable faux pas in the eyes of judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood – and disagrees with many of the methods 79-year-old Miss Berry uses in her 70 cookbooks. Perhaps it’s not surprising that Miss Tandoh wants to break the mould, given that she once called Bake Off ‘crap TV’. Still, fans, who can tune in to the semi-final of the BBC1 show tonight, may want to hold on their chef’s hats. Here are Mary Berry’s baking rules and Miss Tandoh’s responses: . SOGGY BOTTOM . Mary: ‘Often, contestants are asked to make a tart or quiche, and even if they bake it blind, sometimes the pastry is still raw underneath. Baking blind and drying the pastry out before you put the filling in. That’s the key [to avoiding a soggy bottom].’ Ruby: ‘The term “soggy bottom” has given rise to a national neurosis, whereby a pie is declared a disaster if its pastry base isn’t perfectly crisp. 'These impossible standards might be how success is calibrated in patisseries and TV shows, but they have no place in the home kitchen. I’d go so far as to say we should champion the soggy bottom: I can see nothing not to love about buttery pastry sodden with fruit juices, or custard, or gravy.’ MELTING CHOCOLATE . Mary: ‘Put the chocolate into a large heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water; the base of the bowl should not touch the water.’ Ruby: ‘Gently melt the chocolate – either in short bursts in the microwave or in a heatproof bowl perched over a pan of simmering water.’ Breaking the mould: Miss Tandoh, pictured during last year's series of the Great British Bake Off, disagrees with many of the methods 79-year-old Miss Berry uses in her 70 cookbooks . THE 'KNIFE TEST' Mary: ‘To see if the loaf is done, insert a fine skewer in the middle; it should come out clean.’ Ruby: ‘Don’t be overzealous: The knife needs to come out clean-ish, but if you wait until it is bone dry then you will have baked the cake too long.’ Finalist: Miss Tandoh joined Kimberley Wilson, left, and winner Frances Quinn, right, was named one of the top three bakers by judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood in last year's series . YEAST . Mary: Uses fresh yeast in her recipes . Ruby: ‘There are many who argue that fresh yeast produces a better tasting loaf. I disagree.’ CHRISTMAS PUDDING . Mary: ‘[After cooking] cover the pudding with fresh greaseproof paper and foil. Store in a cool place for up to three months.’ Ruby: ‘Just soak the fruit on Christmas Eve, make the pudding batter in a jiffy in the morning and leave to quietly steam for two hours on the hob while dinner’s in the oven.’","Last year's finalist Ruby Tandoh, 22, has collection of recipes called Crumb .

"Sleazy pick up artist Julien Blanc has been chucked out of Australia after a massive backlash since his arrival this week. American Blanc was due to hold one of his seminar's at Melbourne's Como Hotel but it had to be cancelled after a massive uproar on social media. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has told Sky News he decided to cancel Mr Blanc's visa, reports ABC. Mr Morrison said: 'This guy wasn't pushing forward political ideas, he was putting a view that was derogatory to women and that's just something that our values abhor in this country.' Scroll down for video . Controversial 'dating coach' Julien Blanc uploaded this image of himself with Russell Brand on Instagram around 18 months ago . American Blanc was due to hold one of his seminar's at Melbourne's Como Hotel but it had to be cancelled after a massive uproar on social media. Scott Morrison said: 'This guy wasn't pushing forward political ideas, he was putting a view that was derogatory to women' Protest scenes: Angry demonstrations erupted on Thursday over a seminar Blanc was planning to deliver in Melbourne . Screams of 'shame, shame' were heard at the protest . A man wearing a Darth Vader mask appears to be restraining a protester . A spokesman for MP Scott Morrison told Daily Mail Australia: 'The Minister's office can confirm Mr Blanc's visa was cancelled and he has departed Australia.' Blanc described how his choking pick up technique makes him seem like a 'rock star celeb' with a 'f***ing attractive, like, magnetic personality' at a seminar where he encouraged his followers to be more like the comedian Russell Brand. Daily Mail Australia has obtained a recording - removed from Blanc's YouTube account - of the lecture where Blanc makes the remarks, ‘Russell Brand’s Secret to Having a Magnetic Personality: Get Flashed While Behaving Like a Rockstar’. Victoria Police announced on Friday that Blanc had left Australia overnight after outraged protests erupted over his dating techniques, which include performing a so-called 'choke opener' on women. He also once told a seminar how he grabbed Japanese girls' heads, placed them on his crotch and yelled 'Pikachu!' '#ChokeOpen': One of Julien Blanc's techniques to seduce women involves grasping them in a chokehold . 'Diss fatties bang hotties': Julien Blanc's controversial techniques have been deemed 'sexist' and 'racist' Police were called to the scene of the protest at Southbank . The river cruise boat docked at Southbank . In his remarks, Blanc said the best way to stand out to women was to 'do what most people wouldn't do and get away with it'. 'If you take, like, any celebrity, like f***en', Russell Brand, for example, what does he do? 'He does the s*** that most people wouldn't do. 'He pushes it a little bit further - that's it - and he gets away with it. 'You do that, you stand out.' He said his choking pick up technique was an example of 'pushing it a bit further', although he recommended that attendees should not perform the move 'at home'. 'Most people wouldn't do that,' he said. 'Now by me doing it and getting away with it, BANG, now I stand out. 'She's like, oh shit, here's that main guy. Here's, like, that rock star. Here's that celeb. 'Here's that f***ing attractive, like, magnetic personality.' He said people can get away with things like this if they do it in the spirit of 'self-amusement' and fun. 'As long as it's genuine fun, you can choke the girl.' 'That's usually my go to. If I go and choke if she like tenses up, I'm like, 'ha ha it's sexy! Ha ha, yeah, look it's like Star Wars, you're supposed to walk into it? 'How can you get mad about someone who says it's like Star Wars? You can't. 'If you want to do whatever you want, as long as you're having genuine fun, you're good.' He said Russell Brand could get away with trouble because people expected it of him. 1. Yelling 'Pikachu!' and placing their heads on his crotch . 'At least in Tokyo, if you're a white male, you can do what you want,' Blanc says, in a seminar recorded on video. 'I'm just romping through the streets, just grabbing girls heads, just like, ""head, on d***"", ""head, on d***"", yelling ""Pikachu!"" with a Pikachu shirt.' 2. 'Deadly' jokes . A blog post on Blanc's 'Real Social Dynamics Nation' website appears to suggest using cruel jokes as a way of picking up women. The post is titled '""My Girlfriend Passed Away"" - The Twisted Humor That Inevitably Knifes Through To Her Panties. Explanatory YouTube videos placed in the article have been taken down. A Tinder exchange also published on Blanc's website shows a person, who is chatting up a woman on the dating app, suggesting that the person's father had died. 'I just buried my father today.. Who would lie about something like that,' the person writes. 3. The 'choke opener' Blanc is pictured choking women and hushing them in multiple Instagram posts. In one caption, written on October 10, he dubs this his 'choke opener', a means of starting a seductive conversation with women. 4. Use 'pull talk' In a video on the RSD Nation website, Blanc encourages his fans to use 'pull talk' - or, 'spewing bulls***' - while physically leading women to the 'sex location'. 'Your words? Spewing bulls***,' he explains. '(They are) wizard stories, pull talk!' 'It's very light hearted, it's very fun, it's kind of like: ""Oh yeah so when this, oh yeah and what about this. 'Just any f***ing thing you want to say and again, your actions are making it happen. ' 'Your actions are taking the responsibility off of her, they're leading, it's not permission seeking, and that is how you move closer to the sex location'. 5. 'Deconstruct her self-esteem' Another blog post provides tips about how to 'manipulate' a woman's self esteem. 'Click on this video right now that (sic) reveals how to deconstruct any girl's self-esteem,' the post says. But the clip has since been removed from YouTube. Blanc has been pictured taking women into a chokehold at venues around the world . Teacher: Julien Blanc has instructed several crowds how to pick up women . 'It's like, of course he would say that obnoxious s***. If it was anyone else, it would be harder to get away with it.' Blanc has not responded to requests for comment despite numerous interview requests from Daily Mail Australia via email, voice message and social media. Eighteen months ago, he posted a selfie-style image of himself with Brand. He did not provide the story behind the image, sounding excited about the encounter in his caption. 'Pimp it?' it said. '#RussellBrand #RightNow'. Blanc's forthcoming tour to the United States likewise appears in jeopardy. Touched down: Blanc wEarlier this year in June, the 'dating coach' charged men $3,000 each to attend a seminar in Miami . The Courtyard Marriott in Seattle tweeted: 'This event will no longer be taking place in our hotel.' Staff at another venue, the Hilton Garden Hotel in Austin, Texas, wrote on Facebook: 'We will not be having this seminar in our hotel in support of the values we believe in'. In an interview with SBS's The Feed program last night, #takedownjulienblanc campaign organiser Jennifer Li, from Washington DC, said: 'I didn't know this was going to actually take off, I just knew I had to try in order to tell myself, ""you know, I did something""'. In a Change.org petition, initially addressed to Melbourne's Como Hotel, Ms Li labelled Blanc's pick-up techniques 'sexist' and 'racist'. 'Julien Blanc... has made a living by teaching men how to violate women through physical and emotional abuse,' she wrote on the petition. Ms Li went on to say the hotel should not soil its good name by associating with 'a man who chokes women around the world as part of his pick up game'. She asked the hotel to stand up for the women of Australia and around the world and not to host the event which would teach other men 'how to violate and harass women'. When the hotel announced it had cancelled Blanc's visit, it was bombarded with thanks on social media.","Pick up artist Julien Blanc has had his visa cancelled after Victoria Police confirmed he had left Australia .

"It is the most damning statistic of all: no goals in eight appearances. It is Wayne Rooney's record in World Cup finals, and his record in major tournaments in general has hardly been inspiring. Rooney has scored five goals in six appearances in European Championships but four of those came at Euro 2004, his breakthrough tournament when the then 18-year-old was widely acknowledged as one of the stars. Since then there has been the broken metatarsal and red card of Germany 2006, non-qualification for Euro 2008, the brooding, angry young man berating supporters at South Africa 2010, and the player suspended for the first two games of Euro 2012 and who looked short of match fitness for the two in which he subsequently played. It is no . record for a player who aspires to be among the world's greats. Prior to . recent tournaments there has been an attempt to build up expectation . and construct a sustainable argument to suggest that this time it will . be different. But perhaps the climate of major tournaments does not suit Rooney's . physiology? Maybe he is simply more susceptible to the end-of-season . fatigue that affects most Premier League players? Maybe he just is not . as good as some think he is, although that theory would not account for . the manner in which he can impose himself on Champions League games. Certainly England manager Roy Hodgson accepts that Rooney is box office . and, as such, the demands from the public will always be high. 'He knows . the expectations,' said Hodgson. 'He knows how much everyone who writes . about, watches or discusses English football demands of him. All I can . say is I'm confident he'll give us the best he's got. You can only hope . your attempts to prepare him mean that when he gets on the field he'll . think, ""I feel good and I'm going to do the things that made people . build me up so high"". 'It must be the same for Hollywood film stars. When you make your first . film and nobody knows much about you, you might get some good reviews. But one day you're going to be [a superstar like] Al Pacino or Jack . Nicholson and suddenly every film you make has to be very good.' Despite Manchester United's slump, Rooney has at least had a good season, in which he has seemed leaner and sharper. There are no obvious debilitating injuries to fear, the club insisting that he has been rested in the past few weeks to ensure he would be fresh for Brazil and not because his groin problem was serious. Previous: Wayne Rooney has failed to score in eight matches at World Cup finals . Rooney is so determined to be fit for this World Cup that he headed out to the Algarve last week, taking not only his family but two physiotherapists to help him prepare for England's pre-tournament training camp in Vale de Lobo, also in Portugal. The first competitive sight anyone will have of him will be against Peru on Friday week in England's friendly match at Wembley. The pre-tournament arrangements will be better suited to his temperament, too. In 2010 it included two weeks' seclusion in the Austrian mountains, followed by a remote training ground in rural South Africa. Fabio Capello's intention was to insulate his players but for the likes of Rooney it proved to be too restrictive. Under Hodgson and a back-room team of English staff, the needs of English players will be catered for better this time. Miami, the venue for two England friendlies in the first week of June, and Rio de Janeiro, should provide ample stimulation. Disappointment: Rooney's appearances at World Cup finals have been blighted by injury . But the key factor in enabling Rooney to demonstrate his worth may be the players around him. The relative abundance of attacking options in Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck, Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling as well as the potential fluidity of the team suggests Rooney ought to feel more at home. It may well be the first time in his career in which an England team has actually been better than the United team for which he plays. 'I don't think we're going into this tournament with anything to fear, in terms of his commitment, fitness or desire,' said Hodgson. 'So from that starting point, if you compare it to 2012, when he couldn't play the first two games and he was disappointed and frustrated, then it's looking better for us. 'I'd like to think the squad we've picked . is a very good one, with lots of exciting players. He won't have to . shoulder the total burden of goal-scoring and goal-making, which he has . at previous tournaments. There are plenty of players out there for us . who can score or make a goal. So if I was Wayne, I'd be thinking: . ""Right, this is looking good, I've got good players around me, this is a . great opportunity"".' Outburst: England striker Wayne Rooney shouts at camera after Algeria game at 2010 World Cup . Roy Keane, a former team-mate of Rooney's and an ITV pundit for the World Cup, agrees that the intensity for Rooney ought to be reduced this year. 'I think there is less pressure on Wayne,' said Keane. 'He still puts himself under the same pressure, but it's not coming from the media as much as before when he has gone in injured or with off-the-field stuff going on. 'There was stuff with Fabio Capello and an unhappy camp in 2010. This time I think Wayne has gone away to get a bit of sun and the fact that he has missed a bit of  football over the last month or two is no bad thing. 'People shouldn't be panicking. I have heard that he has taken medical staff away with him on his holiday - I am sure his wife is delighted with that! But sometimes you need down-time, the discipline to relax and rest the tendons, the muscles, your fibres, the mind which is probably the most important thing. 'I'm guessing but I think Wayne will be going into the World Cup in a good mindset and again I think he is surrounded by better players in attacking positions who can see more of a pass than previous squads have going into big tournaments. He has gone in on the  back of injuries before, I think there has always been that pressure on Wayne. But I think he is surrounded by better players now, who are on good form.' Setback: A dejected Rooney after England lost to Italy  in the quarter final of Euro 2012 . Certainly you would hope that the image of an exasperated Rooney waving his arms in frustration, stranded up front alone as the defence and midfield retreat deeper and deeper, would be consigned to the past. Clearly there will be periods when England concede possession and as the deeper-lying striker, Rooney will be expected to track back. Equally though, with Sterling, Lallana and Sturridge likely to be in the team, England will at least attempt to play at speed and with some style. Hodgson hopes so at least. 'It gets suggested, ""He was a disaster in such and such a tournament"" and, therefore, every time I talk about a tournament now I'm expected to refer back to that tournament and say what a disaster he was,' he said. 'But I refuse to go along with that baggage. It's not me who's said, ""2004 was great and since then it's been bad."" I'm not saying that. 'The only thing I would dare talk about Wayne with regard to tournaments is 2012. And there he tried very hard. He wanted it very badly. You could argue he wanted it too badly. 'This time I'm going to see a totally different person - hopefully, the person you're describing who burst onto the scene in 2004. Because he's only 28 years of age, he's in the best age of his football career. I suppose I could say that if he was terrific in 2004, he should be even better now.' In reality, any player who fails to deliver for his nation in major tournaments will be damned by many football judges as having failed to make it into the higher echelons of the game. Quizzed as to whether this was fair. Hodgson reached for a lesson from the team's resident psychiatrist, Steve Peters. 'I'll give you Steve's answer to that one,' said Hodgson. 'He hasn't got far with me because I'm still making the old mistakes I always make. But every now and again there's a moment of epiphany and one has just come to me: ""Life is not fair"".'","Rooney has failed to score in eight matches at World Cup finals .

"Eden Hazard has eased Chelsea fears that he is unhappy at Stamford Bridge with a vow to improve next season and help the club become champions of Europe once again. The Belgian winger also admitted that manager Jose Mourinho had been right to drive him hard and demand more from him. 'It’s true and it’s good,' said Hazard. 'I prefer it when we speak like this, rather than saying things like: ""He’s the best and he doesn’t need to work"".' Hazard, Chelsea’s 17-goal top scorer, was voted PFA Young Player of the Year but tired towards the end of the season.

I must do better: Eden Hazard says that Jose Mourinho was right to criticise him in recent weeks . Hard work? Mourinho accused Hazard of not sacrificing himself to the team against Atletico Madrid . His failure to track back and defend was also criticised in the Champions League semi-final defeat against Atletico Madrid, prompting Mourinho to say the 23-year-old was not ready to 'sacrifice' himself for the team. 'I know maybe I have to do better in training or on the pitch,' said Hazard, in an interview with the Chelsea magazine. 'I want to score more and help the team score more goals and next season I hope we can be better. 'I try to play like I did when I was a young boy playing in my garden. Sometimes it’s good, sometimes it’s not so good but I try to always make sure I give my best to help the team, even if I am not having the best game myself. 'When you are young, you sometimes play one good game and then one bad game. This season I was able to be more consistent which is good for me.'

Deserved: The Belgian was named Chelsea's Player of the Year, as well as the PFA's Young Player of the Year . Chelsea reached the last four of the Champions League and finished third in the Barclays Premier League, four points behind champions Manchester City, and Mourinho knows Hazard has the speed and talent to propel this team to a higher level. 'This season we didn’t win any trophies but we were back in the Champions League,' said the Belgian. 'For a young player like me it is good to play for a club that can get to the semi-finals, because one of the reasons I play football is for these big games. 'This season was an ‘almost’ season – almost getting to the Champions League final, almost champions in the Premier League. Next season, with this team, we can win the Premier League and maybe the Champions League. 'Individually I am very happy because I can play in every game, I can be on the pitch and do what I like to do, which is play football. It was a good season for me but, as the boss says, we finished third and I hope next season we finish first. I always want to score more goals and improve, that is a big objective.'

"Victim: Jesse Cortinez, 58, was killed Friday night after a teen ran into him with his car. Police say the teen struck Cortinez after the older man refused to buy him alcohol . A 58-year-old man in Texas was killed in a hit and run late Friday night by a 16-year-old boy who he refused to buy alcohol for at a 7-Eleven. Victim Jesse Cortinez was found dead on the side of the road near 7th and Butternut Street in Abilene around midnight. Witnesses were able to provide a description of the car that hit Cortinez, and the following morning police arrested the teen boy suspected of carrying out the violent attack.The suspect has not been named because he is a minor. 'It's shocking to know that someone would do something like that without letting anybody know why,' Cortinez's 16-year-old daughter Mary told Big Country Homepage. Cortinez was last seen at the 7-Eleven near his home, where he went to buy a bottle of Coca-Cola Friday night. Investigators say the teen approached Cortinez outside the store Friday night and asked Cortinez to buy him some beer. They say Cortinez declined and that the teen drove into him while he was walking away - just two blocks from home. A vehicle matching the description was found early Saturday behind an Abilene home. Police arrested the teen after speaking with a number of people found at the home.

Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o and Henrik Larsson will be on show according to Portuguese publication O Jogo, while Xavi and Andres Iniesta's participation depends on their fitness after the World Cup. Messi made his debut in a Barcelona shirt at the Dragao Stadium, and the match will give him a chance to link up with his idol once again. A teenage Argentine eventually oversaw Ronaldinho's departure to AC Milan with his sparkling displays, but owes a lot to the former No 10. 'Ronaldinho made everything much easier for me,' Messi told Barcelona's club website last year. 'He was also responsible for the change in Barça. It was a bad time and the change that came about with his arrival was amazing. 'In the first year, he didn’t win anything but people fell in love with him. Then the trophies started coming and he made all those people happy. Barça should always be grateful for everything he did.'

"A Native American chief has called for a boycott of FedEx until the Washington Redskins - who play at FedExField - change their team name. Osage Nation Chief Geoffrey M. Standing Bear wrote a letter telling tribal employees to stop using the service until the name is changed 'to something less inflammatory and insulting'. 'Other reports reveal the name Redskins is derived from a horrible former practice of removing the skin of Native people for the purpose of collecting bounties,' he wrote, KRMG reported. His tribe added in a news release that Redskins owner Daniel Snyder 'chooses to stick with a brand which dictionaries define as disparaging and offensive'. Scroll down for video . Boycott: Osage Nation Chief Geoffrey M. Standing Bear has written a directive to all tribal employees telling them to stop using FedEx until the Washington Redskins - who play at FedExField - change their name . FedEx bought the naming rights to the stadium in a 27-year deal for $207 million in 1999. The tribe, which has 18,000 members, is based in Osage County, Oklahoma. But it is not the only one planning to boycott the services. The National Congress of American Indians has spoken out against the name, while the Native Voice Network, which represents Native American organizations, has also targeted FedEx. The Native Voice Network, which says the name has a negative, dehumanizing effect on children, told CNN that they supported Standing Bear's call to boycott the company. 'We're very proud of their position and we'd love to see other tribal communities do the same,' she said. As well as owning the naming rights, FedEx's chairman, president and CEO Fred Smith is also part of the team's ownership group. Patrick Fitzgerald, FedEx's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said the company is proud of its links to the stadium, which is used by a wide-range of groups. 'Offensive': FedEx bought the naming rights to the stadium in a $207 million deal in 1999 - but now Native American tribes have attacked the company for supporting the team name, which they say is insulting . Defense: Team owner Dan Synder, pictured in August, has insisted that the name honors Native Americans . But he added that 'we continue to direct questions about the name to the franchise owner'. Snyder previously said the name 'captures the best of who we are and who we can be, by staying true to our history and honoring the deep and enduring values our name represents'. The owner insists that the name honors Native Americans, rather than disparages them. The Osage Nation, which is based in Pawhuska, is among several Oklahoma-based tribes that have called on the team to change its name. Those tribes include the state's five most influential -including the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole nations - that represent more than 500,000 tribal citizens across the U.S.","Osage Nation Chief Geoffrey M.

"Patients will wait no longer than a week to receive test results for cancer under a Labour government, Ed Miliband has pledged. The Labour leader said the cost of the pledge would be met by a £150million-a-year levy on tobacco companies, with most of that cash going towards more testing equipment. But medical chiefs warned that the 'simply buying new equipment' would not solve the problem. Ed Miliband has pledged that patients will receive cancer test results within a week, should Labour come to power after next year's General Election . In an interview with The Times from a first-class carriage of an East Coast Main Line train from London to his Doncaster constituency, Mr Miliband promised to make tackling cancer a priority if Labour come to power after next year's General Election. He said: 'One in three of us is going to get cancer during our lifetime — that's incredibly scary. It's a massive killer. 'The number of people waiting more than six weeks has doubled — we are talking about millions of people each year.' But medical bodies questioned whether Mr Miliband's seven-day pledge would work in practice. Giles Maskell, president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: 'Simply buying newer and better equipment is not the answer unless you have the people to operate it and interpret the results.' 1) Cancer test within a week . 2) GP appointment in 48 hours . 3) Thousands more doctors and nurses . 4) Social care champion for the elderly . 5) Spending on competition lawyers and privatisation to be scrapped . Suzy Lishman, from the Royal College of Pathologists, said: 'There is no 'one size fits all' test for cancer diagnosis and many patients require more than one test.' A total of 10,600 people waited longer than six weeks to receive routine cancer test results, the latest official statistics showed. The NHS aims for 93 per cent of patients who may have cancer to be seen by a specialist within two weeks - a benchmark which has been met. However, another target - for 85 per cent of cancer sufferers to begin treatment within 62 days of being referred by a GP - has been missed in recent months. Labour has already promised that people will be able to book appointments to see their GP within 48 hours, as the party looks to focus their campaigning around the NHS (file picture) Labour has already promised that patients will be able to book an appointment with a GP within 48 hours, as the party looks to capitalise on the NHS being one of the few sectors the public trusts them with more than the Conservatives. The one-week cancer test results promise would be in place by 2020 and is one of five 'patient guarantees' that the party is making. Just under six per cent on NHS spending goes towards cancer, which kills around 160,000 people a year in the UK. Labour claims that diagnosing cancer earlier would reduce costs. Cancer charities welcomed the Labour promise. Rosie Loftus, from Macmillan Cancer Support, said: 'Far too many cancer patients are diagnosed far too late to have a fighting chance of long-term survival.'","Ed Miliband promises patients will get cancer test results back within a week .

"A UFO photobombed astronauts making repairs to the International Space (ISS) earlier this month - setting off a wild frenzy of speculation online. The spooky incident happened on October 7, when Flight Engineers Reid Wiseman of Nasa and Alexander Gerst of the European Space Agency conducted a spacewalk outside the International Space Station to fix an electrical problem. In video shot by Nasa and uploaded to YouTube last week, the UFO can be seen hovering just for a few seconds behind the astronauts, before the camera cuts to another angle. Scroll Down for Video . What is it? The astronaut is seen making the repairs in the center of the frame - while circled in red is the UFO . As always, the size and shape of the mysterious craft could not be made out and of course, the footage appeared grainy. The UFO appears during the video at around the 1.50 minute mark and the apparently elliptical craft hovers a short distance behind one the astronauts. Work: The astronauts carry out their work on the ISS just moments before the UFO became visible . Intricate: The three astronauts are seen here at the beginning of the video around one minute before the UFO appears . According to the Examiner one possible explanation for the UFO is that it could be one of two resupply craft that visited the ISS. The Space X Dragon ship arrived at the ISS on September 23 and that space ship was followed up two days later by a Soyuz TMA 14M craft that brought three new crew members. However, both the craft are currently docked with the ISS and the UFO in the video appears not to be attached to the ISS. A more likely explanation than a craft piloted by beings from another planet observing human astronauts is lensflare. Light could easily have bounced off the ISS and refracted onto the camera. But, observers have pointed out that there doesn't seem to be a strong source of light near to the astronauts when the UFO is seen. This may rule out lensflare and keeps the object confirmed as a genuine UFO.","UFO appears very briefly during NASA YouTube video uploaded last week .

"Blastoff for the spacecraft which could one day take humans to Mars is set for the final countdown as Nasa revealed the capsule has been completed. It will blast the experimental capsule in orbit using a huge Delta IV Heavy Rocket already waiting on the launchpad - although the rockets are then expected to be replaced by Nasa's even bigger Space Launch system. The assembled Orion crew module, service module, launch abort system and adapter will reside in Kennedy's Launch Abort System Facility until its scheduled rollout to the launch pad, set for Nov. 10. Scroll down for video . NASA's Orion spacecraft was completed Thursday, Oct. 30, 2014 in the Launch Abort System Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It will reside there until Nov. 10, when it will be rolled out to Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station ahead of its Dec. 4 test flight. The three common booster cores are 134 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter. Each has an RS-68 engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant producing 656,000 pounds of thrust. All totaled, the three Delta IV boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust. The second stage of the Delta IV rocket is 45 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter. It uses one RL10-B-2 engine, also burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant creating 25,000 pounds of thrust. At the launch pad, it will be lifted onto the United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket that will carry it into space for its uncrewed flight test. 'This is just the first of what will be a long line of exploration missions beyond low earth orbit, and in a few years we will be sending our astronauts to destinations humans have never experienced,' said Bill Hill, deputy associate administrator for Exploration Systems Development . 'It's thrilling to be a part of the journey now, at the beginning.' 'We've been working toward this launch for months, and we're in the final stretch,' said Kennedy Director Bob Cabana. Last month the Delta IV Heavy rocket, built by United Launch Alliance, made its move  to nearby Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The rocket's three Common Booster Cores were tested, processed and attached to each other to form the first stage that will connect to Orion's service module. It then was raised Wednesday from the horizontal position into its vertical launch configuration. 'Orion is almost complete and the rocket that will send it into space is on the launch pad. 'We're 64 days away from taking the next step in deep space exploration.' Orion was moved Sunday out of the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida as its launch abort system was fitted. This system is designed to protect astronauts if a problem arises during launch by pulling the spacecraft away from the failing rocket. During the December, uncrewed flight, the jettison motor, which separates the launch abort system from the crew module in both normal operations and emergency, will be tested. For Orion's dry run, the Lockheed Martin Corp.-built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast, and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays. Once the launch abort system is stacked on the completed crew and service modules, and the three systems are tested together, the Orion spacecraft will be considered complete. It then will wait inside the launch abort system facility until mid-November, when the Delta IV Heavy rocket is ready for integration with the spacecraft. The Delta IV Heavy rocket (left), built by United Launch Alliance, made its move Tuesday night, to nearby Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The three primary core elements of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta IV Heavy rocket have now been put together, forming the first stage of the launch vehicle that will send Orion far from Earth to allow NASA to evaluate the spacecraft's performance in space. The three Delta IV Common Booster Cores were attached in ULA's Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF), at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The HIF building is located at Space Launch Complex 37 where the mission will lift off. During its Dec. 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space. It will then take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. During the two-orbit, four-hour mission, engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety, the launch abort system, the heat shield and the parachute system. The data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models. The flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later Orion flights. The capsule will re-enter Earth's atmosphere at speeds approaching 20,000 mph, generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The first booster was attached to the center rocket in June with the second one was attached in early August. 'The day-to-day processing is performed by ULA,' said Merri Anne Stowe of Nasa's Fleet Systems Integration Branch of the Launch Services Program (LSP). 'Nasa's role is to keep a watchful eye on everything and be there to help if any issues come up.' Stowe explained that during major testing experts from Nasa's Launch Services Program monitor the work on consoles in Hanger AE at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Hangar AE is home to the Kennedy Space Center's upgraded Launch Vehicle Data Center. The facility allows engineers to monitor voice, data, telemetry and video systems that support expendable launch vehicle missions. The huge Delta IV Heavy rocket w earlier this week put together for the first time at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida ahead of a first test flight of the Orion capsule in December, a mission known as Exploration Flight Test-1. NASA's Florida spaceport is also where Orion was built and is being processed. The Delta IV rocket stages were assembled at the ULA plant in Decatur, Alabama, about 20 miles west of Huntsville. After completion, the rocket components were shipped down the Tennessee River and Tombigbee Waterway, a canal, to the Gulf of Mexico. From there they traveled to Cape Canaveral, arriving on May 6. The elements of the rocket's first stage were then transported to the HIF for preflight processing. 'After the three core stages went through their initial inspections and processing, the struts were attached, connecting the booster stages with the center core,' Stowe said. For Orion's dry run, the Lockheed Martin Corp.-built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast, and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays. A Delta IV rocket will do the heavy lifting. It will eventually be launced by Nasa's new Space Launch System 'megarocket'. For its first flight test, SLS will be configured for a 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed Orion spacecraft beyond low-Earth orbit. In its most powerful configuration, SLS will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons (143 tons), which will enable missions even farther into our solar system, including such destinations as an asteroid and Mars. When asked by a reporter, Cabana said he wishes Orion's flight pace was quicker. 'But it is what it is,' he said. 'Given the budget that we have, I think we've got the best program that you could imagine.' Orion has its roots in the post-Columbia shuttle era; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low Earth orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the Constellation moon project.","Three Delta IV boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust .

"NASA's spacewalking astronauts  replaced a failed electrical unit at the International Space Station on Wednesday, restoring full power to the orbiting lab. The space station had been operating since spring with only seven of its eight solar-power channels. The work by Reid Wiseman. 38, and Butch Wilmore, 51, — NASA's second spacewalk in two weeks — brought the energy capability back up to 100 percent. NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman (right) and Barry Wilmore (left) seen working inside the International Space Station previously on October 1, 2014 . The spacewalkers encountered balky bolts but still managed to complete the job in the allotted time, with less than two minutes to spare. 'Yoo-hoo!' they cheered as NASA declared victory. The voltage regulator shorted out in May but could not be replaced until now because of a yearlong hiatus in non-emergency spacewalks by NASA. The stoppage was caused by spacesuit problems, most notably a flooded helmet that nearly cost an astronaut's life in 2013. NASA astronauts are shown repairing a failed power regulator outside the International Space Station on Wednesday . Wiseman took part in the Oct. 7 spacewalk that jump-started NASA's outside maintenance, accompanied by a German. This time, Wiseman, of Maryland, was joined by Wilmore, of Tennessee, who made his first spacewalk. To avoid an electrical shock, the two spacewalkers waited until darkness before attempting to remove the old voltage regulator, so there would be no discharge. They took in the view 260 miles below as they waited for the space station to fly into the night side of Earth. 'I see Cairo!' Wiseman said. 'Can't quite make out the pyramids, though.' Sunset came over Kazakhstan and China, and Wiseman began to undo the bolt holding down the bad regulator. His pistol grip tool failed to loosen the bolt. 'I can feel it binding up,' he said. A ratchet wrench — along with some muscle — did the trick. NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman (pictured here) at the International Space Station on  October 7 . Wiseman removed the 330-pound boxy regulator from its slot and, with Wilmore's help, popped in the new one. But once again, they ran into bolt trouble, this time in securing the new device. The minutes ticked away as Mission Control debated how much longer to keep up the effort, before stopping for the next orbital sunrise. With less than 10 minutes remaining, flight controllers advised Wiseman to try tightening the bolt with the ratchet wrench. It worked. 'Outstanding news,' Mission Control radioed. Flight controllers immediately checked out the newly installed system, with less than three minutes to go. Success was declared with one minute and 45 seconds remaining. The voltage regulator, officially called a sequential shunt unit or SSU, is needed to keep excess power from its designated solar wing, from overloading the station system. Power is regulated at about 160 volts. After the May breakdown, NASA transferred space station systems dependent on the failed power channel to a backup. No operations were hampered, but NASA wanted that channel operating again for full capability and redundancy. It should be back up and running normally again by Thursday. With their main job completed, the spacewalkers installed a new camera, and moved around various camera and wireless radio systems. The relocations are needed to get ready for the eventual arrival of new commercial crew vehicles. That's still a few years away. 'It's been a very successful day,' Mission Control said as the six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk drew to a close. A Russian spacewalk, meanwhile, is on tap for next Wednesday.","Astronauts Reid Wiseman, 38, and Butch Wilmore, 51, replaced a failed electrical unit at the International Space Station .

"Presenter and model Jameela Jamil has battled her own demons when it comes to body image and now she's calling on more to be done to help young people. The 28-year-old Radio 1 DJ from North London joined a roundtable discussion held by Dove on whether body confidence education should be on the national curriculum. She said: 'Body image needs to be a whole school approach so you create a high self-esteem environment.' She added that teenagers should be aware that, 'you cannot measure your self-worth with a weighing scale.' Campaigning: Jameela Jamil suffered with self-confidence at school and wants more to be done for young people struggling like she did . Action needed: The panel, organised by Dove for Body Confidence Week, called on schools and the government to do more . It's a lesson she has had to learn herself the hard away after she grew up feeling inadequate and wishing to be thinner and prettier. Previously, in her column for Company magazine, she revealed how she struggled with her self esteem and was bullied when she was a pupil at Queen's College, a private school in London's Harley Street. She said: 'I look back at my old school journals and they're full of self-hatred, full of me condemning myself for not being prettier, richer, more popular. 'School was horrific for me, constantly an outcast for being a geek. I've been every kind of bullied – emotional, physical, racial. I've had my body battered and I've been called a ‘""fat P***’"".' Mumsnet founder Carrie Longton said: 'Instilling body confidence needs to be a two-prong attack between parent and schools' Body confidence campaigner Natasha Devon, left, and Dr Phillippa Diedrichs also spoke at the event . At the discussion held as part of Body Confidence Week, leading commentators on the subject said more needed to be done in schools to prevent experiences like Jameela's. Lucy Attley, Dove UK Brand Director said: 'I don't think anyone can deny what impact school has on children's upbringing, it's massive.' PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) expert Pooky Knightsmith agreed, as the panel called for body confidence education to be on the national curriculum. She said: 'There is a really important role for education here… It is very important from a young age that we start to develop the skills, knowledge and understanding that young people need in order to embed this.' Dr Phillippa Diedrichs a Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Appearance Research said it's an issue schools and the government should be taking more seriously. 'Talking about schools is really important… there are (also) governments that can be doing more than just talking about the issue. Body Confidence is a public health issue, it's a social issue – it is not trivial,' she said. Worried about their appearance: Nearly half of 11-14 year old girls told Dove researchers they opt out of everyday activities such as swimming and speaking up in class because they don't like how they look . Past behind her: Jameela is now a successful model and presenter despite having low confidence at school . Mumsnet founder Carrie Longton added that 'instilling body confidence needs to be a two-prong attack between parent and schools.' Research by Dove as part of their Be Real campaign has found nearly half (47 per cent) of 11-14 year old girls opt out of everyday activities such as swimming and speaking up in class because they don't like how they look. Jameela said, in her experience, the problem isn't one just concerning young people. She said: 'My friends are all in their thirties and they're quite intelligent, talented women and I don't know any single one of them who's got a healthy relationship with food or with their own bodies. Not one, literally.' She added: 'I work with some of the most beautiful women in the world and there's not one of them who can take a compliment.' Dove's researchers found three quarters (73 per cent) of adults agree the UK is suffering from a body confidence epidemic, 90 per cent think issues relating to body image are not improving and seven in ten (71 per cent) agree that children in particular are under unbearable pressure about the way they look. 'As Founding Partner of the Be Real Campaign, we believe it is unacceptable that more than half the UK population suffers from body image anxiety. It's a critical public health issue that causes depression, health and relationship problems, poor participation in school and lack of progression at work,' said Dove's Lucy Attley.

"A modified exhaust tested by Mercedes in Spain has failed to make the new cars sound any louder,  Nico Rosberg claimed on Wednesday. The noise produced by this season's 1.6-litre turbo engines has come under scrutiny from most corners of the sport this season with a working group subsequently tasked to find a solution. Mercedes, who supply engines to four teams on the grid, have led the development process in cooperation with the FIA and under Bernie Ecclestone's insistence. VIDEO Scroll down for Nico Rosberg: New exhaust trialled by Mercedes has failed . Picture that: The tail pipe on the back of Nico Rosberg's Mercedes has been widened to improve the noise . On track: Rosberg, who now trails Lewis Hamilton in the world championship, exits the pits on Wednesday . New look: The tail pipe has been dramatically widened since Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix . The 'trumpet' design was unveiled for the . first time on the back of Rosberg's W05 hybrid during Wednesday's test . at the Circuit de Catalunya. But the German revealed afterwards that the tail pipe, which had been widened in order to create more volume, failed to do so. 'It wasn't a great solution,' Rosberg said said in a video posted on Instagram. 'It just didn't work. It didn't make it much louder. So we'll just have to look for another solution.' The season's dominant team, runaway winners of all five races so far, had agreed to try out the trumpet-like device to try and pump up the volume after complaints that the new V6 turbo hybrid cars were too quiet compared to the old V8 screamers. Life in the fast lane: Pastor Maldonado topped the timesheets after a difficult weekend in Spain . The softer sound provided an immediate controversy when the season started in Australia in March with some race promoters, who met in Barcelona on Saturday, fearing ticket sales could fall off if fans were alienated by the lack of decibels. Others in favour of the quieter new era argue that increasing the noise goes against the greener spirit of the regulation changes, which reduce wasted energy from the exhaust and brakes and harness it to improve fuel economy. 'It's an interesting moment in time for Formula One,' Mercedes motorsport head Toto Wolff said last weekend. 'Traditionally you would have said... that Formula One needs to be loud to be spectacular. Maybe now that's changing.' While the noise, or lack of it, was a talking point on Wednesday others got on with their regular business. Ina action: Susie Wolff was testing for Williams ahead of her grand prix debut at Silverstone later this year . Job done: The British driver was fifth fastest in Barcelona on Wednesday . Red Bull had quadruple champion Sebastian Vettel in their car while Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado topped the fairly meaningless timesheets with Lotus. Williams had Susie Wolff getting acquainted with their car before she becomes the first female driver since 1992 to feature in a grand prix weekend when she takes part in practice at Silverstone in July. She was fifth fastest and completed 55 laps. Belgian reserve Stoffel Vandoorne had his first drive of a Formula One car and completed enough laps with McLaren to secure the superlicence he will need if a race seat comes his way.","Nico Rosberg tested the modified exhaust system in Spain on Wednesday .

"A primary school has appointed 10-year-olds as ‘packed lunch police’ with the power to inspect the food younger pupils bring to school (file picture) A primary school has appointed 10-year-olds as ‘packed lunch police’ with the power to inspect the food younger pupils bring to school – and even issue warnings if it is unhealthy. Parents have started a petition against the scheme after receiving a letter telling them to pack only healthy items. Brooke Johnson, 34, whose children Charlee, seven, and Riley, five, are pupils, said: ‘It’s crackers. I decide what my children eat for lunch, not a 10 or 11-year-old.’ The letter from Hall Road Primary Academy in Hull states: ‘Year 6 will be packed lunch police and will be checking what children have in their lunches, with warning slips given if lunches do not meet our standards and awards for those that do. ‘Your packed lunch may include bread, pasta, crackers, rice, wraps, meat, cheese, fish, small yoghurt, fruit and vegetables. In order to be a healthy school, your packed lunch may not include crisps, chocolate spread, fizzy drink/energy drinks or food that needs heating up, eg micro chips.’ All pupils in the first three years of primary education have been provided with free school meals from this month – partly to stop parents giving children unhealthy food. But parents can still send their children with a packed lunch if they wish. Miss Johnson, who started the petition, added: ‘My little girl came home from school starving because she hadn’t dared open her lunchbox. ‘She knew I had packed her sandwiches, crisps, a sausage roll, a small chocolate bar and apple juice. ‘I don’t see why she should risk being given one of these warning slips by another child just for eating her packed lunch. It’s ridiculous. 'If these kids are inspecting my children’s sandwich fillings, how can I be sure they are washing their hands after going to the toilet and aren’t picking their noses? One six-year-old boy was given a warning slip just for having a Kellogg’s cereal bar.’ Headmistress Caroline Holliday said: ‘This healthy-eating campaign has been driven and implemented by our children themselves.’ At another school, parents have criticised ‘bullying’ staff for seizing snacks and drinks from lunchboxes. Families began a petition after Caen Community Primary School in Braunton, Devon, started confiscating chocolate, crisps and fizzy drinks. Chairman of governors Joanna Howard said removed items would be returned at the end of school, and a free, healthy alternative was offered. But Rob Lott, 38, whose three children attend the school, said: ‘It’s entirely pointless. Children are being bullied into eating specific foods.’ Parents have started a petition against the scheme after receiving a letter telling them to pack only healthy items for their children (file picture) Schools should consider providing pupils with an evening snack alongside their breakfast and lunch, the Education Secretary said last night. Nicky Morgan suggested that children who stay behind in after-school clubs so their parents can work should be given some ‘tea’. Mrs Morgan made her comments at a fringe meeting at the Tory Party conference, when she was asked whether more schools should be using their buildings to provide childcare facilities. She said schools already provide breakfast clubs and after-school clubs. She said she would consider a proposal from a Conservative councillor that poorer children receive free breakfasts, funded through the pupil premium. A source at the Department for Education said that if children are staying at school late it would be ‘unfair’ not to feed them.","Hall Road Primary Academy in Hull has told Year 6 to check pupils' dinners .

"Al Pacino is returning to the London stage in a play for the first time in 30 years, and vows: ‘There will be decadence!’ The Oscar-winning legend told me he will lead a full production of Oscar Wilde’s Salome in the spring of 2016. Pacino has performed productions of Salome in Brooklyn and Los Angeles, but they were more rehearsed play readings than a full, dressed-up show. Al Pacino said he will be leading a full production of Oscar Wilde’s Salome in the spring of 2016 . ‘We’ll be wearing clothes for London,’ he joked when we chatted at a splashy dinner at the Corinthia Hotel off Trafalgar Square, where the 74-year-old was being honoured with the British Film Institute’s highest honour, the BFI Fellowship. ‘There will be make-up, sets, costumes . . . and decadence. It will be a whole different thing to what we did in America,’ he promised. ‘We had Jessica Chastain play Salome in Los Angeles, and made a film of the play. It was her first film. We lucked out on her, but we need to discover a new actress to play Salome in London. We’re all looking,’ he said, referring to Salome’s director Robert Allan Ackerman and his long-time producer Robert Fox. Pacino added that he had been ‘addicted’ to Wilde’s Salome ever since he saw Steven Berkoff in it in London back in 1989. He said he’s hoping to appear in a new play, possibly by David Mamet, in New York before doing Salome in London the year after next. ‘Otherwise, I’d be here sooner,’ he added. Pacino starred alongside Jessica Chastain in the film version of Salome which opened on Sunday . The filmed version of Salome, starring Chastain, and Wilde Salome, an insightful documentary about Pacino’s obsession with the piece, was screened at the BFI National Film Theatre and broadcast into cinemas by Omniverse Vision last Sunday. The films will be released on DVD/download on November 10. Pacino appeared in Mamet’s American Buffalo at the Duke of York’s Theatre in 1984. Various attempts to get him treading the boards again failed, though he did present an Evening With Al Pacino at the London Palladium last year. That doesn’t exactly count as proper theatre, though. The actor was at the BFI event on Wednesday with his lively romantic partner, actress Lucila Sola. John Hurt, Joan Collins, Richard E. Grant and Ian Holm were among those who popped open a few bottles of Moet to toast Pacino at the Corinthia. Though flutes were replenished, promptly and often, by sommeliers, there was some amusement when guests attempted to open the magnums of Moet & Chandon proudly displayed on each table — only to find they were movie prop dummies. Even so, it was still what Pacino called a ‘classy affair’. The Billy Boys are back in town . Liam Mower said he was the ‘diddy’ one of the original three lads who played Billy Elliot on stage. Now, the 22-year-old ballet dancer towers over fellow Billy, James Lomas, 24. (George Maguire was the third member of the trio, when the show first hit the Victoria Palace stage.) All three will be taking part in a special Billy Elliot show on Sunday afternoon that will be beamed by Working Title and Universal into cinemas. Liam will play ‘grown-up’ Billy, just for that special performance; while James, George — and 22 other actors who play played the role over the past nine years — will dance in a finale that has been choreographed by Peter Darling. Director Stephen Daldry said it was ‘phenomenal’ to see them all together. ‘They’re the extraordinary legacy of the show.’ Darling, meanwhile, said he wanted to ensure that every single actor got to show off their best skills on Sunday. ‘Some boys are at the Royal Ballet, one is a tattoo artist, one’s a movie actor, others are dancers and singers. They’re all different,’ Darling said. Twenty-three of the Billy boys were joined by Ruthie Henshall, the show’s current leading lady, for this picture. Watch out for... Olivia Vinall who was in Othello and King Lear at the National Theatre — and who’ll be back there, starring in Tom Stoppard’s new play The Hard Problem. Nicholas Hytner will direct: his final production as artistic director of the NT. The drama will run at the Dorfman Theatre in January. Back in July, the playwright revealed the title to me, joking that it was a bit premature to say too much about it, but adding that it’s not about ‘erectile dysfunction’. However, I understand that it’s a very contemporary piece, set in some kind of thinktank organisation. Guy Pearce, who will portray F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Dominic West, who will play Ernest Hemingway in Genius, the first film to be directed by lauded stage director Michael Grandage. They join Colin Firth as Max Perkins, a legendary New York book editor who handled Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe. Jude Law will play Wolfe; Nicole Kidman is Wolfe’s lover Aline Bernstein, and Laura Linney plays Louise Sanders, Perkins’s wife. The screenplay for the movie, produced by Grandage and business partner James Bierman, is by John Logan.","Al Pacino revealed he will be starring in Oscar Wilde’s Salome in London .

"The countdown has begun for the Orion spacecraft’s test flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 4 December. Nasa’s latest capsule, which will take astronauts on deep space missions, now has its rocket in position and is undergoing final checks. Ahead of its launch, Nasa has released a video named ‘Trial by Fire’, which outlines each of the daring stages on Orion's 3,600 mile (5,793km) journey above Earth . Scroll down for video . The countdown has begun for the Orion spacecraft’s test flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 4 December. Nasa’s latest capsule (artist's impression pictured), which will take astronauts on deep space missions, now has its rocket in position and is undergoing final checks . In a 4.5-hour mission, Nasa will use a Delta IV heavy rocket to launch the craft 100 miles (160km) above the Earth's surface. Upper stage rockets will then take it 3,600 miles (5,793km) out into space - just far enough to pass through the Van Allen radiation belts. The Van Allen radiation belts are two concentric rings encircling the Earth and held in place by a magnetic field. Since the Van Allen belts were first discovered in 1958, astronomers have been trying to trace the source of the super-acceleration. The Delta IV Heavy rocket that will launch the test flight has been already put in place on the launch pad, and the Orion capsule will be transported there around 10 November. In this image, a United Launch Alliance crew prepares to move a Delta IV heavy rocket to the launch pad at Cape Canaveral . In a 4.5-hour mission, Nasa will use a Delta IV heavy rocket (illustrated) to launch the craft 100 miles (160km) above the Earth's surface. Upper stage rockets will then take it 3,600 miles (5,793km) out into space - just far enough to pass through the Van Allen radiation belts . The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object. Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loops around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean - likely the Pacific - 10 days later. The mission is seen as an important step towards sending humans to Mars. The acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belts . The Orion capsule has been outfitted with sensors to take new readings on the belt and ensure that it doesn't interfere with any of the capsule's onboard electronics. Orion will re-enter Earth’s atmosphere at almost 20,000mph (32,180 km/h), and reach temperatures near 2,200°C (4,000°F). At this stage, its parachute system will deploy to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. The Delta IV Heavy rocket that will launch the test flight has been already put in place on the launch pad, and the Orion capsule will be transported there onaround November 10. This Delta system is designed to protect astronauts if a problem arises during launch by pulling the spacecraft away from the failing rocket. During the December flight, the jettison motor, which separates the launch abort system from the crew module in both normal operations and emergency, will be tested. For Orion's dry run, the Lockheed Martin-built capsule will have chunks of aluminium in place of seats for ballast, and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays.

It will then wait inside the launch abort system facility until mid-November, when the Delta IV Heavy rocket is ready for integration with the spacecraft. Orion has its roots in the post-Columbia shuttle era; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low Earth orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the Constellation moon project. On future missions, Orion will carry astronauts farther into the solar system than ever before, including to an asteroid, and Mars.

"David Cameron today tore into the Labour party for walking out on talks on English votes for English laws, accusing Ed Miliband of 'not being interested in fairness' for the whole of the UK. Labour announced it would boycott talks on addressing the English problem, branding government plans 'a closed shop stitch-up'. It came as a Commons debate got underway on devolving more powers to Scotland in the wake of the independence referendum. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured todayat Age UK headquarters in London, accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of not being 'interested in fairness' after Labour vowed to boycott talks on English votes for English laws . In the days before Scots voted on leaving the UK, Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg published a 'vow' to hand control over more laws and taxes to Scotland. Hours after the result showed 55 per cent of people rejected independence, Mr Cameron announced that he wanted to also tackle the problem of stopping Scottish MPs voting on laws which only apply to England. Today Mr Cameron rejected the suggestion that he was playing politics with the Union following the vow made to the people of Scotland during the referendum campaign. He said: 'What we need is obviously more devolution for Scotland but a settlement that's fair for the whole of the United Kingdom. 'I think it's a matter of great regret if Labour are going to walk out of this Cabinet committee which they could join in and make their suggestions. 'But obviously they are not interested in fairness across the United Kingdom so we will have to work hard with other partners to make sure we deliver.' Commons leader William Hague today told MPs that devolution of increased powers to Scotland will go ahead as promised, regardless of talks on English votes . Former PM Gordon Brown warned against English votes for English laws . People living in Scotland must be recognised as a minority, Gordon Brown said today as he railed against plans for English vote for English laws. The former prime minister warned that implementing proposals to devolve income tax to the Scottish Parliament in full and then depriving Scottish MPs of voting on the Budget would be 'absolutely lethal to the constitution'. The Labour MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath said: 'You cannot have one United Kingdom if you have two separate classes of MPs.' Mr Brown said the 'fundamental question' affecting the British constitution was not the West Lothian question, which he argued was a symptom of a more fundamental problem about the fair distribution of power. Speaking during a Commons general debate on devolution following the Scotland referendum, he said: 'The fundamental question in the British constitution is that when you have England 84 per cent of the Union, Scotland 8 per cent of the Union, Wales 5 per cent of the Union, Northern Ireland 3% of the Union... 'You have the reality that at any point the votes of England could outvote Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland individually or collectively. 'The real fundamental issue, the real issue is a fair distribution of power, that respects not only majority rule - and I am sensitive to the needs of England and to English voters - but also respects the rights of the minorities so that we have stability and we have harmony in the British constitution.' He said every generation had had to come to terms with 'how you get that balance right between the majority rule and the needs of the minorities that are part of the UK'. Downing Street has made clear the talks will go ahead without Labour, and said it would be for Ed Miliband's party to explain its absence if it chose not to take part. Commons leader William Hague has been appointed chairman of a Cabinet committee tasked with drawing up proposals, and he has invited other parties to take part in talks. But a Labour source has confirmed the party will not take part, saying: 'We need proper reform, not a closed-shop stitch-up in a Cabinet room.' In the Commons today, Mr Hague warned insensitivity and indifference to the English votes problem is the greatest threat to the Union. He insisted that the vow of further powers for Holyrood would happen in all circumstances. But he said increased devolution to Scotland following last month's No vote created an imperative to improve representation and decision making for all parts of the Union. Mr Hague told MPs: 'I know there are MPs who argue that to address this question is to somehow put the United Kingdom itself at risk, but I say to them the United Kingdom is in greater danger if the legitimate arguments and expectations of English decision making, on decisions effecting only England, are not responded to. 'Insensitivity and indifference is the danger to the union in all nations including in England.' Speaking during a noisy Commons session, Mr Hague insisted the Cabinet committee he chairs at the request of the Prime Minister was the best way of resolving the immediate questions over England, Wales and Northern Ireland. And he suggested the Government could be open to a constitutional convention to discuss the wider issues raised by greater devolution to the different nations of the Union, but not on the basis it would delay the immediate discussions and decisions. Mr Hague criticised Labour for abandoning the committee, adding: 'It has been proposed there should be a constitutional convention to discuss these issues in the future and the Labour Party can come to the Cabinet committee and put that forward - but they seem unwilling to do so. 'Indeed, the Government will consider the proposals for the establishment of such a body on the right terms and at the right time.' However, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has accused Mr Cameron of already 'reneging' on pledges made during the referendum campaign. 'The Prime Minister started the process of reneging on the commitment when he came out of Downing Street hours after the referendum and said that progress in Scotland should be in tandem with ... constitutional change in England. Even Gordon Brown is finding it difficult to stomach,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The First Minister also indicated that he did not view another referendum as completely off the agenda. 'What I said was that the referendum was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,' he said. 'My view is that constitutional referendums came along once every political generation - about every 20 years or so. 'Circumstances obviously can change. Clearly, if you had a situation where three leaders made such a public vow - not even a political promise but a vow - in the last few desperate hours when they thought they were losing the referendum campaign and then reneged upon it, then that would obviously be a very, very substantial change of circumstances. 'These matters ultimately are for the people of Scotland to decide. It is for the people of Scotland to decide whether it is satisfactory to be conned and tricked by Westminster leaders, or they will exact a revenge at the ballot box.'","David Cameron condemns Labour for walking out on negotiations .

"The parents of murdered schoolgirl Alice Gross have said how the 'future looks bleak' without their daughter, who is thought to have been killed by a convicted murderer. Hundreds of mourners were moved to tears after a recording of the talented musician singing  Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah  was played at her memorial service today. Her mother Rosalind Hodgkiss described the pain she feels when talking about Alice and said she 'cannot imagine life without her'. The 14-year-old disappeared in August and despite the biggest police search since the aftermath of the July 7 bombings, her body was not found until more than a month later. Scroll down for video . Rosalind Hodgkiss said the killing of her daughter had left her numb with grief, and the future looked bleak . Alice Gross, 14, was a talented musician and a recording of Hallelujah she produced was played at the service . Hundreds of people turned out for the ceremony in Middlesex, organised by Alice Gross' family to thank them . Speaking at the ceremony her mother, Rosalind Hodgkiss said: 'I have been numbed by shock and grief, I have felt outrage and anger at the loss of her life and unbelievable sadness at the emptiness that has been left. 'I have wracked my brains for all the 'what ifs' of that day, anything that might have stopped this random, incomprehensible tragedy. 'It is even harder to talk about that pain than it is to talk about Alice. I cannot imagine life without Alice.' The teenager who was a talented musician, played piano, violin and ukulele and had started to learn the guitar. Dozens of people turned out for the memorial service held today in tribute to Alice and their efforts to find her . The humanist service was organised by Ms Hodgkiss and her father Jose Gross (right) after Alice was killed . Alice wrote and sang her own songs and a recording was played on Sunday, with her father playing the guitar . Footage of the teenager singing was shown on large screens during the memorial service held today . During the service, held at Greenford Town Hall in Middlesex, a recording of her singing and playing violin to Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah was played, with her father joining her on guitar. A video was also shown on a big screen at Greenford Hall in London of her performing one of her own songs, called Don't Go Away. Ms Hodgkiss added: 'I think of all the ... hugs, shared jokes, evenings spent snuggled on the sofa, goodnight kisses, the confidence of after-school conversations, Alice playing the piano in her dressing gown (and) singing, shopping, baking, the way Alice still called me 'mummy'. 'The future seems bleak without Alice.' Alice was last seen alive on August 28 on CCTV . She said the things she would miss most would be celebrating her daughter's birthday, Christmas, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day and her own birthday. Ms Hodgkiss said her daughter could be shy and often did not realise the extent of her musical talent. She added: 'I think of all the every day moments. Hugs, shared jokes, evenings spent snuggled on the sofa. 'Alice was loving and kind in so many ways. I had recently been training for a hundred mile charity walk. 'When I came home from a (training session) Alice cooked me breakfast. She took a photo because she was proud of how she made it. 'She showed her love in little acts of kindness. Alice was fizzy and fun with a lovely sense of humour. 'She laughed loud and often and we often laughed with her.' The teenager was buried during a private ceremony 10 days ago but today's service was held  by the family to thank the community for their help in trying to find their daughter. Ms Hodgkiss said support from the community had not made the loss of Alice any more bearable but had 'restored some of our faith in humanity.' Alice's father, Jose Gross told the service it has been 'very difficult to deal with this sudden, dramatic and tragic event'. He described walking her to primary school through woods and trees and how they both missed that time together. Mr Gross also told how they had planned to play 'open mic' nights together, saying: 'I think we would have been quite high in the 'aahhhh' factor, beautiful teenage daughter sings with old rock veteran dad,' raising a laugh from well wishers. Violinist Fenella Humphreys performed during the memorial held at Greenford Town Hall in Middlesex . Hundreds of mourners turned up to pay tribute to the talented musician from Hanwell, in west London today . Alice Gross is pictured as a child (centre left) with her mother Rosalind Hodgkiss (left), father Jose Gross (right) and her sister Nina Hodgkiss (right) during a family outing with the Hanwell youngster . Several people were left in tears after a video of Alice playing piano and singing an original composition 'Don't let it Go Away' was played. A tribute from Alice's sister Nina was read by Caroline Black, a renowned humanist. Nina said: 'Alice was a kind and thoughtful sister. She could always make me laugh with her funny voices and silly faces. 'I wish I could have had a last chance to go on a walk with you in the rain. 'I do find peace in knowing that nothing can hurt you any more.' The 14-year-old was last seen alive walking along a tow path in west London on August 28, and it is believed that she was murdered by convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns, who was caught on CCTV following her on his bike. It was more than a month before her body was found weighted down in the bed of the River Brent, near where she lived in Hanwell, west London. Zalkalns, who had previously served seven years for murdering his wife Rudite in his native Latvia, was found hanged in nearby Boston Manor Park on October 4, four weeks after he was reported missing to the police. Jose Gross and Rosalind Hodgkiss launched an appeal to find Alice after she went missing on August 28 . Dozens of family and friends laid tributes including bright yellow flowers for Alice's funeral, held 10 days ago . Hanwell Clock Tower has become the focus of tributes since the teenager's body was found in September . Detectives are understood to have found DNA to link him to the murder and are now examining files for cases of missing women since 2007, when Zalkalns moved to the UK, the Sunday People reported. After Alice's body was found in September the clock tower in Hanwell became a focus for mourners - many of whom laid flowers and left yellow ribbons in tribute to the teenager. Mr Gross added: 'For five or so weeks the area became emblazoned in yellow ribbons, delivering a very powerful message of support to the public at large and anyone passing by. 'No one could pass through Hanwell and beyond without being aware that Alice was missing and that the community cared. Convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns is thought to have murdered Alice, 14, and was later found dead . 'When I felt very low the sight of the ribbons lifted my spirits.' The service also included photos of Alice visiting Disneyland. Family friend Anna Bradley read William Wordsworth poem 'Surprised by Joy' by another friend Anna Bradley. Many of Alice's music teachers also performed at the service. Serena Kay, her singing teacher, sang We're Walking In The Air, from the cartoon Christmas film The Snowman. A sonnet written especially for the occasion by poet Brian Clark, was also read out by Julian Bell, the leader of Ealing Council. The highly emotional service was attended by family members, friends, teachers, local MPs and representatives from the police, fire brigade, Youth Music and Ealing Council. The community in Hanwell has shown a lot of support to the family. A Facebook page set up to help find Alice attracted 22,000 followers, yellow ribbons appeared tied to railings, buildings and other structures across the area. Some people also helped with the search to find the missing teenager. Around 6,000 runners in the Ealing Half Marathon also wore ribbons. A donations page has been set up following the service for Alice's Youth Music Memorial Fund. David O'Keeffe, spokesman for the National Foundation for Youth Music, which will benefit from the fund, said: 'All of us at Youth Music are very grateful to the family for setting up Alice's Youth Music Memorial Fund in her memory. 'This will be a great help to us in continuing our work to provide music-making opportunities to over 90,000 young people every year. 'Many of them face significant challenges in their lives such as coping with poverty, disability, special needs or perhaps living in care. 'I imagine and hope from what I've heard today that Alice herself would have been pleased to have created a legacy to help these young people experience the joys of music making, as she did.'","Family of Alice Gross held memorial service to thank community for support .

"Click here to read the FA Cup Final match report from Wembley. Mesut Ozil was signed by Arsenal to be the matchwinning difference in their biggest games, but in the club's most pivotal match of the campaign the German international again failed to live up to the hype and expectation during their FA Cup Final 3-2 comeback win against Hull City. The Gunners' record £42.5million transfer for the midfield maestro in September was met with mild fanfare by fans at the start of the season as they looked to end their nine-year trophy drought. However, the former Real Madrid star proved relatively ineffective against Steve Bruce's side in another disappointing big-game performance. Fruitless: Mesut Ozil (right) was disappointing in Arsenal's 3-2 extra time FA Cup Final win vs Hull at Wembley . On the ball: Ozil tries to escape the attention of David Meyler during their Wembley showpiece on Saturday . The . 25-year-old was signed by Arsene Wenger as the man that could be the . go-to-guy for the Emirates outfit but on the basis of his first season . in England this notion has a lot to be desired. Playing . 'in the hole' behind Olivier Giroud, Ozil failed to cause the Hull . defence any problems with either a penetrating through ball or a piece . of skill that his reputation commanded at the start of the season. The . midfielder played 84 passes with an impressive accuracy of 82.1 per . cent, but none of note that hurt Tigers captain Curtis Davies and his . team-mates. Hotspot: Sportsmail's heat map of Mesut Ozil shows he rarely got into Hull's box during their FA Cup Final . Trailing . 2-1 in the first-half, Ozil squandered a fantastic opportunity to bring . his side level completely missing the ball from a low cross - when a . goal looked like an inevitable outcome. That . chance was Ozil's only notable contribution to the game as he looked . neat in possession, but when compared to team-mates Aaron Ramsey and . Santi Cazorla the duo were far more effective at Wembley - highlighted . by man-of-the-match Ramsey scoring the winning goal in extra time. Disappointing: Ozil contributed just one shot and a 33% cross completion rate during the Wembley encounter . Cazorla . started the Arsenal comeback with a sweetly-struck free-kick in the . first-half and his stats show he made 79 passes and with a better . accuracy than his team-mate of 89.9 per cent. Arsenal's hero Ramsey was as equally as impressive as the Spaniard, making 105 passes with an 87.6 per cent accuracy. Revival: Santi Cazorla (left) started Arsenal's comeback with a first-half free kick against Hull . Star performer: Man-of-the-match Aaron Ramsey (right) outshone team-mate Mesut Ozil on Saturday . Matchwinning moment: Ramsey (second right) scored the winner for Arsenal in the 109th minute vs Hull . This . is evident furthermore by Ozil's total contribution of one blocked . shot, and a 33 per cent cross completion rate during the Wembley . showpiece. There . have been accusations that the German needs world-class around him to . perform like he did at Real, but if so what does that mean say about the . ability of Ozil or Arsenal's squad? At . the Bernabeu he was surrounded by the ilk of Cristiano Ronaldo and . Karim Benzema and while the Gunners can boast the likes of Giroud and . Theo Walcott - it is a fair assessment that the latter two are not in . the same calibre as the former – but then shouldn’t the 25-year-old step . up and deliver for his team-mates in the biggest of games? All smiles: Ozil (right) and Bacary Sagna (left) celebrate ending the club's nine-year trophy drought . His . signing was meant to be the Gunners' game-changer but as Real look to . add the Champions League title to their Copa del Rey triumph this . season, it can be heavily questioned if Arsenal did really get what they . bargained for. To . Arsenal supporters it may not matter as they finally ended their trophy . hoodoo and everyone’s entitled to the odd bad game.

"The iconic Christmas trucks come and go in the blink of an eye in Coca-Cola's new advert, as the company gears up for its much anticipated festive season commercial. The annual 'Holidays are Coming' advert, which will debut tomorrow night during the X Factor, has been preempted by another Christmas-themed Coca-Cola commercial in which strangers, family and friends are seen carrying out simple acts of kindness.

"Paul Casey tied the record for the best back-nine in PGA tour history as he catapulted himself into contention on day two of the HP Byron Nelson Championship in Irving, Texas. The Englishman was one over for the day and struggling to make the cut when he reached the turn but then fired six birdies and an eagle to come home in 27 and sit two shots behind American leader Brendon Todd on a congested leaderboard. Casey had fired a 71 on Thursday and after three bogeys and an eagle on the front nine, he was two over for the tournament as he stood on the tee at the 435-yard par-four 10th. Back in it: Casey's astonishing back nine put him right back in contention in Texas . In the lead: Brendon Todd made sure he was on top after two rounds by picking up two birdies late on . But he birdied that and the 11th and picked up further shots on 13,14 and 15 before an eagle on 16 and a closing birdie. That . made him just the eighth player in PGA tour history to shoot 27 over . nine holes and his score was just one shot worse than Corey Pavin's . front-nine record set at the U.S. Bank Championship in 2006. 'I had no concept of what I was doing,' Casey told www.pgatour.com. 'The seal was broken when I got to 10. It just spiraled from there. 'I like to think I would be pretty good at shooting low rounds of golf through the past but certainly nothing like that.' Todd, meanwhile, followed up an opening 68 with an impressive 64 to take a two-shot lead over a large group on six under. Eye on the ball: Martin Kaymer continued his recent good form and shares second place with Casey . The 28-year-old birdied seven, eight, 10, 11 and 13 before dropping his only shot of the day on the par-four 15th. At . that point he was part of a large leading pack on six under but picked . up shots on his final two holes to take a two-shot lead into the . weekend.

"Tony Adams wants the current Arsenal squad to stop calling him ‘Mr Adams’. He wants to stop having to tell them how it feels to be a winner because none of them know. He wants them to start writing their own history, starting with lifting the FA Cup at Wembley. It feels fitting that Adams is speaking at Repton Boxing Club in east London, in front of a black and white poster screaming ‘No Guts No Glory’. He is incredulous that Arsenal could be stifled by the tag of favourites and seems equally unimpressed as he explains Arsene Wenger believes he has a squad capable of winning the Champions League. Mr Arsenal: Tony Adams (left) won plenty of trophies as Arsenal skipper including the 1989 league title . Tear it down: Adams has been honoured with a statue, but wants this generation to write a new history . But then Adams, as he puts it, ‘likes winning things’. The former Arsenal captain can look back on four League titles, three FA Cups and two League Cups between 1987 and 2002. If his old club secure fourth place in the Barclays Premier League and the FA Cup this season it would only mean the campaign has ‘not been a failure; not like having to play in the Europa League like Tottenham’. He adds: ‘None of this Arsenal team knows what it’s like to win a trophy for the club. Arsene remembers, but not these players. ‘I did a Q&A with some of the players the other week, and all the questions about winning were coming to me because they didn’t have the answers. ‘I was talking to Carl Jenkinson and Kieran Gibbs and I was telling them: “You need to know how it feels just to get over the line” because it’s a weird feeling. ‘It was normal for us to win games. I’m not so sure this group of players has that. ‘They call me Mr Adams and stuff! I’m not sure I ever called older players “Mister”. Ambition: Wenger badly wants to win the Champions League after coming so close in 2006, says Adams . Learning to win: Adams has had to answer questions about success to both GIbbs (left) and Jenkinson (right) ‘I want them to be pushing me to the side and ripping my statue down and make their own history. ‘They’re lovely guys, but they need leadership. Mikel Arteta’s a good pro without being, for me, a great player, but he will say “come on”. ‘(Per) Mertesacker’s been more verbal this year. I had a go at Per at the beginning of the season and said: “You don’t have to be Mr Nice Guy, you don’t have to be liked.” You don’t just go through your career letting it go by and missing the moment.’ Adams believes Wenger had ‘10 easy years’ in his first decade at Arsenal, having inherited that famous back five and an ‘unbelievable squad’ of players ‘ready to be taught’. The 47-year-old thinks the Frenchman should sign a new contract at the club, regardless of the outcome at Wembley, but disagrees with Wenger’s optimism about the potential of his squad to win Europe’s most glittering prize. Leaders: Both Arteta (left) and Mertesacker (right) have had to learn to be more assertive this season . ‘I think Arsene really wants to win the Champions League,’ says Adams, ‘and I think he still thinks this group of players can do it for him. While he’s still got that belief, he’ll stick around. ‘If he thought that this squad couldn’t win him the Champions League I think he’d move on to Barcelona or a club that would deliver that for him before he goes to Paris Saint-Germain. ‘Do I share that optimism? No, I don’t. I don’t think the full backs are good enough. They’ve really struggled this year. ‘But I think Arsene should stay. I think, financially, he does fantastic for the club and there’s a great structure in place and better the devil you know. ‘He came in to take over an unbelievable squad, with an untapped French market, and he found a captain who had sobered up six weeks ago and was ready to grab life, instead of grabbing a pint, so a lot of his circumstances are to do with timing. ‘When the teacher appeared, that team was ready to run. I think he had 10 easy years, really.’ In conjunction with The European Azerbaijan Society and to mark World Refugee Week, Tony Adams is promoting a gala charity boxing night at York Hall, East London, on Friday 27th June. Tickets are available at www.Repton-Gabala.eventbrite.co.uk and proceeds will go to the Mo Farah Foundation.","Former Arsenal captain had to answer players' questions on winning .

"The Labour party is now 11 points ahead in the key marginal seats which will decide the next election, a new poll shows. A ComRes survey of the 40 tightest Labour/Conservative battlegrounds for ITV News is a fresh blow for David Cameron, as he reels from two defections to UKIP. Mr Cameron has sought to pitch the next election as a straight choice between him and Labour leader Ed Miliband. Scroll down for video . A new poll puts Labour 11 points ahead in 40 key marginal seats, but 46 per cent of people would rather see David Cameron remain as Prime Minister . David Cameron hopes to present the next election as a straight choice between him and Ed Miliband as PM . According to the poll, 41 per cent of voters in the marginal seats say they will vote Labour, up five points since a similar poll in June. The Tories are on 30 per cent, down one point, with UKIP unchanged on 17 per cent and Liberal Democrats on 6 per cent (down one). In the 2010 general election, Labour and Tories were neck-and-neck on 37 per cent across these seats. However, Mr Cameron led Mr Miliband by 46 per cent to 33 per cent when voters in the battleground constituencies were asked who they would prefer as Prime Minister. Six in 10 people claim Ed Miliband puts them off voting Labour, with 46 per cent saying they would rather have David Cameron in Number 10 . At the Tory party conference in Birmingham, the Conservatives have produced parody beers mocking Labour . The Tories hope to focus the election on voters' fears about Mr Miliband. Mr Cameron said yesterday: 'If you want to have a European referendum, if you want to have immigration control, if you want to get the deficit down, if you want to build a stronger Britain that we can be proud of, there is only one option. 'The choice is really between that government – and we've got a track record now of getting the deficit down, getting people into jobs, taking a correct line on Europe – the choice is that or Ed Miliband in No. 10 Downing Street with no plan for the deficit, no leadership for our country, no way to get the economy growing, the deficit going up, more borrowing, more spending, more taxes. That is the choice,' he told BBC One's Andrew Marr. Overall six in ten (59 per cent) people said that Mr Miliband puts them off voting Labour, including almost two-fifths (38 per cent) who say they back the party. Brooks Newmark, Conservative MP for Braintree (right), has stepped down as Minister for Civil Society following allegations concerning his private life while Tory MP Mark Reckless (left) has defected to UKIP . A third of voters in the marginal seats (33 per cent) said they would consider voting Ukip next year. But half (51 per cent) said they would never vote for Ukip, even if the eurosceptic party could win in their constituency. ComRes head of political polling Tom Mludzinski said: 'These are the seats where the general election next year will be won and lost and Labour have opened up a convincing lead. 'However, despite the polls pointing to a Labour victory, voters in the marginals prefer David Cameron as a Prime Minister to Ed Miliband and the Conservatives will be hoping that is enough to swing enough people back round to back them when it comes to the ballot in May 2015.'","Labour on 41%, Tories 30%, UKIP 17% and Lib Dems 6% in 40 key seats .

"British No 1 defeats Austrian 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 in Rome Masters third round . Murray now into quarter-finals where he will face Rafael Nadal for the first time since October 2011 . One thing you can safely assume when Andy Murray renews acquaintance with Rafael Nadal is that there will be no repeat of the last two sets they played. Strangely, that was more than two and a half years ago when the now Wimbledon champion blew him away 6-2, 6-0 in the last two sets of the Japan Open final. This will be on clay in the Italian Open quarter final, something very different. It is the Big Four rivalry that has ground to a standstill after three Grand Slams in 2011 that saw them meet in the semi-finals, with the Spaniard emerging victorious on each occasion. Concentrated: Andy Murray returns a forehand during his victory over Jurgen Melzer . Resistance: Melzer provided stiff competition for the British No 1 . Best wishes: A fan at the Italian Open sends her birthday greetings to Andy Murray . For a time . on Thursday it seemed that it would be Nadal who might stand Murray up . on this particular date, as he trailed Mikhail Youznhy by a set and a . break before roaring back to win 6-7, 6-2, 6-1. The . Scot, playing on his 27th birthday, had earlier kept his side of the . bargain with a 7-6, 6-4 victory over Austria’s Jurgen Melzer in a . further sign that he might be coming to the boil, albeit slowly, ahead . of the French Open and Wimbledon. We . will find out more on Friday and not just about Murray. By his . extraordinary standards on clay Nadal has been struggling, and again . relied on his remarkable fighting powers to overcome the Russian, just . as he had against France’s Gilles Simon on Wednesday night. Murray . agreed that it was curious the two – who of the old ‘Big Four’ are . probably the closest combination in terms of friendship – had been kept . apart, mainly by injuries and luck of the draw. 'I . haven't practised with him hardly at all, either,' said Murray. 'I will . actually be quite interested to play against him, to kind of see how is . game has changed and also the things I can do to make it difficult for . him, and there will be things that won't work against him, that `I'll . need to change as well. So it might be better for me to play against him . now rather than in the French or at Wimbledon.' Getting into gear: Murray cruised home after a troublesome first set . Blown it: Melzer faded after running Murray all the way in the first set . He . does not see huge signs of deterioration related to unexpected exits in . Monte Carlo and Barcelona over recent weeks: 'No, I think the thing is . the confidence. For example his forehand looks similar to me but it . looked like he was returning pretty short this week and when he is . confident he tends to return a lot deeper. 'He . has made some changes to his backhand during his career, so that might . be the shot that breaks down a little more but I don’t see major changes . in his game. Maybe he isn’t playing his best tennis at times, but he . looked pretty damn good last week. 'When . I was training for three or four weeks, some days the drills and . patterns of play were specific for Djokovic or Federer, and we would . also bring in some left handers, even if they play different to Rafa. I . could still work on the patterns of play that Ivan and myself felt would . work against him. The thing that is different about Rafa is the spin he . generates on his forehand, you can see the stats the amount of rotation . he puts on the ball is pretty incredible. Tough test: Murray will now face world No 1 Rafael Nadal in the last eight in Rome . In the past: Murray and Nadal (right) last played each other in the Japan Open final in October 2011 . 'That’s . the thing that takes time to get used to. The rest of his game is great . but he doesn’t serve like Ivanisevic, he doesn’t return like Agassi, . you always have an opportunity to dictate at some point against him.' Nadal . is also looking forward to the test: 'I have to go on the court and be . aggressive, and I need to play with a little bit more control. It will . be tough. It’s an important match for me because it’s against one of the . best players in the world after two tough days. 'I will need to take my chances. If I don’t I will be spending the weekend in Mallorca.' Murray . served well against Melzer and will look to replicate that and make his . opponent do plenty of running. An unlikely win would really park his . tank on Rafa’s lawn or, to be more accurate, his favourite rectangle of . dirt.","British No 1 defeats Austrian 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 in Rome Masters third round .

"Minnesota's oldest living woman recently tried to open a Facebook account to connect with family and friends, but thanks to her advanced years she had to lie about her age to do it. Anna Stroehr, who recently celebrated her 114th birthday, is simply too old for Facebook's account creation page. The undaunted Plainview woman simply knocked a few years off her age and created her account as a 99-year-old. Forever 99: Seen here celebrating her 114th birthday at a party with family and friends held at her Minnesota retirement community this past Sunday, Anna Stoehr had to lie while creating a Facebook account because it doesn't allow users to be any older than 99 . Silver surfer: Stoehr's love of technology may have come late in life but she's now an avid FaceTime user . Anna's interest in technology came a little late in life, but that hasn't stopped her from adopting as much of it as she can. Not only does she have Facebook now, but the woman who holds the honor of being America's seventh oldest living person is also a frequent FaceTime user on her iPad. Anna first became interested in Facebook thanks to her friend Joseph Ramireza, a Verizon sales rep who once sold Anna's 85-year-old son Harlan a phone for her, according to KARE. 'I just sold him the iPhone and he was talking about his mother and I realized Harlan was 85 years young and I was just astounded,' Ramireza said. He was even more shocked when he learned Harlan's mother's age. Still has a sense of humor: Stoehr has always had a curious nature, according to her 85-year-old son but she turned to old tech to write a letter to Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg. 'I'm still here' is all it read . The two became fast friends and now Ramireza is a sort of technology guide for ever-curious Anna. 'She's become something of a kindred spirit,' Ramireza told KARE. Ramireza has taught his friend to email and use Google and now he's helping Stroehr petition Facebook to get her real age on her account. She dictated a message for him type out on a typewriter and mail to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. 'I'm still here,' it read. Anna is awaiting a response. In the mean time, she celebrates her 114th birthday on October 15. Friends and family held a birthday party on Sunday at her Plainview retirement community.","The website account creation page refused to accept Anna Stroehr's birth year of 1900 .

"Cyberbullying at schools is rife with more than two-thirds of teachers saying they've seen pupils trolling and bullying each other online. And almost half of teachers admit they feel unprepared to tackle the problem. A YouGov poll of 701 teachers also revealed that a shocking 73 per cent fear sexting, grooming and cyberbullying is on the rise at schools. A survey of 701 teachers showed that 73 per cent fear sexting, grooming and cyberbullying are on the rise . Meanwhile almost half of teachers (42 per cent) admitted they have never taught e-safety, while almost a third (30 per cent) say they would feel out of their depth tackling it in class. As well as bullying and trolling, 42 per cent of secondary school teachers said they had seen students sexting. Online child safety expert Professor Andy Phippen . Teachers also admitted being in the dark about what pupils use their smartphones for, with 43 per cent saying they don't understand the apps their pupils use at school. Online child safety expert Professor Andy Phippen said: 'This research suggests that schools may not be doing enough to protect pupils from the dangers of the digital world. 'Further training, technology and resources are needed to support teachers as more and more students carry powerful tablets and smartphones into school. 'Equally, it is important that we teach pupils about the safe use of the internet, rather than simply banning technology in schools, which, while perhaps seeming like an easy option, is actually preventing the fantastic opportunities mobile tech provides for both formal and informal learning.' The research comes as Point2Protect launches a new e-safety service for schools with support from the UK Safer Internet Centre, to help schools manage these online threats. The service is more advanced than typical 'stop and block' e-safety tools. For the first time schools can understand how pupils are using the internet on all the devices they carry. Ian Skeels, Director of Point2Protect, a company that designs internet safety systems and commissioned the research, said: 'For too long there's been confusion between government, schools, and parents over whose responsibility it is to protect young people from harmful online content, both within the classroom and beyond. 'Our service provides the transparent oversight schools need to identify potential issues and start a positive, open dialogue between teachers and pupils about appropriate online behaviour.'","Nearly three quarters of 701 teachers polled by YouGov fear sexting, grooming and cyberbullying are on the rise .

"Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen insists they will not fear Europe's heavyweights when the club returns to the Champions League next season. A runners-up spot behind Manchester City secured the Reds' first appearance in Europe's elite club competition since 2009. Performances over the last 12 months have shown Brendan Rodgers' side have the capability to compete with the best sides, particularly at Anfield, and Allen is looking forward to the prospect. Moving on: Allen (right) thinks Liverpool can progress after narrowly missing out on the title . Looking forward: Brendan Rodgers' team are eager to play Champions League football next season . 'I can't wait. It was something that as a young footballer you dream about,' said the Wales international. 'It is the reason you work hard every day, you strive to try to get there. I can't wait for the next season to kick off and experience one of the pinnacles. 'Obviously this season is just finishing but that is one of the big reasons to celebrate, we will be in the Champions League next season. 'As a player you set targets and goals and one of them is to play Champions League football. And I can't wait and I'm sure the fans feel the same way. 'Last year our record against the big sides was slightly disappointing, but this season we felt confident we could go into any game home or away and win and that's one of the biggest differences this year. Glory days: Allen wants Anfield to be a fortress in Europe, as it was during the 2005 winning run . Letting it slip: Gerrard's mistake, and a draw with Crystal Palace, saw Liverpool miss out on the title . 'That is a big marker for how far we have moved as a club. From an attacking point of view the amount of goals we have scored (101 in the league) is incredible. 'The record we have here at Anfield this season will play a big part as well. We look forward to next year and whether it be in the league, Champions League or the cup matches it is going to be a difficult place for teams to come, no doubt about that.' Liverpool missed out on a first league title for 24 years by two points and their destiny was in their own hands until the end of April when they lost at home to Chelsea. But the strides made since finishing seventh 12 months ago means the squad are confident they can contend again next season, even with the added demands of the Champions League. 'Nobody would have predicted how far we have come this year. There is a slight disappointment in coming so close and not getting there but we still have a lot to celebrate,' he added. Turnaround: Dwight Gayle scored twice to deny Liverpool a win from three goals in front in a crucial match . Tears: Luis Suarez cried after the Palace draw, but Allen says the team should be pleased with the season . 'I think it shows the belief we have got now. We'd have snapped people's hands off if we had of been offered it before the season, but it has progressed over the year and we realised how good we are as a team and how good the players we have as well. 'We can't become complacent because that is the danger, we will use this to spur us on next season. 'We always felt this season would be an important season to show the ability we have got as a team. 'It's great to have a club like Liverpool back at the top. The beauty of it is there is more to come. That is a great position to be in. 'The players we have got in this team would have experienced so much this season and it will be great going into the next few seasons for the club.'","Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen says qualification is 'reason to celebrate'

"FIFA . President Sepp Blatter has confessed on TV what the rest of the world . already believed - that it was a mistake to award the World Cup to the . boiling desert state of Qatar. But the world’s governing body continue to insist the tournament will still take place in the gulf in 2022 – probably in winter. Twitter blast: Gary Lineker (centre), who leads the BBC World Cup team', has criticised Sepp Blatter . Making his feelings known: Lineker posted several tweets on Blatter's comments on Friday morning . Blatter, who has previously backed the controversial decision to award the World Cup to Qatar despite summer temperatures of 120 degrees, performed his u-turn on Swiss TV channel RTS on Friday. ‘Of course, it was a mistake. You know, one makes a lot of mistakes in life,’ he said. ‘The technical report indicated clearly that it was too hot in summer, but despite that the executive committee decided, with quite a big majority, that the tournament would be in Qatar.’ He also admitted political factors had been a factor in choosing Qatar. ‘I have never said it was bought, but that it was due to political considerations,’ he added. Owning up: FIFA president Sepp Blatter says it was a mistake to award Qatar the 2022 World Cup . England legend Gary Lineker was among . those who hit out at Blatter for making the wrong call and sarcastically . predicted the 78-year-old head of world football would now want to . stand down. Lineker said on Twitter: ‘You have one decision to make . every 4 years! HELP!! Blatter ""everyone makes mistakes."" Pretty big one. He's the man in charge. I imagine his resignation letter is being . composed as we tweet!!! 'Imagine the shock at FIFA HQ when, 2 years after the vote, someone spotted that Qatar's a tad warm in summer. Shadow .

Sepp Blatter saying #Qatar2022 is mistake when during bidding process he . did a good impression of being their campaign manager'. And the winner is: Blatter names Qatar as the winning hosts back in December 2010 . Fifa acted quickly to squash speculation that Blatter’s interview could lead to them taking the tournament away from Qatar. They . put out a statement later in the day saying: ‘As explained in his . answer to the journalist, the president reiterated that the decision to . organize the World Cup in summer was an 'error' based on the technical . assessment report of the bid, which had highlighted the extremely hot . temperatures in summer in Qatar. At no stage did he question Qatar as the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.’ Blatter . himself said it was ‘probable, in fact it’s even more than probable’ the event will be played in winter when temperatures are cooler. Dates . between November 15 and January 15 have been suggested. Blatter’s admission is the latest controversy to hit Qatar since they were awarded the finals in 2010.   In a previous interview, Fifa’s head inspector Harold Mayne-Nicholls said it ‘was not the best option.’ And . Blatter responded to Qatar’s tough laws on homosexuality by joking that . gay people should “refrain from sexual actitities” during the . competition.","The England legend launched a Twitter outburst after Sepp Blatter admitted the mistake .

"It's been a tough two weeks but I'm so glad I've done my time at No 1 Boot Camp. Last week I checked in looking decidedly lumpy – but now I feel fitter, healthier and I've got my six-pack back. I'm also 8lb lighter in less than a week and now weigh in at 12 stone 6lb. Last week I was too ashamed to show my 'before' picture, I'm only putting it out there now because it makes my 'after' look even better. Scroll down for video . Skinny Spencer: Made in Chelsea's Mr Matthews lost 8lb over his two weeks at boot camp . Another three to four days and I reckon I would have got back to my Men's Health peak. but that said I'm happy with where I am. How I did it was not easy – but there is no easy way to lose weight and get in shape. No 1 Boot Camp's resident trainer, former RAF PTI Andy Morris came up with the most fiendish physical torture I've ever had to endure – The Stairway of Doom - 181 steps of pain built into the side of a cliff and I had to run up and down them 10 times, with dumb bells and do exercises at the bottom with the weights. You can see how steep they are in the pictures – and they feel steeper with every journey. They are situated near the picturesque Benirras beach but you don't really feel much like taking in the view. This was agonising muscle pain and a nauseating test of stamina. Toughen up: Spencer took part in a considerable amount of high intensity interval training . Stairway to success: Spencer ran up and down 181 steps 10 times . Time out: Spencer takes a much needed breather from his high intensity workout . Back at the villa there were other special 'games' that Andy had devised. There were boxing work outs in a Tabata style - High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) where I had to hit the pads he was holding for 20 seconds with maximum effort, then 10 seconds rest, then repeat eight times. We repeated this six times in a row totaling around 30 mins. I felt sick with fatigue, was seeing stars and was sucking wind. Apparently this means you are doing it properly. I've got to say I found it easier in the mornings to get motivated and to get some energy by taking a couple of Forza T5 super strength, they also helped me combat hunger pangs in the afternoons. Then there was the burpees challenge. Just for anyone that isn't familiar with a burpee – it is not some unfortunate bit of trapped wind due to indigestion, it is an exercise that has you drop from a standing position to a squat, then push out your legs, bring them back to the squat and then jump back to a standing position. Mind, body, soul: Spencer practices a spot of yoga during the retreat . Getting into the spirit: Spencer attempts some more adventurous moves during yoga . No. 1: Spencer feels far more confident since shaping up . Health hero: Spencer enjoys some quinoa on the beach in Ibiza . The burpee challenge starts off easy and then gets insanely hard. 1st minute – one burpee, 2nd minute – two burpees, and so on until 15th minutes – 15 burpees. By the end you have done 120 burpees. I don't think I would have coped in the mornings to get motivated without taking a couple of Forza T5 super strength, they also helped me combat hunger pangs in the afternoons. Thankfully there were also some gentler pursuits and the Hata yoga around the pool I found particularly relaxing – I attempted the Downward Facing Dog, the Sun salutation, the High plank and the Camel pose. There was also time for a bit of sun-bathing on the beach. Despite the daily torture at the hands of PTI Morris, I've got to say I feel so much better about myself, not just that I look physically better either. There's something really empowering about coming to No 1 Boot Camp and I'll definitely go again. Maybe not for another six months though. All the best, . Spencer xxx . Getting tyred?

"No longer one of the most natural impulses known to humanity, parenting has become fraught with competitiveness, fads and sky-high levels of anxiety. And while it's a common belief that mother knows best, these latest trends and crazes being adopted by parents may make you think again. While some have already hit the UK, others are only just catching on – but all are set to influence how British parents behave in 2015. While you might not actually need to 'eat for two' the new trend of dieting in pregnancy is highly dangerous . One of the most worrying of the looming trends is the so-called 'Final Trimester Flat Belly Diet', spurred on by the increasing pressure new mothers feel to bounce back into their old size after giving birth. Mothers-to-be are refusing the extra 300 calories a day recommended by health professionals and dieting instead so they can get back into a bikini within six weeks. With online guides to slashing your final trimester calorie intake to as low as 1,200 a day, women are existing on green tea and low fat, low carb diets at the one time they should be eating well to nourish their baby. Women are also increasingly willing to work against their natural fertility or 'biological clocks', with more planning to have a baby over the age of 45 and an increase in 'sharenting'. The experience of giving birth is now often immortalised on film and in social media snaps - meaning increasing numbers of women are concern with how they look and even what they are wearing in labour . With one in five women now childless at 40, there's a growing trend for families to 'share' their kids with child-free friends. Encompassing the role of godparent, favourite aunt and babysitter, so-called 'sharenting' lets childless women enjoy the love and benefits of parenthood without the emotional upheaval or expense. But for those women who want their own baby, having offspring later in life looks set to become increasingly common. Poster girls include Oscar winning actress Halle Berry who had her second child at 47 and author Helen Fielding who gave birth to a son at 45 and a daughter at 48. And don't forget the dads – Paul McCartney had daughter Beatrice at 61, while Star Wars supremo George Lucas became a dad at 69. But not all the parenting trends set to hit UK shores are so serious in nature. More and more women, like Halle Berry (left) and Helen Fielding (right) are having children later in life . There is a rise in vanity in the delivery room, with expectant mothers planning fashionable birthing outfits (the most popular include bikini tops with frilled skirts on a string without the knickers), filming their labour and even undergoing full makeovers in the delivery suite. Some of the UK's top hospitals are allowing new mothers to have Botox and blow-dries immediately after birth. The controversial – and highly expensive - packages are only available to those in the know. Gender neutral parenting means no giving your child stereotypical toys . Already popular with celebrities and high flyers who want to look picture perfect post-partum, the trend is set to spread to others as the pressure to appear stunning after labour grows. The ultimate selfie, labour videos inspired by hit TV shows One Born Every Minute chart the stages of labour from the first contractions until the placenta is delivered. To be shared on your child's 18th birthday and online with friends for maximum impact. But the parenting fads don't stop at the maternity ward door. One craze becoming popular is that of  gender neutral parenting, where parents raise their children using only gender-neutral toys, clothes and terms in an effort to removed socialized gender steryotypes. This can become as extreme as refusing to tell the child what sex they are, or families who treat a child as girls one day and boys the next until they discover what 'suits' them. A particularly creepy trend heading over from America is that of 'reborn dolls' of your own children . Costing up to £5,000 each, this expensive trend allows parents to buy dolls made in the exact image of their own child as a newborn. The dolls creators say it's most popular with mothers who are just seeing their youngest child leave the nest,, so they can keep the 'little one' of the family little forever. On a similar thread is the fashion of printing out your child in 3D. As well as parents new love of uploading constant snaps to social media, the newest way to keep hold of happy family memories is to make models of your kids using a 3D printer. The mini-me models can be printed from any digital pic for around £60. With supermarkets now offering an in-store service, expect minifigs of your kids at every stage from newborn to 21st birthday to be one of the fastest growing trends next year. Then, once you have perfectly preserved your gender neutral child in numerous forms, you can begin living ,vicariously through them. Another trend is that of professional level sports for children. Forget egg and spoon races at the local sports day, activities for children are increasingly professional and competitive . Similar to the notorious Little League Baseball in America, leagues for child sports and mini marathons and triathalons for tots are growing. From the rise of competitive running clubs for under tens to buying £2,000 racing bikes for children, over active fathers are increasingly competing through their offspring. From buying £2,000 racing bikes for children, over active dads could be fuelling a health and body image crisis in young kids. The trends were collated by Stork TV, a new online chat show for mothers. Founder Siobhan Freegard, also founder of Netmums said: 'Raising kids can bring out the best – and the worst – in mums. While some of these trends may seem extreme, what was extreme ten years ago is now mainstream. 'The web means wacky ideas catch on fast and there is more pressure than ever before for parents to be perfect.' Mother Beck Laxton decided to bring up her son as gender neutral and spoke on ITV's This Morning to explain why she made this unusual choice and of her experiences in raising Sasha as neither boy or girl until he was five years old. Explaining the concept of being gender nuetral, Beck says: 'It's just not making assumptions about what your kids are going to do or enjoy based on whether they're boys or girls . 'I grew up with feminism so i grew up feeling equal rightswas still something we had to fight for . Beck Laxton made the decision to raise her son as gender neutral for his first five years . 'There are lots of things that girls like that I dont like to make it obvious to me that slotting me into a sterytype just because I'm female is silly.' Beck's decision to raise her son without the influence of gender stereotypes was made before his birth, and began in the delievery room. 'When he was born we asked the nurses not to say wheter Sacha was a boy or a girl and actually it wasnt the first thing we looked for . 'We just sat there holding the baby and didnt feel like we absolutely had to know urgently whether it was a boy or a girl. It didnt seem that important,' she explains. Beck does admit that the reaction of others was oftne confused: 'The midwives did think we were strange. they kept trooping in and out saying ' we do need something to put on our foms, we have got to fill in our forms.' Beck goes on to explain that even when they sent out an email to friends and family to announce the birth, they simply stated they had had a 'baby' and did not specify sex. Despite his unusual start in life, Beck insists Sacha, now eight-years-old, knows he is male. 'He's always know he was a boy. We didn't do it for very long,' she explains. 'We tried to give him lots of different toys. There were lots of dolls around and lots of cars around. At the moment he is only interested in lego. 'The whole point was for him to find his own feet without people saying ""oh boys cant do that.""'

"These nude images of Jackie Kennedy Onassis were taken on a Greek beach in 1972 after her own husband tipped off photographers with her exact location, a new book has claimed. The photographs, which show the former First Lady walking casually along a beach in Skorpios, Greece without a scrap of clothing, were part of a widespread smear campaign by her husband, Greek tycoon Aristotle 'Ari' Onassis, the book claims. The images, which were splashed across magazines and newspapers worldwide, were taken as the couple endured a turbulent marriage fraught with infidelity, absences and family scorn. The revelations come from noted Kennedy author Christopher Andersen in his upcoming book 'The Good Son: JFK Jr. and the Mother He Loved'. Snapped: Images that appeared in Hustler Magazine show Jackie Onassis Kennedy nude on a Greek beach in 1972. It has emerged that the photographers were tipped off by her own husband, Aristotle Onassis . Plot: Tired of Jackie suing the media for invasion of privacy, her husband gave ten photographers detailed maps and time plans of when she would be on the beach in Skorpios, Greece . The biography about Jackie's son describes how Ari bullied his new wife - constantly deriding her as 'The Widow' during interviews, according to an excerpt published by the New York Daily News. Jackie had married Ari in 1968 after he wooed her with gifts and declarations of love - even though her family and friends were never convinced he was the right match for her. Throughout their relationship, Ari pursued his not-so-secret affair with opera singer Maria Callas - while allegedly using his press contacts to publicly humiliate Jackie for stepping out of line. Anderson describes the fatal moment that crushed their relationship in 1972: tired of Jackie suing the media for invasion of privacy, Ari gave ten photographers detailed maps and time plans of when 'The Widow' would be on the beach in Skorpios. Turbulent: He wooed the former First Lady into marriage in 1968 (pictured) but it was rocky from the start . Published: The shots were splashed across magazines, earning Jackie the moniker 'Billion Dollar Bush' Insult: Jackie did not know her own husband was behind the photos and demanded he sue the magazines . The nude shots earned Jackie the moniker 'Billion Dollar Bush', and afforded her children years of cruel bullying. Shocking: The images appeared in a 1975 edition of Hustler after appearing in an Italian publication . Unaware that her husband was behind the cruel plot, she demanded he sue every publication who had printed the photos. Instead, he went to his lawyer and demanded a divorce - although they never actually divorced before his death in 1975. He continued to see Callas right up until he died, with friends noting that she had been the real love of his life, the book excerpt notes. The photograph scandal was the final hit after years of public disputes between Jackie and Ari. From the moment they married, Ari left her alone and upset for two weeks as he jetted around Europe on 'business'. After getting wind of her unhappiness, Ari flew to be by her side for a luxurious three-week vacation - before running back to Callas' side in a bid to woo her too. But when private letters that Jackie wrote to Roswell Gilpatric were exposed in 1970 - including one written days after their wedding - Ari was not quite so ready to support her. 'Dearest Ros,' she had written, 'I would have told you before I left - but then everything happened so much more quickly than I'd planned. 'I saw somewhere what you had said and I was touched - dear Ros - I hope you know all you were and are and will ever be to me - With my love, Jackie.' The book notes: 'Ari didn’t mind being portrayed as an uncouth cretin, a pirate, a dirty old man, or even a crook. But the idea of being cuckolded in public... was a blow to his manhood.' 'His real wife': He started pursuing Callas within weeks of marrying Jackie and kept up the liaison throughout . After the letters emerged, he dined with Callas in public and tipped off photographers that they would be there. He was fully aware that the pictures of him with Callas - 'his real wife' - would be snapped up by US newspapers. Jackie responded by heading to the same restaurant and sitting at exactly the same table to dine with her husband, as a warning to the mistress that she was still in charge. Ari apparently enjoyed the women battling for his affections. He gleefully boasted about his own dalliances, once telling Johhny Meyer: 'Everybody here knows three things about Aristotle Onassis. 'I'm f***ing Maria Callas, I'm f***ing Jacqueline Kennedy - and I'm f***ing rich.' In public: When photographers were about, Onassis played stepfather to John F Kennedy Jr (pictured)","Aristotle Onassis wooed Jackie O with attention and gifts - but after they wed in 1968 he kept up an affair with opera singer Maria Callas .

"A dead bear cub has been found in New York's Central Park Monday morning - and the New York Police Department is investigating it as a case of animal cruelty. The cub was discovered under a bush by a Central Park Conservancy worker about 9.45am, who called 911. The NYPD says it does not know where the bear came from or how it got to Central Park, though the department's animal cruelty unit has been called to investigate the case. Not in its natural habitat: A dead bear cub was found in Central Park, which is surrounded on all sides by dense Manhattan neighborhoods (stock image) The bear, which is about three feet long, was discovered near West Avenue near West 69th Street, just south of Strawberry Fields. It appeared to have a cut on its side and suffered trauma before itself death, police said. Police are still trying to identify the species of bear, noting only that it had 'dark-colored fur.' 'We don't know where it came from or how it got there,' a police spokesman said. Black bears are native to the hills and mountains in New Jersey and New York - though it seems unlikely that a bear could have made it to Central Park, which is surrounded on all sides by dense Manhattan neighborhoods. The Central Park Zoo had a famous depressed polar bear named Gus, who died in August 2013. Zoo officials are currently remodeling Gus' enclosure to make way for a new pair of bear pals - Betty and Veronica - who are moving from the Bronx Zoo.

"ITV World Cup viewers may have to put up with advert breaks during matches after broadcasters were given the chance to cash in on the mid-half water break. Three-minute breaks after 30 minutes of each half will be implemented if the temperature is forecast to be above 32 degrees at kick-off. And the Daily Mirror reports that adverts are set to be screened during this break which will likely infuriate football fans.

"Mal Loye . could barely grasp what he had just heard when Lancashire team-mate Lou . Vincent offered him £10,000 one day in 2008 to get out for fewer than 10 . in a Twenty20 game the following afternoon against Durham. A . chat with his mum that night helped crystallise his reasons for saying . no. 'I said: ""Mum, I don't think I'd even do it for 100, 200, 300 . grand"",' Loye told Sportsmail. 'Ultimately, it's about looking your . parents in the eye. They'd given all their time for me to play sport as a . kid. That was the thing - not the money.' Next . day, a few hours before the start of the match, Loye was warming up in . the nets when Vincent upped the offer. 'He said: ""Look, the money's . double - £20,000."" I just gave him a definite no. I said: ""Louey, I . don't want any part of it"". I had too much respect for the game.' Speaking out: Mal Loye says players offered bribes must tell bosses . The . 41-year-old Loye, who played seven one-day internationals for England in . early 2007, quit the game four years later and now coaches at . Wellingborough School in Northamptonshire, told no-one about Vincent's . approach other than his mum, his then girlfriend and a couple of mates, . who advised him to put it out of his mind and get on with his career. He . did precisely that, without ever feeling entirely comfortable - until . he was contacted out of the blue by the ECB's anti-corruption unit last . year, then interviewed by police. The . immediate feeling was relief. And, now that Vincent's testimony to the . ICC's own anti-corruption officials has been laid bare, Loye feels able . to talk in detail for the first time about the day, six years ago, that . threatened to turn his life upside down. Hitting out: Mal Loye in that 2008 Twenty20 game for Lancashire against Durham . India's Supreme Court has ordered a full investigation into corruption in the Indian Premier League, including the role of Narayanaswami Srinivasan, the suspended president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. It follows an initial probe by a three-member team headed by retired judge Justice Mukul Mudgal that found Chennai Super Kings team principal and Srinivasan's sonin- law Gurunath Meiyappan guilty of being in contact with illegal bookmakers. The panel has been asked to submit its report by the end of August. 'I was a . target, a victim,' he said. 'I was in a no-win situation and I still am. I don't deserve it. I didn't deserve it. I put my heart and soul into . cricket, and it wasn't to be associated with this. I take no . satisfaction out of talking to the police last year but, in a weird way, . it was a bit of a relief. I tackled a major problem deep within my . psyche, and it all came out. I broke down just talking about it.' It . was not the first time Loye's unwanted brush with cricket's underworld . had reduced him to tears. Watching the highlights of the . Lancashire-Durham game that night at home, the stress of the day washed . over him. 'It was the only time I'd watched the game until the ECB . officers showed it me again last year.' Loye's . memories of the match remain strikingly vivid, despite the fact that, . by his own admission, he had spent the five years until spring 2013, . when the ECB contacted him, repressing the experience. Spotlight: Loye was contacted out of the blue by the ECB's anti-corruption unit last year . 'There . were two awkward situations that day which will always live with me,' he . said. 'We batted first and I was getting my pads on, clear in my mind . that I'd never been so determined in my life to get to 10.Before Lou and . I walked out to open the batting, I turned, fully padded up, to look at . my team-mates, who were pumped up and ready to go. It was a big, big . game for us, and I felt this guilt towards them that I'd never felt . before. It was the first time it hit me. 'As . we walked out to open together, I wasn't 100 per cent sure that Lou . would be up to something, but I knew after the first over. That was the . other awkward situation. 'We met in the middle after it had been bowled, and Louey just said: ""You know what I've got to do."" 'To . get through that day - then the whole thing came flooding back watching . the highlights that evening on Sky. That was the breakdown. And then I . moved on.' Failing to . report an approach was not the misdemeanour in 2008 that it is now, and . Loye attempted to rationalise Vincent's behaviour by putting it partly . down to his struggles with depression. But he suspects now that Vincent . targeted him because he was going through problems of his own, of a . personal nature at home, and with his testimonial  season, at a time . when the recession meant people were keeping their hands in their . pockets. 'The . only time I felt angry with Louey was when it hit me that he probably . knew how vulnerable I was,' said Loye. 'It was my naivety. I genuinely . thought he was trying to do me a favour.' Against . Durham, in one of three county games now under the ICC's scanner, . Vincent fulfilled his side of the Faustian pact, steering Shaun Pollock . towards a second slip to depart for one from five balls. 'It was . brilliant how he did it,' remembered Loye, who went on to smash 53 from . 37 deliveries, ending for ever the possibility that anyone might one . day conclude he had been tempted by Vincent's offer. Dark hour: New Zealander Lou Vincent (front) has made allegations of corruption in the county game . He said: 'It's one reason why I'd like to speak to Louey now. If I'd nicked off for less than 10, where would that have put me? 'Everyone would have looked at me in a completely different light.' Why does he think Vincent got involved? 'He probably got himself into a serious hole. 'My gut feeling is that he was quite angry with the game, which was financially not as rewarding as other sports.' Out of line: Vincent threw his wicket in matches but on this occasion against Lancashire in a T20 quarter-final, defied his paymasters . What advice would Loye now offer a cricketer who received a similar approach? 'I put it out of my head,' he said. 'Yet here we are, six years down the line, and it's out there. 'As . soon as you get approached, you tell someone - and tell the right . people. Those right people have to be made clear to the players. 'The . Professional Cricketers' Association are doing a great job, and the ECB . were brilliant with me, but I still think the counties could do more.'","Playing for Lancashire in 2008, Loye was offered bribe to score fewer than 10 runs against Durham in Twenty20 match .

"Peter Crouch has backed Wayne Rooney to finally live up to his World Cup hype now that England are not considered a one-man team. The England striker has flopped in his two previous trips to the sport’s biggest event, failing to score in Germany in 2006 or South Africa four years ago. Emphasis has since been placed on the emerging talents of Ross Barkley, Raheem Sterling and Adam Lallana ahead of the World Cup in Brazil and Crouch, who was part of England’s squads for both tournaments, expects Rooney to flourish in the shadows. Main man: Wayne Rooney will be England's star at this summer's World Cup, claims Peter Crouch . ‘The last two World Cups have been all about if Rooney stays fit then we are going to win it,’ the Stoke City striker said. ‘The pressure was ridiculous on him. ‘But now we have other players in the squad - I can’t even remember Rooney being mentioned too much in the lead up to this World Cup. ‘I think taking a bit of pressure of him and letting him enjoy his football can only be a good thing.’ Crouch was on the fringes of contention to appear at a third World Cup, having scored 22 goals for England in 42 appearances. But he admitted he had no issues with being overlooked by Roy Hodgson and went on to endorse the selection of an inexperienced squad, claiming the lack of scars from previous campaigns would be beneficial. He said: ‘I called which strikers would go (Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert) weeks ago as I felt they were the ones who are the most in-form. All four of them deserve to go. All smiles: Stoke City striker Crouch had a formidable record in front of goal for the Three Lions . What a duo! Rooney and Crouch teamed up together for England during the 2006 World Cup . ‘My advice to any of the lads going to their first World Cup would be to go and enjoy it and take it all in if you can. It can be a blur. ‘People are watching every single game at the World Cup and you are under the microscope. ‘What is good about the squad at the minute is there are a lot of young players and it is a bit different. Hopefully they will go into the tournament with less fear and enjoy it.’ The 33-year-old added: ‘I think Sturridge can light up the tournament. He’s had an unbelievable season. Those Liverpool players, especially Sturridge and Sterling, seem to be playing with so much freedom. ‘I do think the lack of experience can help the players. I genuinely do believe that. They do not know what to expect and will go out there and continue what they have been doing this season. ‘They won’t have respect for people and just go out there and do what they know they can do. It will certainly benefit us.’","Rooney will be key for Roy Hodgson's side at the World Cup .

"Wind turbines are often bemoaned for their unsightly appearance, noise and danger to local wildlife - but what if we put them underwater? That’s exactly what Caithness-based company MeyGen, owned by Atlantis Resources Ltd, plan to do with their initial £51m ($82m) underwater turbine project. By the end of the year they plan to install turbines off the Scottish coast and they say the technology could be used as a more environmentally friendly source of green energy in future. Scroll down for video . Caithness company MeyGen are planning to place turbines underwater (illustration shown). By the end of the year they will begin the project at Pentland Firth, Scotland . The location of the turbines will be Pentland Firth, home to some of the fastest flowing marine waters in the world at 18 miles an hour. It’s thought that harnessing its energetic waters could power up to a third of Scotland. The turbines will be lined up 525ft (160 metres) apart, weighted down by scrap metal. As the water depth in the Pentland Firth is about 130ft (40 metres), small craft will be able to sail over the area of about four square miles (10.4 square kilometres) without fear of hitting them. When complete in 2020, the Pentland Firth project will generate enough electricity for 400,000 homes. There are further plans to exploit the Pentland Firth over the next two decades, installing 1,000 turbines that will generate 1.6 gigawatts of energy, enough for more than a million homes. Because the waters are so rough, little fishing takes place and there is no danger to fish life as the blades revolve so slowly. The turbine farm, which will be clearly marked on charts, is well away from sensitive military areas where Royal Navy submarines operate. The first turbines are set to be placed at the turn of the new year, with more being placed over the next few years. Unlike wind turbines, underwater turbines would never be ‘off’ as there is a constant flow of water. MeyGen’s turbines are slightly smaller than their land counterparts but generate a similar amount of electricity a year - about one megawatt - and the company plans to eventually build several hundred. This would be enough to power 175,000 homes. They rotate 12 to 14 times a minute, while compared to regular wind turbines they are slightly more ‘stubby’ with smaller blades. Speaking to MailOnline, Meygen CEO Dan Pearson said he hoped Phase 1 of construction would be completed by the end of 2016. He explained that the turbines will be about 0.9 miles (1.5km) from the shore and they will be ‘on a par with wind turbines' in terms of their productivity. ‘The costs are higher but this is brand new technology,’ he adds. ‘We have to make it work first.’ Pentland Firth is home to some of the fastest flowing marine waters in the world. However, because the waters are so rough, little fishing takes place and there is no danger to fish life as the blades revolve so slowly . Meygen's technology (shown) is not entirely new, but its location is an innovative way to use tidal power, using the relatively uninhabited area of Pentland Firth to provide cheap and clean energy to the UK National Grid . Mr Pearson is also adamant there won’t be significant danger to nearby marine life. And MeyGen’s project will be in quite shallow water, meaning the turbines can be dropped down by a crane. By the early 2020s they want to deploy up to 398 megawatts of offshore tidal stream turbines for the UK National Grid. And there are further plans to exploit the Pentland Firth over the next two decades, installing 1,000 turbines that will generate 1.6 gigawatts of energy, enough for more than a million homes. Each turbine (shown being lowered) is about as productive as a wind turbine, if not more. As they are underwater the water always flows and they are never 'off'. Cost will be higher but CEO Dan Pearson tells MailOnline this will reduce. By the 2020s they could have enough to power a third of Scotland.","Caithness company MeyGen are planning to place turbines underwater .

"A woman who struggled with obesity for almost 20 years has finally shed half her body weight - so that she will be around to watch her nephews grow up. And Canadian Alison Fox - who didn't go on dates until her mid-twenties because of her weight - finally got the confidence to take the leap after moving to UK and getting her first ever boyfriend, who was there to hold her hand as she joined a fit club. The 27 year old, who now lives in Nottingham, first considered trying to get fit after watching her beloved aunt, who had always been overweight, passed away at just 53 years old in 2009. Scroll down for video . At her heaviest, Alison tipped the scales at 21 stone 2lbs. The death of an overweight aunt and the birth of two nephews made her want to overhaul her diet, but the 27-year-old didn't have the confidence until she met her first boyfriend . But it wasn't until her youngest nephew was born in late 2012 that she finally mustered the courage to take the leap and go on a diet, after promising herself that she would live to see him live into adulthood. After joining WeightWatchers in 2013, she has lost more than ten stone, going from 21 stone 2lbs to her current weight of 10 stone 6lbs. Alison has always struggled with her weight, from the age of nine she was teased at school in Ontario, Canada, and had to move schools when the bullying got too bad. She spent her teenage years feeling down constantly, last to be picked for the school sports team and never asked out on dates. She lived within a destructive cycle - as her self-esteem plummeted and her weight continued to increase. But Alison was given a wake-up call on her health in December 2009, when her aunt, who had always been overweight, passed away at just 53 years old. In 18 months, Alison has lost half her body weight and is now 10 stone 6lbs . Soon after, she became an aunt herself and was tormented with the idea that her weight could mean she never saw her nephew grow up. The shock wasn't enough though, and in 2011, a permanent move to the UK and the arrival of her first ever boyfriend saw her put on even more weight. Then in 2012, Alison's youngest nephew was born and on a Christmas trip back to her hometown of Ontario, she made a promise to herself to stay healthy for her nephews so that she can be around as long as possible for them. On her return to the UK, her disgust at her body shape meant she couldn't even look back at the family photos taken on her holiday. On March 9, 2013, she signed up to her local Weight Watchers meeting in Nottingham. After years of being bullied, Alison's fear of being mocked for her size left her unable to enter the room - but it was her boyfriend's promise to stay by her side and hold her hand through the ordeal that helped her to go through the first meeting. Alison loves her new active lifestyle after losing the weight. She said: 'I have bags more energy, I never hit the 2pm slump I always used to hit during the day and can easily climb numerous flights of stairs without getting out of breath' She has attended a weekly meeting ever since and last week, reached her goal weight of 10 stone 7lbs. Alison said: 'Losing weight has changed my life, I’m so much more confident and able to assert myself more. 'It makes me sad to think that I was this under confident, overweight girl for so long, I wish I’d done it sooner. 'I have bags more energy, I never hit the 2pm slump I always used to hit during the day and can easily climb numerous flights of stairs without getting out of breath. 'Each time I return home to Canada, my family don’t recognise me – they can’t believe how far I’ve come. 'The best thing of all is knowing that I can be there for my three young nephews and play games with them without getting out of breath. 'It’s amazing to see the look on their faces when I jump and run around with them, my youngest nephew even commented: “You’re different, Aunt Alison”, and I really am! 'When I reached goal yesterday my family were there with me in the meeting via Skype on my phone – they can’t believe it’s me on the other end of the screen.'","Alison Fox, 27, never went on a date in school because of her size .

"A funeral is planned in North Carolina for the daughter of a slave who had a complicated relationship with the Confederacy. The Saturday service for 91-year-old Mattie Clyburn Rice is being arranged by a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. A color guard of Confederate re-enactors will attend the service as will members of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, to which Rice belonged. This Saturday, Dec. 8, 2012 photo, shows Mattie Rice, 91, the daughter of Confederate soldier Weary Clyburn, who died in September 2014 . Rice's father, Weary Clyburn of Lancaster County, South Carolina, went to the Civil War with his master, saved the man's life and drew a pension for his wartime service. Yet pension records also show he was not considered a Confederate soldier. Historians say the idea of a 'black Confederate' soldier is a myth, yet Clyburn's story illustrates the tangled threads of Confederate history. The Saturday service for 91-year-old Mattie Clyburn Rice is being arranged by a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans . The Charlotte Observer reports that Rice helped get Union County to recognize not only her father's service but that of nine other local black men in 2012. All but one of those men were slaves. A marker acknowledging their service at the Old County Courthouse is the only one like it in the U.S. to honor black men who worked for the Confederacy, though it may have been against their will. 'She absolutely adored her father and she wanted his story told,' her daughter, Valeria Hall Frazier, told reporters. 'She wanted so much for that (marker) to happen.'","Mattie Rice Clyburn, 91, will be buried this Saturday .

"An Oklahoma inmate was sentenced on Friday to three life prison terms without parole in the killings of two girls and his fiancee, but his punishment was delayed about an hour because he attacked one of his defense attorneys with a razor blade. Kevin Sweat cut attorney Peter Astor, causing a minor neck wound, said Okfuskee County District Attorney Max Cook. It's not clear how the 28-year-old convicted killer smuggled the weapon into the courthouse in Okemah, about 65 miles south of Tulsa. Sweat, who sustained an injury to his nose, was brought back into the packed courtroom and sentenced in front of dozens of family members and friends of his three victims.

Shot to death: Murder victims 11-year-old Skyla Whitaker, left photo, and 13-year-old Taylor Placker, right photo were shot by Kevin Sweat in 2008 . 'Today is judgment day,' Judge Lawrence Parish told Sweat, who was wearing a bulletproof vest over his rumpled orange jail uniform. Before being sentenced, Sweat told the judge that he wanted to withdraw the three guilty pleas he made in July when he admitted he shot 11-year-old Skyla Whitaker and 13-year-old Taylor Paschal-Placker in 2008 as the girls walked down a road near Weleetka in eastern Oklahoma. He also admitted slaying his fiancee, 23-year-old Ashley Taylor, in 2011. Parish refused to let Sweat take back the guilty pleas, but set a hearing next month regarding the request. People in the courtroom applauded as Parish read out each of the life prison terms. Prosecutors and Sweat's attorneys had previously agreed to allow Sweat to waive his right to a jury trial, sparing him a possible death sentence.

'The pain is always going to be there, and that's something you can't take away.' Peter Placker — who found the bodies of his granddaughter, Taylor Paschal-Placker, and Skyla Whitaker in a ditch — left the courthouse without speaking, his head held low. Wanda Mankin, principal at the school where the girls were students, attended the sentencing. 'Now he can't do this to someone else,' said Mankin, who sat in the back row in the courtroom. The ground was hardly disturbed Friday at a memorial near the patch of backcountry road where the girls' remains were discovered. Only a couple of cars passed by.

"Northampton produced a mighty finale to topple arch-rivals Leicester in a thundering Premiership semi-final on Friday night. A try two minutes from time by England flanker Tom Wood gave Northampton a Twickenham final later this month after Leicester had led 17-6 at half-time. Northampton did it the hard way after they had prop Salesi Ma’afu sent off for flooring  England hooker Tom Youngs 17 minutes into the second half. Wood, who crashed over wide out on the left, sent Northampton’s fans delirious as their team ended a four-year period without a win over champions Leicester. Late blow: Tom Wood scores the match-winning try in the semi-final for Northampton over Leicester . Elation: Saints celebrate as they take the lead for the first time in the match to win through to the final . Northampton: Foden; Collins (Mercey 58), George Pisi (Wilson 67), Burrell, North; . Myler, Fotouali’i; Alex Waller (Corbisiero 52), Haywood, Ma’afu, Manoa, . Lawes, Wood, Dowson (capt) (Clark 52), Dickinson (Fotuali’i 63). Sent off: Ma’afu 57. Tries: North, Wood . Penalties: Myler (3) Conversions: Myler . Leicester: . Tait (Mafi 61); Morris, Tuilagi, Bowden, Goneva; Flood (Williams 63), . Ben Youngs; Ayerza, Tom Youngs, Mulipola, Deacon, Slater (capt), Gibson . (Briggs 58), Salvi, Crane. Sin bin: Goneva 29, Bowden 46, Tom Youngs 57. Tries: Tuilagi, Youngs . Pens: Flood, Williams Conversions: Flood (2) Referee: JP Doyle. Attendance: 13,591 . ‘That was the most intense match I’ve . ever played in,’ he said afterwards. ‘We left it late but we got the job . done. That was a proper game. It was so physical and credit to the . Leicester lads for making it as hard as it was.’ The . last-gasp victory was  delivered by 14 men after Ma’afu was dismissed . in brawl which also brought a yellow card for Youngs from referee JP . Doyle. Youngs was one of . three Leicester players to be sin binned and their director of rugby . Richard Cockerill admitted his team’s lack of discipline cost them. ‘The . penalty count speaks for itself,’ he said. ‘It was nearly double . theirs. The indiscipline cost us. Dan’s yellow card gave them the . impetus and we could not get out of our own half.’ Jim . Mallinder, Northampton’s director of rugby, said: ‘I think we deserved . it. We were down at half-time but we kept moving their front five around . and to turn it around was a massive testament to the character of the . side.’ These two . arch-rivals would have a fierce tussle even if the only thing at stake . was local bragging rights. Over the past five years these contests, . dominated by Leicester’s success, have become hugely intense, heightened . by the large number of England players involved. Head-to-head: Saints prop Salesi Ma'afu and hooker Tom Youngs face off after a clash on the ground . Over the top: Ma'afu delivers an overhand left onto Youngs' chin, that gets him sent off . Crunch: Youngs is powerless as powerful Ma'afu clocks him on the chin . Off: Referee JP Doyle is given no choice but to show Ma'afu a red card, meaning he'll miss the final . Manu . Tuilagi has spent most of the season watching the rise of Northampton’s . Luther Burrell while the Leicester centre recovered from a torn . pectoral muscle. He had already rocked Burrell backwards in the move . which led to him finishing off a smart attack which put Leicester in . charge. Mat Tait’s half . break, which was followed by him gaining valuable metres on the floor, . cracked open the Northampton line, allowing fly half Toby Flood to work a . big overlap on the right. Flood kicked the conversion to add to his seventh-minute kick which had put Leicester in front. Stephen . Myler equalised in the 21st minute as Northampton enjoyed their best . period of the half thanks to the inventiveness of scrum-half Kahn . Fotuali’i. His running power had helped earn the penalty by catching out the Leicester defence as they trundled backwards. In the same period, a try by Phil Dowson was ruled out by the referee for a dummy jump before the ball was thrown in. Walkover: Leicester's Manu Tuilagi celebrates scoring the first try of the semi-final against Northampton . Breakthrough: England centre Tuilagi get the final touch on a slick backline move for the Tigers . Try-saver: Saints Kahn Fotuali'i is cut down short of the try line by an outstanding Matthew Tait tackle . The . disallowed try looked to be a crucial turning point as, apart from . another kick by Myler following a sin bin offence for Goneva in the 29th . minute, the rest of the half went Leicester’s way. After . Tuilagi had nimbly finished off for the opening try, Leicester’s second . came from blunt forward power. Prop Logovi’i Mulipola stormed forward . off a line-out and Leicester camped on the Northampton line. Ben Youngs, . who needs no second invitation to use his pace and power, darted over. Flood . added the conversion and Leicester turned round 17-6 and looked in . control. But Northampton came out swinging and, despite the loss of . Ma’afu for his punching of Youngs, the home team dominated the half. Away fans: Tigers' travelling supporters show their approval of their team's efforts early in the match . All-in: A melee breaks out on the sideline in a predictably spirited affair between the old rivals . A . third penalty from Myler in the 46th minute rewarded early pressure in . the half before the match exploded when Ma’afu and Youngs traded blows. Northampton kept on the pressure and worked North over for a try in the . 65th off a well-executed move. Myler converted to cut Leicester’s . deficit to 16-17. Owen Williams, who had replaced Toby Flood, edged Leicester further ahead at 20-16 thanks to a 65th-minute penalty. But . Northampton returned to the attack and the pressure eventually forced . Leicester’s defence to crack when Wood finished on the left. Myler, who . had contributed 11 points, missed the conversion but the one-point . advantage was enough to seal a famous win.

"Brendan Rodgers thanked Luis Suarez for making him a better manager as he collected the Football Writers' Association's Player of the Year award on behalf of the rehabilitated Liverpool striker. After an exceptional season, the 27-year-old topped the poll of 300-plus journalists ahead of team-mate Steven Gerrard. Suarez netted 31 goals in a remarkable campaign that not only saw Liverpool come agonisingly close to a first league title in 24 years but saw the striker put the negative headlines of the past behind him. VIDEO Scroll down for Luis Suarez and wife send message to fans after winning PFA award . Working together: Rodgers said coaching Suarez had allowed him to become a better manager . Goal machine: Suarez scored 31 times this season for Liverpool, the most in the league . The Uruguayan received just two votes in last year's FWA poll and has come full circle since serving a 10-match ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. Suarez, who was also named the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year, was unable to pick up the award on Thursday due to a pre-World Cup break, so Liverpool boss Rodgers instead accepted the award. 'On behalf of Luis and all of Liverpool Football Club's staff, we want to say a big thank you to the Football Writers' Association,' he said at the London Lancaster Hotel. 'I think everybody knows the struggles he had in the last year. It has been incredibly difficult for him. 'But rehabilitation is always respected in the country - people who want to change for the better and he is certainly someone that was at a real low point at the end of the last season. Clean sweep: The striker added the FWA Footballer of the Year award to his golden boot and PFA gong . Finish: Suarez's goals took Liverpool to the brink of the Premier League title, before they lost out to Man City . 'I know that better than anyone. It was a real, real difficult period for him but he went away and, after a difficult summer, the power of Liverpool and the club that it is convinced him to stay. 'Once we got the season under way, he concentrated on his football and we've had a number of outstanding players this season but Luis Suarez has been incredible.' Rodgers used the speech to thank former manager Kenny Dalglish for signing Suarez, Liverpool's communication team and managing director Ian Ayre. First and foremost in the Reds boss' praise, though, was Suarez, whose performances this season saw them come so close to the title. 'When I came into Liverpool as manager, Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard said to me this was the best player that they had played with,' Rodgers added. 'I thought about those two and all the great players they've played with in their career, so I was really interested to see what his play was like close up. 'For me, he has challenged me every day of my life, he's done everything that you would need to do at the top level of the game as a player. Infamous: The Liverpool striker's reputation was in tatters when he bit Branislav Ivanovic last season . Tears: Failing to win the title will haunt Suarez, but he has been the best player in the league all year . 'He is a winner, his determination is unique, he is absolutely relentless. He is someone that trains every single day of his life - he doesn't look for an excuse. 'And what people don't see is that he is a very intelligent man. He is a winner when he crosses the line, but with great intelligence. 'For a young manager like myself coming into a club like Liverpool, I understand the pressures of the club and those pressures include everything that involves managing top players. 'I know for however long I am at Liverpool, whenever I leave I will have become a better manager and a better person because of Luis Suarez and for that I thank him so much.' Suarez was also praised on stage by Football Association chairman Greg Dyke and FWA chairman Andy Dunn of the Sunday Mirror. 'There are some members that remind quite frequently that in the citation for this award that it mentions he is Footballer of the Year by 'precept and by example',' the latter said. Example: Suarez has earned the award because of his incredible performances and improved behaviour . 'Now that part of the citation is important, but I do think what better example is there of someone who maybe realised that they did have issues to address on the field of play and has addressed those issues? 'I think Luis Suarez has done that and I think that is why he fulfills that criteria. 'And, of course, there is that bit that says 'Footballer of the Year' and what a footballer he is, what a footballer we've had the privilege to watch, particularly this season.'","Uruguayan forward Suarez wins FWA Footballer of the Year award .

"Arsenal vice-captain Mikel Arteta has hit back at Jose Mourinho for the ‘specialist in failure’ jibe he aimed at Arsene Wenger. Ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup final against Hull, Arteta strongly defended the Arsenal manager and insisted the Chelsea boss’s scathing comments in February were baseless. ‘If you analyse everything he has done for this club, if he is a failure — I have a different opinion. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose bites back: Wenger is a specialist in failure . Defensive midfielder: Arteta has spoken out in defense of his manager Arsene Wenger . Specialist in failure: Mourinho has criticised Wenger this season, but Arsenal could have the last laugh . ‘I don’t like it when someone criticises any of my team-mates, the staff, the manager, the club. ‘When they are right, maybe you can accept that everybody makes mistakes. But when he (Mourinho) comes in a certain way, I don’t like it. We don’t need to answer to anybody.’ However, Arteta has questioned Arsenal’s policy of offering only 12-month contracts to players over 30. The 32-year-old, who will discuss his future with Wenger after the final, has a year left on his contract but was not part of the renewal drive that led to Per Mertesacker, Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and Laurent Koscielny signing new deals. Arteta said: ‘I don’t value players by age, whether it is Tomas Rosicky or Jack Wilshere. ‘I analyse many other things before age. For the club, age can be an asset. For me, a much bigger asset is someone who has played over 125 games in three years, compared to someone who has played 25 and is 20. Worrying times: Arsene Wenger has come under pressure for Arsenal's nine-year trophy drought . Age doesn't matter: Arteta says he judges the likes of Rosicky and Wilshere the same, despite age differences . ‘I understand the club’s point of view: “Mikel is not a £25million player because he is not 22 any more”. But I know what I can give.’ Meanwhile, Samuel Eto’o has called time on his career at Chelsea after labelling Mourinho a ‘fool’ for a  jibe about his age. In February, Mourinho was filmed by French TV saying: ‘Eto’o is 32 years old, maybe 35, who knows?’ Mocking: Eto'o reacted to his manager's suggestion that he is old by using the corner flag as a walking stick .

"A widower who lost his wife to Alzheimer's 72 years after their first kiss has touched hearts across Britain by penning a moving poem in her memory. Bob Lowe, 93, from Barton-on-Sea in Hampshire, described the deep loneliness he has felt since his wife Kath died three years ago in his work Ode to Kath. Their relationship survived the Second World War and they were together for six more decades. But the terrible disease took its toll in her later years, until one day she asked him: 'Where's Bob?' Scroll down for video . Widower Bob, 93, with one of the last pictures of the couple together before wife Kath passed away in 2011 . Happy days: Bob and Kathleen Lowe, pictured on their wedding day in 1946, were married for 65 years . One of the last picture of Bob and Kathleen Lowe, from Hampshire, before she passed away three years ago . I am alone, now I know it's true . There was a time when we were two . Those were the days when we would chat . Doing little jobs of this and that . We'd go to the shops and select our meals . But now I'm one I know how it feels . To try and cook or have meals on wheels . The rooms are empty there's not a sound . Sometimes I'm lost and wander round . To look for jobs that I can do . To bring back the days when we were two . When darkness falls and curtains drawn . That's when I feel most forlorn . But I must be honest and tell the truth . I'm not quite alone and here's the proof . Because beside me in her chair . She quietly waits our time to share . Kath said to me some time ago . Darling when the time comes for us to go . Let's mix our ashes and be together . So we can snuggle up for ever and ever. Ode to Kath begins with the words: 'I am alone, now I know it's true. There was a time when we were two.' The poem prompted an instant outpouring of support yesterday after Bob read out his work on BBC Radio 4 and 5 Live to raise awareness of a loneliness helpline. BBC bosses said they had responses from across the world from listeners who said the poem made them realise they were not alone. Radio 5 live Breakfast Editor Gill Farrington told MailOnline: 'It's extremely rare for an interview to touch the hearts of so many people. 'Bob's poem to his late wife in particular struck a chord with listeners. Many were moved to tears. 'We've been overwhelmed by reaction from across the world since. People have wanted to share their experiences saying Bob's poem had made them realise they were not alone in their loneliness and grief. 'It was a privilege to speak to him.' One Twitter user, @welshflier, wrote after the reading yesterday: 'Bob Lowe's matter-of-factness about old-age loneliness makes it more heartbreaking. Now cooking breakfast while crying.' Another, Miles Evans, said: 'Don't often well up but Bob Lowe just made me. What a legend. Heartbreaking and spirit soaring at the same time'. Bob and Kath met in 1937 but were separated when the Second World War broke out in 1939. Despite the distance, they sent each other love notes and photographs and Bob proposed to his love while he was on active service. They wed in 1946 upon his return and a friend who worked for Kodak recorded their wedding video in colour. They went on to have two daughters and a son. Bob said: 'Well, you're going back to 1937, I met my Kath. She was lovely. 'One of the guys said to me ""Hey, she fancies you"" and I said ""Well I certainly fancy her"". 'Unfortunately in 1939, the war separated us, but while I was over there I thought I need to write to her and ask her to marry me. To hear the full poem, click here. Pictured in 1980, Bob and Kath had two daughters and a son together. Bob said: 'Family life was a happy life' Diamond couple: Bob and Kath Lowe, pictured in 2006, celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary . 'Family life in those days was a happy life.' After six decades together, she her memory began to fade. Her husband raised the alarm with doctors after she failed to recognise him one night and she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. He said: 'One evening she turned around and and she looked at me and she said ""Where's Bob?"" and I said ""I'm Bob"". 'The bottom dropped out of my world then. The doctors said she was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. 'As she got worse it became more difficult to nurse her but she stayed here until the end. 'And eventually she passed away at one o'clock in the morning by my side. 'I couldn't believe it. She had gone. It was impossible to say goodbye or ""I love you"" any more.' Bob is now a community champion forThe Silver Line, a helpline for older people suffering from loneliness, which was started by Esther Rantzen. Outpouring: Twitter users showed support for Mr Lowe, saying his down-to-earth reading made them well up . He wrote a letter to the TV presenter after reading a newspaper article she wrote on loneliness and inspired her with the poem dedicated to his beloved wife. It said: 'My wife died three months ago after 65 years of marriage but more to the point 72 years since we first kissed…and she waited throughout the war for me and I for her… loneliness tell me about it.' Bob has also spoken movingly about his experiences to guests at The Silver Line national launch event in December last year. A rising number of men are facing loneliness in their old age. Charity Independent Age and the International Longevity Centre have said the number of older men living on their own is expected to increase by 65 per cent in the next 16 years. Widower Bob holds a picture of his wedding from 1946. His Ode to Kath begins: 'I am alone, now I know it's true . Left, Bob, and right, Kathleen, pictured in 1945, sent each other photographs while they were separated during the war. He said: 'But while I was over there I thought I need to write to her and ask her to marry me' Kath waited for Bob were married after he returned from war. 'She waited throughout the war for me and I for he,' said Bob . Esther Rantzen, The Silver Line founder, said: 'The truth about older people is that many of them have led long and fascinating lives but often feel that nobody is interested in their experiences. 'So they are reluctant to talk about it and more than half of callers to The Silver Line callers tell us they have no one to speak to at all apart from The Silver Line. 'Becoming a Silver Line Friend is an immensely rewarding and enjoyable thing to do, and our volunteers tell us they get as much out of the conversations as the older people they chat to.' The Silver Line Helpline, launched across the UK last November, following a grant from the Big Lottery, has already taken more than 230,000 calls from older people.

"Out: Michael Campbell has withdrawn from US Open . Michael Campbell has announced he will not return to the scene of his US Open triumph at Pinehurst next month after separating from his wife. Campbell, who held off Tiger Woods to win his first major title in 2005, said he is not 'mentally ready' to play competitive golf and will also miss next week's BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. In a statement on his personal website, the 45-year-old wrote: 'Sorry I have been off the radar since playing at the 2014 Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship. 'I have had some problems with a tendon in my left ankle that stopped me from playing for two to three months. The good news is that I am back swinging and now managing to play 18 holes. "" 'In a personal note, I have some sad news. Unfortunately Julie and I have separated. Our children remain our number one focus as we move forwards - as parents first and foremost while remaining both friends and business partners. End of the road: Campbell has split with his separated from his wife Julie - pictured here together in 2005 . 'As I do not feel that I am either fully physically or mentally ready to play tournament golf at the highest level, after much deliberation I have decided not to play in the BMW PGA Championship, the US Open or the events in between. I want to get back to my best and I believe this is the best strategy to achieve this. 'I look forward to seeing you all out on the course later in the summer!' Campbell's victory at Pinehurst made him the first New Zealander to win a major since Bob Charles in 1963, with his country's parliament suspended in order to watch the drama unfold in the final round. He also beat Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley in the final of the World Match Play Championship at Wentworth later that year, but has not won since and made just five cuts on the European Tour last season.","Michael Campbell says he is not 'mentally ready' to play competitive golf .

"Australian doctors have successfully brought three dead hearts back to life and transplanted them into patients in a world-first operation. The doctors at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney used a preservation solution developed with the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute to transplant the organs into 57-year-old Michelle Gribilas, 44-year-old Jan Damen and a third patient still in recovery. One of the hearts had stopped beating for 20 minutes before it was brought back to life, placed on a machine and injected with the preservation solution. Scroll down for video . Carpenter Jan Damen, 44, (pictured with his wife Silvana) received a transplant from a dead heart that was brought back to life . The first two patients to receive the ground-breaking transplants (Michelle Gribilas, left, and Mr Damen, centre) speak with surgeon Kumud Dhital . The hospital believes 30 percent more lives will be saved thanks to the solution, which reduces the amount of damage to the heart and makes it more resilient to transplantation. Before these operations, heart surgeons have only been able to use donor hearts from 100 percent brain-dead patients, but now the donor pool will be expanded significantly. The solution, which took 12 years to develop, also improves the function of the hearts donated after circulatory death (DCD) when they are restarted. Ms Gribilas, who is retired and lives in Campsie in southwest Sydney, said she is a 'different person altogether' after receiving her transplant. 'I had the transplant a couple of months ago and I was very sick before I had it,' she said. 'Now I feel wonderful.  I walk three kilometres a day.' Mr Damen, a father of three girls including an eight-year-old and six-year-old twins, worked as a carpenter and lives on the Northern Beaches with his daughters and wife Silvana. He is still recovering at the hospital. 'I feel amazing,' he said. 'I have to say I never thought I'd feel so privileged to wear the St Vincent's pyjamas. Doctors at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney used a heart-resuscitation console and preservation solution developed in Australia to transplant dead hearts into patients . Ms Gribilas (centre) said she is a 'different person altogether' after receiving her transplant . 'I'm just looking forward to getting back out into the real world.' Mr Damen said he often thinks about his donor. 'I do think about it, because without the donor I might not be here,' he said. 'I'm not religious or spiritual but it's a wild thing to get your head around.' Previously, surgeons were only able to use hearts from donor patients who were 100 per cent brain dead. These patients' hearts are kept alive and beating by life support machines and are able to be removed from the donor patient and placed straight into a Transmedics machine which keeps the heart pumping, with minimal damage to the organ. But the new solution allows transplants using hearts from 90-95 percent brain dead patients, which were previously thought to be too damaged to use. When a 90-95 percent brain-dead patient's life support is switched off, the heart gradually stops beating over a period of about 20 minutes. Under Australian law, surgeons must wait until there has been no heartbeat for five minutes before the organ can be removed. The lack of oxygen during this time causes significant damage to the heart and until now has meant those hearts could not be used for transplants. But when the new solution is injected into the heart its cells start to regenerate. One of the surgeons who performed the operations, Dr Paul Jansz, said the technology would have implications for transplant units around the world. Dr Dhital, Ms Gribilas, NSW Health Minister Jillian Skinner, Mr Damen and Prof Peter MacDonald at St Vincent's Hospital on Friday . Medical staff transporting a heart in a heart-resuscitation console developed by doctors at St Vincent's Hospital and researchers at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute . 'North America and Europe are very envious that we were able to get on and do this,' Dr Jansz told Daily Mail Australia. 'Many prestigious units around the world have been working towards this and haven't been able to pull it off. 'It literally is a world first, it means a lot for the transplant world.' Dr Jansz said the technology was approved in the last year and since then three patients have successfully received transplants. 'We did one yesterday, one about two weeks ago and the first one was about nine weeks ago,' he said. 'Hopefully we will do many more, this technology will only get better and will only be able to expand on the limitations.' Prof MacDonald, the director of the Hospital's Heart Lung Transplant Unit, said the team had been working on this project for 20 years and intensively for the past four. 'We've been researching to see how long the heart can sustain this period in which it has stopped beating,' he said. 'We then developed a technique for reactivating the heart in a so-called heart in a box machine. 'To do that we removed blood from the donor to prime the machine and then we take the heart out, connect it to the machine, warm it up and then it starts to beat.' The donor hearts were each housed in this machine for about four hours before transplantation, he said. 'Based on the performance of the heart on the machine we can then tell quite reliably whether this heart will work if we then go and transplant it. 'In many respects this breakthrough represents a major inroad to reducing the shortage of donor organs,' he said.","Doctors at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney conduct world-first transplants .

"While the country enjoys warm weather with temperatures hitting 22C and no sign of snow, councils have been criticised for putting hundreds of gritters and staff on duty. West Sussex County Council had 25 gritting lorries - almost its entire 28-strong fleet – driving around the county on practice runs this week as part of 'Operation Snowflake' and leaving sunbathers gobsmacked. In Cumbria, the council's 33 gritters have also been out on priority roads for their own dummy runs. Local authorities across Scotland have followed suit by putting 500 staff and 160 vehicles on standby, while councils like Cornwall, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire have launched their annual winter plans. Scroll down for video . Despite the fine weather, around 25 gritters, like this one in Cumbria, have been sent out by West Sussex County Council as part of a rehearsal for the winter dubbed 'Operation Snowflake' People out punting on the river Cam in Cambridge have enjoyed a beautiful sunny start to October as temperatures stay in the high teens to low 20s . A woman relaxes by the river Cam in Cambridge with her pet dog, one of thousands who are taking time out to enjoy the great autumn weather while it lasts . It has been a great day to laze about by the river across the country as the fine weather continues into October with temperatures set to stay mild for the coming days . But critics have hit out at the costs involved, with gritting schemes estimated to cost around £160million nationally each year between October and April – an average of £23million per month. While the council preparations continue, the Met Office said there is no sign of snow or ice in the 30-day outlook period ahead, with highs of 22C predicted. Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said: 'There's no strong signal in the outlook for things turning noticeably colder with snow or ice.' According to the Met Office, last month saw the warmest September since 2006, and in the last 100 years only three were warmer, two had the same mean temperature, while 95 were cooler. And Weather Services International has forecast a warmer than average October, November and December across the UK.

Nature in motion: As the warm weather continues today, a small copper butterfly feeds on asters in Stourhead, Wiltshire . John O'Connell, director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'It's hard to see what good can come from this exaggerated exercise. 'Gritting does not strike us as something that needs a huge amount of rehearsal. It's not the cheapest to keep the roads free of ice, so they shouldn't be wasting money when it's frankly unnecessary.' Surprised Twitter user John Muir, who spotted one of the gritting lorries, complained: 'Seen a gritter on the A1. Where's the frost? Councils don't waste our money, do they?' West Sussex County Council, which has stockpiled 10,500 tonnes of salt, said practice runs were to record road alterations, check for faster routes and re-familiarise drivers with roads. In time for Halloween: Lenny Seager, of Draycott, Somerset, stands among 800 pumpkins - after the dry September produced a bumper crop . Record haul: Farmer Chris Seager, of Draycott, Somerset, has around 800 pumpkins ready to harvest and they're bigger than ever. He said: 'It's my best ever crop - they're beauties.' Mr Seager, holding two prize specimens from his large crop of pumpkins, said the impressive harvest was all down to the country's warmest September since 2006 . Autumn fruit: Jenny Mowbray (left) picks apples with gardener Mark Pethullis (right) from the walled garden at Beningbrough Hall in North Yorkshire today .

Pick of the bunch: The National Trust-run property Beningbrough Hall has more than 35 varieties of apple growing in its grounds for visitors to pick and taste this weekend . Boost for gardeners: The Met Office has said this September was one of the driest since records began in 1910, with exceptionally low rainfall for many parts of the country . Pieter Montyn, the council's cabinet member for highways, said: 'There are road changes to consider every year. The rehearsal was vital preparation.' Nottinghamshire County Council has put its gritting fleet and 23 permanent night shift drivers on duty, with 46 more drivers on standby. Councillor Kevin Greaves, chairman of Nottinghamshire County Council's transport and highways committee, commented: 'Our preparations mean that we will be ready to act as soon as any bad weather arrives. 'Like most people we keep our fingers crossed and hope that the coming winter won't be too severe, but we have to be realistic and plan for the worst.' A Local Government Association spokesman said: 'There's no room for complacency - which is why councils are already out testing gritting routes and equipment, stockpiling salt and filling grit bins. 'Whatever surprises the weather may have in store this winter, residents can count on councils being as prepared as ever.'

"At 49 years of age, Bernard Hopkins is not your average professional boxer. The Philadelphia-born fighter may be just two months shy of his 50th birthday yet he holds the IBF, WBA and IBA light-heavyweight titles and is looking to add the WBO and WBC belts to that collection on Sunday morning. A unification bout with Russian Sergey Kovalev could see the oldest-ever world champion achieve yet another incredible feat - by unifying the entire division in Atlantic City. Bernard Hopkins is the oldest world champion in history at 49 and is looking to unify light-heavyweight divison . The American has re-launched himself as 'The Alien' in his last couple of world title fights . Watch the huge unification bout live on Box Nation (Sunday, 4am).

"Nottingham has overtaken Liverpool and Glasgow to become Britain’s unemployment capital. Just over 30 per cent of families in the East Midlands city are jobless – ahead of Glasgow, where 29.8 per cent of households have no-one in work. In Liverpool just over one in four homes is jobless. The highest percentage of workless households in Wales is in the Central Valleys where 23.8 per cent of households are jobless, while in Northern Ireland one in five families have no-one in work. Nottingham has been crowned Britain's jobless capital by the Office for National Statistics in its annual study into workless households . The areas with the lowest proportion of jobless homes were all in the South East, with West Sussex topping the list – with just 9 per cent of families out of work. West Sussex is followed by Surrey, Berkshire and Hertfordshire as the best areas for employment - all recording jobless rates of around 10 per cent. The Office for National Statistics said Nottingham had been hit by the decline of its textiles industry during the 1950s and 1960s. The city’s jobless rate is also skewed by a large number of students at its two universities. Once student households are stripped out Glasgow had the highest proportion of workless families - with 28.6 per cent of households without a job. Nearby Ayrshire is in second - with 28.5 per cent of families in the area out of work. Without students Nottingham sits in third place – with a jobless rate of 27.5 per cent. Glasgow and Liverpool have remained in the top five workless areas since records began in 2004. According to the Office for National Statistics Glasgow, Liverpool, Nottingham, Wolverhampton and Ayrshire have the highest proportion of jobless families . England has a lower proportion of jobless families claiming to be sick or disabled - but a higher proportion in study . According to the Office for National Statistics ‘the common link among some of the areas with the highest percentage of workless households is that they were all heavily industrialised in the last century’. ‘Glasgow was once a major force in shipbuilding as well as other engineering but competition overseas has seen that decline since the 1960s. ‘Liverpool had a large manufacturing base and one of the UK’s largest docks, which have both been in decline since the 1970s. ‘Wolverhampton also saw a decline in its iron and steel works industry during the twentieth century.’ Long-term sickness is the most common reason given for being out of work. In Northern Ireland, of the people living in workless households, 36.4 per cent said they were not working because of sickness or disability. In Scotland, 33.7 per cent gave this reason with 28.5 per cent in Wales and 26.6 per cent in England. Across the regions of England the lowest percentage not working because of sickness or disability was in London where 22.2 per cent of people in workless households gave this reason.","Just over 30% of families in the East Midlands city have no-one in work .

"Is your boyfriend acting like a total fruitcake? He’s jittery, slams his laptop shut when you walk into the room and now he’s having lunch with your sister. Don’t panic, he’s not going mad, he’s just about to propose. New research reveals there are several obvious signs you can look out for that prove your man is about to pop the question. Tell-tale sign: Has your man been cooking spaghetti bolognese for dinner and refusing to splurge on takeaways? A  new survey reveals that could be one of the most obvious signs he's about to propose . The research, which asked British women to cite the odd behaviour they noticed before their man got down on one knee, revealed the first sign as penny pinching. According to the survey, 27 per cent of women notice their future husbands being cautious with spending with one of the most tell-tale signs, they say, is their man cooking spaghetti bolognese for dinner and refusing to splurge on takeaways. Another sign to look out for is your man booking a weekend in Venice and taking care of all the details himself. According to the study, 17 per cent of women say their men whisked them away to a foreign destination so they could propose in style. Meeting the family: Another clue, say the women surveyed, is that your man starts going for lunch with your sister, best friend or family members . On top of that, nearly half of women noticed he started having lunch with their sister, or secret conversations with their parents and best friends, which, they say, is a massive hint he’s asking for your hand or researching what kind of ring you’d like. The less subtle of men can be caught out thanks to their revealing Google search history, with 67 per cent of men researching engagement rings online. He will then suddenly become interested in all things 'diamond' with 36 per cent of women saying they started to notice their partner commenting on celebrity couples’ or their friend’s engagement rings, 'subtly' gauging their reaction to ring styles and designs. The study also found that 17 per cent of men totally ruined their surprise proposal by hinting their girlfriends should go and get their nails done, found the research by The Diamond Store.

"Given it is his job to oversee the Arts, you might expect him to keep up to date with the BBC’s output.

Sounding off: Tory MP Ed Vaizey, who serves under culture secretary Sajid Javid, revealed he listens to Radio 3's independent rival Classic FM instead because it ‘plays lovely music’ and is ‘accessible and informal’ Mr Vaizey, 46, also warned yesterday that radio stations are at risk of losing younger listeners. He said he was troubled by a recent report by regulator Ofcom, which found average weekly radio listening among 15 to 24-year-olds has dropped from 18.7 hours in 2007 to 15.5 hours in 2013 – a fall of almost a fifth. Speaking at the Radio Festival in Salford, Greater Manchester, he said he believed young people still enjoy listening to radio but choose to do so over the internet instead of traditional radio sets. He insisted that it is important to make it easier to access radio on mobile phones, and said the Government and the BBC will urge smartphone manufacturers to build tuners into handsets to enable them to receive a ‘hybrid’ of digital, FM and internet radio. Mr Vaizey said the Government and the BBC will urge smartphone manufacturers to build tuners into handsets . ‘A multi-platform approach and a strong social media presence is essential for radio to increase reach and engagement with new audiences,’ he added.

It plays lovely music and is run by an amazing person. ‘What’s wrong with Radio 3? That’s a real half-empty question. The question is, what’s right with Classic FM?

But heavily redacted documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show he was put under domestic surveillance . Mr Ennals’ daughter Kate, who believes the family’s phone was tapped, said: ‘I just felt, “How dare they?” It’s such an invasion of privacy. It’s ironic in a sense. The right to privacy was one of Dad’s main things.’ His son Marc, who is mentioned in the files, added: ‘If they were doing this to him, they must have been doing this to millions of others who were essentially much more of a threat. He was just fighting for human rights.’ Last night, freedom of expression group Article 19, which Mr Ennals helped found in the 1980s, called on the Government to ‘come clean’. Executive director Thomas Hughes said: ‘The surveillance of civil society groups working on human rights, environment and other social issues without justification is illegal and a violation of the basic human rights of privacy, free expression and freedom of association.’ The files cover the period when Mr Ennals worked for Unesco and after he joined the National Council for Civil Liberties. The campaigner, who died in 1991 aged 64, later became secretary-general of Amnesty, helping it win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977. The files say a ‘comprehensive’ report on Mr Ennals was compiled as early as 1950 when he was a student activist. He joined Unesco, which was formed after the Second World War, in the early 1950s, and was based in Paris. The first reports in the released files record his arrival in Newhaven from Dieppe in July 1953 and his return three days later. In December that year, he was noted arriving at London Airport from Paris. The report said: ‘Routine search of his baggage by HM Customs revealed nothing of interest to Special Branch.’ Marc Ennals said it was ‘frustrating’ that so much material from the files had been redacted.","Campaign group calls on Government to come clean about its surveillance .

"Andy Murray is looking forward to playing Rafael Nadal for the first time since 2011 after setting up a showdown with the world number one in the quarter-finals of the Italian Open. Murray, who turned 27 on Thursday, progressed through with a 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 win over Jurgen Melzer and he was later joined in the last eight by Nadal after the reigning champion defeated Mikhail Youzhny 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-1. Eye on the ball: Andy Murray is looking forward to his quarter-final clash with Rafael Nadal at the Italian Open . Stern test: Murray survived an early rally from Jurgen Melzer before defeating the Austrian in the third round . Nadal and Murray have met 18 times down the years, with the Spaniard leading the head-to-head record 13-5, including a straight sets win in their 2011 French Open semi-final. Injuries to both players have kept them apart for their last couple of years, but Murray welcomed the chance to renew their rivalry. 'I'd love to play against him, it's be a great match for me with the French Open just around the corner because I'll see where my game's at and where I need to improve.' Murray said after his clash with Melzer and before Nadal took to the court against Youzhny. 'I haven't played him for a long time, it's been at least two and a half, three years since we played.' Don't throw in the towel yet! Murray is 13-5 down on his head-to-head record with Nadal . Pumped: Nadal came from a set down to defeat Mikhail Youzhny in the third round as he aims to defend his Italian Open title . The seventh seed added: 'This week I've wanted to try and play solid tennis as much as possible and I did a pretty good job today.' Nadal is also looking forward to facing the Wimbledon champion later on Friday. The 27-year-old, who is looking to claim the Rome title for the eighth time, said on www.atpworldtour.com: 'It's a positive match to play because you play against one of the best player of the world after two tough days. 'I don't know how he has changed his play. I know he has a complete game but I have to focus on myself.'","British No 1 meets Nadal in Italian Open quarter-final .

"You may not have heard of him yet, but sixteen-year-old Tiuri is set to be the next Harry Potter. Tiuri is the hero of a children’s story, The Letter For The King, which is published in a new, illustrated edition this week. He is already famous around the world — but it took more than five decades for his adventures to be translated into English. The front cover of The Letter For The King, which has finally been published in English, 50 years after it was first released . The book, by Tonke Dragt, was first published in Holland in 1962, translated into 15 languages and sold over a million copies worldwide. But it had never been translated into English. Now, a big-budget TV adaptation is in the pipeline and the sequel, Secrets Of The Wild Woods, is being translated. Publisher Adam Freudenheim knew he was onto a hit when he caught his son stealing pages of the book from his desk in the middle of the night. The plot sees Tiuri contemplating if he is to be knighted the next day while locked in a chapel. The book is already drawing comparisons to the highly popular Harry Potter series, which was also given a big screen adaptation . He then hears a knock at the door asking for help and he is asked to deliver a letter to King Unauwen across the Great Mountains. On his way he encounters evil and must keep his true identity a secret as well as the contents of the letter.

"This is the historic moment the last soldier out of Camp Bastion arrived home safely on British soil, marking the end of a 13-year war. Carrying a Union Jack under his arm, Wing Commander Matt Radnall of the RAF returned to the UK, in a symbolic moment . He touched down at RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, along with the final British troops returning from Afghanistan yesterday evening. Wing Commander Matt Radnall, who was the last soldier out of Camp Bastion, landed on British soil yesterday . Carrying a Union Jack under his arm, the commander from the Force Protection Wing, said it was the highlight of 24 years of serving in the RAF regiment . Just days before, more than 600 British soldiers, airmen and American marines withdrew via military aircraft to Kandahar air base in a mass exodus dubbed 'B-Day'. A ceremony was also held at the military base last week to mark the end of combat operations. Following the deaths of 453 British personnel and an overall cost  £20 billion, the base will be handed over to Afghan troops. Britain is preparing to withdraw entirely from the country by the end of this year. Wing Commander Radnall preparing to board the last Chinook helicopter to leave Camp Bastion . Following the deaths of 453 British personnel, the operation base will be handed over to Afghan troops . At the time of the withdrawal, Wing Commander Radnall, of the RAF’s 7 Force Protection Wing, said: 'The adrenalin is still flowing. That is the highlight of 24 years with the RAF Regiment without any doubt. 'It has been an extraordinary morning. It started very early and it was full-on from the word go. 'The end of each six-month tour we look forward to going home and there is a sense of finality for each individual as you finish that tour but for this one in particular, it is a real sense of occasion about it.' Brigadier Rob Thomson, the most senior British commander in Helmand, said: ‘There is pride for what has been achieved, there is a privilege of being part of something that is pretty historic and there is a confidence that the Afghans are ready to do this. ‘We are confident this is work in progress and yes there are some challenges ahead but the direction ahead is sound and we believe we have a real difference in this land. This is not a evacuation. This is a deliberately measured transfer to the Afghans.’ Bastion has been the centre of British operations in the country since UK troops were sent to Helmand in 2006 . Major General Sayed Malook, who is taking over the base, said: ‘They have given peace and security for the Afghan people.’ Apache attack helicopters continued to circle the area to deter insurgents and artillery guns were fired from different positions to confuse the enemy. Bastion has been the centre of British operations in the country since UK troops were sent to Helmand in 2006. The vast majority of the tens of thousands of British fighters who served in 'Task Force Helmand' since then, have passed through the camp.","RAF Wing Commander Matt Radnall touched down on British soil yesterday .

Abbey, 27, has been unveiled as the new face of Avon fragrance and invited her 53-year-old mother to star alongside her.

"A dog owner is considering taking legal action against the veterinary clinic that surgically removed her pug's cut eye without her permission. Kimberly Hayden took her 13-year-old pug named Chloe to the Tyrone Banfield Animal Hospital in  St Petersburg, Florida after noticing a cloudiness in the dog's left eye. A veterinarian diagnosed the issue as an abrasion to the eye and recommended Hayden get the eye removed for $1,400; treat it with a skin graft for $3,000 or drops. Hayden chose the least-painful route for Chloe and the two were sent home with three different eye drops and two oral medications. Scroll down for video . Poor pug: Kimberly Hayden dropped her 13-year-old pug named Chloe off at the veterinary clinic recently, and when she picked her up hours later found that doctors had removed her dog's eye . Before: Above, a picture of Chloe before the operation that would leave her with one eye . However, the vet asked Hayden to bring her dog in for a follow up visit and it was later that afternoon that she first heart of the procedure that had been accidentally carried out on her beloved dog. 'Around noon, I get a phone call and the girl on the phone says, ""I just want you to know, Chloe is doing well. She's recovering well from surgery.""' Hayden told Fox 13. 'I started shaking. I think I stopped breathing for a minute,' she recalled.  'I was like, ""Excuse me? What are you talking about? She's supposed to be there for a follow up.""' When Hayden dropped her dog off at the veterinarian's office that day, she even filled out paper work writing that it was simply a follow-up appointment and that she must be called for all procedures over $5 dollars. While she was warned on the phone about her dog's condition, it was not enough to prepare Hayden for what she saw when she later picked up Chloe. 'As soon as he brought her in the room, I completely broke down. She immediately recognized my voice and came right to me. Jumped up, wanted to be in my lap and curled up into a ball,' Hayden said. Chloe continues to struggle getting used to life with just one eye, her owner says, adding that she is considering suing the clinic. Reportedly, the clinic at first left Hayden with the bill for the treatment but are now going to pay for the procedure. Hayden filled out paperwork before dropping off her dog, marking that it was only a follow-up visit . She also wrote that she should be contacted for any procedures over $5 . They have since issued a statement on their error. 'At Banfield Pet Hospital, we are committed to partnering with clients in all decisions regarding their pet's care. In the instance of Chloe, although the care provided was medically necessary based on the severity of her condition and lack of response to therapy, we did fail to get surgical authorization from the client on the day of the procedure,' Banfield client advocate Ari Zabell said. 'However, we had previously discussed the need for surgery with the client — we also communicated that surgery was critical to alleviate Chloe's pain and potential for infection. We apologize for the lack of clear communication and will continue to attempt to reach Ms. Hayden in an effort to further resolve her concerns. In the meantime, we wish Chloe a speedy recovery.' One-eyed: Hayden says Chloe is still getting used to life with one eye, and sometimes bumps into objects around her .","Kimberly Hayden took her  13-year-old pug Chloe to a Banfield Animal hospital for a follow-up appointment about an abrasion on the dog's eye .

"A fascinating letter by astronaut Neil Armstrong prior to his historic moon landing in which he contemplated the words he would speak if the mission was successful has been unearthed. The letter was sent to a fan a month before Armstrong became the first person ever to walk on the surface of the moon on July 21, 1969. Millions watched live on television as he took his first steps and famously declared the mission was 'one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind'. The amazing letter was written by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin just weeks before the moon mission . The letter was signed by astronauts Neil Armstrong, left and Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin, right . Neil Armstrong, pictured inside the Apollo 11 module was the first man to walk on the moon on July 20, 1969 . The words are among the most celebrated of all time and helped secure Armstrong's place in the history books. Fittingly, in his letter to Hawaiian supporter Mrs A. O. Teller on June 23, 1969, Armstrong revealed he hadn't decided on what he would say should the Apollo 11 moon landing go to plan but hoped she would be 'pleased with whatever message we do have'. Armstrong said: 'Colonel Aldrin and I appreciate your taking the time to write us for your suggestion on a message from the lunar surface. 'We do not know at this time what our inclination will be should we be successful in our landing attempt. 'I certainly hope you will be pleased with whatever message we do have and the impressions that people on earth receive from our efforts.' The letter, on NASA-headed notepaper and signed by both Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, has sold for almost $24,000 at a sale held by RR Auction in Boston, Massachusetts. The signed letter does not feature the third man on the Apollo 11 mission Michael Collins, centre . Neil Armstrong can be seen in the reflection of Buzz Aldrin's mask, taking this iconic photograph . A spokesman from RR Auction said: 'This amazing letter pertains to one of the most historically significant broadcasts of all time-the first words sent to Earth from another world. 'Even before Armstrong, Aldrin, and Michael Collins would lift off for the moon on Apollo 11, people wondered what those words might be. 'With the danger and uncertainty that swirled around the historic NASA mission, its success was more important to Armstrong and the crew than what words would be uttered. 'As Armstrong noted here, ""We do not know at this time what our inclination will be should we be successful in our landing attempt. I certainly hope you will be pleased with whatever message we do have."" 'He later explained that following a train of thought that he had had after launch and during six hours and 40 minute after landing, he developed the now famous line, ""That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind."" 'This is the only correspondence we have seen between Armstrong and Aldrin and someone outside of NASA regarding one of the most historic and familiar quotes of modern times.' Astronaut Michael Collins remained on board the Columbia mother ship while the others went to the moon .

"Niki Lauda's panegyric on Lewis Hamilton in the minutes after the Spanish Grand Prix was a classic of its kind. 'Lewis Hamilton is unbeatable,' said the Mercedes chairman, dogmatically. 'It's very simple. He's getting better and better every race. He makes no bloody mistake whatsoever. He knows what he's doing. He's got a strong personality. He's focused. 'Nico tried every trick today to get him. And he did a good job, but he couldn't pass him.' Getting the job done: Lewis Hamilton leads the drivers' championship after winning the last four grands prix . Gap: Hamilton holds off Nico Rosberg in Spain . Even if you cavil about Lewis being 'unbeatable', the thrust of Lauda's argument cannot be denied. His comments could be taken as Rosberg being told by his boss that he is unfavoured by the team. I am not so sure. If Rosberg were to beat Lewis repeatedly, Lauda would be just as glowing in his appreciation of the German. That is the Lauda way. Everything is full-throttle. We should also remember that there is an instinctive desire among some high-ups at Mercedes to produce a Teutonic champion. That is why they sought to jettison Jenson Button when they bought the team from Ross Brawn at the end of the 2009 season. His departure made way for them to bring Michael Schumacher out of retirement to partner Rosberg. Rosberg's problem is not that he is being treated as a second-class citizen but that, by small margins in the most demanding of circumstances, he is driving like one. Taking time out: Nico Rosberg is pictured with fiancee Vivian during a break in Portofino, Italy this week . The launch this week of Formula E, the electronic series that will race in 10 cities around the world from September, has shown it has one advantage over Formula One: it can be unashamed about its 'green' agenda. Organisers admit it will barely make more noise than rustling paper. Formula One, meanwhile, tried to raise the volume by (unsuccessfully) testing a megaphone in Barcelona this week. Some, including Bernie Ecclestone, say the lack of noise is a turn-off; others, led by Ecclestone's old mucker and former FIA president Max Mosley, say the muted engines are positive because they are ear and family friendly. Formula E accepts that the fastest their cars will go is 135mph. They also acknowledge that their batteries – a technology that is developing slowly – will not last the race distance. So drivers will get out of one car and into another after 35 minutes. On the other hand, Formula One frets that some of its cars are slower than some GP cars despite going above 200mph. This reveals several things. Formula E, being new, can escape without a public outcry for shortcomings that would see Formula One, the world's premier series, not only scrutinised minutely but lampooned. It also shows that Formula E knows its own mind. It is not burdened by its past. It can merrily fill a niche without worrying about its broader role in the motor-racing firmament. That freedom is something that Formula One – confused and torn – can only envy. Limit: Formula E accepts that the fastest their cars will go is 135mph . My two most mesmerising annual experiences at trackside were, first, standing in the tunnel at Monaco as the cars roared through and, secondly, watching them dance through the swimming pool complex just down the road. The first shook your entire body from toes to brain. It was so loud that one Guardian journalist partly lost his hearing. The noise level will obviously not be the same this year given the new, quieter engines. But what about the second experience? Will the cars look so brutish yet still light on their feet? Will they still brake and accelerate at a speed you cannot find anywhere else in motor racing?  I shall report from the pit lane on my findings. Picture that: The iconic surroundings for Monte Carlo will play host to next week's Monaco Grand Prix . Eric Boullier, McLaren's de facto team principal, hosted a private dinner for a few of us hacks in Barcelona last weekend. What precisely was said remains off the record. However, I can report perhaps the most important factor in his attempt to restore the team's fortunes: he has a sharp and perceptive mind. He has detected what was wrong and how to put it right. We wish him well. It is a big job. Vision: Eric Boullier joined McLaren from Lotus as the British team constructor look to revive their fortunes . My colleague Simon Heffer is not a visitor to the paddock. That may explain why on page 187 of his excellent book Simply English, An A to Z of Avoidable Errors there is no entry between 'Islamic and Islamist' and 'It is obvious that'. The word I would have included is 'Issue'. It is misused by Formula One drivers and teams as a synonym (or is it a euphemism?) for 'problem', as in: 'We had a fuel/tyre/overheating issue today.' I imagine Simon would share my distaste for another phrase prevalent in Formula One: 'for sure', the filler used by drivers during their press conferences in such sentences as: 'For sure, we will try our best.' Fernando Alonso, I seem to recall, was a pioneer of this usage. I propose that the FIA introduce the equivalent of a swear box to deal with these linguistic failings. Guilty party: Ferrari's Fernando Alonso is prone to using the phrase, 'for sure', during a race weekend . One Show presenter Chris Evans, a motor-racing enthusiast, was in Monaco this week to buy the original 1974 Hesketh, one of only three cars in the 308 and 308B series. James Hunt's son Freddie, who has returned from living in Argentina to restart his track career in endruance racing, said he was 'very glad' Evans had added his father's old car to his extensive collection. He paid £230,000 for the privilege.

"Catholic bishops meeting to discuss 'family issues' at a two week summit have scrapped plans to welcome gay members of the Church. Showing deep divisions at the end of the Vatican synod, which was sought by Pope Francis in part to chart a more merciful approach to homosexuals, the bishops failed to approve even a watered-down section on ministering to gay Catholics. Midway through the summit, a draft document was released proposing remarkably progressive plans for the Catholic Church, saying unmarried couples living together can be 'positive', and gay relationships and divorcees must be welcomed. But by the time the synod ended, the welcoming tone of acceptance had been stripped away and replaced by a paragraph describing homosexuality as a 'problem' Catholic families have to confront. Progressive: Showing deep divisions at the end of the Vatican synod, sought by Pope Francis in part to chart a more merciful approach to homosexuals, bishops failed to approve even watered-down proposals . Rather than considering gays as individuals who had gifts to offer the church, the revised paragraph referred to homosexuality as one of the problems Catholic families have to confront. It said 'people with homosexual tendencies must be welcomed with respect and delicacy,' but repeated church teaching that marriage is only between man and woman. The paragraph failed to reach the two-thirds majority needed to pass. Two other paragraphs concerning the other hot-button issue at the synod of bishops — whether divorced and civilly remarried Catholics can receive Communion — also failed to pass. The outcome showed a deeply divided church on some of the most pressing issues facing Catholic families. It appeared that the 118-62 vote on the gay section might have been a protest vote by progressive bishops who refused to back the watered-down wording. The original draft had said gays had gifts to offer the church and that their partnerships, while morally problematic, provided gay couples with 'precious' support. New era: Pope Francis is pictured at the synod last week. Displaying remarkably liberal attitudes for a Church famed for its conservatism, a draft document that emerged midway through the synod said gay members must be welcomes and unmarried couples living together can be 'positive' New Ways Ministry, a Catholic gay rights group, said it was 'very disappointing' that the final report had backtracked from the welcoming words contained in the draft. Nevertheless, it said the synod's process 'and openness to discussion provides hope for further development down the road, particularly at next year's synod, where the makeup of the participants will be larger and more diverse, including many more pastorally-oriented bishops.' The draft had been written by a Francis appointee, Monsignor Bruno Forte, a theologian known for pushing the pastoral envelope on ministering to people in 'irregular' unions. The draft was supposed to have been a synopsis of the bishops' interventions, but many conservatives complained that it reflected a minority and overly progressive view. Francis insisted in the name of transparency that the full document — including the paragraphs that failed to pass — be published along with the voting tally. The document will serve as the basis for future debate leading up to another meeting of bishops next October that will produce a final report to be sent to Francis. 'Personally I would have been very worried and saddened if there hadn't been these ... animated discussions ... or if everyone had been in agreement or silent in a false and acquiescent peace,' Francis told the synod hall after the vote. Prayer: Rather than considering gays as individuals who had gifts to offer the church, the final plans referred to homosexuality as one of the problems Catholic families have to confront . Conservatives had harshly criticized the draft and proposed extensive revisions to restate church doctrine, which holds that gay sex is 'intrinsically disordered,' but that gays themselves are to be respected, and that marriage is only between a man and woman. 'We could see that there were different viewpoints,' said Cardinal Oswald Gracis of India, when asked about the most contentious sections of the report on homosexuals and divorced and remarried Catholics. German Cardinal Walter Kasper, the leader of the progressive camp, said he was 'realistic' about the outcome. In an unexpected gesture after the voting, Francis approached a group of journalists waiting outside the synod hall to thank them for their work covering the synod. 'Thanks to you and your colleagues for the work you have done,' he said. 'Grazie tante.' Conservative bishops had harshly criticized journalists for reporting on the dramatic shift in tone in the draft, even though the media reports merely reflected the document's content. Meeting: Two other paragraphs concerning the other hot-button issue at the synod of bishops — whether divorced and civilly remarried Catholics can receive Communion — also failed to pass at the synod . Francis' gesture, and his words inside the synod hall chastising bishops who were overly wed to doctrine and were guided by 'hostile rigidity,' as well as those bishops who showed a 'destructive goody-goodiness,' indicated that he was well aware of the divisions the debate had sparked. His speech received a four-minute standing ovation, participants said. Over the past week, the bishops split themselves up into working groups to draft amendments to the text. They were nearly unanimous in insisting that church doctrine on family life be more fully asserted and that faithful Catholic families should be held up as models and encouraged rather than focus on family problems and 'irregular' unions. The bishops signaled a similar tone in a separate message directed at Christian families released Saturday. There was no mention whatsoever of families with gay children, much less gay parents, and it spoke of the 'complex and problematic' issues that arise when marriages fail and new relationships begin. 'Christ wanted his church to be a house with the door always open to welcome everyone, without excluding anyone,' the message read. (Oddly, the English translation was less welcoming than the official Italian, ending the sentence after 'everyone.') Welcome: Vatican Swiss Guards  salute Pope Francis as he arrives for the synod last week . Cardinal Wilfrid Fox Napier of South Africa, who helped draft the revised final report, told Vatican Radio the final document showed a 'common vision' that was lacking in the draft. He said the key areas for concern were 'presenting homosexual unions as if they were a very positive thing' and the suggestion that divorced and remarried Catholics should be able to receive Communion without an annulment. He complained that the draft was presented as the opinion of the whole synod, when it was 'one or two people.' 'And that made people very angry,' he said.","Bishops failed to approve plans to welcome gay members of the Church .

"Ford is recalling about 850,000 cars and SUVs because of a problem that could stop the air bags from working in a crash. The recalled models include the 2013-14 Ford C-Max compact, Fusion midsize, Escape SUV and the Lincoln MKZ luxury car, all sold in North America. Ford says the restraints control module in the car could short circuit, causing the air-bag warning indicator to light up. Vehicle: The 2013-2014 Lincoln MKZ luxury car (left) and the 2013-2014 Ford C-Max (right) are being recalled because of a problem that could stop the air bags from working in a crash . If the short circuit occurs, restraint devices including the air bags, pretensioners, and side curtains might not work in a crash, the car company says. Ford says the short circuit could also affect the car's stability control and other systems. Ford Motor Co. says it 'is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this condition. Dealers will replace the restraints control module at no cost to the customer.' The company said 746,842 of the vehicles were sold in the U.S., with 82,962 sold in Canada and 20,246 sold in Mexico. Danger: Ford Motors says if a short circuit occurrs, restraint devices might not work in a crash for the 2013-2014 Ford Fusion (left) and the 2013-2014 Ford Escape (right) Ford says 'Affected vehicles include certain 2013-2014 C-MAX vehicles built at Michigan Assembly Plant, Jan. 19, 2012 to Nov. 21, 2013; certain 2013-2014 Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Feb. 3, 2012 to Aug. 24, 2013; certain 2013-2014 Escape vehicles built at Louisville Assembly Plant, Oct. 5, 2011 to Nov. 1, 2013 and certain 2013-2014 Lincoln MKZ vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, April 25, 2012 to Sept. 30, 2013.' Ford shares rose 7 cents to $16.27 in morning trading. Automakers have recalled more than 40 million cars and trucks in the U.S. so far this year, which is a record. Most of those vehicles have been recalled by General Motors Co., which announced early this year that a faulty ignition switch could cut power to the engine, knocking out the power steering or brakes and disabling the air bags if the car crashes.","Ford is recalling about 850,000 cars and SUVs in North America .

"Fitness guru Kortney Olson does it all. The certified personal trainer from the Gold Coast is also an Olympic weightlifting coach, three time international body builder competitor, cross fit yoga junkie and Australia's first female arm wrestling champion. One of Kortney's most passionate projects has been helping young women to build confidence and accept their body image. But a recent decision to have a breast enlargement has sparked questions as to whether the trainer herself has acceptance of her own body image? Scroll down for video . Kortney (pictured) after her breast augmentation who said 'it was one of the best decision I've ever made' Kortney runs a program called Kamp Konfidence which helps to empower young women to have body confidence and be positive about their body image . It would suggest that she does, after posting a story of her breast augmentation from an A cup to a D cup, on her online blog to tell fans what was going on and how the surgery has not changed her one bit. Referring to herself as Boob Job Betty, Kortney praised her surgeon, Dr. Ces Rhymes with the work he has done in putting in her 500cc implants. 'I can't begin to tell you how much more sexier I feel. How feminine..... having muscles, a half shaved head and small pecks have been great but there is definitely a side of me that has felt my femininity slipping down the drain,' she said. The trainer, who got the breast enlargement last month has seemingly been very transparent with her decision to get the surgery and has added a little humour to the situation. 'Girls make sure you marry a man who picks you up from a breast augmentation that he financed/paid for and a bouquet of gorgeous flowers.' The blog went on to say, 'I fully intended for paying for my own job but my husband's main purpose in life is to find ways to create joys and happiness for me.' Kortney (pictured) says her breast implants make her feel more 'feminine' and 'sexier' Kortney has defended her decision to get breast implants saying women should be able to make their own choices . Her decision to get breast enlargements got plenty of support from her fans . One supporter on facebook said 'I love you and I love your work' One facebook fan supported Kortney's decision and felt it was one she did for herself . 'I had a short window of time where I could have the job done, so he insisted on paying and moving forward.' 'Anyway, let me please tell you that this was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life.' Kortney has hit back at anyone that wants to make assumptions about her decision to have her breasts enlarged, which included an article by the Gold Coast Bulletin. She returned fire by saying on social media, 'At least they've stopped calling me an 'ex controversial porn star' in the headlines!' 'Who gives a s**t what people say about you, the only opinion that matter of yourself, is your own,' she said. The post received a lot of attention from her fans, who made numerous comments supporting her decision. 'Keep doing what you do Kort. You're an inspiration with boobs and without. Positive impact is all that matters,' one user wrote. Another said, 'I love you and I love your work,' while one commented, 'it's not for men, it's for herself.' Kortney Olson came under the media spotlight in 2012. The trainer from the Gold Coast is a certified personal trainer, Olympic weightlifting coach, three time international body builder competitor, cross fit yoga junkie and Australia's first female arm wrestling champion . Kortney (pictured) before her breast enlargement says it's she needed to balance out her body which is so muscular by getting breast implants . The trainer, who admitted to a past life of drug abuse, being a former fetish porn star and rape, joined the Gold Coast Titans, with husband, David May, as the CEO, as a volunteer to help with strength and conditioning. She defended her right to be there when a parent of a junior player called for her and her husband to be sacked. Kortney launched Kamp Konfidence with her husband a year ago, a Not For Profit company aimed at empowering females by teaching the tools, habits, and principles that aid in developing self love. She told the Gold Coast Bulletin she wanted to balance her top half to match her muscular lower body for competitions. 'I had started to look in the mirror and thought wow, I look like a 15-year-old boy,' she said. Despite the stigma attached to cosmetic surgery, she believes women should be able to make their own choices. 'People change ... as long as you know who you are inside, that's all that matters,' she told the Gold Coast Bulletin.","Fitness trainer Kortney Olson gets a breast augmentation .

"This drummers looks to be on the path to stardom after an impressive performance - aged just two years old. Picking up the sticks for a show alongside a church choir, toddler Camden Harper McSwain looks every inch a star in the making, keeping in with the tempo and partnering the vocals to perfection. Wearing a flat cap and a cheeky smile, Camden struts his way through the performance in this catchy and heartwarming video. The two-year-old shows a rhythm and timing in abundance in an impressive choir performance . He is the centre of attention to more than just one person though, as the man who appears to be directing proceedings from the stage, gets his camera phone out to snap the little guy in action. His starting position of being seated doesn't last long, and he gets to his feet as the music stirs excitement in the church hall. The start of the performance appears nervy, with the child looking out to someone in the audience for guidance, but once the action starts, there really is no holding him back. The man who is also filming the action starts seated, but is soon on his feet showing appreciation . His timing is flawless, and along with a drumming partner behind him, the performance will see you tapping your feet in appreciation. The action was filmed at Greater Mt. Zion Church in Mississippi, which by the looks of it, could be a real hotbed of musical talent. The young drummer's mother Pamela McSwain told Mail Online: 'Camden absolutely loves playing the drums. I bought him his first set before his first birthday because he had began beating on pots and pans under the cabinet with various silverware that he could crawl and find. 'Camden quickly taught himself to play the drums by ear. He is yet to receive professional drum lessons. 'This was his first time performing for a group. Camden loves every type of music. His dynamic personality often draws attention from others when we're out in public.'","Camden Harper McSwain shows off his skills in church choir performance .

"One of Australia's highest profile bikie gang members has been confirmed dead by police, prompting an outpouring of grief from the Bandidos community. Arthur Loveday's body was found in a motel room in Kew, near Port Macquarie, on Saturday, from an apparent suicide. Mr Loveday, 61, had been staying at the motel for several days, and police have indicated that the circumstances surrounding his death are not suspicious, reported The Daily Telegraph. Arthur Loveday's body was found in a motel room in Kew, near Port Macquarie, on Saturday, from an apparent suicide . Mr Loveday, 61, had been staying at the motel for several days, and police have indicated that the circumstances surrounding his death are not suspicious . The Bandidos member shot to notoriety when he was convicted for murdering Stephen Leslie Shipley in Parramatta Jail in 1992 and was sentenced to life in jail. He launched an appeal, represented by a former nun as legal council, the late Mother Yvonne Swift, and was granted a pardon. The bikie had been recruited by the Bandidos after a stint in Berrima Jail, and was often compared to 'Mr T' by the media for his tendency to wear an excess of gold jewellery. He had previously served time in jail for a litany of charges including rape, armed robbery, and kidnapping and had escaped from jail twice while serving sentences. In his last conviction before he died, Mr Loveday was sentenced to nine months jail three years ago for flushing steroids down a toilet following a police raid on his home. He moved to Port Macquarie in the late 1990's and began investing in the community, becoming involved with junior rugby league coaching and the surf life saving club, reported Port News. After the death of murdered Bandidos chapter president Rodney “Hooks” Monk, Mr Loveday said that he had put violence behind him. 'We’ve got enough worry about fighting terrorists let alone fighting one another,' he said.

"A boy has been found guilty of raping a teenager  in punishment for 'spreading rumours' about his sister, who told the victim 'snitches get stitches'. Lacquan Weekes, 17, carried out the attack in an alleyway after being egged on by his sister Aliyah Weekes, 19, and a 16-year-old girl. He was found guilty of rape, while his sister and the 16-year-old, who stood trial alongside him at the Old Bailey, were found guilty of aiding and abetting the attack. Lacquan Weekes (left) raped the 15-year-old after his sister Aliyah Weekes (right) threatened her with violence . The 15-year-old victim, who cannot be identified, was made to perform a sex act on Lacquan Weekes, who is 10 days away from his 18th birthday. She had left home on an evening in April to buy a drink and was confronted by the two teenage girls in a park in Willesden, north-west London. Aliyah Weekes had told her 'snitches get stitches' when she accused the victim of telling secrets about her and the 16-year-old. Prosecutor James Dawes had previously told the court: 'It was Aliyah's idea. She was the one who said, 'Snitches get stitches'. 'She was the one who physically threatened (the victim) and said it was her who would punch her if she did not comply.' Nine days earlier, Aliyah Weekes, the 16-year-old girl charged alongside her and the victim had been involved in an attack on a different girl in a park. The 15-year-old who was later raped had told police what had happened in that incident. There were tears and wailing from the defendants in the dock as the jury came back after eight hours of deliberations to find the brother and sister and their friend guilty. After the jury returned its verdicts, Judge Jeremy Donne, sitting at the Old Bailey, said: 'It seems to me there was degradation and humiliation which went beyond the commission of the acts.' He described it as a 'sustained incident' involving prolonged violence. He said: 'There is no doubt that the defendants acted together to commit the offence.' The confrontation is said to have happen on a patch of grass outside the College of North West London campus in Willesden, north-west London (pictured) before the girl was led to an alley . The 19-year-old and the 16-year-old then forced her into an alleyway where she was forced to perform a sex act on the boy while they stood nearby, the court heard. Afterwards, he grabbed her and tried to pull her back, but she managed to get away saying she wanted to go home, the court heard. The victim's mother had become concerned when she did not come home by 10.30pm and had called police. All the defendants had denied the charges. Aliyah and Lacquan Weekes were remanded in custody and the other defendant was bailed until their sentencing on on Friday, 17 October. Investigating officer Detective Constable, Daniel Pegg, said outside court: 'This was a disgraceful attack during which the victim was surrounded, accused of betraying confidence, assaulted and then threatened with further violence if she did not comply with their demands. 'I would like to pay tribute to the victim for her bravery in giving evidence. I hope the sentences handed out will reflect the serious nature of this incident and dissuade others from committing such offences.'","Victim was accused of spreading rumours about 19-year-old Aliyah Weekes .

"The prospect of a $34 million fiber-optic line that would dramatically improve mobile connectivity in Yellowstone National Park has ignited furious debate over whether any place should be off-limits to technology. Park officials are in preliminary discussions with CenturyLink about plans to install a wireless service that would allow streaming deep within the historical national park. But critics  have argued that the  line, reaching from the neighboring Grand Teton National Park, could compromise Yellowstone's natural wilderness. Vince Swagerty in Yellowstone National Park. The amateur photographer said he was not surprised when he ran into trouble uploading pictures during a July tour of the park with his family . Details on the Yellowstone fiber optic project were obtained by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility through a public records request and confirmed by The Associated Press. The Washington, D.C. advocacy group's executive director, Jeff Ruch, warned that bumping up the park's bandwidth will create more electronic distractions at the expense of the park's natural wonders. Sprawled across nearly 3,500 square miles spanning Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, Yellowstone is a mountain wilderness featuring lakes, canyons and rivers. It is home to grizzly bears, wolves, and herds of bison and elk and is famed for its hundreds of geysers - hot springs that erupt periodically - including Old Faithful. The CenturyLink proposal comes as concession companies have been pushing for more digital access in national parks, including Arizona's Grand Canyon, Texas' Big Bend and Maine's Acadia. It also coincides with a National Park Service campaign to 'Go Digital' ahead of its 100th anniversary in 2016. It is a notion far removed from the park system's early days, when President Theodore Roosevelt took a break from a national speaking tour and dropped from the public eye for two weeks to go camping in Yellowstone. Yet as wireless connectivity spreads into almost every corner of modern life, the social pressures to 'whittle away' at the remaining technology-free refuges are immense, said James Katz, a professor and director of emerging media studies at Boston University. Yellowstone Falls in the national park. Park officials are in preliminary discussions with CenturyLink about plans to install a wireless service that would allow streaming deep within Yellowstone . Sprawled across nearly 3,500 square miles spanning Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, Yellowstone is a mountain wilderness featuring lakes, canyons and rivers . Professor Katz had a first-hand experience of these pressures this summer, when he traveled through Yellowstone with his teenage children. Whenever connectivity dropped off, the complaints from the teenagers would begin. 'It was quite fascinating to see a naturally-occurring experiment about what happens when you take away technology from kids,' Professor Katz said. 'They wanted to be in touch with their friends and exchange Snapchat photos - not of the beautiful scenery but themselves.' Another visitor, Vince Swagerty of Newberg, Oregon, was not surprised when he ran into trouble uploading pictures during a July tour of Yellowstone with his wife, son, 20, and daughter, 23. Yellowstone National Park is famed for its hundreds of geysers, which are hot springs that erupt periodically . 'You take a cell phone shot of one of the bison right next to you, almost looking in your window, and you want to get that up on Facebook,' said Mr Swagerty, a 51-year-old tech-savvy amateur photographer. 'You pretty much know you're not going to upload any normal-sized pictures from a cell phone, be we expected to face that.' He added that it would be 'neat' if Yellowstone had the same technological conveniences he finds outside the park, but said he would not be bothered if he went back and still had connection problems ten years from now. No survey has been done to determine the quality and extent of wireless coverage in the 401 parks and other attractions overseen by the National Park Service, agency spokeswoman Alexandra Picavet said. Critics have warned that bumping up the park's bandwidth will create more electronic distractions at the expense of the park's natural wonders . She explained that the 'Go Digital' campaign will not shape up the same way in every park, and each will have to decide what is suitable. But she said that the park service has no intention of looking backward as it enters a second century. 'People are dependent on wireless, they're dependent on cellular - a mode of communication and activeness that is different from what the National Park Service has provided previously,' Ms Picavet said. Louisiana-based CenturyLink has not submitted a formal application on the Yellowstone proposal, according to park officials and company spokeswoman Michelle Jackson. Yellowstone National Park is home to grizzly bears, as well as wolves, and herds of bison and elk . For the project to make economic sense in such a remote area, Ms Jackson said, the company has asked for most costs to be covered by the Park Service and companies that would benefit from the line, including Verizon, Union Wireless and park concessionaires. Park officials said they have not agreed to provide any money. Yellowstone technology chief Bret De Young said the proposal offers a chance improve spotty and limited wireless services. He stressed that coverage still would be restricted to five developed areas inside the park. Opponenets of the fiber-optic line fear that the technology could compromise Yellowstone's natural wilderness . 'They would want you to think we're going to do wall-to-wall coverage so people can watch Netflix,' Mr De Young said, referring to the proposal's critics. 'It's just about taking the infrastructure we have and making it work.' Mr Ruch, the advocacy group director, said it would be inappropriate for the park to put any money toward a fiber-optic line given its backlog of road maintenance and other basic infrastructure improvements. He said the park should halt discussions with CenturyLink or invite public input into whether it is a good idea. But Mr Ruch also acknowledged that his group is up against a suffusion of technology that shows no signs of abating. 'I think if we were to put it to a vote, we're a Luddite minority,' he said.","Officials are in discussions with CenturyLink over plans for wireless service .

"It is all about the wait. Not for Hull City with no major prizes to show for 110 years of trying but for Arsenal or, more specifically according to Arsene Wenger, for their supporters. ‘Trophies matter for your fans,’ said Wenger. ‘It is a concrete sign that you win and that’s what we want to do. I love to win. Fans love to win. Your fans will be happy when you win trophies.’ The Arsenal manager gives the impression he has become weary of the wait. He is not impatient, but he finds the simplification tedious and gets annoyed that it can detract from his overall work in modernising a north London institution. Losing the wait: Wenger is ready to end Arsenal's nine-year trophy drought against Hull on Saturday . Times gone by: Arsenal haven't had this sort of celebration for almost a decade . The last time: Patrick Vieira lifts the FA Cup in 2005, the last trophy the Gunners won . It also, of course, provides a convenient stick to beat him with; a stick  Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho finds hard to let go. ‘You win the next game or you lose it,’ said Wenger. ‘If you win it, what do you think? You think you dance for one week? You think about preparing well for the next season and to win the first game of next season. That’s what it is to be. ‘I will not be dancing on the beach in Rio, believe me. ‘It is the next game. I want to win the next game. It is an FA Cup final. I want to win the FA Cup final.’ He is tired of questions about the wait. ‘It has become a way to think for everybody,’ said Wenger. ‘If you look at the overall consistency, nobody has finished in the Champions League in England for 18 years. Nobody. 'It is true we are used to winning every year, basically. And, suddenly you don’t win and it becomes a way of thinking. ‘You could go to some other clubs and . ask: “Why did you not win the championship for 20 years?” Nobody asks . them the question. It’s a non-creative way for everybody to organise . press conferences. Flat track bully? Mesut Ozil needs to show his quality on the big stage for Arsenal fans to end the season happy . A new hope: Aaron Ramsey has been brilliant when fit this season, and can help lead Arsenal to glory . ‘Three weeks ago, you asked me: “What would you like? To be in the Champions League or win the FA Cup?” I told you both. We have done the first and now we can do the second one.’ Wenger is still portrayed as a footballing romantic, committed to flair and crusading against the unfairness of ‘financial doping’. He also has a cold economic mind and a strategic definition of success. If it actually were a straight choice there is no way he, or owner Stan Kroenke for that matter, would trade the £30million annual windfall of the Champions League for the cheap hit of an FA Cup win. Yet the shiny new trophy which will be awarded to the triumphant captain at Wembley today has come to represent more than another FA Cup win (It would be Arsenal’s 11th and Wenger’s fifth). It can also end the club’s longest wait for a trophy since the 18-year drought which preceded the 1971 Double. It can offer a tangible sign of progress. It can buy Wenger time, restore support and lift the mood as he signs the new contract. The contract: a wait within a wait. The manager insists the delay is nothing to do with ending the wait, but still keeps the club waiting. If Hull win the FA Cup on Saturday — the club’s first trophy of note since the Division Three title in 1966 — there is likely to be at best a mixed reaction at the Emirates to the prospect of another two years of Wenger. Patience is thin. Arsenal have lost a Champions League final, a Carling Cup final in calamitous fashion, and title challenges have flickered with promise and faded during the last nine years. An image has been formed, often encouraged by Wenger, of an immature team lacking the courage and confidence to convert their talent into something more ‘concrete’. The Arsenal boss bristles at talk of a mental block; especially on the eve of another showpiece they are expected to win. Wenger’s team have been brutally effective against most mid-and-lower table Premier League teams this season. The extra quality of Mesut Ozil, the development of Aaron Ramsey and a more solid defence, have certainly taken the team on from last season. They still have to prove they have what it takes to win something. In the FA Cup semi-final against Wigan Arsenal were eight minutes from another Wembley embarrassment before Per Mertesacker saved the tie, took the game into extra-time and they won on penalties. ‘We were on a low point,’ said Wenger. ‘There was more at stake than just going to the final. We were under threat in the Premier League, as well. To have lost against Wigan would have had consequences on our chances to finish in the top four. It would have created a huge disappointment. But we made it through. Tough: When Arsenal fell behind to Wigan it looked like their season was falling apart. Survival: Lukas Fabianski's saves in the FA Cup semi-final were enough to see the Gunners return to Wembley . 'We are favourites. Unfortunately that doesn’t guarantee you anything.’ Mertesacker promised Arsenal will not ‘collapse’ and that the team were ready to take this step; to end the wait and release the pressure which has built up over time and go on to greater things. Wenger’s FA Cup win in 2005 was not easy on the eye. It was win-at-all-costs against a rampant  Manchester United. The same could be said about today’s game. Can he end the wait?","Arsenal manager Wenger dislikes the simple nature of his trophy critics, but he too has grown weary of the wait .

"A man on trial for allegedly shooting dead a teenager in cold blood in an argument over loud music has taken the witness stand, saying he feared for his life when he opened fire. Prosecutors say Michael Dunn killed 17-year-old Jordan Davis of Marietta, Georgia, in November 2012 when he fired 10 times into an SUV carrying four teenagers. After he took the stand closing arguments began at the Duval County Courthouse. Michael Dunn wipes a tear as he testifies during his retrial at the Duval County Courthouse today . Jordan Davis, 17, of Marietta, Georgia,  who was shot dead in November 2012 . Dunn was convicted of three counts of attempted second-degree murder in February and already faces at least 60 years in prison. The jury in the first trial deadlocked on the first-degree murder count. After the arguments, the jury will begin deliberating the case. Earlier this week Dunn's fiancee told how they went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes straight after the killing. Rhonda Rouer, who was inside the store when the shooting happened, said she heard shots and was immediately told to get in the car by Dunn, who drove them back to their hotel. The couple then ordered a meal, made drinks and went to bed. Dunn was arrested the following morning. The shooting - which nobody denies led to Davis's death - happened after a shouting match between Dunn and the group of teenagers in the car. Dunn is accused of firing 10 times into the SUV, including several times as the driver tried to get away. One of the shots killed Davis. No one else in the SUV was injured. Earlier in the trial, prosecutor John Guy said Dunn fired at the SUV 'with malice in his heart and intent in his hand' while the defense said it happened because he felt in imminent danger. Using a dowel, Dr. Stacey Simons, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Jordan Davis, demonstrates the trajectory of one of the bullets that pierced his body during trial proceedings . An evidence photograph showing dowels stuck through the bullet holes in the side of the Dodge Durango that Jordan Davis was shot and killed in is displayed on a courtroom monitor during the retrial . He has already been convicted of three counts of attempted second-degree murder and is facing 60 years in prison. Dunn is facing a retrial on the first-degree murder count after the jury deadlocked at the previous trial in February. Giving her testimony, Rouer said that she was buying chips and wine in the convenience store when she 'heard a pop, pop, pop'. She said she didn't know what was going on until she went outside and her fiancee Michael Dunn urged her to get into the car, then drove off quickly, before she could fasten her seatbelt. Earlier this week Dunn's fiancee, Rhonda Rouer, (pictured) told how they went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes straight after the killing . State Attorney Angela Corey shows witness Steven Smith a hat and asked him if he ever saw it above the roof line of the car that Jordan Davis was in during the shooting . Rouer repeated testimony she gave in the first trial, saying the couple, who live together, went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes, then she fell asleep. The next morning when she woke up, the TV was on and she said she saw that Davis had died and she told Dunn she wanted to go home. They drove straight back to Satellite Beach, canceling plans to have lunch with Dunn's son. Dunn was arrested after they returned home that afternoon. The prosecution spent a third day laying out its case that Dunn acted in cold blood when he killed Davis, who was sitting in the rear passenger seat of an SUV next to Dunn's car . Parents: Prosecutor John Guy, right, shakes hands with Jordan Davis's father Ron before the start of the Michael Dunn retrial . Dunn, who had just left his son's wedding, asked Davis and the other teens in the car to turn down the music and a shouting match erupted between Dunn and Davis. The trial was halted briefly Saturday when a juror was dismissed. The dismissal followed a column posted online by Jacksonville alternative publication Folio Weekly that quoted a one-time prospective juror who was not picked after he said he had written for the publication. Richard David Smith III told the publication that the juror who was picked had questioned State Attorney Angela Corey's competence during jury selection and complained about her sense of humor. Judge Russell Healey, Corey and other attorneys involved in the case questioned the columnist and Smith. One of four alternate jurors will replace the dismissed juror.

"Nick Clegg was accused of another U-turn after he said he had abandoned plans for his 'crude' mansion tax levied on £2million homes . Nick Clegg was accused of another U-turn yesterday after he said he had abandoned plans for his 'crude' mansion tax levied on £2million homes. The Lib Dem leader said he was ditching the idea of charging a one per cent levy on the most expensive properties in favour of a 'mini-mansion tax' of adding higher council tax bands. The mansion tax had been enthusiastically backed by Business Secretary Vince Cable. Mr Clegg said: 'I went off, big time, the idea that you have a fixed levy as a percentage over a certain value. The more I looked at it, the more I thought, 'That's very crude.' It leads to eye-watering amounts of tax being paid. 'What we should do is go with the grain of the council tax system and apply bands to higher properties.' Mr Clegg's remarks come after Ed Miliband caused a furore at his party conference last month by pledging to introduce a mansion tax on £2 million homes. Labour is not planning to use the council tax system to apply the tax, leading critics to complain it would hit homeowners who had lived in their properties for a long time and were 'asset rich but cash poor'. Earlier this year, Mr Cable was still arguing that a one per cent tax on property in excess of £2million was his preferred form of mansion tax. But Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander has now lobbied Mr Clegg to introduce new bands starting at, for example, £2million, £4million and £10million. It means the party could also ditch the term 'mansion tax' in favour of 'higher council tax' – although the extra money raised would be siphoned off by the Treasury rather than kept by local authorities. Mr Alexander is due to set out more details over the new plan in his conference speech today. His aides said the new approach was being favoured over the old system because it would be easier to implement. One said: 'It would be simpler to put into action. With a crude mansion tax, you have to know the exact value of everyone's property over £2million. But if you're working with a series of price bands, you wouldn't need to do that.' The Lib Dem leader said he was ditching the idea of charging a one per cent levy on the most expensive properties in favour of a 'mini-mansion tax' of adding higher council tax bands . The revenue from the new system – about £1.7billion – would be roughly the same. Last night Tory MP Peter Bone accused the Lib Dems of a U-turn over the 'shambles' of their 'unfair and unworkable' mansion tax policy – just as Mr Clegg abandoned his pledge to scrap university tuition fees after the last Election. Mr Bone said: 'The one thing voters need to know about is that the Lib Dems want to get more tax off people who have worked hard and bought their own homes. This is a home tax.' He added he was surprised Mr Clegg's party had 'changed policy before an Election – they normally do it afterwards.' The policy change may prompt fears among some Lib Dems that Mr Clegg is trying to water down his tax policy. Last night, sources close to Mr Cable said he was 'not opposed' to the new council tax band version. But they added: 'The devil, of course, will be in the detail of what's proposed.' A succession row broke out among Lib Dems last night as the party leader’s closest ally, Norman Lamb, hinted he’d like the top job. Health Minister Mr Lamb is loyal to Mr Clegg, whom he praises as ‘extraordinarily resilient’. Senior party figures keen to stop Left-wing party president Tim Farron becoming leader have spoken of Mr Lamb as a favourite. Asked if he would stand in a leadership contest, Mr Lamb said: ‘It is not something I am ruthlessly ambitious for, but I don’t rule it out...’ That is political-speak for ‘yes’.","Nick Clegg has abandoned plans for a mansion tax on £2million homes .

"Fara Williams, who stands on the verge of becoming England women’s most capped international, has confessed that she spent six years living rough. The 30-year-old revealed that while spending years slumming it between hostels and living rough, none of her team-mates knew a thing about her plight. ‘I just didn’t want to tell people,’ said Williams, speaking for the first time about her sad past. ‘People have a judgment of who should be homeless and who shouldn’t, and I felt people would judge me. Living rough: England and Liverpool Ladies star Fara Williams has admitted being homeless for six years . ‘I put on a brave face and lived my life as a normal person would, as though I was living at home.’ Williams has been selected for England in the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers as they aim to keep their undefeated record intact against Belarus and Ukraine. With 127 caps to her name, she is just three games away from becoming England’s most-capped player. Yet such fame and glory is a far cry from having to celebrate her 18th and 21st birthdays in hostels. ‘The cause of most homelessness, which people aren’t aware of, is family breakdown — it’s not just addictions,’ said the Liverpool Ladies player. ‘People are mainly scared of the homeless they see on the streets. They’re intimidated by them but they’re normal people with problems. We all have problems.’ Tight-lipped: Fara Williams (C) did not want to tell her England teammates for fear of being judged . Williams’ experiences led her to work with the Homeless FA, where she coaches homeless girls and women every week. ‘To have the opportunity to help these girls is something that I didn’t want to turn down. I wanted to share my story with them and show them that there is a pathway to get out of the situation they’re in,’ explained Williams. ‘It’s hard because you feel sorry for yourself. You feel like no one’s there for you. I had football as my motivation, but some of these don’t have any motivation. I try to show them that there are people out there who want to help them but also they’ve got to help themselves.’","Fara Williams has revealed she spent six years living homeless .

"Mario Mandzukic took a step closer to leaving Bayern Munich today when he was left out of Pep Guardiola's squad for the German Cup final. The 27-year-old Croat is wanted by Arsenal, Chelsea and Real Madrid but Guardiola has dropped him, allegedly for disciplinary reasons. Mandzukic has played a key role for the Bavarians this season, scoring 26 goals in all competitions but also clashed with Guardiola in January when he was excluded from the team.

"The Florida Department of Health has reported its first case of Enterovirus 68 - the life-threatening respiratory illness that has now hospitalized 628 people across 44 states. The 10-year-old girl from Polk County was diagnosed with the deadly illness and spent six days at Tampa General Hospital before being sent home to recover. Jennifer Dunn told ABC Action News on Tuesday she believes her daughter Harleigh was the child with the illness, which carries symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sneezing and body aches. Harleigh, who is now recovering at home, has long suffered from asthma but was airlifted to Tampa General Hospital when she struggled breathing early last month. Scroll down for video . Struck down: Harleigh Dunn was hospitalized with breathing problems in Tampa last month and her mother has said she believes the girl had enterovirus 68. One child has been diagnosed in the state . 'It was difficult to breathe,' Harleigh told ABC Action News. Her mother added: 'This is the worst I've ever, ever seen her. We almost lost her and that's something I think about every day.' She spent six days in hospital and missed two weeks of school but has now returned and doctors have said she is not contagious. Her doctor has not yet given confirmation it was her but the facts match up, Jennifer Dunn said. Others have not survived the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said four people with the disease have died nationwide, although it is not yet clear what role it played in their deaths. In total, 628 people from 44 states and the District of Columbia have been affected, the CDC said. The majority of the cases are believed to be children. Recovering: The girl smiles for the camera after recovering at home following six days in the hospital. The illness has spread to nearly every state and hospitalized more than 600 people . Only Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii and Alaska have not seen any cases. The illness has flu and cold-like symptoms and can cause difficulty breathing for infants and young children, officials have said. The disease can spread through droplets in coughs or sneezes or when someone touches a contaminated surface, such as a countertop or doorknob, according to the Florida Department of Health. Officials said the best way to prevent the disease spreading is by keeping good hygiene such as washing hands and disinfecting surfaces.' Those having cold-like or flu-like symptoms should stay home from child care centers, school or work and, if possible, remain apart from other family members,' Dr. Celeste Philip, deputy secretary for health, said, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Spread: A map from the Centers for Disease Control shows the states (in bold green) that have now reported cases of the illness. Only Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico have had no cases . Four of those infected with the virus have died, including four-year-old Eli Waller, who died last month, according to the Mercer County Medical Examiner's Office in New Jersey. Eli was asymptomatic before his death and the onset of his illness was rapid, according to Hamilton Township Health Officer Jeff Plunkett said. The youngster had stayed home from preschool on September 24 with a case pink eye that the medical examiner found to be unrelated to the virus. That night, he died in his sleep. Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island, died September 22 at Hasbro Children's Hospital and was known to have the illness. The Rhode Island child's death was the result of a bacterial infection, Staphylococcus aureus, that hit the girl in tandem with the virus, Rhode Island officials said in a statement. This enterovirus germ is not new. It was first identified in 1962 and has caused clusters of illness before. Victims: Four-year-old Eli Waller, left, died last month from the illness in New Jersey, while 10-year-old Emily Ortando also had it when she passed away in September. She had a bacterial infection at the same time . Loved: A ribbon and a sign at Yardville Elementary School in Hamilton Township honor little Eli on Saturday . Because it's not routinely tested for, it may have spread widely in previous years without being identified in people who just seemed to have a cold. This year, the virus has gotten more attention because it has been linked to hundreds of severe illnesses. Beginning last month, hospitals in Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago received a flood of children with trouble breathing. Some needed oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine. Many, but not all, had asthma before the infection. Health officials say they have not detected a recent mutation or other change in the virus that would cause it to become more dangerous.

"The World Health Organization (WHO) has admitted it botched attempts to prevent the spread of the deadly Ebola virus and has pinned the blame on some of its own staff. In a draft internal document, the WHO said it should have recognized that traditional infectious disease containment methods would prove ineffective in West Africa because the health systems on the continent were broken. In a blunt assessment of their own failings, the document said: 'Nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall.' The World Health Organization said it should have realized that traditional infectious disease containment methods would prove ineffective in West Africa, as it had broken health systems . Dr. Peter Piot, co-discoverer of Ebola, said WHO acted far too slowly, largely because of its Africa office . It also said the heads of WHO country offices in Africa are 'politically motivated appointments' made by the WHO regional director for Africa, Dr. Luis Sambo, who does not answer to the agency's chief in Geneva, Dr. Margaret Chan. WHO is the U.N.'s specialized health agency, responsible for setting global health standards and coordinating the international response to disease outbreaks. Dr. Peter Piot, the co-discoverer of the Ebola virus, agreed  that WHO acted far too slowly, largely because of its Africa operation. 'It's the regional office in Africa that's the front line. And they didn't do anything. That office is really not competent,' Dr Piot said. Dr Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, also questioned why it took WHO five months and 1,000 deaths before it declared Ebola an international health emergency in August. 'I called for a state of emergency to be declared in July and for military operations to be deployed,' Dr Piot said. Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are the hardest-hit nations in the current outbreak of the deadly virus . But he said WHO might have been scarred by its experience during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, when it was slammed for over-hyping the situation. In late April, during a teleconference on Ebola among infectious disease experts that included WHO, Doctors Without Borders and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, questions were apparently raised about the performance of WHO experts, as not all of them bothered to send Ebola reports to WHO headquarters. WHO said it was 'particularly alarming' that the head of its Guinea office refused to help get visas for an expert Ebola team to come in and $500,000 in aid was blocked by administrative hurdles. Guinea, along with Sierra Leone and Liberia, is one of the hardest-hit nations in the current outbreak, with 843 deaths so far blamed on Ebola. The Ebola outbreak has already killed 4,484 people in West Africa and WHO says within two months there could be new 10,000 cases of Ebola every week unless more measures to fight the outbreak are taken. Ebola is a serious infectious illness which often proves fatal - It can take up anything from two to 21 days for humans with the virus to show symptoms . Other experts said it was impossible to predict that the initial Ebola cases in Guinea would spark the biggest-ever outbreak of the lethal disease. 'There were a lot of mistakes made by WHO but a lot of the best public health minds would have thought we could handle this in July,' said Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota. 'By the time we realized how bad things were, the genie was already out of the bottle,' he said. Osterholm said the U.N. health agency was far from the only organization to blame.","World Health Organization internal document offers blunt assessment .

Talented amateur photographer Daniel Belton, 34, took the pictures in the garden of his parents' home. He said: 'The badgers have been coming to us for about five years or so now. We've never tried to tame them but we do feed them occasionally. 'I try to make sure they are still as wary of us as possible because it wouldn't be good for them to be too used to humans. 'We have about five or six adults at the moment, after they had a batch of cubs last year.' At one point it looked as though the  cub was fiddling with the camera settings as it climbed on the equipment . Mr Belton said he did have a favourite among the badgers - the aptly-named Mrs Badger, who is the matriarch of the group. He said: 'The badger behind the camera was a yearling, I had put peanut butter on the back of the camera with that picture but I was still thrilled when a badger finally got into position and looked as though it was fiddling with the settings. Mr Belton also took some candid shots of the badgers exploring his parents' garden, like this one showing three badgers climbing a tree . 'Because we live in a town we only get the badgers visiting after dark so you have to use some light source. I used to use flash and shoot by remote but now in most of the pictures I use a lamp and hand hold the camera. 'Even with that you are pushing the camera to the limit, what with the badgers being nocturnal, which means it can be frustrating especially with action shots.' The badgers have been visiting the Loughborough garden at night for several years .","Amateur photographer Daniel Belton, 34, says the badgers are regular visitors to his parents' back garden .

"Tim Sherwood has admitted that he wasn't shocked to be sacked by Tottenham, despite leading the club to a sixth-placed finish and qualification for next season's Europa League . Spurs chairman Daniel Levy relieved Sherwood of his duties in a meeting on Tuesday, bringing an end to his spell in charge at White Hart after just five months. And Sherwood, who is already looking forward to getting back into management, insists he has no issue with Levy's decision.

Man in charge: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy informed Sherwood of his decision in a meeting on Tuesday . Speaking as a pundit during ITV 4's Europa League final coverage, Sherwood said: 'Put it this way, I didn't fall off my chair when he (Levy) told me. It wasn't that much of a shock, but it's obviously a disappointment to lose my job. A job that I thought I'd done reasonably well in. 'I have to respect the decision of the club. It's a massive football club. It's going to be bigger than any manager who comes in and any of the players who are there. I've got full respect for their decision.' The 45-year-old enjoyed mixed fortunes on and off the pitch during his time in charge, but he believes the experience of managing in the Premier League has taught him a lot. 'It was a massive learning curve. It was my first opportunity to manage. I did see a transfer window, but I decided not to make any signings,' he said. 'I've seen it all - wins, draws, losses and a few tantrums. And I've seen the sack, which I didn't want to see. I experienced a lot in that five months and I'll certainly learn from it.'

Sherwood is keen to find a new job as soon as possible, with links to the vacancy at Championship side Brighton growing after news of his sacking by Tottenham. He added: 'Peversely I like doing it - anyone who wants to do that job must be crazy. I knew what I was going into - a lot of pressure and it occupies your mind totally. 'You're waking up in the middle of the night thinking of teams - who should play and who shouldn't. But I really liked it and really enjoyed it.

Ms Smith, 28, suffers from a rare stomach condition and has recurring bone tumours which have left her hospitalised in the past. But to help support her working husband and two children, she spends hours each day trawling the internet for competitions and cash saving coupons - entering as many as 800 competitions a day. She said: 'All in all I reckon I bring in £10,000 each year from competitions. I even have a note book at the side of my bed in case I wake in the night thinking about a coupon I haven't tried.' Scroll down for video . Holly Smith shows off some of the thousands of prizes she wins by entering up to 800 competitions a day . Ms Smith, who suffers from a health condition which has prevented her working,  subsidised her wedding using vouchers, coupons and competitions . So far, she has won a trip to Gran Canaria through a Kellogg's competition worth £2,500 and her £70,000 haul of goodies also includes fridge freezers, washing machines, TVs, games consoles and concert tickets. Other prizes have included a three year supply of toothpaste, a six month supply of toilet paper and a five star trip to the Isle of Man worth £2000. The money she saves helps subsidise husband Callum's income as a massage therapist and many of the prizes she wins she donates to charities including the Salvation Army. Even her own wedding was subsidised by her love of coupons and competitions. She won supermarket vouchers which paid for the wedding desserts, she won £1,000 cash toward the reception and hired a luxury wedding car for £40 which normally cost £250 for two days. Ms Smith, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, said: 'I have done really well out of the competitions. I started doing them when I was 21 and only recently took up couponing. I can enter around 100 to even 800 competitions a day. 'We are now on first name terms with the postman because he is delivering something pretty much every day. He doesn't even need to knock on the door now. It really helps me with the pain, to know that something maybe arriving the next day.' Ms Smith suffers from a rare condition that affects around 1,000 people in the UK and causes muscle spasms . Her haul of prizes has included toys and games, which she has started donating to charity . She takes hundreds of pounds off the family's  shopping bill and has won scores of gifts - including DVDs .

She added: 'I bought a dog to have some company and I went on the internet to win something for him in a dog competition. That was the start of my addiction. 'I often wake up in the middle of the night in excruciating pain and entering these competitions really takes my mind off the pain. It happens when the medication wears off. Sometimes I might enter competitions from 1am to 10am. 'I just have to distract myself by doing something and with these competitions you often have to be creative, use your mind to think of funny slogans or come up with reasons why you should win. 'I have been struggling so much with the pain and it really takes my mind off it. I can win anything from dog food to a £2,500 cash prize from Doritos. 'The weirdest thing I have won was a book about the history of roundabout and a DVD about towing a caravan. 'I once won a £5,000 ski trip but I couldn't get insurance due to my leg so I couldn't go.'

'I reckon all in all, out of a proper church wedding with a lovely reception, 80 guests and a chocolate fountain I won £1500 in decorations, craft gear and other things. 'I will have saved thousands with the coupons. The wine on the tables was free with coupons. That is £1,500 I could put toward a £4,500 wedding.' Ms Smith also goes to extreme lengths to cut down on her grocery shopping bill spending four hours each week flitting between supermarkets - much to the delight of her four-year-old daughter. She said: 'I have a massive binder which puts the coupons in date order. It takes us up to 4 hours to do a grocery shop because instead of just buying everything in Tesco like I used to, we go to loads of different supermarkets. We go from Asda to Sainsbury's to Aldi.' Ms Smith's three-year-old daughter, Mollie-Rose, enjoys a windfall of Halloween sweets her mother won . Ms Smith - pictured with husband Callum and daughters Mollie-Rose and Bella-Marie, now two - says the bargain hunting is her way of contributing to the family budget . The family's home in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk is full of stacks of supplies the busy mother has won online . She added: 'My daughter gets really bored because we are doing it for so long that we invented a game called ""spot the win"". She has got really good at it. 'She has to look around the supermarket for things that say ""win"" on it. These are just more opportunities for us to get stuff and save money. 'I just have to distract myself by doing something and with these competitions you often have to be creative, use your mind to think of funny slogans or come up with reasons why you should win. 'We do all kinds of thing to win. Once, to win a trip to Alton Towers we all dressed up in Halloween gear.' 'The best thing about all this is I can always give stuff to my friends and family. I won my husband Callum a trip with British Airways to see ACDC in Germany. 'It was all paid for and he loved it. I won a luxury trip worth £2500 to Jersey and I gave it my mum for 60th birthday - she had the best time ever.'

"ITV has defended its decision not to include any female presenters in its line-up of on-screen talent at this summer’s World Cup. The broadcaster yesterday unveiled its team of presenters and pundits who will travel to Brazil to present coverage of one of the world’s biggest sporting event, which is expected to attract millions of viewers per game. Former Daybreak host Adrian Chiles will head a 16-strong team which includes regular ITV pundits Roy Keane and Lee Dixon as well as a host of other former players such as Ian Wright, Glenn Hoddle and Gordon Strachan. It's a man's World Cup: Adrian Chiles will head a 16-strong team which includes regular ITV pundits Roy Keane and Lee Dixon as well as other former players such as Ian Wright, Glenn Hoddle and Gordon Strachan . They will be joined by reporter Gabriel Clarke, presenter Matt Smith and commentators Clive Tyldesley and Sam Matterface, who will all help present coverage of the 34 live games being broadcast by ITV during the month-long tournament. Last week the BBC unveiled its own line-up of presenters and pundits for the World Cup, which includes two women; long-time sports presenter Gabby Logan and Juliette Ferrington. Sky also include several high-profile female presenters on its football coverage, most notably on its rolling news channel, Sky Sports News. However, a spokesman for ITV defended the move on Tuesday, saying it had assembled the best team for the job. They . said: ‘We have an established and experienced on screen presenter and . reporter team who have led our broadcasts throughout England's . qualifying campaign as they will in Brazil. First-class males: ITV defended the move, saying it had assembled the best team for the job . ‘In . line with sport coverage across all media, our pundits tend to be drawn . from key figures currently or formerly involved with the game at the . highest level and we believe we have a first class World Cup line up . from a range of backgrounds. 'Whenever opportunities arise to bring in new people for ITV Sport, our aim is always to get the best we can.’ During the last World Cup held in South Africa in 2010, ITV employed reporter Kelly Cates to help present its coverage. However, the broadcaster will only take one reporter to this year’s event. On message: The BBC line-up for World Cup 2014 includes Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Lineker, Thierry Henry, Gabby Logan, and Alan Hansen . Speaking at the launch of ITV’s World Cup team of presenters, Chiles said of the lack of female reporters: ‘It is a fair point, but the BBC are taking four reporters. We are not taking any because it comes down to cost. ‘If we did have four reporters I am sure we would have a women on the team. But we are not we are taking one who is Gabriel [Clarke] who will be with England. It comes down to numbers. ‘Who are you going to take off our panel? I think it is difficult. If we had a bigger team there would definitely be female involvement. Some of our biggest operators behind the scenes are women. The head count tells a different story. It is not sexist business as far as I am concerned. 'Most of the Albion fans I watch the game with week in week out are women. ‘I don't know if you'd call it a boys' club, we have got a lot of our key players behind the scenes are women actually.’","Former Daybreak host Chiles will .

"Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, who was already accused of murder in a man's shooting death last year, 'ambushed and executed' two other men a year earlier after an encounter at a nightclub, prosecutors said Thursday in announcing new murder charges against Hernandez in their deaths. The arrest of Hernandez on a murder charge last year stunned the American sports world. Hernandez earned big money as a star for the Boston area's New England Patriots, one of the most successful teams in recent years in the National Football League, by far the most popular pro sports league in the US. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Aaron Hernandez charged with double homicide . Charged: Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been charged with murder in connection with the shooting of two men - he was already in jail awaiting charges for another murder last June . In the new charges, Hernandez is accused of shooting Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado, two Cape Verdean nationals, to death as they sat in a car in Boston's trendy South End on July 16, 2012. Police have said they were shot by someone who drove up alongside in an SUV with Rhode Island license plates and opened fire. Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley said in announcing that Hernandez has been indicted that the victims were 'ambushed and executed as they drove home' and that Hernandez was the gunman. Weeks later, Hernandez signed a five-year deal worth about $40 million with the Patriots and went on to play 12 games as a tight end for the team that season. Fallen: Hernandez (left) was a hugely talented player who had a $40m contract with the Patriots . Lawyers for Hernandez, who is awaiting trial in the separate 2013 shooting death near his home of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd in Massachusetts, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment about the new indictment. Hernandez is being held without bail after pleading not guilty to murder in Lloyd's death. On the night of the 2012 attack, Hernandez and the victims encountered each other at a nightclub, Conley said, though he did not detail what happened. Hernandez was seen on surveillance footage in the nightclub that night, authorities have said. Boston police wrote in an affidavit last year there is probable cause to believe that Hernandez was driving a vehicle used in the double shooting. The affidavit was filed as police sought to search an SUV involved in the shooting and found at Hernandez's uncle's home in Bristol, Connecticut. Execution: Charges state that Hernandez used a handgun yo 'ambush and execute' two men after they left a Boston nightclub and were driving home . The SUV was covered in dust and cobwebs and had a dead battery, leading police to believe it had remained untouched in the garage for close to a year, according to the court document. Survivor Aquilino Freire told police an SUV pulled up next to them while they were stopped, and he saw someone in the SUV's back seat laughing, according to the affidavit. Then, several gunshots were fired from the rear passenger seat into the car, Freire told police. Two other people in the car ran away, Freire said. Hernandez had long been famous as an American football star in the New England region, dating back to his school years in Connecticut.

"A California man accused of posing as an actor from the 'Twilight' movie franchise to lure young girls pleaded not guilty Tuesday to federal child pornography charges. David LaVera, 33, appeared in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, on charges of sexual exploitation of a child and possession of child pornography. The bogus actor entered not guilty pleas to both counts against him. LaVera allegedly pretended to be Kiowa Gordon, 24, who played minor character Embry in three Twilight films. Back in court: David LaVera, 33, pictured here with one of the alleged victims, Raven Adams, appeared in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, on charges of sexual exploitation of a child and possession of child pornography . Jasper County Sheriff John Halferty said LaVera has been turned over to U.S. marshals, Des Moines Register reported. LaVera, . of San Diego, already has pleaded not guilty to Iowa charges of sexual . abuse, sexual exploitation of a minor, enticing a minor, carrying . weapons and failure to have a valid driver's license. He . is also accused of using a smartphone to record a 12-year-old girl and a . 14-year-old taking a shower and using the bathroom. The lewd videos . were then uploaded onto LaVera’s laptop, according to a criminal . complaint. The 33-year-old suspect will go on trial in the federal case beginning December 1. Iowa prosecutors may dismiss state charges depending on the outcome of LaVera's federal trial, Judge Halferty said. David LaVera was arrested in August . after he allegedly convinced a 14-year-old girl to get into his car. The victim's sister called their mother to tell them the teen had left . with LaVera. The mother, April Roush, called police. Mr . LaVera and the teen were spotted on the outskirts of town by one of Ms . Roush's friends, who stood in front of his car and demanded the girl . come with her. After she was safely out of LaVera's vehicle, he sped away. Sheriff's deputies caught up with him a short time later. In his car, they found two swords and four daggers. Ms Roush credited her friend who rescued her daughter with saving the girl's life. Cheap tricks: LaVera came to Berg Middle School in Iowa in May and performed tricks while pretending to be a movie stuntman . Poser: LaVera (left) took pictures with students at the school during his visit . 'I don't think I would have ever seen my daughter again. And if so, it would have been to bury her,' she told WHO. Ms . Roush says she her daughter was so convinced that LaVera was the . Twilight star that she still believes Kiowa Gordon was the one who came . to pick her up. He allegedly had chatted with the teenager over Facebook before driving 26 hours from California to Iowa to meet her. Tammy Adams said that prior to this incident, LaVera also tried the same moves on her teenage daughter, Raven, on June 3. Ms Adams told USA Today that LaVera told her daughter he was the Twilight star and convinced her and a friend to go to a park with him, where he touched her inappropriately. The 33-year-old allegedly asked the teenager if they could meet up at night to make out. The girl planned to stay at a friend's and sneak out to meet him but her mother found out and called the police in Newton. Raven Adams, who attends Berg Middle School, told USA Today: 'They didn't do anything about it. If they had, I don't think this would have happened to this other girl.' After Tammy Adams contacted the police, an officer found LaVera at a bar and gave him a verbal warning but did not arrest him. He was allegedly signing autographs and taking pictures with his 'fans' at the time. Lt. Bill Henninger said in August he believed that LaVera had been introducing himself both by his real name but had convinced others, in particular groups of teenagers, that he was Kiowa Gordon and signing autographs in his name. David LaVera, 33, (left) was allegedly posing as hunky actor Kiowa Gordon, 24, who played a small role in three of the Twilight Saga films (right) Raven Adams met the actor at her school on May 28 where he was brought by a parents of a student. He was introduced to students as David LaVera, a stuntman from California, before he signed autographs and performed stunts at assembly. On May 29, Raven Adams posted a pictured with the actor on her Facebook page. In the comments below, when asked who he was, she wrote: 'A guy that plays in twilight... he played embry call.' One commenter wrote: 'And have you looked at a picture of embry from the movie... just looks diff.' The teen replied: 'He is older it was like 5 and six years ago and he is a stunt double he filled in for the kne [sic] who broke his legs he was young tho.' She added: 'He came to the school he is a family friend of a students his parents met him somewhere and they became really good friends.' It is unclear, after being introduced as LaVera, how the man managed to convince the teenage girls that he was Kiowa Gordon. According to the Internet Movie Database, LaVera has appeared in 13 movies, including  Die Fighting, Fortune 500 Man and a non-speaking role in Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.","David LaVera, 33, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of sexual exploitation of a child and possession of child pornography .

"A middle school teacher whose skull was shattered three months ago when teens allegedly dropped a 5lb rock from a highway overpass onto her car is finally ready to head home. Sharon Budd, her relatives and medical staff appeared outside Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania on Tuesday to speak about her incredible battle. Helped by two staff members, she grinned as she rang a ceremonial victory bell. The 52-year-old mother and breast cancer survivor plans to return home to Uniontown, Ohio on Wednesday. Celebration: Sharon Budd rings a ceremonial victory bell outside Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania on Tuesday - signaling that she is ready to return home after three months . On the road to recovery: Mrs Budd has been recovering for three months after a rock was thrown from an Interstate 80 overpass in Pennsylvania and shattered her skull. She lost her right eye in the incident . When previously asked what was the first thing she wanted when she got home, she told PennLive: 'A loaf of bread and an entire package of English muffins. I'll stand by the toaster for an hour and a half.' She was the front-seat passenger of her family's car as it drove through Danville on July 10 with her husband and daughter, when the rock crashed through the front window and struck her head. Budd, who had just finished speaking to her son before he was deployed to Afghanistan, suffered a crushed skull and brain damage. She also lost her right eye. She has endured five surgical procedures to repair the damage - including the removal of a portion of her facial bones to ease the brain swelling - but has suffered setbacks with seizures. Support: She is pictured with her husband Randy ahead of her departure from the rehab center . Excitement: Randy Budd speaks to his wife on Tuesday as she prepares to head back home to Ohio . Strength-to-strength: Mrs Budd suffered brain damage but is able to manage simple math, her husband said . Her husband Randy said on Tuesday that her sense of humor has returned, she is able to walk and she has regained limited vision in her left eye. Her long-term prognosis remains uncertain. 'They told us to look at this a year from now to give a measurement of how Sharon's going to be, who is Sharon going to be,' Randy Budd said. She can perform simple math and knows who the president is and that it's 2014, Randy Budd said. But she can be confused about how many children she has or how she got hurt, he said. 'Some basics, she doesn't have,' Randy Budd said. 'That's to be expected. The brain has to reconnect itself.' But there are encouraging signs so far, he said: 'She could have come back bitter, violent, aggressive, but she came back as kind of her sweet self.' Life-changing: Sharon is pictured left with her husband Randy and right before the July 10 crash in Danville . Injuries: A scan shows how Mrs Budd's skull was shattered after she was hit by the massive rock . By her side: An image shared by family shows the Budds dancing in Sharon's hospital room in September . She rang a ceremonial victory bell Tuesday at Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital, and then started the five-hour drive west to Uniontown, Ohio, where friends and neighbors will greet her. 'This word gets thrown around a lot, but I really believe the angels came down to help her,' he said. Four young men face charges in the attack. One of them testified at a preliminary hearing in August that they set out to do damage that day, starting with shoplifting and driving through a corn field and ending up on the Interstate 80 overpass shortly before midnight. Keefer McGee, 18, testified under a deal with prosecutors that they laughed as they drove away from the scene after hearing the noise of the rock hitting the Budd family's vehicle. Proud: Sharon Budd, left, was struck by a rock thrown from an overpass as her family drove on I-80. Moments before, she had spoken with her son Lucas (right), who has been deployed to Afghanistan . Fighter: Mrs Budd, pictured with her husband, three sons and a daughter, will return to Ohio on Wednesday . 'They weren't looking for a car to hit in particular,' said McGee, who told the judge he had been involved in unspecified earlier rock-throwing incidents. 'Like, they weren't waiting for one. They hit one as they saw it.' He drove them back to the Lahr home, where they began to watch a movie before deciding to return to the scene to see what happened — twice. During one of those trips, an alert police officer noted their license plate, leading investigators to the four. Budd's husband Randy recalled the horror of that evening during the hearing. 'It felt like an explosion,' he testified, calling his wife's injuries the 'most gruesome thing that I've ever seen.' 'I'm pretty sure I was looking at brains and skull and she, remarkably, kind of came to but wasn't saying anything,' he said. 'She was just jerking, grabbing her head, so we were holding her hands down.' Accused: Brett Lahr, 18, left, and his brother, 17-year-old Dylan Lahr, and two others have been charged with aggravated assault and conspiracy charges in the shocking incident three months ago . One of the four told police that the oblong-shaped rock was dropped by Dylan Lahr, 17. The lawyer for the only defendant who did not waive his preliminary hearing, Brett Lahr, 19, said this week he was glad to hear Sharon Budd was being released but maintains criminal charges should not have been filed against him. 'Just because you're riding along with people who do some stuff, and even alleged to have laughed if it happened, which we dispute, does not mean you should be even tried for a crime,' said the defense attorney, Brian Manchester. 'You have to have some active involvement.'","Sharon Budd was in the front passenger seat as she traveled through Pennsylvania with her husband and daughter on July 10 .

"A mother-of-two has spoken of how irritable bowel syndrome left her in agony and killed her sex life. Tiffany Crawford, 45, had suffered from the condition since the birth of her younger daughter Becky 12 years ago. She lived with a constantly bloated stomach and persistent pain down her right side, which left her feeling miserable. Pain: Tiffany Crawford with her husband, Andrew. She suffered excruciating IBS symptoms after the birth of her second daughter 12 years ago, leaving her feeling unattractive . She told MailOnline: 'The pain was horrific. It was on my right side - where the belt loop is when you wear jeans. I used to say I wanted to go in with an apple corer and pull it out.' Eight years ago it became so bad that she was hospitalised. Doctors quickly diagnosed her with IBS, prescribing her with diclofenic anti-inflammatory tablets. One in five people in the Western world suffers with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a gut disorder characterised by diarrhoea, stomach cramps and bloating. And while the painkillers helped with the pain slightly, they did nothing to ease her severe bloating. Happier times: Tiffany and Andrew when they were younger. She says their relationship is now back on track after she discovered a treatment for her IBS symptoms, which had left her bloated and not wanting sex . Mrs Crawford said: 'I was so bloated that . I couldn't wear jeans in the car if I was going on a long journey as it . was so painful. I would feel like I had eaten a really, really big meal, . even though I hadn't. 'And whenever I ate anything like bread, my symptoms would flare up. I regularly found myself  doubled over with pain for three to four days whenever I ate white bread and had to resort to cutting it out completely. 'I wouldn't be able to go to the loo for three or four days at a time, either.' The pain and bloating left her feeling miserable and unattractive - and her relationship with her husband Andrew, 44, also suffered. Many women (with and without IBS) experience variations in gut symptoms – . including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, bloating, and constipation – during . their menstrual cycle. Abdominal pain and diarrhoea tend to increase in . the pre-menstrual phase of the cycle and reach a maximum on the first to . second day of menstrual flow. Bloating and constipation, on the other . hand, tend to increase post-ovulation (around day 14) and stay increased . until the day before or the first day of menstrual flow. Source: aboutibs.org . She said: 'Between the stomach ache and the fact it felt like a balloon and looked awful, I just didn't feel sexy or have any enthusiasm in the bedroom. 'I was always scared that sex would hurt and that put me off doing it. In the end, I just didn't want to do it at all - and didn't for about two years.' She says that stress made her symptoms worse - and the fact her husband had been diagnosed with a cavernoma - clusters of abnormal blood vessels around the brain - plaguing him with constant headaches on a daily basis, only made matters worse. 'I do think the stress of Andrew's illness made my IBS symptoms worse,' she said. Although very much under-reported, one of the most common side-effects of IBS is a low sex drive. Many patients, both men and women, also say the condition makes sex painful, too. A recent survey by TalkHealth revealed that one in three women with IBS also have such embarrassing symptoms that their sex life suffers as a result, leading to strained relationships. The survey also demonstrated that the majority's self confidence had dwindled since their diagnosis. Struggle: Tiffany with her daughters Becky and Katie. She says her IBS often left her doubled over in pain . Relief: Since discovering a supplement she takes in her morning cup of tea, Tiffany's symptoms have disappeared and she is no longer in agony . Frustrated with no solution for her . swollen stomach, Mrs Crawford began searching online for an answer - and . found a 'good bacteria' supplement on Facebook. Called Bimuno, it's a prebiotic, which 'feeds' probiotics - so-called ‘friendly’ or ‘good’ bacteria which play a number of vital roles in the body including helping to regulate the immune system, aiding the digestion and absorption of food, producing essential vitamins, and contributing to digestive health. Happy: Tiffany says all aspects of her life have improved . Prebiotics are a special type of complex carbohydrate that probiotics thrive on. They feed and increase the ‘good’ types of bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria without feeding the ‘bad’ types. Mrs Crawford said: 'I got sent a sample pack of the prebiotic powder and added it to my cup of tea in the morning. 'Within days I felt so much better and don't even need to take it every day. 'The pain has gone, my stomach has got flatter and I can eat bread and my favourite foods again, such as baguettes, brioche and croissants. 'Best of all, Andrew and I now have a much better relationship and things are really good in the bedroom again.' Last year, she forgot to take Bimuno over the Christmas period, due to the stress of the holidays. 'My symptoms returned instantly and I was doubled over with stomach pains, struggling to even stand up straight. 'Within hours of taking the powder my symptoms had vanished. It seems to be the only thing that keeps them under control.'","Tiffany Crawford, 45, developed the condition 12 years ago after childbirth .

"An amateur hypnotist allegedly had sex with a woman after he hypnotized her. Kevin Christian Geyer, 25, pleaded not guilty to indecent liberties in Benton County Superior Court, Washington on Wednesday - even though his victim claims he  apologized for the alleged attack. The woman, who has not been identified, had visited Geyer's home in Kennewick several times for hypnotism to help her with problems she was having. During a visit on June 4, Geyer allegedly put her under a state of hypnosis and told her to block out all of her senses except her hearing, the Tri-City Herald reported. Denial: Kevin Geyer pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting a woman he had hypnotized at his home. She says that after their appointment, she had images of him assaulting her and found evidence on her clothes . When he woke her, she was fully clothed. But she told authorities that she later had vague memories of Geyer sexually assaulting her and found evidence of the assault on her clothes. She texted him to ask him about the alleged attack and he apologized, police said. When authorities contacted him, he also admitted to touching her and expressed remorse, according to court documents. His charge of indecent liberties stems from him allegedly having sexual contact with a person who is incapable of consent because they are mentally incapacitated or physically helpless. Geyer's trial will begin in January. He is out of custody but has been ordered to have no contact with the woman for a year.","Kevin Christian Geyer, an amateur hypnotist, 'had sex with the woman after she visited his Washington home for treatment in June'

"A North Carolina woman nearly died after giving birth last month, when a blood clot in her leg shot straight to her lungs and she suffered a pulmonary embolism. New mom Shelly Cawley survived the brush with death however, since she was already in an incubated sleep for the c-section and doctors were able to stabilize her condition. Two days short of baby Rylan's one-month birthday, Mrs Cawley and her little girl were able to leave the hospital after recovering from the clot. Scroll down for video . Going home: Shelly Cawley was discharged from the hospital this week, a month after suffering a pulmonary embolism during a c-section birth . In an interview with WBTV, Mrs Cawley describes what happened in the moments after her emergency c-section on September 5. She believes the weight of the baby had been blocking a blood clot in her leg, and once that weight was lifted the clot shot straight to her lungs - filling them with fluid. 'Somewhere in those next moments the little bit of fluid in her lungs became a lot and all the doctors I talked to said if she wasn't already incubated and already put to sleep she would have died,' her husband Jeremy said. Close call: Doctors say Mrs Cawley survived the blood clot because she was already in an incubated sleep. Above, pictures of her recovery posted to Facebook . Mrs Cawley says a crucial part of her recovery was hearing her newborn daughter cry, which brought her back to life to fight. 'Really what we did was, we got Rylan to cry as much as she could, and we prayed together. And you could see the doctors and nurses taking their time to pray as well,' Jeremy said. 'I know that her vitals were completely backwards her blood pressure was way bottomed out, her heart rate was sky high. They told us since then she knew Rylan was there. And she reacted to Rylan being there. And that reaction helped her fight enough until they could get the other doctors involved from CMC Main.' 'I've been told the story - by putting her on my chest and making her cry was what brought me back,' Mrs Cawley said. On Friday, Mrs Cawley was finally cleared to leave the hospital and she was greeted outside by over 200 of her friends, family and supporters wearing purple 'Team Shelly' shirts. The group said a prayer before the Cawleys left to bring their new girl home. Life saver: Mrs Cawley says her daughter Rylan helped save her because sounds of her crying brought her back to life to fight the blood clot .","Shelly Cawley suffered a pulmonary embolism last month, after giving birth to daughter Rylan via c-section .

"Blastoff for the spacecraft which could one day take humans to Mars is set for the final countdown as Nasa moved the huge Delta IV Heavy rocket that will launch it into space onto the famous Cape Canaveral launch pad. It will blast the experimental capsule in orbit - although the rockets are then expected to be replaced by Nasa's even bigger Space Launch system. 'We've been working toward this launch for months, and we're in the final stretch,' said Kennedy Director Bob Cabana. Scroll down for video . The Delta IV Heavy rocket (left), built by United Launch Alliance, made its move Tuesday night, to nearby Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. During its Dec. 4 test flight, the unmanned capsule will shoot more than 3,600 miles into space. It will then take two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph and parachuting into the Pacific off the San Diego coast. During the two-orbit, four-hour mission, engineers will evaluate the systems critical to crew safety, the launch abort system, the heat shield and the parachute system. The data gathered during the mission will influence design decisions and validate existing computer models. The flight also will reduce overall mission risks and costs for later Orion flights. The capsule will re-enter Earth's atmosphere at speeds approaching 20,000 mph, generating temperatures as high as 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The Delta IV Heavy rocket, built by United Launch Alliance, made its move on Tuesday night to nearby Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The rocket's three Common Booster Cores were tested, processed and attached to each other to form the first stage that will connect to Orion's service module. It then was raised Wednesday from the horizontal position into its vertical launch configuration. 'Orion is almost complete and the rocket that will send it into space is on the launch pad. 'We're 64 days away from taking the next step in deep space exploration.' Orion was moved Sunday out of the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida as its launch abort system was fitted. This system is designed to protect astronauts if a problem arises during launch by pulling the spacecraft away from the failing rocket. During the December, uncrewed flight, the jettison motor, which separates the launch abort system from the crew module in both normal operations and emergency, will be tested. For Orion's dry run, the Lockheed Martin Corp.-built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast, and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays. Once the launch abort system is stacked on the completed crew and service modules, and the three systems are tested together, the Orion spacecraft will be considered complete. It then will wait inside the launch abort system facility until mid-November, when the Delta IV Heavy rocket is ready for integration with the spacecraft. Meanwhile Orion was moved Sunday out of the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida as its launch abort system was fitted. The three common booster cores are 134 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter. Each has an RS-68 engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant producing 656,000 pounds of thrust. All totaled, the three Delta IV boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust. The second stage of the Delta IV rocket is 45 feet in length and 17 feet in diameter. It uses one RL10-B-2 engine, also burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant creating 25,000 pounds of thrust. The three primary core elements of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Delta IV Heavy rocket have now been put together, forming the first stage of the launch vehicle that will send Orion far from Earth to allow NASA to evaluate the spacecraft's performance in space. The three Delta IV Common Booster Cores were attached in ULA's Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF), at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The HIF building is located at Space Launch Complex 37 where the mission will lift off. The first booster was attached to the center rocket in June with the second one was attached in early August. 'The day-to-day processing is performed by ULA,' said Merri Anne Stowe of Nasa's Fleet Systems Integration Branch of the Launch Services Program (LSP). 'Nasa's role is to keep a watchful eye on everything and be there to help if any issues come up.' Stowe explained that during major testing experts from Nasa's Launch Services Program monitor the work on consoles in Hanger AE at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Hangar AE is home to the Kennedy Space Center's upgraded Launch Vehicle Data Center. The facility allows engineers to monitor voice, data, telemetry and video systems that support expendable launch vehicle missions. The huge Delta IV Heavy rocket w earlier this week put together for the first time at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida ahead of a first test flight of the Orion capsule in December, a mission known as Exploration Flight Test-1. NASA's Florida spaceport is also where Orion was built and is being processed. The Delta IV rocket stages were assembled at the ULA plant in Decatur, Alabama, about 20 miles west of Huntsville. After completion, the rocket components were shipped down the Tennessee River and Tombigbee Waterway, a canal, to the Gulf of Mexico. From there they traveled to Cape Canaveral, arriving on May 6. The elements of the rocket's first stage were then transported to the HIF for preflight processing. 'After the three core stages went through their initial inspections and processing, the struts were attached, connecting the booster stages with the center core,' Stowe said. For Orion's dry run, the Lockheed Martin Corp.-built capsule will have hunks of aluminum in place of seats for ballast, and simulators instead of actual cockpit displays. A Delta IV rocket will do the heavy lifting. It will eventually be launced by Nasa's new Space Launch System 'megarocket'. For its first flight test, SLS will be configured for a 70-metric-ton (77-ton) lift capacity and carry an uncrewed Orion spacecraft beyond low-Earth orbit. In its most powerful configuration, SLS will provide an unprecedented lift capability of 130 metric tons (143 tons), which will enable missions even farther into our solar system, including such destinations as an asteroid and Mars. When asked by a reporter, Cabana said he wishes Orion's flight pace was quicker. 'But it is what it is,' he said. 'Given the budget that we have, I think we've got the best program that you could imagine.' Orion has its roots in the post-Columbia shuttle era; it originated a decade ago as a crew exploration vehicle to get astronauts beyond low Earth orbit and managed to survive the cancellation of the Constellation moon project.","Three Delta IV boosters collectively generate 1.96 million pounds of thrust .

"Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor has blasted Yaya Toure and his Ivory Coast team-mates for trying to be heroes rather than playing together. The Togolese striker was hugely critical of a squad brimming with Premier League stars including Kolo Toure, Cheick Tiote and Wilfried Bony, as well as former Premier League stars Didier Drogba and Gervinho. 'I never trust them. They are the country that will always let you down,' said Adebayor speaking to Ghana SoccerNet. Let down: Emmanuel Adebayor (below) has blasted the Ivory Coast for not playing together . Blast: The Spurs striker said the team need to play together and not all try and be heroes . He added: 'How come for the last four or five years have they not won the African Cup of Nations? They have got the best striker in Europe in Didier Drogba. They have got the best midfielder today, Yaya Toure. You’ve got one of the best strikers in the league today, Wilfried Bony. You have all of those players. 'But the thing is, are they going to be collective enough? I don’t know. I am not an Ivorian. They will be talking, laughing and enjoying themselves but when the time comes, they will forget about their job.' Adebayor rates Nigeria's chances as the best among the five African nations, because they have the best 'concentration', while Ghana, whose squad is full of European players, much like the Ivory Coast, are over-reliant on Asamoah Gyan. Individual: Ivory Coast have not won the Africa Cup of Nations since 1992 despite having a number of stars . Best chance: Adebayor believes Nigeria have the best chance in Brazil because they are the most organised . Continuing his Ivory Coast criticism, Adebayor added: 'There’s no togetherness. Everyone wants to be the hero. 'Everybody wants to be the one to finish on a high so the folks remember them for what I have done, not for what we have done as a generation, nor for what we have done as team.

"June Weatherman, 50, has been jailed for seven years after being found guilty of posing as a doctor to stealing from elderly cancer patients . A woman who posed as a hospital doctor to steal from the bedsides of ill and dying patients was jailed for seven years today. June Weatherman stole from elderly cancer patients, mostly aged in the eighties, taking their bank cards before withdrawing thousands of pounds from their accounts. When she was arrested she tried to claim she was only being targeted because she was mixed race, but was ultimately convicted of 15 charges of theft and fraud at Guilford Crown Court. Prosecuter Ruby Selva said that Weatherman, 50, had stalked the corridors of hospitals across the South of England looking for opportunities to steal handbags and wallets. She said: 'June Weatherman carried out a string of dishonest offences over a period of time under rather mean circumstances.' The jury of seven men and five women heard how Weatherman had 'brazenly' targeted people who were recovering from surgery and general anaesthetic or were too ill to know what was happening. Her victims were elderly, mostly aged in their 80s, and two - Linda Connor and Aileen Henderson - went on to die from their illnesses. Pamela Verrinder was aged 87 when she had her handbag stolen from her room at St Peter’s Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey, last September, the jury heard. Weatherman had already admitted using Mrs Verrinder’s HSBC card on 119 occasions to buy £6,322 of goods, and CCTV footage was played to the jury of her stalking the corridors at the hospital. While recovering from surgery at St Mark’s Hospital, Harrow, in September last year, Jean Cooper had her mobile phone, purse and its contents taken while she was unable to speak. Jurors were shown CCTV of Weatherman in the hospital that day, where an ATM withdrawal on Ms Cooper’s NatWest card was declined. 'She is, in effect, caught red-handed using Jean Cooper’s card,' said Miss Selva. After being arrested, Weatherman claimed she was only being targeted because she was mixed race, but hospital CCTV (pictured) and mobile phone records linked her to the crimes . She used other stolen bank cards to fraudulently withdraw money at locations in Essex, Cambridgeshire, Kent and London. Police obtained mobile phone evidence tying numbers associated with Weatherman to the locations and dates of the crimes she was alleged to have committed. In interviews following her arrest on in January , Weatherman, of no fixed address but originally from Essex, claimed she had been set up and that she was being targeted because she is mixed race. Temporary Detective Sergeant Andy Jenkins, said: 'I would like to thank the members of the public who came forward to identity June Weatherman - it is without doubt that their information was crucial in helping us bring this woman to justice. 'Weatherman’s brazen actions in targeting and deceiving elderly and vulnerable patients whilst in the process of receiving medical care were particularly callous acts on her part - the impact this sort of offence can have on the victims and their families cannot be underestimated. 'I hope that the custodial sentence given to Weatherman today acts as a deterrent to anyone considering preying on the vulnerable in such a cold and calculated manner and also illustrates the seriousness of these crimes.'","June Weatherman, 50, stole phones, credit cards and cash from hospitals .

"Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal has instructed the club to make midfield and defence their priority in their recruitment drive. While soundings have been made for Arjen Robben and Edinson Cavani, Van Gaal hopes Luke Shaw's transfer can be wrapped up with the finer details of the £27million fee to be finalised. However, scouts have also been busy compiling reports on members of his Holland squad for scrutiny by the club's hierarchy ahead of possible bids. Dutch legion: Louis van Gaal is eyeing Holland defender Daryl Janmaat (left) at Manchester United . Potential: Bruno Martins Indi has been watched by United but Stefan de Vrij (right) is going to join Lazio . Options open: Roma's Kevin Strootman remains a firm favourite within Old Trafford this summer . Feyenoord centre-back Bruno Martins Indi is one while his teammate Daryl Janmaat, the right-back, has also been watched. Their club mate and fellow defender Stefan de Vrij has been linked with United but he is likely to sign for Lazio over the coming days. A deal for Roma's Kevin Strootman remains on the cards once he proves he is recuperating well from his knee ligament injury. David Moyes had a deal agreed in principle for Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos and that should still go through. Wolfsburg, meanwhile, have agreed a deal with Eintracht Frankfurt for right-back Sebastian Jung who has been attracting interest from Arsenal and United. ......................................................................... Leicester City are showing interest in Dutch goalscoring sensation Lars Veldwijk. The 6ft 5ins striker plays for Excelsior in Holland's second division but has grabbed the attention of scouts by scoring 30 goals in 38 games this season. The 22-year-old was close to joining Roda in January but ultimately Excelsior rejected the bids.Leicester are keen to bring in a target man after having a bid rejected for Brighton's Leonardo Ulloa, however, they will face competition for Veldwijk from Midlands neighbours Nottingham Forest. Incoming manager Stuart Pearce has been spotted at recent Excelsior games and he is looking to recruit a striker for the new season. On the hunt for a netter: Leicester City are showing interest in Dutch goalscoring sensation Lars Veldwijk . Standard Liege striker Michy Batshuayi is unlikely to sign for Swansea despite an apparent £7 million deal being agreed between the clubs. The Belgium U21 international is highly regarded and is hoping bigger clubs firm up their interest. Everton and Arsenal both remain keen but have been pursuing other strikers of late. The 20-year-old has scored 19 goals this season. Swansea have an interest in in Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski with Michel Vorm expected to join Liverpool, as reported in Sportsmail, while Swansea are also keen on Stephen Kingsley and Will Vaulks from Scottish side Falkirk. Replace: Swansea have an interest in in Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski with Michel Vorm expected to leave . Wishful thinking: Standard Liege's Michy Batshuayi is unlikely to join Garry Monk's Swansea City . Liverpool's Luis Alberto is wanted on loan by Malaga. The 21-year-old was a £7million signing from Sevilla last summer but has barely figured for Liverpool during their charge towards Premier League runners up. Alberto is attracting interest from a lot of Spanish sides after impressing during his loan with Barcelona B in 2012-13. Liverpool are looking to strengthen their squad ahead of next season's Champions League campaign and are considering other wide players which will push Alberto further down the pecking order. Zoltan Gera is weighing up a return to his native Hungary with Ferencvaros. The 35-year-old was one of several players to be released by West Bromwich Albion last week and he has held talks about a possible return to the club where he made 115 appearances between 2000 and 2004. The free agent is also exploring possible options to remain in England. Weighing up: Zoltan Gera is mulling over a move to Ferencvaros after being released by West Brom . On the way out? Newcastle could sell Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa this summer and want Romanian Stefan Radu . Too much? The Magpies are keen on Stoke's Ryan Shawcross but have yet to lodge a bid . Newcastle United have expressed an interest in Romania defender Stefan Radu. The Lazio centre-back has been linked with Tottenham and Manchester United but the main interest has been from Fiorentina who are keen on him and Thomas Vermaelen of Arsenal. Lazio are ready to sell Radu, 27, because his contract runs out in 2016 and he has not shown a willingness to re-negotiate. They do not want to risk him running down his deal so will sell for £8 million. Newcastle are looking to improve their centre-back options with Stephen Taylor and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa possibly being sold later in the window. They are keen on Stoke City defender Ryan Shawcross but have yet to bid. .......................................................................... AC Milan have rekindled interest in Newcastle full-back Davide Santon while Monaco remain keen on Mathieu Debuchy.

"Norwich are facing a fight to keep John Ruddy at the club for their tilt at an instant Premier League return. The goalkeeper will consider his future at the Carrow Road should a Premier League club offer him regular first-team football next season.

"Louis Van Gaal has revealed he came ‘very close’ to taking over at Tottenham Hotspur before agreeing to become the new Manchester United manager. The Holland head coach said he was tempted by the proposition having supported Spurs as a child because of an admiration for England striker Jimmy Greaves and the club’s ‘fantastic white shirts’. Daniel Levy held talks with Van Gaal at the turn of the year but the Dutchman opted to move instead to Old Trafford once David Moyes was sacked. Tempted: Louis van Gaal has revealed he came 'very close'to taking over at Spurs before joining Man United . Boyhood club: Van Gaal supported Spurs as a child because of an admiration for striker Jimmy Greaves . Speaking for the first time about turning down the job now occupied by Mauricio Pochettino, Van Gaal said: ‘It was very close. Very close. As a little boy I was a fan of Tottenham Hotspur with the team of Jimmy Greaves when he was the champion. Jimmy Greaves was my idol. They had fantastic white shirts. So I was very close.’ Van Gaal was at the Dutch team’s hotel in Santpoort-Noord, on the outskirts of Amsterdam, ahead of a friendly with Wales on Wednesday night that was expected to provide a robust test for Holand before they fly out to Brazil on Thursday. But the withdrawal of both Gareth Bale through injury and the absence of Aaron Ramsey for recuperation has left Van Gaal feeling ‘disappointed’. He questioned whether the players’ omission could be described as ‘holidays’. ‘I have said to my board that they have to insist on playing against Bale and Ramsey,’ said Van Gaal of the fixture scheduling. ‘But this can happen in football. I don't know why, whether it is injury or holidays. ‘When it is a holiday I am a little bit disappointed. But I can understand it because Bale has had a difficult but also impressive season under his belt. ‘It is better that we have the best team of Wales because we need resistance. I think Wales without these players are weaker.’ Sidelined: Van Gaal is disappointed Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey will miss Wales' friendly with Holland . Van Gaal will not utter a word directly about United until after the World Cup – ‘I have said to the CEO of Manchester United Ed Woodward that I only speak about the Dutch national team’ – but he did open up about his management style and said it was important his team liked him. He has been painted as a unshakeable authoritarian since his appointment but showed a personable side on Monday when asked if it mattered what players thought. ‘I think it is very important,’ he said. ‘I am a coach who wants a good relationship with my players and I do everything to reach that level. But he added: ‘Sometimes it is not reachable as the players are not open-minded and don’t adapt to the norms that I put in the team.  When you are not listening, always out, or I go out.’","Van Gaal reveals he was 'very close' to taking over at Tottenham before agreeing to become the new Manchester United boss .

"Let me tell you two things you didn’t know about Joey Barton. Firstly, I was the person who engineered his meeting with Morrissey at Glastonbury three years ago. I . was working in my office at home when my phone rang. It was Barton’s . agent. He had heard I knew the right people to fix up a meeting for his . player and Morrissey, one of the greatest poets, lyricists and singers . ever, and he politely asked if I could help out. Reformed character: Joey Barton appears to be at home with Queens Park Rangers after some difficulties . Management material? Harry Redknapp said he can see Barton becoming a boss when he retires . Two fingers up: This is what Barton would look like if he assumed a managerial role in the future . Joey had . been aggressive and abusive towards me on social media but I have . standards and I don’t hold grudges, so I was happy to oblige. So . I made the necessary call and a few weeks later I smiled as I read in . MailOnline about Joey Barton’s meeting with Moz at Glastonbury. Secondly, . he has been doing his coaching badges and a good friend of mine (a . journalist, not an ex-professional footballer), was on the same course . as Barton. Some of the other former players on the same course wanted to . ‘get’ the journalist. This may have meant injuring him on the pitch, or . bullying him off it; or merely playing some footballer-style pranks on . him, possibly urinating in his shoes or setting fire to his clothes - . the sort of high-brow jinks players get excited about. We . will never know what might’ve happened, however, because Barton took it . upon himself to look after my pal, and they struck up a friendship. They're up! QPR clinched promotion to the Premier League by beating Derby County on Saturday . I . won’t pretend I know Barton personally – we are from similar . backgrounds but that’s probably where the similarities end. To be honest . I’m not really interested in what he’s like off the field, I talk and . write about football and that’s where I want to focus when talking about . him. Getting bogged down in some of the huge problems of his past isn’t a fair way to judge him as a professional footballer now. I do think it is time to re-evaluate Barton on the pitch though. Two . years ago he let QPR down badly when he was sent off for fighting at . Manchester City. But this season he has made up for that. His . leadership has been brilliant and his tactical discipline has been . seriously impressive. Both of those qualities were evident on Saturday . at Wembley as QPR beat Derby to win promotion back to the Premier . League. A . source close to Harry Redknapp told me on Saturday that he has ‘grown . to like Barton’ as the season has gone on. In the post-match frenzy at . Wembley, Redknapp declared that Barton will make a great manager in the . future. Last . year the midfielder was adamant he wouldn’t play in the Championship, but he’s . knuckled down and been one of the leaders for QPR this season. I . was at the game at Wembley with Stuart Pearce, who worked with Barton at . Manchester City. Pearce told me: ‘Joey is reasonably likeable. I don’t . think he’s been blessed with a great deal of talent and if you’d told me . back then when he was in Man City’s reserves he would have a career in . professional football at this level I would have said, “Not a chance in . hell.” 'He’s got where he’s got in the professional game purely through . doggedness and hard work and wanting to be out on the training pitch. I . probably see a little bit of me in him in regards to that.’ That’s high praise from Pearce, who played in a World Cup semi final and a European Championship semi-final. At QPR Barton is doing what he did at Newcastle: looking at home towards the top of the Championship. Off the field Barton is at times smart, . at other times ridiculous and that’s why I’d rather judge him on his . football, although in the past some of the things he has done away from . the game have been impossible to ignore. Fighter: Barton has looked at home at the top of the Championship throughout this season . I . suspect his appearance on Question Time this week will see him try to . win applause from the audience with carefully thought out words about . UKIP, criticism of politicians (always a winner from the non-politicians . on the QT panel) and a blast at the FA when he’s asked about England’s . chances at the World Cup. Throw . in a few big words, present the family man image, mention that he’s . doing a degree and maybe a quote from Nietzsche and he’ll become the . poster boy for reformed violent criminals, and that’s not a bad thing. He’s . gone from being a thug, to being aggressive on social media, to seeking . to expand his mind. He’s heading in a positive direction. If he . survives Piers Morgan on TV on Thursday night, Barton’s off-the-field . reinvention will, in the eyes of the public, probably be complete. If he continues to be QPR’s heartbeat in the Premier League, his reinvention on the field will also be complete.","Barton was integral to Queens Park Rangers' promotion .

"Life: Mumia Abu-Jamal is serving a life sentence for the murder of officer Daniel Faulkner . A convicted cop killer has sparked outrage after giving a speech to a graduating class in which he urged students to strive to make the world 'better. Mumia Abu-Jamal spoke by video to 20 students receiving bachelor degrees from Goddard College in Plainfield. In 1981 he was found guilty of killing Daniel Faulkner by shooting him dead in Center City, Philadelphia. In his speech from prison today Abu-Jamal credited Goddard with his reigning love for education - Abu-Jamal received a degree from the accredited, private liberal arts college in 1996 while in prison. 'Goddard reawakened in me my love of learning,' he said. 'In my mind, I left death row.' 'Think about the myriad of problems that beset this land and strive to make it better,' Abu-Jamal said in the audio message, reports 6ABC. Philadelphia police held a silent vigil Sunday in protest of a Vermont college's selection. Members of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 5 and community members gathered in Center City in memory of Faulkner who was murdered at that exact intersection nearly 33 years ago. The Fraternal Order and a state law maker who organized the silent protest are among those who want convicted cop-killers like Abu-Jamal stripped of their right to freedom of speech, My Fox Philly reports. The Goddard speech is not Abu-Jamal's first commencement address. In 1999, Abu-Jamal gave the commencement address to graduates of Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash,. and in 2000 he was the commencement speaker at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Silence: Philadelphia police and community members held a 30 minute silence honoring officer Daniel Faulkner who was gunned down 32 years ago . Family: Faulkner's wife recently spoke out in outrage of the Goddard College student's selection of Abu-Jamal as their commencement speaker . Both of those speeches caused protests and sparked outrage from Faulkner's family and police officers, Philly.com reports. Abu-Jamal was convicted and sentenced to death after the December 9, 1981 murder of Faulkner. He was resentenced to life in 2012. However, the case has been riddled with appeals for more than two decades, Philly.com reports. Abu-Jamal supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. The case was a famous one and has resulted in Abu-Jamal's long-standing fame. Fame: Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show, and even has a street named after him in France . Speech: Abu-Jamal has given three commencement speeches in total since his incarceration . Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show and even has a street named after him in France. However, the city of Philadelphia has not fall victim to the Hollywood picture of Abu-Jamal, Philly.com reports. Michael Smerconish, a Philadelphia Inquirer Columnist, reported that Abu-Jamal has failed to cultivate support in the city of brotherly love. 'People at home know what happened and don't buy into the Hollywood lore,' Smerconish wrote. Goddard College reportedly holds 20 commencement ceremonies annually so graduates in each degree program will receive a personalized experience, according to a Goddard official. The graduates selected Abu-Jamal to give their commencement speech and the school has received some backlash since the decision. Infamous: Abu-Jamal is held by many as a revolutionary, however, he has failed to cultivate support in Philadelphia . The College released the following message about the student's selection: . 'Many diverse commencement speakers have been chosen to represent perspectives not normally in our discourse. 'Even if it is unpopular, we need to listen to and engage in difficult discussions. This is what free speech is all about. Our students understand there is great merit in what Mumia Abu-Jamal has to say. 'It is important that we at Goddard College support this complicated inquiry and the freedom of speech.'

"Three hospitals just outside Cincinnati received an influx of ten suspected heroin overdose victims in just 48 hours last week. Facilities in Fort Thomas, Florence and Covington treated the men and women aged 23 to 50 all with the lifesaving drug Narcan. Two victims, men aged 26 and 31, died from their overdoses, which officials say could have actually been caused by the opiate fentanyl--not heroin. A quick response and a dose of naloxone, an opiate-reversing drug, bring most patients back. Some are put on ventilators. A few never revive. Overdose: Three hospitals just outside Cincinnati received an influx of ten suspected heroin overdose victims in just 48 hours last week. Two of the ODs resulted in death, both were men and both occurred at St. Elizabeth Healthcare in Ft. Thomas, Kentucky . Fentanyl and heroin seizures are on the rise in the area. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with a powder to make it look more like heroin. Fentanyl, an even more potent opiate, is especially dangerous when users believe it to be heroin. It was unclear as of Thursday which drug was to blame for the overdoses, according to Ashel Kruetzkamp, nurse manager at St. Elizabeth Fort Thomas, where both fatalities occurred. 'Our staff is getting alarmed about the rates of these overdoses that we're seeing,' Kruetzkamp told Cincinnati.com. In 2007, there were an estimated 373,000 heroin users in the U.S. By 2012, the number was 669,000, with the greatest increases among those 18 to 25. First-time users nearly doubled in a six-year period ending in 2012, from 90,000 to 156,000. Experts note that many users turned to heroin after a crackdown on prescription drug 'pill mills' made painkillers such as OxyContin harder to find and more costly. It's killing because it can be extremely pure or laced with other powerful narcotics. That, coupled with a low tolerance once people start using again after treatment, is catching addicts off guard. In hard-hit places, police, doctors, parents and former users are struggling to find solutions and save lives. The problem is especially severe in Ohio and southern Ohio more specifically. Heroin-related deaths have more than tripled in Butler County, just north of the city. There were 55 deaths last year, and within one two-week period, the city's emergency paramedic units responded to 18 heroin overdoses. Growing problem: Heroin is taking more and more lives across America and Ohio--specifically southern Ohio along with northern Kentucky--is espcially bad off .","Between Friday to Sunday in Northern Kentucky outside Cincinnati, three hospitals treated the ten suspected heroin ODs .

"The father of California teenager Connor Ekchadrt posted online a heartbreaking video recorded at his son’s graveside warning other parents and children about the dangers of synthetic drugs that claimed his son’s life this summer. Eckhardt, 19, was declared brain-dead in July after taking one hit of synthetic marijuana commonly known as ‘Spice’ and falling into a coma. Since Connor’s passing, his parents, Devin and Veronica Eckhardt, have been raising awareness of the dangers of synthetic drugs, which are readily available for purchase in bodegas and smoke shops. Scroll down for video . Father's grief: Devin Eckhardt is seen here in July embracing his brain-dead son, 19-year-old Connor, after he fell into a coma as a result of smoking synthetic marijuana . Powerful message: Mr Eckhardt (left) has recorded a chilling video from his son's graveside (right) urging other parents to learn from their mistakes and talk to their children about drugs like Spice . On Monday, Devin Eckhardt uploaded a video on his late son’s Facebook page showing him at his son’s graveside to send a strong message to other parents and children about Spice and similar narcotics. ‘I'm standing here at your graveside, Connor, and I can't believe this is true,’ Mr Eckhardt says, addressing his deceased child. ‘I look at this stone and I see you name on it, and I just think, ‘This can't be where things are, this can't be my life… and at any minute you're gonna call, or you're gonna come bounding up on you skateboard with that chuckle in your laugh and that this nightmare will end. ‘And I know you’re not here, I know you’re with Jesus, and I think that's the only reason we can go on and yet... I got a massive hole in my heart ‘cause I miss you so much.’ According to the grieving father, Connor was under ‘tremendous’ peer pressure the night of July 12 when he made the fateful decision to smoke synthetic marijuana. ‘But one hit of Spice and it changed everything, not just for you but for us, for you mom and your sisters. It's the worst nightmare ever. Too young: Connor, pictured in the hospital with his mother, left, passed away in July . Crusader: Mr Eckhardt stressed that drugs like Spice are very dangerous and said that families need to take a stand against them . The family have been raising awareness of the risks of synthetic drugs over the past three months . I don't have my son to surf with, or ride motocross, or to do all the fun things we loved doing,’ Eckhardt says in the heart-rending video looking at a stone slab engraved with his son’s name. ‘Sometimes I'm not sure how we're supposed to go on, or what I'm supposed to do.’ The father concludes his homemade PSA, which as of Monday night has been shared nearly 290 times, by expressing hope that parents familiar with their story will take it to heart and ‘do things differently.’ ‘If you think Spice and synthetics are some ‘OK’ kind of drug, somehow this won't happen to you… don't fool yourself. ‘We have to take a stand, we gotta change things. This shouldn't be,’ he says. ‘Our lives are forever changed. Don't let what happened to us happen to you.’ The Eckhardts have launched a worldwide campaign against synthetic drugs through Connor's Facebook page and through a site called Do It 4 Connor, raising awareness that substances like Spice and K2 can not only kill, but can also cause heart attacks and brain damage. 'We thought we were in touch,' Devin and Veronica Eckhardt told Fox11. 'We thought we were the cool parents. We knew what was going on.' Heartbroken family: The Eckhardts standing around the hospital bed where brain-dead Connor Eckhardt lay before his organs were donated . Happier times: Veronica, Connor, Ashnika, Devin and Sabrina Eckhardt before Connor's life was cut short after taking one hit of synthetic marijuana . 'He gave into (peer pressure) — thinking that it was okay, it was somehow safe — and one hit later, he goes to sleep and never wakes up,' Mr Eckhardt told KTLA in August. Also known as K2, spice is a mixture of herbs that's sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to marijuana. The herbs and chemicals in spice vary, making it impossible for users to know what they're smoking and in what concentrations. 'These substances are not benign,' Dr Andrew Monte, the lead author of an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, told the station. 'People may not realize how dangerous these drugs can be – up to 1,000 times stronger binding to cannabis receptors when compared to traditional marijuana.' Incredibly, it's readily available in shops and online, even though the sale of it is illegal in California. Bereft: Connor's mother hugs the lifeless body of her only son . Precious moments: The Eckhardts spent four days with their son before he was taken in to surgery to remove his organs for donation . Synthetic marijuana has been labeled incense, potpourri and herbal smoking blend — and it's been sold using names such as K2 and Spice. Connor Eckhardt fell asleep after taking a single hit of spice. His brain, deprived of oxygen, began to swell and he slipped into a coma. Doctors were unable to detect Spice in Connor's system because there's no way to trace its ever-changing components, but the package of the drug was still in his pocket, and no other drugs were found in his system. Sabrina Eckhardt is just a year and a half younger than her brother and she, like the other two Eckhardt children, was adopted. California boy: Connor loved surfing, skateboarding, snowboarding and motocross . Close: The teenager was devoted to his two sisters, Sabrina (center), 17, and five-year-old Ashnika . Meaning from loss: The family is determined that Connor's death will not be in vain and are spreading his story to warn others . She and Connor were extremely close and she has struggled to come to terms with her brother's loss. The Eckhardts used their last precious minutes with Connor, a California boy whose bronzed skin was a testament to his love of surfing and skateboarding, to do something incredibly brave. They filmed a short video by Connor's bedside in July about the dangers of synthetic marijuana. 'This is our son, Connor Reid Eckhardt,' Veronica said, her voice raw with emotion. 'He made the deadly choice to use a product called K2, or spice, and Connor is completely brain-dead... This is not a game, it is totally real, please help us fight his fight.'","Connor Eckhardt, 19, slipped into a coma in July after taking one hit of synthetic marijuana .

"This double-storey residence may look like many other on the market- but number 11 Downs St comes with a coloured history not many houses in Australia can lay claim to. The Brunswick house in Victoria is the former family home of convicted crime boss Tony Mokbel- and not only does it come with four bedrooms and generous living areas, it also comes with a certain notoriety. Arguably one of the most infamous men in Australia's gangland wars, Mokbel was extradited from Athens, Greece after fleeing the country in 2006. In 2012 he was sentenced to 30 years in jail by the Supreme Court of Victoria, where he will remain behind bars for a minimum of 22 years, closing one chapter of the Melbourne gangland wars. Scroll down for video . Tony Mokbel's former family home is on the market, asking $1.23 million for the four-bedroom property . The property has been listed by Glenn Barlett of Woodards, with inspection dates organised for Saturday October 18, as well as the following weekend. The house has been in and out of the news over the past ten years, with it's former next door neighbour, number 9 Downs Street, also owned by Mokbel, which was once home to an amphetamine laboratory . Mokbel was on trial for importing cocaine, and hid in his home state for eight months before relocating to Western Australian and travelling to Greece, his country of heritage, in a yacht. The property was used as surety to gain the  criminal bail in 2006 by his sister-in-law Renate, who later served jail time after she was banned from selling the property by the courts. Mokbel was been charged with the murder of drug syndicate patriarch Lewis Moran, for which he was acquitted in 2009, and is alleged to have laundered over $2 million through a Melbourne brothel. Australian authorities also allege that Mokbel was the mastermind behind the Melbourne amphetamines trade, as well as multiple links to the deaths of several victims in the city's gangland war. The house has been in and out of the news over the past ten years, with it's former next door neighbour, number 9 Downs Street, also owned by Mokbel, which was once home to an amphetamine laboratory, reported The Age. After the lab was discovered by police in 1997, the house was blown up in an accident, and was then transformed into an extension of number 11, including a swimming pool, garden area, and side-yard for the already large property. Ownership of the house was transferred to the Attorney-General of Victoria in 2009, the government was legally allowed to sell the property. The residence has been empty for over four years, and is now asking $1.23 million, a rise of $100,000 over the last listed price.

Rail companies used the promotional material to lure tourists with promises of family-friendly beaches, stunning sights or romantic locations for couples at a time when very few people were flying commercially. Blast from the past: Italian artist Fortunino Matania's 1926 poster showing adults relaxing near the seaside in Blackpool is worth an estimated £3,000 to £4,600 .

Those were the days: A young couple sitting on a promenade wall enjoys a cigarette in this ad for Bridlington . Nicholas Lowry, president of Swann Galleries, said: ‘These posters were designed in the 1920s and 1930s for the large railway companies that operated around the United Kingdom with the intention of filling seats on their trains. ‘They also wanted to beautify ticket offices and train platforms where most of these posters were intended to be displayed. ‘The posters bear striking, colourful and eye catching images from destinations which the different rail companies serviced. Some show lifestyle images giving visual snapshots of the way of life of the elegant people who vacation in those spots.’ Time to relax: This ad for the famous Yorkshire resort of Scarborough features a demure couple picnicking on a hill overlooking the town's golden beach .

"An Esa satellite has found an unusual consequence of the melting of ice in Antarctica. While rising sea levels and changing global temperatures are already known to be a consequence of alleged manmade climate change, the GOCE satellite - which was not intended to study the effects of a warming climate - has found that gravity is weakening where ice is melting the fastest. The results show that the thinning ice sheet from November 2009 to June 2012 caused local variations in gravity, measured by the satellite. Scroll down for video . Researchers from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and elsewhere have found that gravity is weakening at Earth's poles. In this graphic a combination of data from Esa's GOCE mission and Nasa's Grace satellites shows the ‘vertical gravity gradient change’. Blue is the biggest change, red the least . The GOCE satellite burned up in Earth’s atmosphere as planned in November 2013 after four years in orbit. During its mission it measured Earth’s gravity in unprecedented detail, detailing where it was weakest and strongest on the surface. But recently, the high-resolution measurements from GOCE over Antarctica between November 2009 and June 2012 were analysed by scientists from the German Geodetic Research Institute, Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and the Technical University of Munich in Germany. Full name: Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer . Mission length: 17 March 2009 - Nov 2013 . Number of instruments: Three . Mission cost: £295 million ($480 million) Orbit: About 160 miles (260km) altitude, polar, aun-synchronous . Mass: 2,425lbs (1,100kg) Size: 17.4ft (5.3 metres long, about 3.3ft (one metre) body diameter . Scientists found that the decrease in the mass of ice during this period was mirrored in GOCE’s measurements of gravity, even though the mission was not designed to detect changes over time. The findings were made by combining GOCE’s high-resolution measurements with information from the Nasa-German Grace satellite, designed to measure change in ice mass. The fluctuations observed are minute, however, and not enough for a living organism to sense. The measurements from GOCE correlate with the Grace satellite and show how much ice is being lost each year. While exact figures of the shift in gravity are miniscule, the results show how some parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet are losing up to 67 gigatones of ice per year. This is contributing to a 0.51 mm per year sea level rise in the Amundsen Sea Sector. And they  found that that the loss of ice from West Antarctica between 2009 and 2012 caused the dip in the gravity field over the region. In addition, GOCE data could be used to help validate satellite altimetry measurements for an even clearer understanding of ice-sheet and sea-level change in the future. The changes in gravity intensity were found to be occurring where ice is melting fastest in West Antarctica due to manmade global warming. The discovery was made by the GOCE satellite, which was not originally intended to study climate change . The high-resolution measurements from the satellite are further evidence of how manmade climate change will affect the planet in unknown ways. The Goce satellite (illustration shown) burned up in Earth’s atmosphere as planned in November 2013 after four years in orbit . Esa's CryoSat satellite, which carries a radar altimeter, has recently shown that since 2009 the rate at which ice is been lost from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet every year has increased by a factor of three. And, between 2011 and 2014, Antarctica as a whole has been shrinking in volume by 30 cubic miles (125 cubic kilometres) a year. 'We are now working in an interdisciplinary team to extend the analysis of GOCE’s data to all of Antarctica,' said Dr Johannes Bouman from the German Geodetic Research Institute. 'This will help us gain further comparison with results from CryoSat for an even more reliable picture of actual changes in ice mass.' During its mission, GOCE produced a unique model of the geoid, which is essentially a virtual surface of Earth where water does not flow from one point to another. The colours in the image represent deviations in height from an ideal geoid. The blue shades represent low values and the reds/yellows represent high values .","Researchers from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and Esa have found that gravity is weakening at Earth's poles .

"You may soon be able to use your iPad in direct sunlight if Apple goes ahead with rumoured plans for an anti-glare screen. Reports claim Apple suppliers have begun manufacturing the new range of iPads ahead of an October launch. And sources believe the devices will have anti-reflective laminated displays to make it easier to use in bright light, and outside - compared to current, reflective models. Reports claim Apple's suppliers have begun manufacturing the new range of iPads, and they may feature anti-glare displays. This would make the devices easier to use outside. The refreshed tablet range is expected to launch in October. Last year's iPad Air (left) and iPad mini with Retina display (right) are pictured . By comparison, the Kindle Fire HD tablet already has a polarising filter and uses anti-glare technology. According to Bloomberg, two unnamed people familiar with plans said mass production of the 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 has started, and a refreshed 7.9-inch iPad mini will be manufactured soon. Apple is hoping to boost iPad sales with its new range, after they slumped 9 per cent in the last quarter. The iPhone maker reported sales of $37.4 billion (£21.9 billion) in its third quarter ending June, falling short of expectations for about $38 billion (£22.3 billion). The Cupertino-based company also revealed that only 13.2 million iPads were sold in the last quarter, compared to 16.3 million in the previous quarter. The results have triggered fears that iPad sales are set to get worse once Apple launches its rumoured, large-screen iPhone this autumn. Last year, Apple launched its iPhone 5S and 5C at a September event, followed by new iPads in October.

"Australian prison authorities have reportedly moved convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika to a different Victorian prison, fearing he has been promoting extremism from jail. Benbrika, also known as Sheik Abu Bakr, is serving a 15 year jail term after being convicted in 2009 for his role leading a terrorist group that planned to attack Melbourne's Crown casino and bomb the MCG. He was previously held in the high-security unit of Barwon Prison. Authorities believe Benbrika has been communicating with jihadist recruits from behind bars after a number of his followers travelled to Syria to join the extremist Islamic State group after visiting him in prison,News Corp Australia reports. It's reported Benbrika sees himself as a spiritual leader of new Australian extremists, similar to jailed Indonesian cleric Abu Baku Bashir, the 'spiritual leader' of the Bali bombers. Scroll down for video . Convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika is believed by authorities to have been influencing jihadist recruits from prison . In 2009, Benbrika was the first person in Australia to be convicted of leading a terrorist organisation. He planned to attack Melbourne's Crown casino and bomb the MCG . Algerian-born Benbrika has been described as a self-proclaimed Islamic cleric and was previously President of the Algerian Society, which focused on assisting Algerian refugees. He was one of 17 men arrested in Sydney and Melbourne in 2005 in one of Australia's largest counter terrorism operations, Operation Pendennis, and was the first person in Australia to be convicted of leading a terrorist organisation. Prosecutors alleged the group was committed to violent ‘jihad’ against those they perceived to be the enemies of Islam. During his trial, the Victorian Supreme Court heard how Benbrika instructed his followers in how to kill a person with a knife. 'You put your hand here, like this. And you put ... a knife here, and you open. This is training. You have to learn it,' were his words to three of his followers, caught by a secret police bug in the lead up to his arrest. He added that the victim will groan 'and then you strike.' According to News Corp, authorities are reviewing Benbrika's prison entitlements, including his access to computers and books, and the number of visitors he can receive. It is believed about 60 Australians are fighting in Iraq and Syria with groups such as Islamic State. Last month, Australian Police conducted dawn counter terrorism raids across Sydney and Brisbane after receiving intelligence that Islamic State supporters were planning a public execution on Australian streets. At least 800 officers from AFP and NSW Police were involved in the anti-terror raids in Sydney and Brisbane in September and 15 people were arrested. Last month, fifteen people were arrested when police swooped on homes across Western Sydney and South Brisbane in the largest counter terrorism raids in Australia's history. The raids were sparked by intelligence that Islamic State supporters were planning a public execution in Australian streets. 'Police believe that this group that we have executed this operation on today had the intention, and had started to carry out planning, to commit violent acts here in Australia,' AFP Acting Commissioner Andrew Colvin told reporters in Sydney at the time. 'Those violent acts particularly related to random acts against members of the public,' he said. The plot involved abducting a member of the public in Sydney and beheading them. One of the men arrested, Omarjan Azari, was found in Court to have conspired with a different Islamist militant, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, to carry out an attack which was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community.' Baryalei, who had previously worked as a bouncer in Sydney’s Kings Cross nightclub district and  played a role in the Australian TV series Underbelly, is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East.","Abdul Nacer Benbrika has been moved to a different Victorian prison over fears he has been promoting extremism from jail .

"Azelle Rodney, 24, died in 2005 after being shot. Ex-specialist firearms officer Anthony Long has today been named as the man charged with his murder . The police marksman charged with the murder of robbery suspect Azelle Rodney has been named for the first time today. Anthony Long, who until now has been known only as E7, is an ex-specialist firearms officer with the Metropolitan Police CO19 section. He is facing a murder charge in relation to the fatal shooting of Mr Rodney, 24, in Edgware, northwest London, on the night of 30 April 2005. Long, whose address was given as the Police Federation Headquarters in Leatherhead, Surrey, can be named after reporting restrictions were lifted at the Old Bailey. He is due to go on trial on June 8 next year, with the case expected to last around a month. Long, who did not attend today’s hearing before Mr Justice Sweeney, is accused of killing Mr Rodney. Mr Rodney died after officers stopped the car he was travelling in with two other men, fearing that they were armed and on their way to rob Colombian drug dealers. He was hit six times, once each in the arm and back, and fatally four times in the head. The Crown Prosecution Service announced it planned to charge the officer with murder in July, after reviewing new evidence following the outcome of a public inquiry into Mr Rodney’s death. Sir Christopher Holland, who chaired an inquiry into Mr Rodney’s death last year, ruled that there was ‘no justification’ for the shooting by Long. Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham - Mr Rodney’s fellow passengers in the VW Golf - were both handed custodial sentences for drugs and firearms offences in January 2006. Lovell was also convicted of allowing drug production in his Hammersmith home. He was jailed for seven years, while Graham was handed a six year sentence. Susan Alexander, Mr Rodney’s mother (pictured last year), has campaigned vigorously for an apology from the Met for the ‘execution’ of her son. In July, she said she was 'very pleased' the officer had been charged . The shooting took place outside The Railway Tavern on Hale Lane in Edgware, north London in April 2005 . Mr Rodney, of west London, had two brothers and a girlfriend who gave birth to his daughter after he was fatally shot. Susan Alexander, Mr Rodney’s mother, has campaigned vigorously for an apology from the Met for the ‘execution’ of her son. After Long was charged in July, she said: ‘I am very pleased at the decision to prosecute the officer who killed my son. I have waited a long time to see this day and hope this prosecution will lead to justice for Azelle.’ Long has not yet entered a plea to the charge of murder.

"Almost one in seven Australians are living below the poverty line and now the Australian Council of Social Service fear that federal budget measures will make it worse. ACOSS has released a report revealing poverty is growing in Australia, with an estimated 2.5 million people, or 13.9 per cent, living below the internationally accepted poverty line. It also found 603,000, or 17.7 per cent, of all children are living in poverty. Almost one in seven Australians are living below the poverty line . The social problem is particularly stark in NSW, which has the highest proportion of people facing hardship with some 868,373 people living below the poverty line. 'This is alarming and highlights the need for a national plan to tackle the scourge of poverty which diminishes us all in one of the wealthiest countries in the world,' ACOSS CEO Cassandra Goldie said on Sunday. 'This finding brings into focus the sheer inadequacy of these allowance payments, which fall well below the poverty line.' Dr Goldie said there were two critical ways government policy could alleviate poverty: housing and basic income support. 'Thirty-six dollars a day is not enough security - there is a real risk of poverty while struggling on the Newstart allowance,' Dr Goldie said. The poverty line for a single adult is $400 per week yet the maximum rate of payment for a single person on Newstart is $501 a fortnight. The report found those most likely to be living in poverty are people who are unemployed . ACOSS has released a report revealing poverty is growing in Australia, with an estimated 2.5 million people, or 13.9 per cent, living below the internationally accepted poverty line . When Rent Assistance and other supplementary payments are added, it's only $303 per week. That's $97 per week below the median income poverty line. The report found those most likely to be living in poverty are people who are unemployed (61.2 per cent) and those in households that rely on social security as the main source of income (40.1 per cent), particularly on Newstart. Dr Goldie said the report emphasised dangers in the federal budget, including plans to reduce indexation of pension payments. '(This) is likely to result in higher poverty rates over time,' she said. 'These overall findings are a wake-up call for us as a community and shine a spotlight on the current policy direction of the federal government. 'It provides an opportunity for the government to work with the whole community to reconfigure its first budget and national policy priorities around the urgent need to address poverty in Australia.' Meanwhile, the Governor-General Peter Cosgrove has called on his fellow country men and women to help Australians plagued by the ""insidious and all encompassing"" problem of poverty. Sir Peter said the problem of poverty did not discriminate. He told the launch of Anti-Poverty Week in Sydney poverty was insidious and all encompassing because it deprived people of a choice. 'It deprives them of their freedom and assaults their dignity. As a nation we can't allow it to continue,' he said on Sunday. The Australian Council of Social Service fear that federal budget measures will make it worse . The risk of poverty is greater outside capital cities in most states and territories (especially in Queensland and Tasmania), in part due to higher unemployment in regional Australia, the report says. The exceptions are NSW and Western Australia, where very high housing costs in the capital cities have increased the risk of poverty. Anti-Poverty Week chair Julian Disney said there was many areas of disadvantage, not just lack of income, including disability and mental health. He stressed the need to provide some vulnerable people with deep, life-long support. 'We ...shouldn't fool ourselves that just giving them some money and education and patting them on the back will be sufficient,' he said. 'Many of the disadvantages are much deeper than that."" Salvation Army Moneycare financial counsellor Lisa Ross said it doesn't take much for someone to suddenly find themselves below the poverty line. 'All within a month, people can (suddenly) face poverty,' Ms Ross said.","Australian Council of Social Service reveals Australia's poverty is growing .

"Buying a property can be an overwhelming project, as any new-home owner will tell you. The investment will probably be the biggest financial output you will undertake, and will take a lot of hard work and research to ensure you are on the right track. Knowing the do's and don't's is crucial, especially as Australia's record-making house prices are steadily increasing and safe within a property bubble that doesn't look to burst. Daily Mail Australia spoke to the country's leading experts to get the best advice for prospective property buyers, ahead of a weekend brimming with auctions in the capital cities. Scroll down for video . Up for sale this weekend: 1 Russel St, Clontarf, on Sydney's North Shore is valued at over $6 million and has Harbour views amongst a flurry of other features. This exquisite three level house has five bedrooms and four bathrooms and is flooded with natural light . The property has panoramic views of Sydney Harbour, and with a built in pool, this is high living at it's best . Know your figures. Setting yourself a strict budget, and being disciplined with sticking to it, is the most crucial tip for prospective buyers. Louis Christopher, Managing Director of SQM Research, told Daily Mail Australia, 'Things get very emotional. When people are desperate to buy a house, they can often exceed the budget they set for themselves, which may seem exciting at the time but will only hurt them in the long run.' Knowing your figures also means investigating the market. Spend time looking at what houses in the area have sold for, whether this is through a price guide or by calling agents. 1. Know your figures. Setting yourself a strict budget, and being disciplined with sticking to it, is the most crucial tip for prospective buyers. 2. Get your finances sorted out before you head to an auction. 3. Shop around for the most competitive mortgage. 4. Get the property inspected. 5. Know your buying tactics. Peter Kelahar, Director of PK Property, said that this step is crucial in knowing how and even if you should spend your money so that you don't fork out extra hard earned cash unnecessarily. 'Work out a realistic price range,' Kelahar said, 'Take into extra consideration where you live. Don't be afraid to investigate.' Get your finances sorted out before you head to an auction. In the competitive housing market, it's all about being able to move as quickly as possible, but you also need to make sure you have the most competitive mortgage available to you. 'Get your finances approved unconditionally, so if you need to move you  can do it then and there with nothing holding you back,' said Kelahar. 'You may need to move like lightning, so that you have something to offer over other buyers that might not be as prepared.' Another multi-million dollar property is this house, nestled in South Yarra in Victoria. It goes under the hammer  at auction on Saturday . This exquisite residence originally designed by Marcus Martin has recently undergone a masterful renovation and extension . The property boasts five bedrooms, each with a private bathroom, a cellar, and private north facing garden and pool . Shop around for the most competitive mortgage. Louis Christopher of SQM Research encourages prospective buyers to shop around for the best mortgage rate possible. 'Banks are being quite competitive with the products they offer,' he said, 'So take full advantage by asking lots of questions.' Get the property inspected. This is non-negotiable. All properties have quirks, no matter how good they might look in photos, and it is important that before you commit to buying that you have all the facts available to you. Christopher recommends being creative and specific, tailoring property inspections to your concerns. 'Get a plumber to come in and look at the plumbing. Get a pest controller to check the house out for white ants. Some of the standard inspections wont pick up the issues that really make a difference,' he said. Know your buying tactics. If you are buying a house with a partner, be clear and specific about how and when you want to bid. Do some research and visit other auctions in the area, and see how they work. If you have your heart set on a property, make sure you've been to a few auctions before so you don't make a rookie mistake and set yourself back. 'Bidding comes down to evaluation,' said Christopher. With a busy weekend for property auctions, it is important to keep in mind that there will be limited stock from now until the end of the October long weekend. This is driving the price up and property stock is tight, and the demand will just push house valuations up even further. Kelahar advises that many agents will start their campaigns after the October long weekend. 'They're ready to flick the switch,' he said, 'They have all the photos taken and are just waiting for the right time.' 'At the moment it's a bit of a Mexican standoff, where people don't want to put their property up if they can't find somewhere to live. It'll loosen eventually, but just be aware of the trends.'","All the tips and tricks you need to make sure you're playing the game the right way .

"Police were sent on a wild goose chase around the streets of Sheffield in a bid to capture a giant emu which was spotted marauding through the city's streets. Eddie the bird was seen brazenly wandering around a residential area after escaping from a nearby farm, just before the early-morning commuter rush. Officers managed to contain the inquisitive bird in a garden and began contacting nearby farms and animal attractions to try and track down the emu's owner. Eddie the bird was seen brazenly wandering around a residential area after escaping from a nearby farm, just before the early-morning commuter rush . They then tried contacting local smallholdings and eventually found the emu's home. The couple looking after the bird - who live on a 30-acre farm - had only recently started caring for the emu after a friend was no longer able to look after the pet. Dawn Critchlow, 46, said: 'He'd only been with us a day when he took off. He didn't get very far. 'I'm looking after him for a friend who is not very well. We found him in someone's garden eating carrots.' Dawn said 18-month-old Eddie's owner also had geese, chickens and a skunk. She added: 'He is back with us now - and he's locked up.' Officers managed to contain the inquisitive bird in a garden and began contacting nearby farms and animal attractions to try and track down the emu's owner . Inspector Jason Booth, from South Yorkshire Police, said: 'You couldn't make it up. Who would have thought we would have been dealing with a mystery emu when we turned up? 'We started ringing local farms and people with smallholdings in the area and eventually found the owner. 'They had only recently taken possession of it from a friend who could no longer look after it. 'It was quite early when it was reported to us so I don't think they had realised it was missing but they came with a horse box and took it back. 'It certainly demonstrates the variety of police work and we are just pleased that there was a happy ending. 'The emu was kept safe, it didn't get loose on to the roads and it has been reunited with its owner.'","Eddie the bird was spotted by concerned residents in Sheffield, South Yorks .

"Workers cleaning out the home of an elderly woman in Alaska who died found a secret treasure trove of memorabilia from the Nuremberg war tribunal. The documents and photographs were contained in a locked trunk in the home of Maxine Carr, who moved to Anchorage after the war. When workers from the Alaska Auction Company went through the trunk looking for valuables, they discovered carbon copies of transcripts from the war trial tribunal. Maxine Carr worked as a stenographer at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal for 32 months . Her amazing story came to light after auctioneers discovered a trunk packed with memorabilia at her home . Mrs Carr kept documentation from the tribunal including letters from senior Nazis on a range of matters . They also found identification cards belonging to Mrs Carr proving that she had worked at the historic trial. They also found a staff directory for the multinational tribunal that prosecuted scores of Nazi masterminds in those infamous trials, a translated letter to Nazi faithful that signs off with 'Heil Hitler' and personal credentials and correspondence belonging to a lowly postwar stenographer who squirreled the mementos away for decades. Christine Hill, who owns the auction house with her husband Duane said: 'It was chilling, very chilling going through that paperwork. Very unsettling.' The Carr collection is been sold as one lot and should be of interest to military historians and collectors of World War II memorabilia. Mrs Carr worked at the tribunal for 32 months. In November 1945, the landmark Nuremberg trials began. Twelve of the 23 defendants, including Hitler aide Hermann Goering, were sentenced to death. Almost seven decades after the war, many institutions, including the Harvard Law School Library, have extensive collections of Nuremberg trial documentation, said Ed Moloy, curator of modern manuscripts at the Harvard library. While the Carr collection is interesting, it's likely not particularly unique, he said. Christine Hill, pictured with her husband Duane said reading the Carr collection was quite 'chilling' Among the documents held in the collection are a list of the senior Nazis who were on trial for their lives . The special collection will be auctioned with other Nazi-era memorabilia on Saturday in Anchorage, Alaska . But it might appeal to a private collector who wants such documents that are not already housed in a repository such as the Harvard library, which has 600 linear feet of Nuremberg documents. Mr Moloy said: 'It's very possible that people like Miss Carr, who was part of this pool of civilians working to support the trials, ended up with extra copies or something and saved them for souvenirs,' 'That's what I would assume this collection is.' Last year, other Nuremberg documents surfaced in Israel at a flea market in Tel Aviv. That 500-page haul eventually ended up at auction, too, where they sold for a price tag in the $10,000 range. Personal correspondence found in the trunk also hints of dissatisfaction with her position as a clerk-stenographer with the Civil Aeronautics Administration for war-training service before the war trials started. The Carr collection is being sold without any reserve in one lot on Saturday according to the auctioneers . The sale includes a large amount of other Nazi memorabilia including flags, medals and badges . Carr received a job rating of 'fair' in 1944, and she filed an unsuccessful appeal to the Civil Service Commission to amend the evaluation to 'very good.' 'I performed a great deal more work than any other girl assigned to the same type of position, and I certainly believe that I should receive a higher rating than ""Fair"" for work completed, especially considering the unfavorable circumstances under which I had to work,' Carr wrote. In a May 1945 letter from the Efficiency Rating Board of Review, the board chair said Carr 'had not altogether convincingly rebutted' her supervisors' work appraisals. The Carr collection is being auctioned as one lot, with no minimum bidding set. Several other private collections of mementos from that era also are being auctioned and include Nazi arm bands, German and Russian medals, and a tiny Hitler propaganda booklet. There also are plenty of Alaska artifacts, such as ivory carvings, old photographs, even black bear and coyote head mounts. Little is known about Carr's time in Alaska, although a state fishing license was issued to her in 1951, when she was 29 years old. While in Alaska, she eventually used her married name, Maxine Sud, according state records. Carr died at least a decade ago, but it's not clear exactly when she passed away. Her 91-year-old widower, Chand Sud, lives in an Anchorage assisted living facility. Through the auction house, he declined to comment to The Associated Press. Hill said the widower was surprised to learn about the documents, although he knew of her Nuremberg past.","Maxine Carr worked as a stenographer at the Nazi war crimes tribunal .

"A pair of drinking buddies became friends after discovering they were married to the same woman. Chris Thomas and Peter Sherratt, both 47, met when they found they were both married to bigamist Karen Sherratt, 45. She is now out the picture - but their friendship has lasted in what they described as the 'only good thing' to come out their 'hellish' experience. Scroll down for video . Peter Sherratt (left) and Chris Thomas (right), became friends when they found they shared the same wife . Mr Sherratt (pictured) fell quickly for Karen after they met in 2005 and they married within a year in a lavish ceremony at Edinburgh Castle - but he walked out in 2006 when he found their shared accounts were empty . Former RAF serviceman Chris Thomas (pictured), who is now a gas engineer, married Karen in 2012 in front of 40 guests at Cardiff's Holiday Inn - but months later he found out she was already married when he found a petition for divorce from Mr Sherratt in her laptop bag . Wedding cheat Sherratt was jailed for four months this summer when she was convicted of bigamy. Her husbands could not contact each other before the trial was over due to the legal process – but when they met for a pint afterwards they struck up a close friendship. Mr Thomas, a former RAF serviceman, said: 'It might seem odd to some people that we get on so well. 'But we have an ex-wife in common. We have had a shared experience too. She had us both under her spell and our close friendship is a result of that.' Mr Sherratt, pictured after his wedding to Karen that took place at Edinburgh Castle, has since found a new partner . Mr Sherratt, pictured during happier times celebrating his 40th birthday, was smitten by Karen (to his left) when he first met her - but they split up when he found she was being deceptive about their finances . Mr Sherratt was immediately attracted to Karen (far right), an area manager for a food company, but shortly after the wedding in September 2006, cracks began to appear . Sherratt, an area manager for a food company, had already been married and divorced when she met Mr Sherratt, from Swansea, in 2005. Their relationship blossomed and they were married within a year. But shortly after the wedding, Mr Sherratt starting having serious concerns when the joint bank account he shared with his wife frequently crept into its overdraft. Just a year since they were married, Mr Sherratt left his wife at their marital home in Swansea. Six years later in 2012 Sherratt met Mr Thomas on a dating website – and he fell for her quickly, just like Mr Sherratt had. In a similar way to Mr Sherratt, he proposed quickly - within three and a half months. Only seven months since meeting Sherratt, the couple were married at Cardiff's Holiday Inn. But there was one serious hitch - although Sherratt was separated from Mr Sherratt, she had never formally divorced him and so they were still legally married. Mr Thomas found out about the bombshell last December when he found a petition for divorce from Mr Sherratt in his wife's laptop bag. Devastated, he took a copy and left it on the kitchen table for his wife to find, before leaving their home in Swansea - the same one she had shared with her former husband. He has since moved to Caerphilly. Similarly to his friend Mr Sherratt, Mr Thomas, from Caerphilly, became so taken with Karen he proposed very quickly and the couple married in March this year at the Holiday Inn, in Cardiff . The pair met on a dating site in April 2012 and got engaged four months later, before marrying last March . He then contacted Mr Sherratt to break the news to him. He said: 'I wanted him to know that I existed when I first found out. 'So I let his solicitor know that Karen had remarried and was a bigamist.' He added: 'As soon as it was ­discovered she was still married, our wedding became null and void. I'm thankful she has no claim over my home or assets but the betrayal has shattered my confidence. 'I don't trust my own judgement anymore and I'm off work with the stress of it all.' During her sentencing at Cardiff Crown Court in June, Mr Recorder IWL Jones told her: 'It is rare for a case like this to come before the court, especially one involving a woman. 'Bigamy is clearly a serious offence that strikes at the heart of the marriage system. 'I have no doubt at all that you are a deceitful and dishonest woman and that Mr Thomas is the victim. 'You cried during the course of this hearing, but I am by no means at all convinced that you are remorseful.' The pair have now struck up an unlikely friendship which they said was the 'only good thing' to come out of the hellish experience . The friends meet regularly for a beer and a game of pool in Bridgend, South Wales - which is half way between their homes in Caerphilly and Swansea . After she was jailed, Mr Sherratt and Mr Thomas met to discuss their respective marriages to the bigamist. Mr Thomas said: 'After the trial we became quite friendly and had some long chats over the phone about what we'd been through and the kind of woman she was. 'After that it was pretty clear we had this bonding ­experience and we were going to be mates for a long time. 'His friendship is the only good thing to come out of this hell.' Now the pair meet regularly for a beer and a game of pool. Mr Sherratt said: 'It's been almost seven years since I was in Karen's grip so I have moved on and found a new partner who I love and trust and that's a whole different experience for me. 'I look at Chris now and I can see his pain and anger and I've been there too, so I can hopefully help him to move on past his upset. 'But it is hard. You never get over the deception and feelings of being a fool.'","Chris Thomas and Peter Sherratt, both 47, met when they found they were both married to bigamist Karen Sherratt, 45 .

"Sallie Powell, now 47, suffered a range of horrific symptoms for seven years before discovering high levels of calcium were to blame . A mother struck down with a mystery illness for seven years finally diagnosed herself after Googling her symptoms on the internet in desperation. Sallie Powell was so bloated she looked nine months pregnant and the excruciating pains in her joints and overwhelming tiredness had forced her to give up work as a wedding photographer. Despite seeing several doctors - and even undergoing major surgery - her crippling symptoms continued. In desperation, she turned to the internet - and just moments later found the answer that would change her life. The search results indicated she was suffering from a condition called hyperparathyroidism. Here, tiny parathyroid glands in the neck which control calcium levels malfunction, causing an excess of calcium in the blood. This, in turn, was causing her symptoms such as memory loss, depression, extreme tiredness and bloating. The mother-of-one, now 47, says she had always been fit and healthy and loved her job as a wedding photographer. But a decade ago she began to suffer horrific pain in her shoulders, arms, hands and legs. 'At first doctors said it was arthritis, but tests proved otherwise,' she told MailOnline. 'It got to the point where I couldn't hold a camera any more. I was devastated.' As the months passed, she began to develop other worrying symptoms, such as severe memory loss and confusion. She said: ‘It was like I was trying to think through a fog. I’d start sentences then couldn’t find the word. 'I’d taken a job a new job at an electrical store, but I’d get confused at the till. ‘Or, I’d be going somewhere then forget where I was heading.’ Scroll down for video . Scared dementia was setting in, she avoided social situations and her relationship broke down. She also suffered crippling headaches, chest pains and heartburn - and felt constantly thirsty. 'When doctors kept suggesting depression and stress I wanted to scream - I knew it wasn’t just that,' says Ms Powell, who lives in Derby. Shortly after she was prescribed medication for high blood pressure - and says she became horrified at her appearance. 'When I looked in the mirror, I didn't recognise myself. My hair was falling out and my stomach was so bloated I looked like I was nine month’s pregnant. Ms Powell was so bloated she looked nine months pregnant - and even required surgery to expand her airways as her nose was so blocked she could barely breathe . ‘People kept asking me when the baby was due.' Doctors then suggested her symptoms could be down to the menopause - and scans revealed she had a condition called adenomyosis, which affects the lining of the uterus. But even a hysterectomy to try and solve the problem didn't help - and her health was rapidly deteriorating. Ms Powell said: ‘By now I was even struggling to breathe. I needed an operation to expand my airways. ‘And each day I could barely get off the sofa. I just wanted to sleep and I was dosed up on so many painkillers. ‘I felt I was dying and panicked what would happen to my son, Jordan, who was only 15 at the time.' The breakthrough moment came when she was having further tests one day. 'The consultant mentioned I had high calcium levels and told me I needed to go back to my GP. 'But when I got home, I researched my symptoms online - along with high calcium levels - and hyperparathyroidism came up. Courtesy of ParathyroidTV . She said: 'I felt I was dying and panicked what would happen to my son, Jordan. ‘It was like I was trying to think through a fog. I’d start sentences then couldn’t find the word' We all have four parathyroid glands - each the size of a grain of rice - in our neck, positioned behind the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone (PTH) to help control the levels of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D within the bones and blood. But if these glands produce too much PTH, these levels could be sent haywire, causing blood calcium levels to rise and blood phosphorus levels to fall - and symptoms such as Ms Powell's. The parathyroid glands are nothing to do with the thyroid gland. 'Parathyroid' means 'near the thyroid'. Parathyroid disorders should not be confused with an underactive thyroid or overactive thyroid. Hyperparathyroidism does not always cause symptoms. When high levels of calcium do cause symptoms, they can be mild or general, including: . Depression, fatigue, feeling thirsty and passing a lot of urine . Nausea and loss of appetite . Muscle weakness, constipation, stomach ache, loss of concentration . But, if left untreated, high blood levels of calcium can cause vomiting drowsiness . Dehydration, confusion, muscle spasms, bone pain or tenderness, irregular heart beat and high blood pressure . In severe cases, high levels of calcium can lead to loss of consciousness and coma. Source: NHS Choices . ‘When I read all the symptoms, such as joint pain, bloating, confusion, weakness, fatigue, memory loss, high blood pressure, heart burn, increased thirst, I realised they matched mine.’ There are four tiny glands in the neck called the parathyroid glands, responsible for controlling calcium levels. In hyperparathyroidism, one or more of the glands malfunctions, producing too much paraythroid hormone. This results in raised calcium levels in the blood, depositing it in and around the organs and the brain - like cholesterol clogs the arteries. It also causes calcium to be leeched out of bones and can lead to heart attacks, kidney failure and strokes. Shocked, Ms Powell printed off her findings and took them to her GP - only to be proved right. A scan confirmed she had a small benign tumour on one of her parathyroid glands which had caused it to malfunction, causing the raised calcium levels in her blood. ‘All my symptoms had been caused by too much calcium. The first signs had been the pains in my arms and legs, where the calcium was being leeched out of my bones. ‘My brain fog must have been caused by calcium deposits in my brain. ‘My heart burn and huge stomach - calcium in my gut, and my breathing problems calcium in my sinuses.' In severe cases, high levels of calcium can lead to loss of consciousness and coma. Ms Powell was told she would require surgery to remove the affected parathyroid gland. ‘In agony, I crawled into a hospital bed to undergo surgery. 'I went into surgery feeling 95, but after the operation I  woke up feeling 35. In desperation, she turned to the internet - and just moments later found the answer that would change her life. The search results indicated she was suffering from a condition called hyperparathyroidism. She has now joined an online support group to try and raise awareness of the condition . ‘I felt amazing. With all my debilitating symptoms gone, it was like getting my life back.’ But as time went on, she became upset by the years she had lost to the illness. Sallie, who now runs her own cleaning business, said: 'I lost seven years of my life and I may never have been cured if I hadn’t diagnosed myself. 'I don’t think there’s enough awareness of this debilitating and potentially life threatening condition'. She has now joined an online support group to try and raise awareness of hyperparathyroidism worldwide and offer advice. There is also concern that some patients are only offered surgery when their levels are very high. 'But put people can suffer debilitating symptoms at a lower level as in my case,' said Ms Powell. 'As a group we’re pressing to change regulations so that intervention occurs to take in lower level.' She has now written to medics across the UK and is travelling around the UK with an endocrinologist (a doctor specialising in hormones) to raise awareness of the condition. She said: ‘I really believe there could be thousands of people out there who are suffering similar symptoms caused by hyperparathyroidism but have no idea they have this condition.’ For more information, visit Parathyroid Disease Support and Awareness.","Sallie Powell, now 47, suffered for seven years before being diagnosed .

"Concerns are growing for the whereabouts of Megadeth singer Dave Mustaine's missing mother-in-law who disappeared from a park in San Diego County, California, on Saturday. Sally Estabrook, described as a 75-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease, was last seen at the Pinezanita RV Park & Campgrounds about 4 p.m. Her husband told deputies he returned from a shower and couldn't find her. Since then search and rescue teams from three counties and a federal agency have been searching for the missing woman. Concerns are growing for the whereabouts of Megadeth singer Dave Mustaine's missing mother-in-law Sally Estabrook, left, who disappeared from a park in San Diego County, California, on Saturday. The singer, who formed the thrash metal band in 1983, tweeted his fans on Monday asking them to 'please send good thoughts' to his wife Pam, 'and prayers from those of you who pray, as we search for her mom.' Thirty San Diego sheriff's search and rescue volunteers, including members of the Border Patrol Search, Trauma and Rescue Unit and search and rescue members from San Bernardino and Riverside are searching a six mile area around the campground, reports UT San Diego. Friends and family members have also been assisting along with two bloodhounds and a sheriff's helicopter. ‘It's hilly, rocky, and there are a lot of ravines,’ said sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell. ‘Our fear is that she feel down a hill and maybe injured herself.’ The thrash metal singer tweeted his fans on Monday asking them to 'send good thoughts' to his wife Pam .

Estabrook is described as 5 feet 4 inches tall, 145 pounds and has shoulder-length blond hair. She was last seen in a teal top and white, Capri pants. Alzheimer’s means she isn't very communicative, but she might respond to her name. Mustaine's daughter Electra also tweeted: 'Help find my beloved nana.

"Scroll down for video . A diver was given a rare treatment in a hyperbaric chamber to help him to recover from a near fatal diving accident on Lake Superior in Michigan. Terry Begnoche, 64, from Michigan was in the chamber for 53 hours at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis to receive the treatment under the watchful eye of a nurse. The chamber acted as a treatment room in which air pressure could be adjusted to give Begnoche a chance to clear out the damaging nitrogen bubbles he got following the dive that went wrong. Chamber: Terry Begnoche lies in a hyperbaric chamber at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota after a diving incident in Lake Superior that almost killed him . Begnoche and other volunteers had dived on September 18 to capture footage of a ship off the coast of Grand Marais, Michigan according to The Star Tribune. The divers used underwater lighting and a video camera to examine the recently discovered Nelson, a three-masted ship that sank off the coast of Grand Marais, Mich., in 1899. However, on his way down to dive, Begnoche forgot to put on weights. And whilst down there, he only had 20 minutes worth of oxygen to use as he dived to see the ship. After 19 minutes he started to rise from the depths of the lake and pointed a video camera back down at the ship on the lake’s floor as he ascended. But as he climbed, he soon realized  how rapidly he was rising past another diver. With over 40 years of experience he knew there was nothing he could do. Treatment: Terry Begnoche is brought into a hyperbaric chamber which heals patients by creating an oxygen-rich environment for severe wounds or conditions such as anemia or carbon monoxide poisoning . After he was hauled into the boat, he told the crew that he had lost control of his arms and legs and could feel prickly sensations in his body. A Coast Guard helicopter was called along with a boat from the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore Rangers. The national Divers Alert Network assessed his injuries and referred him to HCMC. 'Human soda bottle': Begnoche is still staging a recovery from the accident and cannot walk . During treatment, doctors suggested that his quick ascent from the water had caused nitrogen bubbles to form in his bloodstream, cutting off blood to his spinal cord and other parts of his body. Begnoche said: ‘What I was worried most about was holding my breath if I panicked, because that could have caused a fatal embolism in his lungs. Panic is what really kills people.’ Medics had to fly Begnoche on a low-altitude flight to Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis after he lost blood following the expedition. There, doctors immediately tried a rare treatment which they uncovered in a U.S. Navy Diving Manual. Dr. Chris Logue, medical director of HCMC’s center for hyperbaric medicine told The Star Tribune: ‘It’s really rare to have to do that protocol for a couple reasons. One is that most people die. They never make it to treatment.’ According to doctors, Begnoche's body had become like a 'human soda bottle' that had been shaken up but still had the top on it holding everything inside. So they opted to treat him with the hyperbaric chamber.The chamber used is known to mimic a depth pressure of 45 feet to 60 feet below the surface. Doctors had to make the chamber a depth of 165 feet which was only 10 feet above the chamber’s maximum limit to mimic Begnoche’s actual dive depth. It was hoped that the treatment would help get the nitrogen in his body from bubbles into a solution and allow it to escape his body slowly and safely. If Begnoche had come out of the lake slowly this would have occurred naturally. However, when the chamber reached its maximum depth, Kimberlee Nerling, a nurse who was inside the chamber with him said she saw Begnoche begin to move his arms. He has since regained control of his movements but cannot walk or move his legs. He continues to receive treatment in the hopes that he will be able to improve over time. But it is still unknown whether he will make a full recovery. ‘It’s such a rare event, it’s impossible to tell,’ Logue said. ‘What we’ve gained back, I’m thrilled about.’","Terry Begnoche, 64, forgot to put his weights on before the dive .

"Robin van Persie knew he couldn’t finish Holland’s final training session before the team flies out to Brazil with a missed penalty. The Manchester United striker was one of four Dutch players practising spot-kicks at end of a session open to fans at AZ Alkmaar’s AFAS Stadium but crashed his shot against the post with Louis Van Gaal watching on. There was a shake of the head, a tussle for the ball with Nigel De Jong, then a successful strike from 12 yards by Van Persie to put him in a positive frame of mind ahead of the heightened pressure to come.

"A worker at PC World planned a £38,000 robbery because his mum told him to, a court heard. Anthony Bradley, 22, succumbed to 'mummy pressure', and recruited a gunman for an inside job at the store in Kingston, Surrey, where both he and his mum Mina Bradley worked. Mina, 52, was assistant manager at the PC World store in Kingston, Surrey, where her son was a shop assistant. Described as a trusted . employee, she pressured Anthony into finding gunmen to rob the Fife Road . store on January 16 in an error-strewn raid. 'Mummy pressure': Mina Bradley, left, persuaded her son Anthony Bradley, right, to organise an armed robbery . She was jailed for seven years for conspiracy to rob and her son was given three years, also for conspiracy to rob, at Kingston Crown Court . Mr Bradley recruited gunman Michael Ward, 20, who was sentenced to five years for robbery and possessing an imitation firearm, and another unidentified accomplice. When they were arrested Ward and Mr Bradley admitted their guilt, but the mother-of-three continued to deny involvement in the raid, until she realised her son planned to testify against her. Anthony Bradley recruited gunmen to rob the PC World store where he and his mother worked in Kingston . Recorder Roberts said it was 'regrettable in the extreme' that Miss Bradley had involved her son, describing her as the 'chief instigator and planner'. Handing the prison term to Miss Bradley, of Robin Hood Way, Sutton, Mr Roberts said: 'I am satisfied that you were the chief instigator and planner in this very serious crime. 'You used your trusted position at this shop to steal a large sum of money, putting staff members, to whom you owed a duty of care, through a dreadful experience. 'They are the real victims of this crime, who, not knowing this was an inside job, believed their lives were at risk.' 'Not a deep thinker': Bradley got Michael Ward (pictured) and another man to conduct the raid . The court heard how Miss Bradley handed over security information to the robbers, told them when the store would be holding the most cash, and used her influence to change staff rotas on the day of the raid. The robbers threatened staff with an imitation Uzi sub-machine gun, snatched nearly £38,000 in cash, then fled the scene separately having argued over whether to steal laptops. Ward, described as 'not a deep thinker' was caught four days later trying to leave Holyhead ferry port in Wales to get to his native Ireland. DC Matt Benedict of Barnes Flying Squad said Miss Bradley abused her position as assistant manager and betrayed her son by involving him in the raid.

"Lloyd Dobrodumow, 45, admitted attacking Robert Smith after he dropped a can outside his shop . A hairdresser who once called himself 'The Demon Barber' has escaped jail after he slashed a man's neck with a cut-throat razor during a fight over littering. Lloyd Dobrodumow, 45, attacked Robert Smith after he dropped a can of beer outside his shop - Jack's in Newcastle - and left him with a 10cm wound to his throat. Newcastle Crown Court heard that Dobrodumow, who was carrying a razor, asked him to put the can in the bin before punching him with the blade still in his hand. Mr Smith, who was left bleeding from his neck, was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in the city and underwent surgery to repair the wound. Neil Pallister, prosecuting, said the defendant was at work with his wife and a female employee on June 10 at 5pm when the victim had been walking from the train station towards the shop. Mr Smith was carrying a plastic bag with alcohol in it and was drinking from a can. He said: 'He finished drinking from the can and tossed the can away. He recalls hearing a males voice saying, ""The bin is only f****** there."" 'Hearing this Mr Smith walks towards the defendant who was standing in the doorway of his shop.' An argument then broke out between the two men and various witnesses saw Dobrodumow trying to close the door of his shop but Mr Smith placed his foot in the door. Eventually Dobrodumow, who once ran a shop called The Demon Barber in Newcastle city centre, came out of his shop and witnesses saw Mr Smith swing the bag of lager at him. Dobrodumow then punched him in the face across his jaw with the hand in which he was holding the razor. Blood began to soak Mr Smith's T-shirt and witnesses then heard him demanding £10,000 from Dobrodumow to 'make it all go away'. The court heard Mr Smith was taken to hospital where he was immediately rushed into surgery as the main muscle had been cut and his saliva gland cut in two. Dobrodumow, pictured arriving at Newcastle Crown Court today, was given a suspended prison sentence . A forensics team outside the shop in the aftermath of the incident, which happened at rush hour on June 10 . Mr Pallister said Dobrodumow had a long history of domestic violence and had 17 previous convictions. But Toby Hedworth QC, defending, said Dobrodumow had been victim of a long series of anti-social behaviour outside his shop and had come to the end of his tether. Mr Hedworth said: 'Since moving to this part of the world from Yorkshire he has changed his behaviour, he's matured and he's kept himself clear from the kind of behaviour which categorised his life 15 years ago. 'The defendant acknowledges there became a stage after he had been significantly provoked that he had been seeking to defend himself and his occupants in the shop. Lloyd Dobrodumow, 44, at work as a barber and right, leaving North Tyneside Crown Court at an earlier hearing . 'He acknowledges that punching out when he did that particular act went past self-defence. 'He was reckless in that he had forgotten he had the razor in his hand. 'The defendant was immediately on the phone to the emergency services. 'He acknowledges that this is behaviour that although provoked is beyond what is acceptable.' He also said witnesses had heard Mr Smith threatening to kill him, steal his dog and call his wife a slut. He also said he had showed 'genuine tearful remorse' after the incident. An officer stands outside Jack's in Newcastle after the attack. Blood can be seen on the pavement by the door . Judge Tom Little accepted that there had been no intent in the injury as the blade was something he used every day at work and he did not realise it was still in his hand at the time. 'I have agonised long and hard about this decision and I'm just persuaded to suspend the sentence,' he said. 'I do this for the remorse you have shown which in my judgment is genuine.' Dobrodumow, of Bensham in Gateshead, admitted unlawful wounding and was given a 12 month suspended sentence, a 12 month supervision requirement with 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also told to pay £5,000 compensation and £700 costs.","Lloyd Dobrodumow, 45, admitted attacking Robert Smith outside shop .

Wilshere also spoke to Sky Sports TV cameras, saying: 'It's hard to find the words, we waited a long time for this, we waited nine years. 'We failed a few years ago in the Carling Cup, we all felt that.' 'We had a tough run in the FA Cup, so you can't say we didn't deserve it.'

"Prosecutors in Montana say a man caught leaving a house he had apparently burglarized apologized to the homeowner and offered him some heroin. The Billings Gazette reports Christopher Dayell Bittner made an initial court appearance Monday on felony burglary and drug possession charges. Authorities say the homeowner and his seven-year-old son came home as Bittner was leaving Saturday. Yellowstone County Attorney Paul Adam says Bittner apologized and offered the drug. Apologetic: Christopher Dayell Bittner - pictured here from a family member's Facebook page - allegedly offered a homeowner in Billings, Montana, some heroin after being caught burglarizing the man's house . He was found nearby, and court records say a search of his backpack turned up 31.5 grams of heroin, seven syriunges, other drug paraphernalia and items belonging to the homeowner. Bittner allegedly stole a sweatshirt, art box and face cream from the house. He also reportedly offered to sell the homeowner a guitar he had with him during their counter. Public defender Roberta Drew asked that Bittner be released without bail because he wanted to attend his father's funeral. Bail was set at $7,500, but Bittner was allowed to attend the service.","Christopher Dayell Bittner was allegedly caught burglarizing a house in Billings, Montana, on Monday .

"Motorists are not seeing the benefit of a drop in oil prices (File photo) Motorists are paying ‘rip-off’ fuel prices at the pumps because falling petrol prices are failing to keep pace with plummeting oil costs, motoring groups warned last night. Although forecourt prices are falling – driven largely by supermarkets cutting their pump prices – it is claimed up to 4p per litre on average has yet to be passed on to drivers following a 2p drop since September. And drivers in rural areas are being hit harder because there are fewer supermarket competitors to kick-start a price cut. As a result motorists face a post-code lottery over the extent to which they benefit from crude oil prices tumbling on international markets. Some filling stations just a few miles apart are charging up to 14p per litre difference at the pumps. It comes as oil prices dropped to below $84 (£52) a barrel on US markets because of weak demand and fears of a global economic slump. The AA said that since the beginning of September alone Brent crude has fallen from $101 (£63) to $85 (£53) a barrel – a fall of 15.8 per cent. Even allowing for currency fluctuations, that represents a fall of around 12.4 per cent worth up to 6p at the pumps. Yet only 2p of that has so far filtered through, says the AA. Motorists deserve at least another 4p off at the pumps – and more if oil prices continue to fall, says the motoring organisation. The AA’s fuels expert Luke Bosdet said: ‘Are motorists being ripped off? Absolutely, they are being ripped off. And at some of the motorway stations they are being well and truly fleeced.’ He said; ‘Fuel prices are moving. Our concern is that they are not moving fast enough. And they’re not moving everywhere. ‘It is fascinating how when oil prices rise quickly, pump prices follow hard on their heels.. ‘Yet when oil prices fall, many retailers appear to drag their feet. ‘So motorists see the cost of their motoring rocket up as oil prices increase, yet fall like a feather when they drop.’ Mr Bosdet said: ‘Supermarkets such as Asda, Tesco and now Sainsbury’s have been leading the charge in cutting prices as oil has fallen on international markets. ‘But the rest of the market is taking its time to pass on the benefits to motorists. So if you don’t have a supermarket in your area – especially if you live in the countryside – you will get hammered.’ The AA noted how petrol in the Shropshire market town of Market Drayton was selling for a hefty 127.9p a litre. Yet just a few miles away in Stoke on Trent – where there is more competition - it cost 122.9p a litre – a difference of 5p. Similarly at Midhurst in West Sussex, petrol was selling at 128.9p a litre, while 7 miles away in Liphook, Sainsbury’s were selling it at 123.9p, also 5p cheaper. Motorists deserve at least another 4p off at the pumps – and more if oil prices continue to fall, says the AA . The AA’s Mr Bosdet said: ‘The small rural towns are being well and truly hammered. They are being charged up to 129p a litre for petrol when in parts of London it coasts 122p – a difference of 7p.’ Some motorway service stations are also milking it, the AA warned. It noted how Sainsbury’s in Berkshire was selling unleaded at 123.9p a litre. Yet just four miles up the road at Chieveley Motorway Service station on the M4/A34 junction, unleaded was selling at 137.9p – a difference of 14p per litre. Mr Bosdet said: ‘This once again underlines the need for transparency at oil, wholesale and retail levels so that drivers can see if they are getting a fair price at the pump.’ Yesterday three of the UK’s major supermarkets stepped up their forecourt price war. Sainsbury’s and rival Asda cut the price of diesel by up to 2p a litre and unleaded petrol by a penny. Asda, which has 232 forecourts, said its customers will pay no more than 126.7p a litre for diesel and 123.7p per litre for unleaded petrol. Tesco, which is Britain’s biggest petrol retailer with about 500 petrol stations, cut unleaded petrol by 1p per litre, with diesel reducing by at least 1p a litre although some sites will get a 2p a litre price cut. The supermarkets have been slashing forecourt prices to win back grocery customers from discount rivals Aldi and Lidl. AA president Edmund King said: ‘As always it’s a roller coaster for drivers. We should see some further reductions in prices at the pumps as long as the markets don’t turn quickly and fuel retailers grab extra profit. ‘Drivers haven’t seen such prices since 2011 but oil prices are still volatile and more global unrest in oil producing countries can just as easily send the price spiralling again.’ A typical 50 litre tank of unleaded petrol now costs around £2.50 less than it did a year ago and a 55 litre tank of diesel is around £4 cheaper. Global oil prices have fallen further after the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported higher output and cut its forecast for demand-led growth. But the oil cartel OPEC – the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries - which produces about 40per cent of the world’s crude oil, has so far shown no sign of turning off the tap reducing supply. Last week, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global economic growth for this year and next, warning that the recovery was ‘weak and uneven’. The RAC said: ‘It’s good that prices are coming down but there’s still room for them to come down further. We reckon another 4p. It needs t be passed on to motorists.’ Yesterday Brent crude oil - which is traded in dollars - started the day at $85.50 (£53) a barrel., slumping to below $83.5 (£52) by lunchtime, before bouncing back up towards $85. In the US oil began at just over $82 (£51), dipped to $80.5 before creeping up to $82.","Petrol price drops driven by supermarkets cutting forecourt costs .

"A young couple’s love has reached new heights after they got engaged in front of dozens of strangers on board a plane over Texas. Keegan Johns, 23, surprised his 21-year-old girlfriend, Molly Burns, with a heart-warming proposal that was caught on camera at 33,000ft. The stunned bride-to-be smiled, laughed and said ‘Yes’ before the couple embraced each other in the aisle as passengers applauded and cheered. Will you marry me? Keegan Johns proposed to his girlfriend, Molly Burns, on a Southwest Airlines flight . Happy couple: Keegan Johns and Molly Burns met in 2010 when they worked together at a restaurant . Keegan, an investment specialist, popped the question while the Southwest Airlines plane was flying from Dallas to Houston on Saturday. But Molly, a team leader with a cosmetics company, caught on just before the mid-air proposal when Keegan handed her a card with a sweet note written inside. She told MailOnline Travel: 'I had no idea he was going to propose. He told me he had to go to the bathroom. But before he got up he tossed me a card and said, ""I got this for you, read it right now"". 'I thought it was thoughtful of him to write me a card. When I read it I knew he wasn't really in the bathroom.' Young love: Keegan decided to pop the question at 33,000ft because of Molly's love for planes . Molly added: 'I got really nervous and red because I don't like being the centre of attention, so I thought, ""Cr**, he's gonna do it in front of all these people."" 'I was shaking but obviously happy. Then he came on over the intercom.' When Keegan returned to his seat he dropped to one knee and asked Molly for her hand in marriage. Passengers offered their congratulations and asked to see Molly's engagement ring. In love: Molly says she caught on to Keegan's plan once he handed her a card and got out of his seat . The pair first met in 2010 when they worked together at a restaurant but they didn't spend time together until January of this year after Molly contacted Keegan on Facebook. Each has a four-year-old son from a previous relationship and they took the boys on a play date at a children's museum in their hometown of St Louis. That's when the couple's romance began to bloom. Molly has long had a love for aeroplanes and aeronautics, so she suspected Keegan’s eventual proposal might involve planes. The couple was travelling to Houston to watch an air show featuring the Blue Angels, the US Navy’s flight demonstration squadron - equivalent of the British Red Arrows. Keegan said: 'Molly loves airplanes. At one point she thought she might be a pilot even. So we were on our way to an air show in Houston, Texas, to see the Blue Angels. Molly thought that I would propose to her there, I'm sure.' The couple was travelling to Houston for an air show featuring the US Navy’s flight demonstration squadron . Keegan planned the proposal in advance and had a little bit of help from Southwest Airlines staff. Before boarding the plane he informed the flight attendants of his plans and they made sure a bottle of champagne was on hand when Molly accepted his proposal. When the plane landed in Houston the couple was greeted by Keegan’s excited relatives, who brought a homemade sign reading: ‘Welcome Molly to the crazy Johns family’. The couple has been flooded with messages from well-wishers and the proposal has received plenty of attention after it was covered by media in the US. Keegan said: ‘All the attention from our proposal has been very interesting. I asked Molly to marry me on a plane because I want to show her off and tell as many people as possible that I love her. So this extra unintentional attention is only helping my cause.’ Molly added: ‘We never thought people would care this much. It makes us feel special. Plus, we have the best proposal story ever.’","Keegan Johns popped the question while flying from Dallas to Houston .

"John Watson competed in 152 Formula One races over 10 years. He won five times, including the 1981 British Grand Prix for McLaren, and scored 169 career points. After leaving the sport in 1985, Watson has forged a successful media career, and today he writes for MailOnline. Following the fall-out from the Monaco Grand Prix, Watson assesses the fractious relationship beetween Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, and asks whether Mercedes could have handled the situation in a better fashion. If you go back to qualifying, I can understand why Lewis Hamilton was upset because he did not do anything wrong and he got caught up in Nico Rosberg’s incident which, in my opinion, was not pre-meditated. That said, it did work advantageously for Rosberg. I had an incident for McLaren at the 1980 Monaco Grand Prix where I didn’t qualify for the race and I was overly negative about everything. From then I learned that all you can do is put what has happened behind you. You cannot change it, so there is no point carrying the grudge forward. If Hamilton wanted to believe Rosberg’s accident was pre-meditated then there is nothing anyone could have said to him to change his mind. But nonetheless, it is history and you can’t do anything about it. Frosty: Lewis Hamilton's attitude after Nico Rosberg's 'error' in qualifying reflected badly and didn't help him . Controversial: Rosberg was forced to take to the escape road on his final run in Saturday's qualifying session . It reflected badly on him that he retained the grudge, taking it right through to Saturday evening, then the race, the podium, and, I gather, later on when the pair of them were out that evening socialising. Both Hamilton and Rosberg are playing mind games, and on this occasion Rosberg won the battle, and he won the grand prix, too. Hamilton was irked about the pit-stops, but that is what happens during a safety car period. It is almost as if he has got a conspiracy theory going on in his head that he was being conspired against by his own team, which is not the case, but to be honest they are both acting like a couple of pre-pubescent girls in the playground. Formula One has always needed a ruck of this nature going on in a team. You had it with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, and you had it with Niki Lauda and James Hunt, although they were at rival teams, but it doesn’t do the sport any harm. The trouble comes with the fact that Formula One is potentially a dangerous sport, but both drivers behaved in the correct manner on Sunday and had the right wisdom and insight to leave their handbags off the circuit. There was a foundation of truth in Hamilton’s comments before the race that he is hungrier than Rosberg because of their differing backgrounds, but lest us not forget that Hamilton got picked up by McLaren when he was 12, and all his motor-racing from that point forward was paid for by Mercedes and McLaren and Ron Dennis. But while he may have grown up in Stevenage he is not a child anymore, he is a man. Differing moods: Nico Rosberg puts his thumbs up while Lewis Hamilton storms off after Monaco qualifying . It is phenomenal what he has achieved in F1 and he has achieved it from the determination, in part of his start in life, but he has to move on. Both Hamilton and Rosberg have grown up in a gilded world which is as real as fantasy is. They are not emotionally equipped or developed to know how to deal with this battle, and I don’t believe there is anyone of the quality of Ross Brawn at Mercedes who has that ability either. Indeed, if Brawn had been running the team, as he had been up until last year, the situation between the two drivers would have been handled a lot better. What you have got now at Mercedes is a very different management structure based on a different platform with different managers all at a similar level. Then you have got Niki Lauda acting as ‘the Godfather’. Lauda is on record as saying Hamilton was ‘unbeatable’ after winning in China, Bahrain and Spain, and I have no doubt that there will have been an element of “what about me?” from Rosberg. In Spain, his body language was not positive. I noticed that when they were doing the group photograph, they all gave a big cheer, but Rosberg didn’t. Tough day: Hamilton complained about getting dirt in his eye... it was a disappointing weekend . Pressure: Mercedes director Toto Wolff must try and control the duo . Unconciusly, the team gravitates towards the the driver who is getting the job done, and ahead of the race in Monaco that would have been Hamilton. So, Rosberg will have begun to feel that he was getting subjugated out of the picture because everything was focused on Hamilton - the Briton having won four races on the spin. Also, in Spain, it turned out that Hamilton had used a power boost button, which is saved for qualifying principally, during the race to defend his position against Rosberg who was catching him up. He shouldn’t have done that, and suddenly, all those resentments from Rosberg build into big issues. Niki said he will ‘sort it out’, and he is a very pragmatic man, but in a sense he is part of the problem because has been ‘bigging up’ Hamilton. I don’t see anyone at Mercedes with the authority, the credibility and the gravitas that Brawn had. If you think back to last year’s Malaysian Grand Prix, Rosberg wanted to catch and pass Hamilton, and Brawn emphatically said: “No. Hold position.” It is not just what you say, it is the way you say it and it is the person who says it. Rosberg thought about it, but then obeyed the command. Conflict: Mercedes team boss Niki Lauda may have upset Rosberg by saying Hamilton was 'unbeatable' Is Toto Wolff more interested in talking to the press and projecting himself? Does he really have the authority? And what of Paddy Lowe? He is a fantastic guy, but he is not the person to deal with this feud. Lauda is a very clever man, but I don’t know what authority he has either. At the end of the day, if there was one person who could kick ass in that team, it is the person that they let go. Formula One isn’t like golf, tennis, boxing or any other individual sport. You are playing for a team, and there are responsibilities that come with that. It goes back to having someone on the pit-wall with authority that everybody in the team - drivers, engineers, whoever - actually respect. And at the minute there is nobody I see at Mercedes who has that level of respect within that management structure that Ross Brawn would have carried.

"The FBI's director warned technology firms not to encrypt smartphone data and operating systems because it risks stalling murder investigations and allowing suspects to walk free. James Comey said justice could be thwarted by a locked phone or an encrypted hard drive, likening encrypted data to a safe that cannot be cracked or a closet door that won't open. He said the move by tech companies to protect user communications in the name of privacy is certain to impede a wide range of criminal investigations. New legislation to allow law enforcement to intercept communications is needed at a time of advancing technology and new forms of communication, he added. Warning: FBI director James Comey said justice could be thwarted by a locked phone or an encrypted hard drive, likening encrypted data to a safe that cannot be cracked or a closet door that won't open . But privacy advocates and technology experts hit back at his plea, saying the concerns are exaggerated and little more than recycled arguments the government has raised against encryption since the early 1990s. 'We have the legal authority to intercept and access communications from information pursuant to court order, but we often lack the technical ability to do so,' Comey said in a Brookings Institution speech. Comey cited particular cases in which he said access to cell phone data aided in a criminal investigation. But in a question-and-answer session after the speech, he said he could not cite particular instances in which someone was rescued from danger who wouldn't have been had law enforcement been blocked from that information. 'Rescuing someone before they're harmed? Someone in the trunk of a car or something?' Comey asked. 'I don't think I know yet.' Unstuck: Comey also said the FBI was committed to a 'front-door' approach, through court orders and under strict oversight, to intercepting communications . But, he added, 'Logic tells me there are going to be cases just like that.' The speech, which echoes concerns he and others in law enforcement have previously made, comes soon after announcements by Apple and Google that their new operating systems will be encrypted, or protected with coding by default. Law enforcement officials could still intercept conversations but might not be able to access call data, contacts, photos and email stored on the phone. While the companies' actions are understandable, Comey said, 'the place they are leading us is one we shouldn't go to without careful thought and debate.' 'Encryption isn't just a technical feature. It's a marketing pitch. But it will have very serious consequences for law enforcement and national security agencies at every level,' Comey said. The government's concerns may also center in part on the use of Apple's iMessage platform, which offers end-to-end encrypted text messages that supersede traditional SMS messages. That kind of encryption likely provides access to those messages on users' iPhones, of which Apple has sold more than 240 million since 2013. Default code: The speech, which echoes concerns he and others in law enforcement have previously made, comes soon after announcements by Apple and Google that their new operating systems will be encrypted, or protected with coding by default . He acknowledged a rise in public mistrust of government in the year since former National Security Agency systems analyst revealed NSA secret intelligence collection programs. But he said the public was wrong to believe that law enforcement can access any and all communications with the flip of a switch. 'It may be true in the movies or on TV. It is simply not the case in real life,' he said. Comey also said the FBI was committed to a 'front-door' approach, through court orders and under strict oversight, to intercepting communications. Privacy advocates have long been concerned that that development would create an opening for hackers to exploit.  The American Civil Liberties Union noted that federal law protects the right of companies to add encryption with no backdoors and said the companies should be credited for being 'unwilling to weaken security for everyone.' 'Whether you call it a 'front door' or a 'back door,' weakening the security of a system to enable law enforcement access also opens that door to foreign governments and criminals,' said Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. Matthew Green, a cryptology professor at Johns Hopkins University, said the debate over personal encryption isn't new: Back in the 1990s, when personal computers were a novelty, he said most consumers weren't even aware of encryption. When a form of email encryption called PGP was released, he said, there was a fear that criminals would use it. 'These technologies exist' for consumers to protect their privacy, he said, 'and it's very hard to do anything about it.' The Center for Democracy and Technology said in a statement that law enforcement already has ways to obtain the electronic data it needs. 'Encryption of our personal devices and communications enhances the security of our most private information,' the center said.","James Comey likened encrypted phone to a safe that cannot be unlocked .

"A husband who rented a billboard in an attempt to find his wife a new kidney says he is reminded of her every time he drives by the sign he rented to try and save her life. Jim Nelson's wife Sharon, from Salinas, Kansas, was on a transplant waiting list, before the couple decided to take matters into their own hands. They decided to head out onto the highway where Mr Nelson climbed up onto the board to paint their message. Wanted: A Kansas couple decided to take matters into their own hands. Sharon Nelson, 73, and her husband James, 70, rented a billboard on Interstate 70 in Jewell, to advertise Sharon’s plight for a new kidney . Experienced: Jim, a Vietnam veteran and former mural painter, borrowed a 12-foot ladder and painted 'I Need A Kidney' along with his phone number on the white billboard . Tedious: Sharon Nelson had been in and out of hospitals since she was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in 2008, and since 2009 she had been on dialysis because the cancer treatment damaged her kidneys . On an overcast morning last December, Jim parked his truck on the side of Interstate 70, gathered a few supplies and headed over to a blank billboard he had leased a day earlier, at a discount from a friend. Mr Nelson, a Vietnam veteran and former mural painter, borrowed a12-foot ladder and painted 'I Need A Kidney?' along with his phone number. 'We decided it was worth a try,' she said. 'It was so cold when he was on the ladder. The ladder was unstable because the ground was uneven. I was in the pickup, ready to call 911 if he fell off.' Mrs Nelson said. Although his wife died just a few weeks ago, his cause and effort to find his beloved a transplant was a valiant one. Mrs Nelson had been in and out of hospitals since she was diagnosed withbone marrow cancer in 2008, and since 2009 she had been on dialysis. Jim dedicated himself to learning everything there was to know about kidney donations. Hoping: Numerous people came forward looking to donate a kidney but none of the offers crystallized . Last chance: Jim painted the sign last December. He climbed a ladder and began painting the sign he hoped would save his wife’s life . New lease: The sign, and everything that followed it, seemed to rejuvenate Sharon, who had borne years of treatment. She seemed to get great joy out of her conversations with callers, making at least one new friend . Depair: For all the calls they received, for all the kind words and prayers and encouragement, no concrete leads materialized and Sharon passed away in September . A final goodbye: In September, Sharon’s health took a turn for the worse. Jim told her how he felt about her but held out hope . When Sharon began using a home dialysis system, he learned how to help operate it, and when home dialysis was no longer possible, he drove her 65 miles round trip to the hospital in Concrodia, three times a week, so it could be done there. Between treatments, he tried to keep her as comfortable as possible. He made up a little bed in the backseat of the couple's car, with pillows and blankets, and drove her to one of the local fairs . In 2010 she began considering a transplant and the search for a potential donor began. She was then approved for a transplant in February. but the search for a matching donor wasn't easy. Sharon had type O blood, and she can only receive a kidney from a donor with the same blood type, . In the months before her death, numerous people got in touch hoping to help out, but none were a match. Several volunteered to be her donor but none were acceptable candidates, others called to let Jim and Sharon know that they were thinking about them, praying for them. Most, though, offered their own kidneys, assuming it was feasible. 'One of the people, who is a perfect blood match, had had tuberculosis, so they were unable to donate and the other phone calls have been the wrong blood type,' she said. 'We have had a great number of phone calls,' she said. 'It is an impulsive thing, offering to give your kidney. We have been very grateful. It was a wonderful response and our community has been very supportive.' In the weeks after the sign went up, it all seemed possible. Jim started to feel like his idea might actually work and that it was only a matter of time before the right person saw it. The sign, and everything that followed it, seemed to rejuvenate Sharon, and she enjoyed chatting with callers. 'She was her old self again,' Jim says. 'Just chipper and positive-thinking, and just upbeat.' But days turned into week and weeks turned into months. No regrets: In the weeks since the funeral, Jim had tried to come to grips with the loss. He still blames and wonders if there was something else he could have done to save his wife's life . Moving on: The sign on the Interstate is gone and so is his wife, but he is left with a lifetime of happy memories . Jim pursued any option he could think of. He wrote letters to universities that were on the cutting edge of kidney research. He called different institutions, trying to get Sharon into experimental programs but it made no difference. In September, Sharon's health took a turn for the worse and after coming down with a fever and chills she passed away one fall afternoon. As Jim come attempted to come to terms with the loss of his wife he keeps wondering if there was something more he could have done. His message on the sign is gone now. He parked his truck on the side of I-70 to paint the sign away. As he did so, he wiped the tears from his eyes, thankful for the time he and his wife got to spend with one another, grateful for the kindness of strangers, and happy thinking of the times that will live long in the memory.

"Workers punching in for the graveyard shift should avoid steak and spinach, as new research shows eating foods high in iron disrupts the body clock. The body's circadian clocks regulate sleeping, waking and digesting food over a 24 hour period. These cycles activate processes in all the cells in the human body, affecting the release of hormones controlling metabolism and other functions. Shift workers should avoid eating foods rich in iron - such as steak - late at night, as it disrupts the body clock and could increase the risk of obesity, diabetes, stroke and cancer . The brain is the body's 'master' circadian clock, ensuring all the other body clocks are in sync. It is set by light, telling us to wake up in the morning and sleep when it's dark. Night shifts disrupt this natural cycle, and it is known that people who work these have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, obesity and cancer. Researchers have now discovered that eating iron-rich foods disrupts the circadian clock in the liver, which helps maintain constant blood sugar levels to give body cells enough energy. Normally the liver's circadian clock maintains a constant blood sugar level when a person is asleep. The level then spikes just before they wake up. Iron acts like a cog in the liver's circadian clock, prompting the liver to go into overdrive, strictly controlling blood sugar levels, preventing the spike. This would be healthy when it occurs in the liver's natural clock cycle. But if it happens at a time that is out of sync, such as during a night shift, it could result in abnormal blood sugar levels. For night shift workers, the circadian clock of the liver is already out of sync with the brain's circadian clock, and eating iron could exacerbate that lack of synchronisation. This could lead to diseases like obesity, diabetes, and stroke, the researchers said. Iron-rich foods include: . As part of the study researchers fed iron to mice as part of their natural eating cycle. They found that iron in the diet increases the concentration of heme, an oxygen-carrying compound found in haemoglobin, in cells. When heme binds to a circadian protein, the protein's activity increases. This causes the liver to increase its activity of controlling blood sugar levels. Therefore, eating iron-rich foods caused the liver to increase its activity in regulating blood sugar. This interferes with the normal fluctuations associated with a healthy metabolic system and leads to diseases like obesity, cancer, diabetes and stroke. The study's lead author Judith Simcox, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah said: 'Iron is like the dial that sets the timing of the clock. 'Discovering a factor, such as iron, that sets the circadian rhythm of the liver may have broad implications for people who do shift work.' Another of the study's authors Professor Donald McClain, also of the University of Utah, added: 'When a shift worker eats foods high in iron at night it could exacerbate the lack of synchronsation between the clock in the liver and the main one in the brain. 'By tending to flatten the circadian variation of metabolism, high iron in tissues may also interfere with the normal day to night fluctuations associated with a healthy metabolic system.' The study appeared online in the journal Diabetes. Previous studies have found that shift workers experience higher incidences of obesity, diabetes and other metabolic disorders due to disruptions to their circadian clocks .","Eating iron-rich foods disrupts the circadian clock in the liver .
Liver's circadian clock normally regulates blood sugar levels .
Iron causes the liver to control blood sugar more strictly .
This would be healthy if it happened in the liver's natural cycle .

According to KTLA two were pronounced dead at the scene while one died as paramedics prepared to take her to hospital. A Nissan Pathfinder, the vehicle which is believed to have been driven into them was found nearby after officers said the suspects sped off and headed north in the aftermath. Police are said to be looking for two men who were in the car at the time of the incident. A large crime scene has now been set up. Jeff Evans, who was trick-or-treating with his eight-year-old daughter nearby at the time said he heard squealing tires, looked over and saw the gruseome scene.

"The three Afghanistan National Army officers who attempted to escape to Canada spent more than $1,600 on taxis to travel to the border after researching an escape route on YouTube. Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar vanished from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, last month and were picked up at a border checkpoint in Niagara Falls. The men had been participating  in a joint military exercise at Camp Edwards when they seized the opportunity to make their getaway during a group outing to Walmart. Scroll down for video . Major Jan Mohammad Arash (left), Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada (centre) and Captain Noorullah Aminyar (right) vanished during a training exercise at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, last month . Now they are fighting deportation from a US immigration jail in upstate New York, as they say to send them back to the Afghan army would be to give them a death sentence. Speaking for the first time to the Boston Globe, in three separate interviews the soldiers said the Taliban are targeting them for fighting alongside the Americans, and they are constantly dodging sniper fire for $400 to $500 a month in pay and little protection. 'They catch us, they kill us,' Major  Arash, 48, said of the Taliban. 'They tip those who kill us.' The trio say they sought asylum in Canada because they thought it more likely to grant them protection than the United States. On September 20, the foreign soldiers training at Camp Edwards were given  three hours off duty and two of the Afghan men - Captain Askarzada and Captain Aminyar - split from the group and visited the Walmart. Captain Askarzada had previously showed the other a YouTube video of people crossing the border into Canada at the Rainbow Bridge - a route popular with tourists. The soldiers had been due to take part in U.S. Central Command's Regional Cooperation exercise, which is held every year to foster better cooperation and military readiness between participating countries. Two of the soldiers had watched a YouTube video of people crossing the border into Canada at Rainbow Bridge . A United States Boarder Patrol carat Rainbow Bridge. The trio say they sought asylum in Canada because they thought it more likely to grant them protection than the United States . The men, who were cleared by the US State Department to participate, had been free to 'come and go' when they weren't taking part in exercises. 'If they were off-duty, they could go to McDonald's or the mall,' Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. James Sahady told Cape Cod Online. Major Arash, said he followed the two men and said he was going with them, despite their initial efforts to lose him. 'I told them I don't have money,' Major Arash said in his interview with the Globe. 'They told me, 'We have a little. Come on'.' The three men jumped in a taxi and between them shelled out more than $1,600 to travel to Boston and then on to Niagara Falls. At Cape Cod, US soldiers frantically searched for the men at the Walmart. They even approached a strip club, where the owner said he believes the men visited - something all three vehemently deny. The three Afghanistan National Army soldiers vanished  from Joint Base Cape Cod during a training exercise . Captain Aminyar said they made it to Niagara Falls early on September 22 and they spent some time in the park, before attempting to make the crossing. But when the three soldiers reached the Canadian side at about 10am they were turned back by the authorities, because of an agreement with the United States regarding asylum seekers. The three soldiers are set to appear in immigration court in Batavia later today. They say that if they are deported they fear reprisals from the Afghan government, which inaugurated new leadership this week. Family members of two soldiers have reported recent death threats in Afghanistan. The trio were stopped at the Rainbow Bridge. It cost them $1,600 to reach the crossing from Cape Cod . Captain Aminyar, a 30-year-old former platoon leader, said just days after he arrived on Cape Cod on September 10, the Taliban went to his family's compound in Nangarhar province searching for him. 'Their leaders, they give the orders to kill me. My father told me the story,' he told the Globe. ''They will find you and they will kill you'. ' He said  he fears for his life, and the lives of his family, including five children. The soldiers are due to appear before immigration Judge Steven Connelly today, who has approved just 10 per cent of his asylum cases in the past five years, according to TRAC, a research organization at Syracuse University. 'I hope they will not make the wrong decision about us and they will help us,' Captain Aminyar added. 'We work with the United States. We fight with them, we fight together, shoulder by shoulder. Now is the time they should help me.'

"A woman-only taxi service has been forced to apply the brakes after it failed to attract enough female drivers into the job. The New York-based SheTaxi iPhone app was created for women who feel uneasy getting into a cab alone with a male driver because of safety concerns or religious beliefs. Currently only three per cent of New York's 115,000 taxi drivers are female, so SheTaxi - which was scheduled for launch yesterday - was built to book only taxis driven by a woman for its users. The release of the app has now been delayed by owner Stella Mateo however, after she said it would not be financially viable until at least another 400 female drivers register with the company. Scroll down for video . Apply the brakes: Dinorah De Cruz  is one of 100 women currently signed up to drive for SheRides - an iPhone app helping female passengers locate women taxi drivers in New York City. The launch of the app has  been delayed until at least another 400 female drivers register with the service . Mateo said about 100 women have signed up as drivers so far. They will wear bright pink pashmina scarves, making it easy to identify them. 'In the taxi and livery industry, where women comprise less than 3 per cent of drivers but 60 per cent of riders, women's needs go unmet on either side of the partition,' said Mateo, whose husband Fernando is founder of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers. 'Why don't we have female drivers exclusively for female riders?', she added at a news conference yesterday. SheTaxis is the name of the service in the New York suburbs, while SheRides is used in the city itself, which has regulations governing the use of 'taxi' in a name. When it is eventually launched, the app will be available for the iPhone initially - before an Android version is eventually launched. There also are plans to expand to other U.S. cities. Going places: Driver Dinorah De Cruz (left) talks with Stella Mateo (right) - founder of the SheTaxi car service. Drivers will be required to wear bright pink pashmina scarves, making them easy to identify . Mateo said the service, which will use an Uber-like smartphone app, determined that demand would outstrip the capacity of the 100 female drivers currently available to fulfill requests. Access to female drivers, she said, would particularly help some Muslim and Orthodox Jewish women whose religious beliefs prohibit them from traveling alone with unrelated men. She said that encouraging women to drive would also allow them to become small business owners in an industry that has no gender pay gap and also provides flexibility for working mothers. In order to recruit more women drivers, Mateo said SheTaxis/SheRides will hold a women's opportunity job fair starting September 16 at its Long Island City offices for seven days a week from 10am to 8pm. Prepared: SheTaxi driver Dinorah De Cruz walks up to a New York Taxi and Limo Commission brokerage to collect her insurance and license paperwork yesterday afternoon . As for legal questions that have been raised as to whether a women-only car service might be discriminatory against men, Andrew Celli, an attorney for SheTaxis/SheRides, said 'We have no legal issues as far as I'm concerned.' But the city's Human Rights Commissioner, Patricia Gatling, said the agency is reminding car service companies that denying service based on gender is illegal under city law. He noted that the service, which partners with a number of established livery car firms, would not exclude male riders. Tamika Mallory, spokeswoman for SheTaxis/SheRides, has said male riders could be referred to a livery affiliate if a female driver was not available. On the road: SheTaxi driver Dinorah De Cruz gets into her car after a visit to a Taxi and Limo Commission brokerage. Currently only three per cent of New York's 115,000 taxi drivers are female, so SheTaxi - which had been scheduled for launch yesterday - was built to book only taxis driven by a woman for its users . Stella Mateo did not give a target date for the launch of the service, which will rely on an Apple app with an Android version to follow. Dinorah Decruz, 64, of East Meadow on Long Island, said the app made her decide to get back to driving after stopping about a year ago. She said she had some safety concerns and was almost robbed by a man once. She said focusing on women passengers makes her more comfortable. 'I like the idea,' she said. 'It feels safe.' Bronya Shaffer, 66, of Brooklyn, said the app is a good idea and she would encourage her daughters to use it. She likened it to being able to go to female doctors or attorneys. 'It's having one more opportunity in our whole world, in all of our interactions everywhere, to know that I can choose to have a woman if I want,' she said. 'It's kind of nice.'","SheTaxi app was intended to locate women drivers for female passengers .

"A supermarket chain has been forced to apologise after a manager suggested an 89-year-old poppy seller buy a warmer coat because there was not space for him to set up a stall to sell them inside. A shopper claimed to have found the pensioner 'freezing' outside the store in Taunton, Somerset and asked the manager why the elderly man was not selling poppies in the foyer as temperatures dipped to around 14C.

Morrisons has been forced to apologise after the manager of the branch in Taunton, Somerset suggested that an 89-year-old poppy seller buy a warmer coat because there was not space for him to  sell them inside . Ms Roach argued with the manager and claims he then told her: 'Well, he'll have to wear a warmer coat tomorrow.' In a lengthy post of Facebook, which has since gone viral, Veronica Roach described meeting the poppy seller outside the supermarket on Saturday morning. 'I took his hand, which was freezing and asked why he'd set up outside,' she wrote. 'I hunted down the manager and challenged him. He said they had their promotion at the door which meant there was no room for the poppy stand.'

The Met Office said temperatures in Taunton on Saturday morning were likely to be between 14C and 15C. The Royal British Legion confirmed the seller, a war veteran, did not want to be identified following the incident. 'The British Legion in the morning confirmed they wanted to collect outside,' Morrisons said in a statement. 'However at lunchtime their volunteer changed to an 89-year-old gentleman. This changes everything. The manager allegedly said the 89-year-old poppy seller should buy a warmer coat to face the cold . 'We can confirm that our manager did not know this and therefore his comment re 'wrap up warm' is then exceptionally inappropriate and he is very saddened by this. 'We at Morrisons are very sorry at how this misunderstanding has looked, we will of course donate to the British Legion, and will be making a special gift to both Veronica and our 89-year-old veteran. 'Veronica is a very welcome regular in the store and is known by lots of the staff and the store manager and this issue has caused concern to all of them.

'The British Legion and the store are managing this situation together and are both concerned regarding any adverse reaction towards the store. 'We can confirm that Veronica, The British Legion and Morrisons have worked together to resolve this matter and would ask you to respect their action.' A spokeswoman for the Royal British Legion said collectors had been offered positions inside and outside and had opted for the outside position because of the greater footfall. She said collections would continue there.

"Cricket's corruption crisis took a new twist on Monday when former New Zealand star Chris Cairns was alleged to be the man at the centre of the latest fixing scandal.

"A dairy has shocked its customers by telling them they need to telephone the Philippines to order their daily milk deliveries. Instead of ringing the Dairy Crest depot two miles up the road, residents of Westgate, Gloucester, have been told to contact a call centre in Manila, 7,000 miles away. Tory Councillor Pam Tracey said: 'They have sent us all a letter saying they want us to pay by direct debit, but how do we know what milk we want or don't want on a daily basis? Dairy Crest claim customers have said their delivery service has improved since outsourcing customer calls . 'And after all of these years I have decided to stop my milk being delivered. And people in the road have stopped theirs. 'Having to ring the Philippines is diabolical.' A Dairy Crest spokesman has said many customer calls were handled within depots but around 60 per cent of these were not being answered. The spokesman declined to say why the company would not hire a full-time staff member to respond to customers who phone in, but said 'we're trying to compete with all the other retailers'. Under the current arrangements, more than 90 per cent of enquiries are picked up. 'Many long time customers have said their service has improved,' the spokesman claimed. Landscape gardener from Denmark Road, Rob Bennett, said he ordered milk three times a week via direct debit. 'You can change your order the night before, I find there's no problem with it,' he said. 'It's far more cost effective but I think it's a generational thing, some are technophobes and still like to order with the milkman.' Dairy Crest has said residents who prefer to pay in cash can still do so and in most cases offers doorstep customers a choice of payment options. They can either pay the milkman directly on a prearranged day or pay online. The spokesman said: 'If they choose to pay online we ask customers to register to create an account to set up a direct debit or automatic credit card payment and there is no minimum order. 'They can change or amend an order up until 9pm the night before and when an order is amended a new bill is generated so they are not charged for milk or products they have not had. 'With regard to the customers in Henry Road, we can confirm that a new roundsman has recently taken on this area and will be contacting them to arrange a collection time.' An agent for the call centre in the Philippines, who answered a UK local phone number on Dairy Crest's website, confirmed their base was in Manilla but declined to give the name of the company. 'I'm afraid I'm not allowed do that,' the representative said. The agent said they answer Dairy Crest customer calls up to 5pm evening time in the U.K. A customer call centre representative for Dairy Crest in Manilla declined to give out the name of the company .","Residents in Gloucester need to ring 7,000 miles away with delivery queries .

"Multi-millionaire rapper Jay Z WILL be by his best pal Kanye West's side when he says 'I Do' to Kim Kardashian on Saturday, MailOnline can reveal. A close family source has confirmed the star will stand up for his friend at the lavish ceremony to be held at Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy. Rumours that Jay Z would be the best man were originally dismissed, but the family member said he would be attending alongside his wife, superstar Beyoncé, adding: 'Beyoncé had to think about it at the last minute, she didn't really want to go, but I think Jay Z's the best man, so he's kind of making her go...

The pair are seen at the 2012 BET Awards in LA, with Beyoncé and Kim Kardashian bookending them . The Italian Job: Jay-Z is bringing Beyoncé with him to Kim and Kanye's wedding - although a close family member at first said Beyoncé had reservations . Final preparations: Kim and Kanye have been busy getting ready for the arrival of their guests in Paris on Friday and were seen in the French capital today wearing matching camel-coloured outfits . Everyone has been waiting to see whether the A-list couple will turn up to the European extravaganza that kicks off in Paris on Friday and then moves on to Florence. They were said to be shying away from attending - but MailOnline understands they will now make an appearance after Kim and Kanye banned cameras for the Kardashians' E! reality show at the wedding. Instead, the preparations for the big day will be caught on camera. Kim tweeted earlier this month: 'We are not filming our wedding for Keeping Up With The Kardashians. You will see everything leading up til and after! As much as we would love to share these memories on camera, we've decided to keep this close to our heart & share thru photos.' She also disputed reports they had finalized a massive guest list, adding: 'No guest list has been released. Seeing fake ones. Especially not 1600 people invited like I just read. Its VERY small & intimate 4. Seeing fake wedding dress pics of me. No one has seen my dress! Those photos are old or photo shopped. That's it! Unless you hear it from us please don't believe nonsense!' And the family member confirmed there were just 150 guests invited to the wedding.

The pair were seen sitting together at the 2012 BET Awards in Los Angeles -with Jay Z and Kanye separating them - and Kim invited the singer to her baby shower last year on June 2. And when Kim gave birth to daughter North on June 15, Beyoncé, the mother of Blue Ivy, now two, posted a picture of Kim and Kanye looking totally in love, writing: 'Congratulations Kim and Kanye, enjoy this beautiful moment together.'

"Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has claimed that the Australian public supports a military campaign against Islamic State, as Australian fighter jets prepare to head to Iraq. Ms Bishop labelled the 'murderous terrorist organisation' as a threat not only to the Middle East but to Australia and the rest of the world, during the the United Nations Security Council in early September. 'The international community cannot with any conscience turn away,' she said. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has claimed that the Australian public supports a military campaign against Islamic State, as Australian fighter jets prepare to head to Iraq. On Saturday, the foreign minister said that sending Australian armed forces overseas 'is one of the most significant and serious decisions that any government can make,' 'We have considered it from every angle, and considered every option, and we know that Australia’s national security is at risk,' Ms Bishop told The Sunday Times in Busselton in Western Australia. 'ISIS and similar organisations are not only threatening the people of Iraq and beyond, but Australia,' she said. 'There have been a number of videos where Australia has specifically been mentioned as a terrorist target.' 'I believe the Australian people understand the threat, and support the Australian Government doing all it can to keep them safe.' The foreign minister's comment follow the revelation that Australia's super hornet fighter jets are heading to the Middle East. In the past few days F/A 18 jets were employed in non combat reconnaissance and intelligence operations in Iraq The Sunday Telegraph reported. 'We have considered it from every angle, and considered every option, and we know that Australia’s national security is at risk,' said Ms Bishop . The deployment of the Air Task Group will be the largest sent out from Australia since the Vietnam War, joining aircraft and tanker transport already operating in Iraq. The super hornet jets have returned to base in Dubai, and air strikes are anticipated to begin as early as Sunday evening. A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal government's decision to begin air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State.

A Galaxy poll revealed that 62% of Australian voters are in favour of the Federal government's decision to begin air strikes in Iraq against Islamic State. A further three quarters of voters also believe that the threat of a terrorism attack on Australian soil is real. Ms Bishop reinforced the findings of the poll as she addressed security concerns on Saturday. Security and intelligence agencies were 'concerned that a terrorist attack could take place' within Australia, said Ms Bishop. 'They are not saying that one is imminent but they are saying Australia is a target,' 'ISIS and similar organisations are opposed to open, tolerant and free societies.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin and Defence minister David Johnston . 'The Government has a plan to keep Australia safe,' said Prime Minister Tony Abbott . 'Australia represents what they oppose and they try to eliminate any opposition to their crazy and murderous ideology.' Ms Bishop encouraged Australians to continue their lives and to be 'pragmatic'. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott reassured the public that in uncertain times, the government would do 'everything possible to keep you safe,' reported The Daily Telegraph. 'Our security measures at home and abroad are directed against terrorism, not religion,' he said. 'As Australians we should always live normally because terrorists’ goal is to scare us out of being ourselves,' 'The Government has a plan to keep Australia safe.'

"A Labour council forced residents to sit through a 45-second anti-cuts message every time they rang their town hall. Derby City Council was accused of holding callers ‘hostage’ by ‘force feeding’ them with taxpayer-funded propaganda about government cuts. The monologue tells people who ring its switchboard about savings targets before they are given menu options. Everyone who phoned Derby town hall, which charges callers the local rate, was forced to listen to a 45 second message before being given menu options . It begins: ‘Due to the cuts in government funding and the rising costs of providing services, our council has to save another £60million over the next three years.’ The message then asks residents to give their views about which services should be cut, and which should be saved. The council’s number is not a freephone one, meaning callers have to pay the normal local rate charge to hear the message. Last night Bob Neill, a Conservative Party vice chairman, said: ‘This is a new low for Labour – ramming anti-Government propaganda down the throats of people while they’re held hostage on the phone. Due to the cuts in government funding and the rising costs of providing services, our council has to save another £60million over the next three years. This means we will not be able to provide all of the services we currently do. Through Derby’s Big Conversation you can influence the decisions we make about the future of council services by telling us which services are important to you, your family and your community. You can get involved by giving us your views by using our online budget simulator. ‘It’s a disgraceful misuse of hardworking taxpayers’ money, and is particularly audacious at a time when Labour leader Ed Miliband refuses to talk about the deficit and has no long-term economic plan for the country. ‘The truth is, Labour’s policies that got us into a financial mess in the first place, and under their watch British people and their families would be much less secure.’ Derby’s anti-cuts message was broadcast to anyone who rang up the council with a query or complaint about a service. Following complaints, an option to skip it was installed on Monday night. The council is expecting to shed another 350 posts on top of the 1,200 lost since 2010. Band D council taxpayers in Derby pay £1,404.50 a year – slightly below the national average of £1,456. Matthew Holmes, the council’s deputy Conservative leader, said: ‘I very much doubt that residents calling the council to have something important dealt with or to ask for advice will be happy to be force fed an anti-government message, nor be pleased at the delay in being able to speak to an adviser. ‘It’s completely the wrong way to deal with customers who are likely to be quite angry when they are eventually put through to a member of staff due to the message. ‘The customer is also paying for the phone call, which is being artificially extended with what a majority see as propaganda.’ Last year another Labour council, Lambeth in south London, was accused of using taxpayers’ money to fund anti-government posters complaining about the effect of cuts. One of the 50 posters even warned benefits claimants that cuts mean they ‘may have to find work’. Derby Council (town hall pictured) refused to apologise for the message, which was branded 'propaganda' by critics, saying the information was factually accurate . In Derby, Labour refused to apologise for its message. Martin Rawson, deputy leader of the council, said the recording was ‘a statement of fact’. ‘It was a collective decision by the [Labour] leadership to put the message on there because we feel it is important for the people of Derby to tell us what… they think about the cuts,’ he told the BBC. ‘The council is facing unprecedented cuts to its budget both now and in the future, which is why we’re inviting everyone to take part in the Big Conversation – to give Derby people a say on how we balance the budget. ‘A message was added for incoming callers to the council to maximise our engagement through the Big Conversation. ‘By using as many channels as we have available, such as phone messages, our website, e-shots and social media, it enables as many people as possible to tell us their thoughts. ‘Ultimately, this is about driving people to the [online] budget simulator and encouraging them to share their views to enable decisions to be based on the feedback of the public.’","Derby City Council played message to everyone who called the town hall .

Jordon Moody, 22, lost part of her left leg to bone cancer. She now has her left foot in the place of her knee, but rotated 180 degrees. This leaves her toes twisted backwards and her heel at the front, creating the  most natural 'downwards' angle to how a normal knee bends, ready for a prosthetic to be attached . She needed the radical surgery after her bone cancer returned for the second time. She underwent the op at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham in July and is now adapting to life with her new limb . Miss Moody needed the operation after being diagnosed with bone cancer for a second time. She had been studying performing arts in New York when doctors first discovered she had the disease in her thigh. She stayed in America for the next year, undergoing chemotherapy and an operation to remove the tumour. After being given the all-clear, she returned to England to the home she shared with her parents and two sisters. But during a visit to her godmother in Germany last year, she suffered excruciating pain and was rushed to hospital.

She is now waiting to be fitted with a new artificial lower limb, which will be attached to the joint created from her foot. She flew back to England and was taken to St James's Hospital in Leeds for more tests where doctors confirmed the cancer had returned and she was facing the amputation of her leg. The 22-year-old said: 'The pain was worse than ever and I just couldn't move it. 'It was so scary, especially in light of the fact that the more times you get cancer, the less likely chemotherapy is going to work. 'In all honesty, you just have the fear that you are going to die. 'It's there in the back of your mind all the time.' Doctors then told her she could either have a leg completely amputated or undergo the rotationplasty.

'They told me they could get rid of my thigh and use the bottom part of my leg to replace the top part and my foot would become my knee. 'They would have to turn it 180 degrees because of the way the foot bends so it would bend the same way as a knee. 'It was really hard to hear. 'When they told me I had an option to keep my leg, this wasn't what I wanted to hear.' Miss Moody said: 'It seemed like I would have a better quality of life as I could have a prosthesis fitted. 'I have been on crutches since I had the first operation so it's been a couple of years now. It is hoped Miss Moody will be walking unaided again before Christmas . 'That's my main way of getting around and I use a wheelchair. 'Hopefully, before Christmas, I will be walking unaided again.' She added: 'I've always been independent and I hate to feel dependent when I'm in a wheelchair or having to use the walking aids. 'There's not so much going out now but I will be able to walk unaided if I get a prosthesis so that's my aim now. That's my goal.' Mr Lee Jeys, an orthopedic oncology surgeon at the Royal Orthopedic Hospital, Birmingham, carried out Miss Moody's procedure. He said: 'Jordon had already had treatment in America for a thigh tumour and unfortunately we needed to remove the whole of her thigh bone. 'Instead of leaving her without a leg, we connected her shin bone to the remaining thigh bone, creating a knee joint from her foot. 'The idea of the operation is where we turn the foot around and move it up, so Jordon could have a below the knee prosthesis. 'Otherwise she would have had to have an amputation and would have been left with no leg at all. 'It is very technical surgery and I perform it about three a year- usually on young patients. 'The aim of the surgery is so the patients can walk, and in clothes will look completely normal. 'Of course, out of clothes it looks a little unusual but we do it to offer patients the best functionality they can. Most patients will eventually be able to walk unaided.'

The 22-year-old's lower leg was then moved up in the place of her thigh .
Now has a new knee joint made using the foot from her left leg .
This has been rotated to 180 degrees, leaving her heel at the front .
This provides a natural angle most similar to how a normal knee bends .
