"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . British motorists have been warned to expect an increase in petrol prices after Saudi Arabia and Iran say recent falls are set to be reversed. The price of fuel at pumps fell to a three-year low, according to figures released by the AA last week and drivers were hopeful that the decline would continue. But Iran’s Petroleum Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh has said that the downward trend in Brent crude oil prices falling to $103 per barrel will be short lived. Middle Eastern oil superpowers have warned that petrol prices could increase after falling to three-year-low . ‘The decline in crude prices is due to seasonal fluctuations and will not last,’ he told Iranian oil ministry news service Shana today. It comes after the chief executive of Saudi Aramco – the world’s largest state-owned oil company – Khalid al-Falih advised that in order to sustain enough investment in the future, prices would have to remain at the current level. ‘To tap these increasingly expensive oil resources, oil prices will need to be healthy enough to attract needed investments,’ al-Falih was quoted as saying at an industry conference by Reuters in The Telegraph. ‘To meet forecast demand growth and offset decline, our industry will need to add close to 40 million barrels per day (bpd) of new capacity in the next two decades.’ Iran’s Petroleum Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh has said that the downward trend will be short lived . Out of the 12-member Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Iran and Saudi Arabia have the largest proven oil reserves. According to a report by global bank Citigroup, the ‘oil intensity’ of global gross domestic product has halved in the last 30 years. It also maintains that since 2007, petrol demand in the OECD rich states has been falling from 15.5 million barrels per day of crude oil to 14 million barrels per day. And despite conflicts in Iraq and Ukraine, prices have remained ‘soft’. Mr Zanganeh added: ‘These events and the presence of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) in this country [Iraq] will not significantly affect the international oil market.’ Despite the recent fall in petrol prices – which saw petrol drop to an average price of 129.18p per litre and 133.55p per litre for diesel – the UK is said to be lagging behind most of Europe. AA public affairs head Paul Watters said last week: 'Drivers on the Continent have been enjoying these lower prices sooner. Despite the UK fuel industry's claim to sell the cheapest petrol in Europe before tax, new EU figures show that fierce competition from fuel-price regulation drove Austrian pre-tax prices even lower.’","Price of fuel at pumps fell to a three-year low, figures revealed last week .

"By . Australian Associated Press . The mother of a disabled man is pleading for serial rapist Patrick Comeagain to be moved from a small block of units where her son and other vulnerable people live. Comeagain was seen breaking into dance when he was released from a West Australian prison in June on a strict supervision order that included curfews and electronic monitoring. The Department of Corrective Services was forced to relocate Comeagain from a wheatbelt town to another town in Western Australia within days of him moving there over concerns for his safety, following an outcry from the community. Rebecca - not her real name - told Fairfax radio on Tuesday that Comeagain was living next to her son, who has a severe brain injury from a motor vehicle accident. Scroll down for video . The mother of a disabled man is pleading for sex offender Patrick Alfred Dennis Comeagain to be relocated, claiming he is living in an area where a large number of vulnerable people reside . Women, children and young men with mental illnesses also lived at the Department of Housing units, which were close to shops and a childcare centre, Rebecca said. Residents were not told Comeagain was living next to them and only found out when a neighbour recognised him from the news. 'We were all very, very concerned,' Rebecca said. 'One of the tenants is afraid to leave her unit.' Rebecca said authorities responsible for Comeagain initially denied he was living there and only admitted it when she persisted with her complaint. She said Comeagain had to live somewhere but needed to be moved to more appropriate housing. 'It's almost a time bomb waiting to go off,' she said. Comeagain has spent 14 years in prison, including time for raping a nine-year-old girl and two women . Comeagain was handed an indefinite detention order in October 2008 after spending most of his adult life - 14 years -  in prison and claims to have sexually assaulted 41 people, including men, women and children. He had five episodes of serious sexual offending, starting in 1987 when he was 15. The victims were generally adult women, but five offences in 1994 were committed against a nine-year-old girl. He raped a woman five weeks after being released on parole and 37 days after that he raped another woman in her home. Comeagain was fined $1000 in August after he breached a condition of his supervision order that prohibited him from coming into contact with children. The 41-year-old was released from prison in June on a strict supervision order that included curfews and electronic monitoring . The offence occurred when Comeagain attended a family gathering where children were present. A WA Department of Corrective Services spokesman said the sex offender management squad continued to supervise Comeagain. He said Comeagain's address and location was suppressed by the court and therefore could not be communicated to third parties. Comeagain could be returned to custody if he breached a condition of his supervision order, the spokesman said. The 41-year-old's release into the community includes a strict 10-year supervision order on the man - requiring him to wear a GPS tracker, comply to a strict curfew and not to have contact with a child under the age of 16. In previous annual reviews of his dangerous sex offender status, it has been noted there had been very few occasions following his release from prison when Comeagain had not re-offended shortly after.","Residents are pleading for Patrick Alfred Dennis Comeagain to be moved from the block of units where they live .

"By . Associated Press . The four men killed in a fiery plane crash in Ohio were students at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, including three members of the varsity wrestling team, school officials said Tuesday. The three wrestlers were identified as 20-year-old Lucas Marcelli of Massillon, Ohio, 18-year-old Abraham Pishevar of Rockville, Maryland, and 18-year-old John Hill of St. Simons, Georgia. The 20-year-old pilot, William Felten of Saginaw, Michigan, also was killed. University officials said Felten and Marcelli were second-year students, while Hill and Pishevar were freshmen.

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . Wayne Rooney might have proposed on a garage forecourt but with 75 per cent of women saying they were unhappy with the way they got engaged, it seems more effort is needed. One woman who certainly subscribes to the make an effort school of thought is Daisy Amodio, 32, from Hertfordshire who has turned popping the question into a lucrative business. The proposals organised by her firm, The Proposers, range from simple musical serenades to lavish designer shopping splurges followed by a helicopter ride to a country church for the big moment. Popping the question: Daisy Amodio, 32, spends her days organising other people's perfect proposals . 'It all started when we spotted a man in Hyde Park one evening who was trying to spell ""make me the happiest man alive"" but who had spelled happiness wrong,' explains Amodio. 'He proceeded to . tell us that he was planning to propose in five minutes time and we were so . excited that we offered to hide and take pictures of the happy . moment. 'Needless to say, we captured the yes and so The Proposers was born.' Since that moment just over two years ago, Amodio, a petite blonde in skyscraper heels, has gone on to orchestrate hundreds more proposals, some restrained and others endearingly wacky. Popular choices include flash mobs, musical serenades and champagne picnics, while others involve splashing out on helicopters, super-cars and even, in one case, recreating the wedding scene from Love Actually. Surprise! A girl is surprised by her boyfriend (and a flash mob) in the middle of Covent Garden . Romantic: This proposal was set up in an art gallery and included a personalised painting . But while Amodio says she and her team can pull off most of her clients' more outlandish ideas, some are beyond even her network of contacts. 'One of the wackiest proposal requests we’ve received was from a guy who honestly thought we could arrange for the Queen to be at his proposal,' she chuckles. 'We politely told him that unless we hired a lookalike, there was absolutely no way the Queen would come to his proposal. He didn’t call us back.' Others have asked for all-action affairs, with the result that Amodio and her team have had to gird their loins and get to grips with everything from abseiling to skiing and even scuba diving. It all sounds fairly intense - even more so when Amodio reveals that some of the most simple seeming proposals can turn out to be among the most challenging. 'We recently got asked to help with a proposal at Barafundle Beach in Wales,' she explains, 'which was once voted the best beach in the world. 'It was to be sunset proposal surrounded with love notes, fairy lights, candles, cushions and rugs and so on but when we arrived, the beach was nowhere to be seen.' Popular: Like this beach proposal, romantic champagne picnics are a popular choice with would-be grooms . Venue: Venues include private beaches, churches and in this case, an art gallery . Instead, laden with candles, cushions and champagne, Amodio had to spend half an hour hiking along the clifftop before navigating a tricky descent down 100 steep steps. Struggling to light the candles in the face of bitter sea winds, matters grew worse when, unbeknown to Amodio, who had no phone signal on the secluded beach, the client arrived early. 'Luckily enough, we spotted them in the distance and hid,' she chuckles, 'and the proposal went without a hitch. 'It then dawned on us that we would have to pack everything up at midnight and then hike back along the cliff in the dark. 'Let’s just say that it was a horrendous walk back but it was all in the name of a couple getting a gorgeous proposal.' Happily, not all involve candles and cliff top treks. Others have included unique artwork and rose petals, while more still were traditional with a twist - among them, Amodio's own. 'I’m more of a private person and always . said that I’d love to turn the lock on our front door to find something going on inside,' she smiles. 'Well one day I did turn that lock and was surprised by a trail of rose petals and candles leading to the roof terrace . door. 'The door had a huge sign on it that said, ""Is this how you . pictured your future?"" and I opened it to find him . surrounded by thousands of lanterns, candles and flowers. 'He had my . ring made for me . and even booked a nail appointment because he knew I’d want to show my . ring off. It was certainly how I pictured my future.' And Amodio isn't the only woman looking for something special from a proposal. 'Times have changed,' she explains. Splashing out: Grooms with cash to splash can ask Daisy (pictured left) to charter a private helicopter . No luck: One client asked Daisy to invite the Queen to his proposal - unfortunately, she had to say no . 'In 2014, couples want . more of a story. It doesn’t need to cost the earth but it does need to be thoughtful and personalised.' This is where Amodio and The Proposers come in, offering unique proposals that cost between £500 and £50,000. 'Everybody has a different opinion on proposals but I think it should whatever you want it to be,' she continues. 'If you want to declare it to the world via a dancing flash mob in Covent Garden then that’s amazing but if you’d prefer to keep it private and simple then that’s fabulous too. 'Some people want a great story to . remember and tell everyone and some people wouldn’t care if it was in a . car park – everyone’s different,' she adds. 'The men we deal with are . usually extremely romantic and just want to make sure they propose in the very best way.'","Daisy Amodio, 32, from Hertfordshire founded The Proposers in 2011 .

While she and three other monkeys were recovered by police, her offspring was never found. Mamma cuddles up with her new born twins which have yet to be named or sexed at Blackpool Zoo . But more than a year later, the monkey has given birth to healthy twins. A Blackpool Zookeeper confirmed the babies were born on August 1 and were doing well. 'The two new babies, who are yet to be sexed and named, are doing extremely well and we are delighted for them. 'The pair are also vital for the international breeding programme, so it is great news all round,' said Charlotte Pennie, Senior Primate Keeper. 'Keepers at Blackpool Zoo were devastated earlier this year when five of our monkeys were stolen, as every single animal we have here is considered a member of our zoo family.' 'We worked very closely with Lancashire Police and following huge media interest four of the five were found days later,' she added. The monkeys were snatched from their enclosures last April after thieves cut through fencing. Mamma was stolen alongside four other monkeys, including her baby, by gangsters last April . The Cotton-top Tamarin was found three days after being stolen in a cardboard box in west Yorkshire . Lancashire Police believed they were targeted to be sold onto the black market as pets for wealthy buyers, it was claimed. The cotton-top tamarin is a small New World monkey weighing less than 0.5 kg. One of the smallest primates, it is easily identified by the long white sagittal crest extending from its forehead to its shoulders. Up to 40,000 cotton-top tamarins were caught and exported for use in biomedical research before 1976 when they were given the highest level of protection and all international trade was banned. The wild population is estimated at 6,000 individuals, with 2,000 adults, with the species listed in among the World's 25 Most Endangered Primates in 2012. Experts say small monkeys like tamarins and macaques are becoming an increasingly popular pet in the US despite a ban by several states ban on owning a primate. Justin Bieber had a pet capuchin for a while, but left the animal in Germany after failing to provide sufficient vetting documents to authorities at Munich Airport . They were discovered in a cardboard box in west Yorkshire days later, but Mamma's missing baby has never been found. Keepers feared Mamma not recover from the shock of losing her offspring after showing signs of sadness. But tests later showed the rare animal was in the early stages of pregnancy at the time of the traumatic theft. After returning to the zoo, the rescued were kept separated from other primates in case they didn't recognise them and attacked them. At the time Miss Pennie said: 'That was a serious concern but with the speedy return we got them back in time and managed to reintegrate them well. 'The female was very quiet when she first came back - that may have been the stress as well as the fact she was missing her baby. 'They had a few marks on them but otherwise they came back healthy. We were all so happy to get them back - to be honest to get any of them back was brilliant. 'But the baby was so dependent on its mother, I think we have come to the conclusion we are not going to see that one again.' Police who worked with the National Wildlife Crime Unit to trace the monkeys say investigations into the burglary are ongoing. The 15-month-old animal hasn't let her new twin offspring out of her sight since welcoming them three weeks ago .

"By . Jonny Singer . It's a feeling every Sunday League footballer knows - you watch a Premier League game and think 'I'm better than some of those players'. Well now amateurs in the third tier of the Sunderland Sunday League have the chance to prove it, as they go up against former Sunderland and Middlesbrough midfielder Julio Arca. Arca, 33, made his debut last weekend for The Willow Pond FC, scoring in a 2-2 draw against Hylton Road Carpets Elite. Big signing: The former professional made his debut for the Sunday League team last weekend . Experience: Arca played for Middlesbrough for seven years after six seasons with Sunderland . The Argentine ex-pro, who played twice for his country at U-20 level, retired from professional football in 2013 after over a decade playing in the North East, making more than 300 league appearances. But he told the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette that after his retirement he missed the game, so he has started playing for fun. 'My routine changed a great deal when I stopped,' he said. 'Playing professionally is not something you forget in one day. I miss it. 'The lads asked me a couple of years ago if I would play for them when I retired and I always said I would. Quality: The midfielder says it will take time for his new team to adapt to his playing style . The midfielder enjoyed his debut, and the post-match drinks, but says it will take some time for his new teammates to adapt to his game. 'Playing is great for me, it gets me out of the house. And I also enjoy a couple of drinks with the lads after the match.' 'It will take me a little while to get into it. The lads will also need a little time to get used to the way I play.' In the meantime, it's a great chance for the sunday footballers of Sunderland to get one over on their former hero.

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . An Australian company with a revolutionary new building system has promised they can build their customers' dream homes from scratch in as little as six weeks' time with a revolutionary new panelling system. Putting together an individually designed three bedroom, two bathroom, single story home under the new system will not only take a quarter of the time it usually takes to build a house, but also cuts both the costs of labour and everyday living, NU-TEK Building Systems' directors claim. The time-saving and cost-cutting technology, designed by the privately-owned South Australian company, involves an instant structural panel wall system which makes up the home's frame, doing away with timber frames or brick veneer walls. NU-TEK Building Systems in South Australia have designed a new panel system which significantly reduces the time and costs involved in building a new home from scratch . The company claims an individually designed three bedroom, two bathroom, single story home takes only six weeks to put together . NU-TEK's website explains that a 'steel structural edge beam [is] embedded in the edges of the panel' which allows them to fit together with other panels. Each panel is also fitted with 100mm of PIR Foam and use a Magnesium Oxide composite, providing fire and termite resistance as well as acoustic and weather insulation. NU-TEK marketing director Greg Toop, told the Advertiser that the technology will revolutionise the building industry and that he expects the business to boom into a $100 million a year industry within the next couple of years. The revolutionary panels are fitted with steel structural edge beams which allows them to fit together . The specially designed foam core provides fire and termite resistance as well as acoustic and weather insulation . 'It offers a new future for building in Australia, it's a reality, this is the future,' Mr Toop said. 'We started concentrating on houses, but we've found people want to use the product for a wide range of uses and so we believe there is no limit to the potential,' he said. The design flexibility that is available for customers is part of the system's whole appeal. Not only are the panels available in any length, but buyers can choose any building material for each side of the panels – colour bond, cement board, wood, stainless steel and so on - with the option of having entirely different choices for the interior and exterior facing sides. The panels also have flexible design options, with buyers able to choose the length and building materials of each side . Private housing and agricultural industries have both expressed their interest in the company's design . This has led to a spike of interest from a variety of industries in the privately owned company, which has been the developing the panels for the last four years, according to the Advertiser. Private housing and agricultural industries have so far contacted the company with requests and ideas. NU-TEK's website states that their demonstration homes have been assessed as having a 7.6 Green Star rating.","NU-TEK Building Systems in South Australia have designed a new panel system that makes up the frame of a house .

"By . Mail online Reporter . An 88-year-old woman was attacked by a rabid raccoon Sunday night when she went to let her cat into the house. The Hamden, Conn., woman, identified only by her first name, Betty, said the animal followed her cat into her Brinsmade Road house before she could shut the door on it. 'The thing about it that was so frightening was it's awful strength,' she told reporters. 'When it jumped on me it was on me and I'm pulling on it and everything else, the thing was terribly alive and terribly strong.' Betty, who asked her face not be shown as she's healing, was attacked by a rabid raccoon Sunday when she let her cat into the house . Betty, 88, said the animal ran into her home following her house cat, who has since disappeared . Fox CT reports Animal Control found the raccoon had rabies after testing it at the Connecticut Public Health Lab. The disease, which attacks the central nervous system, can be fatal without proper treatment. Early symptoms include fever, fatigue, and headaches before the most well known foaming at the mouth, which does not appear until rabies has progressed to its advanced stages. The animal bit Betty on her elbow, hand, forearm, and face while she struggled to subdue it. 'She is 88 and she is stronger than I thought she was,' son Rory McKernan told Fox CT. Police euthanized the animal at the scene. McKernan said the house was left a disaster as his mother struggled to keep the raccoon at bay. 'My brother kept saying it looks like a crime scene on TV, there were . splatters, hand prints, puddles and things like that,' he said. They've since scrubbed through the living room with bleach and thrown the couch cushions in the trash. Police euthanized the animal on scene and it later tested positive for rabies . Betty's cat remains missing, having fled during the attack. Before being informed of the rabies, Betty told news crews that once she healed she expected life to go on as normal. 'Oh I’ll be alright it just takes time for various things to heal and then I’ll go back out and walk the garden path again.' she said.","Betty, 88, of Hamden, said the raccoon bit her on the arms and face during its attack .

'Back when we were thinking about making the business we were playing around with doughnuts and we decided to try to make something savoury. 'It's been trial and error.

"By . Associated Press . A New York City teenager who admitted smoking marijuana and speeding before crashing into a tree in 2012, killing four of his friends on Long Island, was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison on Tuesday. The judge decided against a four-year youthful offender sentence for Joseph Beer, who was 17 at the time of the crash. Beer, now 19, of Queens, pleaded guilty in July to the top count of aggravated vehicular homicide in the fiery crash on the Southern State Parkway. A month earlier, a jury had deadlocked on the charge, but Beer decided to plead guilty to spare the families of his friends who died the ordeal of a second trial, his attorney said. PRISON: Joseph Beer was sentenced to five to 15 years in prison for the 2012 crash that killed four of his friends . Horror crash: This is what Beer's car looked like after Beer lost control of the vehicle and hit a tree in Long Island . Beer also pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of marijuana. Defense attorney Todd Greenberg has argued that unlike blood-alcohol standards for drunken driving, police and prosecutors have yet to develop a reliable measurement for impairment from marijuana. An expert testified that because Beer was a chronic marijuana smoker, his body's ability to process the active ingredient in marijuana may be different from someone who is an occasional user. 'We never denied that there was some responsibility,' Greenberg said during the trial. But the defense 'always maintained that Joseph Beer was not impaired, and the impairment by marijuana did not cause this accident,' he added. Prosecutors said Beer was driving faster than 100 mph when he smashed into a tree on a stretch of highway dubbed Dead Man's Curve because of a treacherous hill that leads to a sharp curve. The spectacular crash at about 4 a.m. on the Columbus Day holiday in October 2012 cut the high-performance Subaru in half, killing the four boys instantly.

Beer was the lone survivor and had only minor injuries. Bryant Barr, stepfather of victim Peter Kanhai, said after the sentencing that it was 'a tragedy on both sides,' including for Beer's family. Barr said his family 'can find forgiveness in our heart' even though Beer exhibited 'a lack of remorse.' 'This is a learning experience for other people out there that consequences will follow for the act that you do,' said Barr, adding that he hopes Beer will 'be able to do something better with his life' after prison.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 10:55 GMT, 22 July 2011 . Hero of the far-Right: Rudolf Hess, whose remains have been removed from his grave, cremated and scattered . The grave of Adolf Hitler’s deputy has been dismantled to stop  neo-Nazis using it as a pilgrimage point. Rudolf Hess’s remains were exhumed from the burial plot in a cemetery in the Bavarian town of Wunsiedel. They will be cremated and scattered at sea in a secret operation. Hess, pictured, who was one of Hitler’s closest aides, committed suicide in 1987 while serving a life sentence in Berlin for crimes against peace. He was 93. He had requested in his will to be buried in his family’s plot in Wunsiedel. But in recent years he has come to be seen as a martyr by the far-Right and thousands of neo-Nazis have used the anniversary of his death on August 17 as an occasion to hold rallies in the town. Despite  these being outlawed six years ago, the site and town continued to attract extremists. Hess was an early confidant of Hitler, who dictated much of his infamous manifesto Mein Kampf to him while imprisoned during the 1920s. He eventually rose to become deputy Nazi party leader, and was captured in 1941 during a solo flight to Scotland on an apparently unauthorised peace mission. Gone without a trace: Rudolf Hess's headstone is no longer to be seen in Wunsiedel, close to Bayreuth on the Czech border . Born to a wealthy Bavarian family, Hess spent his first 14 years in Egypt before going to Germany to finish his education and begin a career as a merchant. At the outbreak of the First World War, Hess enlisted in the German infantry. He was wounded on several occasions and was awarded the Iron Cross, second class, for his exploits. Hess first heard Adolf Hitler speak at a Munich rally in 1920. He became devoted to Hitler and joined the fledgling Nazi Party as one of its first members. After Hitler assumed dictatorial powers in early 1933, Hess was named 'Deputy to the Fuhrer'. On 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, Hitler announced that should anything happen to both him and Hermann Göring, Hess would be next in the line of succession. Like Goebbels, Hess was privately distressed by the war with Britain because he had hoped it would accept Germany as an ally. On May 10, 1941, Hess took off from Augsburg in a Messerschmitt Bf 110. After reaching the west coast of England he turned east before climbing and parachuting over Renfrewshire and he landed at Floors Farm near Eaglesham. Winston Churchill initially sent Hess to the Tower of London, making him the last prisoner to be held in the 900-year-old fortress. Hess was detained by the British for the remainder of the war. After the end of the war, Hess was tried at Nuremberg alongside other Nazi leaders. He was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against peace but told the tribunal, 'I regret nothing.' Following the release in 1966 of Baldur von Schirach and Albert Speer, Hess was the sole remaining inmate of Spandau Prison, partly at the insistence of the Soviets. On 17 August 1987, Hess died at the age of 93. He was found in a summer house in a garden located in a secure area of the prison with an electrical cord wrapped around his neck. His death was controversially ruled a suicide by asphyxiation. Spandau Prison was subsequently demolished to prevent it from becoming a shrine. Hess was the last surviving member of Hitler's cabinet. He was later convicted in the Nuremberg trials after the Second World War ended. His relatives and the Lutheran church which runs the cemetery agreed it was best to remove his  remains from the site. ‘The grave is now empty,’ cemetery administrator Andreas Fabel confirmed yesterday. Holocaust survivors welcomed the move. ‘There is now one less place of . evil in the world,’ said Elan Steinberg of the New  York-based American . Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and their Descendants. German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung said the descendants of Hess were . initially against the idea of exhuming his body. A granddaughter of Hess even filed . a law suit to prevent it. But the family eventually caved in to pressure from the local authorities and agreed to have his remains taken away. However, according to Fabel, with the lease on the burial plot . coming up for renewal in October, Hess’s relatives and Lutheran church . authorities in the town decided it was best to remove the remains. 'Both sides were in favour of it,' he added. Hess was an early confidant of Hitler, and, while Hitler was imprisoned in the 1920s, the Nazi leader dictated much of his infamous manifesto Mein Kampf, or My Struggle, to him. Hess eventually rose to the position of deputy Nazi party leader, but by 1941 his influence with Hitler was waning. His flight to Scotland is widely seen by historians as an attempt to restore his importance. Instead, Hitler said he was delusional and the British treated him as a prisoner of war. The Fuhrer then sacked Hess and ordered him to be shot if he ever returned to Germany. He appointed Martin Boorman as his new deputy. At the Nuremberg trials after the war, Hess was found innocent of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against peace and conspiracy to commit crimes against peace. Hess was the last inmate at Spandau Prison in then-West Berlin when he died on August 17, 1987 at the age of 93. Allied authorities said he hanged himself with an electrical cord. The prison was demolished shortly afterwards and the rubble secretly disposed of. Many far-Right groups say Hess did not commit suicide but was killed by British military guards in prison, and conspiracy theories about the Nazi, who was interested in the occult, abound.

We just don't know what his involvement is until he comes forward,' Inspector Kemp said. Mr Smith is reportedly an ex-prison convict who served time for armed robberies, according to News Corp. 'Anyone who may have information about his whereabouts is urged not to approach him but to instead contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or Dutton Park CIB on 3028 8150,' a police statement said. Another post on Ms Mari's Facebook page on August 15 read: 'A man who hits a woman is not a man'. On Tuesday police released this photo of Jacob Michael Smith, 38 . Clearly devoted to her family, Ms Mari's Facebook page is filled with images of her children and shared parenting tips. 'The girls are most concerned, they are getting counselling,' Detective Inspector Rod Kemp said. 'It's horrendous. It's their mother. Absolutely horrendous,' he added. Police believe a man in his thirties, thought to be a friend of Ms Mari, came to the house at around 2am. Police said no weapon was used and Ms Mari's flatmates, who are giving statements, didn't hear anything. An autopsy will be conducted on Wednesday to determine the cause of death. Police and paramedics were called to the house at 3:30am in Brisbane's south east after she was found dead . Two of Ms Mari's daughters, aged 11 and 12,  were at home at the time and were dressed in forensic clothes as they were led from the property . He said police are looking at previous relationships but have 'no idea what sparked it' at the moment. One of Ms Mari's male flatmates spoke to the man as he was leaving. 'They saw this person leave and then one of the person's has then checked on the deceased,' he said. 'He is known to the person, he has been there before.' 'We don't know if it's a relationship,' he added. Police are appealing for anyone who saw anything in the street or at the nearby Norman Park railway station to come forward. They believe the man may have fled from the scene by car or train. Ms Mari, who rented the home she was found dead at, also has a 15-year-old daughter who lives with her grandmother as well as a three-year-old son.

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . The former boyfriend of a young mother stabbed her to death during a row over her son's christening and then went out drinking, before returning and sleeping in the same house. Liam King 26, from Eccles, in Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to the murder of ex-girlfriend Rebecca Ayres, 25, at Manchester Crown Court today and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He will serve a minimum of 15 years before he is considered for parole. Liam King, 26, was sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering his ex-girlfriend, Rebecca Ayres, 25 . The murder took place on March 5 at the couple's shared flat in Eccles, Great Manchester, after their 18 month relationship turned sour because of his jealously . King carried out a brutal attack on his partner following an argument about whether he would be attending her son's christening a few days later . The murder took place on March 5 after the couple's 18 month relationship turned sour because of his jealously. During an argument about the ceremony of her son, Riley, King stabbed Miss Ayres to death at their shared house in Eccles, Greater Manchester, in a frenzied attack. Police were called the next day at about 9.15am after her father reportedly raised the alarm when he could get no response from the property. Neighbours also reported hearing screams and shouts coming from the house. King only fled when he heard her father knocking on the door. The post-mortem examination revealed Miss Ayres died as a result of multiple stab wounds sustained during the attack. On the day she was killed, Miss Ayres had been at the Dutton Arms pub in Eccles with her father to watch a football game, when King entered and shouted abuse at her before leaving again. King went out drinking as Miss Ayres lay dying on the floor at their shared house in Eccles, Greater Manchester . King pleaded guilty to his ex-girlfriend's murder at Manchester Crown Court today and will serve a minimum of 15 years before he is considered for parole . Miss Ayres explained to her father that she and King had split up hours earlier, although she insisted she did not understand why he was acting so aggressively towards her. After the game, Miss Ayres and her father walked to an address on Holt Street, Eccles, where she met a friend. Her friend told her that should King become aggressive when she returned home, she was to come back to her house for refuge. But that was the last time Miss Ayres was seen alive by anyone other than King. When arrested, King admitted during interview that later that night he became involved in a domestic argument - then stabbed her several times in the chest and arms. He said that he left Rebecca struggling for breath on the floor and when he returned shortly afterwards she had died. He then spent the night at the address and only fled when he heard her father knocking on the door the next morning. After the case, Senior Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Liam King's actions have left a three-year-old little boy without a mother, parents without a daughter and a family and group of friends without a young woman that lived life with a smile on her face and brought joy to those she knew. 'The police investigation revealed that Liam King was very controlling and abusive towards Rebecca. 'This is another terrible reminder of how important it is that the victims of domestic abuse, or their friends and family members if they suspect someone is a victim, should come forward and report it to the police.' King admitted that he left Rebecca struggling for breath on the floor and when he returned later she had died . Sacha Cooper, Senior Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West said: 'Liam King carried out a brutal attack with a knife on his partner of two years following an argument about whether he would be attending her son's christening a few days later. 'After the attack King made no effort to call emergency services, instead he left her body in the house and went out drinking. 'Rebecca's concerned father called the police the following morning when he was not able to make contact with her, but tragically by this time it was too late. 'Liam King's callous and cowardly actions have left a young child without a mother and parents without their daughter. 'I would like to offer my condolences to Rebecca Ayres' family and friends, my thoughts are very much with them at this time. 'The CPS are dedicated to tackling domestic violence, which is a blight on our communities. We will continue to work with the police and other agencies to provide the best possible service to victims, and bring to justice those who commit such abhorrent offences.' In an emotional tribute Miss Ayres' family described her as a 'doting mum'. She had worked as a clerk for a life assurance company and was  a member of The Monaco Morris Dancing troupe which performed at seaside holiday camps and other venues. 'Becks was our hard-working, ambitious and fun-loving princess who lived life to the full,' they said. 'She had a smile that would light up any room and the hearts of everyone she came into contact with. 'She was a special daughter, granddaughter, sister, cousin, aunty and friend to many. She was a doting mum to her three-year-old son, who was her life. 'This has had a devastating impact on us all, including the community in which she lived, especially the Monaco Morris Dancing Troupe, of which she was a member from a very early age.'","Liam King 26, from Eccles, in Greater Manchester murdered his ex-girlfriend Rebecca Ayres, 25, during a row over her son's christening .

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . Britain may need to introduce controversial privacy laws to meet the ‘challenges’ thrown up by lightning-fast internet communications, Britain’s most senior judge has said. Lord Neuberger, who is the president of the Supreme Court, said it was time to re-think the law because information spread quickly around the globe via social media including Facebook and Twitter. His comments were interpreted as a first step towards legislating to protect people’s privacy – which critics warn would hinder the Press’s ability to investigate and expose corruption and wrong-doing. Lord Neuberger, , pictured, said the speed of new technology means we may need  to consider a privacy law . Britain has no single privacy law, unlike many other European countries. But UK judges have been accused of introducing a privacy law never debated or considered by Parliament, based only on the Human Rights Act – which contains a ‘right to private and family life’ – and their own successive judgments. The process began when law lords ruled it was wrong for a newspaper to have pictured model Naomi Campbell going to a drug rehabilitation clinic. In a speech in Hong Kong, Lord Neuberger said there had been ‘astonishing developments in IT – the ease with which information can be transmitted and received across the world, the ease with which words and scenes can be clandestinely recorded, and the ease with which information can be misrepresented or doctored.’ Media lawyer Mark Stephens said a privacy law enables 'scallywags and scoundrels' to hide their wrongdoing . He said: ‘These developments may make it inevitable that the law on privacy, indeed, the law relating to communications generally, may have to be reconsidered.’ He also gave a new interpretation on the ‘law on privacy’ in England and Wales, saying: ‘If I want to do or say something which I am only prepared to do or say privately, then it is an interference with my freedom of expression, if I cannot do it or say it because it will be reported in a newspaper.’ But Mark Stephens, a leading media lawyer, said Lord Neuberger’s intervention could be the first step towards a new privacy law in this country. He said: ’I think we can say without fear of contradiction that this is a first indication of new government policy on privacy. ‘This is very controversial. There is always a debate about whether scallywags and scoundrels use privacy laws to conceal their wrongdoing.’","Lord Neuberger warned that there had been 'astonishing developments' in IT .

An outside contractor at the Oklahoma Army National Guard base was testing the safety system when the foam was accidentally triggered. The result was a hangar brimming with the frothy white chemical and and ten high tech helicopters looking like a freak summer snow storm had blown through Tulsa.

Seven of them were outside the hangar, where pictures show foam had poured from inside where the system was triggered. Those Black Hawks, however, had their cockpits closed and were completely untouched save for their sturdy exteriors. Inside, however, three more choppers were parked with their doors ajar. Officials told News 9 that those did require some maintenance. In spite of initial fears that the aircraft would be out of commission for weeks, officials said they were all back in working order by Tuesday afternoon.

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Prime Minister Tony Abbott reportedly scheduled a last-minute visit to a cancer research centre so he could 'justify' charging Australian taxpayers for a trip to Melbourne to attend a private function. Mr Abbott was an hour late to a meeting of Liberal and National MPs on Tuesday and he explained his tardiness by telling the them he had to schedule an official visit to the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre to justify being in the city under entitlements, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. The private function held on Monday night was a fundraiser for the Liberal party. Prime Minister Tony Abbott shares a joke Ricky Johnstone, Assistant Director of Research at the Peter McCallum hospital in Melbourne on Tuesday . Mr Abbott reportedly scheduled the visit so he could 'justify' billing taxpayers for a fundraising trip to Melbourne . At the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Mr Abbott made no new policy announcements, and told journalists he was there to talk about the government's proposed Medical Research Future Fund. Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has disputed the report that Mr Abbott told MPs he was late in order to justify being in Melbourne for a fundraiser. 'He didn't say that to the party room,' Mr Turnbull told ABC radio on Wednesday. 'Tony was quite upfront and said he had been in Melbourne and he had been to a fundraiser the night before.' Asked if Mr Abbott had said he scheduled the visit so he could justify billing taxpayers, Mr Turnbull said: 'I don't recall him saying that, no'. A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister confirmed that Mr Abbott attended a private fundraising function in Melbourne on Monday night.

'Whenever the Prime Minister travels he maximises his visits by ensuring he participates in community events, business visits and local media.' On Wednesday, parliamentary secretary Steve Ciobo defended the prime minister against what he described as 'slurs'. 'It is crystal clear the prime minister attends events right across the community in a range of areas and there's also a longstanding commitment to medical research,' he told reporters in Canberra. 'It is an absurd proposition to suggest the prime minister is doing anything other than remaining focused as he has been over many, many years to advancing medical research in Australia.' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said it was up to Mr Abbott to explain the situation.

"By . Neil Blincow for MailOnline . By day, Dr. Stephen Kinzey was a respected, tenured professor, loved by his students and well thought of by his university colleagues. But by night, cops claim Kinzey lived a secret shadow life as the drug-dealing, gun-toting leader of an outlaw biker gang called the Devil's Diciples (sic). When police raided the well-tended, Spanish-style home that Kinzey shared with his beautiful blonde girlfriend in an upscale California community, it looked like an episode of TV’s 'Breaking Bad', in which a school chemistry teacher gets sucked into a dangerous double life as a crystal meth dealer. San Bernardino detectives seized more than a pound of methamphetamine, hand guns, rifles, a shotgun, brass knuckles, body armor, cash, leather gear with gang colors and Nazi SS insignias - plus a black jacket bearing the name 'Skinz', the name Kinzey goes by in the biker world. Respectable: Stephen Kinzey, (left) who was professor of kinesiology at Cal State University in San Bernardino, California, was loved by his students and faculty colleagues. They are shocked at the claims against him. The claims have uncanny similarities with Bryan Cranston's character in Breaking Bad (right) 'Outlaw': Kinzey is alleged to be 'Skinz' the gung-toting, drug-dealing leader of the Devil's Diciples gang . That bust at the HQ of Kinzey's alleged drug empire - and his subsequent arrest - came three years ago almost to the day. When Kinzey was arrested on August 26 2011, it sent shock waves through the sprawling campus of Cal State University in San Bernardino, where, for more than a decade, Kinzey, 48, taught kinesiology, the science of human movement. And his arrest stunned the mild mannered professor's neighbors in the quiet, tree-lined section of nearby Highland where he lived with his girlfriend Holly Robinson, his alleged partner in a meth dealing operation that police say raked in big bucks. 'I was shocked', said one neighbor who recalls Kinzey having occasional visits from friends on motor cycles, but no rowdy parties or trouble. 'He always seemed like a nice, friendly person.' Kinzey's father, Hank Kinzey, 69, who lives near Detroit, described Stephen - who was fired from his Cal State teaching job in December 2012 - as a good Catholic and a good father who doesn't drink and doesn't smoke. 'I believe my son is innocent and this is all a huge mistake.' But cops insist there is no mistake - that quiet, reserved Kinzey, who has a 17 year-old daughter from a failed marriage, is indeed a wolf in sheep's clothing, the allege. 'One side of him was a successful and productive member of society, but the other side of him is an outlaw motorcycle gang leader,' San Bernardino County Sheriff's Sgt. Paul Wynn - a lead investigator in the case - told reporters after Kinzey’s arrest. 'He was the highest ranking person in the group, without a doubt.' Wynn was part of a six-month investigation called Operation Devil's Professor' which was launched in 2011 when a separate probe of another biker gang - the Mongols - stumbled upon the name 'Skinz'. That was the name of the president of the San Bernardino chapter of the Devil's Diciples and the alleged mastermind of a major methamphetamine trafficking ring. Haul: Police raided Spanish-style home in San Bernardino he shared with blonde girlfriend and seized a pound of meth, rifles, brass knuckles as Nazi SS insignias . Dealer: Detectives, working with the FBI, tapped Kinzey's cellphone and, after months of undercover surveillance, they concluded he was buying crystal meth in one pound bricks and dividing it into ounce bags . When Skinz allegedly turned out to be Profesor Kinzey - who has bachelors, masters and doctorate degrees and chaired several academic committees at Cal State - even the cops found it hard to believe at first. 'I have kids in college and to have a professor who is a member of the Devil's Diciples and allegedly dealing methamphetamine, is quite alarming - unusual, to say the least,' said then San Bernardino County Sheriff, Rod Hoops at the time. Local detectives, working with the FBI, tapped Kinzey's cellphone and, after months of undercover surveillance, they concluded that he was buying crystal meth in one pound bricks and dividing it into ounce bags which mid-level dealers distributed to street dealers in the San Bernardino area, some 60 miles east of Los Angeles. According to cops, Kinzey used code to communicate with drug dealers and a supplier. In one text he wrote…'bring whatever cabbage u got for my soup cuz ingredients are low'. In another text exchange, Kinzey allegedly questioned a drug source about the quality of his product by asking if he has 'grade-A high quality study materials'. The supplier replied: 'I might as well get a degree.' The end result of the investigation was the August 26, 2011 raid on Kinzey’s home which netted the pound of meth, with a street value of $12,000, guns, Devil’s Diciples paraphernalia…..and the arrest of nine other members of Kinzey's alleged drug ring, including his live-in girlfriend, Holly Robinson. Kinzey wasn't home at the time of the raid but turned himself in later. Kinzey's lawyer, James Glick has claimed that his client 'didn't have anything to do with' the drugs found during the raid on his home. And in one interview shortly after Kinzey’s arrest, Glick added: 'This is not a major drug case - it's just because of what he (Kinzey) does for a living (meaning his then job as a Cal. State professor)'. Moll: Holly Robinson, an ex-Cal State student of Kinzey and his live-in girlfriend who calls his 'old lady', has pleaded not guilty to possession of drugs for sale while armed, possession of drugs for sale and conspiracy . Kinzey faces five felony counts: possessing drugs while armed, participating in a criminal street gang, possession of drugs for sale, conspiracy to sell drugs and receiving a stolen gun. Kinzey - who is pleading not guilty to all the charges and has been free on $300,000 bail - is looking at up to 20 years behind bars if convicted. Holly Robinson - a former Cal State student of Kinzey whom he calls his 'old lady' - has pleaded not guilty to three charges - possession of drugs for sale while armed, possession of drugs for sale and conspiracy. She is scheduled for a court hearing next October along with Jeremy Disney, 33 - the only only other alleged co-conspirator not already convicted and sentenced - who is facing charges of conspiracy and possession of drugs for sale. Since his arrest, seven people arrested in connection with the Kinzey case have already pleaded guilty to charges ranging from conspiracy to drug possession, and been sentenced. Yet Kinzey's day in court has been scheduled and postponed more than a dozen times. He was due in court Wednesday, but the hearing has been delayed again, due to arguments between prosecutors and defense attorneys over whether wire taps and other evidence gathered by cops over a six-month investigation are admissible in court. How does a man like Kinzey, whose worst encounter with cops until this point was a traffic ticket…a highly educated academic who researched the effects of video games on children and who tweeted about his concerns over childhood obesity…end up as the alleged leader of a notorious biker gang that used violence and intimidation to enforce a thriving crystal meth-dealing operation, a gang whose members wear F.T.W. (F--- The World) patches on their black leather jackets? Kinzey's first link with a biker gang was in 1997 when he was teaching at the University of Mississippi where he joined the Boozefighters Motorcycle Club, just as he was getting a divorce. 'I was shocked', said one neighbor in the upscale market street where Kinzey lived with Robinson (above). The neighbor recalled Kinzey having occasional visits from friends on motorbikes, but no rowdy parties or trouble . After he moved to San Bernardino 12 years ago, he hooked up with several different biker groups before forming the local chapter of the Devil's Diciples in 2008. He kept Skinz, his alleged secret biker persona - and his tattoos - well hidden. 'Nobody on the faculty here at Cal State knew that he was a member of a biker group,' said university spokesman Joe Gutierrez. As for Kinzey's students at Cal State, the only clue he gave them of his alleged secret double life was his Harley Davidson which he often rode to work. While a couple of his students said Kinzey had seemed distracted just before his arrest and was sometimes late for class, the majority gave him rave reviews on the website RateMyProfessor.com. 'Great teacher, great person, great friend'……..'Awesome'…….'A cool cat'…….'He really cares about you'. These are just a few of the many comments students posted about their beloved, goateed professor, whom Cal State first placed on paid administrative leave before letting him go in December 2012. While many who know Professor Stephen Kinzey says what a great guy he is, his alleged secret double - Skinz - is a mystery, even to his family. 'I just don’t understand what's going on here', said his dad, Hank, who believes in his son enough to post a $30,000 cash bond for his bail. 'The Stephen Kinzey they're accusing is not the son I know. My son is a wonderful, decent man.'","Respected Cal State professor Stephen Kinzey accused of having secret double life as drug-dealing, gun-toting meth dealer .

'Because I've never met a guy like him before, he makes me feel so special inside,' the anonymous dancer recited. 'I think I'm in love.' Donning a pair of sunglasses and a smart black suit, the dancing man thrust and swung while walking down the train isle in silence. He even managed to throw in some impressive fist pumping as well as swinging off the train’s poles. Meanwhile, the other commuters remained oblivious to the routine being performed , with one person absorbed in their book and another distracted by his head phones. With a final impressive hair flick, the dancing man ended his routine by exited stage right.","A Melbourne man performed a dance routine on a train while a fellow commuter secretly filmed him .

"By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has been forced into an embarrassing backdown over his controversial comments towards 'Chinese mongrels' and 'Chinese b***ards', by delivering a letter of apology to the Chinese Ambassador today. After coming under increasing fire for his bizarre rant last Monday night, Mr Palmer's has delivered a letter to 'His Excellency Mr MA Zhaoxu'. In it he says: 'I most sincerely apologise for any insult to the Chinese people caused by any of the language I used during my appearance on the ABC television program Q&A. Scroll down for video . 'I regret any hurt or anguish such comments may have caused any party and I look forward to greater understanding for peace and cooperation in the future.' He went on to say that 'we always must have an open mind' and that 'I now come to the realisation that what I said on Q&A was an insult to Chinese people everywhere and I wish to assure them they have my most genuine and sincerely apology, that I am sorry that I said the things I said on the program.' Clive Palmer had said about the Chinese that 'they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country', now he says sorry and that 'it is in the interest of the whole world that Australia and China have good relations'. Clive Palmer in the middle of THAT rant on ABC television against the Chinese. Today he's done a complete backflip, apologising in a letter to the Chinese Ambassador, conceding he had insulted ""Chinese people everywhere' Friends again.  This is a picture from back in 2009 where Clive Palmer and Junhua Wu of Metallurgical Corporation of China celebrated the China First mining venture. He also added that 'it is in the interest of the whole world that Australia and China have good relations'. Mr Palmer had been roundly criticised for the rant and his comments labelled 'racist'. Several community leaders and Coalition MPs said the tirade could hurt Australia's trade relationship with China. The Palmer United Party leader tried to appease those critics by suggesting his comments were directed against CITIC Pacific, with whom he's locked in a series of legal disputes, even going as far as tweeting his position. Clive Palmer tried to fend off claims he was racist after the rant last Monday by saying on Twitter that the comments were aimed at a Chinese company only . CITIC has accused Mr Palmer of using $12 million to fund his election campaign in 2013. The verbal spray included him calling Chinese people 'bastards' and 'mongrels' who 'shoot their own people'. 'The Chinese government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free. So far they've shifted $200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it. I don't mind standing up against the Chinese bastards and stop them from doing it,' he said. He then claimed he was owed 'about $500 million by the Communist Chinese government.' 'We'll be suing them and they'll be answering the questions. We've had... an arbitration against these Chinese mongrels - I'm saying that because they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country. And we're not going to let them,' he said. In an attempt to smooth things over, foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the Chinese embassy that 'these were the comments of one Member of Parliament and not representative'. The PM also chimed in by calling them 'over the top, shrill and wrong'. Mr Palmer will hope his letter of apology will bring to an end a forgettable fortnight for his party with his problems exacerbated by star Senate recruit Glenn Lazarus being forced to fend off plagiarism claims and Jacqui Lambie's suggestions Australia needed to significantly boost its military presence or risk 'letting our grandchildren become slaves'.","The Palmer United Party leader has written a letter of apology to the Chinese Ambassador .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . and Lillian Radulova . and Sarah Dean . Eathan Jackson-Cook woke on his 12th birthday yesterday to the news that his four year-old sister had died – leaving him the sole survivor of the crash that had already killed his mother and two other siblings. Eathan, who had already lost his mother Keisha Ann, 30, brother Ryan, 10, and sister Joan, seven, on Friday night when their car slammed into a tree in Queensland, was then told on Monday that his four-year-old sister Matilda died overnight after being in a critical condition from the horrific accident. As the only witness to the accident, Eathan, who is being cared for by his grandmother, is believed by police to be the vital link to discovering how the tragedy occurred, The Gold Coast Bulletin reported. Acting Superintendent John Bosnjak said investigators were working with the boy to reconstruct what happened in the final moments leading up to the family car skidding off a wet Sunshine Coast hinterland road and slamming into trees. Scroll down for video . Four children, Matilda, Ethan, Ryan and Joan, were in the car when it crashed in Queensland on Friday night. Ethan, 11, is the only child who has survived the accident . Krystal Percival (left), the best friend of mother-of-four Keisha Ann Jackson (right) who died after her slammed into a tree on Friday, said that her friend had predicted her own death . Supt Bosnjak said excessive speed was firming as the likely cause. The road was not considered unsafe or dangerous for vehicles travelling at appropriate speed. Eathan, who had been sitting in the front passenger seat, escaped with minor injuries. He and his mother were wearing seatbelts but police say it is inconclusive whether the passengers sitting in the back were properly restrained. The Courier-Mail believes a piece of Ryan’s T-shirt was found still attached to his belt, which could indicate he had it on but was ripped out sideways on impact. A booster seat was in the back of the car for Matilda, but it is unclear whether it was correctly fastened. Ryan and Matilda were found in the grass nearby and appeared to have been thrown from the car on impact. Supt Bosnjak said Matilda, also known as Tilly, had been taken off life support yesterday and all efforts were being made to comfort Eathan. 'It’s his birthday today (yesterday) and they are trying their best to support him,' Supt Bosnjak said. He said the family express its appreciation to emergency service workers at the crash scene. Tilly’s father and the love of Ms Jackson’s life, Michael Cook, suddenly died of a brain aneurism a few years ago. Two of Ms Jackson's children died at the scene. Her oldest son Ethan, 11, managed to escape with only minor injuries while her youngest child, Matilda, 4,died in hospital . In the wake of the tragic incident, Ms Jackson's best friend, Krystal Percival, told the Sunday Mail that Ms Jackson had expressed grave concern about driving along the very road she died on. 'She told me ""One of these days I’m going to die on this corner"",' Ms Percival, 27, said. Since news of the accident spread, family and friends have expressed their shock over the incident. 'I wished this has never happened to you I hope I will see you in the next life in the spirit world and your kids as well. You will always be in my heart for ever,' Amanda Lando wrote on Facebook . Eathan managed to escape the wreck after the accident on Friday night and flag down motorist, Verena Hart, an aged care nurse who had been passing by at the time, reported the Northern Star. 'He was covered in blood and grass and mud, he was all dazed and confused,' she said. Ms Hart, Ethan and a policeman, that he had managed to flag down, then went to find the wreckage together in the dark. They discovered seven-year-old Joan, caught in her seat belt and barely breathing at the scene that Ms Hart described as appearing 'like a bomb had gone off'. Ethan was covered in blood, grass and mud when he flagged down some cars for help, according to witnesses, before he led them back to the scene were his mother (pictured) and siblings had been killed . She was unable to be saved by paramedics and died at the scene. Forensic investigators are still looking into the incident, and are considering the issues of speed and seatbelts. 'There are several factors we are looking at, particularly speed, they are awaiting toxicology reports which will take some time to establish if there is anything in that regard to look at,'Acting Superintendent John Boznjak said told Sunshine Coast Daily.","Eathan Jackson-Cooke, lost his mother Keisha Ann, 30, brother Ryan, 10, and sister Joan, seven, when their car slammed into a tree in Queensland .

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . An animal welfare group has created a moving video featuring Australian children pleading with McDonald's to stop using cage eggs. Animals Australia put a call out to kids to upload a video message encouraging McDonald's to switch to free range eggs, and compiled some of the best entries to make a short video. 'Hi, my name's Maple, I don't want chickens to be in cages because I want them to be free and happy,' one young girl says. Scroll down for video . Animals Australia put a call out to Australian kids to upload a video message encouraging McDonald's to switch to free range eggs . 'Chickens have feelings too,' another young boy says. Two other boys then chime in, telling the camera: 'Chickens need to flap and stretch their wings… but battery hens can't'. A boy dressed up in a waistcoat and glasses then points to a drawing on a chalkboard and says: 'It would be much better if they were happy in the grass.' McDonald's uses 91 million cage eggs per year in Australia but does not use cage eggs in the UK or Europe, and is phasing them out in New Zealand. Animals Australia campaign director Lyn White said the organisation had been in discussion with McDonald's Australia about phasing out caged eggs for seven years. A boy dressed up in a waistcoat and glasses and points to a drawing on a chalkboard then says: 'It would be much better if they were happy in the grass.' 'Until now, we had refrained from publicly identifying their failure to meet their global guiding principles on animal welfare in hoping that through consultation they would match commitments made in other countries,' Ms White said. 'As they have failed to move on this issue, based on not having enough public feedback to warrant a transition, it was appropriate to start ensuring that they did.' Ms White added that she hoped McDonald's would recognise the 'commercial benefits of positively responding to a plea from Australian kids'. 'A significant number of McDonald's' customer base is children, children who love animals, and who don't accept that hens should be kept in cages,' she said. McDonald's uses 91 million cage eggs per year in Australia but does not use cage eggs in the UK or Europe and is phasing them out in New Zealand . 'It seems that children themselves understand that you cannot have ""Happy Meals"" if animals are suffering.' A McDonald's spokeswoman said the company is exploring a move to cage-free eggs but it was not a straight-forward decision. 'We are working through a number of issues with our suppliers, including the fact that there are not currently enough available cage-free eggs in Australia to meet our needs,' she said in a statement. 'This means that change will progress over time. For example, as a first step we are looking at converting to cage-free eggs for our omelettes in McCafé.' Animals Australia campaign director Lyn White said the organisation had been in discussion with McDonald's Australia about phasing out caged eggs for seven years . The spokeswoman added that McDonald's had to consider the impact any decisions it made would have on Australian farmers. 'We take very seriously our responsibility to ensure that the animals in our supply chain are properly cared for,' she said. 'All of our animal health and welfare standards meet or exceed all Australian requirements.'","Animals Australia asked kids to upload a video message encouraging McDonald's to switch to free range eggs .

"By . Associated Press . Cristobal strengthened into a hurricane in the Atlantic as it moved away from the Bahamas on Monday, leaving behind flooded communities across a swath of soaked Caribbean islands and at least three fatalities. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said that by Monday evening the hurricane was centered about 660 miles (1,065 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and was tracking east at 2 mph (4 kph). The storm was projected to later move on a slow north-northeastward track, with a gradual increase in forward speed. It was expected to pass to the west and north of Bermuda on Wednesday. Hurricane Cristobal: By Monday evening the hurricane was centered about 660 miles (1,065 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda . Moving fast: By Momday evening Hurricane Cristobal had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and was tracking east at 2 mph (4 kp) Before strengthening into a hurricane, the storm flooded several communities across the Caribbean and halted flights in the drenched Turks & Caicos Islands. Government offices and banks were shuttered Monday on the low-lying islands that are highly vulnerable to flooding from heavy rains and storm surge, and authorities said many homes were flooded, especially on North and Middle Caicos islands. Officials in Turks & Caicos said some 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain had been dumped since Friday. In the Bahamas, government meteorologists warned that severe thunderstorms from the storm's outer bands posed threats Monday to Mayaguana, Acklins and a few other islands and they called for boaters to return to port and residents to stay indoors. On the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, two Dominican men drowned and two Haitians went missing when they were caught up in waterways swollen by Cristobal's driving rains. Authorities said they were still searching for the two Haitians missing since late Saturday in Saint Marc, a port town on the country's west coast. On Monday, the Turks & Caicos governor's office reported one storm fatality in the tiny archipelago, saying a body was recovered from floodwaters on the main island of Providenciales. Florida weather: Winds from the Northeast and rough surf hit the beaches on Monday morning . High winds: Twenty five mph winds from the Northeast and rough surf hit the Jacksonville Beach in Florida . About 3,600 people were evacuated from communities in the Dominican Republic, according to Jose Manuel Mendez, director of the country's emergency operations center. More than half returned to their homes by Monday. Roughly 640 Haitian families were left temporarily homeless during the passage of the storm, said Luckecy Mathieu, a civil protection coordinator. At least 28 homes were badly damaged and four others were destroyed, he said. Many beaches along the U.S. east coast - from Florida to Washington - are expected to feel Cristobal's effects as it tracks north through the Atlantic this week. The National Weather Service warned of strong rip currents, as strong winds from the northeast are pushing large waves toward the shore. Beach goers should also be prepared for waves ranging from three to five feet, according to The Washington Post. Meanwhile in the Pacific, Hurricane Marie was moving northwest as a major Category 4 storm, bringing high waves but no threat of a direct hit to Mexico's Pacific coast. The weakening hurricane's sustained winds were near 135 mph (214 kph) with more weakening expected over the next two days. It was centered about 490 miles (790 kilometers) southwest of the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California Peninsula. Swells generated by Marie were affecting the southwestern coast of Mexico and the southern gulf of California. National Hurricane Center forecasters said the swells were expected to reach southern California by Tuesday and were likely to cause 'life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.' Tropical storm:  A tropical depression formed over the Turks and Caicos Islands on Saturday as it headed toward the Bahamas and dumped heavy rains on parts of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic .

"By . James Rush . and David Mccormack for MailOnline . A 59-year-old man who was lucky to survive a bear attack has spoken of the dramatic moment he and his pet dog fought the animal off. Steven Krichbaum, of Staunton, Virginia, came across the black bear and her two cubs while walking in the woods in Hardy County, West Virginia, with his yellow Labrador mix Henry. Mr Krichbaum and his dog were both seriously injured after the bear attacked, while fearing for the safety of her cubs, at the George Washington National Forest on Thursday. Steven Krichbaum holds a bloody rock that he used to strike a bear that attacked him while he was out walking with his dog in the George Washington National Forest last week . Mr Krichbaum and his yellow Labrador mix, called Henry, were both seriously injured after the bear attacked, while fearing for the safety of her cubs . He has now described how Henry distracted the bear as it attacked him, before he managed to strike the bear in the head with a rock. 'I didn't want to killer her,' Mr Krichbaum told The Northern Virginia Daily. 'I wanted her to go away and stop biting me.' Mr Krichbaum told the paper how he remembered the moment the bear sunk its teeth into his leg during the attack after his dog chased the two cubs into the forest. Mr Krichbaum said while he was being attacked his dog Henry managed to distract the bear, who then went for the pet, which allowed him to pick up a rock. Mr Krichbaum then struck the bear in the head with the rock, allowing him and his dog to return to their car before driving to a Frederick County fruit market in search of assistance. Mr Krichbaum, 59, of Staunton, Virginia, is treated for his injuries after being attacked by a bear. His brave pet Henry sits in between his legs . Mr Krichbaum has described how Henry distracted the bear as it attacked him, before he managed to strike the bear with a rock . Mr Krichbaum was then taken to Winchester Medical Center where he received treatment for the severe injuries. The bear has since evaded attempts to capture it following the attack, the Associated Press has reported. Traps were set by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources the day after the attack but removed on Monday. Colin Carpenter, the West Virginia Division of Natural Resource’s black bear project leader, told The Winchester Star on Friday that authorities planned to kill the bear and her cubs if they captured them. Hero: Henry was taken by the Frederick County Sheriff's Animal Control unit to a local emergency animal hospital after suffering an injury to his hind leg in the bear attack . An online petition however was set up calling for the plans to be revised. The petition, posted on change.org, had 2,000 signatures by yesterday. Jamie Sajecki, Virginia’s black bear project leader, told The Northern Virginia Daily, how the state does not take action against bears if they are provoked into attacking, which he said is what appears to have happened in this instance. He said: 'Because the dog precipitated this event, we wouldn’t necessarily put a bear down in that situation because she was out in her habitat where she should have been.'","Steven Krichbaum, 59, speaks of the moment he was attacked by black bear .

"By . Sarah Dean for Daily Mail Australia . A woman has made a desperate plea to stop a local council killing her dog Hugo after he was captured while wondering off his lead near her home. Lynette Mcilveen, from Hope Island on the Gold Coast, has been told by authorities they plan to destroy her pet in ten days. The distraught dog owner has blasted the council and told the Today Show on Tuesday they have 'made a decision based on fear.' Two-year-old Hugo was found wandering without a lead at about 4.30pm on August 20 after escaping from his home. Scroll down for video . Gold Coast woman Lynette McIlveen claims she has been told by authorities that they plan to destroy her pet dog Hugo in ten days . The council have argued he was also found to be responsible for rushing at a dog and its owner in Charles Holm Park at 6.30am on 20 February 2014. However, Ms Mcilveen argued that Hugo is not dangerous. 'He's playful, his tail would have been wagging... but obviously Hugo is a big dog,' she said. She has started a petition to save her family's Shar Pei and it has already received over 700 signatures. 'This is important because Hugo is innocent .... he is a friendly dog who has been treated unjustly because we have neglected to see that our inability to be vigilant has led to our boy being detained and threatened with death. 'He is our family member...we love him, he means everything to us. Please don't do this to Hugo.' 'We love him': Hugo's owners have claimed he is a friendly family dog who doesn't deserve to die . 'Obviously he's a big dog': Ms Mcilveen has argued Hugo is 'playful, his tail would have been wagging' when he approached people off his lead . Hugo is currently being kept in a concrete cage at a compound by the council and Ms Mcilveen has been visiting him daily. She has begged for him to be brought home and has promised she will not let him off his lead again. 'You have picked the wrong animal. Hugo doesn't deserve to die because our family has neglected to do what the council asks... we love him he's our boy. 'It's not Hugo's fault, we are responsible for this, it will never ever happen again.' The Courier Mail reports Hugo's owners have admitted they once told Gold Coast City Council the animal was dead to avoid it being taken. A spokesperson for Gold Coast council told Daily Mail Australia: 'The owner has been told they have 14 days to appeal the notice and they are well within their rights.' Cry for help:  Hugo's family have set up a Facebook page to help raise awareness of their plight. It already has over 11,000 fans . Promises: The family has pleaded that they will not let the Shar Pei off his lead again . 'We are not going to be swayed by public opinion. The dog was surrendered to us by the owner, they took it to the pound after we issued the destruction notice on 22 August. We didn't take it from the yard.' 'Destruction notices are a last resort for the council... it's not a decision we take lightly,' they added. In an official statement the council said: 'The destruction of regulated dogs is the last resort for City of Gold Coast, which works with all dog owners to ensure the public’s safety is protected. 'Public safety must take precedent over poor behaviour from dog owners that sees their animals roaming the streets and menacing people and other dogs. Last resort: The Gold Coast council said the destruction of regulated dogs is the last resort for them . 'Running with an order to kill him': The council said a destruction order was issued on 22 August. The owner surrendered the dog to the pound and has 14 days to appeal, the council added . 'Council is restricted from listing the details of offences involving this dog but it has been involved in numerous incidents. 'Council will give the appeal every consideration. Ms Mcilveen has also started a Facebook page for Hugo that now has over 11,000 likes. On Monday night she wrote: 'Good night my boy Hugo, I love you and know how horrible it is for you at this time. I pray for you to be returned to us soon and Hugo just look how many love you…Hang in there big boy for we are never going to give up on you.

"By . Australian Associated Press . A man who pleaded guilty over his role in a drunken assault in which a Sydney man suffered serious head injuries has been given a 12-month good behaviour bond and told to grow up and keep his nose clean. Jamie Ennis, 24, appeared in Downing Centre Local Court on Tuesday for sentencing over the December assault at Bondi which left Michael McEwen fighting for his life with serious head injuries. Both men were 'well intoxicated' at the time of the fight and Magistrate Lee Gilmour told Ennis he had 'to grow up'. 'Alcohol will explain why you are acting like a goose but it will never excuse it,' she said. Scroll down for video . Michael Ennis, 24, leaves Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney today after getting a 12-month good behaviour bond and a stern warning from the judge . Michael McEwen sustained serious head injuries in the attack, which he claims he doesn't remember . Ennis was on bail at the time of the assault and now has two convictions on his record. 'You don't want a third,' Ms Gilmour warned. She added: 'You must keep your nose squeaky clean'. Ennis had initially pleaded not guilty to affray. It was alleged he started the fight by arguing with Mr McEwen and grabbing his shirt. Another man, who was drinking with Ennis that evening, then punched and kicked Mr McEwen. Mr McEwan told 60 Minutes in February he had no memory of the attack, and has had trouble getting his head around what happened. 'At first I just didn’t believe it,' he said. 'It really sank in when they had the TV on and it was the news, I think, and my face was on it and it was like, ""Bondi bashing victim awakes from coma"",' he said. In sentencing, the judge gave Ennis a stern warning, saying: '[You] seem to be a hard worker. Don't ruin that.' In July, Ennis' lawyers offered to plead guilty to common assault if the affray charge was dropped. Police agreed and didn't oppose the defence's recommendation of a good behaviour bond in court on Tuesday. Ennis was arrested just before Christmas and spent the holiday period in jail. The 16 days in custody was 'something he will reflect back on,' the court heard. During the brief sentencing, Ms Gilmour said Ennis 'seems to be a hard worker'. 'Don't ruin that,' she said.

"By . Elanor Crooks, Press Association . Novak Djokovic cast off concerns over his form and mindset by easing to a 6-1 6-2 6-4 win over Diego Schwartzman in the first round of the US Open. Since winning Wimbledon, the world number one has had off-court matters on his mind, with marriage to long-term partner Jelena to be followed in October by the birth of their first child. He made a decidedly sluggish start to the North American hard-court season and arrived in New York with not many matches under his belt after losing early in Toronto and Cincinnati. Smooth progress: Novak Djokovic beat Diego Schwartzman 6-1 6-2 6-4 in the US Open first round . On the stretch: Djokovic reaches to make a return during his straight sets win on Arthur Ashe . Forward defence: Djokovic was in excellent form despite a busy summer in his personal life . VIDEO Djokovic cruises through in New York . But Djokovic was quick to show Argentinian Schwartzman who was boss under the lights on Arthur Ashe, racing into a 4-0 lead. Schwartzman clearly wanted to make the most of the occasion and urged the crowd to raise the noise level after a precision lob and forehand winner helped him get on the board with a break of the Djokovic serve. It was merely a blip, though, and 79th-ranked Schwartzman did not win another game until he was 2-0 down in the second set, finally holding serve for the first time. The precision on Djokovic's shots was far too good for his opponent, highlighted by a forehand winner hit round the net post to gasps and cheers. Overwhelmed: Argentinian opponent Diego Schwartzman had no answer to Djokovic . All change: The Wimbledon champion swaps shirts in warn New York evening . Spectacle: There was a healthy crowd on Arthur Ashe for the occasion . Schwartzman is much more at home on clay than hard courts but made a better fight of things in the third as Djokovic's level dropped. The Serbian was never in any danger, though, and served out victory after an hour and 37 minutes, the final act a rather fortunate net cord. Djokovic, who next plays France's Paul-Henri Mathieu, said: 'I'm very pleased. It's never easy to start a US Open smoothly. I love playing night sessions, it's probably the most special court in the world for night sessions.'","Novak Djokovic won first round encounter 6-1 6-2 6-4 .

"By . Nelson Groom For Daily Mail Australia . A far-right political party from Greece, which openly admits to admiring Adolf Hitler but denies it draws inspiration from the Nazis, is planning to visit Australia. The Golden Dawn Party, which has been criticised for its fascist beliefs and accused of violence towards immigrants, claims it already has thousands of Australian supporters and plans to raise money during trips to Sydney and Melbourne in October. Australian spokesperson for the group, Ignatius Gavrilidis, has told the ABC that Golden Dawn party members Eleftherios Synadinos and Georgios Epitideios are hoping to 'raise money and gather support amongst young Australians'. Scroll down for video . A Golden Dawn supporter performing a Nazi salute in an Athens rally, February this year . Supporters of Golden Dawn, an extreme right-wing party accused of spreading fascist ideology, holding flares and Greek flags at an Athens protest . Golden Dawn have gained considerable support during the economic crises gripping the European Nation, gaining 9.4 per cent of the popular vote back in May, making them the third most prominent political party in Greece. The leader of the party, Nikolass Michaloliakos, is currently in prison, awaiting trial on charges of murder, extortion, and involvement in the disappearance of up to 100 immigrants. Mr Gavrilidis says there are about 70 campaigners in Australia, but thousands more followers. The party also has political allies, including Sydney based far-right party Australia First. He denies Golden Dawn, which uses Nazi-inspired signs and logos to promote the party, is a modern incarnation of fascist WWII-era Germany, despite admitting some of its members support Adolf Hitler. 'Yes, they have admired the leadership of Hitler, just like we also admire the leadership of many strong leaders across the world,' he said. Golden Dawn spokesperson Ignatius Gavrilidis says that while some Golden Dawn members support Adolf Hitler, they are not a Nazi party . Former army general Eleftgerios Synadinos, left, and Georgios Epideios, right, want to raise money and spread awareness about Golden Dawn during a planned visit to Australia in October . The Golden Dawn members could face difficulties with the proposed trip. The group is considered a criminal organisation in Greece, and supporters of such groups can be denied entry into Australia. Victorian Liberal MP Nick Kotsiras, a former minister in the State Government, told ABC: 'I would hope that these individuals are checked, their backgrounds are checked by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to make sure that if they don't fit into that criteria, they are not allowed to enter Australia.' There is also a threat from local opposition. Several Golden Dawn supporters were assaulted at a protest they organised in Brisbane last year. It's likely the proposed October events could be met with similar hostility.

"By . Tom Pugh . and Catherine Wylie, Daily Mail Reporter . Guitar legend Jimmy Page, pictured performing during the 1970s, is responsible for the greatest ever guitar riff, according to BBC Radio 2 listeners . Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love is the greatest guitar riff of all time, as chosen by BBC Radio 2 listeners. In a list of the top 100, it beat rock legend contenders such as Metallica, Nirvana and The White Stripes to the top spot. The top five guitar riffs are completed by Guns 'N' Roses' Sweet Child O' Mine at two, AC/DC's Back in Black at three, Deep Purple's Smoke On The Water at four and Derek And The Dominoes' Layla at five. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page said: 'I'm knocked out by this because I didn't expect that to happen - there's been so many wonderful riffs along the way. 'I wanted a riff that really moved, that people would really get, and would bring a smile to their faces... but when I played it with the band, it really went into overdrive. 'There was this intent to have this riff and the movement of it, so it was menacing as well as quite sort of caressing.' A panel of music experts, including music critics, record producers and the station's presenters, helped produce the top 100, which spans generations. Launched last month by Radio 2's Simon Mayo as part of Guitar Season, a poll asked listeners to cast their vote online for their favourite guitar riff. Throughout yesterday, listeners were treated to the complete top 100 countdown with the big reveal beginning with Will Gompertz's midnight show and culminating in Zoe Ball announcing numbers 30 through to the top spot in her special Bank Holiday show. Steve Levine, record producer and panelist, said: 'Whole Lotta Love is one of the most important guitar riffs of the twentieth century - the moment you hear literally two notes of it, you know exactly what it is.' Page said he wanted a riff that people would 'really get, and would bring a smile to their faces' The classic riff in the song Sweet Child O'Mine by Guns N' Roses' Slash, pictured, came second .","Led Zeppelins's Whole Lotta Love named the greatest guitar riff of all time .

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Britain's Johanna Konta fell at the first hurdle in the US Open with defeat by Israel's Shahar Peer. Konta secured a place at Flushing Meadows on her own ranking for the first time, but was unable to take advantage, losing 6-2 6-3. At 118 in the world, Konta is ranked 37 places higher than Peer, but the Israeli has the pedigree, having once been the world number 11. Solid: Peer may be ranked a lowly 155th in the world but she has experience and outclassed Konta . And Konta found Peer simply too steady, a tally of 15 winners and 34 unforced errors for the British number two rather telling its own story. Konta had a chance to get back on serve in the second set when Peer slipped to 15-40 serving for the match, but she could not take advantage. British number one Heather Watson begins her campaign against Romania's Sorana Cirstea on Tuesday. Konta was left cursing missed opportunities after taking just one of eight break points. 'It didn't go the way I wanted it to,' said the 23-year-old. 'I had my chances and I just wasn't able to capitalise on them. It was frustrating but she played tough in those points. I felt I gave it my best today and that's all I can do. Unforced: The British woman made far too many mistakes, handing her opponent 24 free points in 17 games . 'It's great being direct acceptance and I've very much enjoyed that here and at Wimbledon. But I definitely want to be getting deeper into these tournaments. 'I've had a lot of changes come my way this year, a lot of personal things. I just need to keep working hard and trust that the results will come.' Konta was playing only her third match in more than a month after recovering from a right wrist problem. She said: 'That's all fine now.

"By . Stephen Johns for The Daily Mail . Jean-Claude Juncker, the incoming president of the European Commission, has said he will address any gender imbalance through the portfolio selection . David Cameron was last night warned to send a woman to Europe or risk Britain forfeiting a top role at the European Commission. Jean-Claude Juncker is piling pressure on national leaders to change their nominations for the Commission and put forward more female candidates. The incoming President of the European Commission said women would have a ‘very good chance’ of getting the plum jobs. Mr Juncker told an Austrian newspaper: ‘Unfortunately, and despite my repeated requests, most of the governments insist on sending male candidates. ‘A Commission without a significant number of women is, in my view, neither legitimate nor credible. ‘That is why I am continuing to insist with several heads of state and government that they send me a female candidate. In the end, should there still not be a sufficient number of women, I will need to redress the balance through the portfolio allocation. ‘Female commissioners will then certainly have very good chances of landing an important portfolio or of getting one of the most sought-after posts of vice-president, acting as my deputies.’ Mr Cameron has selected Lord Hill of Oareford as the candidate to be Britain’s European Commissioner - and will push for a key economic position. The Prime Minister hopes the Conservative peer will be given an economic brief, such as competition or financial services, to help the Government obtain significant reforms in the European Union. European leaders will discuss which countries are given the leading positions in the Commission this weekend at a dinner in Brussels, but crucially Mr Juncker will have the final say over appointments. They will also choose a successor for Baroness Ashton, who was appointed EU foreign minister five years ago. Lord Hill is little-known in European circles and his selection has caused tensions with Mr Juncker who reportedly had to Google the peer. Scroll down for video... It was reported Mr Juncker's staff had to perform a Google search on Lord Hill when his candidacy was announced . Mr Juncker has indicated that high-profile candidates, who have held senior ministerial jobs, will be well-placed for top positions, which may also make it less likely that Lord Hill will secure a leading portfolio. It was reported that Mr Juncker’s staff had to perform an internet search on Mr Cameron’s choice as Britain’s new European Commissioner. Earlier this summer Mr Cameron failed to block the appointment of the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg when he forced a vote of EU states on the selection of the politician - but lost it by 26 to two. Mr Juncker is expected to name his appointments in three weeks’ time, but so far only four women have been publicly nominated for posts. A Downing Street source told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Lord Hill is the right person for the job. He’s got the right blend of experience in business, as well as working at the highest levels of government, to be an extremely effective commissioner.’","Jean-Claude Juncker suggests leaders put forward women for Europe roles .

A 10th grade english teacher at a Houston high school has managed to avoid going to prison despite admitting to having a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student. Nikki Scherwitz, 25, pleaded guilty to having an inappropriate relationship with a student and was sentenced to 10 years probation. She was also fined $5,000, KHOU reported. Scherwitz resigned from her job at Brazosport High School last year when she was questioned about the relationship. Nikki Scherwitz resigned from her job at Brazosport High School last year when she was questioned about the relationship. She has since pleaded guilty and been sentenced . Nikki Scherwitz, who taught 10th Grade English at Brazosport High School, Houston, was charged with sexual assault of a child and improper relationship with a student. She pleaded guilty and has been placed on 10 years probation. She will never teach again . Scherwitz wrote letters of apologies to the boy's mother and the district, admitting her guilt . According to KHOU.com, authorities were tipped off after Scherwitz turned up to an after-prom party on April 20 at a student's house. One of the students who was at the party told the TV station: 'She was wearing no shoes when she showed up…like a cut up, cut off shirt and everything.' She is also believed to have been drinking. Another student told her it wasn't right for her to be there and asked her to leave. She and the 16-year-old student then allegedly left together. Some students were shocked when they learned she got probation. 'The men get 25 to life, but a woman gets a slap on the wrist with only a $5,000 fine,' said Mario Salinas, a student at Brazosport High School. 'If it was a guy, a male teacher with a female student, it wouldn’t be the same,' agreed Oscar Guttierrez, another student. Resigned: She had only been working at Brazosport High School for nine months - the boy is said to have been in her class . Prosecutors said they agreed to the plea deal because the student was nearly 17 and Sherwitz agree to send apologies to the mother and the district. In that letter she said: ""I apologize for the behavior I engaged in with a student. I crossed an ethical boundary I never should have crossed. I’m sorry."" 'I think she should get more than just probation because that’s a kid,' said Robert Anderson whose grandchild attends the school. 'I think she should get more than just probation because that’s a kid and you shouldn’t have relationships with a young minor.' Scherwitz has been ordered to stay away from minors and she won’t be allowed to ever teach again.","Nikki Scherwitz, 25, pleaded guilty .

"By . Daniel Piotrowski for Daily Mail Australia . The cafe owner who refused to give a barista a job because customers would not want 'coffee made by black people' appears to have closed his shop following a boycott. As first reported by the Daily Mail Australia, Steven Hu, the owner of the Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst in inner city Sydney, made the remarks more than a week ago  to Brazilian-born Australian Nilson Dos Santos, 39. The cafe has since been the subject of a widespread customer boycott as well as egging and flour bomb attacks. The coffee shop was packed with lunchtime customers the day the owner denied Mr Do Santos a job on the basis of his skin colour. But there was no one inside the cornerside store on Tuesday morning. Scroll down for video . Empty: A lone pot plant sat the door the deserted Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst when the Daily Mail Australia visited on Tuesday. The racially-charged incident involving Brazillian-born barista Nilson Dos Santos, left, and cafe owner Steven Hu, right, has sparked international headlines. Deserted: There was no sign of life inside the inner-city cafe that was the scene of the alleged racist incident the Sunday before last. Pink chairs that served as part of the cafe's outdoor setting, lower left, have been moved inside. Closed for business: A pot plant sat on the front step of the once-bustling breakfast and lunch location this morning. Unintelligible grafitti was also scrawled across the concrete out the front. The lights were off, a lone pot plant sat on the doorstep and the cafe's outdoor setting had been stacked inside. Mr Hu told Daily Mail Australia: 'I won't say anything, sorry,' and hung up. Calls to the business's landline were not returned. The coffee shop's apparent closure comes after many customers pledged to take their business elsewhere. Stunned customers walked out of the store on the day of the incident after Mr Dos Santos announced what Mr Hu had said to him. In the days since many users have posted on the cafe's Facebook page committing to a boycott. One punter, Michelle Cavanagh, wrote: 'After what I've just read about a Brazilian barista being told he couldn't have a job because he was black don't expect me to ever Grace your doors.' One-time patron Sonia Cattley said she would no longer buy her coffee there. 'I have been a regular here on the way to work....you will now be seeing me pass with a coffee from another store in my hand...absolutely disgusted.' They were joined by Viet Anh, who remarked that there were many alternative cafes nearby. 'I say definitely all people should avoid this cafe because in Darlinghurst there are no shortage of cafes.' A popular meme has also been circulated saying 'Boycott Forbes and Burton... #UnAustralian #NoRacism'. Some customers said Mr Hu could rectify the situation with an apology, and perhaps a job offer. Rachel Frere said: 'Please offer the brazilian man the job and Ill come for a coffee.' Vincent Mok added: 'Mr Hu, would you retract your comments about Mr Dos Santos, hire him, be on good terms with him and others, sincerely apologise to the world and move on? It is never too late to say sorry.' The once-popular cafe appeared to have been egged at the weekend, according to these images that were posted on social media. 'Hope your shop burns down': One of many messages left on the cafe's Facebook wall as of Tuesday morning. No staff, customers or cafe owner Steven Hu, left, were present at the Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst when the Daily Mail Australia visited on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Mr Dos Santos said last week that he has received more than 20 job offers. Some comments crossed the line. 'Hope your cafe burns down,' said one recent post. While the cafe's fortunes have gone downhill, Mr Dos Santos was deluged with more than 20 job offers in the aftermath of the incident. He told Daily Mail Australia immediately following the incident: ‘I have never experienced anything like that in Australia,’ he said. ‘I love it here, I am free here, that’s why I chose to stay. I’ve always felt welcomed and accepted. For me, it was never a problem that I am black until today. Mr Hu admitted making the remarks at the time. 'There are a lot of white customers at the café and I think the clients here want local people, not African people,' he said at the time. 'We need to offer good service at this café and I think the coffee culture is more about white people. The Fair Work Ombudsman is continuing to investigate the matter.

The most notable piece of action - away from both sets of supporters throwing bottles and flares onto the pitch - came during a penalty shoot-out between the two Istanbul-based rivals. Brazilian midfielder Felipe Melo stepped up to the plate to take a penalty but blazed the ball high over the bar. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Volkan Demirel jump on Galatasaray's Felipe Melo . Jump on it: Volkan Demirel decided to charge at Felipe Melo after the Brazilian missed a penalty . Late drama: The incident came after the two sides played out a goalless draw . Confrontation: Demirel and Melo had to be separated by the referee during their public row . Winners: Istanbul-based outfit Fenerbahce went onto win the Turkish Super Cup on penalties . Bright spark: Galatasaray fans lit up red flares during the clash between the two rivals . Ditto: Fenerbahce fans also decided to fill the stadium with smoke by lighting flares . Controversy: Graeme Souness, who managed Galatasaray in the 95-96 season, decided to plant his side's flag in the middle of Fenerbahce's pitch . Games between Turkish giants Fenerbahce and Galatasaray are extremely competitive due to their domestic success and the fact that they are both based in Istanbul. Both sides have a strong fanbase who are extremely passionate about all things connected with their respective teams. The rivalry stretches beyond football as both sides compete in other sports such as basketball, volleyball and rowing. Fenerbahce and Galatasaray came close to joining forces in 1912 however the idea did not come to fruition due to the Balkan Wars. Former Premier League manager Graeme Souness was involved in a high-profile incident between the two sides when the then Galatasaray manager decided to plant his side's flag in the middle of Fenerbahce's pitch after winning the Turkish Cup final - leaving the home fans furious. To make matters worse for Melo, Fenerbahce goalkeeper Volkan Demirel decided to jump on the back of the 31-year-old midfielder to spark a brief confrontation between both sets of players. Melo, who was close to joining Arsenal in July 2010, was far from happy with Demirel's antics and the pair had to be separated by the referee. The Brazilian may have been targeted by Demirel as Melo was pictured laughing hysterically when Fenerbahce midfielder Emre was sent off in a fixture between the two sides at the Turk Telekom Arena at the back end of last season. Demirel's side went onto lift the Turkish Super Cup 3-2 on penalties to the delight of the Fenerbahce fans.

"By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . The Government's razor gang has found another victim - the Australian War Memorials long-standing travelling exhibitions program. The Australian War Memorial has been forced to end its popular travelling exhibitions program due to Budget cuts. After 17 years of successful exhibitions, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs informed the Memorial that it will stop its funding of the travelling exhibition program, effective immediately. In April next year Australians will commemorate 100 years since the first ANZAC landings at Gallipoli but unless a private backer is found, there is no plan to reinstate the historic travelling exhibitions. Part of the exhibitions are images form soldier and surgeon Sir Charles Ryan, who captured the Australians’ experience on Gallipoli in 1915 in a series of candid photographs. (Above) Gallipoli Peninsula, Turkey, May 1915. Two soldiers of the Supply Depot, 1st Australian Division, stand on the beach among boxes of corned beef. Rows of petrol and water held in cans are in the foreground. The War Memorial's caption for the photograph is:  'Here, in Ryan’s display of mateship, stoicism and dogged endurance, is the spirit of Anzac'. 'Remember Me' (above) from the The Lost Diggers of Vignacourt exhibition. This photograph from November 1918, shows locals and Australian soldiers gathering on the street prior to a march and commemoration ceremony at the Vignacourt cemetery, in France . This picture from Sir Ryan's collection was taken in May 1915. Officers and soldiers are pictured conferring in a trench reinforced with sandbags on one of the ridges at Gallipoli. Captain Harry Hartley walks down the steps of the Church of Saint-Firmin, Vignacourt, with his new bride Simone Marie Pecourt, a local Vignacourt woman. He was a captain with the 1st Australian Division Supply Column. Cpt Hartley met Simone while he was stationed in the town. After the war they lived in Amiens, where they set up a tyre business. They had two children and stayed in Amiens until the German occupation of France in 1940. Cpt Hartley was killed during the evacuations. The razor gang took $800,000 away from the War Memorial Exhibitions but at the same time the government spends more than $70 million on floor space for 2000 Defence Department employees, yet thousands of square metres remain empty. This includes $330,000 spent on Immigration Minister Scott Morrison's new media room, which has been dubbed 'The Empty Room' because it is yet to be used. It even has a $800 door knob. There was also more than $15,000 of taxpayer dollars were spent on a second custom-built bookcase for Attorney-General George Brandis because the old $7000 version was too big to fit in the Senator's new office. The exhibitions touring this year include the popular 'Remember Me: The Lost Diggers of Vignacourt', which provides some amazing insights into the life of Australian soldiers behind the front lines of the Somme, through a collection of more than 800 black and white photographs. This series of amazing images is now on show in Adelaide. The War Memorial has given Daily Mail Australia permission to display some of the priceless photographs for the benefit of readers who will now have to travel to Canberra to have any chance of viewing them. War Memorial director Brendan Nelson said exhibitions have been taken to museums and galleries across Australia for almost two decades.

Several of the soldiers wear identity bracelets in the shape of Australia. c 1918 . 'In delivering travelling exhibitions to the Australian public, particularly in regional and rural areas, the Memorial has told the story of Australia’s military history with support of the Memorial’s extensive national collection,' Dr Nelson said. Also missing in action now will be the likes of 'Ben Quilty: After Afghanistan' and 'A Camera on Gallipoli', which showcases photographs of the ANZACS drawn from private collections assembled during the Gallipoli campaign. 'The travelling exhibitions program has been delivered through supplementary funding of $800,000 a year,' Dr Nelson said.

While at right, an image of a fellow signaller, also from the Thuillier collection of glass plate negatives. Children and townspeople gather in the Vignacourt cemetery for a commemoration ceremony given by the mayor of Vignacourt. Care of the cemetery and graves was handed over to the local children. This is Vignacourt, France during the period 1916 to 1918. 'The Department will certainly not have found this an easy decision. 'As a result, the Memorial must cease the travelling exhibitions program. This will take effect immediately. 'We are very disappointed.' All travelling exhibitions will return to the Memorial once they conclude at their current venues. On average 200,000 Australians, many in regional areas, view the various exhibitions each year. 'The immediate future is that some of the travelling exhibitions will go on to their next venue or destination and then come back to the memorial,' Dr Nelson added. Three unidentified soldiers sit down to tea with several local French civilian women. From the Thuillier collection of glass plate negatives. c 1916-18 . He also hoped the funding cut would not lead to job losses. 'I want to keep the staff if I possibly can... we have six full-time staff,' he said. 'My priority is to do everything we can to look after them and I'm reasonably confident we'll be able to do that.'","The long-running Australian Warm Memorial 'Travelling Exhibitions' program has been stopped after almost 20 years .
The Department of Veterans' Affairs withdrew $800,000 funding for the program .

"By . John Mcgarry . Gordon Strachan believes there's no chance his Scotland players will melt in the white-hot heat of the Westfalenstadion against the might of Germany. The national manager has named a 26-man squad to face the recently-crowned world champions on Sunday week at the 80,000 capacity home of Borussia Dortmund. Strachan called up uncapped midfielder duo Callum McGregor and Kevin McDonald to offset the absence of injured trio Scott Brown, James Forrest and Robert Snodgrass. Bullish: Gordon Strachan has talked up his side's chances ahead of taking on world champions Germany . Young gun: Celtic's Callum McGregor has represented Scotland youth sides and is now in the senior squad . He's back: Goalkeeper Craig Gordon has been recalled, and will be pushing for the No 1 jersey . Celtic's Craig Gordon returns to the international fold to put pressure on Allan McGregor and David Marshall for the No 1 jersey while Stoke midfielder Charlie Adam misses out. But irrespective of what side he selects to face Joachim Low's team, Strachan believes his players have the wherewithal to withstand the demands of what is currently the most daunting fixture in international football. 'You find out your true character when you walk out on to the pitch but I don't have a problem with these guys' characters,' he said. The big match: Strachan has no fear going into the Germany vs Scotland clash at the Westfalenstadion . Golden goal: Mario Gotze volleys home against Argentina to win the World Cup for Germany . 'I have no worries about them at all, not one bit. 'I have no concerns about anyone's going to freeze or think it's too much for them. 'They're looking forward to it, the noise they'll hear in the background in that stadium. 'But they're not just excited about the occasion, they want to get a result. 'We'll go through all emotions as a player for this one – they'll get nervous, they'll get excited. 'But once you get on the field that determines how you are. 'Do we have what happened to Brazil (a 7-1 defeat in the World Cup semi) in our minds? No, not at all, because you can't afford to think like that.' Champions: Germany won the World Cup in Brazil, and are now looking to push on and win Euro 2016 . Celtic midfielder McGregor has gone from a loan player at Notts County to potentially a full Scotland international in the space of a year. And Strachan believes his selection is due reward for the player's decision to prove himself in the game when it would have been easier to stagnate at Lennoxtown. 'I like to have people who can eliminate people and go by them, and he has shown that,' he added. 'Not just this season, he has shown that last season at under-21 level and Notts County, which was great because he has done something about his career. 'He has got off his backside at Notts County. It's easy just to sit here. So I like that attitude. 'He has come back and now he is playing with Celtic and scoring goals, and going by people.' On top of the world: Gotze kisses the World cup trophy after scoring the winner in the final against Argentina . Strachan also heaped praise on Hull City's Andy Robertson who seems set to win his third cap and make the Scotland left-back slot his own just two years after plying his trade at Queen's Park. Robertson had to rehabilitate himself with the Spiders after his release by Celtic – and mixed playing football with selling programmes at Hampden. 'He's playing well,' Strachan said of the former Dundee United man. 'The boys loved him at QPR last week and I was speaking to someone who was playing at Hull yesterday and said he was terrific. 'He's another one who was selling programmes after being told he wasn't needed at Celtic. 'He dealt with that body blow and got on with it.'","Scotland face world champions Germany in Dortmund on September 7 .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Jenson Button has admitted feeling sorry for Lewis Hamilton after watching his former team-mate's Formula One world title hopes suffer a string of crushing blows. Button, though, does feel the battle for the championship has become 'spicy' following the warfare that has unfolded between Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton claimed, in a heated post-Belgian Grand Prix meeting, Rosberg said he opted not to avoid their lap-two collision to 'make a point'. Collision: Mercedes team-mates Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton collided in Belgium, ending Hamilton's race . It was an incident which ultimately ended Hamilton's race, with the Briton now 29 points adrift of Rosberg, who went on to finish second behind Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. Rosberg has since stated his version of events is 'very different' to Hamilton's, but has refused to elaborate, preferring to keep such matters 'internal'. Button has been left amazed by Hamilton's appalling run, with events on Sunday at Spa following his brake-disc failure in Germany and car fire in Hungary, both during qualifying at those races. 'I feel for Lewis, he was leading the race...It is unbelievable,' said Button, who partnered Hamilton at McLaren for three years from 2010-2012. 'I've never seen such bad luck, or misjudgement on other people's part, for Lewis to lose so many points over a period of races. Podium: The German driver went on to claim to second place, putting him 29 points ahead of Hamilton . 'It's astonishing, really. I've never seen that before, especially when you have a car that is so dominant and they should be first and second every race. 'It is just a matter of fighting it out and beating your team-mate, although I know that takes its toll. 'But for me Lewis has come across really well in the media after some disappointing races. 'He has definitely grown as an individual, which is good to see, and has taken it on the chin. 'Hopefully it will build his confidence for the rest of the season rather than shatter it.' The veteran 34-year-old has been left perplexed by Rosberg's attempt to overtake Hamilton, adding: 'There was nothing there. 'All there was was going off the circuit. There was no move. Strange. Fault: Jenson Button said Rosberg had no right to try and overtake Hamilton, and blamed him for the crash . VIDEO Ricciardo wins as Rosberg hits Hamilton . 'I think any driver would look at it now, and I am sure Nico will look at it and say, 'I don't know what was I thinking'. 'You should be able to judge situations like that a bit better.' Button, though, is relishing the rest of the campaign between the duo given what unfolded on and off track at Spa. 'It is a shame it is not a cleaner fight,' added Button. 'I've always said the person who wins the world championship this year is the person who does the best job on the circuit, but that does not quite seem the way it is at the moment. Matured: Button said Hamilton has 'grown as an individual' and praised his maturity this season . 'They (Mercedes and one of the their drivers) will still win the championships, but what has happened definitely adds spice to what is already a pretty spicy relationship. 'Is it good for the sport? It's negative because we didn't see a good battle between those two. 'But it does get everyone excited about the next grand prix in Italy where none of the fans will be cheering for either of them and would love a coming together. 'It adds spice, but it's a shame in that true racers want to see them fighting.'","Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg collided in Belgian Grand Prix .

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . The Life, Family and Freedom Conference, due to be held on Saturday August 30, is being run by Illinois-based organisation the World Congress of Families . A group of 80 conservative religious leaders have written an open letter to the people of Australia pleading for them to allow an anti-gay conference in Melbourne go ahead. The Life, Family and Freedom Conference, due to be held on Saturday August 30, has had its venue cancelled four times by venue owners and is scrambling to find a place that will host it. The 'pro natural family' conference is being run by Illinois-based organisation the World Congress of Families (WCF) and is sponsored by Australian Christian organisation Endeavour Forum. In the letter, 80 religion leaders from around the world blame a smear campaign launched by 'sexual radicals' for the repeated cancellation of the event. 'It is alleged that advocacy of the natural (or normative) family is somehow unfair to other families and that we “shame” single-parent families, homosexual “couples” and the divorced,' the letter reads. 'Yet social science data shows clearly and unequivocally that children do best in families with a mother and father.' Speakers listed on the event's brochure include Federal Minister for Social Services Kevin Andrews, Victorian Attorney-General Robert Clark and NSW Christian Democrats MP Reverend Fred Nile. Since 1997, WCF has held seven congresses in Prague, Geneva, Mexico City, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Madrid and Sydney in 2013 . Speakers on stage at the World Congress of Families in Madrid in 2012 . Also due to speak is controversial doctor Angela Lanfranchi from the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute who will give a talk on 'The link between abortion and breast cancer'. Earlier this month Senator Eric Abetz was slammed after he spoke on Channel Ten's The Project and appeared to back up Dr Lanfrachi's assertion that abortions lead to breast cancer by citing 1950s research. He later made a statement denying he had made the link, saying he had been 'cut off' before he could fully answer the question. A group of 80 conservative religious leaders have written an open letter to the people of Australia pleading for them to allow the anti-gay conference to go ahead . The WCF's open letter also states attacks on the Melbourne conference and the international pro-family movement are an attempt at 'intimidation'. 'The goal of sexual radicals is to deconstruct marriage and marginalize the family, and thus to transform society into something unrecognizable to generations past,' the letter says. Among the Australian signatories are Rabbi Dr Shimon Cowen, director of the Institute for Judaism and Civilization and Warwick March from the Dads4Kids Fatherhood Foundation. The conference was due to be held at St Patrick's Parish Hall in Mentone, south-east Melbourne, before venue owners cancelled due to concerns about the safety of the nearby school and church. It was then rescheduled to be held at St Cecilia's Hall in Glen Iris and Aurora Receptions in Brunswick but both venue owners also cancelled. Organisers said a fourth unnamed venue had also pulled out. 'It’s a mess,' Margaret Butts told Guardian Australia. 'We have no venue at the moment – the police are telling us it's a safety risk because of planned protests and demonstrations.' Simon Hunt, who runs the Pauline Pantsdown Facebook page, has been leading a social media campaign against the event. A 'Block Party Against Hate' is being also organised by protesters to take place outside the conference. 'There will be art and music, and lots of like-minded people celebrating inclusion and diversity,' the Facebook event page reads.

"By . Candace Sutton . and Emily Crane for Daily Mail Australia . A Christian missionary who allegedly tried to wrestle the controls from a young pilot mid-air, forcing an emergency landing, is a well-travelled pilot with 50 years of experience. Les Nixon, 82, is recovering in hospital after a 23-year-old pilot was forced to subdue him when he allegedly grabbed the controls of the four-seater Duchess light aircraft as they were flying over the Blue Mountains in NSW. A friend of Mr Nixon told Daily Mail Australia that his erratic behaviour was totally out of character and could offer no explanation why he would allegedly try and ditch the plane. Pilot James Chandler told police Mr Nixon started switching off fuel lines and pushing control buttons, forcing an emergency landing near Oberon, west of the Blue Mountains, on Monday afternoon. 'I can't even imagine what would have happened in that plane. It certainly comes as a surprise,' Mr Nixon's friend of 40 years, Phil Lamb, told Daily Mail Australia. 'It would have been very out of character for him to do anything that wasn't professional.' Scroll down for video . Pilot James Chandler, 23, had to make an emergency landing after an 82-year-old passenger allegedly switched off the fuel lines over the Blue Mountains in NSW on Monday . Les Nixon, pictured here with his wife Martha, was a Christian missionary with more than 50 years of flying experience. He was charged by police late on Wednesday following an investigation . Mr Nixon has been flying for 50 years to isolated corners of Australia as part of the Christian outreach program he started with his wife Martha, Australia's Outback Patrol. 'That Duchess he flew was his favourite plane. He knew that Duchess (plane) inside and out,' Mr Lamb said. 'He used to hire a twin engine out of Bankstown to maintain currency so that means he would have been familiar with every switch inside,' Mr Lamb said. A dramatic recording of the cockpit emergency revealed audio of the pilot struggling with Mr Nixon in the light plane as they flew over the Blue Mountains. 'Pan pan pan pan pan, bravo foxtrot papa, bravo foxtrot papa, my passenger is trying to take over,' Mr Chandler shouts into the aircraft's speaker, according to an Air Traffic Control recording obtained by the Nine Network. Mr Nixon, the sole passenger on the flight, had allegedly reached over to switch off the fuel supply to the plane's single engine and then tried to take control of the joystick, causing Mr Chandler to shout 'We... whoah, whoah. My passenger's taking... the engines.' A dramatic recording of the cockpit emergency revealed audio of the pilot struggling with Mr Nixon in the light plane as they flew over the Blue Mountains . Mr Chandler punched Mr Nixon repeatedly in the face to subdue him, breaking the 82-year-old's nose . Mr Nixon had chartered the flight - allegedly his first on a light plane - from Australian By Air to take him from the NSW Central Coast over the Blue Mountains to Cowra, 350km to the south-west. Mr Chandler punched Mr Nixon repeatedly in the face to subdue him, breaking the 82-year-old's nose. At the same time the pilot - who has just two years' flying experience - managed to shut off the craft's mechanics and glide it down at about 3pm on Monday into a flat paddock run with sheep on a property known as Bloomfield, near Oberon. Mr Lamb said he couldn't comment on his friend's health during the mid-air incident. 'He’s getting medical assessments and I guess when those are available, more will be discovered of his physical condition,' he said. 'Obviously, there’s speculation about what’s happened. But unless someone else was on board, it’s impossible for us to understand. 'There’s two sides to the story. There’s a young pilot who is relatively inexperienced and a pilot who has been flying for 50 years. Whether there has been a miscommunication, I guess that will be revealed in investigation.' Mr Nixon, 82, is recovering in hospital after the pilot was forced to subdue him when he allegedly grabbed the controls of the four-seater Duchess light aircraft in which they were airborne . Pilot James Chandler safely landed in a sheep paddock at Oberon, west of the Blue Mountains, where a Royal Australian Navy helicopter was first on the scene to come to his aid . NSW Police told Daily Mail Australia they were waiting for doctors at Westmead Hospital to clear Mr Nixon, who was admitted for facial injuries, so they could interview him and learn whether he meant to take control of the plane or whether he just panicked. 'The pilot's done really well to land the plane safely,' a NSW police officer said, 'with this bloke fiddling with the controls. It could have been much worse, a real disaster.' Australia By Air CEO, David Trevelyan, who said the elderly man was a first time customer with his company, told Nine News Mr Chandler's flying skills were paramount in avoiding a crash. 'I would like to praise the actions of the pilot. He showed fantastic skill,' Mr Trevelyan said. 'He did an excellent job in an amazingly difficult scenario ... and under tremendous pressure.' Mr Chandler was treated briefly in hospital before being released. Mr Nixon had headed the Australia's Outback Patrol program with his wife Martha since 1961. 'He was a lovely, fine man. He has had a 50 years long carer serving other people. He started a mission whose aim was to use the plane in isolated communities,' Mr Lamb said.","Les Nixon, 82, is a Christian missionary with more than 50 years flying experience .

A mother, only identified as Rachel, is seeking an apology from the school after the eldest of her two daughters came home and asked if she could no longer have male friends as suggested by the full-page newsletter article. Rachel told Mamamia the article contained advice many parents would consider 'archaic'. 'Parents already feel let down by the Catholic Church by its inability to keep up with the times, but are now concerned that in 2014 our children are being educated in this sexist and misogynistic environment,' she said. 'Kids in years one and two are reading it. It’s just bonkers in our country, in this day and age. 'I just think it’s not lending itself to a modern-day relationship, which is about communication and trust. That’s taking us back to the dark ages.' The article originally appeared on iMOM Family First and says porn is the 'cancer that's ruining the sex lives of countless married couples' and suggests married women should not talk about sex with members of the opposite sex. Father Johnson told the Herald Sun he had received positive feedback, but it had been far outweighed by those who were upset by it. 'It was intended to be helpful, it clearly has not been,' he said. But he 'utterly disagreed' that it was derogatory or sexist towards women. The school's deputy principal, Pat Berlingeri, said Father Johnson had the final say about what was published in his section of the newsletter.","St James Catholic school in Brighton, east of Melbourne, published the 'sexist and misogynistic' article on August 7 .

"By . Ruth Styles . A young couple who receive more than £17,000 a year in benefits appeared on ITV's This Morning to defend their taxpayer-funded lifestyle. Danny Creamer, 21, and Gina Allan, 18, who live in a comfortable two-bedroom flat in Portsmouth  with their four month old daughter, Talulah Rose, say they are better off on £17k benefits and argue that unless they are able to find jobs that pay £18,000 a year or more, there's no point in working. The couple also hit back at those who describe them as scroungers, arguing that because their hard-working parents have paid tax all their lives, they are entitled to claim some of the money back. Scroll down for video . Entitlement: Gina Allan and Danny Creamer say they are entitled to benefits because the Government wouldn't provide them if they didn't need them . Gina, who has worked for Sainsburys in the past said: 'I don’t see that we’re living off the taxpayers, we’re entitled to the money our parents paid all their lives.' She also claimed that because the pair have paid tax in the past, their daughter should also be entitled to claim benefits in future. 'We have paid into the system as well . and you know, if our daughter wants to claim when she's older, she can. We're not . going to claim benefits forever so we are going to pay into the system at some point.' The pair receive £1,473 per month in benefits or £17,680 per year. This works out at £340 per week, which includes £140 housing benefit, £60 child tax credit, £20 child benefit and £110 Jobseekers Allowance. Weekly outgoings include £60 on food, £22.50 on TV, £3.50 on their TV licence plus utility bills, which the pair say they receive no help with. According to Gina, their 47"" flat screen TV is their only luxury, although Danny also admits to smoking roll-up cigarettes which are also paid for by tax payers. Shocked: Hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby appeared shocked by the couples' comments . Angry: Radio presenter Nick Ferarri said he was angry with the system but felt some sympathy for the pair . Although neither have any . qualifications, Danny, who has also worked as a shelf stacker in the . past, says he is now looking for a job - although says he won't accept . any old role. 'What is the point [of a minimum wage job]? You know, I'm not going to go to work to be worse off.' he argued. Gina added: 'The main problem is is that the cost of living is going up so much but the wages are just the same. But people still expect you to live on the minimum wage - I don't think that's right.' Although Danny says he does intend to get a job, the pair say they will carry on living on benefits until Danny gets a job that pays enough or 'the system changes'. 'We'll carry on until the system changes if Danny doesn't get a job,' says Gina. Danny added: 'We can't be scroungers because the Government wouldn't give us the money or pay towards our living expenses . if we didn't need it.' Taxes: The duo say they are right to claim benefits because their parents have paid taxes all their lives . Unfortunately for Danny and Gina, the change in the system they so dread isn't far away. In a statement read out on This Morning, the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'We have to end the absurdity in the . welfare system where people are better off claiming benefits than they . are in work. 'Universal Credit will ensure that work will always pay and . people who can work will no longer be able to count on the state to fund . a life on benefits.' Asked what they intend to do when the new system is introduced, Gina quickly replied: 'He'd have to get a job I suppose.' LBC radio presenter and Sunday Express columnist, Nick Ferrari, who was present during the couple's appearance told them: 'What you two have done is a great shame. You've seen it as a lifestyle choice and it's something you choose to do. You shouldn't.'","Danny Creamer, 21, and Gina Allan, 18, receive £17,680 per year .

"By . Matt Chorley . and Tamara Cohen . Once, a certain senior Labour figure responded in pugilistic fashion to an egg-throwing protester. But Ed Miliband clearly isn’t cut from the same pugnacious cloth as John Prescott. When the Labour leader was hit on the back of the head yesterday, he simply laughed it off, saying he was ‘always looking for new ways to connect with voters’. A contrast indeed to the moment in 2001 when then deputy prime minister Mr Prescott lashed out with a left hook after being egged by a countryside campaigner. Yesterday’s sticky moment came as Mr Miliband attempted to use a walkabout at a market to attack the Government over the rising cost of living. Scroll down for video . Yolks on him: The contents of the eggs splattered over passersby and journalists after cracking on Ed Miliband's head . Splat: Ed Miliband is hit on the head by an egg during a visit to South East London's East Street Market . Joke: Mr Miliband sought to laugh off the latest egging with this message posted on Twitter . But his attempt to answer critics who . claim he was failing to connect with voters backfired when six eggs . rained down on his head. It is not the first time Mr Miliband has been hit by an egg - he was struck in a similar protest in May 2012 while on the campaign trail in Southampton. The Labour leader has been stung by criticism that his party has been silent for the last three weeks, while the coalition has set the political agenda. His visit to the south London's East Street Market was his first return to the frontline since his summer holiday in France. But as he tried to convince shoppers he had a plan to help people who are feeling the pinch, he was struck by several eggs. He later wrote on Twitter: 'Thanks to all at East St Market for the warm welcome today. Can recommend it for easy availability of eggs.' Scotland Yard said Mr Miliband did not want police to take the matter further. Setback: Mr Miliband had hoped to focus on a claim that the government is 'out of touch' instead of wiping egg out of his hair . Message: Labour hoped to turn the tables on the government, with wage increases outstripped by the rising cost of living . The man who threw the six eggs was . 38-year-old Dean Porter, who was homeless for five years and said he had . travelled to the street specifically to target Mr Miliband. As he threw the eggs he joked that he would only have voted for Mr Miliband's brother, David. Speaking . to reporters after the incident, Mr Porter said: 'They don't care about . the poor, they just care about the banks, they should stop giving . favouritism to the banks. 'The government do nothing, the shadow government do nothing. If you're poor you're considered a burden.' After the incident he was led away from the scene by market security. Protest: Dean Porter, pictured throwing the eggs, said he was protesting at the way the poor are treated by both the government and the opposition . Two jabs: Prescott lands a left hook on a countryside campaigner who egged him during 2001 . Mr Miliband said: 'This is not the first time it's happened to me, I'm sure it's not the last,"" he said. ""I'm always looking for new ways to connect with the voters.' A surprise new poll this week showed David Cameron and George Osborne have almost doubled their lead over Labour for stewardship of the economy. According to the ICM/Guardian survey, 40 per cent . believe the Prime Minister and Chancellor are more capable of managing . the economy than Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. Just 24 per cent said the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor have the right answers – giving the Tories a 16 per cent lead. It is a dramatic increase from a lead . of just nine points last month, and sent shockwaves through the . Labour party as Mr Miliband prepares for another relaunch. Mr Miliband has faced calls to beef up his team to take on a resurgent Tory party. Blairites called on him to recall Labour’s ‘grown-ups’ to frontline politics . as he was accused of lacking a ‘coherent’ economic policy. Former . minister Chris Mullin said the Labour leader should recall big beasts . such as former Cabinet ministers Alistair Darling and Alan Johnson to . help rescue the party. He said Mr Miliband needs ‘a strong, coherent case’ and ‘a credible message’. Grownups: Many in the Labour party would like to see Alistair Darling (left) and Alan Johnson return to the frontbench . Describing them as ‘grown-ups’ he . said on Radio 4 that Mr Darling was ‘a very good chancellor and still is . a very credible witness on the economy’ and Mr Johnson was ‘an . immensely credible figure’. Mr Mullin said Labour needed to . counter the ‘vast lie’ that Britain’s economic problems were primarily . caused by the previous government. He said the ‘only thing’ the party had to apologise for was not ‘regulating the banks sufficiently’. Former spin doctor Alastair Campbell also demanded that Mr Miliband get on the front foot over the economy. In a blog on his website, Mr Campbell . wrote: ‘The very good record of the last Labour government has been . blunted if not lost as a political weapon. Labour must be more robust in . defending the record, including the Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling . handling of the global financial crisis.’ Former minister Tony McNulty also . said: ‘If we have little confidence defending [our] record, why should . anyone believe our forward offer?’ Mr Miliband has spent the last three weeks on holiday, sparking unease in Labour ranks about the deafening silence of his frontbench. With signs the economy is recovering, a growing list of MPs and advisers have warned Labour needs to up its game. Gordon Brown's former pollster Deborah . Mattinson warned that Labour was ‘slightly lurching from one announcement to the next, or complete silence’. ‘What . voters need to hear is some real clarity about what Labour stands for, . what Labour believes, how Labour now would be different from how Labour . has been before. And that needs to be set out with absolute clarity in a . language that people understand.' It comes after shadow health secretary Andy Burnham complained that Labour must 'shout louder and speak in a way that captures how people are feeling and thinking'. Economic competence: The Tory lead over Labour for running the economy has soared from nine points in June to 16 points in August . PM David Cameron, left, and Chancellor George . Osborne, right, have seen a sharp rise in their economic credibility, . according to the survey . Veteran backbenchers George Mudie and Graham Stringer have also warned Mr Miliband;s policies are 'confused'. However . Tom Harris, who stood down from the Labour frontbench this year, . likened Mr Miliband to Margaret Thatcher and insisted he was a 'ruthless . b******' with the grit to win. 'The . kind of steel within Ed Miliband is what the Tories needed nearly 40 . years ago and it's what our party needed in 2010. We still need it . today. And by 2015 we’ll need it more than ever,' he wrote in an article . for the Telegraph. From April to June the economy grew by 0.6 per cent, double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first quarter of 2013. New . Bank of England governor Mark Carney last week raised growth forecasts . for this year from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from . 1.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Senior Tories have been careful not to declare they can see ‘green shoots’ of recovery, with Mr Osborne insisting the economy has moved only from ‘repair to recovery’. With growth up and unemployment down, Labour has been forced to re-rite its attacks on the government, having previously accused ministers of cutting ‘too far, too fast’. Pressure: After three weeks of almost complete silence from the Labour leadership, the poll will be another blow for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls (right) Mr Miliband's frontbench have instead claimed that the recovery is only being enjoyed by the wealthy. But the new message has done nothing to stop voters swinging in behind the Tory leadership’s economic strategy. According . to the latest ICM survey for the Guardian, the Conservative lead for . ‘competence’ on the economy is at its highest level since December 2012. To make things worse for Labour, the same survey shows that while the party is ahead overall, it is only just. On . voting intentions Mr Miliband’s party leads by just 3 per cent, with 35 . per cent saying they will vote Labour compared with 32 per cent for the . Conservatives. Factoring in the margin of error – of plus or minus 3 per cent – shows that the lead may in fact be non-existent. The Tories have fallen four points over the last month and Labour has gone down 1 per cent. The . poll is the latest blow for Mr Miliband, who is expected to return to . the political fray this week with an attack on the government for . falling wages in real terms. He has faced criticism for three weeks of all but total silence from his frontbench, leaving the coalition to set the political agenda. A much-hyped speech on immigration by frontbencher Chris Bryant turned into a fiasco when large sections attacking Tesco and Next had to be rewritten after the retail giants hit back at errors in pre-briefed extracts. The ICM poll shows UKIP has seen its rating rise from 7 to 10 per cent. The poll also shows 17 per cent of people think their personal financial circumstances have improved in the last year, compared to 43 per cent who say it has become worse. A quarter believed their situation would improve in the next year.","Ed Miliband hit with eggs during market visit to reconnect with voters .

"By . James Andrew for MailOnline . Follow @@JamesAndrew_ . Felix Magath claims he is the only man to lead Fulham back to the Premier League, despite seeing his winless start in the Championship extend to five games. The German manager was met with cries of ‘out, out, out’ at the final whistle as Kenywne Jones levelled for Cardiff after Tim Hoogland had given Fulham the lead in the first half. Close encounter: Fulham and Cardiff played out a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage . Equaliser: Kenwyne Jones celebrates with Cardiff team-mate Fabio da Silva after levelling the scoring . Under pressure: Felix Magath will be hoping his side improves after the international break . Fulham: Bettinelli 6.5, Voser 6, Burn 6, Bodurov 6, Stafylidis 6, David 6.5 (Dembele 75 6), Hoogland 7, Parker 7.5 (Eisfeld 83), Hyndman 6, Woodrow 6 (Chihi 60 6), McCormack 7.5 .

Goal: Jones 55 . Attendance: 17, 508 . Referee: James Adcock 5 . But Magath, whose side are second from bottom, remained defiant and still believes he is the right man for Fulham. ‘It is a difficult situation and I understand the fans who are afraid,’ Magath said. ‘Last season we were relegated and this season we are towards the bottom. I am not glad about it, but we have made changes and it was necessary for the club. ‘I have a lot of young players in the team and I know that is a problem and I live with this problem. ‘But don’t just look at the results, look at what I have done for the club. I have taken six players out of the academy. ‘I am trying to bring the players from the academy to the Premier League, I am the right man to do it. No one else. I am not the Special One, I am the only one.’ Fulham put in their best performance of the season in the opening 45 minutes and took the lead midway through the first half. Battling for possession: Fulham goalscorer Tim Hoogland tries to win the ball back from Mats Daehli . Big-money signing Ross McCormack combined with Scott Parker and crossed for Hoogland, whose glancing header flew past David Marshall. Fulham were in the ascendancy after the goal and had two good chances to extend their lead from free kicks through Dutch midfielder Chris David — but he over-hit both of them. Magath added: ‘It was a very good first half, it was the best performance of the season. I was disappointed not to score more goals. We played well and had chances. But it happens all the time, you can be playing well but if you not scoring then you concede a goal then they sat back and made it very difficult.’ Fulham were made to pay for their missed chances early in the second half when Jones fired Cardiff level.

Peter Wittingham launched a long ball to Jones, who played a neat one-two with Mats Daehli before beating the offside trap and firing past Marcus Bettinelli.

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Roy Hodgson has told Premier League clubs to forget about pulling players out of England duty just because they are tired. International football returns to England next week and public interest in the national side is at its lowest ebb for many years. As a result of England's miserable World Cup campaign, as few as 35,000 fans could be at Wembley to watch the Three Lions take on Norway in a friendly. Warning: England manager Roy Hodgson insists his players cannot use international breaks as rests . But even though the public are not interested in the match, or the qualifier against Switzerland five days later, top-flight clubs and the England players they have on their books should not view the upcoming international get together as a holiday, Hodgson insists. Whenever Hodgson has to choose a squad, he wants his players fully focused when they report for duty, and he feels it should not fall upon his shoulders to rest players if they start to fatigue. 'The players can't regard the international breaks as the unofficial winter break, like a lot of club teams do, they have to accept it,' the England manager said. 'The national team plays seven, eight or nine games a year. I think we should have the right to accept that those players are going to be available and play for us and if they need a rest then I think it might be incumbent upon the clubs to give them one.' Hodgson insists Wayne Rooney's appointment as England captain will not lead to burnout for the 28-year-old. Rooney was appointed Manchester United captain just over a fortnight ago, but Hodgson says the striker will not have too much extra work to do with England now that he is skipper of the national team too. 'Being captain won't affect his work load,' Hodgson said. 'Nothing more will be asked for him. He will have to sit beside me at press conferences. Rest: Hodgson says Premier League managers cannot treat international weeks as 'unofficial winter breaks' 'If it was necessary to leave a player out we could, but we have started to create an environment here where the players actually won't want to sit out.' With Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole having retired, Rooney is by far the most experienced member of the 22-man squad selected for the upcoming double-header. The second most experienced player in the party is James Milner, the 48-cap midfielder who cannot hold down a regular first-team place at Manchester City. Despite the lack of leaders available to him, Hodgson is optimistic about the next two years. The former Liverpool manager insists England will qualify for Euro 2016 - although that is not hard given that the top two teams from each group qualify automatically - and he is confident his team will put on a good show in the tournament its self. The 67-year-old has cited Germany's recovery from mediocrity to World champions as a reason for optimism. 'I am not prepared to approach this with doom and gloom,' he said. Hodgson knows he must not let the disappointment of England's World Cup campaign linger if he is to drag the team out of the gutter though. 'I must not allow the fact that those results went badly to totally blast out of the water all the things we want to do,' added Hodgson, who said England's early elimination in Brazil was down to 'fine margins'. 'The players have to make certain they can't allow the negativity to impact upon them or it will ruin their chances. New start: England may face Norway at Wembley on Wednesday night with less than 35,000 fans . 'You have to be mentally strong and deal with it, because we can't turn the clock back.' Hodgson is yet to make his mind up whether he is interested in managing England beyond the summer of 2016, when his contract expires. Only an impressive European Championship would lead to a public clamour for him to remain, and in two years' time he will be 12 months shy of his 70th birthday. That said, there is hardly a stellar list of English candidates out there waiting in the wings. Hodgson will not make a decision on his future for some time, though, it seems. 'I haven't given that a thought at the moment,' he said. 'I have to make sure at the end of my contract that I am not looking in the mirror and saying 'I wish I had done something different'. 'In 2016 who knows what will happen. Maybe I will want to continue, maybe they (the FA) won't want me, maybe i will want to retire.'","Roy Hodgson will not allow players off England duty because they are tired .

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . It's a case of spot the difference between Australia's poster promoting the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup and the other competing countries. The 'I root for' slogan is emblazoned across the other 23 teams' promotional material but Australia's poster was wisely changed to 'I support Australia' for the World Cup championship that runs for the next two weeks in Spain. Although 'rooting' is a term widely used across the globe to imply you support or follow a particular team or country in sport, the word is more commonly used as a slang word among Aussies for having sex. Using the word 'support' was the better option for Australia instead of 'root' like the other 23 posters . One of the 23 posters that have the slogan ' I ROOT FOR' Americans very commonly used the term 'root' to talk about their support for a team . The change was made after Basketball Australia suggested FIBA alter the marketing material in question to suit the Australian market. 'Given the connotations of the original slogan – we think basketball is exciting enough as it is without other activities on top,' a Basketball Australian spokesperson said. The alteration of the poster started a debate on Reddit with some thinking the Aussie term should have been changed to 'barrack'. 'If they understood Australian slang it would be 'I barack (sic) for Australia' one said. Another replied suggesting that 'barrack' was only a Victorian term while others chimed in saying the word was also used in NSW, Perth and Adelaide. Some Aussies think the word 'barrack' should have been used instead of 'support' Then the conversation went onto whether barrack was used across the country . Then someone suggested it was an old-fashioned term: 'I've heard it rarely and it was mostly other people saying it'. 'I think it's Australia wide....but is slowly falling out of fashion an some areas are just hanging onto it longer,' another posted. But others thought 'barrack' was only used in the football code of AFL which was originally known as the VFL and only played in Victoria. 'I have a suspicion it's just an AFL thing. I've never heard someone say they barrack for their team unless they're talking about Vickers.' New Zealand don't seem to have a problem with using the 'I root' slogan . Some suggested that 'barrack' was just possibly an AFL term . Others thought it was simply an old-fashioned word that was dying out .","All 23 countries except Australia have the poster slogan 'I root for' to promote the FIBA Basketball World Cup .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Openly-gay carpenter Nate Duivenvoorden will be the only transgender man playing . Melbourne carpenter Nate Duivenvoorden looks every bit your ordinary rugby player - well built with a stocky frame and even the skills to boot. But the 30-year-old man - who once cut a much slender figure as a female teenager - is anything but. Before becoming a man Mr Duivenvoorden was finding it difficult to cope as a female and said the transformation was the best but 'hardest decision' of his life. The openly-gay rugby union player, who will lineup in this weekend's world cup of gay rugby in Sydney, began his transformation half way through his life in the early 2000s. 'The hardest part of the whole process was making the decision to transition,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'As soon as I made that decision it lifted an enormous weight off my shoulders...I rang my mum and I said I need a new name.' After making the decision to become a transgender he then underwent years of hormone replacement therapy. The Melbourne Chargers player was just a teenager when he underwent surgery to become a man . Playing for his club side the Melbourne Chargers in the Bingham Cup, Mr Duivenvoorden will be the only transgender representative playing. Named after gay rugby player Mark Bingham, the competition recognises equal rights in sport and will bring a whole host of international representatives to Sydney to play. Mr Bingham died in the September 11, 2001 attacks on United Airlines 93 that crashed in Pennsylvania after being hijacked by terrorists. He was believed to have been one of four men who attempted to take the plane back from the terrorists, preventing the plane crashing into its intended target - the White House. Mark was the original member of one of the first gay rugby teams in the world, the San Francisco Fog. Mr Duivenvoorden said that he hopes the tournament, as a legacy to Mr Bingham, will encourage others to play the sport or open-up about their sexuality. 'There's nothing to be ashamed of,' he said. 'You should be confident, you should be proud,' he said, adding that the support of his club has firmed up the belief that you can be both. Nate Duivenvoorden, (with the ball), said rugby provides a good support network for people who are gay . The Bingham Cup was name in honour of Mark Bingham who was an openly gay American rugby player that died on a plane hijacked by terrorists . He said his self esteem has received a major boost since taking up the sport as a man and he is helping to combat stereotypes. Australian Rugby Union CEO Bill Pulver made a commitment in April that the Australian Rugby would resolve to eliminate discrimination in Rugby. He joined the leaders of other sporting codes to sign a collective commitment to stamp out homophobia in each of their respective sports. 'We’ve worked with a number of stakeholders to develop our Inclusion Policy - mostparticularly, the organisers of the 2014 Bingham Cup, who were instrumental in putting aframework together earlier this year,' Pulver said. The organisers of Bingham Sydney 2014 have been directly involved in the ARU’s decision to announce the policy and will also be directly involved in development of the policies detail. The Bingham Cup is on from August 29 to 31.","Nate Duivenvoorden was born female but underwent surgery in early 2000s .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . As the parents of a newborn Kylie and Michael Ramm expected to endure sleepless nights. After putting baby Phyllisity to sleep each night, the couple take it in turns to watch over her, terrified she might stop breathing. They are not paranoid new parents. They have been scarred by repeatedly having to resuscitate their daughter, who stops breathing 20 times a night. The eight-month-old has a condition, rare in babies, called obstructive sleep apnoea. Scroll down for video . Baby Phyllisity Ramm, pictured with her mother Kylie, has a condition called obstructive sleep apnoea, causing her airways to collapse and become blocked when she sleeps. The eight-month-old can stop breathing up to 20 times a night . It causes the walls of Phyllisity's throat to relax and narrow while she sleeps, blocking her airway and stopping her breathing. The exhausted couple are now desperate to get a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine on the NHS, to help Phyllisity. It is widely regarded as the most effective treatment for the serious problem, stopping the patient's throat from closing while they sleep. But the Ramms said they are facing an uphill battle to convince doctors to give them the equipment. Doctors at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital are in the process of performing a series of vital tests to decide on the best course of treatment for the eight-month-old. The 26-year-old, from Dereham, Norfolk, said: 'I don’t think it is right that a mother should have to perform CPR on her own baby. 'She goes limp and blue within seconds and I have to pick her up straightaway - and if she doesn’t start breathing on her own I have to intervene. 'Phyllisity has been blue-lighted up to hospital in an ambulance so many times I have lost count.' The mother-of-three, said: 'It is frightening for the whole family. Phyllisity's parents, Kylie and Michael, take it in turns to stay awake throughout the night to ensure they spot when their daughter stops breathing. They repeatedly have to resuscitate her in the night . The couple, from Dereham in Norfolk, are urging doctors to give Phyllisity a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine to help their daughter breathe at night. Doctors at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital are in the process of carrying out a series of tests to determine the best course of treatment for the eight-month-old . Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing. Many people suffering OSA will experience episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea. People with OSA are likely to suffer repeated episodes throughout the night. While suffering an episode, the lack of oxygen triggers the brain to pull a person out of deep sleep allowing them to breathe normally again. In adults, being obese or overweight, can cause OSA. People with a larger neck, or an unusual shaped neck with a narrowed airway, large tonsils or tongue can be more prone to the condition. Smoking and drinking alcohol can also induce an episode of sleep apnoea. OSA is relatively common, affecting more men than women. Most cases are detected between the ages of 30 and 60, but the condition can affect people of all ages, including children. There are various treatments, including lifestyle changes for those who are overweight, smokers or drink heavily. A continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device can help prevent the airway from closing while a sufferer sleeps, by delivering a continuous supply of compressed air through a mask. Source: NHS Choices . 'Joseph is only two and he hates the sound of sirens because he thinks they are coming to take his mum and sister away.' The couple have put a strict rota system in place so that one of them is awake around the clock to watch Phyllisity. Mrs . Ramm has to snatch a few hours sleep in the evening when her husband, . 27, gets home from his job at the Norwich & Peterborough Building . Society in Dereham. Then when he goes to bed the mother-of-three gets up and stays awake all night until she can grab another couple of hours in the morning before her husband returns to work. 'We are literally ships that pass in the night,' said Mrs Ramm. 'Every day is a real battle.' She is hoping that highlighting her daughter’s affliction will raise awareness and strengthen her case for a CPAP trial. The 26-year-old is gathering support from around the world on Twitter and Facebook and even the band The Hoosiers are following Phyllisity’s progress. 'We have been battling for eight months to get some answers and make progress with Phyllisity’s condition so I can’t see how it will hurt to have a CPAP trial,' Mrs Ramm said. 'If that doesn’t work at least we will know and we can try something else. 'She is not likely to grow out of it so we can’t go on like this for ever. 'Phyllisity is such a happy baby, always smiling and making us laugh. 'We love her so much and just want what’s best for all of our children.' A Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital spokesman said they were carrying out a raft of vital tests on Phyllisity. He said: 'We are working closely with the family and the regional specialist centre to complete the necessary clinical tests as soon as possible. 'The results will allow us to offer this young patient the best treatment.' Video courtesy of Howcast .","Phyllisity Ramm has a condition called obstructive sleep apnoea .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The woodpecker’s brain can withstand repeated collisions when it rapidly pecks at a tree looking for food - and now scientists think they know why. The bird avoids brain injury, despite the repeated high-speed impacts, because of the unique structure of its skull and beak, which reduces the impact on the brain. Chinese scientists have found that its body stores 99 per cent of energy from impacts as strain energy - the energy stored by an object which changes temporarily because of an applied force. The woodpecker avoids brain injury - despite the repeated impacts sustained by pecking at trees - because of the structure of its skull and beak, which reduces the impact on the brain. Scientists measured the stress at different times during pecking. (a) and (e) are moments of readiness to peck, (b) and (d) are moments of departure and return and (c) marks the moment of collision. Arrows on the beaks show velocity direction. It is clear the high levels of impact (shown in red) spread though the bird's body after a collision . Experts are interested in how the woodpecker protects its brain and body from shock and vibrations because it could help develop anti-shock devices and structures, which could be used in next-generation, spacecraft, cars and protective clothing. Dr Wu from the Dalian University of Technology said that spacecraft face the constant danger of collisions with space debris, which can be expensive and can put lives at risk. Scientists could design anti-shock materials inspired by the structure of a woodpecker, to dissipate the energy created by an impact from one spot and spread it across a larger area to reduce damage. New materials could also make car crashes less violent, which could reduce the number of people suffering severe head injuries in collisions. Experts are interested in how the . woodpecker protects its brain and body from shock and vibrations because . it could help develop anti-shock devices and structures, which could be . used in next-generation, spacecraft, cars and protective clothing. Engineers at the State Key Lab of Structural Analysis for Industrial Equipment, which is part of the Department of Engineering Mechanics at the Dalian University of Technology in north eastern China, found that the woodpecker’s body works as an excellent anti-shock structure by absorbing energy from impacts. Woodpeckers can peck trees at a high . frequency – up to 25Hertz - and at high speeds equivalent to seven metres per . second without suffering any brain injury. The force of the bird's pecking is equivalent to 1,000 times the force of gravity - the same as a human striking their head against a wall at a speed of 16 miles (25km) an hour with each peck. Woodpeckers (pictured) can peck trees at a high frequency - up to 25Hz - and at high speeds without suffering any brain injury . In the study, scientists made 3D computer models of a woodpecker and used programmes to understand how its anti-shock body structure distributes the energy from impacts. Dr Wu Chengwei and his team used CT scans of the bird to build their 3D computer model. ‘Based on the CT scanning technology, detailed inner structure images of the head were obtained and then imported to Mimics software to form a scattered-points model,’ they explained. More programmes were used to finish the geometric model, which was used to test how impact energy was handled by its specially adapted structure. ‘Most of the impact energy in the pecking is converted into the strain energy stored in the body (99.7 per cent) and there is only a small fraction of it in the head (0.3 per cent),’ the researchers said. Structures in the head included the beak and the the hyoid bone which further reduce the strain energy of the brain. The small fraction of impact energy that enters the brain will eventually dissipate in the form of heat, causing a rapid temperature increment in the brain. This is why the woodpecker has to peck intermittently and take short breaks. The findings of the study, published in the journal Science China Technological Science, could be used to design anti-shock devices and structures, which could be used in next-generation, spacecraft, cars and protective clothing. ‘High-speed impacts and collisions can destroy structures and materials,’ Dr Wu said. ‘In the aerospace industry, spacecraft face the constant danger of collisions with space debris and micrometeoroids.’ ‘If a spacecraft's structure or scientific instruments were destroyed by impact, the economic loss would be huge.’ 'In cities worldwide, car accidents are a persistent threat to human safety and head injuries are common so there is a real need for new anti-shock materials.' Experts are so interested in how the woodpecker protects its body from shock and vibrations, so they can learn lessons from nature in order to design better cars, for example, that can endure high-velocity impacts.

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . It could be one of the biggest crowdfunding hits in history. The Sense sleep monitoring system can look at not only how you sleep, but also everything from noise to light in your bedroom. It was launched earlier this month on Kickstarter - and is set to end its campaign having raised $2.5m. Scroll down for video . The system is controlled by a smart 'orb' that can monitor your bedroom and listen for loud noises or bright lights. Sense's Sleep Score takes into account all of the sensor data and variables that it monitors to generate a score out of a 100 for your previous night. It looks at both the environment of your bedroom, such as disturbances during the night, or your room was too bright for an ideal nights rest, as well as how you actually slept yourself. A pitch black room might boost your score by +10, but a car alarm going off repeatedly might lower it -20. The Sense app will give owners a breakdown and will also look for patterns, and help you to fix whatever is preventing people from reaching 100 per cent each night. 'It feels like a long time ago now, but just over 24 days ago I wrote about how we all felt at Hello after reaching over one million dollars in pledges after just four days,' James Proud, the inventor of the gadget wrote on the firm's Kickstarter page. 'It feels surreal that we have now doubled that to over two million dollars in pledges,' said Prund, who grew up in South London and is now based in San Francisco.. 'Never in our wildest dreams did we expect this and in such a short amount of time,' he previously wrote. The Sense system produces a sleep score for each night - and even work out if the neighbour's dog barked at 4AM. 'We spend a third of our lives asleep, and the rest of our time is completely dictated by how we slept - everything from how we eat to how we exercise,' James Proud, the 22-year-old Londoner behind the project told MailOnline. He claims the current rash of sleep monitoring products are flawed. The Pebble Watch, a smartwatch developed by Pebble Technology. Smartwatch Pebble (right) raised $10.3m from 68,929 backers in May 2012, making it the most popular Kickstarter campaign ever. Fledgling console maker Ouya raised $8.6m from 63,416 backers in August 2012 for its Android-based 'microconsole' Neil Young's Pono music player and downloads store attracted $6.2m of pledges earlier this year. Oculus Rift raised $2.4m from 9,522 backers in September 2012 - before being sold earlier this year for $2bn to Facebook. 'It's been a neglected area, but now there are a lot of apps and wearables that track our sleep. 'However, they don't seem to work too well. 'When you look at everything else, people aren't looking at why you sleep badly.' The sense system has two components. A main control 'orb' sits on the bedside table, and is packed with sensors to monitor everything from noise to light. It also has a speaker to play white noise, or play an alarm in the morning. The app shows readings over time - so can work out what temperature you sleep best at, for instance (left). It also gives a sleep score (right) that takes into account all the factors of your night's rest. A second gadget dubbed the 'sleep pill' clips onto the pillow to track movement through the night. Two can be used at the same time, allowing a couple to monitor their sleep independently - and the system can even tell which of them is snoring to keep the other awake. Proud says the key to the system is that it doesn't require users to clip on wearable gadgets of put their phone in a certain place. The orb stays on the bedside cabinet, while a second sensor clips to the inside of a pillow, meaning the user does not have to put on any gadgets before going to sleep at night. 'It can unobtrusively track sleep - you should have to think about it, you should just go to bed. 'Bedroom is key - but room we look at least.

Temperature and Humidity Sensors are able to detect the temperature and humidity throughout the day . A particulate Sensor can pollen and other material that triggers allergies. The second sensor, the sleep pill, has accelerometers to detect the slightest movement, and is left clipped to your pillow. It tells the orb how you are sleeping. The app tells you how well you slept, or didn’t, by giving you a Sleep Score each night, and analysing the historic data to work out what temperatures and humidities you sleep best at. 'There are all these environmental factors, but we are in the dark about them.' 'We can see what's happening when you're asleep - are there loud noises, are you sleep talking, for instance.' The system is controlled by an app. The system also has a smart alarm that can wake users up at the right time so they are most rested . 'You can see two main views - a breakdown of the revious night's sleep, but also a pre-sleep test that shows a live output from the data telling you historical patterns, so what temperature you sleep best at, for instance,' said Proud. There is also a 'smart alarm' that  wake you in the morning at the right point in your sleep cycle, which experts claim avoids the 'groggy' feeling in the morning.","Sensor sits on bedside table, listens for loud noise and monitors air and light quality .

The Brazil-born Spain international took his tally to four in three matches after his £32million move from Atletico Madrid with two in the frenetic 6-3 win at Everton. Costa's goals helped his former side to the Spanish title last season after he got off to a rapid start with 10 in eight successive wins from the off. Twelve months on Costa shows no signs of slowing down despite the hamstring problems which disrupted the end of his campaign.

Perfect start: Costa compares Chelsea's unbeaten start to Atletico Madrid on their way to the La Liga title . 'We have started really well and it is always good to have a great start,' he said. 'Last year we did the same and now this year too. 'It is nice to score goals but for me the most important thing is the team wins but I am happy I scored and helped the team win. 'Our team is a great team, it is really important to achieve great things and I am really happy to be here.' Costa scored in the first minute - after just 35 seconds - and the last, in between which were sandwiched efforts from Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic and Ramires in addition to a Seamus Coleman own goal. Kevin Mirallas, Steven Naismith and, against the club he left in the summer, Samuel Eto'o made it 2-1, 3-2 and 4-3 respectively but Chelsea always just kept one step ahead. 'It was nice to score my first goal (for the club) because on this ground it is always difficult, although the most important thing is we got three points,' said midfielder Matic. Solid return: Costa's opening three Premier League matches have brought four goals . 'This season we play better, we have more goals in us, we are more confident in attack - we scored six goals which is not easy. 'It was very good for people who bought tickets for the game as they saw nine goals, which is good for football and the Premier League. 'If every game was like this I'd be happy but the coach will show us where we made mistakes.' The coach in question, Jose Mourinho, has many examples to show them on Monday morning after expressing his dissatisfaction with how they defended.

'I prefer to win 6-0 playing fantastic football, defensively and offensively, but I want the team to play the way we did, I want them to be positive but not make defensive mistakes.' Everton manager Roberto Martinez will have a whole DVD of errors to show his shell-shocked squad with their defensive confidence in tatters after conceding 10 goals in three matches. The Spaniard admits fear has crept into their game and he will have to work hard to stop it. 'We started the game very uncharacteristically for us,' he said. 'We didn't have that defensive intensity and focus you have to have, especially with a team like Chelsea, and then we were chasing the game.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . From ski slopes to bike trails, tiny cameras such as GoPro, seem to be everywhere. But far from showing an exhilarating experience, their shaky footage can sometimes prove to be nauseating. Now computer scientists believe they have come up with a solution: a 'hyperlapse' that provide a smooth ride through the landscape no matter how jerky the original footage. Scroll down for videos . A trio of computer scientists believe they have come up with a solution to make GoPro videos less shaky: a 'hyperlapse' that provide a smooth ride through the landscape no matter how jerky the original video . The technology is the brainchild of Microsoft Research's Johannes Kopf, Michael Cohen, and Richard Szeliski. Their software creates a 3D map of the original footage, and then recreates the shots on what they describe as a 'novel camera path'. This novel camera path is found by analysing each frame of the video for ones that link together smoothly. The algorithm then connects these 'smooth points' and generates a time-lapsed video within those frames. The software creates a 3D map of the original footage shot on the video. Next, it analyses each frame of the video for ones that link together smoothly. It then connects these 'smooth points' together, and generates a time-lapsed video within those frame . The result is a smooth, jerk-free video that doesn't make you want to vomit. The Washington-based team have released two videos to show exactly how it works, with raw footage played alongside the time lapsed version. The project is due to be part of SIGGRAPH 2014, a Vancouver conference later this month held to showcase computer graphics techniques. The system is currently a research project and there are no existing plans to commercialise the software. The group is also working on making the Hyperlapse algorithm work as a Windows app, but they said it will likely be some time until that happens. If you've ever wanted to recreate a cinema in your living room, or turn your bedroom into a karaoke bar, Microsoft has the answer. Its SurroundWeb prototype beams screens from a computer on to the walls of a room, including browser tabs, maps, documents, videos and photos. The system uses small projectors and sensors to scan the layout of a room, including furniture, objects and people, to make sure the web pages aren't distorted. It also uses a Kinect camera to map mouse clicks to hand gestures. This means users can hold their hand over the position of a link on the wall and if they mimic pushing it, the SurroundWeb system recognises it as mouse click. Examples given by Microsoft Research include videos being projected from a PC onto a large wall, karaoke lyrics displayed above a music video playing on a TV screen, or a photo of a window being used in place of a wall.","The software creates a 3D map of the original footage shot on the video .

"By . Nick Purewal, Press Association . Gus Poyet has warned Sunderland to heed their Loftus Road 'wake-up call' in the international break to jump-start their Barclays Premier League campaign. The Black Cats are still searching their first league win of the new season after slipping up 1-0 against QPR on Saturday. Charlie Austin fired the hosts' first goal of the new term, denying Poyet's men the chance to get off the league win mark. Decisive: Charlie Austin scored the only goal of the game to give QPR all three points . Not happy: Poyet says his side need to improve after a slow start to the Premier League season . A frustrated Poyet lambasted Sunderland's defensive lapses and profligacy in possession, admitting he will take his squad to task ahead of their next league clash, at home to Tottenham on September 13. 'To lose that control and momentum, in those 15 minutes before the break; they made us suffer,' he said. 'It's got to be a wake-up call for us really. There's no place for this. 'We put ourselves under pressure, giving the ball away cheaply in our own half.' Adam Johnson produced two perfectly weighted through-balls for Patrick van Aanholt and Steven Fletcher as Sunderland took the early initiative at QPR. Under pressure: Sebastian Larsson goes down under a challenge as Sunderland failed to convert chances . Both men failed to provide a finish to match the approach play, however, and the Wearsiders paid the ultimate price in defeat. Austin blasted home just before half-time to break the deadlock, and despite several further half-chances Sunderland were unable to claim any points. Poyet is still chasing several new recruits ahead of Monday night's transfer deadline, to add to his stand-out summer capture of Jack Rodwell. Once the transfer frenzy subsides, though, the former Chelsea midfielder will relish an extended run with his squad on the training pitch. 'The timing of the goal didn't help,' said Poyet. 'I don't know if it was overconfidence after a decent start, but there's no place for that at all. 'We know the numbers we've got to work with, so we've just got to get on with it now.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . One World Trade Center may have nabbed the title of the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, but a new structure isn't far behind. The Nordstrom Tower, at 227 W. 57th Street, will be the tallest residential structure in the world when it is completed in 2018 - when it will measure just one foot shorter than One World Trade Center. New information leaked to YIMBY reveals its dizzying measurements, showing that the glass-fronted building will rise to an eye-watering 1,775 feet at its spire, while the One World Trade Center measures a symbolic 1,776 feet tall. In fact, the roof of the Nordstrom Tower will overtake One World Trade Center as plans show its facade will stretch until 1,479 feet above street level. High life: A look at how the . Nordstrom Tower (fifth from left), which is currently being constructed . in New York, measures up to the world's tallest buildings . One World Trade Center's roof stops at 1,368 feet - which is the same height as the north tower of the original World Trade Center. Nordstrom's staggering height means it will push past other record-setting structures, including the 1,450-foot World One Tower in Mumbai, which will also be a residential structure once it's complete. 'The new height details will result in . several superlatives,' YIMBY explained. 'Manhattan will finally retake the ""tallest roof"" in the United States from Chicago's Willis Tower, which stands 1,451', . and 225 West 57th Street will become the tallest residential building in . the entire world, surpassing both 432 Park Avenue and Mumbai’s World . One Tower.' Once it is completed, the building will have a giant seven-floor Nordstrom department store on the lower levels and residences above. Tall order: Pictured are renderings of what the building will look like when it is finished in 2018; it will be 300 ft higher than anything else in Midtown . Going up! Another rendering shows the top of the building - which will be higher than the Willis Tower's roof, which holds the current U.S. record . 360 degree views: This drawing of the Nordstrom Tower was leaked by a tipster and shows the latest plan. The first seven floors will be Nordstrom stores . When it's finished, the Nordstrom Tower will become the world's tallest residential building at 1,775 ft. How does this compare with other structures around the world? 1. Burj Khalifa, Dubai: 2,717 ft (828m) 2. Shanghai Tower, China: 2,073 ft (632m) 3. Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel, Mecca, Saudi Arabia: 1,971 ft (601m) 4. One World Trade Center, New York: 1,776 ft (541.3m) 5. Taipei 101, Taiwan: 1,670 ft (501m) The most recent permits, which were partially approved on July 1st, reveal that the building could reach more than 1.2 million square feet. It will stand more than 300 feet taller than any other man-made objects in Midtown and will likely cast a few shadows on Central Park, which is near its base. The . completion of 225 West 57th Street is slated for 2018, and is one of . seven super-slim luxury high-rises currently under construction in . Midtown. Another, the 1,350 foot 111 West 57th Street building. will be higher than the Empire State Building's observation deck once it is finished. Last year, a study conducted by the Municipal Art Society (MAS) sparked concern that the super tall buildings would leave park visitors in the shadows. The study found that on December 21, the winter solstice, the park will hit its darkest point, with shadows extending 20 blocks into the park - reaching the Lake and Ramble. In their report, the Municipal Art Society proposes a re-appraisal of zoning codes to ensure that there's more oversight and public involvement in making this new breed of skyscrapers. Advances . in skyscraper engineering mean these buildings can be constructed super . slim - about two townhouses wide in some cases - occupying plots of . land originally suited for 40-story buildings. It has been designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, which was behind Dubai's massive Burj Khalifa, which is the tallest . building in the world at 2,717 feet. Still a way to go: A Google view shows West 57th Street where the building will be constructed; critics complain it will cast too many shadows .","The Nordstrom Tower is under construction on West 57th Street in Manhattan and will be completed in 2018 .
It will measure 1,775 feet at its spire - which is 300 feet taller than anything else in Midtown but one foot shorter than One World Trade Center .
It means Manhattan will retake the 'tallest roof' title from Chicago's Willis Tower and take over a Mumbai building as the tallest residential building ."

"By . Amanda Williams . Culture secretary Maria Miller is rolling out a 'guide for girls' information pack for parents in order to help them bring up 'aspirational young women' The Government is set to produce a 'guide for girls' information pack for parents in order to help them bring up 'aspirational young women'. The packs will include information on education and career choices for young women to help them 'realise their potential'. The campaign is being rolled out by women's minister and culture secretary Maria Miller amid concerns that today's girls and young women are lacking in ambition. The packs are being produced in response to recommendations from the Women's Business Council (WBC), which was set up last year to advise government on what more can be . done to maximise women's contribution to economic growth. The number of women chief executives listed in the FTSE 100 has fallen in the past year. Just three women head large London-listed firms, the Observer reports. In a report set to be published on Tuesday the WBC is expected to say that a key task is to 'broaden girls' aspirations and job choices before the start of their working lives'. It also says increasing the number of women in the workforce could help stimulate economic growth by as much as 0.5 per cent a year. The report says that if women were setting up businesses at the same rate as men, there could be as many as 1 million more female entrepreneurs. Ms Miller told the Observer that ensuring women are successful at work and in business is essential for a strong economy. She added: 'Encouraging women to fulfil their potential doesn't begin when they are already working; it starts when they are young, still at school. The packs will include information on education and career choices for young women to help them 'realise their potential' A vital part of future career success is the aspirations that girls have early in their lives, and the choices they make about subjects and qualifications. 'Parents are vital in helping girls make these choices, and we know that many parents want help with that. ' The government wants there to be 25 per cent female representation in FTSE 100 boardrooms by 2015. However, progress has been slow - currently just 5.6 per cent of FTSE 100 directors are women. If the target is not reached, business secretary Vince Cable has threatened to impose quotas for women in the boardroom.","Packs will include information on education and career choices .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Struck off: Dr Mohammad Tariquezzaman, 51, watched the patient undress, pulled down her underwear and said she had a 'nice body' at University College Hospital in south London . A married doctor who told a university student she had a 'nice body' during a consultation before asking her out for a curry has been struck off today. Father-of-four Dr Mohammad Tariquezzaman - known as Dr Zaman - performed an 'unnecessary' internal examination when the 20-year-old woman arrived at University College Hospital, London, complaining of stomach pains. The 51-year-old 'smirked' as he watched her undress, pulled her knickers down to her thighs and commented on her appearance during the 20-minute appointment. When the woman, known only as Patient A, told him she felt uncomfortable, he laughed and said: ‘This isn’t the first time this has been done to you.’ Zaman, who has worked in Britain for 18 years, also took her phone number, asked whether she had a boyfriend and invited her out for an Indian meal. The patient's mother, a nurse, contacted police after her daughter told her about the examination at the hands of Zaman. The doctor, who also worked at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in Putney, south west London, was cleared of sexual assault by penetration after a trial at Blackfriars Crown Court in December 2011. But he was struck by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service panel after they found him guilty of sexual misconduct. The panel told Zaman that the examination was 'unnecessary' and his actions were sexually motivated. The devout Muslim had asked the MPTS panel to suspend him for a year. But  chairman Dr Vicki Harris told him: ‘The panel could not be confident that you had no attitudinal problems in light of your smirking, laughter and inappropriate comments to your patient during the internal vaginal examination. ‘Your actions were clearly deplorable and your breaches of Good Medical Practice [professional guidelines] were particularly serious. ‘They eroded the trust that patients are entitled to have in doctors. Notwithstanding the testimonials and the mitigation that you advanced, in particular that . relating to the financial and personal consequences of erasure, the panel has concluded that your misconduct is so serious that it is fundamentally incompatible with continued registration.’ She added: ‘The panel concluded that your extensive and material breaches of professional standards were so serious that it is necessary to erase your name from the medical register. ‘It considered this to be the only means by which it could meet its obligation to protect patients and satisfy the wider public interest.’ Zaman had denied the allegations, insisting he was not attracted to black girls, but the fitness the panel preferred the evidence of his victim. The accounting and finance student said she had gone to hospital suffering abdominal pain after falling ill during while working part-time in a clothes shop. She attended the accident and emergency department and was seen by Zaman, who was working as a locum senior house officer at the time. He also suggested she should go to his private practice in Putney for free, even though there was no clinical reason for her to do so, the tribunal found. Sexual misconduct: The victim, referred to as Patient A, arrived at University College Hospital in south London complaining of stomach pains and was subjected to an 'unnecessary' internal examination by Zaman . Zaman told her to get undressed, but failed to offer her a chaperone or provide her with any privacy, it was found. Giving evidence, Patient A said: ‘He examined around my navel, the left side and the other parts of my abdomen. That was what he examined before the internal examination.’ She continued: ‘When he was doing the internal exam my eyes were closed because I thought it was uncomfortable. ‘It was kind of embarrassing so my eyes were closed and I opened my eyes whilst it was going on and that’s when I saw he was looking at me.’ She told the panel that Zaman smirked and laughed when she told him she felt uncomfortable and, referring to her boyfriend, said: ‘This isn’t the first time this has been done to you.’ Patient A added: ‘I did tell him I felt uncomfortable at the time and I was in a lot of pain and up until he said a certain comment and I realised where the consultation was going I honestly did think he was examining me. Delporable: The father-of-four also invited the female patient for a free consultation at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in Putney, south west London . ‘From what he was saying and the way he was talking I realised that he was not examining me and by then it was too late for me to do anything. It’s not in my character to make a big scene or scream.’ When he had finished the procedure he joked: ‘Everything’s fine, you’re clean.’ She said: ‘He said he would contact me and he also mentioned something about an Indian restaurant and trying to find out if I was available the next day or the day afterwards.’ Zaman continues to deny the panel’s findings and says he is being ‘crucified for a sin I have not done at all’ He had been subject to a string of conditions since March 2010, one of which prevented him from conducting intimate examinations without a chaperone, except in life-threatening situations. Zaman now has 28 days to appeal the decision. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mohammad Tariquezzaman 'smirked' as he watched female patient undress .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Struggling to sell: Robbie Williams, 40, is struggling to sell Compton Bassett House, near Marlborough, which is on the market for £5.5m . He has already been struggling to find a buyer. Now, Robbie Williams’ attempts to sell his country mansion risk taking on a whiff of desperation ... due to stinking fumes from a nearby landfill site. Described as more potent that rotten eggs, the clouds of steam have been plaguing his Wiltshire village with dozens of complaints made to the parish council. And villagers, who fear the stench will affect house prices, say it is at its worst around the singer’s estate. The waste management firm that runs the landfill site has even set up a de-odourising system which works in the same way as a household air freshener, pumping out gas to disguise the pong. Williams, 40, bought Compton Bassett House, which is set in 71 acres of parkland and manicured lawns near Marlborough, for £8.1million in 2009. But he dropped the price to £5.5million earlier this year after failing to attract a buyer before placing a lavish advertisement in Country Life without a price tag. One resident, who has logged complaints with the waste contractors through the parish council, said that depending on the wind, the stink can also affect those living near BBC comic Michael McIntyre’s home in a neighbouring village. He said: ‘It causes people to close their windows. Residents have got fed up with complaining as they can’t see how it’s going to end. It’s depressing. 'The stench is more obnoxious than rotten eggs and will definitely affect house prices. There’s a few bed and breakfasts and it could affect their businesses as nobody wants to stay in a place with a pong. 'The smell is at its worst right by Robbie Williams’ house but if the wind changes direction the gas comes down to my house.’ It is believed heavy rainfall over the winter drenched rubbish that had not yet been covered with earth at the site, around half a mile from Williams’ home. Then, after the decomposing waste was buried, the water mixture combined with warm weather caused huge amounts of gas to be released. Scroll down for video . Williams, who has been living in Los . Angeles with his wife Ayda, is said to have been searching for a new . home for his family for more than a year. He spent £17.5million last . year on a 46-room West London mansion once owned by film director . Michael Winner. The singer is said to want his 11-month-old daughter Theodora Rose to have a British passport and education. McIntyre, 38, spent £2.5million last year on his six-bedroom Wiltshire home. 'The stench is more obnoxious than rotten eggs...The smell is at its worst right by Robbie Williams’ house' Nearby resident . He left London to live in the stone farmhouse with his wife Kitty and sons Lucas, nine, and six-year-old Oscar. Pete Szczesiak, chairman of Compton Bassett Parish Council, confirmed it had received complaints about the smell. He added: ‘There’s a really unpleasant odour and it’s especially strong with all the recent hot weather. We are currently investigating it with the waste contractors.’ Hills Waste Management, which runs the landfill site, said in an email to residents that it was working to stop the smell. It is not known what gas is being used to cover the fumes as part of its de-odourising system.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A developer and city officials say some changes have been negotiated in a controversial plan for a so-called 'poor door' that was to be used by less-affluent residents of a new Manhattan skyscraper. People who live in the pricey condos of the 42-story Upper West Side building will still enter through the luxurious front lobby. But residents of the 'affordable' portion of the complex - who will pay steeply reduced rent under a government-funded program - will have a separate entrance and exit. Now, under new plan ammendments, developer Larry Silverstein says those people will have access to a courtyard and a roof deck facing the Hudson River. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Workers prepare the main entrance of a new residential building on Manhattan's West Side. Residents of the less-luxurious condos in the complex will use a separate so-called 'poor door' 'Poor door': The separate doors are the result of a change to the zoning rules in 2009 that allowed developers to build multiples building segments on the same site, where each is required to have its own entrance. However many argue it is separatist and unfair . Developing: Known as 10 Freedom Place, the market-rate apartments are perched atop affordable-housing units (picture) in a glass tower . Glassy: The entrance for owners of the market-rate apartments will feature a door man . Making changes: Larry Silverstein, chairman of Silverstein Properties, made changes to the building plans so that affordable-housing residents have access to some of the amenities in the adjacent building, such as the rooftop garden . The 'poor door' will also open up to a planned public park. It also will feature custom wood and a lobby with a glass facade. The changes follow outrage over the announcement that 'less valuable residents were being pushed out the back door'. City officials call the project a model for integrating affordable and market-rate apartments. But they're also hoping for changes in the law to forbid separate entrances. In order to get tax breaks or permission to construct major buildings in New York, developers agree to build a certain amount of subsidized housing units in the same area. State assembly woman Linda B Rozenthaal is working to take away those tax breaks from developers who plan to have separate entrances. Controvery: A project a few blocks away from the Silverstein venture, by Extell Development Co. at 40 Riverside Blvd. (puctred), has sparked similar outrage in recent weeks for also including a 'poor door' 'The zoning resolution can be changed so that this kind of set up cannot be legal,' she said. Until the laws are changed are made, officials will use the recent changes to Silverstein's plans as a precedent. 'I do think we've made a blueprint,' Vicki Been, commissioner of the Housing Preservation and Development Department, told The Wall Street Journal. 'The blueprint is that you've got to have a building that signals, ''You are welcome here. You are just as valuable as every person in this neighborhood''.'

"By . MailOnline Reporter . ESPN has apologized for a SportsCenter report centering on the showering habits of Michael Sam, the first openly gay player in the National Football League. The controversial report was aired on Tuesday, when instead of focusing on the St. Louis Rams' first round of cuts, reporter Josina Anderson chose to feature Sam's shower etiquette. 'Another . Rams defensive player told me that “Sam is respecting our space” and . that, from his perspective, he seems to think that Michael Sam is kind . of waiting to take a shower, as not to make his teammates feel . uncomfortable,' Anderson said. The reporter says she also asked other players about Sam's showering schedule. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Reporter Josina Anderson delivered the report that forced ESPN to apologize for focusing on the showering habits of Michael Sam, the NFL's first openly gay athlete . Prediction: When he became the NFL's first open gay football player in May, Michael Sam said, 'Hey, are there going to be idiots out there and say some stupid stuff? Yeah. I'm not worried about that.' ESPN spokesman Josh Krulewitz wrote in a statement that the network 'regrets the manner in which we presented our report.' 'Clearly, yesterday we collectively failed to meet . the standards we have set in reporting on LGBT-related topics in sports,' he added. Sam and the St. Louis Rams made history in May when the team made him the first openly-gay player ever drafted by an NFL team. The highly decorated defensive end was drafted in the seventh round, 249th overall, and famously kissed boyfriend Vito Cammisano after smashing cake in his face on national television. Sam was named as both an All-American and the SEC Defensive player of the year after a stellar senior campaign last season for the University of Missouri. He saw his draft stock plummet after a poor showing at the scouting combine earlier this year. Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano cried tears of joy as they heard the football star had just made professional sports history . Celebration: Sam and his boyfriend kissed in front of the ESPN cameras in May, which were broadcasting the historical moment nationally . Sam was shown on television crying as he received the phone call notifying him he would indeed be an NFL player, he then kissed Cammisano before they hugged and cried tears of joy. Rams coach Jeff Fisher acknowledged there would be added media attention surrounding Sam's arrival at training camp but said 'we’re not going to let any kind of distraction affect this football team.' Perhaps predicting Tuesday's turn of events, Sam told reporters: 'Hey, are there going to be idiots out there and say some stupid stuff? Yeah. I'm not worried about that.' Many current Rams tweeted congratulatory messages to their new teammate and said they looked forward to getting him on the field.

"By . Joel Christie . Michael Egan III, the child model who accused several Hollywood figures of sexually abusing him, accepted a $100,000 settlement from X-Men director Bryan Singer only to back out at the 11th hour, it has emerged. The strange manoeuvre is said to have cost Egan his lawyer. Egan recently dropped three lawsuits against other men he claimed abused him during a trip to Hawaii in 1999 when he was 17, leaving only Singer. TMZ reports that Egan's lawyer, Jeff Herman, approached Singer's lawyer, Marty Singer, offering to drop the case for $100,000. It also notes that a $100K settlement payment would be far less than Singer would spend in legal fees defending against the claims and would be viewed as a nuisance payment. Scroll down for video . Dismissed: Michael Egan III, who filed four lawsuits against four Hollywood figures but dropped three of them, dismissed a $100,000 settlement offer from the remaining accused, Bryan Singer . Accused: TMZ reports that Hollywood director Brian Singer offered $100,000 to close the sexual abuse lawsuit, but the deal fell through at the last-minute . Cases closed: The lawsuits against TV executive David Neuman (left) and theater producer Gary Goddard (right) were both withdrawn last month . However, after the settlement was signed, Egan changed his mind and reneged, according to the tabloid site. 'This exact kind of take-it-and-shut-up deal is why I decided to stand up in the first place,' he said. Herman, apparently wanting the lawsuit to be done with, has now backed out completely, according to TMZ. Last month, Egan dismissed a lawsuit against theater producer Gary Wayne Goddard. Egan's lawyers did not explain why . they dropped the lawsuit in their two-page filing, saying only that the . matter was dismissed without prejudice, meaning Egan can refile the . lawsuit if he chooses. He . filed suit under an unusual state law that created a window for civil . lawsuits in sex abuse cases where the statute of limitations has passed. The men have denied . the allegations, and Singer has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit . against him. A hearing is set in the Singer case for August 4. Also last month, Egan dropped a lawsuit against Garth Ancier. Suing: Garth Ancier says Mike Egan and his attorneys knew a lawsuit accusing him of sexual molestation when Egan was a teenager was false . The . former network TV executive filed a malicious-prosecution lawsuit . against Egan saying the accusations had damaged his reputation. Mr . Ancier, 56, who was a high-ranking executive at the NBC, Fox and WB . networks, filed his lawsuit in a federal court in Honolulu two days . after Michael Egan III, 31, voluntarily dismissed his case. Ancier . lawsuit states his reputation was damaged by Egan's claims that he was . sexually molested by the executive and other entertainment industry . figures, including . Ancier said he never visited the estate in Hawaii where Egan claims he was abused. Ancier is seeking punitive damages. He claimed he has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars defending himself. Ancier and X-Men director Bryan Singer have denied being in Hawaii at the time Egan says he was abused. Ancier's suit claims that Egan and his attorney sought to 'smear, harass and severely injure Mr Ancier as part of an avowed and . very public campaign by Mr Egan’s counsel to troll for new clients who . would enable them to shake down other entertainment industry executives . with threats of sexual assault charges.' Legal wrangle: Mike Egan (center) with his attorney Jeff Herman (right) and his mother Bonnie Mound during a media conference in April . Egan's . attorneys did not respond to requests by Ancier's attorneys to produce . evidence that supported the sex abuse lawsuit, the new case states. Ancier was in Los Angeles and New York developing lineups of shows for . NBC at the time Egan claims he was abused. 'This fabrication of facts in Hawaii . that never took place, to create jurisdiction in a forum where there was . none and to drum up more business for Mr Egan's counsel, requires that . defendants be held to account for malicious prosecution and abuse of . process,' the lawsuit states. 'Mike . Egan maintains that he was sexually abused by Garth Ancier in both . Hawaii and California. Prior to filing the case in Hawaii, Mike was . examined by a psychologist who made findings that supports Mike's . claims,' Herman wrote in an email.

"By . John Greechan . and Stephen Mcgowan For The Daily Mail . Virgil van Dijk has told Celtic he wants to quit Parkhead before the transfer window closes on Monday night. The £9million-rated Dutch defender has been the subject of interest from clubs including Sunderland, Newcastle, Sevilla and Southampton. And, despite serving just 12 months of a four-year deal, the 23-year-old wants to leave following Tuesday night’s Champions League exit at the hands of Maribor. Gutted: Virgil van Dijk has his head in hands after Celtic crashed out of the Champions League - and he could be heading for the exit door . Down and out: van Dijk wants to leave Celtic after just a year at Parkhead . The impact of that defeat was clearly illustrated yesterday when Celtic were drawn against Dinamo Zagreb, Salzburg and Romanian minnows Astra in an uninspiring Europa League group. Celtic have told van Dijk they have no wish to sell but, as they prepare to ship Amido Balde out on loan in the final weekend of the transfer window, the champions are fighting an uphill battle to prevent the Dutchman departing. ‘We need the players we have, so we hope to keep the team as it is now,’ manager Ronny Deila said. The Norwegian admitted some players could head out, with Balde wanted by former club Vitoria Guimaraes on a 12-month loan. Return: Amido Balde could be heading back to former club Vitoria Guimaraes on loan . Targetman: Stefan Scepovic has been brought to bolster Celtic's attack . And he added: ‘I want to get people out so they can play, not just overflow in the squad but also young players who need to go out and get experience. ‘That’s two different groups. There are a lot of things going on with loans and the squad, getting the squad balanced.’ New striker Stefan Scepovic underwent a medical and chief executive Peter Lawwell also plans to head off new interest from Crystal Palace in Kris Commons by holding contract talks with his agent on Tuesday. ‘Stefan is more of a target player,’ said Deila. ‘He scores and is a box player. He’s very good with both legs and scores in the air, as well, so he can make something from crosses and add power. ‘He is different to what we’ve had before, something we’ve been looking for, so I’m pleased to get the deal done.’ Disgruntled: Boss Ronny Deila has moved to assure Kris Commons of his role at the club . Dejected: It's been a difficult week for Deila as Celtic crashed out of the Champions League . Commons could sign a new deal after receiving assurances he is still part of Deila’s plans. As Sportsmail reported on Thursday, the 31-year-old was unhappy with starting both Maribor games on the bench, but Deila stressed: ‘Kris knows that he has a future here, he knows he’s an important player for the team. He has played nearly every game. ‘Of course I understand he’s disappointed that he didn’t play these games. But that was a tactical decision, not because of a bad performance by Kris. He will have a big influence on the team in the future. ‘I’ve talked to Kris about this. Of course I understand he’s disappointed that he didn’t play. But we’re a team. There are a lot of good players in there. ‘He played against Legia, he played against Reykjavik. He played all the games. We had a plan to do things differently against Maribor and I think we improved. ‘I think the decision was right. I think he was good when he came on the pitch. Unfortunately, we didn’t make it. ‘The team is more important than one player. Everybody knows that. We are a very big club with a lot of good players, a big squad, and we have to use that strength and take it into every match. ‘It’s not about Kris Commons, it’s about the total team. We were thinking we needed more legs in midfield against Maribor, that’s why we did it.’ Asked if he was happy with the fitness of Commons, Deila said: ‘He is a professional, so he works hard. He wants to do it in the proper way – and this is an example for the others.’ Callum McGregor, meantime, has been rewarded for his sterling progress in the first-team with a new five-year deal.

"By . Simon Peach . Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino is well aware of the threat posed by Liverpool, but does not want his players to approach Sunday's encounter differently to any of their other matches this season. Spurs start the weekend top of the Barclays Premier League, having followed up a 1-0 win at West Ham with an impressive 4-0 thrashing of Harry Redknapp's QPR. That 100 per cent start to life under the former Southampton boss has extended to the Europa League, where a 2-1 win at AEL Limassol was followed up on Thursday by a 3-0 triumph in the second leg of their play-off tie. Scroll down for video... Same, same: Mauricio Pochettino doesn't want his players to treat the Liverpool game any differently . Tottenham go looking for a fifth successive win when Liverpool arrive in north London on Sunday - a match Pochettino wants his players to approach in the same manner as recent games. 'We are looking forward to Sunday,' he said. 'I think it is a great game, a tough game. We are looking forward to it. We will try to win the three points. 'For me, all games are a big a test. It is true that Liverpool were second last season and they have invested a lot of money on buying different players. 'Yes, it is a big test but we need to put in place a mentality to get three points. We need this mentality for Sunday like we had in the last games.' Hot Spurs: Harry Kane celebrates scoring against Limassol to extend Tottenham's unbeaten run to four game . Sunday's match offers Spurs a chance to gain revenge after the Reds, who secured one of the results of last season by winning 5-0 on their last visit to White Hart Lane. That match resulted in Andre Villas-Boas' sacking, although successor Tim Sherwood did not fare much better as his side went down 4-0 at Anfield. A similar humbling would seriously derail Pochettino's positive start, and is not a prospect he is even contemplating. 'We are in the beginning of this project,' he told Spurs TV. 'Only two months I have been at Tottenham. Red alert: Philippe Coutinho scores one of nine goals Liverpool hit past Tottenham last season . 'Liverpool have played the last two seasons in the same way, but without any doubt we try to put our philosophy to try and win the three points. That for us is important.

Chelsea will step up their pursuit of Mattia Destro from Roma if Fernando Torres can agree personal terms on a move to AC Milan. Jose Mourinho has identified Destro as a young player who can add variety to his squad, even though Roma have cooled on the idea of selling the striker. The Italian club claim he is ‘100 per cent not for sale’ and no longer have a great urgency to raise funds after banking £35million by selling defender Medhi Benatia to Bayern Munich. Scroll down for videos... Late deal? Chelsea are interested in bringing Roma striker Mattia Destro to Stamford Bridge . Italian job? Mattia Destro could replace Fernando Torres if Spaniard completes a move to AC Milan . Chelsea, however, remain keen. Destro fits their age profile, can operate across the front line and earns a fraction of the £175,000 a week they pay Torres. If Milan agree to cover the final two years of Torres’ contract, Chelsea will have cash available to bid for a player valued at £20million. If they prefer to sign him on a one-year loan, Chelsea will have to be more creative. Agents of Torres were in Italy for talks with Milan and one of them, Antonio Sanz, is reported to have said: ‘The meeting went well. Torres to AC Milan is a real possibility. We take some time to reflect before giving a decision. Milan are a great club.’ The issue is pressing for Chelsea at a time when they have concerns about the fitness of Diego Costa. Scare: There are doubts over Diego Costa's fitness after £32m striker suffered muscle strain in training . Costa missed training on Thursday as a precaution after suffering from a tight hamstring against Leicester on Saturday and again in training on Wednesday. A scan showed no serious damage but the Brazil-born Spain international has a recent history of hamstring trouble. He has not been ruled out of Saturday's game at Everton but Mourinho will take no risks because Costa can take a two-week rest through the international break if he does not play at Goodison. The scare crystallises a major problem for Chelsea, however, with Didier Drogba 36 and Torres out of favour. Blues bother! Jose Mourinho is concerned about Chelsea's attacking options this season . Demba Ba, Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto’o have all left this summer and although they spent £32m on his first-choice Costa, Mourinho will look to the board to back him again over Destro. Ba, meanwhile, admits he longed to play for Arsenal. Now with Besiktas, the striker came close to ruining Arsenal’s Champions League hopes during Wednesday’s 1-0 defeat at the Emirates. Afterwards, Ba said he wished he could have been the man riding to Arsene Wenger’s rescue after Olivier Giroud’s broken ankle, but had to seize the chance to leave Chelsea for Besiktas when it came. Top Guns: Demba Ba (R) has revealed that he longed to join London rivals Arsenal after leaving Chelsea . Wenger almost signed Ba on loan from Chelsea last year and, when asked how close he came to becoming an Arsenal player, the forward said: ‘As close as you and me, here. Even when I was in Chelsea, everybody knew that I wanted to go to Arsenal. ‘It’s not a secret to anyone. I wanted to join Arsenal because it was the club back in the day.

The suspicious speedboat had been spotted by a US Maritime Patrol Aircraft and Plymouth-based boat HMS Argyll was deployed. It took the Type 23 ‘Duke’ frigate half a day to catch up with the small vessel after it launched a Lynx helicopter to confirm the crew were suspected drug smugglers. Sailors from HMS Argyll seized 18 bags of cocaine with a street value of £21million after chasing a speedboat in the Caribbean for 12 hours and detaining the five suspects on board, who were handed over to US authorities . Five suspects were detained on HMS Argyll (pictured) before they were  handed over to the US authorities . Navy sailors dispatched high-speed sea boats to intercept the ship and seize their haul. On board they found 600 kilos of cocaine, which had been packed into bales and wrapped in bin bags, and with an estimated UK street value of £21million. Five suspects were detained in HMS Argyll and handed over to US authorities. The seizure was part of a joint counter-narcotics operation with the US to target South American drug networks. The ship launched a Lynx helicopter to confirm the boat was acting in a way typical of drug smugglers before it sent boats to capture the crew. They found 600 kilos of cocaine on board (pictured) and wrapped in bin bags . Armed Forces Minister Mark Francois said: ‘The Royal Navy has a hard-earned record of tackling illegal drugs smuggling and we should be extremely proud that HMS Argyll has been involved in a dramatic and very successful operation to disrupt the supply. ‘The operations showed tenacity and professionalism.’ HMS Argyll's Commanding Officer, Commander Paul Hammond, said: 'My team and I knew that a swift and correct interception was required in this case.

Unveiled here in an exclusive set of photos, the classic coats and wearable dresses are the latest to emerge from the fashionable brain of style director, Belinda Earl, and reveal a new focus on traditional materials after years of polycotton and pleather. Drawing on heritage pieces from the M&S archive, highlights include a flattering cotton blouse in a chic red and white print, and a pure wool pale grey duffle coat. Scroll down or video . Stylish: The new Best of British collection includes coats made in Manchester and plenty of Scottish wool . Highlights: Top pieces include this £59 crimson dress (left) and the traditional herringbone tweed coat, £299 . Others likely to prove popular include a simple navy wool jumper and an on-trend 60s shift dress crafted from scarlet wool. The collection, which launches on the 28th August, is the latest weapon unleashed by the high street brand in a bid to boost flagging sales figures. Despite the success of last autumn's pink duster coat, which will be reissued this year in a rainbow of hues, M&S has struggled to compete with cheap and cheerful brands such as Primark and New Look. Damp squib collections for Per Una haven't helped and have allowed Next, which specialises in stylish, middle-of-the-road pieces, to pull ahead.

Cosy: A royal blue wool coat made in Manchester costs £299 while the cotton shirt beneath comes in at £89 .

Along with Scottish wool and Mancunian coats, the 54-piece range, which starts at £59, also includes chic pale leather brogues made by a family-run firm in Northampton. Traditional fabrics such as herringbone and jacquard dominate, with the latter turned into wearable cocktail dresses that would do sterling service on chilly autumn nights.

A few hours earlier, around 10 a.m., witnesses had seen Krueger and Warner leaving the apartment with luggage, police said. Neither suspect owns a car and they were not answering their cell phones. Someone who spotted the couple at a restaurant near a Bay Area Rapid Transit station on Sunday in the city of El Cerrito alerted police, and BART officers detained them, Peecook said. BART police Lt. Gil Lopez said they were detained without incident at the station in El Cerrito, about 30 miles south of Napa. They were questioned and booked on suspicion of murder with special circumstances and assault on a child resulting in death. Peecook said she didn't know whether they have retained an attorney. Neighbors said that the home had been the scene of multiple disturbances since Kreuger's boyfriend 26-year-old Scott Warner moved in . Scene: Napa police received an anonymous phone call around 1 p.m. Saturday requesting a welfare check on a three-year-old at an apartment in the Wilkins Avenue block, pictured, in Napa . The property manager at Krueger's apartment building told the Napa Valley Register . that in recent months, police visited the mother's residence for . several disturbances, including late-night noise, slamming doors and . neighbors reporting possible physical abuse of the child. Warner 'moved in about 10 months ago, and it all went downhill from there,' Elizabeth Chechourka said. 'Management . sent a letter to them about two and half weeks ago saying, ''The . authorities know about you, and you need to shape up or you're gonna . lose your housing,''' she added. Peecook said Napa officers had made . several welfare checks at Krueger's home, most recently last week but . none of the visits resulted in an arrest. Dead for days: The suspects told police they discovered Kayleigh dead late last week and had no idea how she died, the Napa Valley Register reported . Father: The child's father, Jason Slusher, is incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison. He has been informed of his daughter's death . She . said she didn't know whether Napa County Child Protective Services had . visited the apartment in response to any neighbors' complaints. A family friend who often baby-sat the girl was baffled by news of the girl's death and her mother's arrest. 'Never . saw her raise a hand to the girl. It was like pulling teeth getting her . to somewhat discipline her,' Kindra Kunkel told reporters. 'This is not Sara; this is not the Sara I know,' said Kunkel. 'She fought so hard for her little girl.'","Kayleigh Slusher's body was found in a bed in her mom's Napa home Saturday with blunt force trauma injuries and evidence of sexual assault, police said .

"By . Michael Gadd for MailOnline . Adam Lallana is set to make his Liverpool debut at Tottenham on Sunday, Reds boss Brendan Rodgers confirmed after the £25 million summer signing from Southampton impressed at training during the week. Lallana has recovered from a knee ligament injury picked up during training in Boston on Liverpool's pre-season tour of the US and joins striker Mario Balotteli among new faces available to Rodgers at White Hart Lane. 'Adam Lallana will definitely be in the squad,' Rodgers confirmed on Friday. 'He has looked fantastic in training.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers declare this isn't the Mario Balotelli show . 'Fantastic': Brendan Rodgers confirmed Adam Lallana will be in the Liverpool squad Sunday at Tottenham . On target: Lallana shows some poise in front of goal during preparations for the Spurs visit . With Monday's 11pm transfer deadline looming Rodgers has said there'll more likely be a clear out of sorts than any further big name arrivals at Merseyside. 'There aren't many more to come in, if any at all. We will have more going out than coming in,' Rodgers said. 'We have brought players in who can affect the team. That is the beauty of it. We are not relying on them all to make a difference.' Jordon Ibe's loan departure to Derby County was confirmed earlier on Friday. Jose Enrique will be  available to Rodgers on Sunday although Glen Johnson will likely miss out due to thigh complaint.

The £16 million arrival from AC Milan gives Rodgers a good dilemma as to whether or not he hands the controversial but talented forward an instant debut. Fans have also responded positively to Balotelli's arrival, congregating at Melwood to get a glimpse of the former City marksman. But when asked at his pre-match press conference about the Italy striker, Rodgers issued a reminder that there is more than one man in his squad. 'Mario is fine and has settled in very well, but the focus is on his football,' Rodgers said. High hopes: The £16 million signing from AC Milan rises high ahead of his possible debut for Liverpool . Spike: Balotelli has spring in his step as Liverpool gets ready for Sunday's clash . 'Balotelli is a class act. He is moving to Merseyside. But it's not the Balotelli show. The star of this team will always be the team.' Liverpool face Spurs on the back of a convincing loss to defending champions Manchester City but Rodgers is certain his side can pick themselves up quickly. He said: 'We have been good at bouncing back. It's a strange feeling but we are not used to losing. That's not sounding arrogant.

"By . Press Association Reporter . On-loan Hull players Joe Arundel and Jay Pitts scored against their parent club as already doomed Bradford Bulls made it three wins out of three for the first time this season with a 34-28 victory over the Black and Whites at the Provident Stadium, Odsal. The Championship-bound Bulls had surprisingly beaten champions Wigan and Challenge Cup finalists Leeds in their previous two games and gained a third successive success by coming from 12 points down to outscore their East Yorkshire opponents six tries to four with Jamie Foster, who also had a spell on loan at Hull, adding five goals for the hosts. Hull have now won just one of their last eight games, ironically against Super League leaders St Helens, and this latest defeat virtually ends any realistic hopes of extending their season into the play-offs. Hull remain five points behind Widnes, who hold the eighth and final play-off place, with only three games remaining. Close win: Bradford Bulls' Luke Gale is tackled by Hull FC's Gareth Ellis during his side's Super League victory . The visitors took advantage of strong and blustery wind to get the better of a first half played in occasionally squally showers but, once the sides had swapped ends, the Bulls always held the upper hand. Helped forward by a penalty for interference, some slick handling and a neat inside pass from Dean Hadley put Jamie Shaul in beside the posts for his 15th try of the season with Joe Westerman converting to give the Black and Whites the best possible start. Luke Gale almost grabbed a try back but was forced into touch near the corner flag by Shaul. Westerman almost put Richard Horne clear but Brett Kearney thwarted the attack before Gareth Ellis helped double the visitors lead form close range after the Bulls had again been penalised, this time for reefing, near their own line. Poor ball control did not help the hosts' cause and they were forced to soak up more pressure before, on a rare venture forward, a Luke Gale kick was allowed to bounce fortuitously for the Bulls and Arundel, on a season-long loan from the KC Stadium, sent Jamie Foster racing over on the left to score, then convert his own try, topping the 1000 career points mark in the process. Hull had chances to restore their advantage as Westerman was denied a try by a forward pass, then Richard Horne intercepted a loose pass from Gale but Danny Addy executed a fine stop. But a minute later a Lee Gaskell break sent Arundel racing 30 metres into the corner to touchdown, although Foster was unlucky to see his conversion swept onto the near upright by the wind and bounce out again. Barely three minutes into the second half, good work from Gaskell created a chance for Adam Sidlow to power over and give the Bulls the lead for the first time. Five minutes later Arundel dummied his way over for a second try against his parent club, then Gaskell split the defence gifting Pitts with a try and, with Foster adding all three conversions, the momentum swing was complete at 28-12. Ellis grabbed a quick-fire try back for Hull and Danny Houghton was adjudged to be held up just before the hour mark as Hull tried to get back in the game. But an Addy try with ten minutes to go made the points safe for the Bulls, although Setaimata Sa claimed a late try and Tom Lineham added a further consolation for the Airlie Birds with Westerman finishing with four goals.","Bulls won their third consecutive match for the first time this season .

"By . Ian Laybourn, Press Association . Hull KR have completed the re-construction of their new threequarter line with the signing of England Knights winger Kieran Dixon on a three-year contract from London Broncos. Dixon has been recognised as one of the most promising talents in Super League since bursting onto the scene two years ago but a move to big-spending Salford fell through at the end of last season when he sustained a major knee injury playing for the Knights against Samoa. Dixon, who made his Super League comeback in the Broncos' shock 40-36 win over Leeds on Sunday, when he took his try tally to 38 in 52 appearances, is the Robins' fifth new recruit for 2015 and will join Ken Sio, Josh Mantellato and Darrell Goulding in a new-look back line. Moving on: Kieran Dixon (right) has left the London Broncos to join Hull KR on a three-year contract . 'I wanted a new challenge and when I had the opportunity to come here I was very honoured,' said Dixon, who turns 22 on Friday. 'I'll be moving my family from one side of the country to the other so it is going to be a big change for us but one we are excited about. 'There's a big history at the club and the derby was something that appealed to me too. I've been in London my whole life and there isn't anything like the rivalry in Hull down there. 'I spoke to some boys that have played here and they say the city splits in two on derby day. I can't wait to be a part of it and show everyone what I can do for the red and white half of the city. 'I made the England Knights squad at the end of last year but my injury halted my progress a little bit. 'It's been frustrating but after two good years I'm hoping I can get back to my best form and challenge for an England spot in the not too distant future.' Hull KR coach Chris Chester said: 'We're delighted that Kieran has chosen to come to Hull KR from next season. 'He was on the verge of a full England call-up 12 months ago and he's had plenty of interest from other clubs so it's great that we've been able to sign a player of his calibre. 'We've identified a lack of speed in the outside backs and Kieran certainly brings pace in abundance. He's a great finisher and he scored another good try at the weekend so we're looking forward to what he can bring to the side.' Honoured: Dixon admits he was looking for a new challenge after two years playing for London Broncos . Dixon is the fourth confirmed London player to retain his Super League status following the Broncos' relegation to the Championship. Atelea Vea is joining St Helens and Denny Solomona and Matt Cook have secured moves to Castleford. Broncos coach Joey Grima said: 'I want to make it quite clear to all our supporters that we did make a substantial offer to him over a seven to eight-week period of negotiations but in Kieran's mind he always wanted to play Super League. 'Both myself and the club wish Kieran all the very best.

"By . Marcus Townend, Racing Correspondent . Andrea Atzeni will be the new first jockey to Qatar Racing next year after replacing Jamie Spencer, who retires at the end of the season. He will be joined at the racing organisation of Sheikh Fahad Al Thani and his brothers by teenage sensation and runaway apprentice title leader Oisin Murphy, who has also been contracted to ride for the operation. The appointment of the pair was predicted by Racemail. New man: Andrea Atzeni will become the new first jockey at Qatar Racing from next season . Time to go: Jamie Spencer is retiring from as first jockey at Qatar Racing, allowing Atzeni to come in . Also being shown the exit door at Qatar Racing is their second jockey Harry Bentley. While the changes are being dressed up as a change of structure within Qatar Racing, with 34-year-old Spencer taking up a management role, it seems clear that the current team of jockeys are paying the price for a moderate season for Sheik Fahad with his expensively assembled team. Bentley admitted as much when saying in his Racing UK column: 'I had been retained by Qatar Racing for two years so to part company after that period is naturally going to take a little time to sink in. 'There has been a reshuffle, with Jamie Spencer retiring, and questions have no doubt been asked after what has been a quiet season for Qatar Racing. ' The appointments of Atzeni, 23, and Murphy, 18, will mean a completely fresh riding roster for Qatar Racing in 2015 and Sheik Fahad has certainly invested in two of the Weighing Room's brightest young takents. Protege: Young rising star Oisin Murphy will take up the role as second jockey at Qatar Racing next season . David Redvers, Racing and Bloodstock Manager to Qatar Racing, said: 'With Jamie retiring and Harry concluding his two-year contract, Sheik Fahad is delighted to have secured the services of Andrea and Oisin for Qatar Racing. 'He has also asked me to reiterate his gratitude to both Jamie and Harry for all of their hard work, skill and professionalism.' During his two-year contract, Bentley rode stakes winners for Qatar Racing, most recently a Listed win on Valonia last weekend, and was runner-up in both the British and Irish 1,000 Guineas on Lightning Thunder, as well as being crowned champion jockey in Qatar. Redvers added: 'Andrea and Oisin have impressed us greatly this season and we are delighted to agree terms with them to take effect from the start of 2015.' Atzeni said: 'I feel very privileged to have been asked to ride as first jockey for Qatar Racing. I am excited at the prospect and look forward to repaying the faith Sheikh Fahad and his brothers have shown in appointing me.' Qatar Racing currently has around 250 horses in training worldwide, the majority of which are based in Britain, Ireland and France, as well as horses in Germany, Australia and USA.

"By . Press Association Reporter . Joe Keyes ran in a hat-trick as the London Broncos earned a first win of the Super League campaign at the 24th time of asking with a stunning 40-36 victory over the Leeds Rhinos. Keyes struck twice in the last 10 minutes as the Londoners staged a stirring comeback to erase a 30-8 deficit. For an under-strength Rhinos it was a setback ahead of their Tetley's Challenge Cup final date next weekend, missing the chance to claim second spot in the process. For the Broncos, there was a first start of the campaign for winger Kieran Dixon, 10 months on from knee surgery, with Thomas Minns stepping aside. Hat-trick hero: Joe Keyes, right, is congratulated by Broncos team-mate Atelea Vea after leading side to win . The visitors, with one eye on next weekend's Wembley showpiece, made nine changes from their semi-final defeat of Warrington, including giving Super League debuts to Ben White, Ashley Handley and Ashton Golding. But the under-strength Rhinos were still fastest out of the blocks, Zak Hardaker's long pass cutting out the London defence and allowing Kallum Watkins to romp home inside two minutes. Just four minutes later they had a second score, Hardaker again the provider, keeping the ball alive for Josh Walters to crash over. The Broncos were offering precious little in attack, but Leeds had no such worries, Liam Sutcliffe running in a third try on 12 minutes after strong work from Watkins. The Londoners finally got themselves on the board midway through the half, neat handling from Keyes and Nesi Mataitonga putting Jordan Atkins in at the corner. And the Broncos then moved within a score two minutes later, a superb offload from Atkins allowing Keyes to creep in at the corner. Suddenly the game was a real contest, Dixon close to levelling matters moments later when he attempted to wriggle over. But Leeds steadied the ship and regained control on the half-hour mark, Mitch Achurch charging over after a flowing move. There was still time for the porous London defence to concede a further try before the interval, Hardaker racing over after bouncing off a series of tackles. It was more of the same after the break, Paul Aiton's break giving Sutcliffe a clear run to the line to open up a 30-8 Rhinos lead on 44 minutes.

The Frenchman was a comfortable winner ahead of Giant-Shimano's John Degenkolb after an excellent lead-out from his FDJ team, while several riders lost position in the tight corners leading to the finish line.

They all stayed together, catching the break with a little under 17km to go and the battle began among the sprint teams to get to the front. It was FDJ who were on the nose heading into the final two turns, and that was all the advantage Bouhanni needed.

"By . Pa Reporter . Brazilian defender Douglas has described his arrival at Barcelona as the pinnacle of his career. Barca have made the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing and he was at the Nou Camp on Friday finalising his medical and preparing for his official unveiling. The full-back, who will cost up to 5.5million euros depending on appearances, was a surprise target for the Catalan club and is unlikely to feature in Sunday's Primera Division trip to Villarreal. Dream come true: Douglas says joining Barcelona represents a high point in his career . But simply being aboard represents a lifetime's ambition for player. 'This is the pinnacle for me - this is everything I could wish for,' he told Barca TV upon his arrival in the city. 'I am so happy to be able to represent this club. I want to thank everyone involved in me coming here and I just hope I can return their confidence in me on the pitch. 'I want to learn because the game here is different to how we play in Brazil.' Looking forward: The right-back has not won a cap for his Brazil yet, but hopes to join the likes of Neymar . Although Douglas admits he is ready to experience plenty of differences at Barcelona, at least one of his new team-mates is a familiar face. He added: 'They are all big stars here, I've seen them play of course and I've played against Neymar in Brazil - he is a sensational player and a great representative for the Brazil team.' Barca were unsurprising 3-0 winners over Elche in their season opener last week, with Villarreal also claiming three points with a 2-0 success at Levante. The Yellow Submarine followed that up with a 4-0 win over Astana at El Madrigal in the second leg of their Europa League play-off. Learning curve: Douglas acknowledges that life in Spain will be very different to the Brazilian league . Having also won 3-0 away from home, they now boast a record of nine goals scored and none conceded this season. Reflecting on the psychological boost afforded by the European triumph, manager Marcelino Garcia Toral said: 'It is very important for the entire group to be back into Europa League and it is a nice challenge for everyone. 'We are very happy to be in the group stage and playing as well as the team have done so far. 'All the players have been at a high level and therefore have achieved great results and you can not ask for more.'","Defender joins Barcelona from Sao Paulo for £4.4million .

"By . Craig Hope for the Daily Mail . Michael Dawson watched his older brother Andy become a Hull City legend as he helped them from the bottom division to the Premier League.

Earning his Spurs: Dawson has moved north in search of regular first-team football . ‘That was all light-hearted,’ said the 30-year-old. ‘Had Spurs not been 1-0 down at the time I might have given them a wave, but it was all good fun. ‘The reception I got on Thursday night was massive, it was a massive welcome and I am looking forward to repaying them for signing me and I’m sure the fans will be right behind me.’","Dawson moved to Hull in a £3.5million deal from Spurs earlier this week .

"By . John Greechan . It was harder work than many expected. And, for a spell, it looked as if a man whose day job involves sticking his hand down cludgies was going to be responsible for plunging Rangers into crisis. Yet Ally McCoist’s men ultimately managed to avoid having their League Cup hopes flushed away by Queen’s Park at Airdrie’s Excelsior Stadium on Tuesday night. A Kris Boyd double either side of a Tony Quinn equaliser, the Carntyne plumber capitalising on a Steve Simonsen howler, was eventually enough to put Rangers into a second-round tie against Inverness Caledonian Thistle. To the rescue: Striker Kris Boyd made sure Rangers progressed to round two in the Scottish League Cup . Double: Boyd heads in his first to put Rangers on their way to a tense 2-1 win against Queen's Park . With the third-round draw coming on Wednesday, they may be presented with the prospect of a truly tantalising reward for getting past the Premiership side. But they’ll certainly have to improve on this performance in order to overcome Caley Thistle. On a night when other teams were playing their second-round ties, Rangers were clearly eager to make up for lost time in this delayed match. Queen’s Park, decanted from their traditional home while wondrous athletics venue Hampden is ‘restored’ to its natural state as a football ground, were under pressure from the opening moments, only the brilliance of goalkeeper William Muir preventing the loss of a goal after just two minutes. Nicky Clark’s cross from the left flank was perfect for the inrushing Lee McCulloch, whose full downward header was somehow diverted off target by the diving Muir. Rangers had signalled their intent and, after Arnold Peralta — recalled in place of David Templeton who was relegated to the bench — had sent a 25-yarder fizzing wide, Muir quickly found himself beaten. Howler: Steve Simonsen fails to clear a cross which led to Tony Quinn scoring Queen's Park's equaliser . There was nothing the goalie could do as Nicky Law was given time and space to pick out a cross from the right wing, Boyd then doing what he does best, somehow making himself isolated amid a forest of leaping bodies to score with a perfect header. There were just seven minutes on the clock and, in truth, such an early opener should have been the cue for an absolute onslaught by the visitors. Indeed, if Lewis Macleod’s headed ‘goal’ a minute later hadn’t fallen foul of an offside flag, it would have been hard to see a way back for the Spiders. Yet they survived. They clung on despite seeing little ball. They watched as Rangers kept possession, spread play, whipped in crosses, took the odd shot and gradually ran out of momentum. The small knot of home fans thought for a moment that they’d be cheering a penalty when Vinnie Berry — one of three Queen’s Park players signed from Clydebank Juniors in the summer — went down under a Macleod challenge inside the box. No dice, said referee Alan Muir, who booked Paul Woods for diving just seconds later. They would not be denied their moment, though. Unimpressed: Rangers boss Ally McCoist was left frustrated by their performance versus the League Two side . All it took was one speculative free-kick into the box — and one horrendous misjudgement by Simonsen, the former Everton and Dundee goalie getting nowhere near the ball and watching in agony as the mighty Quinn’s looping header completed its slow-motion arc into the net. Simonsen spoke just last week about the social media shock he’d experienced after his Scottish Cup semi-final error last season. Best stay off Twitter for another wee while, Steve. Not that the big Englishman would have been alone in attracting the ire of Rangers fans during a fairly unimaginative first half. It was hardly surprising that they ran out late for the second 45; if McCoist didn’t have a lengthy lecture to deliver, there would have been something very wrong. There was certainly more tempo about the visitors after the break, Bilel Mohsni stooping to head an effort off target just two minutes in. It was no more than a half chance, Clark having drilled the ball in from close range on the right after a free-kick play had set the Queen’s defence back on their heels. Their second goal arrived from similarly broken play, a series of crosses and balls into the box causing havoc before Peralta’s chipped cross found an unmarked Boyd ready, willing and more than able to nod the ball into an empty net. Simple. Close: Bilel Mohsni stoops in for a header which nearly led to a goal for McCoist's Championship side . And surely a sign that the storm had been weathered by a superior team who would now add a third or fourth by way of insurance. Nice theory. In practice, while Clark saw a point-blank shot blocked by David McGregor and Macleod sent a low drive cracking off the foot of the post, the visitors continued to be troubled by their hosts. From Mohsni gifting possession by trying to be too clever, to Simonsen grinning in gratitude as Ross McPherson directed a back-post header straight at him, there was nothing comfortable about Rangers’ lead. Still, in Macleod, they had the best player on the park. He was involved in all their brightest moments, including a corner that saw Mohsni’s goal-bound heard cleared off the line by Berry late on. Looking forward to the next round, Rangers boss McCoist said: ‘Let’s be honest, Caley are the in-form team in the country at the moment. They’ve not lost a goal. We will certainly have to be more disciplined — but the good thing is we get a chance to play them at home now. ‘I was pulling my hair out in the first half, with the number of free-kicks we were giving away. Our lack of discipline was a big concern. ‘For their goal, once Simo comes, he has to get it. I’m not sure he had to come, I’ll watch the video tomorrow. ‘There are positives to be taken, the biggest one being that we now have a home tie against Inverness. But there are negatives I need to look at.’","Ally McCoist's side struggled to 2-1 victory against Scottish League Two side .

"By . Sami Mokbel . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . Queens Park Rangers have appointed former England manager Glenn Hoddle as first-team coach. The former England manager has made a dramatic return to football at Loftus Road and QPR boss Harry Redknapp wants him to help implement a new 3-5-2 formation. Hoddle, who is a replacement for Steve McClaren - who left to manage Derby last season - said: said: 'I am really pleased to take up Harry’s offer to come in and work with him, Kevin and Joe. VIDEO Scroll down to see 'Sherwood: The game has moved on since Hoddle managed' Dream team: Glenn Hoddle (right) will work with Harry Redknapp at QPR . Keeping his hand in: Hoddle worked for ITV at the World Cup in Brazil over this summer . 'After winning promotion last season, the first aim at QPR is to stay in the Premier League and I am looking forward to helping play my part as we try to achieve that. 'I have always loved coaching, and I can’t wait to meet the players, get on the training pitch and get to work.' Redknapp, who played a 4-4-2 system last season, wants to replicate Louis van Gaal’s 3-5-2 formation during the forthcoming campaign. And the QPR manager wants Hoddle, who is well versed at playing with three at the back, to play a lead role in the transition. Redknapp said: 'I am really pleased to bring Glenn in. I have been really lucky in the last couple of years to have had Steve Cotterill, Steve McClaren and Wally Downes work with us. They all did a fantastic job here. 'I spoke with the chairman about the possibility of bringing Glenn in, and he thought it was a great idea. 'Glenn will be great. He has a brilliant knowledge of the game and will be fantastic out on the training ground with the players. 'He is a hugely-respected coach and, like Steve, has managed his country. I decided if I was going to bring somebody in, I was going to go for somebody who was top class, and that’s what Glenn is.' Tactical guru: Hoddle used the 3-5-2 formation during his time as England manager . New man: QPR signed Jordon Mutch for £6million last week but lost to PAOK at the weekend . Hoddle, who will work alongside Kevin Bond and Joe Jordan, used 3-5-2 during his managerial spells at Swindon and Chelsea, and also deployed the system intermittently during his time with England. The former Tottenham manager even played as a sweeper during the closing stages of his career. The switch is expected to see Rio Ferdinand play as a sweeper with Steven Caulker and Clint Hill flanking the former England star. Even though Hoddle hasn’t coached for eight years — since he left Wolves — the 56-year-old made no secret of the fact that he wanted to get back into football. He was linked with a return to White Hart Lane following Andre Villas-Boas’s sacking last season, but Daniel Levy handed the reins to Tim Sherwood. To keep his hand in, Hoddle has set up an academy to develop talented youngsters, as well as working as a television pundit for Sky Sports and ITV. But he has accepted a role that will see him return to football on a day-to-day basis, although he will be permitted to continue his punditry work as long as it does not conflict with club duties and will be allowed to leave Loftus Road should a desired management role crop up. Ferdinand’s ability on the ball will be vital to QPR’s transition to a new formation. Hoddle worked with him during his time with England, giving the 35-year-old his full international debut in 1997. The 3-5-2 formation is set to make a comeback with Glenn Hoddle at QPR to implement the system he helped popularise in the 1990s. Hoddle used the formation for England’s 1998 World Cup campaign, having tested it out while manager of Chelsea. At Loftus Road, Rio Ferdinand will play the sweeper role that Hoddle had in mind when signing Ruud Gullit at Stamford Bridge in 1995. Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United revolution will also showcase the system, as he used it to guide Holland to third place at this summer’s World Cup finals in Brazil. Top-level football is saturated with teams playing 4-2-3-1, so playing three at the back allows a side to outnumber the opposition forwards and go man-for-man in midfield while possessing the added attacking threat of two men up front. Width is provided from two wing backs who must be able to contribute in both halves, with United’s signing of Luke Shaw seeing the teenager pencilled into the left-sided role at Old Trafford. New signing Mauricio Isla, who has arrived on a season-long loan from Juventus, is expect to fill the right wing-back slot and former Arsenal defender Armand Traore is the leading contender to play left wing-back. Redknapp still hopes to strengthen his squad before next weekend’s opener against Hull. He wants a defensive midfielder and the club have explored a potential deal for West Ham’s Momo Diame. Redknapp is also interested in former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Lassana Diarra, who is currently at Lokomotiv Moscow.

Hooper is open to leaving Carrow Road ahead of Monday's transfer window in an attempt to continue playing in the Premier League. Queens Park Rangers and West Ham also have a firm interest in the former Celtic striker, but the arrival of Neil Warnock has seen Palace throw their name into the hat.

The 34-year-old Brazil goalkeeper has a contract until 2016 but he has not been part of the club’s plans for more than a year. Benfica opened initial talks in July prior to the World Cup but were struggling to agree his £100,000 a week wages.

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . Hearts midfielder Jamie Walker and Hibs defender Lewis Stevenson have both accepted two-match bans for their part in the stormy end to Sunday’s Edinburgh derby. As the clock ran down in a 2-1 win for Hearts at Tynecastle, Easter Road midfielder Stevenson’s nasty tackle provoked an irate response from Walker who went for his opponent and deliberately clashed heads. Neither Stevenson nor Walker were punished by referee Willie Collum for the flare-up that happened in the dying embers of an ill-tempered game that also saw Hibs midfielder Scott Robertson and Hearts attacker Osman Sow red-carded. Flare up: Jamie Walker (R) and Lewis Stevenson came together during the Edinburgh derby . In the dock: Both players face a two-game suspension after being charged by the Scottish FA . After reviewing the footage of the late flashpoint, however, new Scottish FA compliance officer Tony McGlennan took retrospective action on Tuesday by issuing a fast-track notice of complaint against the duo – offering each an immediate two-game suspension. Stevenson was charged with a breach of disciplinary rule 200, exhibiting ‘serious foul play by stamping or attempting to stamp on an opposing player, namely Jamie Walker’. Walker, for his retaliation, was charged with breaching the same disciplinary rule 200 by exhibiting ‘violent conduct by headbutting or attempting to head-butt an opposing player, namely Lewis Stevenson’. Poor timing: Lewis Stevenson clipped Jamie Walker during a tackle at Tynecastle . Demolition derby: Jamie Walker and Liam Craig (L) had to be separated at full time . Hearts quickly announced that Walker would not be contesting the ban, with a spokesman saying: ‘Heart of Midlothian has today received a notice of complaint from the SFA against Jamie Walker for an incident that took place in Sunday’s derby win over Hibs. The club has accepted the offer of a two-game ban and will not be appealing.’ The 21-year-old Tynecastle midfielder will now miss Wednesday night’s Petrofac Training Cup tie at Livingston then sits out of Saturday’s top-of-the-table Championship clash with Raith Rovers at Stark’s Park. Hibs duly followed suit in refusing to contest the charge and the 26-year-old long-serving Easter Road player will now sit out of his side’s home Championship match with Falkirk on Saturday and then a Scottish League Cup tie against Dumbarton in Edinburgh on Tuesday.

"By . Robin Cottle for MailOnline . Former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell doesn't think Alexis Sanchez is the man to fire the Gunners to title glory. The Chilean forward arrived in a £30 million deal from Barcelona this summer and boss Arsene Wenger hopes he's the man to help end a 10-year Premier League title drought. But speaking to the Weekend Sports Breakfast on talkSPORT, Campbell claims Wenger hasn't addressed the deficiencies in his squad - namely a reliable goalscorer and midfield powerhouse. Leading the line: Kevin Campbell doubts whether Alexis Sanchez will solve Arsenal's problems . He said: 'Alexis Sanchez is a fantastic signing but I don't think the problems have really been addressed. 'I like the Calum Chambers signing but he's going to take a bit of time to bed in. The two main problems were the centre of the pitch and a noted goalscorer and they haven't addressed that problem. 'If you struggled against the top boys and you don't address the problems, then you can't expect a different result in my opinion.' As well as Sanchez, Wenger has brought in Chambers in for £12 million from Southampton and French defender Mathieu Debuchy arrived for £10 million from Newcastle. Big ambitions: Sanchez (right) and team-mates Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini will be hoping to prove Campbell wrong this season . On the ball: Sanchez (right) takes on Yannick Bolasie on his Premier League debut . New kid on the block: Sanchez is expected to be a key player for Arsenal this season as they chase glory . But attempts to sign World Cup winning Real Madrid midfielder Sami Khedira has failed and Campbell, who also played for Everton and Nottingham Forest, said the Gunners are still short in the middle of the park. And Campbell questions whether the former Barcelona man, who scored 21 goals in all competitions for the Catalans last season, has the physical attributes to lead the line in English football. He said: 'Coming from Barcelona is different to playing in the Premier League. 'Sanchez is going to get a lot more physical pressure against him, so I don't see him as being a centre forward who can take the hits. 'I don't see him being that central striker.' Arsenal verdict: Kevin Campbell takes on Oldham during his time with the Gunners and will follow his former club keenly this season . Campbell scored 59 goals in 228 games for the Gunners from 1988 until leaving for Nottingham Forest in 1995.

"By . Joe Kay, Associated Press . Serena Williams finally got the one that always managed to somehow slip away. And she did it so convincingly that she's thinking another title could be coming soon. Williams needed only 62 minutes to beat Ana Ivanovic 6-4, 6-1 on Sunday in the Western & Southern Open for a personal breakthrough. She'd never even reached the finals in Cincinnati until last year, when she fell apart and lost to Victoria Azarenka on a third-set tiebreaker. No wobbles this time. After getting broken in the first game, she took control with her serve and took advantage of Ivanovic's sloppy play, improving to 5-0 in finals this year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch match highlights . Hands on the prize: Serena Williams shows off her new Cincinnati title after defeating Ana Ivanovic . Powerful forehand: Williams' power proved to be too much for Ivanovic in Ohio on Sunday . 'Definitely my best performance of the summer,' she said. 'Hopefully not the last. 'This is definitely a level that can take me to the (U.S. Open) title. I still have a lot of work to do. It's definitely a better level than I've played all year, to be honest.' Ivanovic was treated for a stomach ailment during her nearly three-hour win over Maria Sharapova in the semi-finals on Saturday night. She didn't have much left against Williams, who dominated with her serve. Williams had 12 aces. 'Only?' Ivanovic said. 'It felt like way more.' The only other event that Williams has played six times without a title is Sydney. She finally got her win in Cincinnati with the help of a good match-up. Williams is 7-1 in her career against Ivanovic, with the only loss coming at the Australian Open this year. Although their last three matches have been close - all going three sets - this one was one-sided after the first few games. Ecstatic: Williams was delighted to finally win a trophy that has eluded her for several years . Proud moment: A gleaming Williams shows off her Cincinnati title alongside Ivanovic . VIDEO S.Williams bt Ivanovic 6-4 6-1 . 'I felt like she was dominating,' Ivanovic said. Williams developed a stiff back that limited her serve in the semi-finals. She moved stiffly at the start Sunday, double-faulted in the first game and was broken - an ominous sign. But she started moving better and took control with her serve, pulling even at 3-3. She clinched the set when Ivanovic double-faulted twice in a row. The back problem came into play in the second set. Williams winced after a serve in the opening game and arched her back. She stretched her back a few times between points and played through it. And Ivanovic couldn't take advantage. 'I felt it a little bit in the second, but I just was so excited for this final and to be in the final,' she said. 'I just really felt like I had nothing to lose. So I was able to relax.' Despite the loss, Ivanovic will move back into the top 10 in the WTA rankings with her strong showing in Cincinnati. 'It's the biggest final I've been in in a while. It feels good to be part of it,' she said. 'There are still a few points in my game that I feel I need to work on for the U.S. Open and also for the end of season. Definitely exciting times.'","American tennis star Serena Williams won her first Cincinnati title .

"By . Matt Barlow for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Alexis Sanchez fired anxious Arsenal into a 17th successive Champions League campaign before Arsene Wenger claimed his £30million Chilean can lead the line until the end of the year in the absence of Olivier Giroud. Sanchez struck just before half-time with his first goal since his transfer from Barcelona and the Londoners clung to their lead despite finishing the game with 10 men after Mathieu Debuchy was sent off. Wenger confirmed striker Giroud had surgery on a broken ankle on Wednesday and will be out for up to four months but resisted the clamour to make an emergency dash into the transfer market. Main man: Alexis Sanchez scored the only goal of the game as Arsenal beat Besiktas to reach the group stage . Opening his account: Sanchez scored his first goal for Arsenal since his £30million move from Barcelona . 'Sanchez can play his whole life at centre-forward,' said the Arsenal boss. 'I bought him as a striker, not only to play on the flanks. He had a good game. He was mobile, dangerous and has shown as well he has great fighting spirit, qualities that will be very important in the Premier League. 'He produced the performance we wanted, technically, tactically and mentally. We needed that against a good team. It was nervous in the last 10 minutes when we were down to 10 men.' As for Giroud, Wenger added: 'He had surgery for a broken tibia. He be out of action for three to four months and will be capable of playing again in the Premier League by the end of December. You will ask me straight away who we will buy and I say: At the moment, no one. 'I know if you want to make anybody happy you should just buy all these players, but what is important is the performance on the pitch, and the solidarity we have shown tonight. 'If you look at the players on the bench and those injured, you will know we have players. You cannot just buy when a player is injured.' Blow: Olivier Giroud will be out until at least the end of the year after breaking his ankle against Everton . Patient: Giroud watched Arsenal's victory from the comfort of his home as he recovers from surgery . He rejected the idea of a swoop for Radamel Falcao from Monaco or Daniel Welbeck from Manchester United and rejected claims by the agent of Nikola Zigic that he wanted to recruit the former Birmingham striker. 'Who?' said Wenger, when asked about Zigic. 'Zigic? No.' Instead, he applauded the spirit of his team, having finished both legs of the play-off with 10 men. Aaron Ramsey as dismissed in the first leg in Istanbul, and Debuchy last night for two bookings. 'Debuchy went for the ball and played the ball,' said Wenger, who also admitted his team were lucky not to conceded a penalty for a tackle by Jack Wilshere. 'There was no intention to make a bad foul or stop the counter-attack. And he won the ball. 'Maybe the referee was on the other side of the player and thought he made a foul, but we dealt with it. Nervously, it was very difficult. But we dealt with it.' Besiktas boss Slaven Bilic congratulated Arsenal but fears they do not have a genuine chance of winning the Champions League. 'Football is a very strange sport but I don't think so,' said Bilic. 'They are far away from the big guns.' No go: Arsenal had been linked with a move for Monaco striker Radamel Falcao .

"By . Sean Gallagher for MailOnline . Harry Redknapp has confirmed he will sign a new two-year contract extension at QPR. The 67-year-old, who has been at the club since November 2012, led the club back to the Premier League at the first attempt following relegation last season, and despite a poor start this time around chairman Tony Fernandes is set to offer him a new deal. He said: 'I've been offered a new contract and it's just a case of me signing it now - which I will. I probably won't read it anyway - I'll just sign it.

Either way it'll get done as Tony has been asking me about it for a while. 'I'm happy at the club and want to stay here. The Premier League is where I want to be and it's where we will be next season as we will stay up.' The former Tottenham boss also quashed rumours he was set to leave the club following reports Tim Sherwood was being lined up to replace him adding: 'It's absolute rubbish, we've played two games, he (Fernandes) wants me to sign a two-year extension. 'I knew it was going to be a difficult start. We have bought good players in but we need time to gel. It takes time.' Redknapp also confirmed that unsettled midfielder Adel Taarabt will be involved against Sunderland on Saturday with his future still very much up in the air. He said: 'Adel will be involved tomorrow. He done well on Wednesday at Burton so he'll be in the squad for the Sunderland game.' The maverick playmaker has been pushing for a move away from Loftus Road all summer with AC Milan his preferred option, but so far a move has failed to materialise with his £65,000-per-week wage packet and buy-out clause proving to be the stumbling blocks.

All over: Alejandro Faurlin could miss the rest of the season after suffering a serious knee injury . Charlie Austin (hamstring) missed the 4-0 loss at Tottenham last weekend but could be involved on Saturday as Redknapp is likely to recall a number of players who sat out the Capital One Cup defeat to Burton. Provisional squad: Green, Murphy, Hill, Dunne, Ferdinand, Onuoha, Caulker, Yun, Simpson, Traore, Isla, Henry, Barton, Fer, Mutch, Hoilett, Phillips, Wright-Phillips, Taarabt, Austin, Remy, Zamora. Sunderland . Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet faces a series of selection decisions ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to QPR. Poyet has no fresh injury concerns, but having made six changes for the Capital One Cup second round victory at Birmingham in midweek, has options at his disposal. Eyeing recall: Jack Rodwell (right) scored his first Sunderland goal against Manchester United last week . Costel Pantilimon, Billy Jones, Liam Bridcutt, Adam Johnson, Jordi Gomez and Jozy Altidore all started at St Andrews, but Vito Mannone, Patrick van Aanholt, Lee Cattermole, Jack Rodwell, Will Buckley and Steven Fletcher will hope for recalls at Loftus Road. Provisional squad: Mannone, Pantilimon, Jones, Van Aanholt, Brown, O'Shea, Vergini, Roberge, Cattermole, Bridcutt, Rodwell, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Giaccherini, Mavrias, Wickham, Fletcher, Altidore, Graham. Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Loic Remy scored his first Premier League goal at Loftus Road in this fixture two seasons ago. Wes Brown scored the winning goal (in the 89th minute) the last time Sunderland won a league game at QPR (December 2011). QPR have yet to score a league goal this season and have scored just once in their last eight Premier League games overall. Harry Redknapp has won just two of his 14 Premier League home games as Rangers boss (D5 L7). QPR have scored 37 goals in 39 Premier League home games since August 2011. Going down fighting: Despite going on to be relegated, QPR defeated Sunderland 3-1 at Loftus Road in their previous clash in 2013, with Andros Townsend (front) getting on the score sheet . Loic Remy has made a league-high 18 touches in the opposition box this season, one more than Swansea have in total. Harry Redknapp won four of 22 Premier League games in his ill-fated spell at Southampton; so far he has won four of 27 in the top-flight with QPR. The players to feature for QPR this season have a combined 2307 Premier League appearances; only Everton (2896) & Man Utd (2334) have more. Loic Remy has scored QPR’s last three Premier League goals, but the most recent one came in May 2013. After scoring five goals in three Premier League games, Connor Wickham has now gone five Premier League appearances without one.","Alejandro Faurlin could miss rest of season for QPR with knee injury .

"By . Nick Mashiter, Press Association . Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert has challenged Fabian Delph to become a part of England's new era after labelling midfield duo Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard irreplaceable. The manager also revealed he will hold talks with the 24-year-old midfielder over his future after his first international call-up. Delph is in the England squad for the friendly against Norway and the Euro 2016 qualifier with Switzerland next month. Challenge: Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert has urged Fabian Delph to grab his opportunity with England . Selected: Delph has been impressive for Aston Villa and was called up to the England squad on Thursday . It follows the retirement of Gerrard and Lampard, who won a combined 220 caps for their country. Michael Carrick and Adam Lallana are also injured, leaving Delph to plug the gap in midfield for the Three Lions. And Lambert insisted former Under-21 international Delph must not be held back by expectation after the exit of Lampard and Gerrard. 'Whoever follows those two lads - I don't think you ever replace those two brilliant footballers,' he said. 'No two players are the same, it's a new generation, a new time for England. 'You have got to have players coming through to hit those heights. 'Maybe England never won anything with them but they were top players. To fill that is a big ask for anyone. Irreplaceable: Lambert believes replacing Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard is a big ask for any player . VIDEO Lampard announces England retirement . 'Comparisons are unfair because the two made over 200 appearances for England. It is a new generation, hopefully he will do well and stay in that squad. 'I hope he can handle it. If he goes in and feels overawed it will be hard for him. But he's earned the right to be there so everyone thinks good enough, now it is up to him to go and show what he can do. 'If you can't handle it in football it can hurt you mentally.' Delph only has a year left on his contract at Villa Park, with any deals put on hold over the summer while the club searched for a new owner. Hopeful: Lambert hopes Delph can handle the pressure of being an England international . Lambert has also been linked with Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley as he targets signings before Monday's transfer deadline. But he will talk with Delph, who joined Villa from Leeds for £6million in 2009, about his own future. 'As soon as you are getting picked for England things escalate, so we will have to sit and see what he thinks himself,' he said, ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League visit of Hull. 'This has been thrown at him. England will be first and foremost on his mind. 'The way Fabian is his contract won't enter his head at the moment, he's playing well.'","Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph called up to England squad .

"New Liverpool signing Mario Balotelli spoke to the club's official website after moving to Anfield from AC Milan in a £16million deal on Monday. Mario, welcome to Liverpool Football Club. How do you feel to have signed for the club? I'm very happy. We've been talking about coming here and I'm happy to be here. Done deal: Liverpool signing Mario Balotelli poses with the shirt after switching to Anfield in a £16million deal . What attracted you to the challenge here at Liverpool? Liverpool are one of the best teams here in England. The football is very good here. It's a great team with young players, and that's why I came here. You've received an incredible reception from the fans here already. How has that made you feel? I didn't expect it because I've always been playing against Liverpool. Whenever I played against Liverpool, the fans weren't nice with me but that's normal - it's football! Now that I play for Liverpool, I can see the expectation in people. They're very happy and that makes me very happy at the same time. Unexpected: Balotelli admitted Liverpool fans weren't nice with him during his time playing for Manchester City . You've previously described playing at Anfield as a 'beautiful experience' to Fabio Borini. Did you enjoy playing at Anfield as an opposing player? No - but when I play with this team [at Anfield], it's going to be nice for sure. To play here for Liverpool excites me, but if you're an opponent it's difficult. For someone still so young, you have a lot of experience - can you use that to help what is a young team here at Liverpool? I maybe have a little bit more experience than other players - if I can help them, I'm happy to help them. Pen to paper: Italy international Balotelli has signed a three-year deal with the Reds worth £125,000-a-week . Liverpool are back in the Champions League after five years out, and you have got great memories of the competition; you were Inter Milan's youngest ever goalscorer in the tournament and you also won it with them in 2010. Are those experiences something you can bring to Liverpool to help in the Champions League this season? I always start a competition wanting to win it. We will see. I want to win another Champions League for sure, because the Champions League wasn't all mine, I was in a team. I want to take this team to the Champions League. You have been away from English football for around 18 months - how do you feel about coming back? I'm happy to be back because I left England and it was a mistake. I wanted to go to Italy but I realised it was a mistake. Regret: Balotelli admits it was a mistake to leave England when he left Man City for AC Milan in January 2013 . Do you feel English football suits you better? English football is generally better. English football is beautiful. We know you are going to take the No.45 for Liverpool. Can you explain the significance of that shirt? When I first played three or four games with Inter Milan, when I was young, I had No.45 because the numbers for young players were from No.36 to No.50. I took No.45 because I was joking that four plus five is nine - and I scored in all four games. It brings me luck and that's why I've always kept No.45. This deal has moved very quickly over the last few days, so has it sunk in yet that you are a Liverpool player? No. When I meet the team, start training with them and start my first game, I will realise. For now, I have just seen the city. Superstition: Balotelli insists wearing the No 45 shirt brings him luck on the pitch . How much are you looking forward to meeting your new teammates? I am going to meet them soon and I'm excited. Liverpool are in action tonight against your former club, Manchester City - are you going to attend the game? I'm going to be watching the game. I would love to play but I can't, so I'll support them from the stand. Finally, what are your ambitions here at Liverpool? What do you hope to achieve? As much as I can.

"By . Frank Pingue, Reuters . Roger Federer's hopes of adding to his record grand slam haul got a boost as he beat Spain's David Ferrer 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 to win the Western and Southern Open title in Cincinnati on Sunday in the last key U.S. Open build-up event. It marked the sixth Cincinnati title for the Swiss second seed and, coming off last week's runner-up finish in Toronto, will give him plenty of confidence going into the year's final grand slam. Federer recorded the only break of the opening set for a 5-3 lead over his sixth seeded opponent and then did well to fight off four break points in the next game before wrapping up a tidy first set in 31 minutes.

Federer found his groove in the decisive set, getting his second break of serve to open a 3-1 lead and then capping the match with yet another break to remain undefeated in 16 career meetings versus Ferrer.

"By . Adam Shergold . Joel Campbell produced a performance to catch the eye of Arsene Wenger as Arsenal’s Under 21 team thrashed West Brom at the Emirates. The Costa Rica World Cup star is trying to stake his claim as the man to lead Arsenal’s line in the absence of the injured Olivier Giroud and he did himself no harm here with an energetic performance full of flair and creativity. The only thing missing for Campbell was a goal but that didn’t matter as a stunning Daniel Crowley free-kick and a hat-trick from the outstanding Chuba Akpom gave the Gunners the Under 21 Premier League points. VIDEO Scroll down for Joel Campbell ears get a flicking during Arsenal training . Impressive: Joel Campbell was selected to play against West Brom Under 21s at the Emirates . Hat-trick: Chuba Akpom proved he has a bright future ahead of him after scoring three of Arsenal's four goals . Arsenal: Deyan Iliev; Hector Bellerin, Stefan O’Connor, Semi Ajayi, Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill; Francis Coquelin, Abou Diaby (Gedion Zelalem 46), Isaac Hayden (c), Daniel Crowley (Ainsley Maitland-Niles 76); Chuba Akpom, Joel Campbell . Substitutes not used: Kristoffer Olsson, Matt Macey (GK), Tafari Moore . Scorers: Crowley 2; Akpom 30, 63, 69 . West Bromwich: Jack Rose; Wesley Atkinson, Shaun Donnellan, Kyle Howkins, Tom Smart; Danny Barrow (Rees Wedderburn 64), Liam O’Neil (c), Samir Nabi (Ryan Pace 72), Bradley Garmston; Adil Nabi, Kemar Roofe . Substitutes not used: Alex Palmer (GK), Chike Kandi, George Cleet . Scorers: Howkins 78; Roofe 90+2 . Referee: Lee Vanamore . Attendance: 1,469 . On the day Wenger confirmed that Giroud will be out until the New Year with a serious ankle injury sustained in Saturday’s draw at Everton, Campbell was given a chance to get a full 90 minutes under his belt before possibly being pressed into first-team action. It must have been a little surreal for the 22-year-old playing in front of an audience of just 1,500 at the Emirates two months after he dazzled out in Brazil. But he showed his maturity in an encouraging display and looked threatening every time he touched the ball. He couldn’t resist the odd flick or step-over but the real highlight came when he slipped in Akpom for his hat-trick goal with a lovely chipped through ball. It is a dead cert Wenger will start with £30million summer signing Alexis Sanchez up front against Leicester City on Sunday but the boss will be pleased Campbell is in good touch and ready to step in, especially with Lukas Podolski tipped to leave the club and Yaya Sanogo still unconvincing. Full-back: Hector Bellerin has his work cut out if he is to get ahead of Mathieu Debuchy into the first team . Indeed, on this form, it might be worth throwing Akpom into that mix too. The 18-year-old has been impressive on a regular basis at this level for the past 18 months. Arsenal find themselves in the second division of the reformatted Under 21 league but they showed plenty of class against a poor Baggies side. Abou Diaby also made an appearance for 45 minutes in midfield as he continues his latest recovery from injury and there was a game too for forgotten man Francois Coquelin. It didn’t take long for the hosts to establish a lead and it came from a majestic swing of Crowley’s boot. Everyone expected him to send the free-kick, wide on the left, into the middle but he went for goal and deceived goalkeeper Jack Rose with his impudence. Like our dedicated Arsenal Facebook page. Chance: Joel Campbell will want to prove himself while Olivier Giroud is out injured . 8min His first meaningful involvement - collects the ball in the middle, spreads it wide to Daniel Crowley and gets it back. Tries to lift the ball over the goalkeeper but it floats wide of the far post . 11 Sharp shimmy to the right to receive a ball from Hector Bellerin and then play the right-back in - leads to a corner . 16 Calling out for the ball as he darts into the box but Crowley ignores his run and shoots instead . 21 Good chest control on the edge of the box and a left-footed shot that is dragged wide of the mark . 39 Gets into a good forward position down the left-channel to roll a low ball in towards Akpom. Cleared for a corner . 40 Bends a shot wide of the target after cutting in from the right-hand side . 44 Burst down the right, step-over and then cuts back to play 60-yard ball to other side . 54 Sparking run of step-overs to get past three West Brom defenders before a tame side-footed shot that rolled wide . 58 Instigated a move deep in midfield, drives through the middle and then plays the ball out wide with the outside of the boot. Leads to a chance for Crowley, which is saved . 69 Played an excellent chipped ball to set Chuba Akpom free inside the box, allowing the livewire striker to complete his hat-trick . Campbell’s first real involvement came on eight minutes when, after trading passes with Crowley, he lifted a shot that beat Rose but landed wide of the far post. Crowley looked excellent and a swirling cross-cum-shot nearly caused more embarrassment for Rose, before Diaby’s hit from 20 yards took an awkward deflection and bounced just over. Akpom found some space inside the box and fired off a shot that Rose clawed away, while Campbell dragged a left-footed shot wide following a nice piece of chest control. A second Arsenal goal seemed inevitable and it arrived on the half-hour. Crowley’s corner caused all kinds of carnage and after Semi Ajayi’s shot had been repelled, the ball was work across for Akpom to steer home. Gunners captain Isaac Hayden tested Rose early in the second half and the goalkeeper also used his legs to block a powerful Crowley strike. But there was nothing the Baggies defence could do about Akpom as he lost his marker to score the third with a towering header from Hector Bellerin’s inviting cross. Still they weren’t satisfied and Campbell’s lofted through pass for Akpom to complete his treble with a composed low finish was the highlight of the evening. West Brom did manage to pull one back when Kyle Howkins sent a free header past Deyan Iliev from a Rees Wedderburn cross and they gained another in stoppage time when Kemar Roofe lifted a shot high into the corner. But it was Arsenal’s night and for Wenger, there were plenty of reasons for encouragement. Celebrations: The Arsenal Under 21 side celebrate Dan Crowley's goal at the Emirates .

"By . Jim Van Wijk . England defender Gary Cahill has the 'captain's profile', according to Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho. Roy Hodgson is next week set to name his squad for the upcoming friendly against Norway at Wembley and opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland. England will have a new captain following the decision of Steven Gerrard to retire after what was a hugely disappointing World Cup in Brazil. Leader: Jose Mourinho said that Gary Cahill has what it takes to be a future captain of England . Hodgson has indicated he already knows who will take on the armband, with both veteran midfielder Frank Lampard - who left Chelsea to join New York City FC before being loaned back to parent club Manchester City - and forward Wayne Rooney, the new Manchester United skipper, the leading candidates. While not wanting to draw any direct comparisons between the contenders, Mourinho has no doubts centre-back Cahill could perform the role if asked. 'I don't want you to say that I prefer Gary in front of Rooney or Gary is better than Rooney. No, I just speak about Gary and Gary can be a captain,' said Mourinho. Chelsea: Mourinho said that the reason he is not captain at Chelsea is that there are more senior players . 'He is not the captain here because we made the decision that John (Terry) is the captain for many, many years, and after that it is about years at the club, so Petr Cech, Didier Drogba, Branislav (Ivanovic), (John) Obi Mikel, so he has lots of guys in front of him. 'So is he going to be Chelsea captain? I hope not, because for him to be (Chelsea) captain then five or six of the other guys they are not able to play. 'But can he be a captain, do I feel he has the captain's profile? Yes.' International: Gary Cahill is capped at U20 (3 caps), U21 (3 caps) and senior (27 caps) level for England .

"By . Binky Felstead . I don't know about you, but when the sun's out and the mercury is rising, my inclination is to go make-up free. I like to feel the sun on my skin (I'll be wearing sunscreen, natch) and to take advantage of the vitamin D boost I get from its rays. There are summer occasions, however, that demand a properly made-up face. So this week I've called on the expert help of the fabulous Daniel Sandler – make-up artist extraordinaire and all-round beauty guru – to conjure the perfect summer party look. 'It's the ideal time of year to experiment with bright make-up colours – they never go out of fashion,' explains Daniel. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . When it comes to a summer party look, Daniel Sandler recommends lots of bright colours . 'This year it's all about corals, pinks and peaches – all fantastic for summertime. The look I've chosen focuses the bright colour on lips and cheeks, paired with smoky party eyes. Gorgeous!' Begin with a light base like Vichy Aera Tint Pure Cream Foundation for a fresh, dewy finish – or if your skin's a bit more blemish-prone, opt for a foundation with a bit more coverage such as Clarins Skin Illusion Foundation. THE EYES . Draw your eyeliner pencil along the upper lash line. Daniel used black, but you could try purple, dark green or inky blue for an added hit of colour. Look out for a waterproof eyeliner pencil (especially in the summer months when it's hot and sticky) as this will help the lock the colour in place – try Clarins' excellent Waterproof Eyeliner Pencil. Draw the colour from inner to outer corners of your eyes, and then along the lower lash line, extending out into a flick. You can also try a liquid liner such as Guerlain Liquid Eyeliner for a more defined winged effect. Daniel recommends only a light dusting of blusher for the summer months . Binky says she likes to be bare-faced during the summer months but there are a few occasions when you need to be made-up - a summer party being one . Now take Butter London's Wink Eye Pencil in Cheerio, a luscious golden hue, and draw it along the water line to make your eyes really pop. Finally, volumise upper and lower lashes with a coat of Daniel Sandler Waterproof mascara. THE CHEEKS . 'My go-to summer colour for Binky is my Daniel Sandler Watercolour Blusher in Acid,' reveals the make-up artist. 'You only need the tiniest bit of this brilliant liquid blusher, blended onto the cheek bones with a wide, flat brush, and the colour will last all night long.' If you're a bit more daring with your make-up, try the Watercolour Blusher in the vivid orange Trip shade for a super-cool rave-style look. Daniel has created a look that isn't too clogged with make-up so that your skin can still breath in the summer months . A lip stain is great for when it's hot as it isn't as sticky as a high shine gloss . THE LIPS . You can also use Daniel's Watercolour Blusher on your lips as a lip stain, simply dabbed on with your fingertip. It's simple, easy and super-effective. Thanks Daniel! You can pick up Daniel Sandler beauty products – and tons of other amazing beauty treats - at online boutique Escentual.com. The great thing about this look is that it doesn't use too many products and is quick to apply - so my face doesn't feel heavily clogged with make-up and yet I look glam enough for a special summer party.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When Michael Tomlin married his girlfriend of nine years, he decided it was a good opportunity to celebrate the other love of his life – Vimto. The 31-year-old and bride Liz, 27, were toasted with the soft drink rather than champagne and guests were asked to wear purple to match it. Mr Tomlin and his ushers wore purple ties and cufflinks, and the priest at St Gregory’s Church in Bollington, Cheshire, donned a purple sash. Tables at the reception were dressed with vases and candle holders in the same colour, as well as Vimto sweets. Michael and Liz Tomlin are so obsessed with Vimto that they decided to tie the knot with a themed ceremony dedicated to the soft drink . The groom from Oldham, who developed his obsession as a child, said: ‘When I met Liz I even took her to a Vimto statue … for our first date and I proposed to her at the same spot … it was only fitting it played a major part in our day … I just love the stuff.’ His best man even incorporated the couple’s favourite drink into his speech by jokingly exclaiming: 'this speech is sponsored by Vimto.' On their honeymoon to Lanzarote, Michael was so concerned that they might not have any of his favourite tipple on sale in the Canary Islands, he put some cartons in his luggage to take over with him. Tables at the reception were dressed with vases and candle holders in the same colour, as well as Vimto sweets . Mr Tomlin and his ushers wore purple ties and cufflinks, and the priest at St Gregory's Church in Bollington, Cheshire, donned a purple sash .

My gran always make me Vimto and it is a special memory for me. 'When I met Liz I even took her to a Vimto statue in Manchester city centre four our first date and I proposed to her at the same spot four years later. 'The fact is we wanted a Vimto themed wedding because it had played such an important role in our relationship. Vimto is at the centre of our hearts, so it was only fitting that it played a major part in our day. When I first met I was telling her the history of the drink and she loves all things history.'

When Mr Tomlin met his future wife, he took her to a Vimto statue in Manchester city centre four their first date. He proposed to her at the same spot four years later . We were going to meet up in Manchester city centre for our first date and I just didn’t know where to take her until I thought of the Vimto statue. 'I just wanted to go there and get away from all the madness of the city and watch the trains go by and look at the statue. It is such a nice and special place.'

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Britain's biggest baked bean fan is having 60 images of his favourite food tattooed on his head. Barry Kirk, 59, who officially changed his name to Captain Beany, is getting the ink to mark his 60th birthday next month and hopes the act will raise more than £3,000 to help a three-year-old girl with cerebral palsy. Mr Kirk walks through his hometown of Port Talbot, South Wales, dressed in a bright orange costume, has transformed his house into a 'Baked Bean Museum of Excellence' - and even ran for Parliament as Captain Beany. Baked Bean Museum of Excellence: Barry Kirk, 59, has transformed his living room into a museum filled with an impressive collection of novelty baked bean items - and tins of all sizes . Fundraising: Mr Kirk, pictured right in his Captain Beany costume, has asked people to sponsor £60 for each one of the 60 beans he will have tattooed on his head to help Marlie-Grace Roberts, pictured left . Planning it out: Mr Barry and tattoo artist Craig Jenkins plan out his new ink. He hopes to raise more than £3,000 to help Marlie-Grace Roberts, pictured with her grandparents, who was born with cerebral palsy . His love of the food started in 1986 when he spent 100 hours sat in a bathtub filled with baked beans for charity. Now Mr Kirk is appealing for people to donate £60 for each one of the 60 beans he will have tattooed when he turns 60 on 23 September. He hopes the drive will raise more than £3,000 to help a three-year-old girl with cerebral palsy walk unaided. Mr Kirk said: 'Having the bean tattoos is just another step in my lifelong love of the baked bean. 'It all began way back in 1986, when I spent 100 hours sitting in a bathtub of beans for charity. 'I thought I could adopt a superhero persona like Batman or Superman and live out my passions in real life. So I became Captain Beany and even stood for Parliament. 'Now everywhere I go people can see that I am full of beans - with the tattoo on my head.'

When Mr Kirk is not busy being Captain Beany and curating his Baked Bean Museum of Excellence, he works as an impersonator of U2's Bono. Tattooist Ash Robinson said: 'My first thought when he came and told us what he wanted to do, was: ""Oh My Goodness"".

"By . Binky Felstead . Festival fever is well and truly upon us, and although I missed out on Glastonbury as I'm filming in the Big Apple, I'll definitely be digging out the Hunters on my return as there are some awesome smaller UK events coming up I simply can't miss. Last year top celebrity makeup artist Daniel Sandler created a gorgeous boho-style floral festival look for me, which you can check out here. This year I've enlisted Daniel's help once more, but this time we've gone for something altogether different – a Gwen Stefani-esque party look that blends Nineties grunge-glam and futuristic cool. Here's how we did it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky was inspired by Gwen Stefani for this year's festival look . GET THE LOOK . Step 1 - Ace of Base . At a festival, you need make-up that will make your skin look fresh and radiant as well as last all day. Daniel recommended the Clarins BB Cream – the coverage is enough to conceal any pesky blemishes while still allowing your skin to breathe. It's easy to apply too – simply blend into the face with your fingertips, making sure to take the product down the neck to avoid tidemarks. Step 2 - Paint It Black . A black kohl pencil (waterproof, of course!) is a foolproof festival essential – whatever the look you're going for. So next, Daniel lined my eyes generously with his Daniel Sandler Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet. 'Festival make-up needs to have a little bit of edge,' he explained, 'so to give the eyes a bit more attitude I smudged the liner out slightly with my Lip Brush for a slept-in effect that screams rock'n'roll.' Binky enlisted the help of make-up artist, Daniel Sandler for her bold and bright beauty look . Step 3 - Glitter Bug . Daniel then loaded some of the Too Faced Glamour Dust Glitter Pigment in Pink Fire onto a smudger brush and gently dabbed it over my eyelids. The contrast of the shimmering lilac hue and the black eyeliner provides the perfect blend of girly and edgy. He also applied some to the tops of my cheekbones for a super-cool holographic effect and across my lips to create the illusion of a fuller pout. The mantra 'less is more' certainly doesn't apply to festival make-up – so feel free to go as wild as you like. A little does go a long way with this pigment, though! Step 4 - Fuschia Flutter . Instead of using a boring black mascara, Daniel decided to mix things up a bit and go for a vivid fuschia shade - in the form of Dior's Addict-It Lash Mascara – to really make the lashes pop. Daniel says that festival make-up has to have a bit more edge and attitude than a day-to-day look . A statement look like this calls for suitably bold brows, so Daniel defined and darkened mine using his Brown Velvet waterproof eye pencil, sweeping the colour through my brows with a small brush for added volume. Step 5 - After Glow . To give my skin a rosy-radiant glow, Daniel swept his Daniel Sandler Radiant Sheen Illuminating Face Powder across the apples of my cheeks. This pretty palette offers the perfect blend of golden and peachy tones to instantly perk up even the most hungover of complexions - plus the dark shade doubles up as a great contour colour. Finally, Daniel painted my pout with Guerlain Rouge G Lipstick in Gemma – a bold lilac shade providing a matte but moisturising wash of colour. Binky opted for a bright fuchsia shade of mascara to make her eyes really pop . So there you have it; a rave-ready festival look that will certainly make sure you stand out from the crowd - thanks Daniel! I also thought I'd share with you my top five festival essentials in case any of you are off to a festival soon and are a bit stuck on what to pack in the beauty department. You can get everything I've mentioned from Escentual.com. Binky gives you her top five festival beauty essentials . Klorane Oatmilk Gentle Dry Shampoo Spray – the ultimate festival hair saviour . Bioderma Photoderm Bronz Invisible Sun Mist SPF 50 – sunburn at a festival is no fun! Dior Skinflash Radiance Booster Pen – conceals dark circles like a dream . Guerlain Meteorites Bubble Blush – easy to apply for a healthy flush of colour . Anna Sui Lip Palette – a different ultra-pigmented lip shade for every night . See you next week, .

"By . Martha Cliff for MailOnline . An anonymous food critic has spent the past two years travelling the UK in hunt of the perfect full English. The amateur reviewer's opinion has become so well respected that the sought-after stickers he rewards for a good review are being displayed like Michelin stars in restaurants. The Fry Up Inspector, as he is known as on his blog, rewards restaurants, cafes and tea rooms with a sticker printed with 'Inspector recommended' if he awards the breakfast a score of 8.5 or higher. A secret reviewer has been travelling the UK sampling Britain's favourite breakfast, the full English. Pictured here, Louis' Deli , Norwich, which received nine out of ten in a rave review . The self-appointed taste tester is no stranger to the full English, having rated over 300 breakfasts from across the country. The inspector publishes his reviews on his blog, which has attracted more than 750,000 views since he started it. The faceless diner started his quest for the perfect breakfast after a particularly bad and overpriced offering at a chain hotel. Since then, his dedication has seen him post a review complete with his own photos every time he eats his morning meal out. The reviewer began his mission in his hometown of Norwich and has since samples fry-ups in London, Northampton, Cambridge, Brighton and Bristol. His devotion to dining has even lead him to other breakfast items overseas. The hard-to-please reviewer has even sampled  Parisian versions of his favourite morning meal. The Fry Up Inspector has rewarded twelve of his best reviews to restaurants in his home town of Norwich, such as this one, the Street Cafe, Norwich, which was rated a nine out of ten . Although the inspector has gobbled almost a year's worth of the fried dish he claims that he has maintained a slim physique. The middle-aged-man says that he prefers to stick to a diet of fish and steamed veg during the week and only indulges in a fried breakfast at weekends. Despite his packed schedule, The Fry Up Inspector squeezes in his day job working with adults with learning difficulties and his reviews serve purely as a hobby. The critic says that when it comes to a good review it isn't just down to taste, he likes to feel welcomed by the staff and for the restaurant to have a good atmosphere. Pictured here, the breakfast at Bill's, Brighton 8.5/10, which also got a nine out of ten . His success could be down to his involvement in subject as he arguess that so many other restaurant reviews are completely impersonal. 'I was getting frustrated as other websites reviewing breakfasts had such little information on them. 'I wanted to write something far more detailed to make sure people would know when places were open for breakfast, what was on the menu and what the experience was like. 'I learnt that a lot of people go out for breakfast at least a couple of times a month and with so many places to choose from it can be a bit of a gamble so my blog helps them locate the places that are going to be good. 'I think I must have hit a gap in the market, I do push it on social media, but I think it's also down to growing a fan base.' Not impressed: The Bowthorpe shopping centre cafe only received 3.5/10 (left) and Cafe 6. Rendezvous, Norwich, received a poor 2/10 . The inspector judges each breakfast on six key aspects- first impressions, service, ingredients, presentation, taste and value. To reach a final score for the breakfast the inspector adds together each individual score for the six elements and averages them out. When it comes to rewarding a restaurant with a good review he looks for a great atmosphere and friendly waiters. 'I want simplicity in the ordering process. I also think about the vibe of the place. 'You could have the most amazing breakfast in the world, but if the staff are rude and make you feel like you shouldn't be there then you don't have a good experience.' Restaurants who receive an 8.5 or more are able to request one of The Food Inspectors much sought after Inspector Recommended stickers . When reviewing taste the critic has a meticulous process and doesn't let any mistake go unnoticed. 'I focus on how it's cooked, anything that's not quite right, items that don't have any flavour. 'My wife prefers a vegetarian breakfast. This is quite handy as I can get a photo of the veggie breakfast too.' Restaurants can be sure to expect a negative review if staff are unwelcoming, use crockery that has seen better days or get his order wrong. Any breakfast which scores 8.5 or higher means the establishment can contact his blog to ask for one of his circular recommended stickers. For the Norwich-born reviewer, it appears that when it comes to a good breakfast there is no place like home, with 12 restaurants bestowed with the sticker in his birth town in the past two years. His best reviews have dished out compliments such as 'out of this world' and 'cooked perfectly.' Some restaurants have not received the same flattery and can probably expect a dip in sales being described as 'a sorry sight' and compared with 'chewing on foam'.","The Fry Up Inspector has gained a reputation as an expert on breakfast .

"By . Stephen Johns . French trees, giant redwoods and Japanese red cedars should be planted in Britain’s forests as traditional oaks struggle with climate change, according to research. Experts have warned that the composition of our woodlands must change to survive rising temperatures, frequent droughts and diseases. Research found that unless action is taken, Britain’s forests could shrink by more than 40 per cent by 2080 because of climate change. Oaks such as these apparently struggle with climate change, according to research . Foresters are being advised to plant more trees capable of flourishing in warmer temperatures such as the Japanese red cedar, and giant redwood trees from America, instead of oaks, pines and spruces. More varieties of these trees from the continent will also be grown as well as species from Britain in the Victorian era such as Hornbeam, small leaved lime and aspen trees, which are also set to return after not being planted for the last few hundred years. Different varieties of oak and pines that exist in the UK will also be planted. Scientists at the University of Twente, in the Netherlands, and at Forest Research, the research agency of the Forestry Commission, estimate that forests could be reduced by 42 per cent by the 2080s because of climate change. They studied spruce, pine and oak, which make up 59 per cent of British forests, and found that new species would be needed to maintain woodlands in the future. John Weir, from the Forestry Commission told The Daily Telegraph: ‘Trees from the continent are used to surviving higher temperatures and drought. ‘In Bristol for example we may be looking at the end of the century at weather similar to that in the Loire Valley. The French are very good foresters and we can look to source trees from there.’ In Bristol for example we may be looking at the end of the century at weather similar to that in the Loire Valley (above) Giant redwoods like this one should be planted . He said native oaks and spruces will not disappear from Britain’s forests, but different varieties will be used. He added: ‘The current oak is not doing very well and we need to look at the range of oak trees available. ’There are a lot of native trees that we stopped using because they were not making money. For example during the war most of the forests in England were oak.’ He also said there is also a need to diversify Britain’s forests to ensure trees had the best chance of surviving pests and diseases. Luc Boerboom, assistant professor at the University of Twente, said: ‘In the Netherlands we have much less forest production than Great Britain. 'However, we too can expect change: our grandchildren will walk and bike into a different kind of forest than we do now.’ Giant redwoods are already planted across the UK and are more likely to be used on the east coast which will be warmer, according to Mr Weir. He said: ‘There will be hot drier summers and that’s what we have to react to. ‘For example the North York Moors are likely to have drier summers, which would not suit spruces in the future. ‘In the South East we might use some of the southern European varieties.’","Oaks apparently struggle with climate change, according to research .

"By . Corey Charlton . London gang members are drawing up lists of women to rape as a means of extracting revenge on their rivals, it has been claimed. Attacks on the women, who are usually related to rival gang members, are reportedly taking place in daylight  - often when the victims are walking or travelling home. The attacks are targeted - with sisters, girlfriends and other relatives of rival gang members selected and then preyed upon as means of intimidation or revenge. Police have said sexual violence against women by gangs is a priority now gun and knife offences have declined . The revelation of the use of sexual violence by gangs comes as a judge recently called for an end to a 'Medieval turf war' on the streets of London. Claire Hubberstey, chief executive of Safer London Foundation, told The Observer gangs were using sexual violence to intimidate or inflict pain on rivals in the same way they used dangerous dogs. 'Criminals are clever, they know if they are caught carrying weapons they face a lengthy sentence; it's risky carrying a gun. 'The use of sexual violence is the same sort of thing as having a dangerous dog; it creates fear, it's non-traceable and they are also taking advantage of low rape convictions even when there are witnesses.' Sitting at the Old Bailey, Judge John Bevan, QC, described a long-standing feud between two gangs as a 'Medieval turf war' The 'sket lists' - taken from a pejorative street slang word for a woman - are distributed among gang members via the Blackberry Messaging service. As a result, police now say sexual violence is a 'top' priority. The revelations follow an Old Bailey trial in which two men were found guilty of murder in what . Judge John Bevan QC described as a long-standing feud between . warring Turkish gangs. Calling for the families to end the . fighting, the judge said: ‘The use of the streets of this city for . fighting a Medieval turf war using hired hands as hitmen is as . intolerable as it is unacceptable.’ Earlier this year Scotland Yard warned some of London's most dangerous gangs were expanding their criminal activities across the UK, with around 54 gangs from the capital thought to have stretched into other towns and cities. Police described the criminal operations as like businesses, with areas selected depending on the demand for the gang's activities, and whether other gangs operate in the area.","London gangs draw up lists of rivals' girlfriends and relatives to target .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A gang of armed robbers who repeatedly fired a stun gun at a pawn shop manager in a £43,000 raid have been jailed for a total of 94 years. David Sadiku, 41, and Kelly Day, 36, posed as a couple selling a Rolex watch to con their way into a pawnbroker’s in Ilford, Essex. Once inside Maxcroft Securities Ltd, Sadiku pulled out a gun and dragged manager Naom Margolin out of his office while Day let fellow gang members - Paulius Strasunskas, 27, Francis Carbon, 32, Amjit Bharj, 47, and Aamir Kayani, 31 - into the shop.

He then put a stun gun to the face of one of the female . members of staff and fired it at point blank range, the court was told. Threats: Paulius Strasunskas, 27, (left) shouted 'Where's the f****** money' at frightened staff,  while Francis Carbon, 32, (right) told at employees at Maxcroft 'I will f****** kill you' as he demanded they empty their desks . ‘She heard a . cracking noise and felt a lot of pain. What had happened is he had used . the stun gun on her face,’ said prosecutor Kerry Broome during the nine week trial. ‘Her face was swollen and painful. ‘There was no need at all for anyone to administer a Taser, led alone to the face. ‘He also administered the same gun to Mr Margolin’s head and neck area.’ Two customers were also forced to hand over wedding jewellery they were attempting to retrieve from the pawnbroker’s. On June 25, just a few days before the attack at the pawnbroker's, the gang had tried to raid a Muslim wedding celebration after it had been announced in the local paper. One wedding guest was Tasered in the face by the gang, but still managed to stop them from entering the home.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . TOWIE star Bobby Cole Norris has today thanked the 3,000 people who have signed the bone marrow donation register after he issued an appeal to help save his mother's life. Co-stars and a host of reality TV stars rallied behind the star of The Only Way Is Essex, after he revealed his mother and 'best friend', Kym Norris was diagnosed with leukaemia. Doctors have told the family her best hope is a bone marrow transplant, prompting the 28-year-old to launch his desperate plea. The charity Anthony Nolan told MailOnline the #SaveBobbysMum appeal has generated 3,000 donor sign-ups in the last week - a 750 per cent increase on the same week last year. TOWIE star Bobby Cole Norris told MailOnline he has been 'overwhelmed' by a surge in people signing Anthony Nolan's bone marrow donation register after he launched an appeal to find a donor for his mother last week . The 28-year-old tweeted his thanks to people who have already signed up, but urged more to follow suit, revealing they have yet to find a match for his mother Kym Norris, who has been diagnosed with leukaemia . 'I'm . completely overwhelmed by people's kindness,' Bobby told MailOnline. 'Both me and . my mum were over the moon to hear about these huge increases in . potential donors - any one of the people who has signed up after hearing . our story could end up saving a life. 'It’s given us something positive . to focus on at a really difficult time. But . we still have a long way to go. 'My mum is one of thousands of people . who are still waiting for the news that a matching donor has been found. 'It’s a really tough time and we’ve got a long road ahead, but I will be . supporting Anthony Nolan every step of the way.' Among those supporting Bobby's campaign, are Geordie Shore's Charlotte Crosby and Vicky Pattison, who tweeted urging fans to sign up. TOWIE's Jessica Wright and Chloe Sims have also tweeted photographs of themselves with a #SaveBobbysMum sign. And Katie Price, Mark Wright, Joey Essex, Lauren Goodger, Sam Faiers, Lauren Pope, Anthony Costa and Michelle Heaton, have also called on their fans to act to help save the lives of those waiting for a bone marrow donor. Ms Norris, 54, pictured with Bobby as a child, went to the doctors a few weeks ago, complaining of feeling lethargic. Tests revealed she had fallen victim to the blood cancer . Bobby, an only child, said he is devastated at his mother's diagnosis. The 54-year-old is currently in hospital and is receiving intensive chemotherapy twice a day to try and treat the disease . TOWIE star Gemma . Collins said: 'You have been so strong I love you lots #SaveBobbysMum.' While Bobby’s ex-boyfriend Harry Derbidge wrote: 'Stay strong babe, we are . all here for you.' Charlotte Crosby spoke out earlier this year, urging people to sign up. She said: 'I just thought – ""It’s so easy, why doesn’t everyone do this?"" 'I was quite shocked that young lads are so underrepresented on the register though. 'I'm completely overwhelmed by people's kindness... But we still have a long way to go' - Bobby Cole Norris . 'Come on lads, just sign up online and spit into a tube! I’m doing it, and I just hope one day I have the chance to save a life.' Last week Bobby launched his appeal for bone marrow donors to come forward and save the life of his mother, who is fighting blood cancer. The Anthony Nolan website crashed immediately following his emotional plea on This Morning, and the charity has today revealed that 3,141 people have joined the register online in the past seven days - a 750 per cent increase compared to the same week last year (when just 370 people signed up). On the day of his This Morning appeal, 817 people signed up – a 2050 per cent increase compared to the same day last year. Dental receptionist Ms Norris, 54, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia only a few weeks ago, news that turned Bobby’s world ‘upside down’. TOWIE co-stars, including Jessica Wright, pictured, have tweeted their support for the #SaveBobbysMum appeal . And Chloe Sims joined TOWIE stars past and present, including Mark Wright, Joey Essex, Sam Faiers, Lauren Goodger and Gemma Collins, in supporting their co-star Bobby . Geordie Shore star, Charlotte Crosby has shown her support for Anthony Nolan, calling on her fans to sign the bone marrow donation register . Doctors told Bobby and his family last week that his mother's best hope is a bone marrow transplant to try and treat the disease . Bobby appeared on ITV's This Morning to urge people to sign up to the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register in a bid to help find a donor for his mother . The 27-year-old fashion designer said: 'My mum is my best friend, I'm devastated' He told MailOnline, said: 'I feel completely helpless right now, but all I can do apart from being there for mum is to try to raise awareness of the Anthony Nolan register, particularly to young people who are much more likely to go onto donate and save a life. 'For the donor, it’s probably just a case of sitting still for a few hours while the stem cells are taken out of their blood. 'But for me, and for families like mine, it’s the difference between having my mum around or not. It’s everything.' Young donors aged 16 to 30 are urgently needed by the Anthony Nolan charity, which runs the UK bone marrow register. The charity particularly needs young men to come forward, as they’re the most likely to donate but only make up 14 per cent of the register. Bobby said: 'Thank you to every single person who has joined the register this week and pledged to save the life of my mum and others in the same position – you are all amazing. 'We now really need more boys to sign up as they’re so underrepresented on the register – so ladies, please get your boyfriends, brothers and sons on board and together we will save lives.' Fashion designer Bobby tweeted his appeal for a bone marrow donor for his mother, launching the #SaveBobbysMum hashtag . Ann O’Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan, said: 'What a week it’s been. 'It’s been truly humbling to see the outpouring of support Bobby has had from fans, co-stars, friends and celebrities, who have rallied behind him at this difficult time and told a combined audience of millions about the simple but life-changing act of donating stem cells. 'Stars and fans from all three of these popular shows have joined the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register, including Bobby himself, meaning they could one day save a life from blood cancer. It’s an incredible and selfless example to be setting young people.' People aged 16 to 30 and in good health can join the Anthony Nolan register here.

GCHQ, the British intelligence agency,  has set a new challenge to find to find the best computer hackers in the country - who could one day protect Britain from real cyber terror attacks. It has launched an online game to test cyber warriors’ abilities to stop a fictional attack – and top scorers will be invited to take part in secret face-to-face reconnaissance missions. GCHQ has set a new challenge to find to find the best computer hackers in the country, who could one day protect Britain from real cyber terror attacks . Winners of past missions have gone on to work for GCHQ as a real operative, MailOnline can reveal. Would-be spooks can register online for the chance to take part. In the game, called Assignment: Astute Explorer, they must protect a fictitious aerospace technology company threatened by imminent attack from imaginary cyber terrorists called The Flag Day Associates. As part of the elaborate game, players can watch a ‘threat video’ posted by The Flag Day Associates on YouTube - again, mimicking real-life situations that operatives are faced with. Hundreds of people have already analysed a made-up hard drive belonging to Ebell Technologies – an imaginary aerospace and electrical engineering company, which makes military and civilian aircraft and wind turbines.

Hundreds of people have already analysed a made-up hard drive belonging to Ebell Technologies – an imaginary aerospace and electrical engineering company, which makes military and civilian aircraft and wind turbines. The story goes that Ebell are concerned about the threat of an imminent attack and have asked GCHQ operatives (the public playing the game) to assess the scale of the threat. For this part of the challenge, players must identify vulnerabilities in snippets of code hidden on the hard drive and explain how they could be exploited – as well as suggest how they could be fixed. Now, people are being encouraged to take part in the next part of the Cyber Security Challenge UK game, which is designed to give members of the public a chance to experience what it is like to be a GCHQ operative. The story goes that Ebell is concerned about the threat of an imminent attack and have asked GCHQ operatives (members public playing the game) to assess the scale of the threat. Players must identify vulnerabilities in snippets of code hidden on the hard drive and explain how they could be exploited – as well as suggest how they could be fixed. A source told MailOnline that the task has been devised using technology used by GCHQ in real life to make the experience as realistic as possible. High flyers in the task will get the chance to take part in a reconnaissance meet up at secret locations around the UK. ‘In the upcoming face-to-face competition, winners of the GCHQ contest will be paired into teams to fight a real-time ""cyber-attack"" on simulated critical infrastructure,’ he said. They will use laptops to ‘hack’ into encrypted systems and uncover details about ‘people behind the masks’ in the imaginary scenario. While the competition aims to give lots of people a taste of what it takes to work for the British intelligence service, it is also a chance for individuals to attract the attention of employers. Previous high flyers have gone to to work for the British intelligence agency GCHQ in Cheltenham (pictured) Past participants took part in a  a realistic cyber-attack on the London Stock Exchange – in the historic setting of the Cabinet War Rooms in Westminster . Past face-to-face challenges have included teams competing to hack into an airport’s CCTV networks and take control of a remote-controlled military drone. In another scenario, high-flying hackers had to work together as a team of 42 to prevent a realistic cyber-attack on the London Stock Exchange – in the historic setting of the Cabinet War Rooms in Westminster, which were used during World War Two. While the competition aims to give lots of people a taste of what it takes to work for the British intelligence service, it is also a chance for individuals to attract the attention of employers. 'Astute Explorer is an ingenious game from GCHQ which will not only provide an enjoyable challenge but will test skills that are in high demand by employers in this sector,' said Stephanie Daman, CEO of the Cyber Security Challenge. 'I would encourage anyone with an interest in how IT systems and the information they hold can be protected to sign up and give it a go.'","GCHQ launched game to test public's ability to stop fictional online attack .

"By . Jemma Gillard for MailOnline . After being threatened with a knife and subjected to daily physical and verbal abuse for six years, one girl has fought back against her bullies and now become a successful model. Frankii Wilde, 27, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne was so scared of the bullies that she spent her break times hiding in the school building and even contemplated suicide. But after being scouted by a modeling agency at the age of 17 and becoming a top pin-up model, Frankii has now had the last laugh. She even receives messages from the bullies who tormented her at school and now want to befriend her. Scroll down for video . Next top model: Frankii Wilde, 27, modelling for a recent shoot was bullied at school for being 'fat and ugly' Fighting back: But after being scouted by a modeling agency at the age of 17, Frankii has become a top pin-up model . She says: 'The bullies made me feel so awful about myself and I felt I couldn't achieve anything. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would become a model. 'In a way, what I suffered through school has given me the motivation and strength to do what I do now. I hope I've proved people wrong.' Brave Frankii, who was born Charlotte Million, had been targeted by bullies for as long as she could remember. She added: 'I was raised by my mother and our family never had much money. I was teased by the other kids for wearing hand-me-downs.' Early days: Frankii when she was six-years-old was subjected to daily physical and verbal abuse for years and even threatened with a knife . Then and now: Frankii pictured left, at school where the bullying escalated, and, right, now becoming a top pin-up model . The bullying escalated when Frankii began attending Sedgefield Community College in County Durham at the age of eleven. She explains: 'When I started secondary school, things took a turn for the worse and the other kids would call me 'ugly' and 'fat'. 'I would get food thrown at me in the canteen on a daily basis. Break times were the worst. It got to the point where I would hide in the school building, instead of going outside, so I wouldn't have to face the bullies. 'They would play some horrible pranks on me such as sending me fake Valentine's Day cards from boys I had a crush on. I would be excited, but then discover it was from the kids who were tormenting me at school.' 'They would also create new email addresses and send abusive messages to me.' The past: The bullying escalated when Frankii (pictured above during her school days) began attending Sedgefield Community College in County Durham at the age of eleven . Frankii explained: 'When I turned fifteen, the bullies threatened me with a knife on the school run. I was so traumatised and scared. 'I can't even describe how much I hated school then. It didn't matter what I did, I couldn't escape the horrendous bullying. 'I became depressed and started seeing a councilor. I was also self-harming and regularly contemplated taking my own life.' Natural beauty: Frankii even receives messages from the bullies who tormented her at school and now want to befriend her . Turnaround: In college, Frankii started experimenting with the 1940s and 50s look and began receiving complements for her looks . 'My mother was beside herself about what I was happening. She was always down at school or on the phone, trying to sort things out. But there was nothing she could do. In spite of the abuse that was thrown at her every day, Frankii excelled in Art and Design. She was thrilled when she was awarded a bursary to study A-Level photography at Cleveland College of Art and Design in Linthorpe, Middleborough. Finally leaving her high school oppressors in behind, Frankii thrived in college. It was around this time that she started experimenting with the 1940s and 50s look and began receiving complements for her looks. 'During our photography classes, we used to model for each other and my tutor was forever saying I had great bone structure.' Naked truth: In spite of the abuse that was leveled at her in class every day, Frankii excelled in Art and Design . 'I pretty much dismissed it because I had a very low opinion of myself, as people had always been so cruel about the way I had looked. 'Bullying conditions you to regard yourself in a certain way and to this day, I still struggle with negative thoughts. 'However, I began putting some self-portraits on my Myspace page. Photographers as well as a local modeling agency contacted me requesting that I pop along to a casting day.' 'The agency put me on their books and I was soon being paid for my first shoot. I was a little worried that the photographer would think I was ugly or not good enough. But I ended up getting repeat bookings.' New fans: Frankii's modelling career has aken off and now she has 24,000 followers across social media . Frankii's modeling career quickly took off and her stunning, distinctive looks have kept her working for the last decade. She also runs her own photography business called 'Frankii & Gerry's Retro Photo & Film Studio' business with Glamour Bunny founder, Gerry Roxby. She says: 'Not in a million years did I ever think this would happen to me. I've modeled for countless lingerie, fashion and make-up brands. 'I have almost 24,000 followers across all social media. I'm so grateful to my fans, they're so lovely and positive. 'I run a great business too and have a wonderful boyfriend, Tom. I try to remember that all of that past bullying doesn't matter anymore.' Modelling ambition: Frankii's distinctive looks have kept her working for the last decade. She also runs her own photography business called 'Frankii & Gerry's Retro Photo & Film Studio' Inspiration: Frankii hopes that her story inspires and helps other victims of bullying . Due to her success, Frankii often receives messages from the school bullies that made her life a misery and now even want to befriend her. 'I reckon they think I'm some sort of celebrity now. A few of the bullies have messaged me on Facebook saying things like 'Wow you look amazing, I can't believe how well you're doing now!' or 'Wow, haven't you changed since school!' 'It's very positive but I'm a bit shocked that they try to contact me after what they did. No-one has ever said sorry. I usually reply with a brief 'Thanks' and try to move on.' Frankii hopes that her story inspires and helps other victims of bullying. 'I want to tell other kids who are being bullied that it gets better. Hang in there and use that hate for good. Use that hate as rocket fuel for your life.' Brave Frankii had been targeted by bullies for as long as she could remember, but now turned her life around to become a successful model .","Frankii Wilde, 27, was subjected to physical and verbal abuse for six years .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Tractor beams evoke scenes from Star Trek and Star Wars, but scientists have swapped lasers for water to create a similar device. Australian physicists have developed technology that works in liquids and involves manipulating currents with wave generators. During tests, scientists used it to pull a ping pong ball towards the generator, as well as push it away. Experts hope that one day the technology will be used to control oil spills, or even fleets of ships. Scroll down for video . Physicists at the Australian National University have created a tractor beam on water that controls flow patterns using wave generators (pictured). This means the researchers can move objects at will, without touching them. The 'beam' could be used to control oil spills, for example . Last year, a team from the University of St Andrews and the Institute of Scientific Instruments (ISI) in the Czech Republic built a laser capable of moving tiny spheres of polystyrene floating in water. The team fired a laser through a lens, which then went to a mirror that bounced the beam back. The reflected beam interfered with the incoming beam. Meanwhile, the scientists suspended polystyrene spheres in water directly in the path of the laser beams. The beams held the spheres in place vertically, and any pulling or pushing force moved the spheres to the left or to the right. Changing the way the light is polarised changes the direction the spheres move. The work could also reveal new insights into how waves on beaches occur. The technology was created by Professor Michael Shats and Dr Horst Punzmann from Australian National University's Research School of Physics and Engineering. ‘We have figured out a way of creating waves that can force a floating object to move against the direction of the wave,’ said Dr Punzmann. ‘No one could have guessed this result,’ he said. Using a ping pong ball in a wave tank, the researchers used the size and frequency of the waves, when viewed through a slow-motion camera, to work out their different size and frequency. They were then able to manipulate these waves to move the ball in whichever direction they wanted. Advanced particle tracking tools, developed by team members Dr Nicolas Francois and Dr Hua Xia, revealed that the waves generate currents on the surface of the water. Using a ping pong ball in a wave tank, the researchers used the size and frequency of the waves, when viewed through a slow-motion camera, (pictured) to work out their different size and frequency. They were then able to manipulate these waves to move the ball in whichever direction they wanted . ‘We found that above a certain height, these complex three-dimensional waves generate flow patterns on the surface of the water,’ Professor Shats said. ‘The tractor beam is just one of the patterns, they can be inward flows, outward flows or vortices.’ ‘It’s one of the great unresolved problems, yet anyone in the bathtub can reproduce it. We were very surprised no-one had described it before.’ The team also experimented with different shaped plungers to generate different swirling flow patterns. ‘This work on the tractor beam began shortly after we realised the particle motion on the surface, as determined by waves, is by far too complex to handle with any existing mathematical theory,’ said Dr Punzmann.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Any worried pet owner who has spent days hanging posters, making phone calls and knocking on neighbors' doors hopes there's a more scientific way to find a lost dog. That has become a reality thanks to facial recognition technology that has been tested to successfully reunite a pet with its owner. A website scours an online database to search for distinctive features on dogs and matches them up with animals that are reported lost. Scroll down for video. Scientists at the University of Utah create system to find lost dogs (shown). Their website called FindingRover.com matches dogs with an online database. It studies distinctive features on dogs such as eyes and snout. This is then correlated with dogs at a shelter to reunite them with owners . The website is called FindingRover.com and was recently used to successfuly reuinte a pet at San Diego County . Animal Services with its owners. For . centuries, dogs have been man's best friend. But it turns out canines . would drop humanity for artificial intelligence in a second if offered a . treat. A . study in Animal Cognition found that dogs interacted with robots . similar to how they would with humans if those robots seemed 'social'. The . researchers conducted their experiment by having a robot point out . hidden food to a dog and measuring their reactions to the robots . directions. But the dogs were better able to find the hidden food when the robot had a human face on it's monitor, and acted 'socially'. The . website keeps a database of photos from the three county shelters and . tries to match eight distinctive facial markers on dogs with images . uploaded by users searching for lost pets. Eyes and noses are important . areas that differentiate pooches, including eye size and their position . near the snout. FindingRover.com founder John Polimeno wants to expand the photo database to improve the odds of more missing dogs being reuinted, with shelters elsewhere set to sign on. He's also showing it to rescues, veterinarians and dog groups and is visiting other countries. Every dog entering San Diego County's . three shelters is added to the photo database. Daniel deSousa, the . system's deputy director, says the program can work two ways: . Someone can find a dog, take its picture and sends it to the database, . where a match generates a notice to the owner. The owner then can call . the good Samaritan and arrange a pickup. The other method is that dogs coming in to the shelters have their photos run against the database. If there's a match, the owner gets a call. Here founder of the smart phone application Finding Rover John Polimeno is seen during a news conference in San Diego.  In May, San Diego County Animal Services became the first shelter system in the country to adapt the facial recognition plan . The . technology powering Finding Rover was built by Dr Steven Callahan and Dr John . Schreiner of the University of Utah's software development center. They . found the eight markers on dogs are far fewer than the 128 points on . the human facial recognition program. 'People . are sort of uniform, the shape of their faces, skin tones, all their . eyes, noses and mouths are in the same general location,' Dr Callahan said. But dogs' eyes and snouts are in different places. It's . difficult to measure accuracy, Dr Callahan said, but if there are 100 dogs . in a database, a top-three match would be hit 98 percent of the time. 'It . worked surprisingly well, better than I thought it would. I had low . expectations,' Dr Callahan said.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The latest leaked images of the iPhone 6 appear to give weight to a number of separate rumours that have been doing the rounds for months. They show a protruding camera, for example, which was first reported on in April, recessed volume controls, which were hinted at during the start of the month, and an embedded logo. The images are purported to be of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model and were leaked by Russian designers Feld and Volk. Scroll down for video . The leaked images were posted by Moscow designers Feld and Volk and claim to show the rear shell (pictured) and an embedded logo, alongside a cable that is said to be used for the home button. The images are purported to be of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model, which is expected to launch on 9 September . Reports of a protruding camera originated from Chinese site Weibo in April after an anonymous supplier working at Foxconn leaked the information online. Apple is expected to launch its next-generation iPad and iPhone models at an event in September. Analysts believe Apple is working on two versions of different sizes for its iPhone 6, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally - the same size as the HTC One. A larger version is also expected to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5. In April, Taiwan-based Commercial Times similarly referenced a 2mm-thick battery. The iPad Air is 20 per cent thinner than previous models, and Apple is expected to launch an equally super-thin iPhone, dubbed iPhone Air. This is expected to be the smaller of the two handsets. Feld and Volk’s image is a close-up shot of this supposed raised ring, and could be used to attach additional lenses to the iPhone 6, as suggested in a patent also revealed in April. Elsewhere, the recessed volume controls on Feld and Volk’s image are similar to those seen on the leaked images of the iPad Air 2 earlier this month. It is likely that if Apple chooses to make a tweak, such as this, to one new flagship device, it will appear on both. Another image taken by Feld and Volk shows an embedded Apple logo that the designers claim is scratchproof, and made of Liquidmetal alloy.

"By . Mark Prigg . The same strain of killer bacteria that caused the Black Death and . spread around the world in the mid 1800s may have helped finish off the . Roman Empire, researchers have claimed. DNA analyses of skeletal remains of plague victims from the 6th century AD found traces of  Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, has already been . linked with at least two of the most devastating pandemics in recorded . history. Now researchers believe it also caused the Justinianic Plague of the sixth to eighth centuries, which killed . more than 100 million people - and some historians believe contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. An artist's recreation of the Byzantine Empire under Justinian I - which was decimated by the plague . The Plague of Justinian (AD 541–542) was a pandemic that afflicted the Eastern Roman Empire, including its capital Constantinople. At its peak, 5,000 people per day in Constantinople died from it, killing half the population. From there, the plague moved east and west, becoming antiquity's most . lethal known pandemic. Half a century after it began, between 25 million . and 100 million in Europe and Asia had died. The plague's social and cultural impact during the Justinian period has been compared to that of the Black Death. Some historians say the damage was so great to the Persian and Byzantine . empires that it made them vulnerable to the Muslim conquests of the . next century. However, while it has been claimed as one of the greatest plagues in history, but until now researchers have not know  what form of plague it was. The Great Plague, which lasted from the 14th to 17th centuries, . included the infamous epidemic known as the Black Death, which may have . killed nearly two-thirds of Europe in the mid-1300s. The Modern Plague struck around the world in the 19th and 20th . centuries, beginning in China in the mid-1800s and spreading to Africa, . the Americas, Australia, Europe and other parts of Asia. However, until now researchers have been unsure whether it was also responsible for the  Justinianic Plague. At its peak, 5,000 people per day in Constantinople died from it, killing half the population. Some historians say the damage was so great to the Persian and Byzantine . empires that it made them vulnerable to the Muslim conquests of the . next century. The latest study was led by Holger C. Scholz and Michaela Harbeck of the Palaeogenetics Group at the Institute . of Anthropology at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz. 'For a long time scholars from different disciplines have intensively . discussed about the actual etiological agents of the past pandemics', . said Dr. Barbara Bramanti, who also worked on the research. 'Only ancient DNA analyses carried out on skeletal remains of plague victims could finally conclude the debate.' Dr Bramanti also headed the international team which demonstrated . beyond any doubt that Y. pestis also caused the second pandemic of the . 14th-17th centuries including the Black Death, the infamous epidemic . that ravaged Europe from 1346-1351. Researchers at the Institute of Anthropology at Johannes Gutenberg University analysed ancient DNA from the teeth of 19 different sixth-century skeletons from a medieval graveyard in Bavaria, Germany, of people who apparently succumbed to the Justinianic Plague . To help solve the mystery, scientists analysed ancient DNA from the . teeth of 19 different sixth-century skeletons from a medieval graveyard . in Bavaria, Germany, of people who apparently succumbed to the . Justinianic Plague. They say the results, published last . week in PloS Pathogens, 'Confirmed unambiguously that Y. pestis was . indeed the causing agent of the first pandemic, in contrast to what has . been postulated by other scientists recently. The researchers said these findings confirm that the Justinianic Plague crossed the Alps, killing people in what is now Bavaria.

However, they admit they still are not sure how many strain of the plague were responsible for the deaths. 'It remains questionable whether at the time of the Byzantine Emperor .

I was invited out to the Rockingham Race track by Rick Parfitt Jnr – the current British GT4 champion, rock star and all-round good guy. It had been raining all morning and it's my excuse that the wet road surface contributed to my ignominious exit of the track on the third bend. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hot wheels: Spencer geared up for life in the fast lane this week . I shot off the road and into the gravel at about 120mph and the wall was approaching fast. I wasn't too bothered about my safety - we were well strapped in and had race helmets on – I was more concerned with the fact that I had signed a waiver beforehand saying that I would pay for any damage to the car. As the crash barrier got closer and closer I got a sinking feeling deep in my stomach, and wallet.

Rick said I had the makings of a good racing driver – my commitment was total and I put the pedal to the metal at all times, I just needed some more practice. On my second time on the track I achieved an impressive first lap time and, buoyed with confidence, started to look for a better racing line.

A handful of his Facebook 'friends' also commented, wishing him luck and jokingly offering him a ride. The post got one like. Police, not believing their luck, used Facebook to lure Lescowitch to them. Posing as an attractive woman, one of the investigating officers, T.J. Rentschler, began chatting online with Lescowitch about his wanted picture. Over about 30 minutes, the 'woman' was able to gather key information about Lescowitch which led to his arrest. The undercover cop invited Lescowitch to meet for a drink. When the fugitive declined, the cop said:  'The least you can do is come out and have a cigarette with me.'

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . One of the biggest Mayan pyramids in Belize has been all but destroyed by 'ignorant' builders who ravaged the ancient structure for crushed rock to fill in a new road. The construction workers used bulldozers and diggers to claw at the sloping sides of the 100ft tall pyramid, which is part of the Nohmul complex - the most important Mayan site in northern Belize and one which dates back at least 2,300 years. Horrified archaeologists claim there is no way the builders could have mistaken the Mayan ruins for a hill, as the landscape is naturally flat and the Nohmul complex is well known. 'Obscene': A construction company used bulldozers and diggers to claw into an ancient Mayan pyramid in Belize and extract crushed rock to use as roadfill . 'Disbelief': Archaeologists in Belize said learning of the destruction of the ruin was 'like being punched in the stomach' Jaime Awe, head of the Belize Institute of Archaeology, said the . destruction at the Nohmul complex in northern Belize was detected late . last week. 'It's a feeling of Incredible disbelief because of the ignorance and the insensitivity ... they were using this for road fill,' Mr Awe said. 'It's like being punched in the stomach, it's just so horrendous.' Nohmul sat in the middle of a privately owned sugar cane field, and lacked the even stone sides frequently seen in reconstructed or better-preserved pyramids. Nonetheless Mr Awe is certain the builders could not have mistaken the pyramid mound for anything other than Mayan ruins. 'Ignorance and insensitivity': Horrified archaelogists say there is no way the construction workers could have mistaken the 100ft tall ruins for a natural hill . Historic: The ancient structure was part of the Nohmul complex in northern Belize . 'These guys knew that this was an ancient structure. It's just bloody laziness,' he said. The builders used backhoes to claw at the sides of the pyramid, leaving an isolated core of limestone cobbles at the centre, with what appears to be a narrow Mayan chamber dangling above one hollowed-out section. Fragments: Police in Belize are investigating and criminal charges may be brought against the construction firm . 'Just to realize that the ancient Maya acquired all this building material to erect these buildings, using nothing more than stone tools and quarried the stone, and carried this material on their heads, using tump lines,' said the archaeologist. 'To think that today we have modern equipment, that you can go and excavate in a quarry anywhere, but that this company would completely disregard that and completely destroyed this building. Why can't these people just go and quarry somewhere that has no cultural significance? It's mind-boggling.' Belizean police said they are . conducting an investigation and that criminal charges may be brought . against the construction company. The Nohmul complex sits on private land, but Belizean law says that any pre-Hispanic ruins are under government protection. The . Belize community-action group Citizens Organized for Liberty Through . Action called the destruction of the archaeological site 'an obscene . example of disrespect for the environment and history'. It . is not the first time it's happened in Belize, a country of about . 350,000 people that is largely covered in jungle and dotted with . hundreds of Mayan ruin sites - though few as large as Nohmul. Norman Hammond, an emeritus . professor of . archaeology at Boston University who worked in Belizean research . projects in the 1980s, said it was far from the first time Mayan mounds . had been targeted by construction workers seeking materials. He wrote in an email that 'bulldozing Maya mounds . for road fill is an endemic problem in Belize (the whole of the San . Estevan center has gone, both of the major pyramids at Louisville, other . structures at Nohmul, many smaller sites), but this sounds like the . biggest yet'. Heritage: Belize is dotted with hundreds of ruin sites dating back to the time of the ancient Mayas . Arlen Chase, chairman of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Central Florida, said: 'Archaeologists are disturbed when such things occur, but there is only a very limited infrastructure in Belize that can be applied to cultural heritage management. 'Unfortunately, they (destruction of sites) are all too common, but not usually in the center of a large Maya site,' he said. He said there had probably still been much to learn from the site. 'A great deal of archaeology was undertaken at Nohmul in the `70s and `80s, but this only sampled a small part of this large center.' Belize isn't the only place where the handiwork of the far-flung and enormously prolific Maya builders is being destroyed. Dominance: The Mayan Empire covered all of the Yucatan Peninsula and modern day Guatemala and Belize, along with parts of Mexico (pictured), Honduras and El Salvador . The ancient Mayas spread across southeastern Mexico and through Guatemala, Honduras and Belize. 'I . don't think I am exaggerating if I say that every day a Maya mound is . being destroyed for construction in one of the countries where the Maya . lived,' wrote Francisco Estrada-Belli, a professor at Tulane . University's Anthropology Department. 'Unfortunately, this destruction of our heritage is irreversible but many don't take it seriously,' he added. 'The only way to stop it is by showing that it is a major crime and people can and will go to jail for it.' Robert Rosenswig, an archaeologist at the State University of New York at Albany, described the difficult and heartbreaking work of trying to salvage information at the nearby site of San Estevan following similar destruction around 2005. 'Bulldozing damage at San Estevan is extensive and the site is littered with Classic period potsherds,' he wrote in an academic paper describing the scene. 'We spent a number of days at the beginning of the 2005 season trying to figure out the extent of the damage .... after scratching our heads for many days, a bulldozer showed up and we realized that what appear to be mounds, when overgrown with chest-high vegetation, are actually recently bulldozed garbage piles.' However small the compensation, bulldozing pyramids is one very brutal way of revealing the inner cores of the structures, which were often built up in periodic stages of construction. ""The one advantage of this massive destruction, to the core site, is that the remains of early domestic activity are now visible on the surface,' Mr Rosenswig wrote. Belize, which shares its rich Mayan heritage with neighbouring Guatemala, Mexico and Honduras, is regarded as the heart of the civilisation during the Classic period of 250AD to 900AD. It was during this period - the golden age of the empire - that the Maya built the great stone cities and monuments that have captured the imagination of explorers and scholars for centuries. Classic Maya civilisation grew to some 40 cities, and it is thought that the population may have grown to reach two million people at its peak. Archaeologists excavating Maya sites have uncovered plazas and temples, palaces and pyramids. The heart of Classic Maya: A Mayan temple in Xunantunich, in the Cayo district of western Belize . Many Classic Maya temples and palaces were constructed in a stepped pyramid shape, and engraved with elaborate artworks and inscriptions. The Maya placed temple-pyramids at the heart of their great stone cities. One of the best known - the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque in Mexico - was a monument to the 7th Century king Hanab Pakal. Another famous Maya structure is the Pyramid of the Magician at Uxmal, Mexico. According to Maya legend, the pyramid was built by Itzamna, god of magic, as a training centre for shamans and healers. Maya structures give clues to the importance the civilisation placed on its complex astronomical and cosmological system, with many pyramids deliberately angled to face sunrise or sunset at particular times of the year.","Construction workers ravaged 100ft pyramid for rock to use as road fill .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . Paul Ciancia, 23, moved to LA in 2012 from his native New Jersey . Federal agents are investigating the possibility that the alleged Los Angeles airport gunman believed in a conspiracy theory about a global takeover by the government. The FBI were given a warrant on Monday to search Paul Ciancia's cell phone for materials reflecting his 'views on the legitimacy or activities of the United States government, including the existence of a plot to impose a New World Order,' according to court documents. Ciancia, a 23-year-old unemployed motorcycle mechanic, got a ride to LAX on Friday morning, walked inside and began targeting Transportation Security Administration officers, authorities said. By the time LAX police officers subdued him with several gunshots, one TSA officer, Gerardo I. Hernandez, had been killed and two others were injured. A note found in a bag after the shooting mentioned the 'NWO,' an apparent reference to the new world order belief that holds an international cabal of elites is planning to take away the guns and personal freedoms of Americans, authorities said. Perceived masterminds behind the conspiracy have shifted over several generations, among them bankers, communists and the government itself. Why airport security officers apparently came to personify oppression for the gunman remains unclear. A motive? They are investigating his ties to the belief in the New World Order - that a totalitarian regime will take away weapons and freedoms. Pictured, Los Angeles airport after the shooting . The TSA does not regularly feature as a target of the theory's ire, according to Mark Potok, who has studied extremist groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center. More typically, believers focus on another homeland security agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which according to the theory plans to build camps to detain resisters to the new order, Potok said. Potok said he has seen no evidence that Ciancia was personally involved in hate groups. The rant in his note also spoke of how . TSA searches were a violation of constitutional rights and a vulgar . term was used to refer to Janet Napolitano, the former secretary of the . Department of Homeland Security, which oversees TSA. Conspiracy: A long note found in Ciancini's bag mentioned the New World Order, authorities have said . Ciancia's family, from Pennsville, New Jersey, have offered sympathy to the family of the victim. In a statement, they also expressed their shock at the rampage and hope for the recovery of the surviving victims. One of those officers, Tony Grigsby, spoke for the first time publicly, saying he was trying to help an elderly man get to safety when the gunman shot him in the right foot. He hobbled with a cane outside his South Los Angeles home, where he fought back tears recalling Hernandez as a wonderful person who will be missed. 'Only now it has hit me that I will never see him again,' Grigsby said. Co-workers, friends and others gathered Monday night for a tribute to Hernandez at a beach near the airport. Victim: TSA screener Gerardo I. Hernandez, pictured, was killed in the shooting and two others were hurt . Remembered: TSA officer Alexa Mendoza lights a candle at a memorial to the TSA officers who were killed and wounded at Terminal 3 at Los Angeles International Airport on Monday . 'He was loved,' Jose Araujo, one of hundreds of people who gathered at Dockweiler State Beach, told KNBC-TV. 'He's going to be missed and he's never going to be forgotten.' The other wounded TSA officer has been released from the hospital, the agency said, and the condition of high school teacher Brian Ludmer, who was shot in the calf, was upgraded from fair to good. Ciancia remained in critical condition and any court appearance on charges of first-degree murder of a federal officer and committing violence at an international airport will depend on when his doctors say he's ready, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.","FBI granted warrant to search Paul Ciancia's phone for material 'reflecting his views that the government was trying to impose totalitarian regime'

Shock: Above, the scene where the firefighters were injured Thursday morning . Captain Grider and Quinn were taken to the University of Louisville hospital where Grider, an 11-year veteran, was last reported in critical condition. This afternoon, Quinn's condition was upgraded from serious to fair. The incident happened this morning as the Campbellsville firefighters were helping the local university's marching band perform an ALS ice bucket challenge. The ice bucket challenge has been sweeping social media, with those taking part pouring a bucket of ice-cold water over their heads to raise awareness for amypthropic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The Campbellsville University marching band decided to take the challenge in a unique way, by having the local fire department soak them from above with their fire hose. Pictures of the marching band being sprayed by Grider and Quinn have already been posted on Twitter. It was only after the challenge, while Grider and Quinn were packing up the ladder, that a surge of energy struck the ladder. Dangerous: Police Chief Tim Hazlette said at a Thursday afternoon press conference that it appears the ladder never even touched live power lines, but that the electricity 'arched over' At an afternoon press conference on Thursday, authorities said the power lines may have never even touched the ladder. 'It appears energy arched over and the ladder didn't actually hit the lines. If you get within a certain radius that can happen,' Police Chief Tim Hazlette said. The shock electrocuted Quinn and Grider as well as fellow firefighters Steve Marrs, 37, and Alex Johnson, 28. Marrs, an 11-year veteran of the force, and Johnson were taken to Taylor Regional Hospital where they were treated and released. The incident caused power to go down in the community for several hours, but it has since been restored. No students were injured. 'A number of our students, of course, the entire marching band, witnessed the event and so we're concerned about them and the tragedy of this accident,' Campbellsville University President Dr Michael Carter said. Tonight, a prayer vigil was scheduled for 7pm on the Campbellsville campus. The university has also released a statement expressing their condolences to the injured firefighters.

I didn't make anyone stay here until 7 a.m. or 11 a.m.' ‘We had people calling 911 from the party saying people are freaking out or overdosing or falling down,’ Casey Nemeth, deputy sergeant with Mecosta County Sheriff's Office, told WZZM13. ‘And they couldn't even get an ambulance down the road.’ Deputies said they originally responded to calls that cars were illegally parked, but once on scene they witnessed multiple accounts of underage drinking and drug use with some party-goers as young as 14-years-old. EMS transported at least seven people to the hospital: six people for possible drug and alcohol overdoses, then one man who fell off the barn while intoxicated, who was in serious condition. Authorities are also investigating an alleged sexual assault of a 19-year-old woman. Taylor told reporters afterwards that he was thankful the police came to break-up the rave. Six people were taken to hospital for possible drug and alcohol overdoses . The floors shook: The party was so crowded people couldn't pass by one another and the floors of James Taylor's farmhouse trembled . 'People could have been lying out in my yard dead this morning,’ he told Fox. 'I’m glad the police were here and the ambulances.' Taylor said that while he takes responsibility for throwing the party, he doesn’t think it is his fault that people overdosed. 'I didn’t force anything down anyone’s throat. I didn’t make anyone stay here until 7 a.m. or 11 a.m. or whenever it is that everyone finally left. I didn’t make this kid pass out on my floor. People wanted to be here. That was their decision,' he said. Taylor also said that he didn't know there were minors at his party but that those children's parents should be blamed over him. 'If you are a parent that’s got a 14-year-old child that’s been able to be at my house all night, and according to the police there was a lot of them here. So, I think some parents should do some reflections on their parenting before they start getting mad at me.' Taylor protests that he even offered all of his 2,000 guests the option of crashing at his home so none of them had to drive home drunk. When asked if he plans to have another party on the property, Taylor joked, 'there's always a coming home party.'

"By . James Nye for MailOnline . The family of a missing New Jersey student last seen hiking outside Jerusalem called on the Israeli Defense Force to join the search on Monday, amid fears he could have been the victim of ongoing tensions with Palestinians. Aaron Sofer, 23, failed to return home on Friday after becoming separated from a friend on a wooded slope in the Jerusalem Forest, near to where a Palestinian boy was found burned last month in a revenge attack for the murder of three Israeli students in June. His parents, who have flown to Israel, believe he could have been the victim of a reprisal attack and have openly questioned authorities attempts to locate their son, especially in light of the current Gaza-Israeli conflict. Scroll down for video . Disappeared: Twenty-three-year-old yeshiva student Aaron Sofer has been missing since Friday when he went on a hike with a friend in the Jerusalem Forest . 'A physically, mentally and emotionally healthy young man does not go missing for 72 hours,' Dov Hirth, a spokesman for the family told the Jerusalem Post on Monday. 'The family is not satisfied with the way the search and rescue operation has been handled thus far.' Hundreds of officers and volunteers joined the search for Sofer since the alarm was first raised on Friday after he split from his friend while they were climbing in the Beit Zayit area of the Jerusalem Woods. 'The fact of the matter is we have a young man missing for no apparent reason, and it was on page 1 of all the newspapers and then the coverage just stopped,' said Hirth to the Jerusalem Post. 'This needs to continue to be a major story.' Aaron Sofer, 23, disappeared on Friday while hiking in the Jerusalem Forest with a friend who reported him missing . Last month, three Israeli's were indicted for the sickening murder of Muhammad Abu Khdeir, 16, whose burnt body was found near to where Sofer disappeared. 'This area is bordered by Jewish communities and by Arab communities, so it is very concerning,' said Meir Lichtenstein who is a member of the Lakewood Council in New Jersey, the Sofer's home town. Indeed, concern is rising amongst the Jewish community back in the United States. 'It’s scary to think what possibly could be the ramifications,' said neighbor Tzvi Meth to CBS Local. 'Great fear is that he was accosted; he was taken away, kidnapped.'","Aaron Sofer, 23, has not been seen since going hiking outside Jerusalem on Friday .

Koppenhaver is currently on the run from the police and Chapman has warned him that he too is on his case. On the hunt: Duane Chapman, aka Dog the Bounty Hunter, is after MMA fighter Jon Koppenhaver . Angry: Chapman (left) tweeted Koppenhaver after he allegedly beat up his ex-girlfriend Christy Mack . The 61-year-old tweeted directly to Koppenhaver issuing an ultimatum to the fugitive that he had 24 hours before he personally would begin his search to track him down. '.@WarMachine170 better 2Give All You Excuses To The Judge ..you got 24 hrs to turn your self in or I am Coming After YOU.!#CMTDogAndBeth,' was Chapman's first message. He later tweeted: '#CMTDogAndBeth War Machine YOU HAVE 6 HOURS LEFT !!SEE YOU SOON !!' as the countdown got closer before he finished with '#CMTDogAndBeth @WarMachine170 Time is up ! BEWARE OF THE DOG...' as the 24 hours elapsed. Mack was allegedly beaten at the hands of her ex-boyfriend at their Las Vegas home. She is in hospital and Koppenhaver, known in the ring as War Machine, is wanted by police. Porn star Christy Mack released these horrific images of her injuries from the hospital, claiming they were sustained when she was assaulted by former boyfriend and MMA fighter Jon Koppenhaver . Mack said that not only did Koppenhaver beat her, but that he also attacked her with a knife stabbing her repeatedly before the blade broke off . 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning, Jon . Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he . broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego,' Mack wrote on Twitter. 'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed . in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; . once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention . to me. 'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me . out and beat my face. I  have . no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries . that resulted from my beating. My injuries include 18 broken bones . around my eyes, my nose is broken in 2 places, I am missing teeth and . several more are broken.' Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth. She also said she could not walk on her own, and had a fractured rib and ruptured liver from a kick to her side. 'I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen,' she wrote. 'He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife. Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife . Mack said that Koppenhaver had long been abusive in their relationship but that this beating had made her fear for her life . 'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts. He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard. After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.' Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife. 'I ran out my back door, shutting it . behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the . fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house. Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the . neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought . to the hospital and treated for my injuries.' Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she tolerated beatings and infidelity in the past. Tainted love: Christy Mack (left) is in hospital and War Machine, aka Jon Koppenhaver, is at large after he allegedly beat her brutally at their Las Vegas home . 'After many months of fear and pressure to keep this man happy, although I fear for my life, I feel that I can no longer put myself in this situation,' she wrote. She added that there was a $10,000 reward for his capture. Police have yet to identify the third party who was in Mack's home and assaulted. confirming only that both Mack and the third party sustained 'severe but non-life-threatening injures.' Koppenhaver has not come forward but he has tweeted about the incident. '@ChristyMack I love you and hope you're okay. I came him (sic) early to surprise you and help you set up for your convention. I can't believe what I found and can't believe what happened. 'I'm so heart broken...in all ways. I will always love you.' TMZ reports that Mack is 'in very bad shape' after the attack and can barely speak from her injuries. A representative for the porn actress told TMZ that Mack's friends and relatives are offering a $5,000 reward to anyone who can provide clues as to Koppenhaver's whereabouts. Koppenhaver has also taken to Twitter about the incident, writing that he wanted to surprise Mack with an engagement ring but couldn't 'believe what I found.' 'I'm not a bad guy, I went to surprise my gf, help her set up her show . and to give her an engagement ring and ended up fighting for my life,' he added. Then: ""The cops will never give me fair play, never believe . me. Still deciding what to do but at the end of the day it's all just . heart breaking."" 'I only wish that man hadn't been there and that Christy & I would . be happily engaged.I don't know y I'm so cursed.One day truth will come out.' Welterweight Koppenhaver, who appears on the FOX show Ultimate Fighter, has been released from his contract with MMA tournament group Bellator. Big man: Koppenhaver has spent time in jail for assault, and Mack has previously spoken about his physical violence towards her . Porn star: The tattooed brunette works in the porn industry but is currently in hospital with injuries so severe that she has difficulty speaking . Selfie-obsessed: 'War Machine' tweeted about the attack, hinting that he had found Mack en flagrante with another person . Bellator's president told TMZ that Koppenhaver would not be welcome back. 'We have a zero tolerance policy here at Bellator when it relates to any form of domestic violence, and after learning of this latest incident involving (Jon Koppenhaver) War Machine, Bellator is releasing him from his promotional contract with the organization,' Bellator president Scott Coker told TMZ. Koppenhaver served a year in jail in 2012 for an assault in a San Diego nightclub. Fox Sports reports that last November she wrote that Koppenhaver 'threatened to kill' her. She deleted the tweets not long after and Koppenhaver tweeted that she had been joking. Later, she tweeted that she had endured 'several slapping, choking unconscious, smothering, kicking and throwings' at his hands.","GRAPHIC PHOTOS .

Chief Surgeon: Geoff Chapman, 67, whose grandfather started the hospital in 1913, now continues the traditional family business  with the help of up to 12 other staff . Before and after: This composition doll, made from compressed wood chip, had its hair, eyes and lips hand-painted by Australian doll repairer Kerry Stuart whose hands can be seen using folded sandpaper to gently file the cheek (left) 'We're one of the last ones that does everything, when it comes to dolls, there's very few that are capable of that sort of work,' Mr Chapman told Reuters. 'We've had customers who've burst into tears when they saw their treasured doll or teddy as good as new.' The hospital was first set up by Harold Chapman Senior when a shipping mishap led the rubber bands holding together some celluloid dolls from Japan tear, forcing Harold to find a way to repair them. The business blossomed from there, booming during World War Two when restrictions on manufactured and imported goods meant new dolls were not easy to come by, forcing children to repair what they had rather than buy anew.

At this point, the hospital had 70 staff members working across six workrooms. Now however, Mr Chapman says the majority of the hospital's work comes from older customers hoping to restore their childhood memories in order to pass them on to younger generations. 'I would say about 80 per cent of our work comes from 'big children,' he said. 'When they were children they possibly only got one doll, not a new doll every time you go down the supermarket like it happens today. That's why it's so emotional.

'It's both men and women, obviously more women are getting dolls and teddies repaired, but there's quite a few men attached to teddy bears too.' Kerry Stuart, who has worked at the hospital for more than 25 years compared her work to surgery, especially when it comes to dolls made from delicate materials. 'A lot of our tools are like surgeons', operating on human patients,' she said. 'The thing I like least is eyes. It's a very difficult balancing act to get them right, so it does take a while. Sometimes I have to do them three times before I'm happy with them,' she said. But with today's  consumerist culture, the hospital is seeing less and less patients turn up at their doors.

"By . Marc Weinreich . Two Texas teachers are building a home made of Styrofoam that's as sturdy as bricks and could withstand the huffs and puffs of a Big Bad Wolf. According to Shannon and Lesa Cockrell of Hudson, Texas, their 1,400-square-foot house could survive winds of 200 mph. The entire project will cost less than $100,000 to build. A similar wood-frame house would cost $150,000, they estimate. 'We decided this is something we want to do,' Shannon Cockrell told KTRE-TV. 'To one: help our environment, and two: to make it economically possible for all of us to afford housing. It's safer, it's more secure [and] you get better energy efficiency.' Scroll down for video . DIY: High school teachers Shannon and Lesa Cockrell are trendsetters by building their home out of Styrofoam instead of brick . Just like LEGOs: The blocks are assembled the same way one would imagine building with LEGOs; teeth from the top of the block slide into slits at the bottom of another block . Mr Cockrell and his wife, Lesa, are teachers at a high school in town, but Mr Cockrell believes that despite careers that may not be ideal for a Do-It-Yourself home building project, they are still confident that they can build the walls in virtually no time. 'My wife and I are not contractors and we are not home builders at all and we can have these walls built in about a week, week and a half,' he said. The home, of course, isn't made entirely of styrofoam. Concrete is poured into the hollow styrofoam blocks and becomes the actual structure of the house. The outside of the blocks are coated with stuccos, waterproofing finishes, drywall or siding. The Cockrells plan to add a stone finish. Before the styrofoam sandwich is made, however, the hollow blocks are stacked on top of each other like LEGOs - teeth from the top of the block slide into slits at the bottom of another block. The Texas couple is working with Utah-based SmartBlocks, a supplier of styrofoam blocks for residential and commercial properties. Cost-effective: The Cockrells plan on building the 1,400-square-foot house for less than $100,000 and hope to finish in November . The Cockrells said the fact that SmartBlocks is owned by disabled American veterans is another reason they sourced from them. The Cockrells may be on to something, too. The Styrofoam is becoming an ever-more popular building material, Mike Trolle, a member of the Connecticut Green Building Council, told The Stamford Advocate earlier this year. Insulated concrete foam -- ICF -- has been around for decades, but it's still a phenomenon in the residential space, he said. One drawback, however, is the loss of space to the numerous layers of wall that go into supporting, decorating and protecting the styrofoam, according to architecture blog Architangent, which explored the 'hidden costs' of ICF. Hard to tell: This otherwise nondescript home in Idaho was built with the same Styrofoam system used by the Cockrells . 'The disadvantage of this type of construction is the overall wall thickness; ICF walls tend to be very thick, and total wall assemblies (the structure plus interior finish and exterior cladding) can be upwards of 14 inches thick,' according to the blog. 'It is easy to see that choosing ICF means giving up some interior space to the wall.' The Cockrells said they hope to open their doors in late November. 'My wife and I, both of us teach, and we're always telling our kids do something different, make a difference in something,"" Mr. Cockrell told KTRE.","Shannon and Lesa Cockrell of Hudson, Texas say their 1,400-square-foot-home will cost less than $100,000 .

"By . Reuters . Burger King is . in talks to combine with Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc in a deal that would create a fast food . powerhouse with a market capitalization of roughly $18 billion. The companies confirmed merger discussions late on Sunday, . and said the new company would be the world's third-largest . quick service restaurant. It would be based in Canada, which has . lower overall corporate taxes than the United States. Burger King is in talks to combine with Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc in a deal that would create a fast food powerhouse with a market capitalization of roughly $18 billion . The proposed deal would be structured as a so-called tax . inversion transaction to move Burger King's domicile out of the . United States, and could come as soon as in the next few days, . according to sources familiar with the discussions. Recent attempts by companies for tax inversion deals, which . are made to avoid higher U.S. taxes and save money on foreign earnings and cash held outside the United States, have drawn the . attention of President Barack Obama, who criticized a 'herd . mentality' by companies seeking such deals. Walgreen Co recently decided against a tax inversion . deal in its acquisition of European pharmacy chain Alliance . Boots, saying it was 'not in the best long-term . interest of shareholders to attempt to re-domicile outside the . U.S.' Amid heightened political sensitivity in the United States . to such tax-cutting transactions, Walgreen said it was mindful . of the public reaction to a potential inversion deal and its . role as an 'iconic American consumer retail company with a major . portion of its revenues derived from government-funded . reimbursement programs.' The companies said 3G Capital, the majority owner of Burger . King, will continue to own the majority of the shares in the new . combined entity on a pro forma basis, with the remainder held by . existing shareholders of Tim Hortons and Burger King. 3G, a New York-based investment firm with Brazilian roots, . acquired the then struggling Burger King in 2010 for about $3.3 . billion. The proposed deal would be structured as a so-called tax inversion transaction to move Burger King's domicile out of the United States, and could come as soon as in the next few days, according to sources familiar with the discussions . It later took the company back to market in 2012 but . still owns nearly 70 per cent of the firm's shares, according to . Thomson Reuters data. Tim Hortons and Burger King are set to operate as standalone . brands within this new entity while benefiting from shared . corporate services, the companies said. Burger King said its experience in building a large global . footprint would allow it to help accelerate Tim Hortons's growth . in international markets. If a deal gets sealed this wouldn't be the first time the . iconic Canadian restaurant chain moves into foreign hands. It . was bought by Wendy's International Inc in 1995, but later spun . out in 2006 after the fast food chain came under pressure from . activist investor Nelson Peltz. While operated from Oakville, Ontario, it kept its corporate . headquarters in Delaware before moving it back to Canada in . 2009. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper took some credit . for the move, citing the Conservative government's decision to . cut the corporate tax rate. Tim Hortons and Burger King are set to operate as standalone brands within this new entity while benefiting from shared corporate services, the companies said . Since coming to power in 2006, the Conservatives have cut . Canada's corporate tax rate to 15 per cent. Public companies also . have to pay provincial corporate taxes that then bring their . combined federal and provincial tax rate to about 25 per cent or . higher. Tim Hortons and Burger King said they do not plan to comment . on this potential deal further unless and until a transaction is . agreed, or discussions are discontinued.

Ben Eberle's iPod Touch - which includes an application that is specifically wired to let him use his prosthetic hand, San Antonio Express-News reported. '[Getting a new prosthetic hand and iPod configured to work together] takes a long time,' Eberle told the newspaper. 'It's tedious and it's a lot of work with the hand itself.' Veteran: U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Ben Eberle is seen in this 2011 file photo. Eberle lost his right hand and both of his legs because of a bomb explosion . Speaking about the robbery, Eberele also said 'I was pissed. I threw my blanket off and I wanted to just get up and run out the door, but I had to get my wheelchair.' The Eberles told the newspaper that the thief unsuccessfully attempted to yank the soldier's stereo. Three years ago, Eberle lost both his right hand and both of his legs in Afghanistan because of a bomb explosion, the newspaper reported. 'They didn't know if I was going to make it,' he told San Antonio Express-News. Missing: Police said the missing iPod Touch would have a case not unlike this one . Hand: The San Antonio Police Department shared this photograph on Facebook of Eberle's prosthetic hand . 'I believe that we owe guys like this a lot more than this sort of treatment, as a society,' San Antonio Police Department spokesman Sgt. Javier Salazar told San Antonio Express-News. 'We would ask that whoever did this recognize the gravity of their crime and do the right thing.' Eberle maintained in a Facebook post the Veterans Administration is able to cover a replacement hand and that he and his wife 'don't need help getting anything.' 'I can turn in my hand to the VA like I told them and do a 1 for 1 swap,' he wrote. 'I'm just pissed that someone smashed my window open, that's all. They just wanted another story about a wounded warrior.' On Facebook, the police department wrote that 'Crimestoppers could pay up to $5000 for information.'

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . An orphaned baby aardvark which was less than three months old when its mother was shot by a farmer has found a loving home at a nature reserve. Little Barkie was found confused and frightened near the N/a'an ku sê Wildlife Sanctuary in Namibia, where his near-hairless body was at risk from the African winter nights. Staff at the reserve near the capital Windhoek now take him out for daily walks to accustom him to his environment - and even have a special pair of 'pyjamas' to keep him warm. Just lazing around: Barkie with a staff member at the sanctuary after being rehabilitated to his environment . Ant no sunshine when she's gone: Little Barkie the aardvark lost his mother when he was three months old . Saved: Barkie is now taken for daily walks by staff at the N/a'an ku sê sanctuary near Windhoek, Namibia . Aardvarks are common in large parts of Africa but they come into conflict with farmers, because they often dig holes through which livestock can escape into predators' jaws. When female aardvarks are shot their young are left vulnerable, because they usually remain by their mother's side for the first six months of their lives. Staff said Barkie is now recovering well on a healthy foraged diet of termites and other insects. A spokesperson for the sanctuary said: 'The killing of aardvarks is tragically a common occurrence in Nambia, where farmers and landowners heavily depend on their livestock to eke a living out of this desert land. 'The natural burrowing and digging behaviour of aardvark inadvertently causes holes in fences that allow the livestock to escape, making them vulnerable to free-roaming carnivores. A spokesman for the sanctuary said: 'The behaviour of these elusive creatures has remained undiscovered, but with Barkie's help we hope to erase their misunderstood reputation of these magnificent mammals' Every cloud: Aardvarks, with huge ears, noses and tongues, normally remain with their mothers for six months . Unusual: The name aardvark means 'ant pig' in Afrikaans, the language of South Africa's original Dutch settlers . 'Sadly aardvarks have gained an increasingly negative reputation which is wholly misunderstood. Barkie's mother suffered this fate but her helpless baby was thankfully taken pity on. 'The bush walks give Barkie the chance to fully embrace his natural instincts. 'We carefully consider the natural needs of every orphan tending away from the feeling of captivity. Instead we create an environment where their instinctive behaviours are nurtured and encouraged. 'The behaviour of these elusive creatures has remained largely undiscovered, but with Barkie's help we hope to erase the misunderstood reputation of these magnificent mammals.' Unpopular: Barkie's mother was shot by a farmer. Many hate aardvarks for burrowing tunnels under their land . A similar species to anteaters in the U.S., aardvarks live across Africa south of the Sahara desert. Their name literally means 'earth pig' in Afrikaans, the language of the original Dutch settlers in South Africa, but their bodies appear to fuse together elements from rabbits and even kangaroos. With bodies measuring more than 4ft long, the termite-eating animals have to be prodigious diggers to break into ant mounts. As well as long tongues to scoop out the unlucky termites, they have claws which resemble small spades to break open earthen anthills which have been hardened like brick by the sun. Those claws also help dig the burrows in which they live and where they sleep during the day, particularly in summer when the hot African sun makes it difficult to forage for food.

The body of an 18-year-old freshman at Penn State was found on Sunday morning after he fell or jumped from a construction site crane on the college campus, the weekend before he was set to begin classes. Jack Crean's body was discovered on the pavement of the Hetzel Union Building-Robeson Center renovation project on the school's campus in State College, Pennsylvania, after a fall of roughly 85 feet.

'It's a sorrowful start to the academic year and our hearts go out to Jack’s family and friends,' University spokeswoman Lisa Powers said. Toxicology reports are not expected for four to six weeks, but there is currently no evidence that Crean was intoxicated when this tragedy occurred. Crean was due to begin his first classes today along with thousands of other incoming first-year students. Penn State's main campus has about 45,000 students, of whom about 35,000 are undergraduates. 'He was as loyal of a friend as you can find and all he ever wanted when he was with us was for us to be laughing and enjoying ourselves,' Penn State freshman Mitchell Walker, of State College, told the Centre Daily Times. 'He will be forever missed and never forgotten. I love that kid like a brother.' The college freshman also excelled at business, this according to Sam Schwab, who graduated from State High, also located in State College, Pennsylvania, with Crean in 2014. 'Jack was always a good friend and had so much potential,' he said. 'Any time I had a question about something to do with business I would go to him. Everyone loved him because he was so outgoing and bright.' Crean had just moved into a dormitory on the campus, according to Pleskonko.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . Captain Ben Babington-Browne was said to be a 'rising star' within the British army . A helicopter which crashed on take-off in Afghanistan, killing a British soldier and two Canadian troops, was not suitable for the mission, an inquest has heard. Captain Ben Babington-Browne, 27, was a passenger on the Canadian Griffon CH-146, which was being used as a 'taxi' from forward operating base (FOB) Mescal. The inquest was told that as the aircraft, carrying six people, tried to take off on July 6 2009, a dust bowl was whipped up by the rotor blades, cutting visibility. At a height of less than 10ft, the helicopter then drifted and its rotors collided with a perimeter fence in a corner of the FOB before it crashed and burst into flames. Capt Babington-Browne, from 22 Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers, had been strapped in but seated on the floor of the aircraft on take-off, with his legs dangling out. Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander William Robley, of the UK Defence Helicopter Flying School, told the inquest that Capt Babington-Browne, of Maidstone, Kent, became trapped. At County Hall, Maidstone, Lt Cdr Robley agreed that the weight of the aircraft, the altitude and the temperature meant it was not the correct helicopter for that mission. Deputy coroner for Maidstone and Medway Andrew Campbell-Tiech QC asked: 'Would you expect a competent pilot to have understood that this was not the correct helicopter for the mission?' Lt Cdr Robley said it boiled down to the pilot's training, adding: 'Unless they have been trained, they are on a voyage of discovery.' The coroner added: 'Had you been there, would it have been obvious to you of the risks attached to using the Griffon helicopter in these conditions?' Lt Cdr Robley replied: 'Yes.' He said he was not aware from the Canadians of any difficulties they had operating the helicopter in the hostile environment. The inquest heard that the heavy weight of the aircraft was partly due to the large amount of fuel it was carrying. Dr Michael Powers, counsel for the family of Capt Babington-Browne, suggested there was a conflict between a desire to have an adequate reserve of fuel and to fly within safe limits. A Canadian Griffon C-146, like the one which crashed in 2009, in flight over Afghanistan's Kandahar province . Hearing the evidence was Capt Babington-Browne's brother Daniel and mother Nina, who withdrew from the hearing at one point as details of her son's death were disclosed. Following Capt Babington-Browne's death, he was described by his senior officers as a 'rising star' who had 'the world at his feet'. A graphic designer before joining the Army, Capt Babington-Browne completed his officer's training at Sandhurst. He became a member of 22 Engineer Regiment in April 2007 and shortly afterwards deployed to Iraq, where he quickly distinguished himself as an 'exceptionally gifted leader'. He volunteered for a six-month tour of Afghanistan, working in the headquarters of Nato's Regional Command (South) in Kandahar.","Captain Ben Babington-Browne was killed in helicopter crash in Afghanistan .

Banknotes bearing a 'Free Palestine! Boycott Israel!!!' stamp have surfaced in Bolton, Greater Manchester, sparking anger among locals. The Bank of England says it is illegal to deface currency - but the notes remain legal tender. But one . grandfather, who has been given one of the notes from a shop in Daubhill, was not happy to be handed the defaced £5. The 67-year-old, who would only identify himself as Bill, . said he . received the note on Sunday, August 17, after he picked up his paper. The offending £5 bank note, with the pro-Palestine message stamped on it . He did not see the message at first because the . note was folded up as it was given to him, but when he noticed it later . he became annoyed. He says he found out it came from the shop after speaking to two other residents in the area who received similar notes. The . production worker said: 'I paid with a £10 note and received the fiver . back folded in half, so I didn't realise the stamp at first. But when I . took it home there it was plain as day. 'I . was livid. It is defacing the Queen's currency. If I wrote ""free . England, boycott so and so"" on our notes I'd be in the police station . quicker than I could think. 'It's . a political statement on our currency which is out of order. It is . premeditated, not just written out of temper. I think whoever is . responsible should be taken to task about it.' The manager of the Willows Lane, Bolton, shop said he wanted to get his political message across to his customers. The shop boss, who wanted only to be known as Abdul, said: 'It's simply based on what is currently going on at the moment to make people aware about what cause they need to be supporting. 'What Israel is doing is wrong, and we need to boycott them and support Palestine. Putting a little stamp on the notes is our way of raising awareness and getting the message across using a political message. 'Some people have come in and asked what it's about, and some have realised that it is a good thing. Others don't understand it, but there hasn't been too much negativity.' A shop customer pictured with one of the stamped bank notes which have angered locals . The Bank of England - which issues the country's bank notes - confirmed it was illegal to deface currency - but stressed they were still legal tender even if they had been stamped. A spokesman for the Bank of England said: 'Defacing bank notes is definitely not something we would recommend but whether or not there would be a prosecution would be up to the Crown Prosecution Service to determine if it was in the public interest. 'We would advise people not to do it because one of the really important things is maintaining confidence in our currency and people being able to spot counterfeit money. 'The notes are legal tender but they would probably be taken out of circulation when they entered our processing plants.'","British £5 banknotes marked with message: 'Free Palestine! Boycott Israel!'

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell is on trial accused of murdering and sexually assaulting a baby for about 15 hours in March last year, including inflicting third-degree burns and bruises . A Perth court has heard Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell sat in a hot car, drinking beer and listening to music while the injured 10-month-old baby lay on the floor. The 27-year-old man faces charges of murdering and sexually assaulting a baby boy for 15 hours in March last year, but Mr Bell claims it was when he took the child into the Fortescue River to cool off that the 10-month-old drowned. He told the Perth court the he 'never would have harmed' the child because he 'was looking after him'. Mr Bell is also accused of inflicting third-degree burns and bruises on the baby but the accused maintained his innocence and said the baby's injuries were caused from falling naked from the moving car after the passenger door opened while driving through a roundabout in Broome. Mr Bell, who knew the child's mother, said he panicked and was upset seeing the child covered in dirt. 'I was crying because he had fallen out of the car,' Bell testified. He told the court the boy had grazing and bruises on his head so he cradled him against his chest, but did not take the 10-month-old baby to a hospital. 'He wasn't moving when I picked him up ... he was sobbing and crying,' Bell said. 'I was in a hysterical state of mind at the time he fell out of the car. 'To me he didn't seem to need any help.' Mr Bell told the court he drank beer and listened to music, moments before the baby drowned. He said the child was left on the floor of the hot car, and Mr Bell bought cigarettes, flavoured milk and oranges. While at a swimming spot, Mr Bell said he went under water for 20 seconds and then felt a kick to his leg, and when he came up, he found the baby head-first in the water. While testifying, Mr Bell admitted to West Australian Supreme Court he drank and listened to music while the baby lay on the floor of his hot car . Water came out of the child's mouth and Mr Bell, who was in shock, performed CPR before driving to a road-house. 'It was like he was choking,' Bell said.'I pumped on his chest a couple of times.' 'He just wouldn't breathe.' 'It just happened so fast,' he repeatedly said. 'It's a very sad incident what happened, but just got to deal with it,' Bell said. On Thursday, Mr Bell told the court he did not think the mother took care of her baby and admitted the pair argued the evening before the baby died. He said the altercation began when the woman humiliated and slapped him. 'I may have assaulted her. I'm not 100 per cent sure,' he said. Mr Bell said he tore off her clothes but denies trying to run her over in his car. 'I wanted to humiliate her,' he testified. The judge-alone trial is expected to resume on Tuesday, when the defence will be concluding its evidence.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . A football player has died of a head injury after being hit by a rock apparently thrown by his own fans at a top-flight league game in Algeria. A police investigation has been opened into the death of Albert Ebosse, a striker from Cameroon who died in hospital on Saturday night after succumbing to a head injury. He was hit by the rock as players left the field following a 2-1 loss for his club, JS Kabylie. Ebosse had scored his side's equalizer from a penalty in Saturday's game before they went on to lose 2-1 at home to USM Alger in the northern city of Tizi Ouzou. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Cameroonian striker Albert Ebosse died after being hit in the head by object thrown from stands . The 24-year-old Ebosse, the leading goal-scorer in the Algerian league last season, was apparently hit by the rock hurled from a section of JS Kabylie supporters angry at their team's loss. Ebosse was struck as players walked off after the game and fans began throwing rocks at them. He was taken to the hospital around 500 meters away from the stadium, where he died. 'We expect exemplary sanctions to be taken against this grave act of violence,' Issa Hayatou, the president of the African confederation, said in a statement. Algeria's interior ministry ordered that a police investigation be opened into Ebosse's death, JS Kabylie said in a statement on the club's website. Ebosse 'succumbed to a head injury,' JS Kabylie said. There were no immediate reports of any other players being hurt. The president of Algeria's professional league said he was present at the game but left minutes before the incident. 'I am still finding this tragic death hard to grasp because I was at the stadium just minutes before this tragic incident and Albert Ebosse was still running in all senses of the word before my eyes,' Mahfoud Kerbadj said.

The Algeria Football Federation and the professional league both ordered emergency meetings over Ebosse's death. Officials from JS Kabylie and the match officials were summoned to a special meeting on Monday, league president Kerbadj said, and the stadium where the incident took place was closed until further notice. Algeria Football Federation President Mohamed Raouraoua said he hoped that 'the perpetrators of this unspeakable act are severely punished.' Ebosse joined Kabylie last year and became an immediate success, scoring 17 goals last season as his team finished second to USM Alger, the opponents on Sunday, in Algeria's top league. Algiers team USM Alger also offered its condolences. 'JS Kabylie's Cameroonian striker has lost his life after being hit in the head by something launched from the stands,' USM Alger said. 'This terrible news is saddening for football in our nation and in Cameroon and arrives like a bombshell.' Ebosse's body was transferred to a military hospital in preparation for it to be flown home to Cameroon, his club said.","Football player Albert Ebosse killed when hit by rock thrown from stands .

"By . James Nye . and Snejana Farberov for Mail online . A 12-year-old Michigan boy who has been charged with stabbing to death a nine-year-old neighbor  had been the victim of domestic abuse and lived in deplorable conditions, according to newly released court documents. An allegedly suicidal Jamarion Lawhorn knifed Michael Connor Verkerke four times in the back while they were on a playground earlier this month, having never met his victim before. Court filings obtained by WOOD-TV this week shed light on the young murder suspect's unstable home environment, where Jamarion was allegedly subjected to abuse at the hands of his mother and stepfather. Scroll down for video . Broken home: Anita Lawhorn, pictured with her son, Jamarion, left, allegedly abused the boy and his siblings, which resulted in temporary loss of custody in 1996 . Official . documents indicated that the teen lived in a 'deplorable' home with no . sheets or blankets on the beds, no utilities, and drug paraphernalia . scattered about the bathroom. Jamarion and his siblings also had no access to a primary care doctor or a dentist. Anita Lawhorn, Jamarion's mother, has had run-ins with the law dating back to 1996 concerning instances of child abuse. The . mother was forced to give up her daughters in upstate New York after . her one-year-old suffered four broken bones and her three-year-old was . found with cigarette burn marks on her chest. Just . days after Jamarion stabbed to death Michael Verkerke, the state . removed Ms Lawhorn's three remaining children between the ages of 2 and . 14. During . his interviews with police, the 12-year-old suspect said that he had . been mocked by other students in school, but he made no mention of abuse . at the hands of his parents. Bill . Verkerke, the victim's grandfather, expressed anger at state officials . upon learning of the abuse allegations concerning Anita Lawhron. ‘She . should be held criminally accountable,’ Connor Verkerke’s . grandfather told WOOD-TV. ‘Not only for what she did to her son, but maybe for what . her son did to my grandson.’ Furious: Bill Verkerke, the victim's grandfather, has pointed a finger of blame at Anita Lawhorn for his grandson's tragic death . The mother of four and her live-in boyfriend, Bernard Harrold, were investigated for child abuse in 2013, with Jamarion listed as the victim. The couple were forced to take parenting classes, but no charges have been filed against them. Jamarion Lawhorn spent several months living in upstate New York with his biological father,  Lonnell Washington, but he returned to his mother's home in Michigan in June. Following the deadly stabbing August 4, police found bruises all over on Jamarion Lawhorn’s body, which the boy said he suffered at the hands of his stepfather. Anita Lawhorn admitted to police that she and Bernard Harrold 'have been continuously threatening to give Jamarion a “whoppin’” on a daily basis.' The mother of four also said that she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, but has not been taking her medications, according to MLive.com. Mr Harrold also said he has PTSD and anxiety. Both Lawhorn and Harrold have tested positive for cocaine, according to court records. The Grand Rapids Press reported earlier this month that Anita has been beside herself since she rushed to Mercy Health Saint Mary's hospital August 4 to be with her 12-year-old. Horrific: .

Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, is charged with murder. He will be tried as an . adult in juvenile court. Even prosecutors said he looked small and young . for his age . Police . Jamarion didn't know Conner before the attack. They say the two boys . had been playing together when Jamarion pulled a knife out of the sand . and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back . 'She kept asking him why he did this, why he would stab a little boy, how he would feel if that had been someone else doing this to his sisters,' Kentwood police Officer Darrin Cline wrote in police reports, according to The Detroit Free Press. According to the harrowing police report of the brief time Anita spent with her son at the hospital, Jamarion showed little to no emotion as his mother scalded him. 'He had a stone-faced expression while his mother told him that he was going to be in a lot of trouble and that the boy had passed away. 'Lawhorn’s expression softened slightly when his mother was telling him that he was going to be gone for a long time facing the consequences of his actions. 'She told him that the next time he would set foot in her house would be when he is a grown man,' Cline wrote according to The Detroit Free Press. When asked by officers if there were any previous indicators that could have warned her about any disturbing behavior, Anita said that once, Jamarion set fire to her bed three years ago, to see what would happen. 'Anita said other than this he gets in trouble for normal kid things and she is shocked at his actions today,' the officer wrote. It was reported earlier this month that Jamarion told officers he had been planning his murder for a year. Jamarion Lawhorn also said he wanted to go to jail, did not know his young victim and that he's 'bad and always does stupid things', according to a delinquency petition filed in Kent County Circuit Court. WZZM 13 reported the teen wanted to die and 'take somebody with him', so he swallowed some pink pills he found at home, took an eight-inch steak knife from the kitchen and walked half a mile to the Pinebrook Village playground. Lawhorn then went up behind Michael ‘Connor’ Verkerke, 9 - who was playing at the small jungle gym with his brother and a friend - and stabbed him repeatedly in the back. About 100 people gathered two weeks ago to celebrate Connor's memory and sing Jesus Loves Me . Seriously injured, Connor was helped back to his home 100 feet away by his seven-year-old brother Kameron Verkerke. The boys' great uncle, Jim Stearns, told MLine that Connor, on the brink of death, told his brother: 'If anything happens to me, it’s not your fault. I’ll always love you.' Connor later died in hospital. Lawhorn left the playground and called police to turn himself in. He initially said he wasn't concerned for the victim, then said he was concerned because ""it made him feel stupid,"" an investigator wrote. He is designated as an adult in the juvenile court system, which would allow the boy, if convicted, to be sentenced as a juvenile and then as an adult once he turns 21. Lawhorn's attorney, Charles Boekeloo, has entered a not-guilty plea on behalf of his client client. Horrific: . A 9-year-old boy died at the hospital after being attacked on the . playground by a 12-year-old, police say. He was stabbed at least once in . the back with a kitchen knife . The Grand Rapids Press reported that Jamarion sobbed and trembled as he appeared in court two weeks ago to face murder charges. Even the prosecutor, who has opted to try him in juvenile court as an adult, remarked that he looked 'tiny' and younger than his age. His mother appeared in court with him and wiped away his tears and rubbed his back to comfort him. Jamarion's lawyer asked that the boy undergo a psychological examination to determine if he is fit to stand trial. The 12-year-old did, however, tell a judge that he understood the charges against him. Under Michigan law, Jamarion could be given a 'blended' sentence if he is convicted, which would keep him in a juvenile detention facility until he is 21. After that, a judge would determine whether he should be released or sent to adult prison. Random: . Police say the 12-year-old didn't know the young boy he attacked and he . didn't live in the trailer park near the playground . Police say that Jamarion's attack on Conner was unprovoked and inexplicable. He didn't know Conner before the attack and had joined the 9-year-old and two friends on the playground. Suddenly, he pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back, authorities say. Police aren't saying where Jamarion got the weapon. Conner ran to his home house nearby and collapsed on the porch. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition an died hours later. Authorities say Jamarion is the youngest child ever charged with murder in Kent County - and one of the youngest in the state of Michigan. An 11-year-old boy was convicted of killing his mother's boyfriend in 1997 in Pontiac, Michigan. Witness Glen Stacy told the Press he was doing yard work when Jamarion approached him and asked to borrow his cell phone. Mr Stacy said he assumed the child was calling him mother. Instead the 12-year-old called cops and admitted to a brutal crime. Mr Stacy says the boy told police: 'I want to die. I don’t want to be on this earth anymore. Please pick me up.' He says Jamarion told him that he lashed out because he had 'taken many pills' and nobody loved him. The 12-year-old was eerily calm and patiently waited for police, Mr Stacy told the Press. He only became animated when police finally arrived - and didn't immediately arrest him. Mr Stacy said the first emergency personnel went to the playground to help the victim. This upset the boy. 'Hello. I’m right here. You’re going the wrong way,' Jamarion shouted as officers arrived. When police did finally come for him, he walked toward the cops with his hands out in front of him - showing he wanted to be handcuffed.","Mother of 12-year-old Jamarion Lawhorn lost custody of two of her four children in the 90s over broken bones and burn marks .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . A pair of Indian teenagers being plucked from obscurity by a struggling sports agent to go and play professional baseball  - this is the fanciful story behind Disney's latest film - Million Dollar Arm. But amazingly, it is based on real life. Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel's incredible rags to riches story took them from extreme poverty to the bright lights and big money of Major League Baseball, completely transforming their lives - all thanks to a game show. Struggling sports agent J.B. Bernstein, played by Jon Hamm in the film, took a punt at rejuvenating his career by heading to India. His aim - trying to find boys who had never played the game before and turn them into huge stars. Scroll down for trailer . Real-life stars: Rinku Singh (left) and Dinesh Patel (right) are the inspiration behind new film Million Dollar Arm . Pitch perfect: Singh (left) and Patel (right) pose for a photo shoot in their Pittsburgh Pirates kit . Silver screen: The pair shown as depicted in the new hit Disney film, which stars Mad Men actor Jon Hamm . These boys turned out to be Singh and Patel - neither of whom had pitched a ball in their lives. They both lived in poverty-stricken villages in the state of Uttar Pradesh, in the north of the country, without running water - but ended up being flown to America and being put on the books of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Singh, the son of a truck driver from Bhadohi, lived with eight other siblings in just one room, while Patel was forced to be brought up by his grandmother in Khanpur as his parents were too poor to afford to raise him. But then along came The Million Dollar Arm - a reality TV show dreamt up by Bernstein which would literally pitch 37,000 hopefuls against each other for the prize of $100,000, a shot at a Major League Baseball contract - and a chance to change everything, not just for themselves, but for their families. Humble beginnings: Both Singh and Patel grew up in poverty, yet found themselves moving to America . Rags to pitches: The pair were signed up by MLB outfit the Pittsburgh Pirates and changed their lives forever . Singh emerged as the winner of the contest, and Patel as a talent too good to turn down. They suddenly found themselves moving to the USA after impressing scouts from the Pirates. The pair became the first Indians to sign American Major League Baseball contracts, and were flown to Florida to join the Pirates' training camp, before being sent to play for the organisation's Gulf Coast League affiliates - a rookie-level minor league team which help players prepare for an eventual career in MLB. Singh became the first Indian to make an appearance in a professional U.S. baseball game, with Patel close behind him, and they both enjoyed relatively successful starts to their careers. Their fairytale was a dream come true for their families back home - both boys were able to buy new homes for their parents with the money earned from their contracts. Pitching for success: Patel returned to India in 2010 and helped fellow villagers in the second Million Dollar Arm . In the money: The parents of Rinku Singh posing with the cheque for $100,000 he won as his prize . Singh, now 26, went on to play all over the world, including in the Dominican Rupublic and Australian leagues, and made the World All-Star team for the 2011 Australian Baseball League All-Star game. In 2010, he even met President Obama. After a hugely successful season with South Atlantic League side West Virginia Power in 2012, he missed the whole 2013 season through injury, and despite being invited to spring training by the Pittsburgh Pirates this year, will also miss the whole of this season as he undergoes elbow surgery. Patel meanwhile was released after two seasons with the Gulf Coast League Pirates,  and returned home to finish his studies. He helped boys in his village prepare for the second instalment of The Million Dollar Arm, free of charge, before returning to javelin - a sport he had succeeded in in his youth, and competed at the national athletics championships in 2011. Hollywood heroes: The two baseball players (standing right) as millions will see them in cinemas . Star of the show: Mad Men's Jon Hamm plays the struggling sports agent who discovers the two boys . The film is released today, and he has spoken about what a special moment it is for the two real-life stars, who have got to see their lives brought to Hollywood and the silver screen. 'It’s crazy that there is a film about our lives,' said Patel, 25. 'It was a beautiful moment when I watched the film, I was overwhelmed. 'Our lives over the last six years have been a dream come true - we could never imagine it. We're very thankful for all the opportunities that have come our way.' In the film, Singh is played by Suraj Sharma, and Patel by Madhur Mittal. It has received fairly positive reviews, being rated 61 per cent by critics on Rotten Tomatoes.","Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel are the inspiration behind Million Dollar Arm .

A postwoman left a cancer-stricken elderly man and his wife without their post for two weeks - because she refused to duck under their handing baskets to deliver it for them. Peter and Hazel Kelly, from Woburn Sands, Buckinghamshire, missed out on bank statements, an invitation and a letter from the hospital, all because the postwoman said it hurt her back to avoid the two large hanging baskets. Until now they had received nothing but praise for their annual floral display, with photographs being used on calendars and postcards. Scroll down for video . Peter Kelly said that his local postman will no longer deliver mail to his house because of the hanging baskets . Not all roses round the door: Peter and Hazel Kelly complained after missing out on two weeks of post . Mrs Kelly, 76, said the gardening helps her 75-year-old husband -  who is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, having been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. She said: 'We couldn't understand why we hadn't any post for two weeks. My husband was outside the front tidying up and saw the postwoman. He said: ""Good morning my duck, we haven't had any letters for a while"" and she said ""No I am not delivering to you no more"". 'She said it was damaging her back to get to the front door. They are tied in place securely at the front of the porch and if it was that much of a problem for her to get past she could have put them on the mat.

People say it is a little ray of sunshine,' said Mrs Kelly - who has four children, 12 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. 'We have been doing the baskets for 30 years. A couple who had just got married knocked on the door and asked if they could have their pictures taken and one Chinese lady was so taken with our garden she bought 60 postcards of Woburn Sands to send as Christmas cards. 'We do the garden and baskets together and it helps my husband who has been going through a very hard time with his chemo.' It's not difficult!

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . The ice bucket challenge has been completed by some of the world's biggest names - but an average Joe from Derbyshire might have just done the most impressive one yet. Jack Reynolds, from Hollinghead, near Chesterfield, is a whopping 102 years old - but was not fazed as he had the freezing bucket of water tipped over his head - while wearing nothing but Union Jack underpants. The widower, who has four children, eight grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren, is believed to be the oldest person to complete the challenge, which raises money for ALS, also known as motor neurone disease. Scroll down for video . Golden oldie: 102-year-old Jack Reynolds was not fazed by the bucket of freezing water poured over his head . Once he was done, he joked around by miming swimming underwater, before celebrating with a glass of his favourite whisky. 'I'm game for a laugh, it was one of those things,' said the centenarian. 'It was cold but I had ten young ladies come to dry me out afterwards so I liked that. 'I've lived through two World Wars so a bucket of ice and water wouldn't phase me! 'I did it because of my family, they are fun-makers, they do all sorts of daft things and I have to be ready for anything. Thumbs up: The centenarian jokes about before the event (left) and then mimes swimming once it is over . 'It was very chilly - in fact it was bloody cold, especially just in Union Jack boxer shorts. 'But some lovely women with a warm towel and a shot of Grouse whisky soon warmed me up!' Mr Reynolds was nominated for the challenge by his ten-year-old great-granddaughter Shannon Spancer and a member of his Austrailian family, Julia Woollacott, 22. He did not hesitate to accept, and immediately gathered his family in his back garden to watch. Grandson Shane Spencer, who filmed the event,  put the video on Facebook and it has already been shared more than 3,750 times. 'It's incredible, so many people have seen it,' said the 32-year-old, also from Chesterfield. The Ice Bucket Challenge is the brainchild of former Division 1 baseball player Peter Frates, who was diagnosed with ALS in 2012. It first took off in Boston, where the 29-year-old played, but has quickly spread all over the world, raising more than £48m for MND charities. Partakers simply film themselves pouring a bucket of ice cold water over their heads and then share it on social media, nominating friends to do the same. The forfeit is donating money to the foundation, though those that do take it on are also encouraged to donate. 'He was definitely up for it, he is up for anything. He has done all sorts in the past. He is always game for a laugh, his age doesn't hold him back at all. 'As soon as he knew what it was he wanted to do it. 'He is on Facebook so he is very up-to-date with these things, he had been watching all his grandchildren and great grandchildren doing it. 'Straight away when the nomination came through he went into his room and came out in his Union Jack boxer shorts and said, ""right, let's go"".' After completing the challenge he nominated Carl Walters, his great grandson, and Carlene Walters, his great granddaughter, as well as Julia Woollacott's brother Rosko Dela Bosko. Mr Reynolds' daughter Jayne said her father is a regular iPad and Facebook user, and was never going to shy away from the challenge. 'My dad is an amazing man. He went into the bedroom and just came out in a pair of Union Jack boxer shorts. Afterwards he just sat down and had a whisky, that's what keeps him going,' she said. Despite his age, the daredevil centenarian still lives alone and continues to carry out all his household tasks apart from the gardening. He said: 'My longevity is due to hard work and fresh air all my life, always being happy and smiling, a shot of Grouse whiskey in my tea first thing in a morning and a shot at night and especially through the care and joy my doting family brings me!' Mr Reynolds worked at Staveley Coal and Iron Company for 40 years, before retiring 39 years ago in 1975. He will be making a donation to the Motor Neurone Disease Association, adding to the £48m already raise by the challenge in total. More than 1.7m people have donated in less than a month, including Lady Gaga, David Beckham and George W. Bush. The video of a man who took part in the ice bucket challenge just 20 minutes after his brother died from cancer has gone viral - being shared more than 3,000 times. When grieving Alan Lucas, 56, stepped up to play his part, the usual slapstick comedy event instead became a poignant and emotionally charged tribute to the brother he had just lost. Mr Lucas had only just learnt that his brother Paul had lost his fight against cancer. Paul, a joiner from Slateford in Edinburgh, died aged 59, only eight weeks after being diagnosed. Still reeling from the news of his loss, Alan opted to fulfil his part of the global challenge to raise money for cancer charity Macmillan. He did the challenge alongside his wife Pam, and even found it in himself to slip on her swimsuit to add a bit of humour. 'I didn't do it because I wanted any attention,' said Mr Lucas. 'I just wanted to give something back to Macmillan, whose nurses had helped Paul. 'Their nurses were there for the family and were amazing. This was a way of raising awareness of the great job they do.' Construction workers complete extreme ice bucket challenge . Construction workers have staged an ice bucket challenge by pouring water down a rubbish chute from the top of an 80ft building. In one of the most ambitious challenges yet, a man in a high visibility jacket climbs into a skip at the bottom of the chute. He is covered in ice cold water as it comes gushing out of the tube. The stunt prompts plenty of laughter from his colleagues, with many of them filming it on their phones. The footage at an unknown location, believed to be in England, has been posted on YouTube and is attracting much attention on social media websites.","Jack Reynolds completed challenge wearing nothing but Union Jack pants .

A lot of Brits would have been stumbling for an early morning kebab on Bank Holiday Monday - but one man was more eager than the rest - and ended up ploughing his car right through the front of a takeaway shop. The hapless motorist, 29, lost control of his Ford Fiesta and crashed backwards through the window of Flames fast food outlet in Smallthorne, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs at around 8am. After clambering from the wreckage showered with glass, he then told stunned witnesses: 'I better call my mum'. Aw shish! The hapless driver lost control of his car before ending up back-first through the takeaway window . The man was arrested at the scene. A police spokesman said: 'He was held on suspicion of failing to provide a roadside breath test sample and obstructing a constable in execution of his duty. 'He was bailed to return to a police station at a later date.' Staff  put on a brave face after discovering the car parked right through the window of their shop - by joking the driver must have been hungry for a snack. Nidal Mansour, who works at Flames, said: 'I saw a picture of a car inside the takeaway on the internet and I thought it was a fake so I went down to have a look. 'I don't understand how the car managed to reverse into the shop. It fitted exactly through the window.

Leaflet deliveryman Matthew Houghton, 30, said he felt lucky to be alive after the vehicle smashed through the window just seconds before he walked past the takeaway. 'I heard a noise as if a car was bouncing off the kerb,' he said. 'I looked up and saw a Fiesta swerving all over the pace. It must have clipped the lamppost because I saw the light in the middle of the road. 'It started doing a 360-degree turn, spinning out, and as he levelled out, his back end swung round across the road, and went straight through the takeaway and there was a big smash. 'I couldn't believe it because it came out of nowhere. 'I watched it happening right in front of me and it felt like it was in slow motion. Business as usual: The window has been boarded up and the takeaway is able to stay open despite the crash . 'The driver got out of the car and I ran over. He was obviously worried and started swearing. 'He said he couldn't believe what had happened and that he better ring his mum. 'If it had happened 30 seconds later I would have been outside of Flames when he drove through it. ' Witness Peat Mueller, 67, who was driving past at the time, added: 'I was driving along Ford Green Road and my son noticed it at first - it was an unusual thing to see. 'The car was parked backwards inside the takeaway and the window was smashed It's quite amazing.' The driver only suffered minor injuries, and a spokesman for Staffordshire Police confirmed nobody else was hurt during the incident. He said: 'We were called out to a single road traffic collision in Ford Green Road, in Smallthorne, at 8.06am. 'A vehicle had collided with a building shop window.

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Alan Pardew fears losing Cheick Tiote this month having been scarred by the sales of Andy Carroll and Yohan Cabaye. The Newcastle midfielder has been the subject of a £4million bid from Lokomotiv Moscow and Sportsmail understands he wants to quit St James’ Park. United rejected that ‘derisory’ offer and it is thought they want £14m for the former FC Twente anchorman. VIDEO Scroll down for Alan Pardew's reaction to Newcastle's defeat to Manchester City . Keen to leave: Cheick Tiote wants to leave Newcastle after Lokomotiv Moscow expressed interest in him . Blow: Pardew says he is confident the player will stay but admits he can't be sure with big clubs lurking . Pardew is desperate to keep Tiote on Tyneside but he was also against the sales of Carroll – to Liverpool for £35m in 2011 – and Cabaye, who joined PSG for £20m in January. And, when asked if he had a contingency plan in place should Tiote go, Pardew said: ‘Yes. I've got Andy Carroll experience here and that's one of the benefits of being here for four years. ‘But I never think that you can be safe with a player if you're not in the Champions League. ‘You've got to be on your toes at all times and I have to say I think we have been. ‘We've had (speculation) in the past. Some of it carries weight - there were a lot of rumours last season with Cabaye and PSG and it happened so I'm always open minded about it. Scarred: Past experience has meant Pardew is making sure that he has alternative options . Deadline decisions: Both Cabaye and Carroll left Newcastle right at the end of a transfer window . ‘I'm as confident as I can be with any player that he will stay.’ Tiote – at 28 years old – is believed to want a big-money move and Arsenal have also been linked with the Ivory Coast international. But Pardew added: ‘I heard there were a couple of derisory offers and I mean like way short of his valuation. Therefore we've not really entertained any serious thought of him leaving. ‘He's just a great player, a top player. Top players demand top fees if they are going to move, but at the moment that isn't the case.’ Tiote is currently sidelined with a hamstring strain and will miss tomorrow’s lunchtime trip to Aston Villa. Jack Colback started last Sunday’s 2-0 defeat to Manchester City and was United’s best player on his debut. Pardew, though, was not surprised by his impressive start. Impressive: Jack Colback starred on the opening day of the season despite defeat to Manchester City . ‘From the day he walked in here, he has looked what I hoped he was going to be, a player who can carry the Newcastle shirt,’ said the Magpies boss. ‘It's a big shirt, it carries responsibility and the role I have given him carries more responsibility than perhaps he had at Sunderland, and I think he is enjoying that. ‘I want him to express himself a little bit more, and I think he will prove that too. We are really, really pleased with him.’ Meanwhile, Italian left-back Davide Santon has been ruled out for three months with a knee injury. ‘It's not good news,’ said Pardew. ‘When the surgeon looked at his knee there was a little bit more damage than we thought. ‘That now looks like mid-November now rather than October. He had an operation in the summer and he's our long-term injury at this time.’","Lokomotiv Moscow bid of £4million rejected .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Tenderly caressing and nuzzling each other, they look like the epitome of lovebirds. This amorous pair of African lovebirds were spotted by tourist guide Paul Harding, 56,  at the Birds of Eden sanctuary, Western Cape, South Africa. He said: 'The birds were sat on a branch cuddling and canoodling – they were definitely the epitome of lovebirds. 'One was lovingly grooming and caressing the other and they seemed oblivious to their surroundings. 'The pure joy and pleasure of the birds together is difficult to describe but it caught my eye – their embrace is so close and emotional. 'I do not think the birds could have got any closer and they were completely absorbed by each other. Nothing else seemed important.' African lovebirds are a species of parrot native to Africa and they mate for life, often spending long periods sitting together. Birds of Eden is the world's largest free flight aviary, housing approximately 3,500 birds of 220 species from different continents.

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . Alan Blacker, pictured, was given a public dressing down by a judge for looking 'something out of Harry Potter' in court . A furious judge gave a lawyer a public dressing down for looking like 'something out of Harry Potter' in court. Judge David Wynn Morgan tore into solicitor-advocate Alan Blacker who bears a striking resemblance to Hagrid in the Harry Potter films. Mr Blacker had sewn a set of what he claimed were ceremonial St John Ambulance medals on his left breast along with colourful ribbons. Judge Morgan told him: 'If you want to look like something out of Harry Potter you can forget coming to this court ever again. 'I have been practising in these courts since 1978 and I have never seen a barrister or solicitor appear before these courts wearing a medal or with badges sewn onto his gown. 'Here in South Wales we had a barrister, who later became a judge, who had won during the Battle of Normandy the highest order of gallantry in a Victoria Cross. 'Did you ever see him wearing a medal? He would have considered it the height of vulgarity for such a thing to be done. 'If you ever appear before this court again dressed as you are I shall exercise my right to decline to hear you.' Mr Blacker goes by the full name of Dr The Right Honourable The Lord Harley of Counsel of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. Mr Blacker's extraordinary dressing down happened at Cardiff Crown Court where he was representing a minibus driver accused of causing death by dangerous driving. After the trial Judge Morgan questioned Mr Blacker's right as a solicitor advocate to wear the robes and wig of a barrister during the trial and asked whether he was a member of the Law Society. Mr Blacker, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, explained he earned the title Lord Harley by inheriting an ancient Irish peerage from his father and was a fully qualified solicitor advocate allowed to wear the robes of a barrister. Mr Blacker lists an extraordinary number of qualifications, languages and society memberships on his LinkedIn professional networking web page. It carries glowing testimonials which describe him as the 'Mozart of the courtroom' and 'almost a national treasure'. Judge David Wynn Morgan tore into legal advocate Alan Blacker, left, who bears a striking resemblance to Hagrid in the Harry Potter films, right . And he also states he is fluent in Urdu, Punjabi, Gujarati, Hindi, and the Luo language of Kenya and Tanzania. After the case Mr Blacker said: 'My qualifications, status and offices were brought into disrepute and I was personally very upset by the comments made towards me. 'I am shocked to the core that my position has been questioned - which is I feel reflective of the sacrifice of thousands of men who have died for the freedoms that are referred to in the title of Lord Harley for almost 1,100 years. 'For his Honour to have criticised me in such a way has hurt me deeply. 'I cannot say any more for legal reasons but I am deeply upset for what I consider were baseless and unjustified comments. Alan Blacker, pictured says his 'bona fides are beyond reproach' after he was given a dressing down over his courtroom clothing . Alan Blacker, pictured right, described the comments by Judge David Wynn Morgan, pictured left, as 'baseless and unjustified' 'I asked to see the judge in his chambers afterwards and he declined and now I have to take advice on the matter. 'My bona fides are beyond any reproach.' Today, the 42-year-old said: 'The medals are there to balance the playing field. 'My medals were awarded to me and bear the face of the Crown. They may be for voluntary medical service but they bear the face of the Queen. 'They are not some poxy swimming badge. 'They are very discreet and are there for when I appear in superior courts - it has never been an issue before.' It is not clear what branch of St John Ambulance he belongs to. Mr Black said he represented people who cannot afford representation and often received little or no payment for his services. He added: 'My reputation is widely known. 'I come from Lancashire, I speak with a Lancashire accent and work with Lancashire folk - I am nothing special. 'The trial isn't about me but when I am criticised personally throughout the trial the jury take a view of that.' Mr Blacker's client minibus driver Andrzej Wojcicki, 45, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. Polish-born Wojcicki was looking at photographs on his mobile phone when he collided with cyclist Owain James, 30, at Newbridge, South Wales.","Alan Blacker had sewn ceremonial medals and colourful ribbons on gown .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . Welsh international rugby star Ian Gough has been ordered to pay £2,130 in fines and costs after attacking his beauty queen ex-girlfriend just days after she got engaged to pop star Dane Bowers. The 37-year-old player grabbed and pushed former Miss Wales Sophia Cahill against his van as he dropped their two-year-old son off at her house on January 5. Miss Cahill said she was so shaken up by the attack that she fled in tears back to the south London home she shares with 1990s singer Bowers, to whom she got engaged over the Christmas break.

She did not attend Gough's sentencing at Croydon Magistrates' Court in south London today but a victim impact statement read out on her behalf said she has suffered from anxiety and panic attacks since the incident. Prosecutor Christian Wheeliker said the medication she must take for them means that she is unable to drive, affecting her work as a TV presenter. Miss Cahill also complained of becoming the target of harassment by Gough's family and the victim of allegations on social media. Mr Wheeliker said that, as a professional rugby player, Gough - who split up with Miss Cahill in 2011, when she was pregnant with their son - was 'by definition a powerful and strong man'. Miss Cahill, in contrast, was 'by all accounts, a small lady'. But Mark Haslam, defending Newport Gwent Dragons player Gough, contested Miss Cahill's claim that she cannot drive, saying she had been spotted behind the wheel of her white Jeep in Swansea on Tuesday. He described the assault as 'one isolated incident' which happened during one of many meetings between the former couple as they picked up or dropped off their son.

Mr Haslam said a 'breakdown in communication' had led to a series of acrimonious phone calls between the pair that evening as Gough was late dropping the toddler off and the defendant reacted when Miss Cahill went to get the child out of his van because he liked to do this himself as part of his 'ritual'. 'He is a loving father and on this occasion all he was trying to achieve was his normal way of saying goodbye to his son as he handed him over,' Mr Haslam said. 'It is perfectly clear the physical contact was very limited and over a very short space of time.' He reiterated that Miss Cahill suffered no signs of physical injury from the attack and Gough was of previous good character with no convictions or cautions.

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . A gay couple who claim they were kicked out of a cab on a busy Chicago freeway last year just for sharing a kiss are suing the taxi company that employed the driver. Matthew McCrea and Steven White filed the lawsuit against Sun Taxi in Cook County Circuit Court, Illinois, on Monday, claiming afterwards that 'there is still discrimination' towards gay people and 'people that are against us'. The pair already filed a complaint last year with the Illinois Department of Human Rights against the taxi company and the driver, Jama Anshur. Scroll down for video . Suing:  Matthew McCrea (right) and Steven White (left) filed the lawsuit against Sun Taxi in Cook County Circuit Court, Illinois, on Monday . Anshur was fined $1,540 by the Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection and was also fired over the incident, which took place on May 30 2013. Mr McCrea and Mr White had flown from L.A. to Chicago O’Hare International Airport and were heading back to Mr McCrea’s apartment when they jumped into the taxi. After sharing what they say was a short kiss, Anshur became adamant they exit the cab, claiming 'you can't do this -this is public transportation'. When they protested, he began 'driving recklessly and swerving into traffic', reports the Chicagoist. He ejected them on the Kennedy Expressway in the pouring rain at around midnight prompting the couple to call the police. One-second kiss: In an interview after the incident, the couple demonstrated what the kiss was like that got them thrown out of the taxi on to a busy freeway . When officers arrived, the driver, who was waiting in a grocery store in Park Ridge, said they were 'making sex' in the back of his cab  - a claim strongly denied by Mr McCrea and Mr White. The couple say their kiss was a second in length and was something any heterosexual couple could do without drawing any negative repercussions. Anshur has since claimed: 'I told them to stop, it was raining. I couldn't drive with something like that. I have to drive safely because it's raining,' ABC News reports. Pick up: The men were collected in a taxi outside Chicago O’Hare International Airport (above -  cab pictured is from a different company and in no way associated with the incident) In a recent interview with WGN TV, Steven White said: 'Even in states like Illinois, where gays and lesbians are protected by the law, there is still discrimination and there are people that are against us. 'So I think it's just bringing more attention to the issue.' The pair are suing for an undisclosed amount of money.

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . Controversial footage claiming to show the wreckage of an Israeli drone shot down near an Iranian power plant has been aired on television in Iran. The video has prompted questions about how a plane with limited range could have penetrated so deeply into the country and whether it is indeed what Tehran says it is. The brief clip showed what the channel described as parts of the battleship-gray drone scattered in an unidentified desert area. The unmanned device was identified as a Hermes 450, a known Israeli model. Scroll down for video . This photo, released by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, claims to show the wreckage of an Israeli drone shot down by Iran near a nuclear site, 150 miles south of Tehran . There were no visible Israeli markings on the aircraft, a Hermes 450,  in the footage and Israel's military has refused to comment on the matter . There were no visible Israeli markings on the aircraft and Israel's military has refused to comment on the matter. The claim comes as Iran negotiates with world powers over its contested nuclear program and Iranian hard-liners press moderate President Hassan Rouhani to demand more concessions before limiting the country's atomic capabilities. The West suspects Iran's nuclear program is geared toward building a nuclear weapon - however the country denies the charge, saying its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes only, such as power generation and medical research. Israel has not ruled out taking unilateral military action against Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard said in a statement on Sunday that its forces fired a missile as the drone neared Iran's uranium enrichment facility in Natanz,150 miles south of the capital, Tehran. Guard spokesman General Ramazan Sharif also said that Iran allowed the drone to continue its path to find out more about its mission. General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard's airspace division, has insisted the drone was Israeli, though he said its last flight originated elsewhere . General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Guard's airspace division, insisted on Monday that the drone was Israeli, though he said its last flight originated elsewhere. He said: 'The operational range of the drone indicates it did not start its flight in Israel but departed from a country in the region. We have some clues.' Iranian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham condemned the drone's presence as a violation of Iranian territorial integrity and said 'pursuing the case in legal and international bodies is our right', the semi-official Fars news agency reported. Mr Hajizadeh said the drone's range was about 500 miles and that it had two front and side cameras capable of providing high-resolution panoramic imaging. However, the manufacturer of the Hermes 450, Israel-based Elbit Systems, lists its base range as only 200 miles. Israel is about 620 miles away from Iran's westernmost boundary and Natanz is about 370 miles inland from the closest border point in Iran. Other countries also operate Hermes 450 drones, including Britain, the United States and Azerbaijan, Iran's neighbor to the north. Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard (pictured above testing missiles in 2006) believe the drone was launched by Israel from another country in the region . Iranian state-linked media previously touted Iranian-made drones that bore some resemblance to the Israeli model. According to British aviation expert Paul E. Eden, this could be what is shown in the footage. Mr Eden said it is possible that the Israeli drone could operate beyond its official range, but he too was skeptical given how far into Iranian airspace the drone would have penetrated. He said: 'If this seems to be posing a threat, you don't let it fly for hundreds of miles. It doesn't ring true.' Israel considers Iran's nuclear program to be a grave threat, and Israeli intelligence closely monitors the program. Iran's nuclear program has been targeted by espionage and sabotage efforts in the past. In 2010, the so-called Stuxnet virus temporarily disrupted operation of thousands of centrifuges, key components in nuclear fuel production, at Natanz. Iran says it and other computer virus attacks are part of a concerted effort by Israel, the U.S. and their allies to undermine its nuclear program through covert operations. Israel has never commented on the allegations but is widely believed to have been involved in the Stuxnet attack. Iran has also said that it discovered tiny timed explosives planted on centrifuges but disabled them before they could go off.","Iran's military say they brought down aircraft appearing to be Israeli model .

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . Jailed uncle: Drunk Clarence W. Hairston, of Pennsylvania, was arrested after allowing his eight-year-old nephew to sit on his lap and steer his car . An extremely drunk driver was arrested clutching a can of beer behind the wheel of his car while his eight-year-old nephew sat on his lap to steer. Clarence W. Hairston, of Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, told police he was doing nothing wrong and 'was only letting the kids go for a drive' after the shocking incident on Saturday. The 58-year-old caught the attention of officers after they noticed his blue Chevy Impala blocking traffic as it stopped in the middle of the street outside his home. As they approached the vehicle, it began to make a series of 'stop and go' movements before narrowly avoiding a collision with a parked car, CBS Philly reports. When police eventually reached the car, officers were stunned to find Hairston in the driver's seat with his eight-year-old nephew sitting on his lap. Police say Hairston was operating the gas and brake pedals while drinking a can Bud Ice can. Meanwhile, his nephew was manning the steering wheel, with another nephew, aged nine, sitting in the back of the car. When Hairston got out, he was said to be unsteady on his feet and have blood-shot eyes and slurred speech while also smelling strongly of alcohol. After claiming to have done nothing wrong, he then suggested he was also a member of the Philadelphia Police Department, telling officers 'it's not right to jam up another cop'. It is believed Hairston was supposed to be babysitting his nephews, who were both returned to their mother unharmed. Upper Darby Police Superintendent, Michael Chitwood, said: 'I would have rather seen the kid take the car and drive away. 'Not only could he have endangered those two children in the car who apparently were his nephews but he could have endangered an entire community.' A woman who calls herself Hairston's fiancée has disputed the police's version of events, claiming he would never have put his nephews in danger. He is now facing a long list of charges that include driving under the influence, endangering the welfare of a child, recklessly endangering another person and permitting unauthorized person to drive and public drunkenness. He remains behind bars with a $15,000 cash bail.","Clarence W. Hairston stopped by police outside home in Pennsylvania after they spotted his Chevy Impala making series of 'stop and go' movements .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Around 110 million Americans are now receiving government assistance, one third of the country . A third of Americans are now on welfare benefits, prompting calls to raise the minimum wage and encourage more people to stay in work. New census data has revealed that around 110 million Americans are receiving government assistance of some kind. The number includes people receiving 'means-tested' federal benefits and subsidies based on income. Those receiving food stamps, subsidised housing and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families are also included in the total. At the end of 2012 around 83 million were collecting Medicaid and 51.5 million were on food stamps, with some benefitting from multiple programs. Analysts have raised concerns that the programs are encouraging people to stay at home rather than work. They pointed out that when recipients combine several government assistance programs, in many cases they pay better than going to work. Michael Tanner, from Cato Institute think tank said that in the eight most generous states, the benefits are comparable to  a $20 minimum wage. This would exceed the $7.25 minimum wage in most states. 'So in many cases people could actually do better on welfare than they could in an entry level job,' said Mr Tanner. Supporters say the safety net is necessary to keep Americans from living in dire conditions. And many argue that a solution would be to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. 'I think a lot of people would do the jobs when they pay a living wage,' said Melissa Boteach, from the Center for American Progress. 'In addition, there's growing jobs in health care and information technology and energy. There's a lot of places where, if able to make investments, we can really grow our economy in those sectors.' Tanner said there must be a serious effort to put people back to work because the continued growth of government assistance programs is unsustainable. President Obama urged Congress to reinstate jobless benefits for more than a million Americans this year . 'You can't in the long run have a society in which you have to rely on a smaller and smaller group of wealth producers who have to support more and more people who are not contributing to that wealth,' he said. The number of people on such benefits is up slightly from 2011. The government still runs a half-trillion dollar deficit, according to the most recent estimates, and the national debt is nearing $18 trillion. Heritage Foundation analyst Rachel Sheffield has criticised President Obama's plan to vastly increase spending on welfare. She also accused the Obama administration of giving Americans less incentive to find work and eventually free themselves from public assistance. 'Unfortunately, the federal government tends to measure welfare success by the number of people receiving benefits,' she said.","Around 110 million Americans are now on government welfare benefits .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . A bar has been forced to close after hosting a naked game night where people played strip Twister, according to the owner. The League Brewpub, storefront of the Brewery Incubator, Houston, was handed an eviction notice earlier this month following a complaint from someone who witnessed the nude game. Owner Lucrece Borrego claims that naked game nights are now taking place regularly across the Texas city and says that all the windows were covered during the private party. Brewery Incubator, Houston, Texas, has been served an eviction notice after hosting a naked game night . A complaint was made after someone witnessed a game of strip Twister at the Houston brewpub . She said: 'Indeed, I had agreed to host a naked game night, a completely private event that takes place at bars all over Houston regularly. 'We covered all the windows and had someone working the door. Only one thing went wrong, an employee of the architectural services firm next door that has access to our hallways was working long after business hours and stumbled up a game of strip Twister in the hall. 'Whoever this person was, he or she had clearly never seen the naked male body before and took great offence to the incident, crying 'public nudity' to the landlord. 'Never would a game of strip Twister be so badly regretted.' The brewery collective was given just five days notice to vacate the premises following the 'public nudity' incident, as Ms Borrego was unable to pay legal fees to fight the case. Owner of League Brewpub, Lucrece Borrego, claims that naked game nights are now taking place regularly across Houston . Twister is a classic children's game played on a plastic mat where people follow instructions and place either their hands or feet on different colours . She said: 'The notice seemed like a joke. They claimed rent had been late, but still, they acknowledged it was received and I could prove it was mailed in time. 'They cited 'misuse' of the premises as the reason. Lumped together these are kegs in the hallway in between deliveries and pick-up and the clincher, a game of strip Twister. 'The notice even cited my Facebook event share post 'condoning' the naked games. 'I was certain that I could fight this. After all, I have a commercial lease. How can they just kick me out with five days notice? 'I immersed myself in internet research and frantically met with lawyers, learning my rights and the eviction procedures. 'They assured me I could fight this and win, but said it's going to cost you. And the landlord can keep doing it again and again until you're out. And he wants you out. 'Essentially, I was faced with an indefinite expensive legal battle, or to abandon my life savings and dream. I'm not sure if that's a decision anyone can really make. I can't afford the legal battle. The decision was made for me. It's that simple.' The bar hosted an eviction party and any proceeds will be used to fight the legal battle. Brewery Incubator, a collective that helps new brewers test the waters of going commercial, officially launched in 2012 following a successful Kickstarter campaign.","Brewery Incubator, Houston, forced to close after hosting naked game night .
