"(CNN) -- Manchester City football player Kolo Toure has expressed his relief after receiving only a six-month suspension for using a banned drug. The Ivory Coast international will miss the start of the 2011-12 season, but can return to action from September 2 after the punishment for taking weight-loss pills was backdated. ""This has been a difficult period for me, and I am sad to have missed the team's triumph of securing Champions League football for Manchester City and also the FA Cup victory at Wembley,"" Toure told the English club's website after Thursday's ruling. ""But I am relieved that I will be able to return to football in September and thank the FA's commission for their understanding about my case in coming to their decision."" Toure faced a possible two-year ban after admitting to using water tablets given to him by his wife, but several factors meant he escaped the maximum penalty. Wenger blames Toure positive test on diet pill . One member of the panel recommended that the 30-year-old be sidelined for just three months as it was his first offense and he admitted his guilt. Lawyer Christopher Quinlan, who headed the English Football Association's independent panel, said Toure ""did not intend to enhance sporting performance or to mask the use of a performance-enhancing substance."" ""The player accepted he was at fault and with that concession we agree,"" Quinlan said in a statement on the FA's website. ""He was at fault in the limited and perfunctory efforts he made in relation to the water tablets; the checks he made in relation to those tablets were inadequate and fell some way below what it would be reasonable to expect of a professional footballer in these circumstances."" Toure, who will be target-tested for drug use for the next two years, was provisionally suspended on March 2. The defender had to watch from the sidelines as City qualified for Europe's premier club competition for the first time, finishing third in Premier League. His younger brother Yaya scored the winning goal in both the semifinal and final of the FA Cup, England's prestigious knockout competition, as City ended a 35-year wait to lift a trophy.","Kolo Toure relieved after receiving a backdated six-month ban for using diet pills .

"Madrid (CNN) -- The European Commission on Wednesday rescinded its health warning against cucumbers from Spain, according to a statement from the Spanish Health Ministry. Spanish officials have been denying accusations that their country was the cause of a deadly E. coli outbreak that has swept across Germany and Sweden. The health warning was lifted after Spanish authorities shared negative test results on the produce in question with the commission, the statement noted. Last week, German officials implied Spanish cucumbers were the cause of an illness that has sickened more than 1,000 people. The outbreak is responsible for 15 deaths in Germany and one in Sweden, according to media reports citing local authorities. CNN has confirmed at least 12 deaths including the one in Sweden, a woman who had recently visited Germany. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Spain will not rule out ""taking action against the authorities (in Germany) who questioned the quality of our products."" He was speaking in an SER radio interview. The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal unit responsible for disease control and prevention, has reported 1,064 cases of E. coli infection, and 470 cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious complication that can result from E. coli. Rubalcaba later responded forcefully to the accusation that the outbreak originated with produce from Spain after chairing a meeting of government officials and fresh produce exporters Wednesday in the southern city of Almeria. ""What we ask of Germany is get to the bottom of this,"" Rubalcaba told a nationally televised news conference after the meeting. ""The country most interested in knowing the truth is Spain. It's not our products. All of the people who are affected are in Hamburg or were in Hamburg, so it seems the problem is there."" ""The proof is that there are no cases in Spain. If the bacteria came from Spain, we would see infections. Our products are absolutely clean, our cucumbers in this case. It's not a problem of the origin of the products,"" Rubalcaba said. ""If it was from the cucumbers, there would be cases (of illness) in Spain,"" Rubalcaba said, adding that there haven't been. ""The Hamburg (Germany) authorities don't know where it comes from. I understand they have a problem. We have said, 'You need to say it wasn't us.' "" While authorities in Germany worked to contain and respond to the outbreak, the specific cause remained unclear. The European Food Safety Alert Network said EHEC, or enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhaging in the intestines, was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain. But the source has not yet been pinpointed, authorities said. Spanish officials and export producers have talked publicly of demanding compensation from Germany or the European Union. The produce export sector says it stands to lose $290 million a week, as consumer fears over cucumbers have spread to most European countries, largely stopping imports of Spanish produce, including tomatoes, lettuce and other vegetables. Rubalcaba told the news conference there'll be time to talk about demands for proper compensation but added, ""It's evident they have endangered the jobs of many people without proof. We know (the infection) is a serious problem, but the Spanish products have nothing to do with that crisis."" Health officials in Hamburg, where many remain hospitalized from the infection, said Thursday that Spanish cucumbers appeared to carry the E. coli. But on Tuesday, they said two of the three Spanish cucumbers tested showed they did not carry the E. coli strain that has caused the health problems, while a third Spanish cucumber and another cucumber of unknown origin were still being tested. Spanish media reported that as a significant backtracking by Germany. The export producers federation Fepex issued a statement Wednesday saying the ""priority now is to return to normal in the European markets for fruits and vegetables and re-establish confidence in Spanish products after Germany corrected itself on Tuesday and removed Spanish cucumbers as the origin of the lethal strain of E. coli."" Germany is the top purchaser of Spain's produce, according to Fepex. In 2010, Spain exported 9.4 million tons of produce; a quarter of that went to Germany, Fepex said. Fresh produce exports had $11 billion in revenue overall in 2010.

"(CNN) -- A 73-year-old man shot dead five people around Yuma, Arizona, before turning a gun on himself, police said. Another victim was flown about 180 miles northeast to a Phoenix-area hospital after being seriously injured, Yuma Police Sgt. Clint Norred said in a joint press release with the Yuma County Sheriff's Office. According to Yuma police, an ""elderly male"" went into a business in the city limits and shot an adult male. Police Chief Jerry Geier later identified this victim as Jerrold Shelley, a local attorney. The four others were killed in greater Yuma County, where the other person was injured, according to Yuma Police Officer Cruz Vidal. Police determined that these shootings were linked and identified the suspect as Carey Hal Dyess, a 73-year-old Yuma man. Around 11:30 a.m., Yuma County sheriff's deputies found Dyess dead off U.S. Highway 95 in Blaisdell, a community east of Yuma. He died from ""what appears to be ... a self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" police said. Yuma is a city of more than 87,000 people, according to a 2006 U.S. Census Bureau estimate, out of nearly 200,000 people in the county. It is near the intersection of Arizona, California and Mexico, about 170 miles east of San Diego.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- As searches for nearly 13,000 missing continued Sunday, police in Japan said 8,199 people had died since the monster earthquake and ensuing tsunami struck last week. Meanwhile, the March 11 tremors shifted the Oshika Peninsula near the epicenter by just over 17 feet and dropped it by just over 4 feet, the Geospatial Information Authority in Tsukuba, Japan, reported Saturday. Those two land mass movements are records for Japan, according to government figures. The global positioning system data from the Tsukuba University-based authority revealed the peninsula on the Pacific coast moved in an east-southeasterly direction toward the epicenter. The quake also moved land masses in many areas ranging from the northeastern region of Tohoku to the Kanto region including Tokyo, the authority said. Search and rescue efforts have been hampered by snowfall in the hardest-hit areas, said spokesman Patrick Fuller of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""The cold is a real issue, particularly for the thousands of people in shelters, many of them elderly,"" he said, describing providing medical care as a ""massive challenge."" While efforts accelerated Saturday to restore power to cooling systems at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the focus shifted toward rebuilding in some parts of the country hardest hit by the temblor and the devastating wall of water that followed. ""We need to go forward,"" Rikuzentakata Mayor Futoshi Toba told construction workers, according to Kyodo News. Crews began building hundreds of temporary, prefabricated housing units in the coastal city, the agency said. A widely reported rescue Saturday offered a brief glimmer of hope amid headlines of death and destruction. But Japanese authorities later changed their story, saying a man rescued from the rubble of his home Saturday had actually been staying in a shelter. Originally, the Japanese Self-Defense Force reported that the man had been trapped for eight days. Meanwhile, the Tokyo Electric Power Co. said workers had laid extensive electrical cable near the Fukushima Daiichi power plant's No. 2 nuclear reactor -- a key step in an effort to restore power to the plant that authorities hope will keep temperatures low. That would curb the emission of radioactive material and, in a worst-case scenario, a full nuclear meltdown. Tokyo's fire department also began a new method of spraying water in and around the Fukushima Daiichi power plant's No. 3 reactor using an unmanned system that can spray sea water for up to seven hours at a time. In previous missions, firefighters, soldiers and power company workers had manually done the same in brief intervals to avoid prolonged radiation exposure. Tests revealed abnormally high levels of radiation that violate Japanese food safety laws in samples of spinach and milk from areas near the nuclear plant, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Saturday. Authorities are mulling regulating movement of agricultural products from the area, as well as collecting more data for analysis, Edano said. On Friday, authorities acknowledged that the situation at the troubled power plant was far more serious than they had originally estimated. Tokyo Electric's managing director, Akio Komiri, broke down in tears after leaving a news conference in Fukushima at which exposure levels were discussed. In a written statement, company president Masataka Shimizu said, ""we sincerely apologize ... for causing such a great concern and nuisance."" Even as the country's emergency agency raised its rating of the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant from a 4 to 5 -- putting it on par with the 1979 incident at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island -- Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan told his compatriots to bury their pessimism Friday. ""With a tsunami and earthquake we don't have any room to be pessimistic,"" he said. ""We are going to create Japan again from scratch. We should face this challenge together."" Kan acknowledged the situation at the Fukushima plant remains ""very grave"" and said his government has disclosed all that it knows to both the Japanese people and the international community. ""The police, fire department and self defense forces are all working together, putting their lives on the line, in an attempt to resolve the situation,"" he said. Meanwhile, the government raised the radiation exposure level for workers trying to avert a further crisis, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Saturday. Tokyo Electric said workers at the plant -- including company employees, members of the military and firefighters -- can now be exposed to 250 millisieverts of radiation before they must leave the area. An individual in a developed country is naturally exposed to about 3 millisieverts of radiation a year. The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends no more than 50 millisieverts exposure in a given year for nuclear rescue and recovery workers. It offers no restriction in a crisis when ""the benefit to others clearly outweighs the rescuer's risk."" Tokyo Electric has said it was doing all it can to protect workers' health. Japan's nuclear agency said Friday several hundred workers, including nonpower company employees, remained on site. In populated areas outside the nuclear facility, there have been few indications of any immediate, dangerous fall-out from the crisis so far. For the past eight days, weather patterns indicate that the wind has likely blown most emitted radiation out to sea. The British Embassy will run its last bus from Sendai to Tokyo on Sunday. As of Saturday, five of the embassy's free buses had transported 61 British nationals, 15 dependents and 31 persons of other nationalities over that route, according to Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. ""Based on demand, we do not plan to run any more coaches after Sunday,"" the office said in a statement. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report .","NEW: Death toll rises to 8,199 people .

"(CNN) -- At a shelter near Mexico City, Belkis Nunez is recovering. She's lying down on a bunk bed at the San Juan Diego Migrant House in Tultitlan, just north of the Mexican capital. The Honduran migrant says she's lucky to be alive: She was traveling on a cargo train in southern Mexico with other migrants when a group of armed men assaulted them. They were held at gunpoint and threatened. All were robbed and one of assailants held Nunez captive. Nunez, 23, says she had no option but to obey her captor's orders. He was demanding money. ""And then I told him, 'I'm not carrying any money, not at all. I'm with them.' And he asked me 'Which one of them is in charge of you?' 'No one; we're just all together.' And then he said 'OK, you women are always putting the money in your privates or in condoms,"" Nunez says. The group of Central American migrants was traveling on ""The Beast,"" a noisy, often-dangerous cargo train that rumbles through Mexico. It is used by migrants to reach the U.S. border. Mexican authorities say they're investigating the incident. Salvador Beltran del Rio, head of the Mexican Institute of Migration, says his agency is helping the migrants. ""Here in Mexico City we have 13 people. Twelve have said that they witnessed the incident,"" Beltran said. ""They have given their statements to the National Human Rights Commission first and then to the National Migration Institute."" In a separate incident, 50 Central American migrants who were apparently kidnapped in mid-December are still missing. The case was brought to the attention of authorities by Alejandro Solalinde, a Catholic priest who operates a shelter for traveling migrants in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca. Last summer, 72 migrants who were trying to reach the United States by traveling on the ground in Mexico were shot and killed in the border state of Tamaulipas. The migrants came from Central and South American countries including Honduras, El Salvador, Brazil and Ecuador, according to Alejandro Poire, Mexican national security spokesman. The victims had been tied by the hands. The ranch where they were found was only 100 miles away from the U.S.-Mexico border. An 18-year-old Ecuadorian national survived the massacre and notified authorities. The lead investigators in the case went missing shortly after the discovery of the migrants was made on August 24. The bodies of Jaime Suarez Vazquez and Juan Suarez Sanchez, deputy public investigator and secretary of public safety in San Fernando, Tamaulipas, were found in early September. Mexican investigators said at the time that Los Zetas, a Mexican drug cartel, might have been responsible for the massacre. The disappearances and killings of Central and South American migrants is creating tension between Mexico and the Latin American countries from which the migrants originate. The governments of Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are asking Mexico to thoroughly investigate disappearances, abuses and deaths of their citizens in Mexican territory. Mexican officials say they're doing everything in their power to protect the migrants. Back at the shelter, Nunez says this was the second time she had tried to reach the United States hidden in The Beast and she will probably try again. She has a very powerful reason: Her son is waiting for her in America. She says that's why she didn't think twice about risking her life along with the other Central American migrants.

"(CNN) -- At least 10 people being smuggled by boat died in the Gulf of Aden ""after a two-day journey from Somalia to Yemen,"" the United Nations' refugee agency said Tuesday. ""Ten Ethiopians suffocated en route to Yemen as the smugglers crammed and confined 25 people to the engine room with no ventilation,"" the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. ""Survivors claim that their bodies were thrown into the sea some seven hours after departure."" There were reports that another four people reportedly died in waves, the agency said. This reportedly happened as ""smugglers, fearing detection by the Yemeni navy, forced the remaining passengers to disembark too far from the coast. After the exhausting trip they were simply too tired to swim and succumbed to the rough sea."" The Horn of Africa has been wracked by warfare, famine and political instability, conditions that have spurred flight. More than 9,000 Somalis and 27,000 Ethiopians have arrived in Yemen by boat so far this year. Some of the passengers found on Yemen's shore near Al Hamra said the smuggler's boat left Bosaso in the Puntland region of northern Somalia on Sunday. There were 101 survivors. ""We condemn the unscrupulous and inhumane treatment of refugees and others who are desperately seeking to flee the violence, human rights abuses and seriously debilitating life options in the Horn of Africa,"" said Erika Feller, UNHCR's assistant high commissioner for protection. ""We have witnessed similar, isolated, individual incidents before utter disregard for human life.""

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Police raided a clinic in southeast Nigeria and rescued about 30 girls allegedly used in a ""baby industry"" in which they would give birth to children who then would be sold, authorities said Thursday. ""There are about 30 pregnant young ladies -- the eldest was 20 years old,"" said Geoffrey Ogbonna, a police spokesman. ""Some belong in secondary, even in primary school."" In addition to the expecting mothers, 12 children were found at the clinic ranging in age from 2 to 12 years old, according to Arinze Orakwue, a spokesman for the National Agency for the Prohibition of Traffic in Persons. It was not clear whether the children found were related to the pregnant girls and women. Orakwue called the operation of the clinic, which was officially registered, ""a failure of oversight."" Police stormed the Cross Foundation clinic in Abia state over the weekend after receiving a tip, but no babies were found at the location, the spokesman said. Authorities believe there were cases in which babies were sold for between 100,000 and 150,000 naira ($640 to $960), with the women receiving about $131, according to Ogbonna. Some of the women had unwanted pregnancies and wanted to get rid of their babies, while others were impregnated as part of the operation of the clinic's business, Orakwue said. A doctor arrested at the location said the babies had been handed over to social welfare for adoption. Police said the women seized were not cooperating. Only one of the women has talked so far, and she said her friend took her to the clinic, according to Ogbonna. ""They do not want to open up,"" he said. The investigation continues, police said.","Police raid a clinic in Abia state after a tip .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Fighting continued Wednesday into Thursday between government forces and tribesmen in Yemen's capital, as Sanaa residents reported hearing explosions near the presidential palace, a government source said. ""The reason the street fighting in Sanaa has gotten a lot more intense in the past several hours is because special forces are now involved,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the news media. ""The special forces of the Republican Guard, the elite units, got involved on Wednesday. They're being used because the government wants to minimize collateral damage and the special forces have particular training in clearing fighters from buildings."" Sanaa is, by most accounts, the most secure city in Yemen, which has a weak central government and contains vast stretches where tribal law reigns supreme. The intensity of the fighting in the capital, where most of Yemen's security forces and army units are based, has increased fears that the country is on the verge of civil war. The impoverished, arid and mountainous nation has been a key U.S. ally in the battle against the al Qaeda terrorist network. The government official expressed frustration that international mediation was no longer being attempted in Yemen. ""Where are the Gulf countries? Where are the mediators? Where are our international friends? Someone needs to step in. It seems like people are just kind of giving up and I'm not sure why. What's troubling is that this kind of fighting could go on for a long time in the country's capital."" The official expressed concern over looting of government buildings during electricity outages, with hundreds of computers and furniture being taken from ministry buildings. CNN was not able to verify the government source's report. Nor was it immediately able to reach a spokesman for the tribesmen. The fighting was occurring as residents of Sanaa reported early Thursday hearing heavy explosions, which had spread from the Hasaba district and were approaching the presidential palace, some eight kilometers (five miles) away. ""Strong explosions have been going on all night -- we've been hearing them for hours in many different areas of Sanaa,"" said one resident of the capital. ""The clashes are spreading and tonight have been much more intense than they have been the last few nights."" Yemen state television reported that an army general and a civilian were killed and 13 soldiers were wounded in clashes with supporters of the al-Ahmar family. They are members of the powerful Hashed tribe who rose up last month against President Ali Abdullah Saleh after the longtime leader backed out of a regionally brokered deal meant to ease him out of office and end months of demonstrations. ""The excessive use of force all day and night by the two fighting parties, the Army and the Al-Ahmar tribe, on many residential areas of Sanaa is causing great human and capital loss,"" said Amal Basha, a rights activist in Sanaa. State television, citing a security source, said al-Ahmar supporters were bombing governrment installations and institutions in the Sanaa neighborhood of Hasba. Ibrahim Mothana told CNN he was hiding in his house near the palace after hearing continuous machine-gun firing. Journalist Raja Althaibani said residents in her Sanaa neighborhood were carrying weapons and the explosions were intensifying. ""It isn't even because the explosions are loud, it's that they sound heavy and powerful -- giant thuds!"" she said. ""I can feel it in my bones."" Information was difficult to get out of the country, which has blocked access by CNN journalists. Thursday's unrest came more than a day after four missiles struck a compound where generals who had defected from the Yemeni regime were meeting, a spokesman for the defected generals said Wednesday. The spokesman, Askar Zuail, said there were no casualties as a result of the Tuesday night assault, which he blamed on Saleh's regime. But government spokesman Abdu Ganady on Tuesday denied the claim to Al Jazeera. A senior defense ministry official who did not want to be named for security reasons also denied the claim to CNN. The defected generals are running Sanaa's largest military base. Despite such cracks in Saleh's regime, the deadly unrest rages on. Fierce clashes erupted Wednesday between government security forces and Hashed tribesmen in front of the Ministry of Local Administration in Sanaa, witnesses said. The Hashed tribe has opposed government forces in intermittent fighting for more than a month. Fifteen tribesmen were killed and 31 wounded in clashes on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Abdul Qawi Qaisi, spokesman for the head of the Hashed tribe. On Tuesday, clashes between Yemeni security forces and tribal groups left at least five tribesmen dead while a leading tribe seized more government buildings in Sanaa, according to a spokesman for the leader of the Hashed faction. In the southern city of Taiz, a center of protests against Saleh, three people were killed and at least 26 were wounded by gunfire on Tuesday, said Yasser Nomeree, a hospital staffer, and Bushra Maktari, a youth leader. The Organizing Committee of the Youth Revolution said members of the Yemen Army's Republican Guards shot at demonstrators in downtown Taiz. In a written statement Tuesday, the United Nations said at least 100 people had been arrested in Taiz, while hundreds more had been wounded nationwide in recent fighting, according to a U.N. statement Tuesday. ""Saleh does not want peace,"" said the spokesman for the head of the Hashed tribe. ""Saleh thrives with blood being spilt. They attacked us and we had to defend."" Government spokesman Tarek Shami said mediation efforts meant to stem the violence between the country's tribal groups and Saleh's government ended Saturday without a peace accord because Hashed tribesmen would not negotiate. ""They occupy ministries and police stations. They walk armed in the streets of Sanaa. They spread fear amongst the people,"" Shami said. ""The tribes are attacking homes of civilians; that is why the cease-fire cannot continue."" Catherine Ashton, foreign policy chief of the European Union, denounced the attacks in Taiz. ""I am shocked and condemn in the strongest terms the use of force and live ammunition against peaceful protesters in the city of Taiz,"" Ashton said in a statement Tuesday. ""The continued repression by the Yemeni regime and grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law cannot be accepted."" The U.S. Embassy in Sanaa has condemned what it called the ""unprovoked and unjustified attack"" on demonstrators in Taiz. It praised the protesters and called on Saleh ""to move immediately on his commitment to transfer power.""

"(CNN) -- Guatemalan authorities arrested an alleged drug lord wanted by both Guatemala and the United States for aiding the transit of cocaine for a Mexican drug cartel, officials said. Waldemar Lorenzana Lima, described as one of the most wanted in the United States, was captured Tuesday by Guatemalan National Police in the central town of Jicaro, Attorney General Claudia Paz said. Lorenzana and his three sons were labeled ""Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers"" by the U.S. Treasury Department last year, a distinction that froze any U.S. assets and prohibits anyone from doing financial transactions with them. The Lorenzanas played a key role in moving cocaine between Colombia and Mexico, and ultimately, the United States, according to the Treasury Department. Lorenzana used Guatemala as a trans-shipment point for the drugs from Colombia, and he would then transfer them to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, which would take the contraband north. The U.S. government was offering a reward of up to $500,000 for information regarding Lorenzana. ""This arrest shows that no one is above the law,"" Guatemalan Interior Minister Carlos Menocal said, the state-run AGN news agency reported.

"(CNN) -- The wide avenues of Havana became a colorful mosaic of the faces and flags of throngs of Cuban people -- 600,000 of them, according to state media -- as people gathered to commemorate International Workers' Day, or May Day, on Sunday. But with the recent announcement of possibly sweeping, dramatic changes to Cuba's economic system, and the difficulties international media face in speaking to Cubans, it is difficult to know with certainty what the mood on those streets is. Two days ago, Cuba's state-run Granma predicted that today's parade would be a ""brilliant culmination of the popular mass participation of workers and people in the open and democratic process of discussion"" that yielded the recent announcement of economic changes following the Sixth Party Congress of mid-April. But if mood and turnout at the parade were predictable, it was precisely because ""Cuban workers are told by the government to march on May 1, and then afterwards, the Cuban government decides what the people were marching for,"" said Tomas Bilbao, executive director of the online Cuba Study Group, a site dedicated to the opening and reform of Cuba's society and economy. Bilbao says similar turnouts in previous years have officially been attributed to other reasons. But given compulsory attendance and the lack of full, transparent information among Cuban people, he finds efforts to attribute large turnouts to people's strong political feelings misleading. An end to those classic cars in Cuba? Less than two weeks ago, Cuba's Communist Party held its Sixth Party Congress -- its first in 14 years -- and announced that it had approved drastic changes, including term limits for its top leaders, the gradual elimination of the ration card system, the purchase and sale of housing and cars, and massive layoffs, which the president has said will exceed one million. Among average Cubans, neither the timetable of implementation nor the final details of these changes are known. It is not even clear if they will be formally announced at some future time. This leads to a cautious, if optimistic, uncertainty, Bilbao said. ""There is a lot of anticipation because people are in a desperate situation. But a lot of the fear is from people who will lose state jobs, or people concerned with losing elements of the ration system, especially older people. People are curious ... because in the past, these types of reforms have been rolled back."" ""Plans are still to lay off 500,000 workers in the next few months, and one has to wonder how many of those who attended (the May Day commemorations) are doing so in the hope of avoiding that fate,"" said Eusebio Mujal-Leon, director of the Cuba XXI Project at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Bilbao says the timing of the Sixth Party Congress is indicative of a lack of party confidence: By preceding the Congress with the 50th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs invasion, and following the Congress with May Day marches, the party maximized nationalist sentiment and the appearance of massive popular support. And as to why the Congress would happen this year, as opposed to previous years, Bilbao said the desire for change has simply grown too strong. ""It's no longer taboo in Cuba to recognize that the system has failed. (President) Raul Castro has encouraged people to debate what measures should be taken,"" Bilbao said of the possibilities of real reform. ""More importantly,"" he added, ""there is no alternative.""","Official Cuban media: 600,000 people from Havana gathered at the capital's Revolution Square .
Activists say dire economic conditions in Cuba have necessitated structural change .

"(CNN) -- The president of the Ivory Coast is urging the International Criminal Court to investigate major crimes committed in his country after a disputed November election sparked a political standoff that left hundreds dead. In a letter posted on the court's website Wednesday, President Alassane Ouattara asked for an ""independent and impartial investigations into the most serious crimes committed"" after the presidential poll. Ouattara has been in power since the April arrest of incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo, who defied international calls to step down after he lost the election. Hundreds died in the ensuing standoff, according to rights groups. Human rights investigators said this month that they have found a total of 10 mass graves near the commercial capital of Abidjan. Human Rights Watch has said forces loyal to both leaders killed or raped citizens, burned homes and kidnapped civilians during the standoff. The president asked the international court to ensure those with the ""greatest criminal responsibility"" for the crimes are brought to justice. He made the request in a letter to Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo this month, the court said.

On Monday, the criminal court sought the arrest of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and two relatives, linking them to ""widespread and systematic"" attacks on civilians as they struggle to hold power in the North African nation.

"(CNN) -- A Palestinian radical group believed to be responsible for a series of abductions and attacks has been labeled a foreign terrorist organization by the United States. Known as the Army of Islam, the group ""has been responsible for numerous terrorist acts against the governments of Israel and Egypt, as well as American, British and New Zealander citizens,"" the State Department said. ""These actions include a number of rocket attacks on Israel, the 2006 kidnapping of two Fox News journalists in Gaza (an American and a New Zealander) and the 2007 kidnapping of a British citizen, journalist Alan Johnston, in Gaza. The group is also responsible for early 2009 attacks on Egyptian civilians in Cairo and Heliopolis, which resulted in casualties and deaths,"" the State Department said. While the statement doesn't make reference to the abduction five years ago of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, Palestinian security sources have said the group was involved in Shalit's capture, along with Hamas and another entity. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued the designation on Thursday. It is the latest of many such moves against militant groups over the years. The designation would result in a prohibition against Americans ""providing material support or resources"" to the group. It also includes the ""freezing of all property and interests in property of the organization that are in the United States, or come within the United States, or the control of U.S. persons."" The group is led by Mumtaz Dughmush and ""operates primarily in the Gaza Strip and Palestinian territories,"" the State Department said. The International Crisis Group said Dughmush is a former member of the Palestinian Authority's ""Preventive Security Organization who for years allegedly had been contracted for militant operations by both Hamas and Fatah."" Hamas runs the Palestinian territory of Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, which is dominated by the Fatah group, is in charge of the West Bank, the other Palestinian region. Both groups, which have been adversaries for years, are working to reconcile their movements. Hamas opposes the existence of Israel but Fatah is not as hard-line and has been involved in peace talks with Israel. The State Department says the Army of Islam ""subscribes to a Salafist ideology of global jihad together with the traditional model of armed Palestinian resistance. AOI has previously worked with Hamas and is attempting to develop closer al Qaeda contacts. On May 7 the group released a eulogy for Osama bin Laden via its Al Nur Media Foundation,"" ""Salafis are Sunni Muslims who adhere to a literalist reading of scripture,"" according to an International Crisis Group report in March called ""Radical Islam in Gaza."" The Army of Islam's designation comes after President Barack Obama delivered a speech on Thursday detailing his Middle East policy, which includes attempts to reinvigorate the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In the speech, Obama said the pre-1967 borders of Israel should serve as the basis for negotiations in the formation of a future Palestinian state. He said there could be ""mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states."" Obama will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday at the White House in a session that could highlight the tensions between the allies.

"(CNN) -- The body-checking incident that left a National Hockey League player with a concussion and fractured vertebrae has not only some fans concerned but also at least one corporate sponsor -- Air Canada fired off an open letter to NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, threatening to yank its sponsorship of the league. The letter, sent last Wednesday by Denis Vanda, director of marketing communication for the airline, expressed Air Canada's concern about recent violent checks. The letter said unless the league ""takes immediate action with serious suspension to players to curtail these life-threatening injuries, Air Canada will withdraw its sponsorship of hockey."" Boston Bruins' Zdeno Chara slammed Montreal Canadiens' Max Pacioretty during last Tuesday's game, causing Pacioretty to fall to the ice. Pacioretty was taken from the ice on a stretcher and currently he is in a hospital. He is out indefinitely, according to Canadiens' coach Jacques Martin. Chara received game penalties, but no fine or suspension. The NHL said it stands by its ruling that no suspension is warranted. Veteran sportscaster Len Berman told CNN the controversy may not be over. ""The commissioner has already said it's not going to affect anything, but I have to guarantee you that if sponsors stepped up and said, 'Hey we're going to be pulling out' that the NHL is going to listen."" The NHL's annual general managers meeting began Monday with attendees looking at the effects of the leagues' Rule 48, put into effect this season and banning purposeful checking of players' heads and from their blindsides, according to NHL.com. During the meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, the NHL released data showing there has been a decrease in the incidences of concussions during the League's 2010-11 season. NHL.com says the data shows one blindside hit that has caused concussion this season, compared to four from the previous season. For a lot of hockey fans, fights and hard hits are part of the lure of the game. Berman says fans enjoy watching the fights, ""Next time you see a hockey fight, look at all the fans right behind the fight. They all have big smiles on their faces. You never hear booing at a hockey fight. You only hear cheering. "" Chara says the hit on Pacioretty wasn't intentional and he meant no harm. Yet, days later, Chara -- not known for dirty plays -- is still hearing booing from fans. ""It doesn't bother me. It's just a part of the game. The fans are...they have the right to express their opinion....towards different players."" Chara told CNN. But do the sponsors have that right? One player sees it both ways. Andrew McDonald, a New york Islanders' defenseman, said, ""I can see their concern. They're obviously worried about player safety...I think as players, we appreciate that. But again, as players, we know what we're going into when we go into a hockey game.""

"(CNN) -- The author of the Sookie Stackhouse series of supernatural thrillers and inspiration for HBO's popular drama ""True Blood,"" Charlaine Harris, is putting her eye for suspense toward an equally arresting subject: Video games. Produced for iPlay, the fruit of her labor, downloadable PC puzzler ""Dying for Daylight,"" features an original tale starring Dahlia, a wisecracking, fashion-forward vampire hunting for a potion that lets vampires survive in sunlight. A hidden-object game designed for casual play by both women and men, it aims to bridge the gap between paperback readers and gaming fans, leveraging Harris' gift for crafting clever characters and scenarios. Now that she has contributed to one of a growing range of collaborations between the gaming and publishing industries, we asked Harris why critics haven't written the final word on interactive entertainment's potential to craft compelling narratives yet. CNN: How do video games compare to books and TV as a storytelling medium? Harris: Video games are visual like TV, but involve a certain amount of comprehension that TV often doesn't. It's a refreshing change from both books and TV, I find. CNN: What key differences are involved in writing for passive and interactive formats, e.g. novels vs. games? Harris: For me, writing books is about the progression of the characters as they change to meet circumstances on their way to the climax of the book. Games seem to have a more clearly cut goal and to require little change on the part of the character you're maneuvering through the stages of the game. Since I have discovered I'm really linear, the one step forward, one step back structure of games was at first very frustrating; you don't keep going forward but are having to go back to get this item or that item. Perhaps it's more like real life in that respect! CNN: Many authors, such as Stephen King, Harlan Ellison, Michael Crichton and James Patterson have dabbled with gaming in the past. Will we see more embracing the format going forward? Harris: I'm sure more will, simply because it's another way to publicize your books, after all. And it's a fresh and fun market for many writers; the chance to do something different is always interesting. CNN: Digital seems to be the watchword for authors these days. Do you believe games and interactive fiction, like Kindle Singles, eBooks and other virtual platforms, may someday reinvent publishing? Harris: I'm certain digital will permanently alter the publishing industry. I hope that books will not completely go by the wayside, but I fear they will. I love to hold a book in my hands, but I can't deny it's much more convenient and green to have all my books on one device and to be able to take that device with me when I travel, instead of bulky and heavy books. For that time alone, eBooks are worth it. And the same thinking applies to all the other uses. Portable is the way the world is going. CNN: Knowing this, are games becoming a better medium both artistically and commercially than typical channels such as books, essays and short stories for writers to make their mark? Harris: No, not yet. Short stories put your name in the path of the reading public, and therefore publishers. Publishers will take you much more seriously if you've had several short stories in reputable markets like magazines or anthologies. I don't know how much credence they'd put in a book proposal by a writer who'd written games, but I'm willing to believe that is mounting. I think any way you can get published is good though, as long as you're getting paid for it. I don't know if games have the power to create a career, but they certainly could add to one. CNN: What do titles like ""Dying for Daylight"" allow you to do that you could never accomplish with print media? Harris: I'm hoping that people who enjoy playing the game will decide to read my books, naturally. This is a chance to reach out to a whole new audience. Also, it's simply fun for me. CNN: How do you foresee the worlds of literature and gaming continuing to collide in the future? Harris: I'm sure that mystery, with its defined structure and clear goal, is a great genre for gaming. Science fiction, with its ""quest"" structure, also adapts well. I think more and more of the big names in those genres will come to the adventure of gaming with good ideas and I look forward to seeing that.","""Video games are visual like TV,"" author says .

"(CNN) -- Sir Philip Green is the retail king of Great Britain, but can his empire of clothing stores conquer the U.S.? The launch of his flagship Topshop store in New York was delayed and coincided with the height of recession two years ago, but the self-made billionaire still believes he can crack America. ""There's nothing I have seen that tells me we can't get this brand to work in America,"" says Green. Green's Arcadia Group has over 2,500 outlets in the UK, including affordable fashion chain, Topshop, and employs over 44,000 staff. His transformation of Topshop from cheap high street shop to a fashion-forward brand has grabbed the attention of supermodels, fashionistas and the queen of fashion, U.S. Vogue editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour. A good combination to grow a brand in the U.S. ""Philip has a larger than life personality... (He) has been very successful in attracting attention for Topshop,"" says Wintour. ""Asking Kate Moss to design a collection that really put the spotlight on Topshop in a way that hadn't before, so that was a very smart move."" The supermodel is no-longer connected to the brand, but the New York store has weathered the recession and built up the brand despite some misgivings from Green himself. ""Being honest, would I rather be a hundred meters further north in Broadway? Yes, I would,"" he says. ""Is it the furthest south a retailer has taken on that's never traded in America? Did we take a site that was horrid, did it have risk in terms of where it is, how far down SoHo it is, getting people to come down there?"" They may be rhetorical questions, but despite the calculated risks Green and his Arcadia Group remains an emerging player in the U.S. retail scene where so many British companies have tried and failed before: a common joke in the rag-trade says that the only way to make a small fortune in America is start with a large fortune. ""It is a bit of a gamble because it's such a sophisticated market, but the risks are worth the rewards,"" says Isabel Cavill from Planet Retail. ""The U.S. is still the largest retail market in the world."" Cavill cites the lack of brand awareness, too rapid expansion and badly thought out partnerships with U.S. chains as typical reasons why British and other foreign brands have failed to make much of a dent in the U.S. Last year profits of Arcadia Group were more than healthy -- around $440 million in 2010 -- but faced with the U.S. market, ""we are a pimple in terms of one brand, in terms of scale, of what the size of the opportunity could be,"" Green says. ""Naturally if we want to build a global business, we have got to develop so I think from an investment strategy, from size of the marketplace, from what I think we need to do with the brand, (we need) to move the needle as they say."" Doubling the size of Topshop sounds a big ask, he says, but ""there's good acceptance of the product, there's good acceptance of the brand, there's work to do but I think we've got a shot."" Opening new stores in other big cosmopolitan cities in the U.S. is the immediate plan; one that Wintour believes would be successful. ""The American retail market is different from the British one,"" she says. ""Philip doesn't take unnecessary risk but with everything being so positive in the States and the economy picking up, I'm really hopeful that he'll expand across the country. ""America is a more casual country (than the UK). You go outside of the more fashionable cities you tend to see a lot of jeans and sweatshirts, it's less responsive to what Topshop stands for. ""I'm confident that with Philip's expertise he will conquer the United States the way that he has conquered Britain.""","British retail billionaire Sir Philip Green aims to make his fashion brand big in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey school employee is under fire for enlisting an impersonator to fill in for Lady Gaga, who was slated to talk to elementary school students about the dangers of bullying, school officials said. Tenafly Public Schools administrators were alerted of the gaffe by one school-aged Lady Gaga fan who wasn't fooled by a phony autographed photo of the pop star, superintendent Lynn Trager said. ""We are all disappointed and surprised,"" said Trager, who outlined the details of the May 25 stunt in a letter sent to elementary school parents in the district last week. According to the letter, the staff member who arranged for Lady Gaga to give an anti-bullying presentation to students via Skype claimed to have a personal relationship with the singer. But in the 11th hour, Lady Gaga backed out. ""Knowing how disappointed the children would be, without authorization the staff developer made arrangements for an impersonator to take Lady Gaga's place -- a clear lapse in judgment,"" the letter said. During the presentation, the impersonator claimed her microphone wasn't working and typed to students instead of speaking, Trager said. School officials were tipped off to the incident by a skeptical student who wasn't convinced by the autographed photo of Lady Gaga that was distributed to students during the presentation. ""It was a student who discovered that the handwriting didn't look real to her,"" Trager said of how administrators were informed of the scam. The district immediately informed parents and suspended all future Skype guests. ""As soon as we discovered this we felt we owed it to the parents and students to be honest,"" Trager added. She would not comment on what actions, if any, are being taken against the school employee behind the Lady Gaga-swapping caper. In the letter to parents, Trager said she does not believe the employee intended to be malicious. ""Although her actions were inexcusable, I do believe that this was a misguided attempt to reward the children for their diligent preparation for the NJ ASK test,"" the letter reads, referring to a state standardized test, the New Jersey Assessment of Skills and Knowledge.","Elementary school worker claimed she could get celebrity to speak .

"(CNN)  -- Last week, video game blogs lit up with excitement over a game that was previously on no one's radar. The zombie survival horror game ""Dead Island,"" doesn't have a release date yet, but it's got a remarkable, haunting trailer, one so skillfully made that it's prompted some bloggers to call it the best game trailer ever released. Told in reverse, presented in slow-motion, it's a stunning piece of work. A chase, intercut into the scene, fills in the backstory and by the end, the two pieces of virtual film merge. So what happens in the trailer? A little girl dies. Horrifically. She's chased down a hallway by zombies, bitten into, then temporarily rescued by her parents. Moments later, she becomes a zombie herself. She attacks her father and as he turns in pain, she's flung through a window and falls many stories to her death. In presenting the story in reverse, the trailer begins with her body lying broken on the ground, her eye open and staring. Effective? Absolutely. In less than a day, a game that sounded like a by-the-numbers zombie shooter had a built-in audience of worshipful players ready to buy ""Dead Island"" whenever it ships. Deep Silver, the game's developer, said there's been strong interest in a movie adaptation for a game that nobody's yet played. As a gamer and as a parent of two little girls, I can say that as much as I admire the craft of putting such a game trailer together, it's not one that I can enjoy. The game itself may turn out to be fantastic, but the cinematic preview strikes me as exploitative and cynical, a successful marketing ploy meant to evoke shock and pity. The ""Dead Island"" trailer wouldn't bother me so much if it didn't feel like part of a growing, disturbing trend in video games. Last year, I played ""Heavy Rain,"" a dark, story-driven melodrama about a serial killer who drowns young boys. In the game, you play as four main characters trying to stop the crimes, including the father of a boy who's been kidnapped by the murderer. [SPOILER ALERT] It's only in the last act of the game that you discover one of those characters is the killer and at points in the game you were unwittingly helping the serial killer along. The 2007 hit ""BioShock"" introduced players to the Little Sisters, mutant children you could save or harvest for power-ups that would help you in the game. Players literally held the lives of the little girls in their hands and had to decide whether to kill. And in a game I'm currently playing, ""Dead Space 2,"" some of the enemies you mow down with futuristic weapons include small, quick moving ""Necromorphs"" that resemble fierce little Gollums. The disgusting space mutants, it turns out, were once children living on a large space station. To guide the point home, you're tasked with exploring a day care center where they used to play. These are all games I've played and enjoyed; ""BioShock"" was considered one of the best games of 2007. ""Heavy Rain"" was well-regarded for its uncompromising storytelling and adult themes. And ""Dead Space 2"" has earned raves from game critics for its unrelenting action and scares. But, increasingly, I'm getting uncomfortable with how comfortable game developers have become with putting children in peril and, often, allowing them to be gruesomely killed. If you watch local TV news, read the newspaper or skim through CNN's headlines, there's not a day that goes by when you don't hear about some unthinkable violence or long-term abuse against a child. The video game industry, which has strived since the 1980s to have the same cultural cachet as TV and movies, has found a taboo that can make gamers feel like they're consuming more mature, provocative entertainment. When such depictions are presented in an artful, entertaining way, video game advocates are put in a position of defending content that might be less palatable in other mediums. Would the ""Dead Island"" trailer work as a live-action preview of a movie or would it have provoked outrage? I wonder if our tolerance for virtual gore and bloodshed in games has numbed us to the mutilation and torture of children because they're virtual characters, no more real than the barrel-chested Nazis in ""Wolfenstein 3D"" or the turtles in ""Super Mario Bros."" Or, more disturbingly, maybe we've become so used to hearing about violence directed at kids that its depiction in video games is just another reflection of our culture. Perhaps developers, many of whom have kids of their own, are exploring their own fears as they build complex, dark game narratives, fully aware that once there's an ""M for Mature"" label on the package, there'll be little outcry. Perhaps there are some people who like the queasy feeling of taking down kid-sized zombies and space monsters in their video game entertainment. If that's the case, then the ""Dead Island"" trailer has done its job. It's horrified me and has left me feeling haunted and sad. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Omar L. Gallaga.","The trailer for zombie survival horror game ""Dead Island"" has sparked intense interest online .

"(CNN) -- ""Killzone 3,"" in stores this week, is one wild, rolling firefight. Set across many different terrains, it challenges players to show off their mental capabilities as well as their shooting prowess. The first-person shooter (Sony, Guerrilla Games) picks up where ""Killzone 2"" left off, with the opposition leader dead and a city in ruins after a nuclear bomb goes off. The gameplay quickly becomes run-and-gun, as players race to get out of a war zone where they are vastly outnumbered. The Helghast, sort of a futuristic pseudo-Nazi/Cold War Russian looking group, are on the trail of our intrepid heroes through a nuked-out city, leafy jungle, polar mountains and outer space. Each setting presented its own challenges and really varied the tactics needed to survive. Guerrilla Games producer Kyle Shubel said the team spent the two years in production listening to fans about what they liked and didn't like from the series. He said the gaming engine -- the software system that runs the game -- remained the same as ""Killzone 2,"" but that this time developers had the time to do more with it. ""The fans requested so many things,"" he said. ""But being given time to respond has been a strength. We really wanted to squeeze more out of the engine and we think we've done it."" The environments play a big role in gameplay, as buildings and roads crumble under the weight of armored vehicles in the city or darkened areas hide players from enemy eyes as they sneak through the jungle. All are well rendered and help get players immersed in the action. The jungle missions were probably the most fun and the most mentally challenging. Players are forced to get stealthy -- and when I say forced, I mean it. The bad guys are so overwhelming that when I got spotted, there was no chance of survival despite being well-armed. However, the slow, methodical movements were a nice change of pace from running from building to building for survival. The boss battle with the towering MAWLR, a mechanical walker that could only be slowed down by shooting its exhaust ports (Death Star, anyone?), was as frantic and bombastic as the jungle was slow. Attacks are needed from the ground and from the air to stop this beast and don't let your guard down for a second. The polar mission and the outer space mission showed off some of the vehicles you'll get to use. I thought the ice-saw cycle in the snow regions was not as much fun as it could have been. Piloting space fighters to take out battle cruisers wasn't new, but it was exciting to play. Jet packs helped hopscotch around the battlefield and reach places that couldn't normally be reached. The EXO walker (think ""Aliens"") was bulky and hard to manage, but offered a big punch when needed. Shubel said each environment was designed to have its own style of play and its own set of missions. He explained that emerging technology allowed them to ramp up the look of ""Killzone 3"" from its predecessors. ""We learned a lot and worked on leveraging new technology. It allows us to do a lot of cinematic tricks that Hollywood does in blockbuster movies."" There are plenty of cut scenes to help round out the story and move it along. The Helghast leaders, voiced by Malcolm McDowell and Ray Winstone, are brutal and methodical in their destruction of the Interplanetary Strategic Alliance. The interaction between the two leaders builds to a resounding, if perhaps expected, crescendo. Single player action took about 7 hours for me, but Shubel said 8 to 10 hours was normal for completion. Split-screen co-op for two players is also available for offline play. Online, there are three game modes that can support up to 24 players for some of the missions. Five different classes are available: Marksman, Engineer, Medic, Tactician and Infiltrator. Each can earn points during the matches to improve their abilities and weapons. The Infiltrator and Marksman were the most interesting to play. The Infiltrator can disguise himself as a friendly trooper until right before he slits your throat. The Marksman is a sniper who can remain nearly invisible until an attack is made. Shubel said the development team spent a lot of time working on balancing out the power for each class so no one has an overwhelming ability to tip the scales in the fight. It does take team work from different types of players to be successful in the multiplayer modes. The game also can be viewed in 3-D. During a demonstration in Washington, I got to play using 3-D technology and a new peripheral (a gun-shaped controller) called the Sharp Shooter. The 3-D aspects didn't really benefit gameplay, but they did make the game graphics a little bit better. The Sharp Shooter, an attachment to the Sony Move controller, ended up being a lot more fun than I expected. Ultimately, I would prefer to play with the Sixaxis controller. However, I could easily see the game being played by a new person with the Sharp Shooter for more enjoyment than a regular controller. ""Killzone 3"" isn't going to blow the doors off other first-person shooter games, but it does offer a variety of missions, scenarios, and skills that make run-and-gun gaming enjoyable. There were very few disappointments and the multiplayer action was just as exciting as the single-player. And, of course, there was a cliffhanger ending so be prepared for a ""Killzone 4"" in a couple of years. ""Killzone 3"" is a PlayStation 3 exclusive title. It is rated M for mature audiences due to blood and gore, intense violence and strong language. This review was done on the PS3 using the Sixaxis controller for single player and the Move controller for multiplayer.","The first-person shooter picks up where ""Killzone 2"" left off .

"Beijing (CNN) -- She ate her favorite food all day long and rarely exercised. She had a few brief failed relationships but mostly stayed single and never gave birth. Defying conventional wisdom on a healthy lifestyle, she somehow found the secret to longevity. When she died of kidney failure on May 7 in southern China, some local media called Ming Ming, 34, the world's oldest giant panda, generating global headlines. Wild pandas live 15 years on average, while those in captivity can live much longer thanks to improved nutrition and medical care, according to WWF, the nature conservation organization whose logo famously features a giant panda. CNN anchor's surprising views on pandas . At least two pandas had lived longer than Ming Ming, state media has reported. Tao Tao died in 2008 at the age of 36 and Chang Chang passed away in 2002 at the age of 35. ""The longevity of those pandas doesn't have too much to do with our conservation effort,"" said Professor Fan Zhiyong, head of the species program at WWF's Beijing office. ""In captivity pandas don't have to worry about food sources, infectious diseases and competition from other species -- all of which remain challenges to their survival in the wild."" While both Tao Tao and Chang Chang spent most of their lives in a zoo in eastern China, Ming Ming's life journey spanned half the globe. Her longevity had surpassed most people's expectations. She was rescued in 1979 in the mountains of Sichuan province, a rare sanctuary for one of the world's most endangered species. Some 300 pandas live in captivity in China, mostly in breeding programs aimed at boosting the low population caused by disappearing natural habitats and low fertility rate. Fewer than a dozen zoos outside China have pandas. ""Ming Ming had always been weak ever since she was rescued,"" said Huang Zhi, one of her caretakers at China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, also in Sichuan, where she grew up. ""She was quite timid and not very close to people,"" he added. Despite the personality, Ming Ming played the panda ambassador when the Chinese government dispatched her to the London Zoo in 1991. Fighting instead of mating with a male panda from Berlin, Ming Ming failed her most important duty and returned home three years later. She moved one last time in 1998 to a safari park in the southern Guangdong province, where old age eventually caused multiple health problems. Huang, Ming Ming's longtime caretaker, last visited her in April. ""Her eyesight was deteriorating -- and she moved very slowly and ate very little,"" he recalled.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration announced Friday that it had shuffled some key management jobs as it continues its review of the controversy over sleeping and inattentive controllers. It also named four members to a review panel that will evaluate the FAA's controller training programs to make sure new controllers are properly prepared. The panel will submit a report to FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt this fall. ""We are continuing to do everything in our power to ensure that our nation's aviation system remains the safest in the world,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. He called the changes ""just the beginning of the process."" The controversy, which grew in recent weeks to include more than a half-dozen alleged sleeping or inattentive controllers, had already claimed a top FAA official, Henry ""Hank"" Krakowski, who resigned his post as head of the FAA's Air Traffic Organization. It has also fired three air traffic controllers in Miami, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Seattle who were found to have slept on the job, and is continuing its review of other controllers. In the changes announced Friday, the FAA said it is repositioning three veteran FAA managers to critical roles. Walt Cochran will oversee terminal operations, where he will be responsible for FAA airport towers and regional radar facilities. Chris Metts will oversee all of the FAA's ""en route"" and oceanic operations. Glen Martin will become air traffic manager at the Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center. The FAA said it also is assessing key mid-level management positions ""to ensure that both technical and leadership expectations are being met."" The members of the independent review panel are: Michael Barr, University of Southern California Aviation, Safety & Security program; Tim Brady, Embry Riddle Aeronautical University; Garth Koleszar, National Air Traffic Controllers Association; Michael New, United Airlines; and Julia Pounds, FAA. Earlier this month, the FAA changed work schedules to allow controllers more time off between shifts, and Babbitt and controller union president Paul Rinaldi toured facilities to send a message to controllers about job expectations.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- CNN photojournalist Khalil Abdallah was having breakfast Saturday in a Tripoli hotel that houses foreign press when a woman burst into the restaurant, screaming that she had been raped and beaten for days by Moammar Gadhafi's brigades. Her sudden entrance startled the group of international journalists, who were about to begin another day covering the crisis in Libya. The woman's face was heavily bruised, a long bruise running down the left side of her cheek. She walked around, sobbing, shouting, lifting her dress to show a bloody thigh. Her ankles and wrists were bloody where she said she had been bound. One of the few present who spoke Arabic, the photojournalist understood her pleas. ""She was saying, 'We are all Libyans! Why don't you treat us the same?' "" Abdallah recounted Sunday for CNN.com. The woman told the journalists that she had been picked up at a government checkpoint east of Tripoli, tied, beaten and raped for two days. Her name was Eman al-Obeidy, she said. ""Look at what Gadhafi's brigades did to me!"" she screamed. ""My honor was violated by them!"" Reporters gathered around her, trying to calm her, Abdallah recalled. He and other photojournalists dashed for their cameras. ""We were all in shock,"" Abdallah said, trying to keep a steady hand. He knew that minders -- the men Libya's government assigns to foreign journalists to monitor their every move -- were nearby. Reporters had barely asked a few questions before those minders were on them, pushing and shoving reporters to the side, trying to jerk the woman away. Some of them were wearing their distinctive red badges, Abdallah said, while others were in plain clothes. They threw punches. Journalists tried to defend themselves and keep the woman away from the minders. ""It was like a rugby pileup,"" Abdallah said. A correspondent for Britain's Channel 4, Jonathan Miller, tried to push one of the minders back. The woman was trying to fight back as well, Abdallah said. ""She is pushing him (a minder) back saying, 'Don't touch me, leave me alone!' "" he said. ""From that point on, everybody in this hotel was against us (the journalists),"" the photojournalist recounted. Minders ran after journalists, jumping on them, beating them, he said. At one point a bag was placed over the woman's head and she was led out to the hotel garden. She was questioned for about 40 minutes, and then minders came back inside. They announced that the woman was crazy and that she was being taken to the hospital. ""All the minders were telling us she was drunk or had mental problems,"" Abdallah said. A short while later, the woman was led through the lobby. Journalists followed, protesting, shouting for the men to let her go. A journalist can be heard on video asking her: ""Are you OK?"" ""No,"" the woman answers, her voice shaky. She yells into a camera: ""If you don't see me tomorrow, then that's it!"" The woman is forced into a waiting car. She shouts that she is being taken to jail. The minders told reporters that they could see the woman again, later. ""We have been told that we'd see people again, but we never do,"" said Abdallah. An image he captured shows a minder pointing his finger at Abdallah just before snatching his camera and breaking it. ""He ripped the microphone off, the viewfinder, his nails sunk into my arm,"" said Abdallah. ""I was pulling the camera one way; he was pulling it the other way."" While wrestling for his camera, Abdallah saw a minder standing nearby holding a 9 mm handgun. The photojournalist let go and slowly began to back out of the restaurant. Then Abdallah heard something from the minders that he has come to expect, but that never fails to sting him. ""'He is Arab!' they were shouting. 'Why is he doing this to us?'"" ""Once you're labeled like that, it doesn't matter what your citizenship is,"" he said. ""But what I felt more was terrible for this woman and how the government is going to deal with her. ""That is the thing that is most disturbing.""  Postscript: . The Libyan woman who stormed into the Tripoli hotel Saturday to tell foreign reporters that government troops raped her has been released, government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim told reporters at a news conference Sunday. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the spokesman's announcement.","CNN journalist sees woman burst into hotel saying Gadhafi supporters raped, beat her .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Embassy in Beijing said Friday it was ""extremely disappointed"" by a Chinese court decision to uphold the eight-year prison sentence of American citizen Xue Feng. ""I am extremely disappointed in the outcome although it wasn't completely unexpected,"" said U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman. ""We ask the Chinese government to consider an immediate humanitarian parole of Xue Feng thereby allowing him to get back to his family and his way of life."" The geologist, a naturalized American citizens, was convicted on charges of violating state secrets and faces a fine of 200,000 yuan (about U.S. $30,400). Xue has spent about three years in prison since his arrest. University of Chicago's Dr. David B. Rowley, Xue's former professor who has rallied for his release, said in July that Xue was languishing in prison on vague charges. ""I find this whole thing just unbelievable in no small part because the rationale is just so thoroughly flawed,"" Rowley said. Xue ""has always been a straight shooter,"" Rowley said. ""He was not ... a wheeler-dealer type."" He is ""an honest, hard worker and this came as a real surprise to him as well."" Xue was working in China as a leading geologist for the Colorado-based IHS Consulting firm, a global provider of energy-related information, Rowley said, and the information Xue was privy to did not include state secrets. While Rowley said he was not privy to the specific database mentioned in Xue's indictment, the professor said the pieces of information commonly contained in such databases are not state secrets. ""These types of databases usually contain information related to the petroleum potential of a given area, and that might include what wells already have been drilled and information on the geology and geophysical or underlying structure of these areas. That's pretty much it,"" he said. Xue's job as a leading consultant for IHS involved acquiring and reselling this type of data, Rowley said. He said that as a petroconsultant, Xue thought he was viewed favorably by the Chinese because he was able to sell to Chinese officials similar data from countries in which the Chinese had drilling interests. Rowley said Xue had resigned from IHS at the time of his arrest and believed that the warnings issued by Chinese officials concerning the database were not issued against him, but against his employers, he said. ""IHS is extremely disappointed at the news and is very sympathetic to the situation. We are continuing to work with our advisors on the issue,"" IHS spokesman Ed Mattix at the time of Xue's sentencing in July. CNN's Jaime FlorCruz contributed to this story.","The American citizen was sentenced to eight years for allegedly violating state secret laws .

"(CNN) -- In 1996, when she was 4 years old, Catherine MacLean learned she had aplastic anemia. For seven years, she lived from hospital visit to hospital visit, one transfusion to the next. It wasn't until the summer of 2002 that her world suddenly included what was possible beyond the walls of her illness. She was 11. For many of the years in between, her disease controlled her life -- aplastic anemia is a type of bone marrow failure that made it impossible to produce enough red blood cells to support her body. In 2001, Catherine spent three weeks in isolation at a clinic so that she could get a bone marrow transplant. All visitors had to scrub down before entering the room, and her mother had to wear a surgical mask if she slept there. When she went back to school, Catherine had kept up academically, but the social environment at the school made for a difficult transition. ""I was definitely clearly very aware that I was different from the other kids in my class, in a lot of ways -- in terms of maturity, in terms of risk taking,"" Catherine told CNN. ""There's just this gap in experience, because I've just done things and been to places that they just haven't."" To help her meet other kids who understood, Catherine's doctors encouraged her to go to a special summer camp for seriously ill children. The Hole in the Wall Gang Camps were started by actor Paul Newman ""to acknowledge luck; the chance of it, the benevolence of it in my life, and the brutality of it in the lives of others, made especially savage for children because they may not be allowed the good fortune of a lifetime to correct it."" The camp Catherine attended, in Ashford, Connecticut, is staffed by cabin counselors, doctors and nurses, and it prides itself on giving kids a place where they will feel ""safe, respected and loved."" For these kids, suffering from diseases such as hemophilia, sickle cell anemia and cancer, it is a chance to see past the walls of the hospital to what the world might be like if a diagnosis didn't control their every move, if clinics and hospital rooms weren't like second homes. CEO Jimmy Canton has been with the camp since it started in 1988. He describes it as a place where children are encouraged to look beyond what they thought was possible: ""They've been told over and over again what they can't do. And camp reminds them that there's an enormous amount of things that they can do."" Nicole Kucine is a pediatric hematologist and oncologist who's getting more training at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and has volunteered at the camp for four years. Outside of the summer, she works closely with many sick children in hospitals and clinics; at the camp, she sees ill children in an entirely different light. What she sees -- children dancing around dining halls, inviting and insisting that she join in -- is invigorating. ""Seeing kids kind of ignore their disease was amazing. That they have to take medicine when they eat their meals wasn't a big deal. They could be normal,"" she told CNN. ""Normal"" was not something Catherine was that familiar with before camp. The start of camp coincided with the one-year anniversary of her transplant, and her doctors were just starting to use the word ""cure."" At the camp, Catherine was embraced by young counselors, eager to get to know her. Many of the counselors were in college, which helped her envision what had for so long been an intangible future. ""My sort of vision of my life had always been very narrowed, and it was always very much a day-by-day. It was like in a week, I have to get another blood transfusion, and in a couple months, we're gonna be changing my medication, and in a couple months, we're gonna transplant,"" she told CNN. The experience allowed Catherine to think, ""There's things out there. I can set long-terms goals now. I can have long-term goals. There's things that I'm going to be able to do."" The friends from her camp still provide support and understanding today, when ""normal"" life can get complicated. Explaining the intricacies of her illness could be daunting to a college freshman trying to make new friends. But her camp friends can commiserate over routine checkups and test results without requiring any explanation. The camp also changes the way children interact with authority figures. In hospitals, there are always many caretakers who often do things to sick children that are uncomfortable, like drawing blood or giving them medications. With events like ""Silly Olympics,"" the camp puts kids back in the driver's seat. Correctly answered trivia questions win campers the right to fling a spoonful of pudding in their counselor's face, or spray a counselor with a Super Soaker, or perhaps make lemonade mix in a counselor's mouth. ""Silly Olympics is, here's this authority figure, but you're allowed to throw pudding at them, you're allowed to strike back, you're allowed to kind of take control of the situation in a way that a lot of these kids get control over their bodies and their lives just completely taken away from them,"" Catherine said. ""In the hospital, you're a patient, that's all you are; in a lot of ways, you are your illness. And here, you're getting up on stage and you're a singer or you're a wood shop craftsman or you're a fisherman, you get to try different things, and so you can take back a sense of 'I like to fish, I'm good at this, I discovered this talent,' "" she told CNN. This year, as Catherine finishes up her first year of college, she looks forward to many possibilities, such as medical research and graduate school. But she says the camp has also opened up her eyes to the social side of medicine, and she is considering going into public health or pursuing a job that supports patients. But for now, she is just excited about her summer job. She'll be going back to the camp that changed her life, but this time as a counselor. For thousands of very sick children around the world, summer camp is not just a place to escape parents and make new friends.","In 1996, Catherine MacLean learned she had aplastic anemia, hospital stays became her norm .

"(CNN) -- Striker Emmanuel Adebayor has committed himself to Arsenal by signing a new contract with the English Premier League club. Emmanuel Adebayor has been a big success since joining Arsenal from French club Monaco. The Togo international has been the subject of much speculation this summer, with Italian club AC Milan making their interest in the player well known, and he was also linked with Barcelona. Arsenal were determined to keep the 24-year-old despite putting a reported $70 million price tag on him, and Adebayor revealed at the start of this month that he would sign a new contract. The terms of the deal were not disclosed by the London outfit, who described it as a ""long-term contract."" ""Arsenal can confirm that Togolese forward Emmanuel Adebayor has signed a new long-term contract with the club,"" read a statement on the club's Web site on Monday. ""Everyone at Arsenal looks forward to Emmanuel's continued contribution to the club over the coming years."" The UK Press Association reported that the deal was worth around $160,000 a week and would tie the former Monaco striker to Arsenal until at least 2012. Adebayor scored 30 goals in all competitions last season, and was named in the PFA Team of the Year. He also finished in third place in the PFA Player of the Year. However, fans started to turn on him during pre-season as it became apparent that he would not turn down a move away from Arsenal, and he was again booed by sections of the crowd during Saturday's Premier League opener against West Brom. However, manager Arsene Wenger said the player had his full support. ""We have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team -- you want your own fans to be behind him,"" Wenger told PA. ""What happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides, but overall I am positive he will recover. Every player needs to feel wanted. I think he is settled in his own mind. He has given a lot in the first two games."" Arsenal defeated West Brom 1-0 with a goal from summer signing Samir Nasri to follow up last Wednesday's 2-0 victory against Dutch side Twente in the first leg of their Champions League third-round qualifier. The Gunners travel to London rivals Fulham on Saturday, then play the home leg against former England manager Steve McClaren's Twente on the following Wednesday.","Emmanuel Adebayor commits himself to Arsenal by signing a new contract .

"(CNN) -- Emergency crews freed an injured caver Monday who fell during a difficult expedition through a remote Franklin County, Tennessee, cave, a county spokesman said. The nature of the man's injuries was unclear, according to county spokesman Chris Guess, who said the victim would be transferred to Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga for treatment. The man fell Sunday afternoon on the seventh of eight vertical descents, or drops, inside the Sinking Cove Cave in southern Tennessee, not far from the Tennessee-Alabama border, according to Brian Krebs with the Southeastern Cave Conservancy. The group holds the lease on the cave. The expedition being attempted by the man, who is an experienced caver according to Krebs, would rate about a 9.5 on a difficulty scale of 10, he said. Before the rescue, Krebs said extracting the injured man from the cave would be a challenge. Not only did he have to be lifted through the seven drops, but the man had to pass through a small crawl space that is about eight inches high and 14 inches wide, Krebs said. Rescue workers made that crawl space bigger so they could get him out, according to Guess. The rescue was complicated by the lack of cell service and the remote location. Krebs said the site is ""about as far back in the wilderness as you can go."" CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","NEW: A man injured during a Tennessee cave expedition is freed .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- Jordan's King Abdullah II has made a call for national unity and reform following bloody clashes between protesters and government loyalists late last week, the country's Petra News Agency reported. ""What matters to us in this stage is that our national unity must not be undermined,"" the king said Sunday, while visiting the southern region of Petra.  ""We are proceeding in earnest with the political reform process and we have nothing to fear."" The assurances from King Abdullah came two days after Friday's clashes left dozens injured and as opposition groups continued to demand the resignations of the country's prime minister and senior security officials. ""We recognize the difficult conditions and challenges the Kingdom and the whole region are passing through,"" the king said, ""but we are optimistic about the future we seek through developmental and economic projects."" The demonstrations turned violent as government loyalists clashed with protesters calling for the dissolution of parliament, an elected government and constitutional reforms. Dozens were injured as the two sides converged in a hail of rocks and swinging sticks, according to protest organizers and the government. At least 62 people and 58 security force members were injured, the country's General Security Directorate said. One man died of a heart attack in Friday's protests, officials said. Among those calling for the dismissal of government officials were family members of the 56-year-old protester. The brothers and sons of Fakhri Jamil blamed the heart attack on beatings they say he sustained from security forces and ""thugs."" Meanwhile, Jordanian Interior Minister Saad Hayel Srour and Gen. Hussain al-Majali, the head of Jordan's Public Security Department, told reporters Saturday that gatherings such as Friday's, which occupy a main area and disrupt day-to-day activities, will not be tolerated. Security forces have allowed peaceful protests in the kingdom for more than 12 weeks, the two said. Al-Majali said security forces should not be accused of any shortcomings or negligence during Friday's protest, noting that had they not intervened during the clashes, ""today we would have had funerals that cannot be counted."" He said the forces practiced restraint and intervened only to prevent bloodshed and save citizens' lives.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Seven people, including some accused of having ties to a U.S.-backed Farsi-language radio station, were arrested in Tehran, according to Iranian media reports. The seven ""worked as liaisons for anti-revolution satellite organizations and Zionist media,"" the semi-official Iran Labour News Agency (ILNA) reported Sunday. The people were connected ""with the conspiracy,"" ILNA said, referring to recent anti-government protests in Iran. The arrests came in an ""intelligence ministry operation,"" ILNA said. ""These people were connected with Radio Farda and had gone through the process of selection and training in Dubai and Istanbul and some of them had been officially employed by the U.S. intelligence service."" However, Radio Farda's director, Armand Mostofi, told CNN Sunday it has no employees inside Iran. Radio Farda is based in Prague, Czech Republic, and in Washington. It is affiliated with Radio Free Europe, and broadcasts from Prague. Mostofi said he first heard of the arrests in Iranian news reports. ""A lot of our news comes from the relationships with our listeners,"" he said. ""It's a two-way relationship. Hundreds of thousands of our listeners call in to inform us of what is going in Iran."" He said Iran has consistently blocked the station's Web site and has tried to jam their satellite signal. ""The crackdown of journalists in Iran has worsened in the aftermath of the presidential elections,"" Mostofi said. ""Iran used to be the largest prison for journalists in the Mideast, and unfortunately, has become the largest prison in the world for journalists.""

"(CNN) -- Heavy winds from a severe storm caused significant damage, shattered windows and sent debris raining down on passengers at an airport in St. Louis Friday night. The Lambert-St. Louis International Airport is closed indefinitely while officials investigate the damage, St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay told reporters. ""There was a reported sighting of a tornado. Although that has not been confirmed, that storm caused significant damage to the airport,"" he said. The reported tornado twisted metal and blew out plate-glass windows in the airport's main terminal, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. Four people were transported to nearby hospitals with injuries, Slay said. Passengers were hit with flying glass and debris as winds ripped off part of the roof in the airport's C concourse, the station reported. One witness described a chaotic scene outside the terminal as officials evacuated passengers from at least one aircraft. ""The plane was rocking back and forth,"" said Brett Knewitz of Albuquerque, New Mexico, who was on a plane that was about to take off from the airport when the storm hit. Initially officials did not allow evacuated passengers into the airport, he said, because of concerns that the building's roof would collapse.Once he was allowed inside, Knewitz said he saw an injured gate agent. ""She was bleeding like crazy,"" he said. Concourse C is used by American Airlines, AirTran and Cape Air, airport spokesman Jeff Lea said. The National Weather Service said witnesses believe a tornado was on the ground for several miles and observed the twister from a tower at the airport. KSDK reported that the storm also blew the steeple off a church and forced authorities to close highways.

"(CNN)  -- Juventus named former club captain Antonio Conte as their new coach Tuesday in place of Luigi Delneri. The 41-year-old former Italian international has signed a two-year contract which ties him to the Turin giants until the end of June 2013. Juve officially announced Delneri's departure on their club website earlier in the day although the 60-year-old had revealed on the final weekend of the Serie A season he would be departing. It followed a difficult season in which the 'Old Lady' finished seventh in the standings for the second straight year and missed out on European qualification. Conte has a solid record as a coach, guiding Siena to promotion back to Serie A last season, a feat he had already achieved with Bari in 2009. He believes that Juventus have the ingredients in place to enjoy success: . ""There's an excellent foundation with some investments made last year, I'm very calm, there's absolutely no need to start all over,"" he told AFP. ""All we need to do is adjust certain things and provide great motivation and desire to a group with a great base."" Conte was a crowd favorite with the club's supporters, winning a host of titles during his 13-year playing career, including an Intercontinental Cup, the Champions League, the UEFA Cup and five Serie A titles. ""Hard work, competitiveness and drive form the basis of Conte's managerial beliefs. The same qualities that made him one of Juve's greatest ever winners,"" said a statement on the club's official website.

"(CNN) -- A Canadian man suspected of killing a university student who was last seen alive via webcam made his first court appearance on Thursday, officials said. Brian Dickson, 29, remains in custody after Toronto police arrested him Wednesday afternoon and charged him with the first-degree murder of a 23-year-old exchange student from Beijing. His next court appearance is set for April 26, said Brendan Crawley, a spokesperson for the ministry of the attorney general's office. Crawley described Dickson's court appearance Thursday as ""procedural"" but he would not elaborate. Authorities have not said how they tied Dickson to the death of the student, Qian Liu. Police said early last Friday, Liu was talking via webcam to a male friend in China when a man allegedly knocked on the door of her Toronto apartment, asking to use her phone. The online witness said he saw Liu and the unknown man struggle for a time before the attacker turned off her laptop, police said. ""The man tried to hurt (Qian Liu)"" the witness told CNN affiliate CTV.  ""She was resisting and saying 'No, no, please don't.' At that time my mind went blank. And I was cursing him from my webcam."" ""I was so far away I couldn't reach her,"" he added. ""I felt helpless and I couldn't calm down."" Ten hours later, police arrived at the basement apartment to find Liu's body, naked from the waist down. Her laptop was missing. There were no obvious signs of sexual assault or severe physical trauma, and police have said they were awaiting toxicology reports. Liu's father, Liu Jianhui, told CNN affiliate CTV that he had trouble believing the incident. ""At the beginning I did not believe it was true,"" he said. ""She was a very hardworking, outstanding girl."" This is not the first time a crime has been captured by webcam. In the most notorious incident, Meleanie Hain of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, was shot dead in 2009 while talking to a friend via webcam. The friend was looking away when he heard a shot and a scream, police said. Upon looking back at the screen, the friend saw Hain's husband firing a handgun at where his wife had been, authorities said. Police later found both Hain and her husband dead in their home.","NEW: A man suspected of killing a university student makes his first court appearance .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods' former coach Butch Harmon has revealed his fears for the former world No. 1's future, after injury forced the American out of the opening round of the Players Championship at Sawgrass on Thursday. Harmon believes a huge question mark now looms over Woods' career after the 14-time major winner forfeited his round after playing just nine holes in a six-over-par total of 42, which included a triple-bogey at the par-four fourth. ""I think his whole future is up in the air,"" Harmon told reporters. ""Does it mean he needs more surgery? If he does who knows what is going to happen."" Speaking to reporters after pulling out, Woods added: ""I felt good this morning and fine during warm-up and then as I played, it got progressively worse. The knee acted up then the Achilles followed after that, then the calf started cramping up."" The 35-year-old's career has been marred by four knee operations and the Players Championship was his first tournament since injuring his knee and Achilles heel during a difficult stroke on the 14th in the third round of The Masters in April. Woods was then forced to withdraw from the Wells Fargo Championship earlier in May and his latest injury has compounded worries for his career, which has not seen a victory in 18 months and a major title win in three years. Woods' withdrawal mirrors his showing at last year's Players Championship, where a neck injury brought an end to his bid on the seventh hole in the final round. He now has just over a month to get fit enough for the U.S. Open, but medical experts are doubtful that he will be able to recuperate in time for the required practice rounds ahead of the championship tournament at Bethesda on June 16-19. Meanwhile, England's Chris Wood mastered tricky conditions to open up a three-shot lead at the halfway stage of the Iberdrola Open in Majorca on Friday. The 23-year-old carded a five-under-par 65 to move to eight-under-par after 36 holes -- ahead of compatriot Matthew Nixon and Northern Irishman Darren Clarke, who both hit level 70s. Wood is eyeing his maiden European Tour victory after losing a playoff to British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen at the Africa Open in East London in January. Overnight leader Gregory Bourdy of France, who set a course record 63 on Thursday, slumped to a seven-over-par 77 to leave him on level par 140.","Coach Butch Harmon reveals fears for injured Tiger Woods, who pulls out at Sawgrass .

"(CNN) -- French peacekeepers in war-torn Ivory Coast were in control of the airport in the main city of Abidjan, the French Ministry of Defense said Sunday, as a battle for the city seemed to be looming. An additional 350 French troops joined the United Nations peacekeeping mission overnight, the ministry added. There were about 7,500 troops already in the country under the U.N. mandate. United Nations helicopters and French forces patrolled the skies over the city, as a tense calm reigned Sunday morning, a local resident told CNN. The uneasy peace came in the wake of claims of a massacre as fighters backing internationally recognized President Alassane Ouattara battle forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo, who refuses to leave office. Foreign journalists reported being targeted and scrutinized. A group of journalists from the French TV channel France 2 were fired on by Gbagbo's forces when they tried to leave the Novotel hotel in Abidjan, according to the channel and two journalists who, to protect their security, did not want their names used. Since then, Gbagbo forces have been patrolling the hotel premises, preventing foreign journalists staying there from leaving, the sources said. One resident, whom CNN is not naming to protect his safety, said he had been to church as usual, where another parishioner said he had seen dead bodies by the road on his way to the congregation. A journalist in the city said many people were afraid to leave their homes, but were being forced to venture out to get water. Seyi Rhodes, who is staying at a hotel in Abidjan, said people were risking being shot in order to get to a water pump near the hotel. He saw French journalists come under fire, as they drove through the city, he said. Much of the city has no electricity, he added, calling it ""a really crude tactic to get people out on the streets."" The United Nations moved about 200 personnel within the country for their own safety, as the situation got worse, spokesman Nick Birnback said Sunday. ""Peacekeepers and staff have been attacked over the last few days, we've taken some casualties, and we are doing everything we can do to guarantee security as best as possible. The situation is deteriorating and is getting worse,"" he said. CNN iReport: Displaced victims of fighting in Duekoue, Ivory Coast  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton demanded Sunday that Gbagbo step aside immediately. ""Gbagbo is pushing Cote d'Ivoire into lawlessness,"" she said, using the French name for the country. ""He must leave now so the conflict may end."" She also called ""on the forces of President Ouattara to respect the rules of war and stop attacks on civilians."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague on Sunday said Britain renewed ""our call for Gbagbo to get out, which would stop this violence,"" and raised the possibility of International Criminal Court prosecutions stemming from the conflict. French President Nicolas Sarkozy met with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and requested the full implementation of a Security Council resolution, adopted last week, that calls on Gbagbo to step aside immediately, Sarkozy's office said. A French plane evacuated about 170 foreigners from Abidjan to Dakar, Senegal, according to Col. Thierry Burkhard of the French Ministry of Defense. The International Crisis Group called for an immediate cease-fire on both sides and more international intervention, calling the situation in Ivory Coast as ""urgent as any facing the international community right now. The unthinkable is unfolding before our eyes."" A key aide to Gbagbo on Sunday criticized the foreign forces in the country as an ""army of occupation"" and said they are not authorized to occupy the airport. ""The U.S. and France are not entitled to determine, to decide on who is able to conduct the destiny of Ivory Coast,"" Toussaint Alain told Reuters in Paris. ""The U.S. and France have only contributed toward worsening the tensions since the end of the second round of the presidential election -- two leading powers who are behaving without responsibility in Ivory Coast."" Alain said the U.N. mandate does not authorize the French forces to be in control of the Abidjan airport. The resolution does, however, allow the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Ivory Coast to use ""all necessary means"" to protect civilians who are under ""imminent threat of physical violence"" -- and it calls upon member nations to enable the peacekeepers, and the French forces who support them to carry out that mission. The International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday that 800 people had been shot to death in the western cocoa-producing town of Duekoue. A United Nations official put the death toll so far at 330 on Friday. The massacre occurred between Monday and Wednesday as Ouattara's Republican Forces led an offensive through the country to Abidjan, said Guillaume Ngefa, the deputy human rights director at the U.N. mission in Ivory Coast. He blamed 220 deaths on forces loyal to Ouattara. Ngefa said pro-Gbagbo forces killed 100 people. ""We have evidence, we have pictures. This was retaliation,"" he said, referring to Ouattara's forces. The Ouattara camp said it ""firmly rejects such accusations and denies any involvement by the Republican Forces of Cote d'Ivoire in possible abuses."" ""The government wishes to establish that the situation is quite the opposite,"" it said. ""Forces loyal to former President Laurent Gbagbo and its affiliated mercenaries and militias that have engaged in countless atrocities in western Cote d'Ivoire during their flight before the advance of Republican Forces of Cote d'Ivoire."" Ouattara denied to U.N. secretary-general that his forces were responsible, but said he had launched an investigation and that he would welcome an international inquiry, according to the world body. Ngefa said so far, 320 bodies have been identified and the actual number could be much higher. He said the dead included civilians as well as mercenaries. Before the Duekoue killings, human rights monitors documented 462 deaths in the Ivory Coast conflict, which would make the Duekoue massacre the single bloodiest incident yet. The International Committee of the Red Cross sent a team to Duekoue on Thursday and found most of the victims were civilians, said spokesman Kelnor Panglungtshang in Abidjan. ""They saw the bodies on the streets,"" he told CNN. ""There were so many."" Ngefa said a contingent of U.N. peacekeepers is stationed in Duekoue and is patrolling the town. The massacre illustrated the bloody nature of Ivory Coast's conflict, now in its fifth month. The violence erupted after a disputed November election led both Gbagbo and Ouattara to claim the presidency. The international community recognized Ouattara as the legitimate winner, but Gbagbo refused to cede power, and violence engulfed the nation, escalating this week with a major offensive launched by Ouattara's forces. A spokesman for Ouattara said Saturday the other side has committed atrocities, is losing its top generals to defections and is looking for ""cannon fodder"" for its last stand. The claims by Ouattara spokesman Patrick Achi could not be independently verified by CNN. Fierce fighting has erupted for control of Abidjan, Ivory Coast's largest city. Gbagbo's forces were thought to be on the brink of defeat but regained key areas Saturday. They said they retook control of Ivory Coast's all-powerful state-run television network that has been the embattled president's voice in his standoff with Ouattara. Ouattara's side denied Gbagbo was in control of state television, claiming he was actually broadcasting from a satellite truck. Gbagbo's whereabouts were unknown. He has not recently appeared in public, and the French ambassador said his residence was empty. The violence has also displaced one million of Abidjan's four million people.

"(CNN) -- Luke Donald maintained his bid to become the world's No. 1 golfer as he battled back from a horror start to his third round at the European Tour's BMW PGA Championship on Saturday. The Englishman remained tied for the lead with teen prodigy Matteo Manassero going into Sunday's final round in England as he retrieved a six-shot deficit. Donald, who needs to finish ahead of top-ranked Lee Westwood to go to the summit for the first time, had begun the day level with the 18-year-old Italian and Spain's Alvaro Quiros. But two double-bogeys and another dropped shot in his first six holes left last weekend's World Match Play Championship runner-up struggling before he rallied with four birdies on the back nine of the revamped Wentworth course. Donald said he planned to consult with his U.S.-based coach Pat Goss after his unusually erratic showing. ""He might have seen something and a little key could make a big difference. I didn't have much control of the ball, but I dug deep and I'm very proud of the way I came back,"" he told the European Tour website. ""I am going to have to play better than that for sure. I felt somewhat like Seve (Ballesteros) -- in the trees, leaves on my back, dropping the ball, escaping from everywhere. ""It would have been very easy to keep the head down and shoot myself out of the tournament, but I don't like to do that and it was a great fightback."" Manassero also carded a one-over-par 72 to be five-under 208, with last season's European Tour rookie of the year mixing three bogeys with two birdies on his front nine. Westwood was tied for third on three under with Paraguayan surprise package Fabrizio Zanotti after a second successive 69 kept alive his hopes of a first win in the tour's flagship event. ""I am edging my way into the week and hopefully tomorrow I will play special because that's what I think I will need to win,"" he said. ""It was a good 69. You've got to be on your game -- it's a tough examination."" Zanotti, twice a runner-up in minor tour events, bounced back from four bogeys in his first seven holes to reel off five in a row and then another at 16 to also sign for a 69. Quiros dropped to a tie for eighth on 212 after suffering the embarrassment of two triple-bogeys in his 76. World No. 6 Rory McIlroy shot the best round of the day -- a four-birdie 68 marred by a dropped shot at the last -- to move up to a tie for 18th on 214.","Englishman Luke Donald retains joint lead at BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Four people were killed and two were wounded when a so-called sticky bomb attached to a vehicle exploded Wednesday evening in the Ashhabi neighborhood of eastern Falluja, local police told CNN. The fatalities -- three Interior Ministry officials and a child -- included the director of the Falluja police intelligence department, the deputy police chief of the Garma police station, the police commissioner and a 7-year-old boy, police said. The wounded included a 5-year-old boy and a police official, police said. The children -- brothers -- were playing when the vehicle drove by carrying the four police officials, who had attended a funeral in eastern Falluja and were returning home when it detonated, police said. Iraqi security forces in Falluja were investigating the incident. The report of the blast came after bombings in three Iraqi cities over the previous day killed five people and wounded several others, police told CNN. In one, a colonel was driving from his home in Kirkuk to the town of Dibia, where he served as police commander. Dibia is about 12 miles north of Kirkuk, which is in the country's north. There has been longstanding sectarian tension among Kurdish, Arab and Turkmen people in Kirkuk. The colonel was Kurdish, but there was no immediate information on whether the bombing was tied to ethnic hostilities. Over a two-hour period in and around the capital, Baghdad, on Wednesday, three attacks wounded several people, police said. Attackers shot and critically wounded a police colonel while he was driving near Shaab stadium in the east. Five people were wounded in a roadside bombing north of the city in Taji. And a police commissioner was wounded when a sticky bomb attached to his car exploded. On Tuesday night, three people were killed in Baghdad when a car bomb exploded on a commercial street in the southwestern Saydiya neighborhood. City police said 15 others were wounded. In Ramadi, more than 60 miles west of Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded near an Iraqi police patrol, and one police officer died.  Ramadi is in the predominantly Sunni Arab Anbar province, an area engulfed by violence during the height of the Iraq war. This came after a bloody Sunday, when 17 bombs exploded across Baghdad, killing at least 19 people and wounding more than 80, Iraqi authorities said. The attacks were the latest in a spate in recent weeks that have raised concerns about Iraq's ability to protect itself. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said he plans to meet this month with Iraqi political leaders to discuss whether to ask that U.S. troops remain in Iraq beyond the January 1, 2012, withdrawal deadline. The United Nations office in Iraq has expressed concern about recent violence targeting government and security officials. Al-Maliki has said al Qaeda and other terrorists are behind the killings, but he also has blamed political movements and security guards, and he has promised to pursue the attackers.","NEW: The casualties include a 7-year-old boy .

"Vatican City (CNN) -- Catholic faithful from around the world poured into Rome on Sunday as the Catholic Church declares Pope John Paul II ""blessed,"" a step below sainthood. There were cheers as Pope Benedict XVI personally beatified his predecessor, and a huge tapestry protrait of John Paul II was unveiled, showing him as the healthy, vigorous and relatively young man he was early in his papacy. A vial of John Paul II's blood was placed before the crowds, which were expected to be the largest in the Vatican since the late pope's funeral in 2005. The blood, which was taken from him by doctors during his final illness for possible transfusion, but never used, was displayed in a specially made silver reliquary. Next came requests -- first in English and then Polish -- that people put down their banners and flags, and pray silently. ""In heaven a very different celebration is taking place among the angels and saints!"" Benedict declared in his homily. The current pope echoed the many who credit the Polish-born pope with playing a key role in the defeat of Communism, saying he turned ""back with the strength of a titan -- a strength which came to him from God -- a tide which appeared irreversible."" John Paul II made a pilgrimage to his native land, then part of the Soviet-dominated Communist bloc, shortly after his election in 1978, and an estimated one third of the entire nation turned out to see him. ""Don't be afraid,"" he exhorted them. Poland's Solidarity union sprang up soon after, and became the most organized and powerful anti-Communist movement in the Soviet bloc. Many commentators said John Paul helped inspire the movement, which ultimately toppled Poland's Communist government in 1989. John Paul II's path to sainthood . Benedict on Sunday also praised John Paul's iron will in the face of his physical decline later in his life, saying, ""the Lord gradually stripped him of everything, yet he remained ever a 'rock,' as Christ desired."" More than a million pilgrims turned out in Rome, police said. Many in the throng waved Polish flags and holding images of John Paul II, who was archbishop of Krakow in Poland before being elected pope. The presidents of Italy and Poland were among 16 heads of state at the mass, alongside seven prime ministers, the Vatican said. There were also big crowds in Krakow for the event, where at least 50,000 people braved pouring rain at the Sanctuary of Divine Mercy in Lagiewniki. For those who couldn't make it to Rome or Krakow, the Vatican created a special Twitter feed for the event, @Pope2YouVatican. It also launched a Facebook page for it, and streamed it live to iPhones and iPads through Pope2You.net. Having visiting more countries than any previous pope and becoming the first pontiff from outside of Italy in 450 years, John Paul II also was the third-longest reigning pope in history. Catholics honor John Paul II in Bucharest,  Romania . The Vatican suggests he was seen in person by more than anyone else in human history, between his 104 foreign trips, the roughly 17 million pilgrims who attended weekly audiences with him at the Vatican over his long reign, and the millions more who saw him at special events in Rome. Did you encounter Pope John Paul II? There were demands for his immediate canonization when he died, with crowds chanting ""Santo subito,"" or ""Saint now."" But the late pope has critics as well as supporters, particularly among those who accuse him of not doing enough to stop the abuse of children by Catholic clergy. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) vowed to protest at 70 churches in seven countries Sunday, callingthe fast-tracking of pontiff's sainthood ""a callous PR juggernaut honoring the man who presided over much of the ongoing crisis."" But John Paul II's former spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, told CNN he had no doubt he had been in the presence of a saint. Navarro-Valls cited not only the pope's devotion at prayer, but his concern for others, noting that when the pope called him after the death of his father, his first question was: ""How is your mother?"" He also recalled the pope's informality, saying he sometimes had to remind himself that he was in the presence of the pope. And he said for the pope to retain his ""good humor"" at the age of 80, in the face of his weighty office and his physical suffering, ""is sanctity to me."" The pope's photographer . John Paul II was fast-tracked to beatification when he died in 2005, and becomes ""the blessed"" John Paul II barely six years after his death -- the fastest beatification in centuries. Navarro-Valls rejected the idea that the process was moving too fast to let history be the judge of John Paul II, saying canonization could take centuries. ""Once the virtues are clear, why wait?"" he asked. For beatification, a person must be credited with a miracle by the Catholic Church. Benedict ruled last year that John Paul II had miraculously cured a French nun of Parkinson's disease after his death. The pope himself suffered from the condition. The nun, Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, was one of two nuns who brought the silver reliquary with the blood to Benedict after John Paul II was beatified. Sister Tobiana, who worked in the late pope's household, was the other. The blood is still liquid because doctors added anti-coagulents to it when it was taken. The Catholic tradition of venerating saints' physical remains -- known as relics -- dates to the earliest days of the church. Chicago family credits Pope John Paul II with personal miracle . John Paul II's coffin has also been removed from its tomb and is on display for the faithful to venerate this weekend. To become saint, John Paul II would need to perform a second miracle. The man named by John Paul II to be archbishop of Valencia in Spain died on the eve of the beatification, the archdiocese announced Sunday. Agustin Garcia-Gasco, who was later promoted to cardinal by Benedict XVI, was found dead in his room in Rome at the age of 80, having watched preparations for the beatification the night before.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's former top intelligence official says the country does not have the ability to stop Iran's nuclear program and that a pre-emptive attack against the Islamic Republic would result in a regional war that would pose Israel with an ""impossible"" challenge. ""We do not have the ability to stop Iran's nuclear program. In the best case scenario we can push it off a bit,"" said former Mossad chief Meir Dagan in widely reported remarks to a Tel Aviv leadership conference Wednesday. ""It is important to know what the outcome of an attack on Iran would be, what would happen on the day after and what situation Israel would find itself in on the international stage,"" Dagan said. ""An attack on Iran would mean regional war, and in that case you would have given (Iran) the best possible reason to continue the nuclear program because the Iranians would then claim, 'We have been attacked by a foreign country that is reported to have a military nuclear capability. Now we have no choice but to defend ... against a country with strategic capabilities -- a compelling and principled argument for them to move to a large nuclear program,"" he added. ""It is important to know that that war would not just be against Iran. It would be a regional war that would include Syria -- if we needed to attack Hezbollah targets in Syrian territory. The regional challenge that Israel would face would be impossible."" The blunt public comments, which have been printed in various Israeli newspapers, are not the first from Dagan, who spent the last eight years heading the Israeli spy agency. Dagan left his position in January and in recent weeks has made a series of comments that have been at odds with the public policy positions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sensitive issue of Iran and it's nuclear program. Netanyahu has repeatedly maintained in public that all options including military force should be considered to force Iran to halt its nuclear program. Both Israel and the United States believe Iran is developing nuclear weapons -- an allegation leaders in Tehran deny,  maintaining  the program is for civilian use only. In his comments, Dagan compared the strategic environment facing Israel to the eve of the Yom Kippur war in 1973 and warned that the country should go to war only if it was attacked ""or if there is a gun to your head -- that is to say, conflict is unavoidable and the only way to minimize the threat is to use violence."" Dagan suggested conflict was not yet unavoidable and offered advice to the prime minister ""not to make a decision to attack Iran."" ""It is important to consider all options and not to run straight for the war option. At the moment no decision has been made to attack Iran, and I am not familiar with any decision to attack in 2011 or 2012,"" Dagan told the audience. In addition to Iran,  Dagan said it was crucial for Israel to present some sort of plan for getting talks restarted with Palestinians and suggested adopting the 2002 Saudi Peace  initiative, which outlines normalization of relations with Arab countries in  exchange for a Palestinian state based on 1967 lines with a ""just solution"" to  the Palestinian refugee issue. ""We have no other way,  and not because they are my top priority, but because I am concerned about  Israel's well-being and I  want to do what I can to ensure Israel's existence,"" Dagan said ""If  we don't make proposals and if we don't take the initiative, we will eventually  find ourselves in a corner."" It is not uncommon for former Israeli intelligence chiefs to be speak publicly, but for the widely respected Dagan to speak so openly and so soon after his departure has raised eyebrows in Israel. To that point, Dagan  told the Tel Aviv audience ""it is important for ex-officials to make their  opinions known."" The office of Prime Minister Netanyahu declined to comment on Dagan's remarks. Earlier in the year Dagan courted controversy when he stated that Iran would not be able to develop a nuclear weapon before 2015. which prompted Netanyahu to disagree publicly stating, ""I think that intelligence estimates are exactly that, estimates. They range from best case to worst case possibilities, and there is a range there, there is room for differing assessments.""","Meir Dagan is the former head of Israel's Mossad .

"Bulawayo, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai on Sunday urged his supporters to prepare for an election he hoped regional leaders would monitor to ensure a credible result to help end the troubled coalition government. ""Our brothers in SADC have been supportive of our endeavor toward democratizing Zimbabwe,"" he said. ""We hope SADC (Southern African Development Community) and the AU will continue to support our efforts to reject attempts to manipulate the will of the people and remain resolute in their approach in dealing with the Zimbabwe issue."" Tsvangirai's comments came at the end of his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) congress in Bulawayo, southwest of the capital, Harare. The prime minister said he was confident he would win the next election to end the power-sharing deal he entered with President Robert Mugabe, adding that his main task would be to revive Zimbabwe's economy. Mugabe wants the elections held this year, but Tsvangirai has demanded reforms first. Last week, the prime minister said elections would be held in 12 months. Tsvangirai and Mugabe formed a power-sharing government in 2009 after postelection violence following Mugabe's victory claim. The fragile coalition government has been marred by disagreements between the former political foes, with Tsvangirai claiming that Mugabe is reluctant to make Zimbabwe a democracy.","President Robert Mugabe wants the elections held this year .

"Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- The final launch of the space shuttle Endeavour was delayed Friday, temporarily putting off what promised to be an emotional moment for the mission's commander. Liftoff -- originally scheduled for 3:47 p.m. ET -- was delayed by at least 72 hours due to concerns with the shuttle's heating system. As part of NASA's examination of the problem, the shuttle's external fuel tank will be drained of its oxygen and hydrogen propellants. ""The engineering team did not understand how this problem occurred and did not feel comfortable proceeding with a launch attempt,"" NASA spokesman George Diller said. Cmdr. Mark Kelly's wife, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, traveled to Florida to watch the shuttle's ascent. President Obama and the first lady also went to the launch site, and Obama personally visited with Giffords for about 10 minutes, a White House official said. President meets with Giffords . Obama also met the entire Endeavour crew, including Kelly. ""I bet you were hoping to see a rocket launch today,"" Kelly told the president. ""We were hoping to see you,"" Obama told him. Kelly updated Obama and the first lady on Giffords' condition, and then they went down the corridor to see her, the administration official said. Three months ago, Giffords was nearly killed when a would-be assassin shot her in the head during a meeting with constituents in Tucson, Arizona. It was not immediately clear if Giffords' doctors -- who are overseeing her lengthy rehabilitation -- will allow her to remain in Florida for the duration of the delay. Giffords' office said Friday that her travel plans are ""undetermined,"" according to a statement. ""Congresswoman Giffords is disappointed that Endeavour was unable to launch today, but realizes that mission safety must come first. Launch delays are not uncommon with the space shuttle,"" the statement said. ""We are looking forward to the quick rescheduling of this scientifically important mission. The congresswoman was pleased, however, to have been able to meet with President Obama and the first family."" Space shuttle: What have we learned? Kelly was tapped to lead a crew that includes pilot Gregory Johnson; mission specialists Michael Fincke, Greg Chamitoff and Andrew Feustel; and European Space Agency astronaut Roberto Vittori. Endeavour has logged more than 103 million miles in space, blasting off 24 times, but its 25th flight will be its last. As NASA's shuttle program winds down with the last launch scheduled this summer, many in the astronaut corps are wrestling with what to do next. For the foreseeable future, Russian rockets will be the only way for U.S. astronauts to get to space. Fincke spent a total of a year in space on the International Space Station, getting there and back twice on Russian rockets. But Friday's delayed flight will be his first on the shuttle. ""I think all of us, with all the changes that are going on, with our country's space program and NASA, all of us professional astronauts are looking into our hearts to see what we're going to do next,"" Fincke said. Four spacewalks are planned for the mission. The space walkers will retrieve experiments, install new ones, refill tanks and lubricate parts at the International Space Station. In its cargo bay, Endeavour will carry the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. At $1.5 billion, it is the most expensive piece of equipment a space shuttle has ever carried. The spectrometer is designed to capture space particles like anti-matter and dark matter that scientists know very little about but believe exist in the universe. The spectrometer will be mounted outside the International Space Station. If it's successful, it could lead to a better understanding of how our universe began and evolved. A few months ago, before his wife was shot, Kelly talked about his upcoming mission. ""Flying in space is a very difficult thing to give up,"" Kelly said. ""I remember after my last flight thinking 'Well, maybe this is the last time I'm gonna do this.' And, you know, you go a couple of months out and you're like, 'Oh, I really hope this is not the end of my flying career.'"" Kelly said that when STS 134, the Endeavour's last flight, is over, ""I'll be thinking the same thing, I can't really give this up. I've got to figure out a way to get back into space.""

"(CNN) -- In a summer crowded with books about vampires, werewolves and things that go bump in the night, a young novelist is stepping forward with his own fresh take on the supernatural suspense thriller. Michael Koryta's newest novel is ""The Ridge."" At 28-years old, it's hard to call Koryta a veteran, but this is his eighth novel already. His work has won high praise from critics and some well-known peers, including best-selling authors Michael Connelly and Dennis Lehane. Set in rural Kentucky, Koryta's book includes a murder, a lonely lawman in love with a dangerous woman and a newspaper veteran determined to dig up the truth. But the story adds some chilling and unexpected twists, including a landlocked lighthouse, a mysterious blue light and a home for rescued lions, tigers and other big cats. CNN caught up with the author and the following is an edited transcript. CNN: What was the spark behind ""The Ridge""? Koryta: I wanted to write a contemporary thriller that drew from the feel of frontier folklore and legend. A single image -- a homemade lighthouse built in the woods -- got me started. I can't explain how I got to that, because I simply don't know. One day it was just there, and I've never loved a book cover as much as this one, because it captures the feel I had from the image: mysterious, haunting, ominous. A lot of the ghostly tales and legends that were in my mind at the time involved cats -- the mythical black panthers people are always claiming to spot, particularly -- and that gave the idea some traction, because I had a very real setting with which to work. There's a place in Indiana, not far from my hometown of Bloomington, called the Exotic Feline Rescue Center. This operation, which is truly out in the middle of nowhere, down a long gravel road, is currently home to 230 tigers, lions, cougars, leopards and other exotic cats that have been rescued from terrible, abusive circumstances. The center exists simply to provide safe homes for cats that have none. The very idea that there are so many exotic cats in need is strong on its own merits, but the center was also a gold mine of atmosphere for a novelist. It can be a very intimidating place the first time you see it. And, of course, these large cats are and always have been a source of endless fascination for humans. Every civilization that ever interacted with these animals had their own set of stories, symbolism and myth. So the spark was in the intersection of these things, in the idea of trying to create something very original that also carried with it a generations old weight of familiarity, that sense of legend. CNN: You started out writing crime novels, what prompted the change to supernatural? Koryta: Initially, it was simply the right fit for the story, that being ""So Cold the River."" I knew I wanted to draw upon the history and mythology that surrounded West Baden Springs, which was this glorious resort around the early 20th century, when people came from around the world to experience what they believed were truly miraculous mineral springs. It was also a story that required bridging eras. Those things just kept shouting ""Ghost story!"" and so I listened. During the course of writing that book, I really fell in love with the form. It didn't seem all that different to me -- still suspense, still mystery, just with a new layer, an added wrinkle. The supernatural elements were more of a plotting challenge, too, and I think good things happen when you challenge yourself as a writer. I never envisioned, early on, that I'd write anything with a supernatural thread. I suppose I shouldn't be overly surprised, because one of the really key moments in my writing life was when I found Stephen King's book "" On Writing,"" which is the definitive work on the craft for anyone who values storytelling first and foremost. At the time, while I read widely, I was very focused on writing detective novels. People don't really consider it because I'm a younger writer, but when ""The Silent Hour,"" the last of my detective novels to date, was released, I'd been working in that form for a decade. Trying something a little different was wonderful, creatively. You have only so many chances to tell stories. I didn't want to be forever wedded to one form of storytelling when there are so many out there. CNN: I've heard several of your novels may hit the the big screen? Koryta: Chris Columbus, who directed the first two Harry Potter films and was the family comedy king through the '80s and '90s -- ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" ""Home Alone,"" etc. -- has acquired rights to ""The Cypress House"" and is working on the script himself, with intent to direct. For ""So Cold the River."" I'm actually working on adapting the book with Scott Silver, who was just nominated for an Oscar for ""The Fighter,"" and who also wrote ""8 Mile,"" which I think is a terrific screenplay. The chance to work with Scott is a tremendous pleasure and I'm learning a lot. CNN: You've worked as a private investigator, a journalist and a teacher but I understand you knew at a young age that you wanted to be a writer? Koryta: Always, yeah. This was it. This was what I wanted to do from the time I began to read. I just fell in love with stories, with books. I was always writing. I finished my first novel, it was around 300 pages long, when I was 16. Wrote one more before I got out of high school, then wrote the first Lincoln Perry novel when I was 19. It didn't sell, but I liked the character and I knew the world so I tried what was, in my mind, a sequel. Wrote that when I was 20, and that one made it. That's ""Tonight I Said Goodbye,"" which came out when I was 21 and won some prizes and was nominated for the Edgar and translated into a bunch of foreign languages, all while I was working two jobs and going to school. Looking back on that now, it seems impossible. The time management seems impossible. But right then, it was just my life, and I was having a lot of fun. I wrote from midnight to 3 a.m. because that was when I had free time. It never felt like work. It was fun, it was all I wanted to do, to be. I just wanted to get something between the covers, as my friend Stewart O'Nan says about his books. I love that phrase, particularly when it comes from such a brilliant novelist as Stewart, who is as good as anybody alive. There's a humility in that, a gratitude: ""Just to get it between the covers."" The idea that it's a privilege to have that chance is really a good thing to remember. CNN: I understand music is a big source of inspiration to you while you write? Koryta: It runs the engine, plain and simple. At the start, I needed headphones because I was writing in my college apartment and my roommate was, you know, entitled to do his thing and not create a cocoon of silence for my attempts at genius. Then I realized how much the music was impacting the mood of the writing, and I started to pair things up -- this song for this kind of scene, things like that. Then I'd get superstitious -- you've had a good run on this playlist, don't change it until things tighten up. Like a baseball player not changing socks. I usually pick one song that I listen to with my eyes closed every day before I start writing. That can range from classical to rap. In one case, a song inspired the entire book. ""So Cold the River"" developed from my imagining a story behind Joshua Bell's violin piece ""Short Trip Home."" For ""The Ridge"" I was really into The National, riding their album ""High Violet"" pretty hard, and a band called Gaslight Anthem, and of course the two artists I quote in the book, Josh Ritter and Joe Pug. They're brilliant songwriters. Just brilliant. Ritter has made a good name for himself but Pug is criminally overlooked at this point. He'll be around for a long, long time, though. He's that good. CNN: What's next for you? Koryta: I stepped back and took a breath. That needed to be done. I went almost two months without writing a word of prose, but I needed that after the last stretch, I really did. Now I'm back at it. The next book is a return to traditional crime fiction, no ghosts in sight, and it is one I've wanted to write for a long time. It's about two brothers who lost a sibling to violent crime when they were in their teens, and went about coping in very different ways. One is an ex-cop turned bail bondsman, the other a high school football coach who is involved with prison ministry. It's set in Ohio, where high school football is a very big deal, and I've always wanted to mine from sports for fiction and never really had a chance. As I said earlier, we have a limited number of shots, so I felt it was time to take this one.","Michael Koryta's newest novel is ""The Ridge,"" his eighth at age 28 .

"(CNN)  -- Manchester United and former England midfielder Paul Scholes announced his retirement Tuesday and will join the coaching staff of the English Premier League champions. The 36-year-old made 676 appearances for the Red Devils, the last as a substitute in their 3-1 Champions League final reverse to Barcelona Saturday. Scholes won 10 Premier League titles with United and helped them to two Champions League triumphs. He won 66 England caps and played at the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, but quit international football in 2004 at the age of 29. But with his club form still impeccable, England coach Fabio Capello reportedly tried to persuade him to return for last year's World Cup campaign in South Africa. Announcing his retirement, Scholes told the official club website: . ""This was not a decision that I have taken lightly but I feel now is the right time for me to stop playing. ""To have been part of the team that helped the club reach that 19th (record) title is a great privilege. Scholes praised Alex Ferguson, calling him a ""great manager"" and the United boss reciprocated. ""What more can I say about Paul Scholes that I haven't said before,"" said Ferguson. ""We are going to miss a truly unbelievable player. ""Paul has always been fully committed to this club and I am delighted he will be joining the coaching staff from next season."" Scholes was part of the famous ""Class of 92"" which claimed the English FA Youth Cup in 1992 and included David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Gary Neville, who quit his United career earlier this season.","Paul Scholes announces his immediate retirement for football .

"(CNN) -- For most comics, filling three-fourths of the Ha Ha Room in Nowheresville, Large-Square-State, is an accomplishment worth celebrating ... alone, of course, in a guest room at the Holiday Inn with a bottle of gin. Not the case for Russell Peters. In fact, as one of the top-earning comics in the business, Peters enjoys worldwide popularity that's hard to match, selling out arenas (yes, arenas) from Canada to Australia and everywhere in between. Focusing on race and class, Peters draws from being Indian and Canadian, and he believes audiences around the globe like him because he's an outsider. ""It's like I'm reporting live from a party I shouldn't be at,"" he says. ""There's the cool kids, and then there's the nerdy guy who snuck in wearing a hat. I'm the nerdy kid who's wearing the hat."" What makes Peters' success even more amazing is that, aside from the occasional stand-up comedy special, you probably haven't seen him on TV or in movies. Sure, he's done a bit of acting, but a quick glance at the titles on his IMDb page doesn't reveal any blockbusters. That said, ""The Legend of Awesomest Maximus"" does stand out as a potential must-see. I mean, after all, it features Ian Ziering playing a character named Testiclees. So it must be good! When the 40-year-old Peters -- who has penned a memoir called ""Call Me Russell,"" in which he chronicles the unlikely path of his career from scrawny loser to comedy megastar -- met with CNN, he walked into the room wearing a T-shirt adorned with the image of that Internet-famous fat kid whose own shirt reads, I F--- ON THE FIRST DATE.

"(CNN) -- While al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden may have provided the impetus for the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, whose Taliban-led government was harboring him, his death may have little impact on the continuing course of the war or on the continuing threat of terrorism, analysts said Monday. ""If the core issue was the Taliban fighting for the right to protect Osama bin Laden as their honored guest, then a big part of the war goes away,"" said Frank Anderson, who served as chief of the CIA's Afghan Task Force from 1991-95 and currently serves as president of the Middle East Policy Council in Washington. But if the core issue has morphed into a civil war or a war between ethnic Afghans against a foreign military force, then little has changed, he said. ""All the issues that divide the ethnic groups are still there."" Inside the raid that killed Osama bin Laden . Anderson predicted that bin Laden's death will result in an immediate, short-term spike in motivation among his followers to carry out more terrorist attacks, but said any such spike will likely be short-lived as the information found in bin Laden's house leads investigators to track down other terrorists. Anderson noted that bin Laden's influence was tough to find in the spawning of the ""post-Islamist, post-radical, nationalist and post-imperialist narrative"" that spread this spring across the Arab and Islamic world. ""What we have is a growing population or political awareness that doesn't care any more about those narratives,"" Anderson said. ""That's a whole lot more significant than whether or not bin Laden's holed up in a windowless building in Pakistan."" But no one denied that the slain leader of al Qaeda leaves a staggering legacy. ""Bin Laden's objective in 9/11 was to sucker us into an invasion of Afghanistan with the idea that we'd be bogged down there for a long time and would impoverish ourselves,"" Anderson said, noting that the United States now faces a huge debt burden and has incurred tens of thousands of casualties. Across the world, ""his legacy is at least hundreds of thousands of dead people, the vast majority of whom were Muslims."" And he has also caused ""very serious damage to Pakistan as a viable nation state,"" Anderson said. About bin Laden's death, ""I don't think it's really going to have a significant impact on what's going on in Afghanistan,"" said Mike Baker, who worked for 17 years at the CIA, where he served as covert operations officer until he left at the end of the 1990s. What does the killing of bin Laden compare to? Asked about how bin Laden will be regarded in a decade, Baker said that, for a certain segment, ""he's always going to be a martyr and figurehead and legend and yadda yadda yadda. For the rest of the world, he'll be thrown into the pile of mass murderers that have been consigned to history."" But Baker, who is now president of Diligence LLC, a global intelligence and security firm, said it would be naive for anyone to consider bin Laden's death to be a game changer in the global effort against terrorism. ""They've got the same operational capabilities that they had yesterday."" Steve Coll, president of the New America Foundation and author of ""Ghost Wars, the Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001,"" predicted that no one will emerge to lead al Qaeda ""with the same kind of myths and spiritual presence and credibility"" that bin Laden had among his followers. He too urged that it not be written off. ""This is still a resilient militant organization,"" he said. ""A small number of people can do a lot of damage in this world."" Andrew Bacevich Sr., a professor of international relations at Boston University and a retired career officer with the U.S. Army, said the raid on bin Laden's residence could have an impact on the conduct of the war in Afghanistan. ""I don't think this means anything like a rush to the exits in Afghanistan, but I think there is an argument brewing about whether or not the tactics being employed in Afghanistan are working or not, and this might arm the people in the camp that think that large-scale troop presence ends up being counterproductive,"" he said. But over the long term, ""I think his death is irrelevant,"" Bacevich said. ""What we call terrorism is an expression of resentment by Muslims directed at Western intervention, presence and meddling in the Islamic world. Bin Laden made himself the principal manifestation of that resentment and launched the most successful attack, but the conditions giving rise to that resentment don't go away just because he's gone away. Muslim world had soured on bin Laden . ""Remember: We're involved in a war in Afghanistan, the remnants of a war in Iraq, a new war in Libya; we continue to conduct UAV (drone) attacks in Pakistan. However much we may say that our purposes are looked toward peace, it's not difficult to understand how people in that part of the world would view us as aggressors. And I think that's what leads to terrorist attacks against the United States and its allies. And that doesn't change just because bin Laden's gone."" He too said the impact of bin Laden's death could affect U.S.-Pakistani operations. If it turns out that the United States carried out the operation without notifying Pakistani officials, ""that would seem to suggest that the level of trust between us and Pakistan is pretty close to zero,"" he said. Many questions about what Pakistan knew . ""Given the importance we've given to collaboration with Pakistani officials and given the resentment of the Pakistan public to U.S. violations of Pakistani sovereignty, this may really bring things to a head."" Bacevich was not persuaded by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's comment Monday to reporters that ""cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound in which he was hiding."" ""We don't know what the truth is about the level of cooperation or not cooperation,"" he said. ""That kind of statement from Hillary Clinton would seem to suggest that the United States wants to minimize evidence of mistrust, to sustain a pretense of trust rather than to confront what may, in fact, be the reality."" The implications of a real rupture in U.S.-Pakistani relations are frightening, he said. ""This one seems to be more fraught with mistrust than most any other relation we have. And you have to ask how long that can be sustained and whether or not something like this isn't another nail in the coffin.""","In Afghanistan, ""all the issues that divide the ethnic groups are still there,""

"(CNN)  -- Barcelona's French international defender Eric Abidal will undergo emergency surgery Thursday for a liver tumor, the Spanish champions have announced. The 31-year-old's condition was uncovered by a routine medical check after he felt unwell Tuesday. The club said the operation would begin at 1500 GMT, having been initially scheduled Friday. Abidal's plight has stunned his Barcelona teammates with vice-captain Xavi Hernandez speaking for many. ""This is the toughest time I've had at the club, but Abidal will get over it because mentally he's one of the toughest people I know,"" he told the club's official website. Barca president Sandro Rosell said the club would do ""everything within its power and more to aid his recovery."" Details about the extent of the tumor have not emerged, but, if it is benign, specialists say he could make a quick recovery after surgery. But his illness comes at a critical part of Barcelona's season as they bid for the domestic double in Spain and to win back the Champions League crown. Abidal played in both legs of Barcelona's Champions League last 16 win over Arsenal and has been recalled to the French international squad. Goodwill messages have flooded in from the club's supporters and Cristiano Ronaldo, Real Madrid's star player, also wished him a quick recovery. ""I hope that everything will be fine for Abidal and that he will return soon,"" he told AFP. Meanwhile, Manchester United revealed Wednesday that their former captain Bryan Robson had surgery for throat cancer earlier this month in Bangkok..

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- India detains hundreds of people each year without charge or trial to ""keep them out of circulation"" in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, according to a new report released Monday by Amnesty International. The human rights monitoring group documented how India's Public Safety Act (PSA) is used to justify long-term detentions of people, even when there is insufficient evidence for trial. The draconian act has come under repeated criticism from human rights groups who have expressed alarm over Kashmiris caught in the fight between Indian security forces and militant groups in the Himalayan state. The Amnesty report estimated that between 8,000 and 20,000 people were detained in the past two decades; 322 of them were held between January and September of last year when a wave of unrest swept the region and people took to the streets in deadly anti-government protests. ""The Jammu and Kashmir authorities are using PSA detentions as a revolving door to keep people they can't or won't convict through proper legal channels locked up and out of the way,"" said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific Director. ""Hundreds of people are being held each year on spurious grounds, with many exposed to higher risk of torture and other forms of ill-treatment."" Among the detainees are political leaders and activists, suspected members or supporters of armed opposition groups, lawyers, journalists, and protesters, including children, Amnesty said. The report said that often, people are initially picked up for ""unofficial"" interrogation and have no access to a lawyer or their families. Amnesty said the Indian government has relied on the safety act in dealing with a resurgence of street protests. ""Despite this apparent shift in the nature of the unrest, Jammu and Kashmir authorities continue to rely on the PSA rather than attempting to charge and try those suspected of committing criminal acts,"" Zarifi said. ""The PSA undermines the rule of law and reinforces deeply held perceptions that police and security forces are above the law."" The state's Chief Minister Omar Abdullah denied that so many people had been detained under the act. He said 4,046 people were arrested in the protests. But, he said, 3,900 of them were released and only 28 had been detained. A senior police officer told CNN that about 250 people were detained under the PSA in the past year but some had been released. The Indian state is divided into mostly Hindu Jammu and Muslim Kashmir, where many residents argue that the territory should have been a part of Pakistan when the subcontinent was partitioned in 1947. Polls have found a majority of Muslims in the state favor secession. The Indian government blames Pakistan for furling an insurgency in Kashmir. Tens of thousands of Kashmiris have died in the bloodshed over the years. Khurram Parvez, coordinator of the Jammu and Kashmir coalition of civil societies, said the Public Safety Act gives the Indian government powers to arbitrarily detain detain a person for two years without trial, against India's principles of justice. CNN's Moni Basu and Mukhtar Ahmed contributed to this story.","Amnesty International criticizes India's Public Safety Act .

"(CNN) -- It's called the ""Walmart of Weed."" This newest big-box store is devoted to selling marijuana-growing equipment. Its biggest outlet yet is to open Wednesday in Phoenix, where Arizona voters approved medical cannabis last fall. The weGrow Store will be the first outside California, where medical weed has long been legalized. None of the chain's three stores sell the drug. Instead, they unabashedly promote medical marijuana by offering ""everything -- from supplies to services -- that cultivators need to grow it,"" the company says. What sets weGrow apart from the mom-and-pop stores selling the growing supplies is that weGrow openly states its hydroponic equipment is intended for pot, a spokeswoman said. The smaller stores often claim the hydroponic equipment is used for growing indoor tomatoes and often kick out a customer if they broach the subject of medical cannabis, said weGrow spokeswoman Melissa DiGianfilippo. While 16 states and the District of Columbia now allow for some sort of medical marijuana, there remains ambiguity about whether U.S. authorities would ever enforce federal laws against marijuana distribution, though 90% of hydroponics revenue is from cannabis growers, DiGianfilippo said. In fact, the state of Arizona filed a federal lawsuit last week asking the courts to determine whether the voter-approved initiative legalizing medical marijuana is, indeed, legal. Calling itself ""the nation's only hydroponics franchise that openly talks about medical marijuana,"" the Oakland, California-based weGrow sees a boom in Arizona and projects 100,000 Arizonans acquiring state medical cannabis cards, DiGianfilippo said. So far, about 4,000 Arizonans became state-authorized marijuana users after the state began issuing the cards on April 15, DiGianfilippo said. WeGrow chose Wednesday to open its superstore because that was supposed to be the day the state was scheduled to begin accepting applications to run a marijuana dispensary. But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and Attorney General Tom Horne filed a federal lawsuit Friday seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the legality of Proposition 203. Voters approved the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act last November and Brewer signed it into law in December. Nonetheless, the federal government considers marijuana a controlled substance. In a May 2, 2011, letter, U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke of Arizona warned state officials that ""growing, distributing and possessing marijuana, in any capacity, other than as a federally authorized research program, is a violation of federal law regardless of state laws that purport to permit such activities,"" according to Brewer. Burke declared that his office would ""vigorously prosecute individuals and organizations that participate in unlawful manufacturing, distribution and marketing activity involving marijuana, even if such activities are permitted under state law,"" according to Brewer's office. ""The State of Arizona has worked to follow the wishes of voters,"" Brewer said in a statement. ""But I won't stand aside while state employees and average Arizonans acting in good faith are unwittingly put at risk. In light of the explicit warnings on this issue offered by Arizona's U.S. Attorney, as well as many other federal prosecutors, clarity and judicial direction are in order."" Brewer has directed that the Arizona Department of Health Services put on hold its process for licensing marijuana dispensaries, pending court action on this issue, Brewer's spokesman, Matthew Benson, told CNN on Tuesday. ""The agency will continue providing registration cards for individuals who receive a doctor's recommendation to use medical marijuana,"" Benson said in an e-mail. WeGrow founder Dhar Mann, a 27-year-old entrepreneur who opened his first store in Oakland after a small hydroponics store ejected him for asking about medical marijuana cultivation, said his firm still sees an opportunity in Arizona, where he estimates medical pot to be a billion-dollar industry. He has plans for similar superstores in other states with legal marijuana. The Phoenix store, located in an industrial area so as not to upset any homeowners, will be 21,000 square feet. Wednesday's grand opening in Phoenix will feature indoor growing demonstrations with nonmarijuana plants, experts on how to build professional grow rooms, a physician for patient evaluations and classes on how to safely and responsibly cultivate medical marijuana, weGrow officials said. The first weGrow store was a 15,000-square-foot facility that opened in Oakland last year, and in February, a 10,000-square-foot store opened in Sacramento, California, a spokeswoman said. Mann said the Arizona law allows for up to 124 dispensaries, and he took exception with the governor's lawsuit. ""Delaying the process that a majority of the Arizona voters have asked for prevents qualified cannabis patients from receiving medicine they need and causes unfair financial hardship to businesspeople who have invested tens of thousands of dollars in reliance on the process set up by the state,"" Mann said in a statement. ""Medical marijuana cultivating, dispensing, and consuming will exist with or without governmental approval,"" Mann said. ""It's time to tax and regulate this industry so legitimate business people and patients are not criminalized.""","The weGrow firm will open its third superstore in Phoenix on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- An Israeli business tycoon whose company was cited by the U.S. State Department for allegedly having trade relations with Iran has died. Sammy Ofer died Friday after battling an illness, his representatives said. He was 89. Ofer's company, Tanker Pacific, recently was named by the State Department as one of seven companies who were involved in trade with Iran, thereby breaching international restrictions imposed as part of an effort to suppress Tehran's nuclear program. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg said Ofer's company is on the list of businesses ""engaged in activities related to the supply of refined petroleum products in Iran."" Ofer's company publicly denied the accusations and referred to them as a possible ""misunderstanding."" ""We are acting together with Israeli officials and our advisors in Washington to remove our name from the list of sanctioned companies ...the company does not have any dealings, business or otherwise, with anyone that violates this embargo,"" the company said in a statement released last week. The revelation set off a public controversy in Israel, with questions being raised about what dealings the company had with Iran and what the Israeli government knew about such activities. Members of the Ofer family have argued this week that they have acted under the authority of the state of Israel, a claim that was bluntly denied by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""We did not approve any docking or unloading of commodities in Iran. Israel has a very clear policy with regard to Iran and no sort of relations with it are allowed,"" Netanyahu said Monday. A Knesset hearing into the matter earlier this week was canceled just as it was beginning under unusual circumstances when the chairmen of the committee, Carmel Shama, ended the session immediately upon receiving a personal note. Shama did not disclose the identity of the writer but said ""it did not come from a political or from a business-related source.""","Sammy Ofer was 89 .

"Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington (CNN) -- ""The plan was to kill people."" That's what Army Spc. Jeremy Morlock said Wednesday moments after he pleaded guilty at a court-martial proceeding to killing Afghan civilians in 2010. Lt. Col. Kwasi Hawks, the military judge in the case, had asked Morlock if he and fellow soldiers just meant to scare civilians with grenades and gunfire and it ""got out of hand."" Morlock, 22, and four other soldiers who face murder charges are accused of killing Afghan citizens for sport. Seven more soldiers are accused of helping cover up the killings. Morlock also pleaded guilty to drug charges. He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he struck another soldier and that he photographed and possessed photos of dead Afghans. Morlock was charged with three counts of murder. Hawks accepted Morlock's guilty plea, but sentencing will take place later. The defendant addressed the court, saying, ""I want to apologize to the families of my victims, the people of Afghanistan and my fellow soldiers."" The Wasilla, Alaska, native said he has been reflecting ""on how I lost my moral compass."" Morlock told the judge he pleaded guilty in hopes of receiving a lesser sentence. The defendant, who could have been sentenced to life in military prison without the possibility of parole, agreed to testify against other soldiers. Morlock must now serve the remainder of a 24-year prison sentence and could be paroled in seven years. The judge counted the year Morlock has already spent in confinement toward his sentence and parole eligibility date. Morlock's attorney, Frank Spinner, told the court his client ""has admitted responsibility for what he did."" ""No one takes pleasure in testifying against others,"" Spinner said. ""He plans to testify truthfully."" Morlock was accused of killing one Afghan civilian in January 2010 with a grenade and rifle; killing another in May 2010 in a similar manner; and shooting a third to death in February 2010. Another soldier, Pfc. Andrew Holmes, also faces charges in the case, but a start date for his court-martial has not been publicly announced. In all, officials charged 12 U.S. soldiers in what they called a conspiracy to kill Afghan civilians and cover it up, along with charges they mutilated corpses and kept grisly souvenirs. Morlock was the first of the five to face an Article 32 hearing, the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Holmes is charged with the premeditated deaths of three civilians, possessing a dismembered human finger, wrongfully possessing photographs of human casualties and smoking hashish. He is also accused of conspiring with Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. All the accused men were members of a 2nd Infantry Division brigade operating near Kandahar in southern Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010. The three others facing murder charges are Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs, of Billings, Montana; Adam Winfield, of Cape Coral, Florida; and Spc. Michael Wagnon, of Las Vegas. Authorities allege Gibbs kept finger bones, leg bones and a tooth from Afghan corpses. Wagnon allegedly kept a skull from a corpse, according to charging documents. Several soldiers are charged with taking pictures of the corpses, and one soldier is charged with stabbing a corpse. This week, German news outlet Der Spiegel published photographs of what they identified as Morlock and Holmes posing over the bodies of dead Afghans. Two images show the soldiers kneeling by a bloody body sprawled over a patch of sand and grass. A third shows what appears to be two bodies propped up, back to back, against a post in front of a military vehicle. The U.S. Army released a statement Monday calling the photographs ""repugnant to us as human beings and contrary to the standards and values of the United States Army."" ""We apologize for the distress these photos cause,"" the statement said. Army officials asserted in the statement that ongoing court-martial proceedings related to the alleged atrocities ""speak for themselves."" ""The photos appear in stark contrast to the discipline, professionalism and respect that have characterized our soldiers' performance during nearly 10 years of sustained operations.""","NEW: Soldier's possible life without parole sentence cut to 24 years in plea deal .

"(CNN) -- Jurors in the capital murder trial of Casey Anthony had a front-row seat this week to the vivid yet imaginary world the Florida mother created in the weeks after 2-year-old daughter Caylee disappeared in 2008. The jury heard detailed stories from her mother, her brother and finally, Anthony herself, of her business trips to Tampa and visits to an old flame that later proved to be false. Through recordings of Anthony's police interviews, jailhouse visits and a 911 call, the silent woman at the defense table finally spoke. Throughout the conversations, one sentiment is conveyed to Anthony again and again: stop lying, or face the worst of consequences. Florida prosecutors say the lies did not end, and now Anthony could face the death penalty. She is charged with seven counts, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and misleading police in the 2008 death of daughter Caylee. The last time the little girl was seen was June 16, 2008. She was not reported missing until July 15, 2008, by Cindy Anthony, Casey Anthony's mother. Her body was found in December 2008, in a wooded area less than a mile from the Anthony family home in eastern Orange County. Anthony, 25, has denied harming her daughter or having anything to do with the little girl's disappearance or death. Her lawyer has said that once all the facts were known, it will become clear his client is innocent. In a July 16, 2008, police interview, which the jury heard Thursday, Orange County Sheriff's Sgt. John Allen told Anthony the time had come to reveal the truth. ""By burying this ... you are not going to get yourself to a better place, OK,"" Allen said. ""What you're going to do is you're going to cause everybody else around you to suffer. And at some point this is going to come out; it always does."" After arrest, Casey Anthony insisted focus was on finding Caylee . Anthony heard the same sentiment again during in a jailhouse phone call to her mother, also on July 16, 2008. When Anthony blames her mother for her being in jail, Cindy Anthony fights back. ""Well, whose fault is your sitting in the jail?"" she asked her daughter. ""Blame yourself for telling lies."" The excuses . Testimony earlier in the trial, which began last week in Clearwater, Florida, revealed that Anthony lied to her parents and avoided them for 31 days in the summer of 2008 while Caylee was supposedly missing. This week, jurors learned more about what Anthony told her parents during that time and what she was actually doing. From the witness stand Tuesday, Anthony's mother described heated confrontations with her daughter on July 15, 2008, after she learned she had been lying about her whereabouts for a month. Those stories began with Anthony saying she was having a sleepover with a nanny named Zenaida ""Zanny"" Gonzalez. Then, Anthony was out of town on a work trip to Tampa. By the fourth week, Anthony's story was that she was out of town visiting an old boyfriend named Jeffrey Michael Hopkins. Cindy Anthony caught her daughter in her lies by discovering she was, in fact, in Orlando with a different boyfriend. By the time her mother called 911 to report Caylee mising, Anthony had a new story. ""I know who has her. She's been my nanny for about a year-and-a-half, almost two years,"" Anthony told the operator in the July 15, 2008, call, which jurors heard Tuesday. When asked by the operator why she waited so long to report her daughter missing, Casey replied, ""I have been looking for her and have gone through other resources to try to find her, which was stupid."" The characters . In the following days, Gonzalez's alleged role would expand from an occasionally mentioned nanny to a central character in Caylee's disappearance. When initially questioned by Orange County Detective Yuri Melich on July 16, 2008, about Gonzalez, Anthony provided a description of her without hesitation. That interview was played Wednesday. Anthony said she'd known Zanny for four years after they met working together at Universal Studios. She provided a physical description of Gonzalez, her address, even her mother's name. Other characters were also fleshed out. Hopkins, a former Universal Studios co-worker, according to Casey, lived in Jacksonville and had a son named Zachary who played with Caylee. And then there was Juliette Lewis, another co-worker at Universal, who now lived in New York, Anthony said. She also had a daughter Caylee's age. Anthony claimed she called Lewis and Hopkins when she realized Caylee was missing. But prosecutors claim Anthony was not looking for her daughter in the month she was missing. Instead, she was staying with her boyfriend, spending time in Orlando with friends, attending parties, going shopping and hitting nightclubs, according to testimony from friends, her former boyfriend, and acquaintances, who also said that she did not mention her daughter being missing during that time. Anthony's frustration level with her parents, particularly her mother, was rising around the time Caylee disappeared, friend Amy Huizenga testified Tuesday. Friend: Casey Anthony was 'frustrated' with mother . ""I remember she told me her mom had told her she was an unfit mother. She was extremely upset about that."" But Anthony also was agitated at her mother because she had to cancel plans ""fairly frequently"" when no one was available to watch her daughter, Huizenga testified. In late June, Huizenga said, Anthony told her that she was keeping Caylee away from her parents, as they were having marital problems and were considering divorce, and ""she wanted to keep Caylee out of the drama."" 'Fessing up . On Thursday, Melich described the day Anthony was finally forced to admit her lies, at least in part. On July 16, 2008, Melich worked with Universal Studios to scour the employee database. Anthony was in the database, but she hadn't been affiliated with Universal for years. Melich also found no record of Gonzalez or Lewis. A Jeffrey Hopkins was found, but never worked for the company at the same time as Casey. Gonzalez's supposed apartment had also been found vacant. Anthony voluntarily met Melich at Universal Studios to discuss the matter. Melich testified Thursday that he watched Anthony try to enter the park without a badge then attempted to lead him to her office before being forced to admit she didn't have one. ""I can tell you just for certainty everything you've told me so far has been a lie,"" Melich said in a recorded interview played for the jury on Thursday. ""I've gone to every address that you've told me. I've looked up every name, I've talked to every person that you wanted me to talk or try to. And found out all these names you're giving me are people that either never worked here or been fired a long time ago, OK."" Anthony conceded she didn't work at Universal and that the people she had described as her co-workers did not exist. Yet she continued to blame Gonzalez for the disappearance of her child. The breakdown: Casey Anthony's ""imaginary friends"" Cindy Anthony said her daughter had been telling her about Gonzalez along with numerous other people -- a boyfriend, a co-worker and a man named Eric Baker, whom she believed to be Caylee's father -- for years before Caylee went missing. At the time, she said, she never had a reason to believe those people were fictitious. ""I just found out they were imaginary people,"" she testified. A Zenaida Gonzalez was later found, but she had no affiliation with Anthony aside from having filled out a guest card at the Orlando apartment complex where Anthony claimed the nanny lived. The apartment where Anthony said Gonzalez lived was found to be vacant, and there was no record of Gonzalez in the Universal Studios employee database. As week two concludes, it now appears Allen was right in his prediction that Anthony's stories ultimately would lead to suffering for others. However, it is yet to be seen whether the second part of his prophecy will be realized: that the truth will come out.","Jury learns of lies Anthony told parents regarding whereabouts during crucial month .

"(CNN) -- Australians are demanding a ban on cattle exports to Indonesia after an investigation revealed brutal treatment that included animals getting flogged, kicked and bleeding to death in some cases. The call comes after an investigation by an Australian animal rights group, which followed the cattle from the docks to 11 abattoirs in Indonesia. Animals Australia conducted the probe after a livestock industry report revealed mistreatment, according to Glenys Oogjes of the animal rights group. It openly filmed inside 11 abattoirs, including at night, with the help of Indonesian workers at the slaughterhouses, Oogjes said. ""Our primary goal was to have a look and see what we were reading in industry reports and to find out if it was as bad as it sounded,"" she said. ""Our goal was to expose to the Australian community what's happening to our live stock in Indonesia, and to stop our animals from being treated badly and to halt the trade to Indonesia."" ""It was really unfortunate if it really happened,"" said Djajadi, director of the Veterinary Health Department of the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture, adding, ""Australian cattle is different from Indonesian cattle. They're big and wild."" But, he said, ""We already have plans to put the slaughter houses in order, to ensure the animals' welfare, by giving restraining boxes for slaughtering, stun guns for slaughtering houses, training and education for the workers."" The footage, broadcast on Australian television, showed cattle being flogged and taking minutes to die after their necks were slashed, according to the rights group. In addition to the mistreatment, the cattle are not treated in accordance with the Muslim practice of halal, Oogjes said. ""Animals are supposed to be treated well and should be facing Mecca when they are slaughtered. Our investigation discovered that neither of these things were happening,"" Oogjes said. She said the rights group ""filmed animals being slaughtered and cut up in front of other animals -- that's certainly not halal."" The footage sparked angry calls to the agriculture department and tens of thousands of signatures in an online petition. Opposition parties, farmers, animals rights groups and outraged citizens have demanded a ban on Indonesian cattle exports,  Oogjes said. On Wednesday, the Australian veterinary association joined calls for a suspension of trade to Indonesia until humane slaughter practices are established. Australia's agriculture minister has appointed someone to look into the situation,  Oogjes said. ""He has said this week the cattle won't be sent to the 11 abattoirs investigated by Animals Australia,""  Oogjes said. ""But it's ridiculous. There are thousands of abattoirs in Indonesia and we don't have any control over where our animals go in Indonesia."" Animal rights groups called on Prime Minister Julia Gillard to urgently halt cattle exports to Indonesia. ""While the government could deny knowledge of what's going on in Indonesia this time around -- if we have to go back and document further evidence -- the public will not be so forgiving,""  Oogjes said in a statement. CNN's Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","Animals Australia conducts a probe after a livestock industry report .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- One of the world's largest concrete pumps is being readied to get on a massive cargo plane and head to Japan, all part of the effort to address the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The 190,000-pound truck pump was moved off a job on the Savannah River on Wednesday and, two days later, was in Hanahan, South Carolina. Once preparations are complete, it will head about 7,000 miles toward Asia aboard a Russian Antonov 225 cargo plane, which is considered among the world's biggest aircrafts. The U.S. Department of Energy had been using the big pumper at a mixed oxide fuel plant construction site in southeastern Georgia. Eventually, nuclear waste is to be disposed of here. But the decision was made to transfer it to Japan -- along with several other such large pumps, from around the world -- in order to deal with a disaster that has been brewing since a March 11 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc at the plant and stoked fears about massive releases of radiation. ""I use the pump every day at the river site, but they're trying to avert a situation that worsens each day,"" said Jerry Ashmore, the owner of Ashmore Concrete Contractors that supplies concrete for the Savannah River facility. ""They need all this equipment. They need help."" Company officials say the prep work should be done by this weekend. Then, Georgia's transportation department must sign off on necessary highway and bridge permits, which are required due to the pumper truck's immensity. Eventually, it will be driven south to Atlanta, to be ideally flown out of the country by next Friday. Ashmore didn't have all the details about how the concrete pump will be used once it gets to Japan, though he understood its first mission will be to pump water into the stricken facility's reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools to prevent overheating and the further emission of radioactive material. ""I understand it will be used to pump water into the reactor and later they can use it for concrete operations that need to be done,"" said Ashmore. The big pump, one of a handful of such trucks built by the the German company Putzmeister, appears to be tailor-made for this type of project -- especially in a radioactive environment. Its 70-meter boom can be controlled remotely, which should allow it to disperse cooling water in pinpointed locations over a large distance, say experts. Typically trucks this massive are used in large projects using concrete, such as the construction of bridges or high-rise buildings. According to Putzmeister's website, the company has already re-directed a truck-mounted concrete pump from an unknown location in Southeast Asia to head to the Fukushima Daiichi site, which is 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Another smaller Putzmeister pumper, currently in Los Angeles, is also being readied to fly to Japan. This is not the first time the German company's large concrete pumps have been utilized to help address a nuclear crisis. In 1986, 11 Putzmeister concrete pumps were used after the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, then a part of the Soviet Union. The reactors' core were encased in massive amounts of concrete, to prevent the further release of any more radiation.","A 190,000-pound truck pump is now in South Carolina, being prepped to fly out of Atlanta .

"(CNN)  -- Roger Federer made it five straight wins in a row as he reached the semifinals of the French Open Tuesday at the expense of home favorite Gael Monfils. The third seed clinched a 6-4 6-3 7-6 victory on his third match point after two hours and 34 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier. It set up a mouthwatering semifinal clash with second seed Novak Djokovic, who received a quarterfinal bye when his Italian opponent Fabio Fognini pulled out with a thigh muscle injury. 16-time grand slam champion Federer has enjoyed an untroubled passage to his sixth French Open semifinal at Roland Garros and apart from falling an early break of service down was rarely extended by Monfils. Federer recovered to level before clinching the opener and quickly broke twice to take command in the second. Monfils retrieved one of the breaks but Federer served out at 5-3 to take a comfortable two-set lead. Monfils had won their last meeting but never looked capable of repeating the feat despite offering stiff resistance in the third set where he hit back to level after falling behind again. But in the tiebreak Federer raced into a big lead to secure five match points and wrapped it up with a forehand down the line. A far stiffer test awaits the Swiss ace Friday with Djokovic unbeaten this year and set to be crowned as new world number one if he can beat Federer. ""Playing a semi-final here at Roland Garros is a great moment and playing such a great player is what we train for,"" Federer said in a court side interview after beating Monfils. In other men's action Tuesday, Britain's Andy Murray conjured up another recovery act to beat Victor Troicki of Serbia to earn his place in the quarterfinals. The match was held over from Monday night at two sets all and fourth seed Murray fell 5-2 down in the decider before mounting a stirring recovery. He eventually closed out a 4-6 4-6 6-3 6-2 7-5 victory and will next play Argentina's Juan Ignacio Chela. Murray beat him at Roland Garros in both 2009 and 2010 but has been battling an ankle sprain from an earlier match. ""The problem is if you go over on the ankle again,"" Murray told AFP. ""That's the danger because obviously it's weak just now... It's one thing I have to be careful with. Going over on it again would be an issue.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The U.S. government has confirmed the killing of al Qaeda operational commander Ilyas Kashmiri,  the prime minister of Pakistan said Monday. ""The U.S. has confirmed that Ilyas Kashmiri was killed on Friday,"" said Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani at a Monday press conference in Quetta, the capital of the country's southwestern province of Balochistan. Gilani did not explain how he knew the United States had confirmed the death of the man described by counterterrorism officials as al Qaeda's ""military brain."" A spokesman for Kashmiri's jihadist group, Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, previously said Kashmiri was killed, along with some aides, in a strike late Friday night. Kashmiri's death is the first major kill or capture since Osama Bin Laden, and the highest profile drone target since Beitullah Mehsud in 2009. It could also be seen as an embarrassment for Pakistanis, who have twice in just over one month, had a major al Qaeda figure killed on their territory without their participation. U.S. drones now operate entirely autonomously in Pakistan, a Pakistani intelligence source has told CNN. Whereas before the United States cooperated with Pakistan and used their intelligence, today, the Americans have an intelligence network that allows them to go after terrorists unilaterally. Kashmiri, a veteran jihadist, was considered one of the most dangerous men in the world by counterterrorism officials on three continents. He was commander of ""Brigade 313"" of Harakat-ul-Jihad-Islami, which has formed a close relationship with al Qaeda. Kashmiri was also said to have ties with David Coleman Headley, the U.S. citizen who confessed to helping scout targets for the Mumbai attack in November 2008.","Kashmiri was seen at the location of the strike .

"Berlin (CNN) -- Germany's government formally approved a plan Monday to close all the country's nuclear power plants by 2022. The plan was announced last month, after the government rethought Germany's nuclear strategy in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown triggered by an earthquake and tsunami. Parliament must still officially approve the bill. Minister of Ecology Norbert Roettgen of the Christian Democratic Union party said eight nuclear power stations would remain shut down, while six more would go offline by by the of 2021 ""at the latest,"" and ""the three most modern, newest nuclear plants will go offline in 2022 at the latest."" He made the announcement after negotiations with coalition partner, the Liberal Party, which had been opposed to setting a date for decommissioning the nuclear facilities. Opposition parties have long supported shuttering nuclear energy in Germany . To make up for the loss of nuclear energy, the German government will begin to switch to renewable energy and increase investments in energy research, the government website said. ""But we will not be able to do without conventional power plants, above all cutting-edge gas power plants for a long time,"" said a statement published in May. ""New fruits of new research should contribute to making the energy transition more efficient and easier on the ecology."" In March, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced she would rethink a plan to extend the lifespan of her country's nuclear power plants. ""The events in Japan have shown us that even things that seem all but impossible scientifically can in fact happen,"" Merkel said at a Berlin news conference. Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was damaged in a March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which has spewed large amounts of radiation into the environment. At the time, Merkel ordered a review of the nuclear plant safety standards, saying there would be ""no taboos in those reviews.""","The cabinet votes to shut down all nuclear power plants by 2022 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A protester opposed to the expansion of Heathrow Airport threw green custard in the face of British Business Secretary Peter Mandelson on Friday. Mandelson: ""Thankfully, it wasn't paint and I've come through it intact."" Mandelson had just stepped out of his car for a meeting on carbon emissions when the woman threw the cup of custard at him. She shouted a few words at Mandelson, who rushed inside the building, before walking away. London's Metropolitan Police said it did not arrest the woman because ""no complaint has been made as yet."" Plane Stupid, a group that opposes airport expansion and aviation-related climate change, identified the protester as Leila Deen, 29. ""It's not right that someone like Peter Mandelson can stand up and talk about being green. The only thing green about Peter Mandelson is the slime coursing through his veins,"" said Deen, who said she works at a poverty charity. Deen disguised the custard in a disposable coffee cup with a lid. ""It was a grave decision that I had to take to highlight this, but we cannot have people like Peter Mandelson standing by and being applauded for his actions on climate change when he's agreed to the third runway and bullied others into that,"" she added. Mandelson indicated that Deen failed to make her point. ""She was so busy throwing what seemed like green soup or something in my face that she failed to tell me what the protest was about,"" he said.

The government has promised noise and emission levels will actually be reduced as Britain meets European Union targets. Heathrow currently operates at 99 percent capacity. The runway's construction would involve razing areas around the airport, including an entire village and parts of two other towns. Opponents say emission levels will actually increase under the plans.","Protester throws green custard over UK Business Secretary Peter Mandelson .

"(CNN) -- The legend of Jesus Malverde is a more than century-old story  handed down from generation to generation of disenfranchised Mexicans. Widely known as the Robin Hood of Mexico, Malverde was said to be the quintessential son of the pueblo. His story was embraced by the poor and, more recently, by drug traffickers. They worship the folk hero as a type of secular saint. Malverde's name has become so inextricably linked with drug trafficking that busts and other paraphernalia of him have been used as evidence against defendants in drug trials. For Latino hip-hop star Jesus Martinez-Gonzalez, that presents some problems. As a musician he performs under the stage name ""Malverde."" Since he can remember, he's crafted his image after his boyhood hero. A photo on one of his social media sites shows just how much. In one picture, Martinez-Gonzalez is dressed in a traditional white Mexican button-up, his usual beard shaved into a thin mustache, a strikingly similar pose to how Malverde is portrayed. The musician has also embraced activism, taking the side of the disenfranchised, something he says Malverde would have done. If that wasn't enough, he even introduces himself to people as ""Jesus Malverde."" Martinez-Gonzalez says he was fascinated with the mystical folklore and was not aware of the negative perception of Malverde. But as drug violence plagues parts of Mexico, the stigma has forced the musician to reconsider what he's created for himself. ""It's crazy, I get messages and e-mails from people who think I'm really him,"" Martinez-Gonzalez said in an interview at the Center for Hispanic Leadership conference in Los Angeles. Watch Martinez-Gonzalez music video . The messages come sporadically on his social media pages, he said. And because he lives with a tainted name, some of the messages are threats. ""I get people that hit me up,"" he said about the threats, ""but once they realize what I'm about they're cool,"" he said without elaborating. Tony Kail, creator of Worldview Consulting, which helps train U.S. law enforcement staff about religious practices, said the cartels embraced figures like Jesus Malverde because they ""hear prayers from dark places -- prayers traditional deities like the Mother Mary don't."" A shrine dedicated to Malverde is located in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico. It is believed thousands visit it every year to give offerings to the ""narco saint."" People leave messages pleading for miracles. When they believe those miracles materialize, they return with more offerings. Kail spent more than 20 years writing about deviant religious groups, researching Santeria communities and healers in East Africa. He said in the 1980s, he began seeing anti-Christian imagery in Mexico. He saw images of Santa Muerte, the protector of death. Later, he saw Santa Muerte's image tied to one figure who kept coming up. It was Jesus Malverde. Unlike traditional Mexican Catholicism, there is no hard and fast ritual to worshipping figures like Malverde or Santa Muerte, Kail said. That made those figures spiritually attractive to nefarious people, including drug traffickers. So, the folk hero became inextricably linked with a dark business. Martinez-Gonzalez chose the name innocently. The son of a Mexican immigrant grape picker, he spent childhood summers running through the grapevines of Southern California's Coachella Valley, side by side with his mother while she worked. Being first-generation Mexican-American he kept close ties to his culture, listening intently to the stories his grandfather told him growing up. The story about Jesus Malverde caught his attention. For the young Martinez-Gonzalez, sharing the first name with a railroad bandito legend was ""pretty cool,"" but what appealed to him more were the stories of Malverde's philanthropy and how he made his legend by helping the poor hard-working families in the western state of Sinaloa, Mexico. Unlike his contemporary -- the more politically minded legendary Mexican hero Pancho Villa -- there is no proof Malverde existed. Those who perpetuate the legend speak of a man who was the ""son of the pueblo"" during the turn of the 20th century. Mexican authorities were said to have hunted the elusive Malverde relentlessly and then offered a sizeable reward for his capture -- dead or alive. As the legend goes, Malverde told his friend to kill him, turn his body in and give the reward money to the people of Sinaloa. In the years after his purported death in 1909, and as his legend was repeated over time by poor Mexican farm workers, those who paid homage to Malverde grew in numbers. With the rise of drug culture in rural Sinaloa between the 1970s and '80s, Malverde's image morphed into something less benevolent. ""There's a seriousness involved to the name I chose,"" Martinez-Gonzalez said. ""I understand that."" But he defended his decision with the argument that Malverde's legend had nothing to do with narco-trafficking. Then, he paused, understanding the sensitivity of what he just said. ""It's not like I'm out there saying stupid stuff. The bandito music is about love and the street and the struggle,"" Malverde said, referring to ""bandit music,"" which glamorizes illegitimate lifestyles and is seen by its critics as praising thug life. ""My music has a moral to it. When I started 10-plus years or so ago, the stigma wasn't as bad as it is now. I'm not redefining the brand because it is what it is. It's others (who) have redefined it and made it something else."" Martinez-Gonzalez entered high school in California, where he also went to college. He embraced political activism. He began writing poetry, listening to hip-hop and attending pro-immigration rallies. At political functions, he contributed through spoken word poetry. It turned into rap and from there he started writing music. He was good and was soon signed by Universal Latino as a recording artist. ""Eventually I got to a point where people were like, you need a name,"" he said. Almost instinctively, he chose the name Jesus Malverde. On a serendipitous day, he was talking to his producer about whether he should go with the name when a Mexican healer on the streets of Los Angeles handed his producer a card. On it was the image of Jesus Malverde with the Virgin Mary behind him. ""That was my green light,"" Martinez-Gonzalez said. ""I believe in signs. I went to Catholic school first through fifth grade,"" Martinez-Gonzalez said, laughing on the phone while at a studio in Los Angeles. Just to be sure he wasn't making a mistake, he met with the healer. She gave him her blessing. He did not foresee the dark drug cloud that hung over him. Former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Tony Garza said it was the outlaw spirit of Malverde's image that appeals to the narcos. ""Him being a mytho-secular saint probably had plenty to do with these guys looking for a talisman of sorts for today and a guide into the here- and ever-after tomorrow,"" Garza said. Kail, the FBI consultant, said the cartels chose figures like Malverde to make them scapegoats through demonization. ""It was the process of the cartels attaching themselves to the Malverde image that is shocking and anti-traditional and now it has taken a life of its own,"" Kail said. Martinez-Gonzalez said the drug traffickers feel they are emulating the legacy of Malverde. ""And in a way they are,"" he said. ""But then there's the other aspect. The level of violence. Dishonorable killings. It's tragic in that sense that it's taken such a negative, nasty turn."" Beyond the more than 100 Google page search results on the narco culture ties to Jesus Malverde, Martinez-Gonzalez said anyone can find the real legend of the folklore hero. It is his struggle, he said, to shed the misconceptions of Malverde created over time. ""I'm involved in major nonprofits and community education. And they see someone in me who has overcome being in the barrio. To me, that's Malverde. The experience of instilling that hope. If Malverde was alive right now, I try to think what would he be doing?"" But carrying the ""Malverde cross"" became so burdensome that Martinez-Gonzalez subconsciously turned away from the name altogether. A year ago he stopped playing music under his stage name and left Universal Latino, choosing to focus instead on a collaboration he calls the Maleco Collective, an eclectic mix of Spanish language politically driven hip-hop. The whole time, though, Martinez-Gonzalez said he looked for signs to perform again under the name Malverde. ""Here's a man, whether he existed or not, 100 years later still has such an impact,"" he said, referencing the popular Mexican ballads known as corridos. ""He's immortal. Like my grandfather says, you leave a good 'corrido'. And my music is my 'corrido'. It's the power of the word."" Martinez-Gonzalez knows the gravity of the name he adopted. People have gotten killed for less, he said. But Malverde, he said, will always exist in him. And, he said, ""he exists in you.""","Legendary Jesus Malverde is a kind of Mexican Robin Hood .
He has become like a secular saint to drug traffickers .

"(CNN) -- Radamel Falcao fired four goals as Porto demolished Villarreal 5-1 on Thursday night to all-but ensure an all-Portuguese final in the Europa League. The Spanish club took the lead through Ruben Cani just before halftime after dominating the opening period, but had no answer in the second spell against the Portuguese champions. Colombia striker Falcao extended his competition-leading tally to 15 this season, matching German legend Jurgen Klinsmann's record total in Europe's second-tier competition, while Fredy Guarin scored the other goal. Porto, who won the tournament in 2003 when it was still known as the UEFA Cup, will face either Benfica or Braga in next month's final in Dublin if they successfully negotiate the trip to El Madrigal. Benfica clinched a 2-1 victory at home, leaving the second semifinal evenly poised ahead of next week's return leg in Braga. Is Mourinho student the new 'Special One'? Villarreal, fourth in Spain's La Liga, had looked surprisingly comfortable away from home against a team that wrapped up the national league crown with five games to play -- and whose coach has everyone comparing him to his mentor Jose Mourinho. Andre Villas Boas could only look on as Ruben Cani headed Villarreal in front with a near-post effort from Nilmar's cross as Porto's defense was caught out again. But whatever the 33-year-old said at halftime, it did the trick as his team ran riot. Falcao equalized from the penalty spot three minutes after the break after being brought down by Diego Lopez, then just after an hour Fredy Guarin headed in a rebound after his first effort was pushed onto the post by the goalkeeper. Falcao made it 3-1 in the 67th minute as he lunged to volley in a perfect cross from Brazilian striker partner Hulk, then his diving header from Guarin's free-kick on 75 made it a three-goal advantage. The 25-year-old gave Villarreal a mountain to climb in the second leg with another stunning header from a corner in the final minute, sealing Porto's 13th successive victory in all competitions. Villas Boas is on course for a treble in his first season in charge, which Mourinho also achieved in 2003-04, with Porto also in the Portuguese Cup final. Benfica, a distant second in the league by 19 points and beaten 3-1 by Porto in the domestic cup last week, made a strong start against Braga as Oscar Cardozo had an 11th-minute effort ruled out for offside. And the Paraguay striker was involved when his team took the lead five minutes after halftime, with his header hitting the post after a superb run down the right by Argentine defender Maxi Pereira. Vieira Jardel converted the rebound for his first European goal. Braga, third in the Portuguese league a whopping 33 points behind Porto, stunned the home fans just three minutes later when midfielder Vandinho leveled. The 33-year-old Brazilian cleverly flicked in a header from a free-kick to leave goalkeeper Roberto helpless. It was a double blow for Benfica as the set-piece came from a foul by Argentine midfielder Pablo Aimar, who will now miss the second leg after being booked for his efforts. But Cardozo ensured two-time European champions Benfica will at least have a lead to protect, with the 27-year-old curling in a superb left-foot free-kick just before the hour mark. Earlier on Thursday, UEFA fined Rangers €80,000 ($118,000) and banned the Scottish club from selling tickets at two away games and one at home. The punishment stems from incidents during both legs of the Europa League last-16 tie against Dutch side PSV Eindhoven, with Rangers fans accused of ""discriminatory behavior"" -- or sectarian chants by the club's predominantly Catholic support. It is the third time UEFA has fined the Glasgow-based team for such an offense following incidents in European competition in 2006, 2007 and 2009, according the the UK Press Association. The ticket ban for one away match and the home one has been suspended for a probationary period of three years. Rangers have three days in which to appeal, and the club's chief executive Martin Bain said he would first wait for a written explanation from UEFA. ""We are bitterly disappointed that our club has been placed in a position where we are subjected to these kind of sanctions by UEFA,"" he told the Rangers website. ""The club put its own case very forcibly to UEFA, and the more draconian sanctions that were recommended by the disciplinary inspector have been mitigated to a degree. ""To be clear, we condemn sectarianism and there is no doubt the mindless behavior of an element of our support has exposed the club to a very serious situation. The people who engage in this type of behavior are damaging the club they claim to support.""","Porto poised for Europa League final after thrashing Villarreal 5-1 in home leg .

And thanks to all of you for rapping up -- get it? -- your week with CNN Student News. First Up: Southern Storms . AZUZ: Unparalleled, near-epic, heartbreaking. Those are just some of the words officials are using to describe the severe weather and the impact that it had as it ripped across parts of the southern U.S. on Wednesday. We've been talking about storms in the south for a few days now. The devastation that happened on Wednesday was immense. Across six states, more than 270 people were killed. Whole neighborhoods destroyed. Governors declaring states of emergency and asking President Obama to do the same thing. Most of the deaths happened in Alabama. This video gives you an idea of just how frightening it was to be in parts of that state on Wednesday. This tornado hit Tuscaloosa. That's where the University of Alabama is located. Officials say the school wasn't hit too badly. Nnot the case for other parts of the town. Tuscaloosa's mayor said, ""I don't know how anyone survived."" He added, ""We're used to tornadoes here in Tuscaloosa. But when you look at the path of destruction... there's parts of the city I don't recognize."" No question about it, these storms were strong. As it turns out, you're more likely to get more powerful storms when there aren't a lot in one area. Yesterday, Chad Myers explained the science behind that. CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: When you have a bunch of storms that are all banging into each other, you don't get F-4, F-5 tornadoes. When you have a storm all by itself, like we had a couple of them yesterday, here, here, here, here, not battling tops, all by themselves, that's when you get this type of structure.

As a noun, it means an effort, an action or activity designed to achieve a goal. ENDEAVOR . That's the word! Endeavour Launch . AZUZ: The space shuttle Endeavour is getting ready to set off on a new endeavor. You might notice that the shuttle's name is spelled differently. That's because it's named after a British ship, not after the word. Endeavour is scheduled to launch later today. The mission to the international space station will be commanded by Mark Kelly. His wife will be at the Kennedy Space Center to watch the liftoff. That's newsworthy, because his wife is U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was the victim of a shooting less than four months ago. The two-week mission is the last one for Endeavour. As it gets ready to take its last flight, John Zarrella looks back at the first time Endeavour lifted off. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN MIAMI BUREAU CHIEF AND CORRESPONDENT: Endeavour, the newest of the orbiters, might never have been built if not for a terrible accident. In the aftermath of the loss of Challenger in 1986, President Reagan promised the disaster would not stop the journey outward. FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: We will continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews. ZARRELLA: A year and a half later, Congress authorized the construction of the new, nearly $2 billion space plane. Endeavour's first flight, 1992. UNIDENTIFED NASA ANNOUNCER: Liftoff of the maiden voyage of Endeavour... ZARRELLA: This will be its 25th and final flight. Along its journey, Endeavour made numerous construction trips to the international space station and handled the first Hubble Telescope repair mission. Barbara Morgan, the first educator in space, flew on Endeavour. Morgan was the back-up to teacher-in-space Christa McAuliffe, who died on Challenger. The shuttle fleet has had both a tragic and triumphant past. And for thirty years, has been America's signature flying machine. COL. MIKE FINCKE, ENDEAVOUR ASTRONAUT: It's got a glass cockpit. It has a robot arm. It can fly to the Hubble Space Telescope or the station. It can land anywhere on the planet that has a runway. It is an amazing piece of equipment on any scale. ZARRELLA: When Endeavour returns from its final flight, Commander Mark Kelly jokes, there won't be anything missing. MARK KELLY, ENDEAVOUR COMMANDER: You know, when you fly an airplane to the boneyard out in the desert, they say don't take anything off of it. You get the brief ahead of time. I'll do the same thing with my crew: ""You got to leave, make sure it all stays intact for the museum."" We're not gonna be signing our name on anything. ZARRELLA: Perhaps just the guest book at the California Science Center, where Endeavour will be placed in retirement. John Zarrella, CNN, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

You've got three seconds -- GO! Prince William and Kate Middleton are exchanging vows at Westminster Abbey. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Royal Wedding . AZUZ: Westminster Abbey is a popular choice for royal weddings. That's where Queen Elizabeth II was married 63 years ago. Before William and Kate set foot in the Abbey this morning, though, people were lining up on the streets of London hoping to catch a glimpse of the couple on their way to Westminster. At CNNStudentNews.com, you'll find CNN's Royal Wedding Planner. Check out the guest list, the seating chart for the Abbey, the royal wedding family tree. There's been a ton of media focus on the wedding, especially here in the U.S., a country that fought for its independence from Great Britain. Kiran Chetry looks at how a revolution eventually gave way to a special relationship between the two nations. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAVID WOOLNER, HISTORIAN, ROOSEVELT INSTITUTE: It's that summer of '39 that you see the beginning of the birth of this special relationship that's been with us ever since. KIRAN CHETRY, CNN ANCHOR: At the time, the spotlight on another royal couple: King George and Queen Elizabeth. The special relationship with the United States begins with letters between the king and President Franklin Roosevelt. And soon after, a visit; the first time a reigning British monarch tours the U.S. WOOLNER: This visit then comes at a very critical moment. War is imminent. Roosevelt was looking for a way to strengthen U.S. bonds with Great Britain. Especially the bonds between the American people and the British people. CHETRY: Not long after, Winston Churchill is the first to use the phrase ""special relationship,"" as the two countries fight together during World War II. A sentiment often repeated by other prime ministers and presidents throughout the years. GORDON BROWN, FORMER BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I come in friendship to renew for new times our special relationship. CHETRY: Why is that relationship so special? BROWN: It didn't start very well 225 years ago when you kicked the British out. But I think this shared purpose, the same values of liberty, democracy, responsibility to each other, fairness. CHETRY: Yet, the special relationship has not been without strains. The United States would not support Great Britain during the 1956 Suez Canal crisis, and Great Britain refused to support the United States during the Vietnam War. BROWN: We can have treaties that are broken, but this relationship, it seems to me, is unbreakable, because it is based on something more than just sort of an assessment of your best interests. CHETRY: Close ties between the two countries often correspond with the bonds of friendship between the leaders: Prime Minister Harold McMillan and President John F. Kennedy fighting the Cold War. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan, united during the fall of the Soviet Union. But Prime Minister Tony Blair's support of President George Bush's decision to invade Iraq was not without consequences. WOOLNER: This became very, very unpopular, of course, among the British public. And Tony Blair paid a price for this politically and is still paying a price for this to this day. CHETRY: But as the two countries move forward, former Prime Minister Brown takes an optimistic view. BROWN: Despite all the different problems that will arise, this relationship will endure and, perhaps, strengthen in the years to come. (END VIDEO) Before We Go .

"(CNN) -- The death of Osama bin Laden proves that he had been ""hiding in plain sight"" says CNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson. The U.S. special forces operation that killed bin Laded took place at a mansion in the town of Abbottabad, just over 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the Pakistan capital Islamabad. ""This has been exactly the concern of western officials; that he had been hiding not in a remote border area but in the cities."" The death of bin Laden in Pakistan there will present some difficulties for the government there, said Robertson. ""It's been one of the most difficult and thorniest issues (for the government), what happened if bin Laden is killed on their soil? ""It would not be difficult to imagine there would be some sort of backlash or protests on the streets there of Islamabad."" The death of bin Laden comes at a time when relations between the U.S. and Pakistan are particularly strained with Pakistani officials angered by U.S. drone strikes in the country. The case of Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor who fatally shot two Pakistani men in Lahore in February, also highlighted divisions between Washington and Islamabad. But Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, believes the bin Laden operation ""shows that underneath this actually there is a pretty firm relationship."" ""It is highly significant that Pakistan allowed this to happen on their territory so near their capital,"" he added. According to a U.S. official the Pakistan authorities had not been informed ahead of the actual raid. The implications for al Qaeda, bin Laden's terrorist network, are also significant. ""It is unlikely to kill off al Qaeda but it is going to have a huge psychological impact on members of the organization,"" says Robertson. ""It's likely we'll hear members of the organization on the internet saying they don't believe this; al Qaeda members are going to say this is part of western propaganda until they see some evidence."" Peter Bergen met bin Laden in 1997 and believes that al Qaeda will perhaps be irrecoverably damaged by the death of bin Laden. ""There's no one who can replace him. When you join al Qaeda you pledge a personal oath of allegiance (to him),"" he says. American-Yemeni cleric Anwar al Awlaki plays a leadership role for al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, but believes Bergen, ""(he) is not a major hero to the global jihadi movement who fought the Soviets and U.S. for two decades (like bin Laden).""","Death of bin Laden in Pakistan mansion proves he had been 'hiding in plain sight'

"Tokyo (CNN) -- They sleep anywhere they can find open space -- in conference rooms, corridors, even stairwells. They have one blanket, no pillows and a leaded mat intended to keep radiation at bay. They eat only two meals each day -- a carefully rationed breakfast of 30 crackers and vegetable juice and for dinner, a ready-to-eat meal or something out of a can.They clean themselves with wet wipes, since the supply of fresh water is short. These are the grueling living conditions for the workers inside Japan's crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. They've been hailed as heroes risking their lives by braving high levels of radiation as they work to avert a nuclear meltdown. But until now, the outside world has known little about the workers' routine. Tuesday, safety inspector Kazuma Yokota, who spent five days at the plant last week, spoke with CNN about the plight of the 400 workers staying in a building within 1 kilometer (.6 of a mile) of Reactor No. 1. Japanese officials ordered mandatory evacuations for everyone else within 20 (12.4 miles) kilometers of the plant. The workers look tired, Yokota said. They are furiously connecting electrical cables, repairing instrument panels and pumping radioactive water out. They work with the burden of their own personal tragedies always weighing heavily. ""My parents were washed away by the tsunami, and I still don't know where they are,"" one worker wrote in an e-mail that was verified as authentic by a spokesman for the Tokyo Electric Power Co., which runs the Fukushima plant. ""Crying is useless,"" said another e-mail. ""If we're in hell now, all we can do is crawl up towards heaven."" But they are doing it all with the kind of determination required in a task with such high stakes. There's no room for plummeting morale and the workers are not showing any signs of spirits flagging, Yokota said. However upbeat the workers are, there's no denying the conditions are beyond difficult. ""On the ground at the nuclear power plant, the workers are working under very dangerous and very hard conditions, and I feel a great deal of respect for them,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Tuesday. The workers spend three days on site and go off for one. They start their work day at 8 a.m. and go for 12 long hours. Gary Was, a nuclear engineering expert at the University of Michigan, told CNN Tuesday that contaminated seawater brings potential danger ""and they need to take all precautions."" Particulates that land on the skin or are ingested ""can be a constant source of radiation into the future,"" Was said. ""You need to be very careful not to ingest any of that."" Was said officials need to remove and store contaminated water. Last week, three men who were laying electrical cable in the turbine building of the No. 3 reactor stepped in tainted water, exposing themselves to high levels of radiation. Tokyo Electric apologized and said their exposure might have been avoided with better communication. Radiation alarms went off while the three men were working, but they continued with their mission for 40 to 50 minutes after assuming it was a false alarm. They were hospitalized after it was determined they had been exposed to 173 to 181 millisieverts of radiation -- two of them with direct exposure on their skin. They were later released. By comparison, a person in an industrialized country is naturally exposed to 3 millisieverts per year, though Japan's Health Ministry has said that those working directly to avert the nuclear crisis could be exposed to as much as 250 millisieverts before they must leave the site. The incident also prompted further criticism of Tokyo Electric and how well it is safeguarding the workers. Yokota said the power company hoped to improve living conditions for the workers by moving them to another facility. Edano said officials also hope to find replacements in order to relieve the workers at the plant. Until then, they will continue as the faceless heroes in Japan's tragedy, the nation's only hope of thwarting further disaster.","The Fukushima Daiichi workers are sleeping on mats .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that it would work to ban the sale of some mouse and rat poisons in a bid to better protect children and pets. The agency in 2008 gave makers of such poisons until last week to research, develop and register new products that would be safer than those that were then on the market. Many companies complied, but some did not. Among the targets are such popular rodent poisons as D-Con, Victor and Hot Shot, the agency said. ""These changes are essential to reduce the thousands of accidental exposures of children that occur every year from rat and mouse control products and also to protect household pets,"" said Steve Owens, assistant administrator for EPA's office of chemical safety and pollution prevention. ""Today's action will help keep our children and pets safe from these poisons."" The EPA said that as many as 15,000 children under the age of 6 are exposed to rat and mouse poisons each year. Children are especially at risk, the agency said, because poisons are often put on the floor and kids will sometimes put bait pellets in their mouths. The sales ban would cover most loose bait and pellet products, the agency said. The EPA also intends to ban the residential sale of poisons that contain certain compounds -- brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difethialone and difenacoum -- because of their toxicity. Professional pest control and agricultural workers would still be allowed to use them, the agency said.","The agency cites a need to better protect children and pets .

"Washington (CNN) -- John Keith rattles each pill bottle and raps it down on the table, 15 in all. ""That's what they had me on right there, every day,"" the former sailor says of the prescriptions he received from Veterans Affairs doctors. Keith, who lives in California, says his case is an example of how government doctors over-prescribe for active-duty and retired military, with often disastrous results. On the other side of the country, the Ohio family of Chris Bachus, a decorated Marine who died in his sleep from an accidental drug overdose, also says military doctors are writing too many prescriptions. ""How could a team of doctors, allegedly working together, prescribe all those things together?"" Jerry Bachus asks of the doctors who treated his brother with dozens of separate medications. And the military itself is struggling with demands of its personnel returning from multiple warzone deployments and seeking treatment for a variety of injuries and mental issues. Navy veteran Keith blames multiple tours in the Persian Gulf, on board the USS Kitty Hawk, for a variety of ailments including post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. But he blames government doctors for loading him up on pills. ""After I was taking the 10 pills and it wasn't working, I went back to the VA, and they prescribed me five more pills on top of everything else,"" Keith said. Then came blackouts, and once he tossed furniture out of a friend's apartment. ""I'd thrown it off the balcony, and I had no recollection whatsoever,"" Keith explained. ""I called a VA doctor and told her what happened. She said, 'Oh, it's too strong. Just cut the pills in half and take half.' I did that, and the next thing I know, I was being arrested by the Dallas police,"" Keith said. In Ohio, Bachus' brother questions why the successful Marine gunnery sergeant had his own oversupply of legally prescribed medicines when he died. ""They were all legitimately prescribed drugs from physicians who had sat right in front of him and evaluated his condition, and whatever he had an issue of, they would either increase the dosage or the potency of the individual pill,"" Jerry Bachus said at his home outside Columbus. He shows off the Iraqi battle flag that Chris brought back from one of Saddam Hussein's palaces after he fought his way through Baghdad. He thumbs through photos, including one of the two brothers visiting Washington. And he tells about how his brother was usually the happiest guy around. ""He laughed and smiled a lot. He had a great time. He lived life to its fullest. He lived life the way people wished they did,"" Bachus says. But after multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan and 17 years in the Corps, Chris was just a shadow. ""He was passive. He was ghostly,"" Jerry Bachus said, describing how he failed to convince his brother that he wasn't really fit to serve. But Bachus shipped out again to Iraq in 2007, coming back early with stress complaints and suspicions of a traumatic brain injury from a roadside bomb. The cover letter on the official military autopsy for Chris Bachus strongly recommends that family members not read it alone, but with a family friend or minister. It spells out the 27 prescriptions found near the body in March 2008, at Camp Geiger in North Carolina. The death was ruled accidental, blamed on ""multi-drug toxicity."" The list of 27 prescription bottles found at the scene of death takes up most of a page of the autopsy, from topiramate to oxycodone to lorazepam. Jerry Bachus admits that the military faces enormous demands, countless requests to ease both the physical and mental pain. ""You're gonna give me whatever I need to make me feel better, and you're gonna make me go away ... because there's 1,000 people standing in line behind me that just came off the bus with me,"" he said. The armed services have recognized the problem as a reflection of what also is playing out in civilian life as well. ""I think in some cases yes, certainly, I think there is over-reliance,"" said Brig. Gen. Richard Thomas, the Army's assistant surgeon general. ""But I think ... it reflects how we are in society; we do have a tendency to rely on prescription meds."" Thomas says the Army has implemented rules to limit the number of people who can prescribe medications for an individual patient, as well as new scrutiny of cases in which multiple prescriptions have been written. New prescriptions may carry a time limit, with no refills without a new examination. ""We have some new policies that are out to address poly-pharmacy, multiple medications, to make sure we are prescribing these things in a safe and responsible manner to protect the patient,"" Thomas said. ""Ultimately, because we don't want to leave the responsibility for figuring it out in the hands of the patient."" And the military is exploring new treatments, without drugs. ""Whether it be acupuncture or biofeedback or yoga therapy, there is a host of other things we can provide to patients to take care of them right, other than narcotics,"" Thomas said. ""Narcotics may still have a role, but it doesn't have as big a role, and there are alternatives, and that's the key."" Meanwhile, Jerry Bachus keeps asking why doctors, commanders and even fellow Marines didn't raise the alarm. ""Just to say we gave this trooper a bag of pills, that doesn't wash,"" he said. ""It just isn't good enough. It just isn't good enough."" CNN Pentagon Correspondent Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","One Navy veteran says he took 15 medications a day .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho's remarkable nine-year unbeaten home league record came to an end on Saturday as Real Madrid suffered a shock 1-0 defeat by Sporting Gijon which allowed Barcelona to take an eight-point lead in Spain's La Liga. The Portuguese coach had not lost a home match since February 2002, a 150-match streak taking in his trophy-laden stints with Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and now Real. His injury-hit team took to the field without top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, in-form striker Karim Benzema, defender Marcelo and suspended key midfielder Xabi Alonso, though Argentina forward Gonzalo Higuain made a welcome return as a second-half substitute after back surgery. Former Real star Ronaldo was honored at the Santiago Bernabeu before the match to farewell the club's fans following the Brazil legend's recent retirement, but Gijon -- placed a lowly 15th before kickoff -- ruined their hopes of an anticipated routine victory. Those expectations rose when Ricardo Carvalho had the ball in the net in the fourth minute, but the veteran Portugal defender was ruled to be offside. Miguel de las Cuevas, formerly at Real's local rivals Atletico, scored the only goal with a low shot that went in off the post in the 78th minute as Los Merengues were left to rue a series of missed chances. Mourinho must now decide whether to bring back Ronaldo for Tuesday's Champions League quarterfinal first leg at home to English club Tottenham, with Real's hopes of a domestic crown all-but over with eight rounds to play after a similarly-depleted Barcelona side scraped a 1-0 win over Villarreal in Saturday's late match. ""We will have chances to win against Tottenham Hotspur if we play a solid game and don't have problems in attack. It wouldn't be dramatic to draw against them at home,"" Mourinho told Real's website. ""Luck plays a role in this game and our opponent had all of it tonight. Our only problem was the absence of creative players. Xabi Alonso will play on Tuesday and he's the only one who can change our style a little. ""We can earn a different result on Tuesday with the same players. Cristiano Ronaldo will play if he and his coach decide to take a risk. The decision of risking it belongs only to him and to me. I may risk it."" Barcelona started the match at Villarreal with top scorer Lionel Messi on the bench after missing Argentina's midweek friendly due to an injury worry, while captain Carles Puyol, key midfielder Xavi, winger Pedro were ruled out along with veteran French defender Eric Abidal. Stand-in skipper Victor Valdes kept his side in the match with some important first-half saves, but the match turned when coach Pep Guardiola brought on Messi for midfielder Seydou Keita seven minutes after the interval. The winning goal came, however, from an unlikely source in the 67th minute as central defender Gerard Pique showed good skills to chest down Sergio Busquets' header from Dani Alves' corner and volley into the net despite suspicions of handball. Valdes came to Barca's rescue with five minutes to play as he did well to block a goalbound shot from midfielder Santi Cazorla. Barca will return to the Nou Camp on Wednesday for the Champions League quarterfinal tie at home to top Ukraine side Shakhtar Donetsk. Villarreal lost third place after Valencia won 4-2 at Getafe earlier in the day, bouncing back from two successive defeats as Roberto Soldado scored all four goals against his former club. The Madrid side led after 12 minutes through Manu del Moral, but Soldado leveled a minute after the break from Juan Mata's pass. The striker made it 2-1 on 64 from a Jonas assist and clinched his hat-trick soon after, while Mata was again his provider in the 77th minute. Adrian Sardinero scored a late consolation for Getafe, who have slumped to 14th place -- five points above the relegation zone -- after winning just once in 14 games.","Barcelona's lead grows to eight points after Real Madrid's defeat by Sporting Gijon .

"(CNN) -- Sean Kingston is walking around Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital eight days after he was brought there in critical condition following a personal-watercraft crash, the publicist for Epic Records said Monday. Kingston, 21, has been upgraded to serious condition, publicist Joe Carozza said. ""Sean is breathing on his own and walked for the first time this morning,"" Carozza said. Two sources close to the hip-hop artist told CNN last week that doctors expected Kingston to need about six weeks to recover. He suffered a broken jaw, a fractured wrist and water in his lungs, according to the sources, who both asked not to be identified since they were not authorized to speak to the media. Cassandra Sanchez, 23, was riding on the Sea Doo personal watercraft with Kingston when it crashed into a Miami bridge on May 29, according to an accident report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Sanchez was also injured and hospitalized. Kingston had bought the Sea Doo just days before, as he was moving into a new house in Miami, one of the sources said. His life vest apparently fell off during the crash, causing him to sink below the water, according to witnesses. ""They were calling us over, telling us, 'He's drowning, he's drowning,' "" said Carmen Rivera, who was boating nearby with her husband, Jonathan Rivera, and friend Jimmy Vega. The three rescuers were interviewed by CNN affiliate WSVN-TV. ""We jumped in the water to help him keep his head above water,"" Vega said. ""I pushed him up, and he was vomiting what seemed like water, and then there was some blood coming out,"" Jonathan Rivera said. The Miami-born artist changed his name from Kisean Anderson to Kingston to reflect his Jamaican heritage. He shot to fame in 2007 when his debut song ""Beautiful Girls"" became a No. 1 hit in the United States.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The number of suicides in Japan hit a two-year high in the month of May, according to data released Wednesday by the nation's authorities. For the first time in two years, the monthly suicide number topped 3,000 in the month of May, the National Police Agency said. The report says suicides in Japan totaled 3,281 in May 2011, up nearly 20% from the same month last year. The spike reverses a steady decline in the number of suicides since the end of last year, when the government launched a national public awareness campaign. Japan was struck by a devastating earthquake and tsunami on March 11, and continues to grapple with a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. National suicide figures increased the two months following the disaster, the figures show. The most populous region of Tokyo saw the highest number of suicides in May at 325, the agency said. In the area hit hardest by the nuclear crisis, Fukushima saw 19 more suicides in May 2011 compared with May last year, with a total of 68. The tsunami-devastated prefecture of Miyagi showed no change in its suicide numbers and Iwate prefecture saw a decline of three. Northern Japan, which was devastated by the tsunami, had the highest rate of suicide in the country in 2010, according to the police agency. Iwate prefecture in 2010 had the second-highest suicide rate. Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures last year had a higher suicide rate than Tokyo. Japan's suicide rate remains one of the highest among developed nations, according to the World Health Organization.","Monthly suicide number tops 3,000 for the first time in two years .

"(CNN) -- Sepp Blatter has told CNN that his main aim in his fourth and final term as FIFA president is to restore the battered credibility of world football's governing body. The 75-year-old was re-elected unopposed as head of the organization on June 1 after the only other candidate, Asian Federation chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, pulled out of the race before being provisionally suspended by FIFA over bribery allegations. The vote drew widespread criticism as Blatter received 186 votes from football's 208 member associations, with critics saying it should not have gone ahead until the investigation into Hammam and FIFA vice-president Jack Warner -- who was also subject to suspension -- had been completed. ""I have said 'zero tolerance' is one thing, but I have also said the social and cultural implementation of football is important -- but now it's to rebuild the image of FIFA, that's number one, and I have already started,"" Blatter told CNN in his first sit-down interview since the election. Never mind Saint Sepp, the system is to blame . ""We are now somewhere where football needs a little bit more credibility because we came building up football, bringing so much money in to this game. ""Automatically a lot of devils came in to the game and now we are in a situation where we have to go forward and we have to cut all these allegations, criticism, whatever. We can't do it in one day, but we will do it."" Blatter -- who described his election win as ""the title without glory"" and called the ruling body ""my FIFA"" -- ruled out blanket life bans for any FIFA member found guilty of corruption. ""It's not a killing instinct that we have to kill people! Zero tolerance means that if you commit something outside the play of field, you will have a punishment,"" the Swiss administrator said. ""But it can be a yellow card, it can be a red card, it can be a suspension for two games, three games ... lifetime."" Maradona attacks 'corrupt' FIFA chiefs . Despite recent turmoil and opposition to Blatter in the race for the presidency, the Swiss insisted that both Hammam and Warner were longtime friends who remain on good terms. ""We are friends, but friends going together when it is in the interest of some of the people. For me, going together with people it's only for the interest of FIFA because I have represented FIFA for 36 years -- it's my FIFA,"" Blatter said. Warner has since backed down, for legal reasons, on threats to release ""a football tsunami"" by making public his email correspondence with Blatter. ""This is a question of character. If you have a problem inside your family you are not going to disclose if there is anything to be disclosed to the public,"" Blatter said. ""But I don't know what he means by the tsunami! It's easy to say, it's like allegations made by (England's former 2018 bid leader) Lord Triesman -- these are allegations and there is no evidence, so if somebody says it's a tsunami, you know there are also very little tsunamis."" Blatter commits to 'change' after winning FIFA's presidential vote . Blatter said he would not open an investigation into the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar -- Hammam's native country, which has been accused of bribing delegates ahead of last December's controversial vote -- unless his proposed new ""solutions committee"" or FIFA's existing ethics panel recommended such a probe. FIFA's own secretary general Jerome Valcke wrote an email suggesting that Qatar's financial clout had been behind its success. ""Let me work now on this new approach of the ethics committee, let me work with this committee of solutions. And if this committee of solutions or the ethics committee have the impression that they should do something then let them take the decisions,"" Blatter said. Blatter has vowed to bring in a panel of experts to form the solutions committee and help address FIFA's problems, including 88-year-old former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff, 64, and 70-year-old opera great Placido Domingo. ""These gentlemen are more or less advisers. They are not the experts but advisers, and what they should be also is the kind of council of wisdom -- which my Executive Committee would not like because they think they are the council of wisdom,"" Blatter said. ""Placido Domingo will be part -- he is happy, he is proud that he is part -- as Kissinger also! People say he (Kissinger) is an old man, but he is a wise man."" The solutions committee will be chaired by a FIFA official, with Blatter dismissing suggestions that it should be an entirely independent body. ""The football family has asked me to solve the solution inside FIFA and not outside FIFA,"" he said. ""And if we have to go and open our borders and say everyone can come in ... we are a very organized institution with 208 associations, six continents. I've put already zero tolerance in the agenda!""","Sepp Blatter admits that FIFA's reputation has been tainted by recent scandals .

"(CNN) -- Will you marry me? That question carries an extreme amount of significance for those who are popping the question and for those who must answer. While weddings have long been planned to a T and photographed and videotaped, marriage proposals are rapidly becoming public events with some videotaped for the enjoyment of family, friends and millions of strangers. Posted on sites such as YouTube and Vimeo, the videotaped proposals can go viral overnight with millions of viewers. That's what happened to one video of an elaborately orchestrated proposal in a movie theater. ""We had no idea it'd be such a viral success, but there were particular elements that made it so successful,"" says Michael Escobar, the videographer who recorded both Matt asking his fiancee's father for her hand and Matt's epic route to get to the theater where Ginny was with her brother. Famously dubbed the movie trailer proposal for Matt and Ginny, Escobar's production got more than 10 million views in less than two weeks. What is it about proposal videos that draw so many viewers from around the world? ""These videos reflect our need to 'connect' with one another,"" says Steven Sherwood, a sociology professor at Los Angeles Valley College. ""They are therefore just the most contemporary version of the smoke signal of communicating what's important to us. Escobar says proposal videos ""give hope for a lot of people,"" and that ""when you see something genuine and heartwarming you gravitate towards it."" For Christina Nelson, 42, a Kenyan immigrant who's been married for six years, the emotional aspect of these videos are what touch her. ""I know what they're feeling and wow. I just love how they feel,"" Nelson says, adding that her girlfriends often pass links to such videos along to her. Nelson explains, ""Women are emotional beings -- so are men -- but we have another degree of emotion and we love the fact that it's being exposed."" It's the same factor that made songs by Elvis, and now Justin Bieber, wildly popular in today's culture: women who want to be warmed by romance -- theirs or someone else's. Ashli Reese, a young bachelorette living in Atlanta, sums up her reaction to watching proposal videos: ""I want that one day. I want that to be me. I want to feel the way they feel."" For men, these public emotional displays online can elicit a different reaction. ""I'll watch for the entertainment,"" says 24-year-old Tracy McClades. And even though he says he hasn't found ""the one"" yet, he admits he can ""get ideas from them"" and be prepared when he is ready to propose to his future wife. Atlanta resident George Nelson proposed six years ago in the middle of a busy restaurant while his friends documented the moment. He offers another reason why people videos of these used-to-be private moments. ""When there's a new trend, we want to be a part of the trend -- both male and female,"" says Nelson. John Schlueter, who proposed last year while running with the Olympic Torch, says public proposals and videos represent ""competition for men,"" while being, ""heartwarming for women."" Although he didn't have a video made of his proposal, he and his wife are reminded of their emotional moment every time they see the Olympic torch that he carried during the proposal hanging in the middle of their living room. Escobar doesn't see the proposal competition as a bad thing. ""If it does have people step up their game, if it sparks a person to go the extra mile for the person they love, that's a good thing.""

"(CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela is ""resting at his home"" in Qunu, Eastern Cape, South Africa announced Monday, amid concerns that his health is in decline. Mandela, 92, ""is now well enough to travel,"" President Jacob Zuma said in a statement. The anti-apartheid icon was not well enough to vote at a polling station in a local election in Johannesburg earlier this month and cast his ballot from home. The Nobel Laureate no longer makes public appearances and has not been seen in public since the final of the FIFA World Cup in Johannesburg on July 11. Earlier this year, concerns over Mandela's health flared after he was rushed from Cape Town and admitted to a Johannesburg hospital with pnemonia. Since the health scare, neither the South African government, the Mandela family or the Mandela Foundation has released specific information on his health, saying it is a private matter. The government reiterated the message on Monday, thanking ""the public and the media for granting him privacy in the last three months, and we urge them to continue to do so."" Mandela spent 27 years in prison under the white-dominated South African apartheid regime, finally walking free from Robben Island in 1990. He and South Africa's then-President F.

"(CNN) -- The artist known as the Picasso if India, Maqbool Fida Husain, died Thursday in a London hospital on Thursday. He was 95. The celebrated but controversial artist is credited with introducing the avant garde movement to India and for influencing a whole generation of artists. It's a huge shock to the nation, he has left a huge void in the world of Indian art,"" said gallery owner Arun Vadhera, who described Husain as a close friend. Vadhera was with the a artist at the Royal Brompton hospital, where Husain died of cardiac arrest. He had been admitted to the hospital after he had trouble breathing from fluid in his lungs, Vadhera said. ""But he was chatting away,"" Vadhera said. A self-taught artist, Husain was part of the Progressive Artists' Group in the 1940s. His Indian folklore-inspired paintings sold for millions of dollars, making Husain one of India's highest paid artists. ""Husain is the father of Indian modern art. Indian art would not have become so successful had it not been for him, and today the roof of Indian art has been removed,"" Vadhera said. But Husain's work was controversial. He received death threats from Hindu fundamentalists who were offended by the artist's depictions of Hindu goddesses in the nude and a painting of a nude woman in the shape of the map of India. His work was condemned and his exhibitions vandalized. Husain left India had been living in self-imposed exile in Dubai since 2005. He was offered citizenship by the government of Qatar, which he accepted in 2010. ""I hope at least now the Indian government will give him the honor and respect that is long long due"" art critic S.

"(CNN) -- On April 9, 2010, the sun-powered Solar Impulse HB-SIA aircraft took off from a runway in Paverne, Switzerland, on its maiden flight. Over the next 87 minutes it climbed to 1,200 meters, and undertook a series of tests and maneuvers to assess its reliability and performance, before returning test pilot Markus Scherdel safely to earth. But does this remarkable new aircraft really represent the future of clean, green aviation? The team behind the flight aim to build a solar-powered plane capable of flying at night on stored energy that can circumnavigate the globe. To find out more, CNN.com spoke to Solar Impulse Chairman and initiator, Bertrand Piccard. CNN: How did you feel after the first test flight? Piccard: The whole flight was an extremely intense moment, specifically the take-off. And when the plane touched the ground I felt an amazing sense of relief. We had the confirmation that the team who worked on this solar airplane for the last 7 years did an astounding job. This prototype is an amazingly complicated piece of engineering, with the wingspan of a jumbo jet, the weight of a car and the average power of a small motorcycle. CNN: How successful was it? Piccard: The first indications from the engineers are that everything went perfectly well -- the climb performances were even higher than expected! What is the next stage? The objective of this first prototype is to demonstrate by this summer, the feasibility of a night flight propelled only by solar energy. Before that, we'll do several additional test flights, each lasting a bit longer, until we complete the first complete day-night-day flight cycle. Then with the experience of this first aircraft we will start the design of a second airplane whose objectives will be to cross the Atlantic and then by 2013, to fly around the world in five legs, each lasting five days. CNN: What is your ultimate vision for the project? Piccard:  With Solar Impulse we want to demonstrate what can be achieved today with renewable energy and technologies that allow energy savings. If an aircraft is able to fly day and night without fuel, propelled only by solar energy, no one will be allowed to claim anymore that it is impossible to use the same technologies for motor vehicles, heating and cooling systems or computers, etc. This project voices our conviction that a pioneering spirit with political vision can together change society and reduce society's dependence on fossil energies. CNN: Do you see it having commercial applications? If so, what and when might we see them in use? Piccard: We could see our technologies used for high altitude remote-controlled solar-powered telecommunication platforms. But for airliners, remember when Lindbergh made his Atlantic flight in 1927; he was alone in an airplane whose payload was used for gasoline and nobody could imagine that hundreds of passengers would cross the ocean a few years later. Today, Solar Impulse holds one pilot and 400kgs of batteries. CNN: What will happen in the future? Piccard: I don't know, but aviation will have to evolve to meet the challenges of environment and increasing fuel prices. CNN: How will solar-powered planes fly at night or in very bad weather? Piccard: The 200 square meters of solar cells on the wing of the aircraft will allow the propellers to run during the day and reach an altitude of 27,000 feet. At the same time, the excess of energy will charge the 400 kg of batteries. At sunset, the airplane will slowly glide down to 10 000 ft and the energy stored in the batteries during the day, will be released to allow the aircraft to fly during the night. The batteries have to carry the airplane until the next sunrise! Of course we need sun light during the day, and we have to avoid flying in bad weather, particularly because our gigantic wingspan and very light wing loading don't accept big turbulences. CNN: How have big aerospace corporations responded to your project? Piccard: The first one who immediately believed in my vision was Paul MaCready from Aero Environment. Then the support came from the EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), Dassault Aviation, Solvay and Altran Technologies to launch the project. The feasibility study lead by André Borschberg illustrated that it would be extremely difficult, albeit feasible. The aircraft would need a gigantic wingspan and have to be exceptionally light. For the construction, we went to aircraft manufacturers with our requirements and they said it was impossible: hence we approached a boat manufacturer -- and as he didn't know it was impossible, he helped us. We had to assemble our own team and during 7 years we went through calculations, simulations, projections, design, construction and thousand of tests. Of course, the journey until the around the world tour is still long and filled with many challenges. However, today we have accomplished a successful maiden flight with the first prototype. CNN: The global aerospace industry is obviously vast and has much entrenched knowledge and technology; do you think corporations will be open-minded and open to change? Piccard: Undoubtedly, they will have to! The price of fuel will progressively become unaffordable: it's just a question of time. The industries will have to reduce their consumption by using energy savings technologies and switch to renewables. There are corporations that understood this and already now invest in clean tech. Those who don't will go bankrupt, because they will have missed out on this new trend! The question is, ""On which side do you want to be?""","Maiden flight of Solar Impulse plane is first step towards solar night flying .

"Havana (CNN) -- Cuba denied on Monday that the recent death of a dissident was caused by a police beating and accused ""counterrevolutionaries"" and the foreign media of ""fabricating lies."" Juan Wilfredo Soto died in a hospital on Sunday in the central city of Santa Clara. He had been detained by police three days earlier. Fellow dissidents accused police of beating him and causing his death. The Arnaldo Milian Hospital said he had died of pancreatitis. The state-run, Spanish-language website www.cubadebate.cu repeated those claims in an article posted on Monday night titled ""A press release from the Cuban government: Cuba denies the campaign about the death of Juan Wilfredo Soto Garcia."" According to the article, Soto died a ""natural death"" brought on by an ""acute pancreatitis."" ""There were no internal or external signs of violence,"" the article said. According to Lizet Zamora, an anti-government activist also from Santa Clara, the police are to blame. ""We know his death was caused by the police beating,"" she told CNN by telephone. Zamora attended Soto's funeral. According to Zamora and other dissidents, Soto was detained by police on Thursday and was beaten in public view in a park when he tried to resist arrest. She said she saw a cell phone recording of the beating. The state-run website confirmed that Soto had been detained, but said he was released ""three hours later without any incident whatsoever."" Soto was not well-known outside of Santa Clara, but according to Zamora, he was active within the dissident community there. His funeral was held on Sunday. The article accused the foreign media, ""fundamentally from Europe and the United States,"" of amplifying lies told by dissidents. ""External and internal enemies try to distort the Cuban reality and undermine the international prestige of the Revolution and its moral strength,"" the article concluded.","Juan Wilfredo Soto died in a hospital on Sunday in central Cuban city of Santa Clara .

"(CNN) -- Suspected Maoist insurgents killed nine policemen during an ambush in eastern India, authorities said Tuesday. A 10th officer is missing. The attack took place Monday in a remote area of Gariaband in Chhattisgarh state when the officers were on their way to search a house as part of anti-Maoist operation, said state police spokesman Rajesh Mishra. Their truck broke down, and they were attacked as they were waiting for a second vehicle to arrive, he said. About 10 days ago, seven officers were killed when they were ambushed as they were returning from routine patrol, Mishra said. ""It's a war-like situation here,"" he said. The Maoist movement is considered by the government as India's greatest internal security threat. The Maoist guerrillas are called Naxalites after Naxalbari, a village in neighboring West Bengal state where they originated in the late 1960s. Officials say the Naxals aim to seize political power through what they call a protracted people's war. For their part, the insurgents have claimed since the 1960s to be fighting for the dispossessed. Over the years, they targeted Indian security forces in several impoverished eastern Indian states that have become known as the ""Red Corridor.""

"(CNN) -- Every day, thousands of children are living and working on the streets of Vietnam's cities. Michael Brosowski is trying to give many of them a chance at a brighter future. Through Brosowski's Blue Dragon Children's Foundation, more than 350 Vietnamese children have been given safe shelter and enrolled in school. The organization has a network of programs in cities throughout Vietnam, and it recently broadened its efforts to combat child trafficking. So far, it has rescued more than 100 trafficked children. Brosowski recently spoke with CNN about the struggles facing Vietnam's street children. CNN: Who are Vietnam's street kids? Michael Brosowski: When we were starting out back in 2002, the kids were pretty much all boys coming from rural areas. And they were coming to make a little bit of money to supplement the family income. Mom and dad can hardly afford money to send the rest of the kids to school, can't afford to get enough food on the table, so they think, well, you might as well go to Hanoi and work. These days, we're mostly coming across runaway children, and it's where kids are having some kind of family problem. Poverty is usually part of the problem, but it's not the only problem. Very often, there might be alcoholism, sometimes drug use. It might be that one of the parents has died and the remaining parent has remarried and then that new husband and wife couple don't want the kids from the previous marriage. So kids are ending up now on the streets of Hanoi more because they feel unwanted at home rather than coming here to earn money to support the family. CNN: What dangers do the kids face on the streets in Vietnam? Brosowski: The dangers now are much greater, and there are more of them than when we started out. There's a lot more gang activity on the streets and a lot more cases of trafficking. One reason that street kids here in Vietnam are mostly boys is that the families have this view that the girls should be somewhere safe and secure, but the boys are fine (and) they can wander around at will. In reality, they're not fine. In reality, the boys are facing gangs, they're facing arrest. And the longer they're out on the street, the worse habits they learn. There are gangs selling heroin, and heroin here is very cheap, widely accessible and a lot of people's job is to get young people hooked on it so that then they've got to start buying it. Meanwhile, the girls ... they're going to end up in positions that can very often be exploitative or abusive. So we've also got to think about how to protect the girls. Watch Brosowski meet a girl who was almost trafficked . CNN: What are some of the challenges you and your group encounter when working with street kids? Brosowski: As satisfying as (this work) is, it's not easy. One of the things I always tell my staff is, ""It's never the end of the story."" Today, there might be a kid who is getting in trouble, has broken the law, he's had a fight in our center, he's told the staff to get lost. Tomorrow, that same kid might really start to make a change in their life. But equally there can be a kid doing really well today -- doing his best at school, behaving well. And tomorrow he might be out there stealing with a gang. So our work is never finished, in a sense. There's always something more that could happen, and I think that's the biggest frustration for us. Sometimes there are kids we've worked with for a year who've then come back at night, broken in and robbed us. That's what hurts us all the most, because we take that personally. We put so much of ourselves into the kids. But we've had kids do that and then come back to us later really sorry. And they've actually come back to make amends. And that's more powerful still to have someone who's been with us and then gone astray and then come back, because I think that shows the power of our work.

"(CNN) -- It was just before Christmas when Michel Martelly mulled over events in his troubled land and concluded that everything had been done to ensure loss for him at the polls. An election rife with fraud had ousted him from the race. Martelly's dreams of leading Haiti were all but dead. But four months of recounts and reviews and then a runoff changed everything, and the unexpected candidate is poised now to move into the presidential office. Unexpected because Martelly has never been a politician. He's better known as ""Sweet Mickey,"" a popular kompa singer who enthralled his fans with bad-boy antics on stage. He cursed and swayed with a bottle of Barbancourt rum in his hands and on occasion, mooned his audience. It's an image that Martelly said he cultivated solely for the stage. Still, it led many to question whether he was fit to run a nation, especially one as beleaguered as Haiti. Already the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti is reeling from devastation caused by last year's massive earthquake followed by a cholera epidemic later in the year. A perceived lack of progress prompted Haitians to vote against Jude Celestin, the government-backed candidate. Martelly, they said, was a fresh face in politics, untainted by the corruption that has marred many a presidency in Haiti. ""To Haitians, particularly the legions of young and jobless, Martelly is an outsider who can bring change to Haiti,"" longtime Haiti observer Jocelyn McCalla said on Twitter. Martelly's victory falls in line with the signal the Haitian people have been sending for a while, said Garry Pierre-Pierre, editor and publisher of the New York-based newspaper The Haitian Times. ""They don't want the establishment. They don't want the status quo,"" he said. On the streets of Port-au-Prince, thousands turned out to chant one of his most popular nicknames: ""Tet Kale,"" which means bald head in Creole. Haitians, especially the youth, were starving for a fresh face. And they got it Monday when the election council announced preliminary results. Martelly won by a landslide with 67.6% of the vote, soundly defeating his challenger, former first lady Mirlande Manigat, who received 31.5%. Pierre-Pierre called Martelly's campaign impressive. He came out of nowhere and stunned established politicians with his strong showing in November. ""This was a man who could move millions with a microphone,"" Pierre-Pierre said. But at first, the election council said Martelly had placed third, behind Manigat and Celestin, meaning he was not eligible for a runoff. His supporters took to the streets, angry at what they said was a rigged election. Then came a review of the vote, monitored by the Organization of American States. The review resulted in Celestin's removal from the ballot and placed Martelly in the runoff. It was exactly what the candidate had hoped for back in December when he laid out for CNN his plan to lift Haiti out of its misery. Martelly appeared in jeans and a button-down shirt at his plush home in Peguyville, a suburb of Port-au-Prince up in the hills. A silver arm cuff hugged his right wrist and he sipped hard on his favorite ice-cream soda. He sat at a table surrounded by a piano and eight wall-mounted speakers. It was not hard to tell this was a party house. Haiti, he said then, was on the brink of revolution. ""This is a very dangerous corner in Haiti's history,"" he said. ""But it's a revolution that can be done peacefully through the election."" Under the father-and-son Duvalier dictatorship, Haitians lacked freedom, but the people had clean roads, electricity, jobs, security, Martelly said. When democracy came overnight to this Caribbean nation, people didn't know how to handle it. Martelly spoke of 24 years of troubled times, of a poor country that, he said, hurtled backward into even more poverty. ""We are ruled by corruption,"" he said. ""The people have no confidence in their government."" The lack of confidence was further eroded by a presidential election in disarray. ""You know how (U.S. President Barack) Obama said it's not about the man, but it's about the plan?"" he said. ""Here it's more about the man than about the plan."" Haiti will go nowhere, he said, unless the people have a president they can trust, a president who is honest. He was that man, he insisted. He said his background in music as well as social work -- he founded an aid agency that helps the poor -- gave him 22 years on the ground. The people know him, he said. He was their light at the end of the tunnel. But the man also had plans. He said, for instance, that the $12 billion that was pledged by the international community for earthquake assistance should come in the form of infrastructure, not money, because Haitians don't know how to manage money. ""People are fed up here,"" he said. ""They have no food, no education, no health care. What kind of place is it when a young girl will sell her body to buy a phone card?"" Martelly exuded confidence that he could bring change to Haiti. But not everyone is so sure. ""He's stepping into not only a complicated moment in Haitian history but he is also stepping into the wasp's nest of Haitian politics,"" said Amy Wilentz, author of ""The Rainy Season: Haiti Then and Now."" Wilentz said Martelly is a big unknown -- a pro for voters perhaps but a con for those trying to measure up the next few years of Haitian history. ""I don't see any reason to believe or not to believe he will be good at it,"" Wilentz said. ""I think Haiti needs a fresh start. It needs to step out of the muck."" Maybe, she said, Martelly is the man to do just that. Pierre-Pierre compared Martelly's win to another victory more than two decades ago that catapulted a Catholic priest into the presidency. Jean-Bertrand Aristide was popular in his own right as a man of the church but he also rose to power because he was not from the establishment. ""Martelly spoke in a way Aristide spoke to the people,"" Pierre-Pierre said. ""He spoke to them, not at them."" But look what happened to Aristide, Pierre-Pierre said, referring to the fall of Haiti's first democratically elected president, who coincidentally returned from exile just days before last month's election. Pierre-Pierre drew another comparison as well. Like Aristide, Martelly has no experience in politics. ""He is a musician and a good one at that,"" he said. That makes Pierre-Pierre a fan of Sweet Mickey but not necessarily a supporter of Martelly's. Ultimately, Pierre-Pierre said, what does an entertainer know about Haiti's role in the world. Some Haiti observers went further than that. Irwin Stotzky, a University of Miami lawyer who has studied human rights in Haiti, said Martelly hardly had the credentials to run the country and did not see much hope for the immediate future. He said his majority vote was skewed because Aristide's party, Fanmi Lavalas, was barred from participation. ""It's sort of a bad joke,"" Stotzky said. But criticism doesn't deter Martelly. When asked in December whether a man who made a name dancing and singing had the mettle for his nation's top job, he smiled. ""Well,"" he said. ""Look at what the politicians have done.""","Michel Martelly's popularity escalated him to a political victory .

"Singapore (CNN) -- A Singapore court on Friday rejected an appeal by a British author against a conviction for contempt of court over a book that criticized the  justice system. Author Alan Shadrake was put on trial by the government of Singapore for his book on the death penalty in Singapore. Police arrested him in July, a day after he released his book ""Once A Jolly Hangman"" in Singapore. Statements in his book criticized Singapore's judicial system, leading to the contempt of court charge, according to the attorney general. His book asserts that Singapore's death penalty is applied unfairly to the poor and spares those with money and political connections. Singapore's court of appeal concluded that the book contained statements that undermined the integrity of the judicial system. Those statements ""scandalize the core of the mission and function of the judiciary.  More than that their cumulative effect reveals a marshaling of a series of fabrications, distortions and false imputations in relation to the Courts of Singapore,"" the appeals judge said in a ruling. Shadrake was sentenced to six weeks in jail and a S$ 20,000 fine (U.S. $16,000), a penalty his lawyer calls the ""harshest ever received in a contempt of court case"" in Singapore. The author had not expected his appeal to be successful, said his attorney M. Ravi, a well-known Singaporean human rights lawyer. ""He will continue to fight against the injustices in the way the death penalty is administered in Singapore,""       Ravi said. ""I'm disappointed with the judgement because ... Singaporeans should be allowed to judge the book themselves and not be told how to look at the book. Ravi said Singapore should have looked at allegations in the book as an opportunity for reform.","Author Alan Shadrake writes a book criticizing the  justice system in Singapore .

"(CNN) -- Bubba Watson held his nerve to secure a third win on the PGA Tour Sunday after the 32-year-old beat Webb Simpson in a playoff to clinch the Zurich Classic in New Orleans. The left-hander and fellow American Simpson both finished on 15-under par after final rounds of 69 and a second additional hole was needed to separate the pair. A fine approach shot out of a fairway bunker enabled Watson, who turned professional in 2003, to find the cup with two putts and claim victory. The U.S. duo finished two shots clear of compatriots Jason Dufner and Tommy Gainey and South Korea's K.J. Choi, who all ended the tournament on 13-under. Watson, who had won earlier this year at the Farmers Insurance tournament at Torrey Pines, slipped three-strokes behind Simpson, 25, with only eight holes remaining of regulation play. ""This week, I won [by] not getting down on bad shots, just staying focused on what I'm supposed to be doing,"" Watson told the PGA Tour's official web site. Simpson was hit with a crucial one-stroke penalty on the 15th hole when he was penalized after his ball moved on the green while he was contemplating his next shot. ""I better limit my comments on that rule, because I think it's such a bad rule,"" said Simpson. ""When the wind or other natural things affect the golf ball, the player shouldn't be penalized. ... It was just unfortunate, but Bubba deserves a win, and I'm pretty happy for him."" Watson sympathized with his opponent and acknowledged the punishment handed out to Simpson played a part in his victory. ""If I didn't win, he would have been a nice guy to have win. We went to a playoff, so obviously one shot is the difference. ... It's a sad way to win, but I won."" Australia's Matt Jones finished tied with American George McNeill on 12-under in sixth, with five players, including world number three Luke Donald, finishing one shot further back.","American Bubba Watson wins the Zurich Classic in New Orleans .

"(CNN)  -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has sent letters of invite to both the Pakistani president and prime minister for them to attend the semifinal of the Cricket World Cup between the two nations next week. The match between the two Asian rivals -- two of most passionately supported cricket nations in the world -- takes place in Mohali, India on March 30, and will provide the biggest clash of the 2011 event. And, with tensions between the nations having been high in recent years, Prime Minister Singh has taken the opportunity to prove India and Pakistan can show unity on what is likely to be a passionate and dramatic occasion. Wajid Shamshul Hasan, Pakistan's High Commissioner to London, confirmed the invitations to CNN, although he could not confirm whether prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani or president Asif Ali Zardari would be able to take up the Indian offer. Hasan told CNN: ""We consider it to be a step forward and a confidence building measure. Cricket is a religion in India and Pakistan, so there will be a lot of rising passion. ""Both nations love good cricket so it will be a tough contest. I'm hosting a lunch so that all of my office can watch the game, but I hope the team that plays the best cricket wins."" Wednesday's showdown will be the biggest fixture between the sporting and political rivals in recent years. The countries have fought three wars since becoming independent from Britain in 1947 and tensions are high after the 2008 attacks carried out by Pakistani militants on the Indian city of Mumbai which killed 166 people. It is not the first time that cricket has united the country's leaders -- in 2005 General Prevez Musharraf watched a match with Singh in Delhi and in 1987 General Zia-ul-Haq accepted Rajiv Gandhi's invitation to watch a game in Jaipur. However, it would be the first visit to India by a Pakistani head of state or government for a decade. ""This is a very positive step. It gives hope to people,"" prominent Pakistan lawyer and human rights activist Asma Jahangi told Indian television network IBN. ""We're coming back to cricket diplomacy. The point is not to win the game but the fact that we are playing together. There is excitement on both sides. The politicians have to take this forward in a meaningful way.""","Indian prime minister has sent an invitation to Pakistani leaders to attend World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Marco Simoncelli hopes he has put his Le Mans nightmare behind him after earning the first pole position of his top-level motorcycling career in Spain on Saturday. The Italian rider was reprimanded by MotoGP chiefs following an incident in France two weeks ago that caused Dani Pedrosa to crash and miss his home race after breaking his collarbone. Simoncelli reportedly received death threats following that collision, which resulted in the 24-year-old finishing fifth after being hit with a ride-through penalty, having been denied his first podium placing. ""This is the best way to forget what happened in Le Mans and what everyone has been saying in the last two weeks, and before this race,"" he said after qualifying first for Sunday's Catalunya Grand Prix near Barcelona. Pedrosa crash overshadows Stoner's French MotoGP success . Simoncelli headed off Le Mans winner Casey Stoner and Yamaha's world champion and series leader Jorge Lorenzo as he set a late lap of one minute 42.413 seconds. Stoner had led for the entire session but was denied his fourth pole position from five attempts this season as he bids to cut Lorenzo's 12-point advantage. ""I'm very satisfied and happy. I didn't expect it because Stoner was faster than me in the other sessions and today we had some problems in the first part of qualifying, but after we chose the right tire for me I could push like I wanted and got this time,"" Simoncelli said. American Ben Spies will lead the second row on the grid from Honda's Andrea Dovizioso and fellow Yamaha rider Cal Crutchlow, while seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi was seventh ahead of Ducati teammate Nicky Hayden of the U.S.","Marco Simoncelli claims pole position for the first time in a MotoGP event .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Zimbabwe's High Court ordered the immediate release Tuesday of six former army officers accused of plotting to topple President Robert Mugabe. The alleged coup plotters have been in prison since 2007, despite several attempts by their lawyers to have them released. Treason carries a death sentence in Zimbabwe. After reading a seven-page ruling, Justice Yunus Omerjee said it was apparent that the defendants should not have been commuted to custody and he said a declaratory order will be issued to that effect. Justice Joseph Musakwa concurred. In July, the High Court dismissed the case because the alleged coup plotters had not been brought to court for trial within six months, as required by law. State prosecutors responded by re-indicting them. The defendants appealed to the High Court to throw out the re-indictment. The man accused of being the ringleader of the alleged coup plot, Albert Matapo, was arrested in 2007, as were six other suspects: Nyasha Zivuku, Oncemore Mazivahona, Emmanuel Marara, Patson Mupfure, Shingirai Mutemachani and Rangarirai Maziofa. They were accused of plotting to violently topple Mugabe and replace him with the country's defense minister, Emerson Mnangagwa. The suspects denied the allegations against them, and one was later released. Their attorneys said if the state wished to pursue the matter, their clients would not be detained. It was not immediately clear what action the state would take.","The men were accused of planning a coup in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Yuvraj Singh held his nerve to steer India into the last four of the World Cup and end Australia's 12-year reign as champions. Yuvraj struck a vital 57 not out to ensure co-hosts India reached their target of 261 with more than two overs to spare and book a semifinal clash with Asian rivals Pakistan. Earlier, captain Ricky Ponting had hit an imperious 104 and Brad Haddin a quickfire 53 as Australia reached a competitive total of 260-5. But half centuries from Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir edged India towards their target before Yuvraj and Suresh Raina propelled them over the line. After the game Yuvraj told Sky Sports: ""The pressure was something else. People say it's just another game, but beating the three-time champions I feel is really special for me and our team."" Defeat came as a bitter blow to Ponting, who has had to field questions about his future both as player and captain throughout the tournament, but he later insisted he wouldn't be stepping down. ""We competed hard, there's no doubt about that,"" he said. ""We thought we were in with a chance at the half-way stage, and that we had a reasonable total. ""But we didn't bowl as well as we needed to, we needed more wickets from the middle order. It's disappointing to be bowing out now. I wish India well for the rest of the tournament."" Australia made a quick start to their innings as Haddin and Shane Watson put on 40 but it was with Ponting's arrival at the crease that the impetus began to grow. Despite a shaky start, Ponting soon punished some wayward Indian bowling to record his first century in 13 months, and despite Michael Clarke, Mike Hussey and Cameron White going cheaply David Hussey added a valuable 38 as Australia made 260-5. India reached 44 in their reply before Virender Sehwag fell but Tendulkar (53) and Gambhir (50) continued the charge with a partnership of 70 before the batsman known as ""the little master"" was dismissed by Shaun Tait. When Virat Kohli and Indian captain MS Dhoni were removed in quick succession, Australia could sense the game changing. But Yuvraj showed plenty of character to lead his side home, despite the calamitous run out of Gambhir. Raina added a vital 34 and when Yuvraj smashed the winning runs it sparked wild scenes of celebration in Ahmedabad. Meanwhile, England spinner Michael Yardy has flown home from the World Cup because he is suffering from depression. The 30-year-old, who took two wickets during his three games at the tournament, said on the England and Wales Cricket Board's website: ""Leaving at this stage of the World Cup campaign was a very difficult decision to make. ""But I felt it was the only sensible option for me and I wanted to be honest about the reason behind that decision."" Hugh Morris, the managing director of England Cricket, said: ""I would like to offer my full support to Michael on behalf of everyone involved with the England team and the ECB. ""Michael has been an integral part of the England set-up in recent years and while he will be missed in the knock out stages of the World Cup, our priority now is to ensure that he returns home to his family and is able to spend time recovering with a strong support network around him.""","India defeat reigning Cricket World Cup champions Australia by five wickets .

"(CNN) -- The alleged ""Barefoot Bandit"" entered a not guilty plea during a federal court appearance Thursday, but a lawyer representing him said attorneys were working on the details of a plea agreement. Colton Harris-Moore gained notoriety and earned his nickname for allegedly leading police on a two-year manhunt while eluding capture in stolen boats, cars and planes -- usually while barefoot. In May, a federal judge added bank burglary to an indictment that contains five other federal charges stemming from Harris-Moore's dramatic July 2010 capture in the Bahamas. Four of the charges are punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. His attorney, John Henry Browne, told reporters a draft of a plea agreement could be finished by the end of the day Thursday. Negotiations for a restitution amount are still under way, he said, adding that the amount will likely be about $1.3 million. Browne stressed that his 20-year-old client wants any money generated from likely book or movie deals to go to the victims. ""There's a lot of interest, there's active negotiations,"" Browne said. ""He really doesn't want publicity, but regardless of whether Colton cooperates or not, there is going to be a movie made about (him), there will be other books written about him. That's going to happen no matter what."" Harris-Moore limped into court Thursday, but Browne noted that his client was smiling and joking. Browne said Harris-Moore is in ""segregation"" because officials are concerned about how he was injured. Browne attributed the limp to an injury Harris-Moore sustained during a volleyball game. As the ""Barefoot Bandit,"" Harris-Moore garnered a loyal and outspoken fan base on Facebook -- at one point amassing more than 50,000 fans. He was arrested in July 2010 after allegedly crashing a stolen plane in the Bahamas and then trying to escape on a stolen boat. He'd been on the run from police since escaping from a Washington group home in 2008. Harris-Moore's trial is scheduled to begin July 11.","Colton Harris-Moore pleads not guilty to six federal charges .

"(CNN) -- For pro-surfers like nine-time world champion Kelly Slater, flying from continent to continent looking for the perfect wave seems like a freewheeling lifestyle, but for amateurs, it requires careful planning. Surfing champ Kelly Slater gains altitude at Hossegor, France, in 2002. Surfers checking out unique vibes at sites in Australia, Fiji, Tahiti, Hawaii and France are driven by the buzz that comes from exhilarating swells, breaking waves and amazing barrel tubes created by truly awesome forces of nature. Unlike other travelers, surfers are interested in surfer-friendly places to crash, snagging the best airline rates for surfboards and where to hang out. Here's Slater's list of five great surfing meccas along with some hints about how to fully enjoy your search for the proverbial endless summer.  See photos of Slater surfing his five great sites » . BANZAI PIPELINE, Oahu, Hawaii . Event: Billabong Pipeline Masters, December 8 to December 20, 2009 . ""I grew up mesmerized by it, and it never lets you down,"" Slater said. ""It's just an amazing place to be and a wave that always challenges you."" The vibe: Surfers compare this event to professional golf's Master's tournament. Since the 1950s and '60s, mobs of fans have traveled to view one of the sport's great venues to watch competing surfers. How to get there: To find this quarter-mile long treasure trove of breaking waves, drive southwest of Ehukai Beach Park along the Kamehameha Highway, about seven miles northeast of Haleiwa. During competition season -- in November and December -- visitors can soak up a lot of action on the beach, said Scott Bass, editor at Surfer Magazine. ""It's a unique spot because a large, crazy death-defying surf breaks only 100 yards from shore. It's very accessible as a viewer,"" said Bass.  See map and more photos of Slater's surfing spots » . Where to stay: Keiki Beach Bungalows offers tourists the best of both worlds: proximity to the Pipeline and a break from the crowds. Located on the beach about a mile away from Pipeline, the quiet bungalows also provide convenient access to a shopping complex with food and coffee shops about a quarter mile away. One and two-bedroom cottages range from $145 to $220 per night, depending on length of stay. Searching for more elegant digs? Turtle Bay Resort offers hundreds of luxurious guest rooms, suites and cottages not far from Pipeline. On a budget? Less than an hour's drive away, campers can pitch near the Pacific at Barbers Point Beach Park. Where to hang out: Got something sweeter in mind? Matsumoto Shave Ice has become a Hawaiian institution during its 60 years, serving the namesake snow cones, candy and crack seed, an island snack of dried fruits. Where to get lunch: Locals will tell you that hanging out on the North Shore must include a stop at some of the island's tried and true mom and pop shops. Macky's Sweet Shrimp Truck is literally just that -- a brightly painted RV parked in a private lot. Macky's specializes in serving succulent shrimp, rice, fruit and veggies. CLOUDBREAK, Tavarua, Fiji . Best waves: April to October . ""One of the great surf discoveries ever,"" said Slater about Cloudbreak, the name given to a surfing reef about two miles off Fiji's island of Tavarua. The South Pacific waters off Fiji offer the perfect temperature and a ""really good swell window"" for timing waves, Slater said. ""The wave has so many different faces to it. It's challenging and perfect."" The vibe: Exclusive. The Tavarua Resort on the island controls access to the reef. How to get there: Surfing Cloudbreak can cost you, both physically and monetarily because of its distance off the island and the expense of traveling to the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Surfers get to the reef on local boats or jet-skis -- or by paddling on their boards, which will take a lot out of you. Where to stay/hang out: Options are very limited. Surfer tourists can expect to spend at least $200 per night at the island resort. SNAPPER ROCKS, Kirra, Australia . Event: Quiksilver Pro Gold Coast February 28 to March 11, 2009 . It's no secret that surfing is a national pastime in Australia, especially during pro-surfing competitions in February and March, when the weather is toasty warm and the water is aqua blue. How to get there: Arrive at the Gold Coast airport at Coolangatta or at the airport in Brisbane, which is about 68 miles (109 kilometers) to the north on the Pacific Motorway. The stretch of breaking waves between Snapper Rocks and Kirra is called the Superbank. The waves are ""perfect, hollow, fast,"" said Slater. Superbank's sandy-bottom, barrel point break makes it worthy of his list. ""On its day, it's the wave you would draw on your school books,"" he said. The vibe: The Gold Coast during competition season is similar to Spring Break in the United States, said Bass, a globetrotting surfer who has produced a documentary about the Vietnam War's surfing soldiers. Gold Coast spectators tend to be young, hip trendy, college-age surf fans. For tourists with wider interests, the scene includes a music festival and skateboard competition. Where to stay: Take your pick. There are plenty of hotels along the Gold Coast, ranging from upscale three or four-star destinations to modest beach motels. For $20 (Australian) you can grab a bunk bed in a backpacker hostel. At the posh Palazzo Versace, you can spend thousands of dollars for one night's lodging. Apartments near the shore run from $80 to $250 Australian per night. Book early if possible. TEAHUPOO, Tahiti . Event: Billabong Pro Teahupoo May 9 to May 20, 2009 . Cloudbreak's remoteness is matched by Tahiti's Teahupoo, which is described by Slater as ""one of the most challenging waves and confronting waves in the world."" When negotiating Teahupoo's South Pacific monster waves, said Slater, ""Just make a decision and follow it. No second guessing."" The vibe: Teahupoo is very exclusive and expensive, according to Bass. ""It's a grand spectacle along the same lines as the Pipeline, just not as accessible."" How to get there: You might have to pay a boater for transportation to the wave, which is about a quarter mile off shore, said Bass. Where to stay/hang out: Small pensions,homes that island residents rent to tourists, are the way to go in Tahiti, said Bass. Hiti Moana Villa offers bungalows for $110 to $160 per night. HOSSEGOR, France . Event: Quiksilver Pro France September 23 to October 4, 2009 . For nonsurfers, Hossegor is a big secret. ""People don't realize how good the surf is there but it's incredible very often,"" said Slater. The elbow-shaped Bay of Biscay near the French-Spanish border offers ""lots of swell and good weather that Ireland and England don't get."" The vibe: More waves, more surfing, less competition. The Hossegor area offers many fine beach breaks that result in abundant waves. These ""peaky"" beach breaks democratize the surfing experience. With more good waves, there's less jockeying among surfers for position. During most of the year, surfers will need to wear a wet suit. The Bay of Biscay is really cold. Where to hang out: The area has great food, according to Slater, and, ""Spain is just right next door for something different."" Across the Spanish border, surfers can discover crashing waves along the shore of San Sebastian, the town made famous in Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises."" Continue down the coast to experience amazing waves off the Spanish towns of Zarautz and Mendexa. There, surfers will discover a pure point break, with waves breaking off cobblestone rocks on the ocean floor. Where to stay: All along the coast are dozens of beach hostels offering low-cost lodging. Also, there's camping in the area, if you feel like really roughing it. The Hortensias du Lac hotel offers rooms from €170 to €220 per night. How to get there: From Paris, drive about 6 hours southwest to Bordeaux and then drive about 2 hours south to Hossegor. By train from Paris takes about 6 hours and costs about $130. TOTING  YOUR BOARD . The relationship between surfers and their boards is close. Sometimes very close. Many surfers feel their boards are like a physical part of them. As a result, they accept no substitutes -- or rentals. They bring their boards. Traveling with a 9-foot, 70-pound piece of sporting equipment can be expensive. Several airlines hit surfboard-toting travelers with stiff fees, sometimes hundreds of dollars. But a few carriers will allow surfboards to be checked as baggage free, within certain guidelines.

"(CNN)  -- WBA champion David Haye has labeled Odlanier Solis a ""fat bum"" after the Cuban boxer suffered a humiliating one-round defeat to his heavyweight rival Vitali Klitschko. The elder Klitschko brother was awarded a technical knockout after just three minutes of his WBC title defense on Saturday night, much to the disappointment of the 19,000-strong crowd ringside in Cologne. Solis, the 2004 Olympic champion, was unbeaten in his last 17 professional fights, but appeared to injured himself after being floored by his 6ft 8in Ukrainian opponent -- who was defending his title for the sixth time in his second reign as WBC champion. Britain's Haye -- who is preparing to face Wladimir Klitschko in a unification bout later this year -- lost to Solis in the amateur ranks 10 years ago and has launched a damning critique of his one-time conqueror. Haye confirms showdown with Klitschko finally on . ""Now that's why you shouldn't have excess body fat! A lean, 30-years-old healthy athlete shouldn't have joints/ligament popping for no reason,"" Haye wrote on his Twitter website page. He continued: ""He beat me 10 years ago when he weighed 46lbs less. He used to be ripped! Why become obese before a huge fight? ""Solis knew how to beat Vit, but years of obesity stopped him being able to execute. He will unfortunately go down as yet another fat bum."" After a promising opening two-and-a-half minutes of the much-anticipated encounter, Solis was caught by a right hook to his temple. Like the crowd, the champion initially seemed angry that Solis could not carry on, but it quickly became clear he had hurt himself as he clutched onto his knee and hamstring while lying on the floor. According to the AFP news agency, it is now believed the 30-year-old has sustained further damage to an already injured leg, and could potentially need surgery to repair the problem. Solis' failed challenge has increased the pressure on Haye to defeat IBF and WBO heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko -- and perhaps even take on the 39-year-old Vitali before his retirement in October -- in order to put an end to the brothers' dominance in the sport. As the build-up to the long-awaited showdown continues, Wladimir, present at his brother's fight in Germany, commented: ""You can see why Haye chose to fight me and not my brother. He was incredible today. ""David is definitely going to say to Vitali, 'I will fight you down the road but Wladimir is next because he is weaker'.""","Odlanier Solis puts up farcical one-round challenge against Vitali Klitschko .

"(CNN) -- Former Ajax and Tottenham manager Martin Jol has taken over as coach at English Premier League club Fulham. The London-based club, who reached the final of UEFA's Europa League in 2009 under Roy Hodgson, moved quickly to replace Mark Hughes, who left the club earlier this month. Jol was approached to take charge when Hodgson left for Liverpool, but opted to stay with Dutch giants Ajax. He has signed a two-year contract with an option to extend by another year. He told the club's official web site: ""I am very happy to join Fulham, a wonderful traditional club. It is a club with good, solid foundations and a great fan base. ""I could have gone to other countries but I was waiting for the opportunity to come back to England."" Fulham qualified for next season's Europa League thanks to their standing in UEFA's Fair Play table, and start their qualifying campaign for the tournament on June 30. Despite coming so soon after the end of the 2010-11 season Jol, who also had a spell with German club Hamburg, insists he is pleased to be in the competition. ""It would be ridiculous to say that I'm not happy with being in the Europa League,"" he added. ""I think Fulham were the first and only club who had a lucrative income from the Europa League. ""Any other team, say in Germany for example, would say that you don't earn a lot of money from the Europa League because only the Champions League is profitable. ""Let's not forget though that can hinder you in the season, the last time Fulham were in the Europa League they were 12th in the table, but it is my hope that we can build a squad that is strong enough to compete in all of these competitions."" The club's chairman, Mohamed Al Fayed, said he was delighted to appoint Jol, the man who led Tottenham to fifth place in the 2005-06 season. ""He understands my vision for the club, and believes in what we are striving to achieve here,"" he said. ""I know that he will dedicate himself to helping us move forward, and is with us for the long term, to help us build and progress."" Meanwhile, Portuguese club Benfica have issued a statement denying that Spanish giants Real Madrid have agreed a deal to sign Fabio Coentrao. The defender has a release clause of $44 million and Spanish media reported Tuesday that Coentrao would be joining this week. But Benfica released a statement on their web site that read: ""Fabio Coentrao is a Benfica player. Unlike the news that came out in the media, fueled, as always, by 'sources' with no name and no face, there is no kind of agreement with Real Madrid. ""The player's release clause is €30 million ($44m) and the potential interested parties know that.""","Martin Jol appointed coach of English Premier League club Fulham .

"(CNN) -- Thomas Aiken will take a two-shot lead heading into Sunday's final round of the Spanish Open at the El Prat Golf Club near Barcelona. The South African who led at the halfway stage shot an even-par round of 72 on a day that was inevitably overshadowed by the death of Seve Ballesteros, who lost his three-year battle with cancer in the early hours of Saturday morning. With flags at half-mast and players donning black ribbons, the European Tour marked the five-time major winner's passing with a minute's silence followed by a round of applause. Among the many players paying their respects to Ballesteros were his long-standing friends and Ryder Cup allies Jose Maria Olazabal and Miguel Angel Jimenez. Colin Montgomerie, who played alongside Olazabal on Saturday said the Spaniard had been in tears for much of the third round. ""He has lost an older brother almost,"" Montgomerie said, EuropeanTour.com reported. After his round, Olazabal reflected on the career of his great golfing companion. ""I don't think there will ever be another player like him. There can be others that are very good, but none will have his charisma,"" Olazabal said, EuropeanTour.com reported. Spain's golfing maestro remembered . Pablo Larrazabal is currently tied for second place on six-under par and the highest placed Spaniard in an event which Ballesteros won three times during his career. ""Since I heard the news this morning I couldn't get it out of my head,"" Larrazabal said, EuropeanTour.com reported. ""It has been a tough day. I was on the eighth during the minute of silence. It was the saddest minute of my career,"" he added. The former Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year has set his sights on winning the tournament on Sunday. ""If I hit the ball well and putt correctly I have a chance to win it and dedicate it to him and to his family,"" Larrazabal said, EuropeanTour.com reported. Along with Aiken, who has yet to win on the European Tour, Larrazabal will have to fend off challenges from the Dane Anders Hansen -- who shot a three-under par 69 on Saturday to tie for second place -- and France's Romain Wattel and Scotland's Scott Jamieson who are also tied for second.","South African leads by two after third round of Spanish Open .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams will return to competitive tennis after nearly a year on the sidelines in the WTA tournament at Eastbourne, which starts Saturday. The former world number one has endured a torrid time since being sidelined with a foot injury after winning her fourth Wimbledon crown last July. Several aborted attempts at a comeback were followed by a major health scare in February as she suffered a blood clot on her lung. It led to speculation that her glittering career could be over, but Williams has recovered to take her place as a wild card in the grass court event at the south coast of England resort. ""I am so excited to be healthy enough to compete again,"" she told the tournament's official website. ""These past twelve months have been extremely tough and character building. I have so much to be grateful for. I'm thankful to my family, friends, and fans for all of their support. Serena's back!"" Serena will be joined in the traditional pre-Wimbledon warm-up tournament by her older sister Venus, who is also returning to action after an extended injury layoff. Venus has been sidelined since injuring her hip at the Australian Open in January. They will take their place in a top-class line-up which has 13 of the top 20 players in the WTA world rankings, including new French Open champion Li Na of China. 13-time grand slam champion Serena returned to practice in April, but decided against returning for the second grand slam season of the season in Paris. Eastbourne tournament director Gavin Fletcher said she would be guaranteed a warm welcome at their event. ""Eastbourne has always had a huge soft spot for Serena, and people here will be absolutely thrilled that she's back playing world class tennis,"" he said. The 29-year-old has slipped to No.25 in the world rankings in her absence but should she come through Eastbourne unscathed, Wimbledon organizers could seed her higher due to previous performances on grass. Meanwhile, top seed Roger Federer has pulled out of this week's grass court tournament in Halle, Germany. Federer, beaten in the final of the French Open Sunday by Rafael Nadal, was due to play Australian Lleyton Hewitt in the first round but did not want to risk a groin injury ahead of his Wimbledon challenge. Hewitt, who beat Federer in last year's final at Halle, will now play a lucky loser in the first round.","Serena Williams to return to competitive tennis at Eastbourne tournament .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan will likely need two to three more months to bring an end to the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a nuclear industry official said Saturday. Takashi Sawada, the deputy director of the Atomic Energy Society of Japan, said Saturday that it was likely to take that long to restore normal cooling systems for the damaged reactors at Fukushima Daiichi. The plant's coolant systems were knocked out by the March 11 tsunami, causing three reactors to overheat and producing what Japan's government has designated a top-scale nuclear accident. Sawada's organization is an association of nuclear engineers, scientists and professors, and it issued a Friday report that he called ""our best effort to imagine what the core looks like."" That report concluded that the zirconium alloy sheaths that surround the reactor's fuel rods ruptured in the three units, sending pellets of molten uranium tumbling to the bottom of the reactors. The pellets are since believed to have cooled and solidified at the reactor bases, according to the report. The plant's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, has said it can't provide a timeline for bringing the crisis to an end and would not discuss Sawada's assessment Saturday. ""We are trying to do our utmost at this moment,"" a company official told CNN. But an adviser to Prime Minister Naoto Kan said the government wants to see some sort of plan by the end of April. ""We will set up a goal for the cooling process soon,"" the adviser, Goshi Hosono, said during an appearance on the BS Asahi satellite network Saturday morning. Japanese nuclear regulators declared the Fukushima Daiichi accident a Level 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale this week, putting the crisis on par with the April 1986 fire and explosion at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union. While authorities said the amount of radioactivity released was only 10 percent of the amount that spewed from Chernobyl, it was far beyond the threshold for a Level 7 event. More than 78,000 people who lived within 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of the plant were ordered to flee their homes. Another 60,000-plus living in the next 10 kilometers were told to shelter indoors, And Japan's government ordered residents of several towns outside that danger zone that they would soon be evacuating due to the possibility of long-term health risks from radioactive particles released from the plant. Tokyo Electric has said it has to drain highly radioactive water from the basements and service tunnels of the reactor units' turbine plants before it can work on restoring normal cooling systems. But workers are also pumping up to 7 tons (1,850 gallons) of water into the reactors every hour as an interim measure, and an unknown portion of that is leaking back into the plant. At the plant on Saturday, workers continued preparations to start pumping water from the No. 2 turbine plant into a treatment facility for low-level radioactive waste. More than 9,000 tons of less-contaminated water that had been held there was dumped into the Pacific Ocean last week in what Japanese officials called an emergency measure to make room for fluid that had been leaking into the sea until April 6. Crews have been laying fresh pipes to the treatment center and hope to start transferring water from unit 2 on Sunday, the company said. But its capacity could be only a fraction of the volume now sloshing around in the turbine building basements, and engineers are still pouring hundreds of tons of water into the reactors every day to keep them cool. The treatment center could hold up to 30,000 tons of water, Tokyo Electric said -- but that could be only a fraction of the volume now sloshing around in the turbine building basements, the company said.","Industry group report says normal cooling may take 2 to 3 months .

"(CNN) -- Germany made it seven wins out of seven with a comfortable victory over Azerbaijan to put themselves on the brink of qualification for Euro 2012. Goals from Mesut Ozil, Mario Gomez and Andre Schurrle helped Joachim Loew's side to a 3-1 triumph in Baku as they moved 11 points clear in qualifying Group A. It would take an unlikely series of events for them to be caught by second placed Turkey, who have a game in hand on their rivals. Real Madrid midfielder Ozil was first to find the net, collecting Benedikt Hoewedes' cross before firing a drive into the corner. Ozil was the architect for Germany's second, as he slid a pass through for Gomez to double the lead. Azerbaijan managed to pull a goal back in the final minute of the match through Murad Huseynov but Schurrle put the game beyond doubt in injury time. In Group E, Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a hat-trick for Sweden as they thumped Finland 5-0. Ibrahimovic came on as a substitute in the first half and registered his hat-trick within 22 minutes. Kim Kallstrom and Emir Bajrami added the other goals.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- A Cuban court has convicted 14 government officials and businessmen and a Chilean entrepreneur for corruption and bribery involving the state-owned airline and a tourism agency. Marcel Marambio, a Chilean businessman with close ties to the Communist government, was sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison for bribery, fraud and falsification of documents, according to a notice published in state media on Tuesday. Marambio was president of Sol Y Son, a tourism agency jointly owned by the Cuban state and Chilean investors. His brother Max Marambio, a long-time friend of Fidel Castro, was sentenced in absentia in a separate corruption trial earlier this year. The 14 Cubans, all employed by Cubana de Aviacion airline or Sol Y Son, were sentenced to between three and 10 years of prison. State media said they were convicted because they received ""cash bribes and personal perks"" but did not provide details about what they provided in exchange. Courts have launched a number of corruption cases since President Raul Castro assumed the presidency of Cuba in 2008.","A Chilean businessman had close ties to the government .

"(CNN)  -- Arsenal revived their English Premier League title hopes with a 3-1 win at relegation battlers Blackpool Sunday. The victory moved Arsene Wenger's men to within seven points of leaders Manchester United, with a further game in hand. Arsenal were forced to field 41-year German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann after Manuel Almunia was injured in the warm-up but they were largely in command after first half goals from Abou Diaby and Emmanuel Eboue. Gary Taylor-Fletcher pulled one back for Blackpool in the 52nd minute when he scored after referee Lee Mason waved played on when Lehmann rushed off his line to foul DJ Campbell. If the penalty had been awarded, Lehmann a former Gunners favorite, might have well been given his marching orders. After some nervous moments, a late strike from Robin van Persie, with the home side appealing for offside, clinched their first win in four league games. Manchester United must travel to the Emirates on May 1 but Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is more concerned about upcoming games. ""We must win the game in hand. But let's first win our next game against Liverpool on Sunday,"" he told Sky Sports. Wenger was full of praise for Lehmann on his second Arsenal debut after his return from retirement to help them out with a goalkeeping shortage. ""Jens can be very proud. The way he practises every day is outstanding. ""He has helped the club win a big game and it will have an impact at the end of the season. He's intelligent and committed."" Blackpool, who were hot favorites to return to the second flight at the first time of asking, remain in 17th spot, just above the drop zone. In Sunday's other EPL game, Aston Villa eased their relegation fears with a 1-0 home win over Newcastle. James Collins scored the only goal of the game in the first half as Gerard Houillier's men moved five points clear of the drop zone, but they had to survive some nervous moments as the visitors carved out a number of openings.","Arsenal win 3-1 at Blackpool to close to within seven points of EPL leaders Man Utd .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Returning from a trip to Pyongyang, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il ready for a summit with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak at any time. Carter did not personally meet with Kim, but he said that as he and his delegation of former heads of state were on the way to Pyongyang airport to depart for South Korea, they were summoned back to their guesthouse, where a senior official read out a written message from the reclusive leader. ""Chairman Kim sent word that he is willing to negotiate with South Korea or United States ... on any subject at any time and without any preconditions,"" Carter told a news conference. ""He specifically told us he is prepared for a summit directly with President Lee Myung-bak at any time to discuss issues between the two heads of state."" The dramatic declaration puts Lee on the spot: Seoul is currently declining official dialogue with North Korea until it takes responsibility for two fatal incidents last year. In 2010, 50 South Koreans were killed in the two separate incidents: South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors. In November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. North Korea denies the torpedo attack on the warship Cheonan, though a Seoul-led international investigation has found a North Korean mini-submarine responsible. Following a range of nuclear and missile tests, and Pyongyang's exposure last November of a uranium-based nuclear program -- a separate program from its earlier plutonium-based program -- the Obama administration is sanctioning Pyongyang and has also put official contacts on hold. Asked if he expected Pyongyang to apologize to Seoul, Carter said; ""My own assessment is that talks should begin without preconditions on either side. My opinion is North Koreans will not admit culpability for the sinking of the Cheonan and will not apologize."" Carter, 86 and his group had met North Korea's de facto head of state Kim Yong Nam, as well as its vice defense minister and foreign minister and other officials. The visit had been intended to promote North-South dialogue, revive a denuclearization process, and assess food shortages. The delegation included former president of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, former Prime Minister of Norway, Gro Brundtland, and former president of Ireland, Mary Robinson. They are all members of ""The Elders"" a group of retired leaders founded by former South African leader Nelson Mandela who undertake peace-building initiatives and non-state diplomacy. Regarding Kim's offer of dialogues, Carter said: ""The Elders' desire is that under some circumstances, these offers will be accepted by the leaders of South Korea, the United States and other leaders of the six-party talks."" The six-party talks are a Beijing sponsored initiative to denuclearize the peninsula; the parties are China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the United States. Following North Korean nuclear and missile tests, they have been in limbo for two years. As for why he had not been able to meet Kim Jong Il personally, Carter responded: ""We did request a chance to meet with him, and we did request an opportunity to meet with the president of South Korea. Neither were available to meet with us."" With North Korea suffering major food shortages, the Elders strongly suggested South Korea and the United States resume food aid to the ultra-nationalist state. ""We would urge you here in South Korea as we will urge the EU and the U.S. to realize there is a very severe crisis,"" said Robinson. ""The humanitarian issues must be disconnected from matters of political concern. It is a matter of life and death urgency."" There had been criticism of Carter in South Korea for not raising human rights issues with the North, even though he did exactly that with South Korean leaders of the authoritarian governments of the 1970s and 80s. Asked by a South Korean reporter if he had raised this issue with the North, Carter took a swipe at South Korean and U.S. policies. ""There are human right issues that relate to the policies of the North Korean government that I don't think any of us on the outside can change,"" he said. ""But one of the most important human rights is to have food to eat and for South Korea and Americans, and others to deliberately to withhold food aid for North Korean people because of military or political issues unrelated is indeed a human rights violation."" Carter added that he believes that there are no longer any impediments to food aid monitoring. In the past, some governments and non-governmental organizations have criticized Pyongyang for not permitting them to monitor their aid deliveries, raising suspicions that shipments could be going to the military, rather than to the most vulnerable populations. Brundtland, who is an ex-World Food Programme director, noted that one third of North Korean children are stunted due to malnutrition, and one in five is underweight. Ahtisaari suggested that the resumption of dialogue is essential. ""I think it is extremely important that we as Elders can recommend that there is, as early as possible, a resumption of dialogue on all outstanding issues,"" he said. ""I sincerely hope that parties can agree on a time frame in which to resolve these problems instead of a process that can last forever."" In South Korea, where North Korean defectors have alleged the existence of concentration camps, torture and the imprisonment of family members, Carter's message on human rights and his linkage to food aid is likely to raise hackles. ""For the South Korean audience, we need to hear that he raised the human rights issue with North Korea as he did in South Korea during the 1970s and 80s, that would bring more credibility,"" said Won Jae-chun, a director general at Seoul's National Human Rights Commission of Korea. ""I don't think his message will go far in [South] Korea."" Carter and his delegation will be hosted at a banquet by South Korea's foreign minister Thursday evening. However, a representative of the Blue House, the South Korean presidency, said Wednesday that it considered Carter's trip that of ""private individuals."" Carter has a history of private diplomacy on the peninsula. In 1994, after Pyongyang had expelled international nuclear inspectors and threatening to turn Seoul into a ""sea of fire"" and with the United States mulling air strikes on North Korean facilities, Carter flew into Pyongyang to meet Kim Il Sung. That set the scene for the so-called ""Agreed Framework"" in which North Korea would give up its nuclear facilities in return for light water reactors from the international community. That deal foundered after Washington accused North Korea of having a secret uranium based nuclear program. North Korea denied it at the time -- only to publicly reveal a uranium-based program last year. Last year, another Carter visit to Pyongyang resulted in the freeing of an American citizen held there. However, he had no opportunity to discuss strategic issues, because he was not met by Kim Jong Il. Journalist Andrew Salmon contributed to this report .","The Elders visited the Korean Peninsula .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo has claimed the referee ""didn't let"" his Real Madrid team win Tuesday's European Champions League semifinal second leg against archrivals Barcelona. Real could only draw 1-1 at the Camp Nou, losing 3-1 on aggregate after last week's controversial 2-0 defeat to Barca in Madrid which left both clubs facing charges from ruling body UEFA. It was the two teams' fourth meeting in 18 days -- clashes known as ""El Clasico"" -- and tensions between the clubs have become strained in that period, with allegations of foul play and racism being made. There was further controversy on Tuesday, when Real saw a 48th-minute goal from Argentina forward Gonzalo Higuain ruled out by referee Frank de Bleeckere after Ronaldo was adjudged to have fouled Javier Mascherano. Barca held but go through to Champions League final . ""Once again it was the referee that didn't allow us to dictate the outcome,"" Ronaldo, who became the world's most expensive player when he moved to the Bernabeu from Manchester United in 2009, told Real's official website. ""We knew we could beat Barca, but the referee didn't let us. Higuain's goal was good. Pique pushed me and I landed on Mascherano. He didn't used to fall to the ground in England, but he's picked up the bad habit of doing it here like everyone else."" Josep Guardiola's Barca took the lead on the night when Spain forward Pedro coolly converted after a pass from compatriot Andres Iniesta on 54 minutes. Real, without head coach Jose Mourinho after he was sent to the stands in the first leg, equalized through Brazil's Marcelo in the 65th minute following a shot from Angel Di Maria that rattled the post. Los Blancos were left frustrated after last week's first leg, when they felt Portugal defender Pepe was wrongly dismissed for a challenge on Dani Alves. Has the time arrived for change in football? ""The referee in the first match took away our chances of playing the final,"" Pepe's fellow Portugal international Ronaldo said. ""Whoever knows anything about football knows that Barcelona get preferential treatment. We knew something would happen. We knew that if we scored a goal that everything would be done to keep us from going through. ""This isn't good for football. We should just stay home and allow Barcelona to play alone if things don't change."" Guardiola has guided the Catalan club to the second final in Europe's premier club competition under his stewardship and a third in five years. Barca secured the first of three Champions League triumphs at London's Wembley Stadium in 1992, a match Guardiola played in, and will return to the rebuilt venue for the May 28 showpiece. ""Taking into account what these players have come through, it's incredible,"" the 40-year-old told UEFA's website. ""They just keep going and going. I give my thanks to every one of them; what they have achieved is beyond definition. We won our first European Cup in Wembley and now we are going in search of our fourth."" Barca look likely to face Manchester United in a repeat of the 2009 final in Rome, after the English Premier League leaders defeated German outfit Schalke 2-0 in their semifinal first-leg tie on April 26. The two teams meet again at United's Old Trafford on Wednesday. ""I'm not sure who we will face but I imagine it will be Manchester United,"" Guardiola said.

It would be an honor for me, a young coach, to reach the final against him.""","Cristiano Ronaldo says referee did not let Real Madrid beat Barcelona .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Less than two months before voters are expected to go to the polls in national elections, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan Wednesday announced ambitious plans to dig a new canal through Istanbul that would bypass the existing Bosphorus Strait. ""Today we are rolling up our sleeves for one of the biggest projects of the century, which will outshine the Panama and Suez Canals,"" Erdogan said at a party conference. The proposed Istanbul Canal would run for more than 45 kilometers, or about 28 miles, from the Black Sea through Turkey's largest city and commercial capital, to the Marmara Sea -- roughly parallel to the Bosphorus Strait, the natural body of water that already bisects Istanbul. The Panama Canal is 77 kilometers (roughly 48 miles) in length, while the Suez Canal in Egypt is more than 190 kilometers (118 miles) long. Erdogan said one of the goals of the proposed canal would be to reduce the huge amount of international cargo ships that regularly traverse the congested Bosphorus. ""One of the most important reasons for this project will be to reduce Bosphorus traffic and minimize threats,"" Erdogan said, in comments published on the prime minister's official web-site. More than a 100 ships a day sail up and down the Bosphorus. Many of them carry dangerous cargos of crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The fast currents and narrow bends in the historic channel have led to several accidents on the banks of Turkey's most populous city. The deadliest incident took place in 1979, when a Romanian oil tanker exploded after colliding with another vessel, killing dozens of people and leaking tons of oil into the sea. In his speech Wednesday, Erdogan conceded that critics in the Turkish media had referred to his plan as a ""crazy project."" ""With this project, there will be two seas running through Istanbul,"" he said, adding that the canal would result in the creation of a man-made island and another peninsula. The prime minister said the proposed canal would be 145 meters (475 feet) wide and 25 meters (82 feet) deep. But he stopped short of announcing the exact route of the proposed waterway. The location and financing of the project would be kept secret, Erdogan said, to ""prevent any negativity and unfairness and injustice.""","The proposed canal will be 45 kilometers long, the prime minister says .

"(WIRED) -- Android chief Andy Rubin took to the blogs Wednesday evening to combat recent reports of Google clamping down on Android's openness. ""We continue to be an open source platform and will continue releasing source code when it is ready,"" wrote Rubin on the Android Developer Blog. ""As I write this the Android team is still hard at work to bring all the new Honeycomb features to phones. As soon as this work is completed, we'll publish the code. This temporary delay does not represent a change in strategy."" Google has championed its platform as the open alternative to Apple's closed iOS system. That openness has been called into question recently, as Google has yet to release the Honeycomb source code to all developers and manufacturers. Honeycomb is Android's first tablet-optimized software release. Rubin cites the difference in form factor between tablets and phones as the reason Google hasn't released Honeycomb's source code to device manufacturers and developers. Motorola is the exception: The company's Honeycomb-fueled Xoom tablet has been on the market for more than a month, which makes Google's decision to hold the code from wide release a bit mystifying. Members of the Android industry showed faith in Google, however. ""They say they're going to release it, I'm not gonna call them liars,"" Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin told WIRED.com in an interview. The Android OS is based on a version of the Linux OS, which has been an open source, collaborative platform since its release decades ago. Rubin's post also addressed questions raised in a recent Bloomberg story about Android's level of control over its partners. Bloomberg wrote: . Over the past few months, according to several people familiar with the matter, Google has been demanding that Android licensees abide by ""non-fragmentation clauses"" that give Google the final say on how they can tweak the Android code -- to make new interfaces and add services -- and in some cases whom they can partner with. Rubin combats this claim directly, stating Google's so-called ""anti-fragmentation program has been in place since Android 1.0,"" citing a list of compatibility requirements manufacturers must adhere to in order to market a device as ""Android-compatible."" He's referring to Android's compatibility test suite, or CTS, an automated litmus test to measure whether or not a piece of hardware can claim to run Android. ""Our approach remains unchanged: There are no lock-downs or restrictions against customizing UIs,"" wrote Rubin. Motorola vouches for Rubin's statement. ""In the time since we've started working with Google, our relationship has matured, but it isn't any more limiting than it ever has been,"" Christy Wyatt, Motorola's VP of mobile software development, told Wired.com. ""I don't believe that anything has changed in the CTS since the beginning."" Finally, Rubin emphatically denied other rumors of ARM-chipset standardization in the platform, much of which arose in the wake of an anonymously sourced DigiTimes story. ""There are not, and never have been, any efforts to standardize the platform on any single chipset architecture,"" Rubin wrote. With the Nexus One, Google's first flagship phone, the company worked with Qualcomm to install its 1-GHz Snapdragon ARM processors in the HTC-manufactured handsets. The subsequent Nexus S came equipped with Samsung's 1-GHz Hummingbird processor, which is also based on ARM architecture. It's out of character for Rubin and Android to post such a defensive update. Rumors circulating in the media are usually given a brusque ""no comment"" by Google's communications team. But the title of Rubin's post -- ""I think I'm having a Gene Amdahl moment"" -- explains it all. Amdahl coined the acronym FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) in 1975. After leaving IBM to form his own IT company, Amdahl claimed he suffered attacks by IBM sales staff attempting to undermine his new venture. All of this negative attention isn't good for Android's ""open"" image, and maybe that's what overcame Rubin's reluctance to speak: too much FUD about Android's future. Whether or not this FUD is warranted, however, remains to be seen. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- Demonstrations swelled in several cities across Yemen on Friday, a week after the country's president was injured in an attack on the mosque at the presidential palace. In Sanaa, demonstrators participating in a large protest against President Ali Abdullah Saleh's continued rule could be heard chanting ""Saleh will fall"" and ""The end is near for Saleh,"" according to eyewitnesses. In a separate large protest in the city, pro-government demonstrators carried signs of Saleh and chanted, ""We are with you, Saleh,"" according to witnesses. Another large demonstration was occurring in Taiz, according to witnesses. Protests were also under way in Ibb and Mukalla, witnesses said. Yemen has been consumed with unrest for months as protesters demand an end to Saleh's rule. In recent weeks, government troops have battled both anti-government tribal forces and Islamic militants. On June 3, the presidential compound was attacked, injuring Saleh and other senior officials. They went to Saudi Arabia for treatment. Tareq al-Shami, a spokesman for the ruling party said Saleh was in good health and would be returning to Yemen ""within days."" The government has also been battling Islamic militants, including in Zinjibar, an Abyan province town that had been taken over by militants. Yemeni state TV said this week that the government had ousted the militants from Zinjibar. A six-nation Gulf Arab alliance has tried to broker a government-opposition agreement that would lead to Saleh's departure, but that effort has so far been unsuccessful. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.","Demonstrations swell Friday in several Yemen cities .

"Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso (CNN) -- In the latest shake-up following weeks of popular unrest and sporadic violence, the top two political figures in Burkina Faso announced on the state-run media outlet that they'd fired 24 Cabinet ministers and formed a new, smaller government. President Blaise Compaore and newly appointed Prime Minister Luc-Adolphe Tiao said Thursday night on Radio Television of Burkina that there will be 29 people in the new Cabinet, down from the 38 in place previously. The full rationale for the shuffling wasn't immediately made clear. Tiao is expected to take questions from the press in the coming days. Besides ousting 24 ministers, the two men also said they have brought 15 different individuals into the administration. In addition, Compaore will serve as defense minister as well as president. Djibril Bassole will become the landlocked West African nation's foreign affairs minister -- a position he'd earlier held, before being tapped as the joint United Nations-African Union mediator for the crisis in Darfur, Sudan. The country's sitting foreign minister, Bedouma Alain Yoda, was among those left out in the new arrangement. The ministers for culture and tourism, infrastructure, health, education, environment, youth, social action and animal resources also have not been retained, according to Compaore and Tiao. The new government combines several Cabinet branches. Among those, the telecommunication ministry joins with that of transportation, security comes into the ministry of administration, and the human rights ministry becomes part of the justice ministry. This news came two days after Compaore tapped Tiao, Burkina Faso's former ambassador to France, as prime minister -- a report also broadcast on the national radio and television network. All these moves follow several recent breakouts of popular discord and violence in the African nation. Student protests have been ongoing in the nation since February, according to local media reports. These demonstrations came after a student reportedly died in jail. On March 30, protests erupted over a court case. According to media reports, a man sued a group of five soldiers, claiming they forced him to take off his clothes and walk home because he had dated a soldier's girlfriend. The court found in favor of the man. During the violence that ensued, the defense minister said, his home was attacked. A small group of presidential security guards revolted April 14over a disputed housing allowance that they said the president had promised them. They fired shots inside the presidential compound and took to the streets, shooting guns, stealing cars and robbing people, according to defense ministry officials. Two children of a defense official were shot at in the melee and were hospitalized, officials said. The defense ministry issued a statement the following day saying the soldiers had been paid. And Moussa Ag Abdoulaye, a spokesman for a group of security guards, said on state-run TV that its members remained committed to Compaore and called for a cease-fire. Still the protests continued, during which buildings in the capital city, Ouagadougou, were set on fire. The president also reportedly replaced the head of the nation's army amid the violence. The president was at the palace when the demonstrations began and left briefly under heavy security, but he later returned. In recent days, a curfew was imposed, and sources in the city of Po said violence was also taking place there.","Burkina Faso's president and prime minister announce a new government on state-run TV .

"(CNN) -- A 15-year-old was convicted in the 2009 beating death of a Chicago honors student that was caught on video, Cook County Circuit Court officials said Thursday. Jurors deliberated only 30 minutes before convicting the teen of first-degree murder Wednesday in the death of Derrion Albert, CNN affiliate WGN reported. The defendant is not named because he is a juvenile. Sentencing has been set for January 18, court officials said. When the verdict was announced, the 15-year-old threw his hands up and fell back into his chair. His aunt ran out of the courtroom screaming, WGN reported. Authorities said Albert, 16, was an innocent bystander who ended up in the middle of a street fight between two factions of students from Christian Fenger Academy High School. When school let out on September 24, 2009, Albert was nearly six blocks away and on his way to a bus stop when two groups of students converged on the street, authorities said at the time. The factions began fighting after an earlier shooting that police called gang-related. Albert was approached by two members of one faction and struck in the head with a long portion of a wooden railroad tie, then punched in the face, Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for Cook County prosecutors, has said. After losing consciousness briefly, Albert woke up and tried to move from the fight, but was then attacked by members of the opposing faction, Simonton said. The 15-year-old was the first of five defendants charged in Albert's death, WGN said. The other four are charged as adults. ""The facts are the facts, and the prosecutors did a great job,"" Albert's grandfather, Norman Golliday, told WGN. ""I expected (the verdict) to be just what it was."" The trial of the juvenile contained graphic evidence, WGN reported. Police showed the wooden board used to knock Albert to the ground and contended the teen was the one who punched him in the face. The medical examiner showed pictures of the boy's body and testified he died of brain trauma caused in part by the defendant's blow. At times, Albert's family left the courtroom in tears, according to the station. The defense attorney claimed his client, who was 14 at the time of Albert's death, was part of the fight, but maintained he did not deliver the blow that killed Albert, WGN said. Albert's death prompted President Barack Obama, a longtime Chicago resident, to send Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder to the city to meet with school officials, the students and the community on the topic of school violence.","NEW: Sentencing will be January 18 .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- A separatist rebel group claimed responsibility Friday for an ambush on a convoy connected with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. At the time of the attack Wednesday, Erdogan was not in the convoy, which had been traveling to a campaign rally, and he was airlifted to his next stop in a helicopter. A policeman was killed and another was injured in the attack, Erdogan said Wednesday. In a statement e-mailed to CNN, the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, claimed responsibility for the ambush in the province of Kastamonu. The statement reads: ""On 4 May at 17:15 hours, our guerrillas carried an action against a police vehicle in a vehicles convoy at 25th km of the Kastomonu-Ankara Highway skirts of the Mount Ilgaz. This action carried out in retaliation against the police terror against civilian population."" The attack was in northern Turkey, between the cities of Kastamonu and Cankiri. A bomb exploded in front of the police vehicles escorting the ruling Justice and Development Party bus after it made a stop in Kastamonu. Erdogan and his contingent were on a campaign trip ahead of parliamentary elections, expected to be held on June 12. PKK rebels have been battling the Turkish state since the early 1980s. More than 30,000 people, most of them ethnic Kurds, have been killed in the conflict. Riots erupted in Turkey's largest city, Istanbul, last month, after Turkey's electoral board issued a controversial decision to ban several Kurdish politicians from running for office. The electoral board later reversed its decision. Addressing a rally in Amasya, Erdogan expressed sorrow about the death and blamed the attack on separatist groups. ""These dark minds who do not believe in democracy's struggle. These terrorists, these separatist forces believe they can only achieve results this way instead of through the ballot box,"" the prime minister said.","The Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, claims responsibility .

"(CNN) -- Banned Pakistani cricketer Mohammad Amir could face more disciplinary action from the sport's governing body amid reports he took part in a village match in England. The 19-year-old fast bowler was forbidden from taking part in all forms of cricket for five years in February after being found guilty of deliberately bowling no balls in the spot-fixing scandal that engulfed Pakistan's series with England last year. Amir insisted that he was told his appearance for Surrey village side Addington 1743 would not violate his ban because it was a friendly match. But the International Cricket Council have confirmed to CNN that they will be investigating the incident and could mete out further punishment. Colin Gibson, the ICC's Head of Media and Communications, said, ""We are investigating and awaiting the details. If true, it is clearly a breach of the sanction imposed in February. ""The ban is absolutely worldwide covering all levels and any activities connected with cricket. What might happen next is a hypothetical question at this stage."" British newspaper The Daily Star reported Wednesday that Amir played in the game against St Luke's and took four wickets before scoring 60 runs with the bat. He is said to have left before the end of the match. Two of Amir's teammates, former Pakistan captain Salman Butt and bowler Mohammad Asif were also banned by the ICC, for ten and seven years respectively, for their part in the gambling ring. Quotes from Amir appeared on Pakistani cricket web site  PakPassion.net on which he is reported to have said: ""I was informed by club representatives before the game that it was a friendly match, being played on a privately owned cricket ground. ""I asked the club representatives if the match fell under the jurisdiction of the ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) and they informed me that the match did not. ""I spoke to several club representatives about the issue, and they all told me that it was a friendly match and therefore would not contravene my ban from the ICC. I would not be stupid enough to knowingly play in a match that I knew would contravene my ban. ""Wherever I am going to play cricket, the world will know about it. I would not be stupid enough to play in a match where I knew that I would be taking a risk."" Meanwhile, the ICC confirmed England wicketkeeper Matt Prior has been ""reprimanded"" for smashing a window at Lord's after being run out during the second Test match with Sri Lanka. Prior was angry at being dismissed and hurled his bat down in the dressing room, causing another bat to smash the window, shattering glass on several spectators and allegedly cutting the ankle of a member of the crowd. Prior apologized immediately, and the ICC acknowledged that the incident was ""purely accidental and without malice,"" though they could still fine the player up to 50 percent of his match fee. England team director Andy Flower saw the incident and told the ECB's official web site: ""There was no real malicious intent at all. He was a little frustrated and shoved his bat in the corner, and it knocked around and bounced off one or two other bats and hit the pane of glass. ""It was a freak accident but definitely an accident. It is a shame that people will think anything other than that. It is not a major incident by any stretch of the imagination, and everybody should put it behind them really. ""If there was more to it, then of course it should be taken further. But there really is not.""","ICC to investigate reports Mohammad Amir took part in a village game in England .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- City officials in New York have denied Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's request to visit the site of the destroyed World Trade Center next week, a police spokesman said Wednesday. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked to visit ground zero, but New York city officials said no. The controversial, outspoken president wanted to ""pay his respects"" and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al Qaeda attacks during his visit to the U.N. General Assembly, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said, citing Iranian officials. But workers are rebuilding the foundations of the site, ""and it would not be possible for him to go where other people don't go,"" Kelly told CNN. Iranian officials have not put in any additional requests to visit the public platforms at ground zero, police spokesman Paul Browne told CNN. But, he said, ""If there were a further request, we'd reject it"" because of security fears.  Watch why New York said no to Iranian leader » . The Iranian mission to the U.N. said it had not been told of the decision, but in a statement issued Wednesday evening, it called the rejection ""unfortunate."" Iran is ruled by a Shiite Muslim government hostile to the fundamentalist Sunni al Qaeda. Ahmadinejad's predecessor at the time of the September 11 attacks, Mohammed Khatami, condemned them, and Tehran cooperated with the U.S.-led campaign to topple al Qaeda's Taliban allies in Afghanistan that followed. The United States and Iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after Iranian militants stormed the United States Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage for 444 days. The United States considers Iran a state sponsor of terrorism and has accused the country of meddling in Iraq and in Afghanistan where U.S. troops are battling Taliban and al Qaeda remnants more than six years after the September 11, 2001, attacks. More than 2,700 people died in the attack on the World Trade Center, when al Qaeda terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers. A third jet hit the Pentagon, and a fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers resisted their hijackers. ""It is appalling that President Ahmadinejad, one of the world's leading sponsors of terror, would find it appropriate to visit this hallowed ground,"" State Department spokesman Tom Casey said. Several presidential candidates also condemned the requested visit. Hillary Clinton, the New York senator and Democratic front-runner, called the request ""unacceptable."" Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a leading Republican, called it ""shockingly audacious."" And former Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- whose leadership after the attacks is the cornerstone of his GOP presidential bid -- said that ""under no circumstances"" should Ahmadinejad be allowed to visit the World Trade Center site. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said the site should not be ""used as a photo op."" Numerous critics have attacked Ahmadinejad's hard-line anti-Israel stance and his insistence that Iran will defy U.N. demands that it halt its production of enriched uranium. Iran insists it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian power plants, but Washington accuses Tehran of trying to produce a nuclear bomb. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- World leaders and jubilant Americans on Monday acclaimed the news of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's death in a raid by U.S. military forces on a compound in Pakistan. But the chatter on the radical websites that bin Laden's terrorist network used to speak to the world mourned his passing with an edge of defiance, celebrating him as a martyr and vowing al Qaeda will continue despite its leader's death. ""Congratulations for dying as a martyr and a fighter in the sake of Allah,"" one poster wrote. ""We won't cry today, but we will revenge. Men and women in America will cry."" another post read, echoing warnings from Western leaders that the terrorist network will almost certainly move to avenge bin Laden's death. The sites, frequented by radical Islamists who subscribed to bin Laden's philosophies, have played a significant role in attracting and radicalizing potential terror recruits and the broader radical Islamist community and have been frequently used by al Qaeda and its affiliates to broadcast statements. Video and audio messages purported to be from bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, his second-in-command, have shown up for years on jihadist websites to exhort followers to keep the faith and continue their fight against the West. Many of the Web posters on Monday reacted to bin Laden's death by referring to him as a ""shaheed,"" or martyr. One was headlined ""The Lion of Jihad was killed in a fierce battle."" Some mourned. ""Teary eyes and sad hearts go out to you, the dearest and most noble of people."" one poster wrote. Others celebrated bin Laden's death as a promotion of sorts. ""May Allah increase your rank in Jannah o Sheikh Osama!"" one poster wrote. Jannah can be translated as ""paradise."" ""May Allah give you a place next to our beloved Prophet (saws), amen amen,"" wrote another. ""Saws"" is an abbreviation for the phrase meaning ""peace be upon him."" Not everyone could believe what they were hearing. ""The news came down on my ears this morning like thunderbolt,"" one poster commented. Another simply hoped the reports were lies. Web messages attributed to bin Laden have touched on several issues. He urged Muslims to tackle famine and other problems plaguing parts of the Muslim world and made assorted threats against the West. The speaker made reference to a range of jihadi battlegrounds, such as Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel and the Palestinian territories, . Messages had been posted as late as January 21, when an audiotape of a man purported to be bin Laden said the release of two French journalists abducted by militants hinged on France's military role in Afghanistan. ""We repeat the same message to you,"" said the speaker in an audiotape played on the Al-Jazeera satellite news network. ""The release of your prisoners from the hands of our brethren depends on the withdrawal of your soldiers from our countries."" The speaker warned the French government that its alliance with the United States will prove costly. Taliban militants captured the journalists -- Herve Ghesquiere and Stephane Taponier from France 3 Television -- in December 2009 and threatened to kill them if France did not meet their demands, which included the release of some detainees held by France. It is believed the two remain in Taliban custody. Bin Laden also gave interviews and made statements and videos before the September 11, 2001, attacks.","Radical Islamic websites ring with praise of bin Laden .

"Washington (CNN) -- Fellow Democrats mounted increasing pressure Wednesday for Rep. Anthony Weiner to resign, a day after party leaders turned their backs on the liberal congressman embroiled in a ""sexting"" scandal. Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Reps. Allyson Schwartz of Pennsylvania, Michael Michaud of Maine, Mike Ross of Arkansas, Niki Tsongas of Massachusetts, Larry Kissell of North Carolina and Joe Donnelly of Indiana joined a growing chorus of Democratic voices that have called for Weiner, D-New York, to step down over sexually tinged online communications with several women that he then lied about. ""Enough is enough,"" Donnelly said in a statement. ""It's time for Congressman Weiner to resign. His actions have disgraced the Congress. Everyone should be focused on jobs and the economy and his refusal to do the right thing is a distraction."" What do you think about Rep. Weiner's confession? In addition, Donnelly and some other Democrats have announced they were donating campaign contributions from Weiner to charity. David Axelrod, the former senior advisor to President Barack Obama now heading Obama's re-election campaign, told CNN that he expected the situation to get resolved ""one way or another ... fairly quickly. ""I'm sure he's doing a lot of soul-searching,"" Axelrod said of Weiner. A Democratic legislator familiar with discussions with and about Weiner told CNN that Weiner's colleagues are telling him he should resign ""to preserve his own dignity."" The congressman, who spoke on condition of not being identified by name in order to discuss private conversations, said the public call by Schwartz was part of a stepped-up effort to force Weiner out. According to the source, the effort includes private and public calls explicitly telling him it's time to leave Congress. ""There is increased resentment by his colleagues that far from having a press conference where he was going to tell the truth and roll with the flames, the flames are just getting worse and he's dragging us through it,"" the source said. ""We really thought by now, after the press conference, we would be able to talk about the Republicans' Social Security privatization bill and instead we keep talking about Anthony Weiner. And people are getting angrier and more resentful."" A new explicit photograph now published on the Internet, allegedly of Weiner's naked genitals, is the latest example of how the issue was not going away, the Democratic legislator said, adding it was unclear if Weiner would listen. ""I think he is truly conflicted and the people around him are truly conflicted,"" the source said. ""Nobody knows what is going to work."" More public calls for Weiner's resignation are expected, the source added. Also Wednesday, multiple New York Democratic sources told CNN it is highly likely Weiner's district will be eliminated as part of next year's redistricting process. Weiner, who is married, admitted earlier this week that he engaged in sexually tinged communications with multiple women and lied about it. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, are expecting their first child. Philippe Reines, a colleague and friend of Abedin, responded ""no comment"" when asked about the pregnancy report. Weiner's admission Monday launched calls from Republicans and then an increasing number of Democrats for him to step aside. ""It would be fine with me,"" Pryor said Wednesday. ""I think at this point it would probably be a good thing if he would go ahead and resign."" Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine said Tuesday that Weiner's attempted cover-up of the scandal makes him unfit for office. ""Lying is unforgivable,"" said Kaine, now a U.S. Senate candidate in Virginia. ""Lying publicly about something like this is unforgivable and he should resign."" While other Democrats haven't explicitly called on Weiner to step down, they have done little to demonstrate any support for him. ""Representative Weiner has some problems,"" Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, told reporters Wednesday. ""I wish there was some way I could defend him, but I can't,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Tuesday. Asked what he would say if Weiner sought advice, Reid smiled and responded: ""I'd tell him to call someone else."" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, who called for an ethics investigation Monday, released a letter Tuesday detailing her formal request for the inquiry. Pelosi's letter ""certainly adds pressure for him to go,"" said a senior Democratic aide, who spoke on condition of not being identified. Weiner, who has said he would welcome an ethics probe, publicly apologized Monday for sending flirtatious messages and images on Facebook and Twitter to six women over the past three years and then denying it for a week. Over the past three days, he has been reaching out to a number of colleagues and supporters, according to one source. Among other things, Weiner called former President Bill Clinton -- who officiated at his wedding ceremony -- to personally express regret for his actions. According to a Democratic congressman who got one of the calls, Weiner was ""very contrite"" and said he ""let everyone down."" The legislator, speaking on condition of not being named because it was a private conversation, said Weiner was so choked up he could ""barely get the words out,"" and told him that he was going to ""get some help."" Wednesday's publication online of the explicit photo that a conservative blogger claims shows Weiner's genitals was the latest twist in the scandal. Andrew Breitbart, whose biggovernment.com website broke the story of Weiner's sexting, said the photo came from a woman who told him Weiner sent it to her. Weiner acknowledged Monday that such an X-rated photo of him could exist. Also Wednesday, one of the women with whom Weiner communicated online said the congressman initiated sexual exchanges. ""I would want to talk politics. But he would turn it creepy,"" Lisa Weiss, a 40-year-old blackjack dealer from Las Vegas, told CBS' ""Inside Edition."" Weiss said she believes Weiner has ""a weird fetish,"" but that ""it doesn't make him a bad politician ... or a bad congressman. It makes him a bad husband."" Asked what she'd say to Weiner's wife, Weiss said: ""I want to apologize. I should not have been flirting with her husband."" An ethics investigation would examine if Weiner violated House rules or brought the chamber into disrepute. The code of conduct for members of Congress calls for them to conduct themselves ""at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House."" However, ethics experts say legislators are rarely, if ever, disciplined for violating that rule alone. Using government technology such as telephones and computers for his sexting could be another story. Weiner said Monday he used his personal BlackBerry and home computer, but added: ""I don't have the knowledge of every last communication, but I don't believe that I used any government resources."" Even if he did, that doesn't automatically subject him to House discipline, said Stan Brand, a former House general counsel who has represented legislators before the ethics panel. Members of Congress sometimes use official resources for nongovernment activities, Brand noted, adding that ""the House has never taken a position or disciplined someone for that use."" Back in Weiner's district -- which straddles Brooklyn and Queens -- voters were divided over what the congressman should do. Some constituents said he should ""never resign,"" while others called for his immediate ouster. Weiner was first elected to Congress in 1998 and has won seven straight elections. Whether or not Weiner retains the support of most of his constituents, many analysts believe he has almost certainly lost his spot as a front-runner in New York's 2013 mayoral election. In addition, multiple New York Democratic sources told CNN on Wednesday they believe it is highly likely Weiner will ultimately lose his congressional district as part of a redistricting deal. New York will lose two of its 29 U.S. House seats by 2012 due to recent U.S. Census results. Before news broke of the Weiner scandal, most New York state government observers believed one Republican seat upstate would be lost along with one Democratic seat downstate. The fact that Weiner is now tarnished makes it extremely likely his seat will be the one that Democrats sacrifice, the sources said. Two of the sources -- both Democratic strategists in New York -- said the impending redistricting is one reason New York Democrats aren't rushing to call on Weiner to resign. Many believe it is better for them if he stays because it makes it more likely that his district will be eliminated instead of theirs, the sources noted. CNN's Alan Silverleib, Tom Cohen, Peter Hamby, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Mary Snow, Meghan Rafferty, Josh Levs and Kate Bolduan contributed to this story.","NEW: Democratic colleague says contrite Weiner called to apologize .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan has decided to enter a no contest plea this week -- the equivalent to a guilty plea -- to a misdemeanor theft charge, a source close to the actress said Monday. While a judge has already sentenced Lohan to 120 days in jail for violating her drunk driving probation with the charge, she is likely to serve no more than two weeks, according to a Los Angeles sheriff's spokesman. Probation officials, in a sentencing report that would be presented to the judge, could recommend that Lohan complete her sentence at home wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet, sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Lohan's trial for allegedly stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store was scheduled for June 3, with a pre-trial hearing to be held Wednesday. The source close to Lohan, who asked not to be named, said the actress would use this week's hearing to enter her plea. Getting the threat of jail time behind her could be important for Lohan's acting career, considering she's been cast in the ""Gotti"" movie, which is set for production in October. A new prosecutor took over the case last week, opening the door for new talks on a plea deal. When Lohan rejected a plea deal last March and decided to take the theft charge to trial, it was a felony case. Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Danette Meyers was insisting she go to jail at least for several months. But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner reduced it to a misdemeanor charge, which took it out of Meyers' jurisdiction. She handed the case off to the Los Angeles city attorney last Wednesday. Sautner allowed Lohan to remain free on bond while she appealed the 120-day probation violation sentence. The actress has already reported to the Los Angeles Downtown Women's Center where she must serve 360 hours of community service. Lohan must also work 120 hours at the county morgue, the judge ordered. If Sautner gives Lohan no additional jail time on the misdemeanor theft charge, she could be free in just two weeks, based on guidelines explained by Whitmore. The 120-day sentence is reduced to 71 days when the state formula for ""good time"" is applied off the top, Whitmore said. The remaining sentence becomes just 14 days served under the sheriff's guidelines to reduce jail overcrowding, he said. Female inmates locked up for non-violent offenses get out after serving just 20 percent of the sentence, he said. Lohan's probation officer could recommend that she serve no jail time, but instead be fitted for an electronic ankle bracelet and ordered to stay at home for a time to be determined, Whitmore said. But Sautner could have the final word, insisting on a minimum amount of jail time for Lohan, he said. Lohan was just weeks away from being free from supervised probation stemming from two drunk driving convictions in 2007 when she was charged with felony grand theft. She allegedly walked out of the Venice jewelry store with a diamond-and-gold necklace around her neck that had not been purchased. The alleged theft happened just three weeks after the actress completed three months of drug rehab. She checked into the Betty Ford Clinic only after another judge ordered her to jail for a month after finding she violated probation with a failed drug test. At that time, prosecutor Meyers asked the judge to send the actress to jail for 180 days. ""I'm not quite sure we've gotten her attention yet,"" Meyers said at an October hearing. Meyers argued that Lohan has a pattern of checking into rehab ""every time she has a violation and jail is leering over her head."" But Meyers is now out of Lohan's legal life. Other than a few hours waiting in jail for bonds to be posted, Lohan has served just 13 days behind bars. That happened in August, when the sheriff let her out early from a 90-day probation-violation sentence.","A hearing is set for Wednesday in Lohan's theft case .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari's Fernando Alonso has said the Italian team were too slow at Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix as the legendary marque continued their stuttering start to the 2011 Formula One season. The two-time world champion slipped from fifth position on the grid to a seventh place finish at the Shanghai International Circuit and the Spaniard is now 42 points behind current leader Sebastian Vettel in the drivers' championship after three races. Alonso, 29, admitted he made a bad start in the year's third grand prix but maintained race strategy was not the reason behind Ferrari's low-scoring performance. ""Unfortunately, our race pace was too slow and I don't think that a different strategy would have changed anything,"" the former McLaren driver told Ferrari's official web site. Proud Hamilton ends Vettel's winning run . ""I made a bad start, Felipe Massa [Alonso's teammate] managed to get past me and a Force India nearly did the same, then it was a good battle on the opening lap. After the first pit stop, I lost too much time behind Michael [Schumacher], thus losing touch with the leading group. ""It was a good battle, but I would have preferred to have been doing it for a podium finish rather than seventh place."" Alonso insisted Ferrari can improve and once again challenge Vettel's front-running Red Bull team, citing the McLaren and Mercedes teams as examples to follow. ""I won't get downhearted or lose confidence. We know we have to improve to get to the front. McLaren and Mercedes have managed it and there is no reason to think we can't do the same."" Latest Formula One standings after round three . Team president Luca di Montezemolo demanded an improvement from all involved with the Maranello-based outfit, and he called upon Ferrari engineers to redouble their efforts in an attempt to increase the performance of the 150 Italia car. ""This cannot and must not be the team's level,"" the 63-year-old said. ""It's a very delicate moment. I expect our engineers to act with determination and know-how, unleashing the maximum of their capacity to improve the performance of the car in a short time. ""I want Ferrari to be at the level that both we and our fans demand it should be."" The Brazilian Massa faired marginally better than his colleague with a sixth place finish, but the 29-year-old disagreed with Alonso that race strategy played no part in the result. ""The strategy? Now, it's easy to say that we were not on the right one, but we are a team and we take our decisions together. ""Vettel made the same choice as us and we had a reasonably similar pace. Probably we would have finished on the podium, but we need to look into all the details with the engineers."" British driver Lewis Hamilton took the checkered flag for McLaren on Sunday to end reigning champion Vettel's 100% start to his title defense. Ferrari's decision making hit the headlines at the end of the 2010 season when an error in race strategy cost Alonso a third world title at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Formula now takes a three week break before the season's first race in Europe, the Turkish Grand Prix, on May 8.","Fernando Alonso has said Ferrari lacked race pace at the Chinese Grand Prix .

"(CNN)  -- Barcelona reached the Champions League final after drawing 1-1 with Real Madrid in the Nou Camp Tuesday to go through 3-1 on aggregate. 2-0 to the good from the first leg at the Bernabeu, Barcelona took the lead through Pedro in the 54th minute while Marcelo scored the equalizer for Real 10 minutes later. Barcelona will play either Manchester United or Schalke at Wembley on May 28 with the English side having a 2-0 lead heading into the second leg at home Wednesday. In contrast to the ill-tempered first leg, both teams ended the match with a full set of players and there were none of the ugly confrontations that marred that encounter. Real proved obdurate opponents but rode their luck in the first half as Lionel Messi forced two fine saves from Iker Casillas before dragging a shot wide from a great position. But in the second half, Real showed more purpose and Barcelona were fortunate when Gonzalo Higuian had the ball in the net only for the referee to rule that Javier Mascherano had been fouled by Ronaldo in the build-up. A fine passing movement, which started with goalkeeper Victor Valdes, saw the returning Andres Iniesta play a pin-point pass for Pedro to score the crucial goal soon afterwards. Real responded as Angel Di Maria hit the post but retrieved the ball to play in Marcelo, who scored with a fine strike. Pressure from the visitors led to a tense finale to the match, but with victory assured Barcelona captain Carles Puyol departed to be replaced by Eric Abidal to a thunderous reception. Abidal has made a full recovery after a liver tumor and at the final whistle he was hoisted high by his teammates as they celebrated reaching the final of European football's top club competition. ""It is a unique feeling, to once again be in the final,"" Iniesta, who missed the first leg through injury, told AFP. ""Winning a confrontation like this one deserves to be feted."" Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho was banned from taking any part in the second leg after being sent off for protesting Pepe's dismissal in the first match and he watched on television at his team's hotel. He would have seen an improved performance from his side but Barcelona always had the edge on their bitter rivals over the two legs as they head for a likely repeat of the 2009 final against Manchester United, which they won.","Barcelona reach Champions League final with 3-1 aggregate win over Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- Ahh, summer -- a time of sun-drenched picnics where one partakes in three-legged races, whimsical games of croquet and copious pours of wine (the sweet nectar sucked from the recesses of paper bags so as to avoid the long arm of Johnny Law, of course). And everyone knows that those picnics will fade into foggy, watercolor memories if not obsessively documented. While a lucky few of us have a trusty photog friend who's always on hand to snap golden-hued pictures of our glorious glory days, others must rely on another, more mechanical companion for our photo-grabbing needs: one's smartphone. Thankfully, there are scads of photo-taking and sharing apps out there that are sure to get more play this summer than that chick over there in the Lolita-esque crop top. Some are, shall we say, more exhibitionist than others (like the aforementioned chick). Here's our take on four apps for everyone from rabid shutterbugs to shut-ins. For storytellers . Are you one of those people who comes into work every Monday with winding tales about driving out into the desert and communing with the cacti about fourth-dimensional time shifts as your friends dance in a daisy chain and the sun sets gorgeously in the background? Well, now you can document every leg of your spiritual journey with a new app for iPhone and iPod touch called Blurb Mobile, which allows you create stories with photo, video and audio. You can then share those multimedia tales via Facebook, Twitter and e-mail, so that your work friends can experience your transcendent weekend (or laugh at your cactus convo) right along with you. For voyeurs . Ever wonder what your neighbors are up to at those swingin' hot tub party BBQs they're always throwing? Well, put down the binoculars and download Color, a photo/video-sharing app for iPhone (and Android, soon) that allows you to see photos and videos from other users in your vicinity. There's no ""friending"" on Color -- you're just shown pictures taken by people you hang out with on a regular basis (determined via location technology). We can see the app being a standby at many a festival this summer (it was already featured at the Sweetlife Music Festival in D.C.) -- especially for those concert-goers crammed in the back behind lumbering show ogres. Still, every pic on Color is public, so if you plan on snapping some sexy shots of you and your honey behind the bandstand, uh, you might want to use a point-and-shoot. For socialites . If every Facebook notification sends a thrill shooting through your deepest core, iPhone appInstagram will likely bring you to crisis. Instagram is basically a photo-sharing social network, which allows you to follow other users and comment on and ""Favorite"" their snaps -- in which everyone is beautiful and '70sesque thanks to a cadre of flattering filters. Yeah, that sunset is rad, but wouldn't it be radder if five people affirmed its beauty by tossing you a ""Like""? Don't have an iPhone? PicPlz is pretty darn similar to Instagram. For Greta Garbo . Not everyone is big into sharing their lives with the whole block -- gossiping on front stoops as night falls, or finding out the latest neighborhood news from Debra at the diner. No, some of us would rather divulge our secrets to a particular group of friends -- you know, like your model train enthusiasts society, or your historical reenactment club. Enter Path, an iPhone photo/video app that only allows you to share snaps with up to 50 friends (within the app and on Facebook), max. The figure stems from the work of Oxford psychologist Rubin Dunbar, who says that humans can only handle maintaining relationships with up to 150 people. Because, let's face it, you probably don't have more than 50 pals who would be down to check out snaps from that recreation of the Civil War you're planning on staging down at Fort Sumter this summer.","There are scads of photo-taking and sharing apps that deserve some play this summer .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- They chanted ""Osama, Hero! ... Obama, Terrorist! ... Destroy America!"" Hundreds of followers of the Islamic Defenders Front gathered Wednesday at its Jakarta headquarters to give Osama bin Laden ""a million thanks and honor."" They sang Islamic songs before chanting prayers for bin Laden. Islamic Defenders Front, or FPI, is an Indonesian Islamist movement which advocates implementation of conservative laws. They're more known for thuggish attacks on groups deemed un-Islamic or immoral and minority religious groups, according to human rights groups. Men, women and children filed into FPI's Jakarta headquarters, walking past posters of Osama bin Laden and U.S. President Barack Obama, his face crossed out in red. In a statement read by its Secretary General Sobri Lobis, FPI expressed doubt about the death of bin Laden, saying the news from ""infidel America"" should be scrutinized. However, the group also said, if the news was true, it condemned the killing and the way bin Laden's body was buried at sea.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The Japanese company trying to contain the release of radiation from its Fukushima nuclear plant must pour enough water to cool its damaged reactors without creating an overflow of contaminated water from the plant, a government official said Tuesday. Yukio Edano, Japan's chief Cabinet secretary and the government's point man for the nation's nuclear crisis, said the effort to prevent the reactors from overheating ""must be given priority."" But Edano acknowledge the danger posed by continuing to pour water into them. ""If we need to increase water injection, this is what we need to do.  If we stop water injection, fuel rod temperatures may increase and that may result in overheating,"" Edano said.  ""But fundamentally we need to drain the water as soon as possible."" Edano's remarks came a day after he told reporters that the containment structure surrounding one of the reactors at a quake-battered nuclear power plant is damaged and may be leaking radioactive material. The plant's owner disclosed that small amounts of plutonium had been found among contaminants around the facility late Monday as Japanese authorities struggled to explain how radioactive water was leaking into maintenance tunnels and possibly, into the Pacific Ocean. Edano told reporters Monday afternoon that ""there may be a leak"" from the containment vessel surrounding the No. 2 reactor. He said experts were still trying to determine the condition of the reactor's pressure vessel, which sits inside the containment vessel and immediately surrounds the radioactive fuel rods at the reactor's core. ""Somehow, we understand water is being moved from one place to another,"" Edano said. ""We need to hear an explanation from experts."" Reactors 1 to 3 at the plant, located about 240 kilometers (140 miles) north of Tokyo, are believed to have suffered core damage after their cooling systems were knocked out by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that ravaged northern Japan. The tsunami knocked out backup generators that ran their coolant systems and damaged water pumps at the plant, forcing workers to scramble to prevent a meltdown. Technicians restored external electric power late Monday to the No. 3 reactor plant, a step toward restoring cooling systems there, the plant's owner reported late Monday. But hydrogen explosions -- an early symptom of core damage -- inflicted heavy damage on the buildings housing the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors in the days following the quake, and another suspected explosion rocked the No. 2 reactor on March 15. Japanese nuclear regulators and the owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, say they know little about what damage was sustained in that blast. Tokyo Electric announced late Monday that plutonium -- a reactor byproduct that is also part of the fuel mix in the No. 3 reactor -- had turned up in soil on the plant grounds in tests taken last week. However, the company said it was equivalent to the amounts that fell on Japan following above-ground nuclear weapons tests by other countries in past decades, and posed no health risk to humans. ""Just in case, TEPCO will increase the monitoring of the nuclear plant grounds and the surrounding environment,"" the company said. Three plutonium isotopes -- Pu-238, -239 and -240 -- were found in soil at five different points inside the plant grounds, Tokyo Electric reported. The element can be a serious health hazard if inhaled or ingested, but external exposure poses little health risk, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The company said the discovery would not change efforts to bring an end to the crisis at the plant, which has spread radioactive contamination across much of northern Japan. Water found in a maintenance tunnel leading to unit No. 2's turbine house remained radioactive enough to pose an immediate hazard, authorities reported after taking new readings Monday afternoon. The 1,000 millisievert per hour reading is more than 330 times the dose an average person in a developed country receives per year and can result in vomiting and up to a 30 percent higher risk of cancer, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The level is also four times the top dose Japan's Health Ministry has set for emergency workers struggling to control the further emission of radioactive material from the damaged plant. Cham Dallas, an expert on radiation and public health at the University of Georgia, told CNN's ""American Morning"" that the level suggests operators are facing ""a deteriorating situation"" at the No. 2 reactor. ""Fortunately, that's in the reactor area, not outside and not in Tokyo or even in the area in Fukushima province,"" Dallas said. ""But in the reactor area itself, that's -- that's concerning to me. We're starting to see levels now that are dangerous to reactor workers if they're in those contaminated areas."" The officials said it was unclear how contaminated water got into the tunnel, or if it might have spilled out and seeped into the Pacific Ocean from there. ""Right now, it is not known,"" Hidehiko Nishiyama, an official with Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said  Monday evening. Water was being pumped out of the No. 1 and No. 2 turbine building, but Nishiyama noted that there is no place to put water pooled in the No. 2 building's basement. The plan is to extract the water using what he called a condenser. But that apparatus is ""almost full,"" as are several storage tanks nearby. A similar challenge is holding up the removal of collected water in the No. 3 unit's turbine building basement. ""So we will first have to empty some of the tanks,"" he said, adding later only that the tainted water needs to be removed ""as soon as possible."" Seawater readings from a monitoring post 330 meters (361 yards) into the Pacific Ocean showed elevated readings of the reactor byproduct iodine-131, an isotope that loses half its radioactivity every eight days. The measurement was taken north of the discharge canal for reactors 1-4, where a reading of 1,850 times normal was recorded Sunday. And despite reduced alarms in recent days, Nishiyama noted Monday that the temperature is rising inside the No. 1 reactor -- a sign that the nuclear fuel rods in that unit remain in danger of overheating. Units 1, 2 and 3 were the only three of the six reactors operating when the magnitude 9 earthquake struck. The quake and resulting tsunami knocked out backup generators that ran their coolant systems and damaged water pumps at the plant, leaving authorities scrambling to pump water into the reactors and the spent fuel pools to prevent a meltdown. Authorities have switched from pumping seawater into the reactors to using fresh water, and plan to switch from seawater to fresh water in the spent fuel pools, where old fuel rods are stored. Monday was the 32nd anniversary of the worst U.S. nuclear accident, a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island power plant outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Though no deaths or injuries resulted, the accident hamstrung the American atomic power industry for decades.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Forget the Royal Navy and the U.S. Marines -- the 'computer navy' is on its way, and digital media on the high seas are set to make a steaming comeback. New home? Barges like this one could soon play host to Google's massive data centers. It seemed that floating media firms were a thing of the past when the United Kingdom's last major offshore pirate radio station, Radio Caroline, followed other European and American examples and died out in the early 1990s. But, fast-forward 20 years and enter Internet giant Google. According to a patent application seen by London newspaper ""The Times,"" Google is considering launching barges up to seven miles (11km) offshore to host the massive data centers required to run its Internet search engines. The plan would likely see the data centers -- which consist of huge supercomputers -- use wave energy to power and cool themselves while stationed at sea. In the application Google states: ""Computing centers are located on a ship or ships, anchored in a water body from which energy from natural motion of the water may be captured, and turned into electricity and/or pumping power for cooling pumps to carry heat away."" Energy consumption is undoubtedly a massive issue for these giant data centers. The servers within each data center need to be air-conditioned to prevent overheating -- and considering a company such as IBM runs approximately eight million square feet of servers -- that's a lot of required cooling. According to a 2005 study by Stanford University consulting professor and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs staff scientist, Jonathan Koomey, the energy consumption of data centers doubled in the period from 2000 to 2005. The total annual worldwide power bill for the servers at the time was an estimated $7.2 billion, according to Koomey. The Internet has continued to grow at a rapid rate and other major companies have also been searching for a more efficient method of maintaining their data centers. Microsoft has looked into taking advantage of a cold climate by constructing a data center in Siberia, while Sun Microsystems is reported to be sending its computers down a former coal mine, using water below the ground as a coolant. But, how workable is Google's project, really? And does it mark a potential new future for the maritime industry? Dr Brad Karp, reader in Computer Systems and Networks at University College London, described the move as ""an audacious risk"" that will push the boundaries for major companies in future. Karp said the project would carry significant risks, but potentially very high rewards. ""Anytime you take on several new technologies at the one time -- and you are trying to build something highly reliable -- there are going to be real technical challenges, which there will be for these data centers,"" he said. Some major benefits of Google's project include being able to save money on rent and property taxes by being positioned offshore, as well as saving money on electricity bills. ""If you look at the percentage of power being used by these centers ... it seems like a good long-term bet for the future,"" Karp told CNN. Karp believes Google could also benefit from snaring a ""green"" image if it is able to harness wave motion to power the computers and their cooling systems, in addition to providing a quality service to users. ""One of the reasons Google has data centers around the world is to enhance the user experiences near where many of their users are. This will still allow them to do that."" He said there were some logistical issues, but if the ships were stationed not far from the coast, they should not have too many operational concerns. ""At that distance (11km) you would want to provide wired network activity -- some sort of under-sea cable. The sheer bit-rate needed for an operation like this is usually too high for most wireless systems,"" Karp said. Karp does point out there could be plenty of maintenance required on such a system: ""The sea is not exactly a friendly environment for cables."" Although some commentators have raised concerns about the ships leaving themselves open to attack, Karp did not feel it was a major issue. ""It's not the kind of thing you see reported on very often. Typically the kind of things we worry about more is network-based attacks."" Current data centers are defended by corporate-type security consisting of reception desks and electronically guarded entrances.  Karp envisages a similar level of protection for the centers at sea, potentially using a protective barrier or guarding vessels. If this project is realized, it offers the potential to alter not only online commerce, but also introduces the potential for new strands of business in the maritime industry. Maritime eCommerce Association spokesman Ake Nilson said: ""So far as I know there isn't anything quite like it. We haven't really seen anything like this since the old pirate radio stations."" Nilson says that if the project goes ahead -- and more companies attempt to adopt a similar program -- it could provide a sizable boost to the maritime industry through the ships and workers required to establish, run, protect and maintain such operations.","Google has sent a patent application to launch barges to host its data centers .
Wave energy could be used to power and cool the data centers' servers .
The project would save Google money on power bills, rent, and property tax .
Such projects have the potential to boost to the maritime industry ."
"(CNN) -- If you've ever turned on VH1 (or at least passed by it while channel surfing to something with sharks), there's a 200% chance that you've seen the network's ""I Love The ...

(""I Love the 70's"" and ""I Love the New Millennium,"" respectively.) As a regular contributor to the series, it seems as though Hal pretty much loved every decade, and everyone seemed to love Hal. In fact, in 1999 the budding comedian received his big break on TV when the E! network pegged him to host ""Talk Soup,"" a show that aired the best clips from the previous day's daily talk shows (read: people getting naked on ""Springer""). Sparks says, ""I learned a lot more about the audience -- the Romanesque problem we have as a culture right now. 'Jerry Springer' is just kind of the chubby, redneck version of throwing Christians to the lions."" Shortly after taking over ""Talk Soup,"" Sparks landed a role on the Showtime series ""Queer as Folk"" and numerous other parts on various networks. Basically, the guy started to show up just about everywhere, including big-screen appearances in ""Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star,"" ""Spider-Man 2"" and as the cult leader Zoltan in ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" (Zoltan: ""Soon we will leave this lame planet and fly through outer space with cool aliens who like us!"") But if you haven't seen him on TV or in film, there's also a chance you've seen him on stage, singing and playing guitar for the band Zero 1. Or, perhaps, he beat you up in a kung fu fight.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A Japanese nuclear plant will shut down its reactors after the country's prime minister warned it was vulnerable to natural disasters, its owner announced Monday. The Chubu Electric Company said it will take two of its reactors at the Hamaoka nuclear plant off line and not bring a third back on line, effectively shutting down the plant. In a statement, the company said, ""At the May 9, 2011 meeting of the Board of Directors, Chubu Electric Power Company, Inc., has decided to suspend operations of Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant until further measures to prevent tsunami (damage) are completed, as requested by the prime minister."" Prime Minister Naoto Kan said last week that the plant -- located on the Pacific coast in Omaezaki, southwest of Tokyo -- could produce ""grave damage to Japan"" similar to the problems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, and wanted earthquake and tsunami protections put in place. Akihisa Mizuno, president of Chubu Electric, said safety was the company's first priority. Meanwhile, workers reentered the No. 1 reactor building at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant Monday as they try to restore its cooling system, the plant's operator said. Nine Toyko Electric Power Co. employees and two representatives from Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency spent about 30 minutes in the building measuring radiation levels. On Thursday, workers went into the damaged facility for the first time since a magnitude-9.0 earthquake and ensuing tsunami in March. They installed a ventilation system that is filtering radioactive substances from the air. The purpose of Monday's visit was to see how successful the system has been. Once the radioactive contamination in the air is lowered enough, workers will be able stay in the building longer to install a cooling system that Tokyo Electric wants to use to perform a cold shut down of the reactor. Cooling systems at Fukushima Daiichi, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, were knocked out by the devastating tsunami that struck Japan's Pacific coast after a massive earthquake March 11. The disaster triggered the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl as the cores of reactors 1-3 overheated and spewed huge amounts of radioactive contamination across the surrounding area. The buildings that house reactors 1 and 3 were blown apart by hydrogen explosions in the first days of the crisis. Another hydrogen buildup is believed to have ruptured a water reservoir beneath the No. 2 reactor. In April, Tokyo Electric laid out a six- to nine-month timetable for winding down the crisis and bringing the reactors to a complete shutdown. The disaster has led to mandatory evacuations of about 78,000 people living within 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of the plant. People living another 10 kilometers away -- or at least another 60,000 people -- have been ordered to remain sheltered.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- The wife of the South African state security minister was sentenced Friday to 12 years in prison for drug dealing that included hiring smugglers, authorities said. Cheryl Cwele was convicted after one of the women testified against her. Charmaine Moss, who testified against her, said Cwele asked them to pick up a parcel in Turkey, but she turned her down. Prosecutors relied on the woman's testimony, text messages and e-mails to prove their case, said Natasha Ramkisson, a spokeswoman for the national prosecuting authority. Moss told the court that Cwele offered them more than $3,500. Another woman agreed to pick up the package, and was arrested in Brazil, where she is now serving an eight-year sentence for drug trafficking, Ramkisson said. Cwele was convicted Thursday together with a Nigerian accomplice. She had pleaded not guilty. Opposition parties called on minister Siyabonga Cwele to resign following his wife's sentencing. The minister is a member of the ruling African National Congress.

"(CNN) -- Rapper Flo Rida is out of jail after being arrested Thursday on suspicion of drunken driving. He posted bail of $2,000 and obtained a signed court order allowing him to travel to Asia for a series of previously scheduled concerts in Bangkok over the weekend, his lawyer said. Miami Beach police said officers spotted the South Florida artist, whose real name is Tramar Dillard, driving his 2008 Bugatti erratically in the early morning hours. According to the arrest report, Dillard swerved in and out of lanes about five times and drove for another two blocks after the responding officer activated his emergency lights and air horn. Police said the rapper smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot, watery eyes and slurred speech, the report said. Officers administered a field sobriety test, during which Dillard said, ""Officer, I can't do this,"" and ""I don't feel like I can walk a straight line."" Dillard said, ""I had a few drinks,"" according to the report. Police said he blew a 0.185 on a Breathalyzer exam, more than twice the legal limit. Dillard was charged with driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license for previously failing to pay a traffic fine. ""Until we have an opportunity to meet with our client and conduct our own investigation into the facts, we are declining further comment on this matter,"" said a statement from his attorneys, Christopher Lyons and Sandy Becher.

"Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- Facebook is already adept at handling public-relations blunders, but the company is beginning to focus on how it can help with real calamities. About a dozen disaster-relief workers from governments and nonprofit organizations convened this week for a five-hour meeting at Facebook's offices here in Palo Alto, California, and via teleconference from Washington. While the groups, which included members from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and California Emergency Management Agency, were grateful for the gesture, they were not above taking good-humored jabs at Facebook for its rocky relations with government. ""Thank you so much for inviting us here,"" Kelly Huston, a Cal EMA spokesman, said near the end of the assembly. ""I know your interaction with government isn't great because we're suing you all the time for privacy issues."" Meanwhile, another Facebook privacy debate was stewing during the meeting when Facebook began widening the reach of its facial-recognition feature. European Union regulators will hold an inquiry about the matter, Bloomberg reports. The Tuesday event was Facebook's first noteworthy collaboration with emergency-response organizations, spokespeople said. Site administrators currently manage a page called Global Disaster Relief on Facebook. It has about 540,000 members, or less than 1% of Facebook's total user base -- but still more than the combined Facebook fans for all the groups that attended the meeting. FEMA and the American Red Cross representatives offered occasional insights from Washington. FEMA Administrator William Craig Fugate, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009, met with Facebook in October but was not present at this week's meeting. ""Discussions like these help us learn from each other about what is working well and what isn't,"" Shayne Adamski, a FEMA senior manager who attended the meeting, wrote in an e-mailed statement. For some, the affair was an education seminar, a chance to ask questions to the masters of the platform. Wendy Harman, the social media director for the Red Cross, expressed frustrations with managing Facebook pages. ""It makes me want to cry thinking about making 80,000 instances and updating them into eternity,"" she said. Facebook spokespeople were quick to offer suggestions. ""We can play a really important role in educating,"" said Dave Steer, who manages Facebook's trust and safety team. ""This is one of the reasons we convened this kind of forum."" The Red Cross extended an open invitation to Facebook to embed with its disaster-relief team, Harman said. Google, which has more than 20 times as many employees as Facebook, devoted a ""small team"" last year to building projects that help provide disaster-related news or organize search efforts for missing people. Tumblr, the blogging platform, has added buttons to its site that encourage bloggers to donate to disaster relief efforts. Facebook was less apt to promise dedicated resources from its 2,000 employees. Steer suggested Facebook could create an internal think tank focused on disaster response. ""How do we leverage some of the minds of the people who work here to tackle the technical problems?"" he asked. Company spokesman Frederic Wolens added: ""Facebook is the platform."" Some weren't fully convinced of Facebook's dedication to the cause. ""I know that Facebook is a platform, and you want to push that, but going beyond marketing Facebook,"" said Heather Blanchard, co-founder of the nonprofit Crisis Commons, ""part of it is about recording history."" ""You have an entire research population hungry for what you know,"" she added. Facebook plans to discuss the feedback it received from the organizations over the next few weeks and will determine how best to handle the requests. Tuesday's agenda included a brainstorming session for a Facebook application dedicated to disaster relief, but the concept wasn't discussed at length. Facebook liaisons offered technical guidance and recorded talking points and ideas on whiteboards: one bolted to the wall and the other projected digitally. In the past, Facebook has held similar summits with organizations addressing bullying, suicide and privacy issues. Social media tools have quickly become a mainstay for disaster response in many countries. Twitter saw the third-highest activity on its service after the Japan earthquake in March, a spokesman said. Justin Osofsky, Facebook's director of partnerships, highlighted ""stuff that happens organically"" in response to disasters, such as the page for finding items lost during the Joplin, Missouri, tornado. By highlighting these grassroots programs in addition to promoting those from government and nonprofits, Facebook thinks it can help. ""There's a thirst for information,"" Steer said. ""Now the onus is on us to quench that thirst.""","Facebook organized a meeting of government and nonprofit groups to talk disasters .
Facebook is considering offering more data or creating an internal think tank .

"(CNN) -- Spanish club Villarreal will wait until the end of this season to appoint a permanent new manager after deciding to give reserve coach Juan Carlos Garrido the reins on a short-term basis. The 40-year-old takes over from Ernesto Valverde, who was relieved of his duties following Sunday night's 2-0 home defeat by Osasuna. Garrido has been appointed despite ""The Yellow Submarine"" being linked with former Getafe coach Michael Laudrup, with the team 10th in La Liga after last year's impressive fifth placing and having been knocked out of the Copa Del Rey by second division Celta Vigo. Valverde, who moved to El Madrigal after Manuel Pellegrini joined Real Madrid in June, bid a sad farewell to his players on Monday. ""I've come to say goodbye to the team. It's a different and hard situation for me. The club decided that we wouldn't continue at the helm of Villarreal,"" he told reporters. ""I came with a lot of excitement because it was the team I wanted to train and it is true that things, from the beginning, did not happen as we all hoped. ""It's certain that we haven't played very well in the past two or three games and that the elimination from the Copa did us a lot of damage and also yesterday the team were bad, and I can only say that the only person responsible is me. ""I am the visible head of the team, the club made a decision and I have to accept it."" Meanwhile, struggling Real Valladolid sacked coach Jose Luis Mendilibar on Monday, making him the seventh managerial casualty of the Spanish top-flight season. The 48-year-old had kept the club in La Liga for two seasons after a record-breaking promotion-winning campaign, but Sunday night's 1-1 draw with lowly Almeria left his team just one point above the relegation zone. Reserve-team coach Onesimo Sanchez takes over a team who have won just three times in the last 31 league outings, with the announcement made as Valladolid unveiled new loan signing Asier del Horno. The 29-year-old former Athletic Bilbao and Chelsea defender, a 10-time Spain international, could make his debut against his parent club Valencia on Saturday.","Villarreal appoint reserve coach Juan Carlos Garrido as manager until end of season .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Two U.S. service members were killed Monday during operations in southern Iraq, the U.S. military said Tuesday. There were no further details about the incident, and their names are being withheld pending notification of next of kin. Violence has dropped dramatically in recent years in Iraq. Under a U.S.-Iraqi security pact, which set a timetable to withdraw American forces, U.S. troops must be out of Iraq by Jan. 1, 2012. However, U.S. troops have increasingly been targeted by roadside bombings and mortar attacks, largely in Baghdad and southern Iraq -- a Shiite stronghold. Five American soldiers were killed June 6, the single largest loss of life among U.S. troops since 2009, and the military says that attack is likely the work Shiite militia trying to take credit for driving forces out of the country.","The incident occurred in southern Iraq .

"(CNN) -- A new report from accountancy firm Deloitte has revealed that English Premier League wages are continuing to rise at a quicker rate than club revenues. In publishing their 20th Annual Review of Football Finance, Deloitte also revealed that revenues broke the two billion euro barrier ($2.9 billion) in season 2009/2010, although this was offset by the fact that wages now take up 68 per cent of that revenue. The exact figures confirmed that the Premier League continues to be the world's richest domestic league, with the 20 clubs earning 2.03 billion euros ($2.94 billion), a figure which is expected to rise to 2.2 billion euros ($3.19 billion) for the season just gone on the back of a new television deal. This shows an increase of 49 million euros ($71m) on the previous year, although that improvement is tempered by a 64 million euros ($93m) rise in wages, taking total payroll costs to 1.4 billion euros ($2 billion). ""Cost control remains the biggest challenge facing clubs, at all levels of the professional football pyramid,"" Paul Rawnsley, Director in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, told AFP. Rawnsley added: ""Premier League clubs should still be well placed to comply with UEFA's new financial fair play regulations, as the Premier League remains the top revenue generating league in Europe. ""Clubs have time to make adjustments to their business plans before the new regulations are effective, as well as increased broadcast revenue from 2010/11 to help deliver a better balance between spending on players and revenue generation."" The Premier League's revenue far exceeds the other leading European leagues of  Germany ($2 billion), Spain and Italy ($1.89 billion) and France ($1.3 billion). The report also confirmed that Chelsea have the largest individual wage bill, with total spending of $252 million, followed by Manchester City ($193 million) and Manchester United, who spent $191 million on players' wages in the 2009-2010 season.","Premier League wages are continuing to rise faster than club revenues .

"New York (CNN) -- A 10-year-old boy escaped out of the window of a sinking minivan after his mother drove the vehicle with her three other children into the Hudson River, some 60 miles north of New York City, authorities said. Lashaun Armstrong swam to shore Tuesday night and was picked up by a passer-by and brought to a nearby fire station in Newburgh, New York, said Fire Chief Michael Vatter. Soaking wet and suffering from a mild case of hypothermia, Armstrong then told fire officials his mother had driven the vehicle into the river. Police divers later discovered the bodies of Lashanda Armstrong, 25, an 11-month-old girl, a 2-year-old boy and a 5-year-old boy some 25 yards off shore. A police investigation into the incident suggests that the mother intentionally drove the vehicle into the water, according to Newburgh Police Chief Michael Ferrara. Responders, using dive teams and a circling helicopter, found the van after an hourlong search submerged in eight feet of murky water, according to Vatter. Before the incident, a relative called police reporting a ""domestic disturbance"" that police say may have involved Armstrong's husband, Jean Pierre. That belief is based on a phone call the relative received in which they said they heard ""tussling in the background,"" noting a history of domestic problems, police said in a statement Wednesday. Police declined to identify the relative. An autopsy on the four bodies is scheduled for Wednesday. Newburgh Mayor Nicholas Valentine said the incident is certain to have ""a lasting effect on this city."" City resident and neighbor Christine Santos said she ""would never have imagined (Lashanda) to do this to her kids."" ""To them little babies. I would have never have imagined. I'm in shock,"" she added. Other neighbors described her surviving son, Lashaun, as responsible. ""He was the type of kid that was responsible for his little ones,"" said resident Carmen Davila. But the traumatic effects of Tuesday's incident could have long-term effects on the boy, analysts say. ""He has this major traumatic event and loss and that can be manifested in many ways,"" said Dr. Louis Baptista, director of Columbia University's Clinical Services for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. He warned of ""aggressive behavior, through violence, through depression, through depressive symptoms and that can be quite severe and quite impairing in a child his age.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- China Tuesday blamed its neighbors for escalating tensions in the South China Sea, one day after the Vietnamese navy held a live-fire drill in disputed waters. ""Some countries took unilateral actions to impair China's sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, released groundless and irresponsible remarks with the attempt to expand and complicate the disputes,"" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei at a regular press briefing. Beijing and Hanoi have exchanged increasingly heated words in recent weeks, accusing each other of territorial intrusions in the South China Sea, which is claimed in whole or in part by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The vast area of waters, dotted with partially submerged atolls and reefs, contain some of the world's busiest shipping lanes and are thought to hold large deposits of oil and natural gas. Hanoi authorities have announced a few recent incidents, charging that Chinese ships last week intentionally severed electric cables on Vietnamese survey vessels in Vietnamese waters. Beijing has countered that Vietnamese vessels have been illegally surveying in Chinese waters and harassing Chinese fishing boats. Computer hackers from both sides have also attacked websites in the other country, posting nationalistic images and messages, according to Chinese media reports. Although tensions flare up periodically among the various claimants of the disputed waters, the current situation is drawing more international attention amid China's fast-growing political and military power. The United States officially stays neutral in the disputes, despite some Congressional calls for a more forceful stance to balance China's clout. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however, has expressed Washington's willingness to facilitate multilateral talks on the issue. ""The United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia's maritime commons and respect for international law in the South China Sea,"" she said last July at a regional security meeting in Hanoi. Chinese analysts see the United States using the South China Sea issue as a new way to contain China's rise. ""The United States used to have Taiwan as its main bargaining chip in the region,"" said Zhang Xizhen, a professor of Southeast Asian studies at Peking University. ""Now that tensions across the Taiwan Strait have calmed down, they are turning to the South China Sea."" ""Although the U.S. claimed neutrality on the issue, if conflicts arise in the area, they may use it as an excuse to intervene,"" he added. The Beijing leadership balks at any notion of ""internationalizing"" the dispute, in sharp contrast to a recent comment by Vietnamese officials welcoming foreign involvement. ""China always maintains that countries directly related to the issue should conduct bilateral negotiations and friendly consultations,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong said. ""China is trying to safeguard its own legitimate rights and interests, not infringing on other countries' rights,"" he added. ""Justice lies in the heart of the people.""","China and Vietnam are at odds over the South China Sea .

"Abbottabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- News outlets in Pakistan have made public the name of an American they identified as the CIA station chief, but a senior Pakistani intelligence official said Monday the person named is not the station chief. Referring to a name cited in the Pakistani newspaper The Nation, the intelligence official said, ""If we were going to release the name, we would release the right one."" The official said he did not know where the name came from. A U.S. official said there is ""no current plan to bring home the current chief of station"" in Pakistan. The remarks came amid reports suggesting Pakistani officials may have leaked the name of a CIA official in the country. Tensions between the United States and Pakistan have been growing since U.S. forces found and killed Osama bin Laden in the city of Abbottabad a week ago. U.S. officials have been publicly questioning whether Pakistan did all it could to track down the world's most wanted terrorist.","Pakistani news outlets name someone they identify as the CIA station chief .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Despite being urged not to hoard bottled water, residents of Japan's capital on Wednesday snapped it up in droves after testing showed radioactive material in tap water at levels unsafe for infants. The city's water agency said the spike was likely caused by problems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, located 240 kilometers (150 miles) away. Earlier Wednesday, Tokyo government officials advised residents not to give tap water to infants or use it in formula after tests at a purification plant detected high levels of radioactive iodine. Grocery store owner Seiji Sasaki said he noted a sudden increase of customers. He had 40 cases of water in his store, but they were gone quickly. Meanwhile, officials evacuated some workers at the Fukushima plant Wednesday afternoon as a black plume of smoke billowed above one of the reactors, plant owner Tokyo Electric Power Co. said. The cause of the smoke was unclear. The team of seven workers were planning to inspect gauges and instrumentation at reactor No. 3, but were unable to determine conditions in the control room before evacuating, officials with Tokyo Electric and Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said. Workers have been scrambling to cool down fuel rods at the nuclear plant since a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and massive tsunami on March 11 knocked out cooling systems. Some radiation has been released, officials said, but it was unclear whether radiation levels spiked after the black smoke was spotted Wednesday. Japan's nuclear agency said radiation levels near the plant had not changed, public broadcaster NHK reported. But in Tokyo, concerns over radiation surged. Government samples taken Tuesday night found 210 becquerels of radioactive iodine per kilogram of water -- two times higher than the limit that the government considers safe for infants. The amount of iodine detected was lower than the level considered safe for adults: 300 becquerels per kilogram. A liter of water weights 1 kilogram. A becquerel is a measurement of radioactive intensity by weight. The level set for infants is ""very conservative,"" said Dr. James Cox, radiation oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and a CNN consultant, but elevated radiation levels are considered a problem for small children, as their thyroid glands are more susceptible to radiation. ""Erring on the side of caution for the extreme degree for children makes good sense,"" Cox said. For adults, ""as far as the immediate health risk, something that would make people sick, I don't think that would come close to it."" In response, Tokyo's government will distribute 3,500-milliliter (1-gallon) bottles of mineral water to 80,000 households in the city with infants, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Thursday. The government has said that, due to the high radiation levels, tap water should not be given to children 1 year old and younger. Authorities have advised day care centers and other such facilities not to use tap water for drinks or to prepare baby food. More bottled water is expected to be distributed to families in the future, according to NHK. Also Wednesday, Japan's government expanded food shipment restrictions after the health ministry said tests detected radioactive materials at levels exceeding legal limits in 11 types of vegetables grown near the Fukushima plant. Prime Minister Naoto Kan asked Ibaraki Prefecture to suspend shipments of raw milk and parsley, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Wednesday. The government of Fukushima Prefecture also told residents not to eat leafy vegetables, he said. Edano said radiation levels in the food would not cause health problems right away, but if radiation rises, ""We are looking at the possibility of levels reaching levels that may harm human health."" The decision to prohibit produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast Japan hit by the earthquake and tsunami. Fukushima ranks among Japan's top producer of fruits, vegetables and rice. Ibaraki, south of Fukushima, supplies Tokyo with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables and is Japan's third-largest pork producer. ""This is our livelihood,"" a Fukushima farmer told Japanese television network TV Asahi. ""It's a huge problem that we are unable to ship all our produce. We raised (this produce) with our own hands. It's unbearable that we would have to throw it all away."" Hong Kong on Wednesday said it was restricting food and milk imports from certain prefectures over the radiation concerns. The United States previously announced import alerts covering milk, milk products, fresh vegetables and fruit from prefectures near the reactors. Police say the dual disaster has killed at least 9,487 people and left at least 15,617 missing, many of them killed as a wall of water rushed in following the quake. Meanwhile, about 387,000 evacuees are staying at 2,200 shelters, Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported. Relief efforts to help them and other victims continued, with U.S. military helicopters delivering food, clothes and supplies to some of the hardest-hit areas. ""We remain focused on fewer than 10 cases of U.S. citizens that remain unaccounted for in the areas hardest hit by the earthquake and tsunami,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Wednesday. In addition to the stories of people struggling to survive in quake-ravaged towns in northeastern Japan, the plight of workers braving high radiation levels to solve problems at the troubled plant has also drawn attention. Tokyo Electric said Wednesday that two workers were injured at the plant while working with an electric panel. The workers, whose injuries did not involve exposure to radiation, were treated by a doctor at the nearby Fukushima Daini plant. ""We are constantly switching over all the time, since the work cannot be stopped,"" one worker told TV Asahi. ""It has settled down quite a lot compared to the beginning, and we could even begin to see a bright hope that maybe it would somehow work out in a little bit,"" another worker said in what the network touted as the first televised interviews with workers. But authorities said Wednesday that work was far from over at the plant. Members of Tokyo's fire department planned to start spraying water into the spent-fuel storage pool outside the plant's No. 3 reactor Wednesday, according to Hidehiko Nishiyama of Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. Power has been restored in the control room at that reactor -- which officials say could be a key step in bringing cooling systems back online. ""Until we get power restored to the power plant, continuing doing what they have been doing for the last 12 days is, quite honestly, the only game in town,"" said Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at three U.S. nuclear power plants who has been following the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. ""It's absolutely essential that they keep the reactor covered with water as well as continuing to refill it,"" he said. ""But getting the power restored and getting the equipment moving so they can get back on track is essential. At that point, we can determine the emergency is in the final stages."" He predicted power would be restored gradually to the plant over the next few days. ""The power source is going to the main control room because that is the main nerve center of the entire plant,"" he said. ""Once they get that restored, then we have some instrumentation and we can figure out what's going on in the power plant that up to this point has been almost impossible to figure out."" Once that is done, he said power will be sent to individual pieces of equipment and the situation will be analyzed. He estimated it could take two weeks or more to get the plant ""in a stable, cold shut-down configuration."" ""It is an industrial catastrophe,"" said Lake Barrett, a nuclear engineer who directed the initial cleanup and response of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania following a partial core nuclear meltdown in 1979. ""It's a huge plant, and it's been basically destroyed internally and has high contamination levels inside. There are areas in the building where no human's going to go for a long time."" But, Barrett told CNN, ""it's also not a health catastrophe -- as long as the people follow the instructions from the government, they're going to be safe in Japan."" The No. 3 reactor has been a priority for authorities trying to contain damage to the plant and stave off a possible meltdown. Its fuel rods contain plutonium mixed with uranium, which experts say could cause more harm than regular uranium fuels in the event of a meltdown. ""We have progress in stabilizing cooling capacity. We most progressed in the No. 3 reactor,"" Edano said. ""On the other hand, we are trying to figure out ... the cause of the smoke."" With the nuclear plant's six reactors in various states of disrepair, concerns have mounted over a potentially larger release of radioactive material from the facility. Efforts over the past several days have focused on restoring power at the facility while fire trucks and cement pumps sprayed water on spent fuel ponds, which contain used fuel rods with radioactive material. Embassies from more than two dozen countries have either closed down or moved operations to cities south of Tokyo since the earthquake and the resulting nuclear crisis, the country's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. ""There are 25 embassies which either temporarily shut down or moved its function outside of Tokyo,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hidenori Sobashima told CNN. Seven of those 25 have moved to cities such as Osaka, Hiroshima and Kobe, Sobashima said.

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and three other former heads of state arrived in North Korea Tuesday, as part of the latest diplomatic effort to restart talks between the North and South, state media reported. Carter is traveling with former presidents Martti Ahtisaari of Finland and Mary Robinson of Ireland, and former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Brundtland. The group is collectively known as ""The Elders"" -- an independent group of global leaders founded by former South African President Nelson Mandela. ""At a time when official dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea appears to be at a standstill, we aim to see how we may be of assistance in reducing tensions and help the parties address key issues including denuclearization,"" Carter said Monday from Beijing, where he met with Chinese officials. The Elders expect to meet with ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, along with other senior officials and diplomats. They are going to Pyongyang at the invitation of the North Korean government, Carter said . ""Clearly there is a great level of mistrust and suspicion between North and South Korea,"" Ahtisaari said. ""But the stakes are too high to allow this stand-off to continue."" The Elders are scheduled to spend three days in Pyongyang, before flying to Seoul Thursday where they will meet with South Korean officials. Tensions between North Korea and the West have spiked in recent years due in part to concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear development program. The United States and South Korea held joint military drills in February, despite North Korea's warning to the South not to carry out the drills, calling them a provocation. South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors. In November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. Carter has a long history of dealing with North Korea. His 1994 talks with the late Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il's father, paved the way for the ""Agreed Framework"" the same year -- an agreement designed to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years, increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington. In August, Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen who had been fined roughly $600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea. Gomes, who attempted to commit suicide while in North Korean custody, was believed to be a Christian activist. Earlier this month, North Korea reported through state-run news agency KCNA that it had arrested U.S. citizen Jun Young Su last year for ""committing a crime"" against the reclusive nation. KCNA did not provide details on the nature of the alleged crime. Two State Department officials, speaking on condition of not being identified, previously told CNN that the man is a Korean-American businessman. One of the sources said the businessman had a visa to enter North Korea. It was not known how Carter's visit might affect his detention. Two American journalists -- Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who had entered North Korea in March 2009 and were arrested and sentenced to 12 years hard labor -- were released in August 2009 after an intervention by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.","Tensions between North Korea and the West have spiked in recent years .

"(CNN) -- Forces loyal to self-declared Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo on Saturday attacked the hotel where Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized president of the country, is staying, a spokesman for the United Nations said. U.N. forces in Abidjan fired back, said Hamadoun Toure, spokesman for the U.N. mission in the Ivory Coast. ""We stand ready to protect the Golf Hotel, as we have a mandate,"" he told CNN. Toure added that Gbagbo loyalists continue to control three main areas -- the presidential palace, Gbagbo's residence and the state television station, RTI. He said the French military and U.N. forces are in charge of the Abidjan port. Elsewhere on Saturday, French forces aborted a mission to evacuate diplomatic staff after drawing fire from forces loyal to Gbagbo, believed to have been all but defeated earlier in the week. The evacuation was deemed too risky for those involved, said French Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Thierry Burkhard, who declined to comment on the nationality or location of the diplomats. The French ambassador's residence came under fire Friday, according to Frederic Daguillon, commander of French forces in Ivory Coast. He reported rocket-propelled grenades and two mortar shells landing on the residence. He said the fire came from positions held by Gbagbo's men, who appeared to be regaining ground. ""French helicopters opened fire in self-defense, they returned fire in self-defense and destroyed an armored vehicle,"" Daguillon said. Meanwhile, efforts were under way to restore some semblance of normalcy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's largest city. Commercial flights resumed at the Abidjan airport Saturday and the port was reopened, Burkhard said. Crews were concentrating on restoring water and electricity to residents who have gone without for days after forces loyal to Ouattara entered the city last week. Violence erupted after Ivory Coast's disputed presidential election in November and escalated into all-out war when Ouattara's forces launched an offensive that brought them into Abidjan. Ouattara is the internationally recognized president of Ivory Coast. His rival, Gbagbo, has refused to cede power, the political stalemate plunging the West African nation into crisis. Gbagbo's forces used a lull in fighting this week as a ""trick"" to reinforce their positions around the Abidjan, according to Alain Le Roy, the head of United Nations peacekeeping operations. They said Tuesday they wanted a peaceful solution to the monthslong fighting but soon resumed shelling both the U.N. headquarters and the civilian population, Le Roy told reporters at the United Nations. Since then, they have regained control of two central areas of Abidjan and fighting is continuing, Le Roy said Friday, after briefing the U.N. Security Council on developments in the cocoa-producing nation. ""They have clearly used the lull of Tuesday as a trick to reinforce their position,"" he said. Mark Toner, acting deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department, released a statement Saturday echoing that idea. ""It is clear that Gbagbo's attempts at negotiation this week were nothing more than a ruse to regroup and rearm. Gbagbo's continued attempt to force a result that he could not obtain at the ballot box reveals his callous disregard for the welfare of the Ivoirian people, who will again suffer amid renewed heavy fighting in Abidjan,"" he said. Most areas of the capital, however, are now under U.N. or French military control, journalist Seyi Rhodes reported from the French military base in Port Bouet. The French military has been working to reconnect the disrupted water and electricity supply in what is the country's main city. On Saturday, Rhodes -- who was on patrol with the French military -- said he visited Cocody, an upscale suburb of Abidjan, where Gbagbo lives. Major evacuations were conducted there, he said, describing residents running with multiple pieces of Louis Vuitton luggage in tow. Rhodes traveled with the French military through Abidjan on Friday and reported seeing civilians in the streets, including one woman selling food, which he took as a positive sign. Pro-Gbagbo forces have heavy weapons including tanks, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades and are using them ""as we speak, against the civilian population"" and U.N. headquarters, Le Roy said. ""Those who are saying there are no more heavy weapons -- that Mr. Gbagbo has no more heavy weapons -- it's a lie,"" he said. An Abidjan resident told CNN that people were now out and about on the streets but there were no public buses or taxis running. The resident said people were walking to markets and were able to buy food -- mainly rice. CNN's Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","Forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo attack the Golf Hotel, a U.N. official says .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich secured qualification for next season's Champions League on Saturday with a thumping 8-1 away win at St Pauli. The emphatic result ensures Bayern will finish in at least third place while consigning their hosts to relegation out of the Bundesliga. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen could only draw 1-1 at Hamburg meaning Bayern could still claim second when the season finishes next weekend. Striker Mario Gomez opened the scoring for Bayern in the 10th minute, before defender Daniel Van Buyten made it two shortly after the half-hour mark. Bayern scored an incredible six goals in the second half -- Arjen Robben helping himself to a brace as did French midfielder Franck Ribery, while Gomez went on to complete his hat-trick four minutes from the end. Defender Marcel Eger scored a consolation goal for the hosts in the 78th minute but it was far too late for St Pauli to avoid their 20th league defeat of the season. But fellow strugglers Borussia Moenchengladbach are still in with a chance of completing a miraculous escape from relegation after they beat Freiburg 2-0 to record their third straight victory. The result lifts them to 16th, level on 35 points with Wolfsburg, who lost 2-1 to Kaiserslautern.

"(CNN) -- The Somali pirates who hijacked an Egyptian ship nearly 10 months ago have released it and the crew of 23 after receiving an air-dropped ransom of $2.3 million, officials said Tuesday. The MV Suez, laden with a cargo of cement, was sailing toward Eritrea under a Panamanian flag when it was hijacked August 2 by dozens of Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. Its crew of 11 Egyptians, six Pakistanis, four Indians and two Sri Lankans were taken hostage. ""The hijackers fed the sailors small amounts of rice,"" said Mohamed Sobhi, deputy chairman of the Red Sea Navigation Co. ""They need medical attention, and it was tough on their families. The ship should be protected by NATO forces to avoid another disaster on the way back."" The pirates had threatened to kill the the hostages on several occasions if the ransom was not paid, and their deadlines were extended when they were told the payment was being arranged, Sobhi said. Abdel Magid Mattar, chairman of Red Sea Navigation, which owns the ship, said the company paid $1.45 million and Pakistani donors paid another $850,000, and the crew was released over the weekend. ""The Foreign Ministries of Pakistan and Egypt assisted in the negotiations during the 10 months to ensure the release and safety of the sailors kidnapped while delivering the cement on board the merchant ship,"" Mattar said. A helicopter dispatched from South Africa dropped the money to the pirates. The 17,300-ton merchant vessel was expected to arrive at the Suez Canal within a week, Mattar said. Ansar Burney, a Pakistani-based human rights activist, conducted the negotiations with the pirates and raised the ransom money from Karachi, Mattar said. The Gulf of Aden, between Somalia and Yemen, has been the site of numerous pirate attacks on merchant vessels.","The MV Suez was hijacked August 2 in the Gulf of Aden .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A veteran social activist in India has launched an indefinite hunger strike to seek tough, overarching laws to tackle corruption as a rash of scandals undermined the reputation of the country's government. On Tuesday, activist Anna Hazare began his ""fast-unto-death"" at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar landmark. His campaign, supported by numerous social reformists, has come in the wake of a series of high-profile alleged scandals that have rocked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's administration and investor confidence in Asia's third largest economy. Hazare is demanding that a long-pending citizen ombudsman legislation, called the Lokpal bill, be widened in its scope. Hazare and his supporters reject the bill in its present form because it does not empower the proposed bodies to prosecute corruption suspects. Anti-graft crusaders have come up with their own draft of the legislation that seeks to create citizen ombudsman completely free from political influence and with wide-ranging jurisdiction. ""This fast-unto-death is a reflection of the people's anger at growing, all-round corruption ... at a time when the scourge is eating into the vitals of our society,"" said political commentator K.G. Suresh. A day before Hazare, 72, began his hunger strike, the office of the Indian prime minister expressed its ""deep disappointment"" over the protest. Singh's office noted in a statement that the prime minister met with Hazare and his colleagues last month. ""I appreciate and share your concern on corruption,"" the statement quoted Singh as having told Hazare. Nonetheless, a subsequent meeting between social activists and a federal committee ended unsuccessfully over demands the government accept their version of the bill in totality, Singh's office said. As politicians from different parties visited Hazare at Jantar Mantar, the reformist announced he would allow no leader to share his platform. Rather, Hazare alleged corruption was all pervasive in India's political establishment with only few exceptions. Last weekend, a former government minister in India was among a dozen defendants charged in a multi-billion-dollar telecom scandal. Andimuthu Raja, a former telecommunication minister, is accused of being involved in a scheme involving the underselling of cell phone licenses at the height of India's lucrative telecom boom. Police have questioned several high-profile executives in connection with the suspected below-price sale of radiowaves in 2008. Politicians, bureaucrats, and corporate officials linked to the probe have denied any wrongdoing. According to a government audit, the treasury lost as much as $31 billion from the 2008 sale of the second-generation wireless spectrum. The damning audit report came on the heels of allegations of massive fraud in sports and real estate. Two parliamentary committees are conducting separate inquiries into the case. Investigators are already probing complaints of financial malfeasance in the Commonwealth Games that India hosted in October last year. Several politicians, military officials, and bureaucrats have also been the subjects of a separate inquiry for allegedly taking apartments meant for war widows.","Hazare's fast-unto-death comes in the wake of a series of high-profile scandals .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. ALLIE, ROWAN COUNTY MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT: Hi, I'm Allie. SARAH, ROWAN COUNTY MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT: And I'm Sarah. We're from Rowan County Middle School in Morehead, Kentucky. We'd like to recognize Ms. Hood, our social studies teacher. ALLIE: And tell her how much we appreciate her for what she does for us. BOTH STUDENTS: We love you, Ms. Hood! CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: We love you too, Ms. Hood! And all of you teachers out there as Teacher Appreciation Week continues. I'm Carl Azuz. Your 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines start right now! First Up: Photo Release Debate . AZUZ: First up, President Obama is scheduled to meet with families of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The meeting's scheduled for this morning. And they're happening as he visits Ground Zero, the site of the World Trade Center, which was attacked on 9/11. The visit comes days after Osama bin Laden -- the man responsible for the 9/11 attacks -- was killed by U.S. forces. That happened at this compound in Pakistan. Yesterday, President Obama said the government won't release any pictures of bin Laden's body. This is a debate that's been going on since the terrorist leader's death. Should pictures be released as proof? The government confirmed it was bin Laden through DNA testing, but some people say that's not enough evidence; they want to see proof. One argument is that releasing a photo could anger terrorists who might want to retaliate against the U.S. Another argument is that if the photos are going to get out eventually, the government should release them now, on its own terms. Today's Daily Discussion questions at CNNStudentNews.com encourage you to consider the same questions that lawmakers are debating. What are the potential pros and cons of releasing these photos? And how might different groups of people react if the photos ever are released? Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Tate's social studies class at Laurens-Marathon Middle School in Laurens, Iowa! Which of these special operations groups is part of the U.S. Navy? You know what to do! Is it: A) Force Recon, B) Green Berets, C) SEALs or D) Combat Controllers? You've got three seconds -- GO! SEALs are part of the U.S. Navy; the name stands for Sea, Air and Land. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Mission Training . AZUZ: Sea, air and land, because the SEALs are trained to operate in all of those environments. SEALs have been an integral part of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And it was a group of these elite troops who carried out the operation that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Chris Lawrence shows us how they trained for this mission. (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: The team that killed Osama bin Laden had gone through thousands of scenarios for assaulting a compound, just like this group of Navy SEALs on U.S. soil. But the team that went after bin Laden was special, part of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or DEVGRU. STEW SMITH, FORMER NAVY SEAL: This SEAL team is the all-star of the SEAL teams. LAWRENCE: Stew Smith is a former SEAL who says the men in that raid have at least five years as special operators. SMITH: This SEAL team is based on combat experience. And all these guys probably have 100, 200 missions. LAWRENCE: The CIA provided detailed satellite pictures of bin Laden's compound, enough to build a replica where the SEAL team practiced. A senior defense official says for a time, they trained without knowing who their actual target was. But by Sunday, they knew the location of every gate and window in that compound, the exact height of the walls. JOHN BRENNAN, DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: They operated according to that, and they didn't know when they got there exactly what some of the internal features of it would be. LAWRENCE: The defense official says by the time the SEALs ran out of the house with bin Laden's body, they could probably count the exact number of steps to the helicopter outside. Special operator training is brutal. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's go, Johnson. Fletch just passed you up. LAWRENCE: But the men that took down bin Laden don't necessarily look like linebackers. SMITH: They have a great deal of muscle. Just not everybody is massive. You know, you don't have to be, you know, 6'5"", 250 pounds to be a SEAL. LAWRENCE: Two teams were supposed to fast rope down from the Blackhawks. But one helicopter had mechanical problems and had to land hard; put one team directly on the ground. There was a contingency plan, and the SEALs scrambled out to continue their mission. SMITH: There's a reason why they brought two helicopters. Because in the SEAL teams, we say two is one; one is none. And, you know, they knew what to do even in the event of a downed helicopter. (END VIDEO) Levee Concerns . AZUZ: Efforts to lower flood levels in the midwestern U.S. are working, but the threat is still there. We told you yesterday that officials are trying to help some communities by intentionally flooding other areas. We also talked about the tense debate over that plan. Rob Marciano is in Missouri, where this is happening. He filed this report yesterday on the explosive situation. (BEGIN VIDEO) ROB MARCIANO, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Day two of the exploding levee extravaganza. Extreme measures taken for, really, an extreme flood event. We haven't seen this level on the river here in Mississippi and along the Ohio since 1937. And yesterday, they blew up a second levee. Take a look at this video. Extraordinary stuff, during the daytime. Soil and earth being blown above the tree tops. That is at the opposite end of this floodway, so that some of this water can begin to drain. This is farmland. This is now not so good farmland, at least for this year. And that has a lot of farmers upset. There's class-action lawsuits happening, the state of Missouri not happy at all about this solution that they've had. We tracked down one farmer, a retired farmer, old timer who was here during the 1930s flood. And here's what he had to say about the situation. NORBERT ROLWING, RETIRED FARMER: Some of them are farming a lot of acres, and they've just been lucky these last few years that they haven't had a flood. This is one of the things that happens once in a great while, and they just had to take it on the chin. MARCIANO: Not just farmers who are getting hit with this. Lot of towns are evacuated, a lot of homes are completely flooded out. Yesterday, we went out with the Illinois DNR and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and they toured us around some areas that were really hit hard, Olive Branch among them. A lot of these folks aren't going to see the waters recede for several days, because what they have released here, now they're releasing more water upstream that's been held with all this rainfall. So, this is going to be a multiweek event that will be affecting millions of people all the way down into Louisiana. Reporting from Mississippi County, Missouri, I'm Rob Marciano. (END VIDEO) Storm Aftermath . AZUZ: The governor of Alabama says the road to recovery is going to be long and it's gonna be tough as his state struggles through the impact of deadly storms. The University of Alabama held a moment of silence yesterday, exactly one week after a tornado hit the town of Tuscaloosa. In this iReport, one Alabama resident talks about his experiences following this storm. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOSH SPURGIN, TORNADO SURVIVOR, IREPORTER: Everyone, this is Josh Spurgin, or @GoTeamJosh on Twitter. We're here at the remnants of my house from the tornadoes that came through on April 27, 2011. Tornadoes that came through and hit Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, all the other states that were affected. If you look from my front porch here, I mean just in the general area, practically every house here is completely flattened. There are people down the road, neighbors of mine, that are now dead. I have cousins, aunts, uncles all around. Completely flattened houses. I mean, there's trash and pictures, everything that's been found hundreds of miles away from here by other people. We're not here today to make you all upset and everything. I just wanted to make this video to thank those who have shown support to me, my family, friends of mine and others who've been affected by the tragedy. We've had plenty of support, me personally from people on Twitter, Facebook, everything. And I just wanted to thank everyone, so that's what this video is going to be about. (END VIDEO) AZUZ: You heard Mr. Spurgin talk about Twitter and Facebook. He turned to social media to let people know what he's going through, and social media is helping him recover, too. Celebrities that he contacted directly actually replied back to him, shared his story with others. Some simply asked, ""What can I do to help?"" Josh says it's helped to raise awareness and raise donations for him and his family. Sometimes it only takes 140 characters to make that kind of difference. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, you've heard the phrase ""lead by example."" Well, when a flash workout broke out during a ""Let's Move"" event in Washington, first lady Michelle Obama did just that. ""Let's Move"" is her campaign to fight childhood obesity, and this dance sequence was designed especially for it. These students might have known they were going to get down, but I bet they didn't expect to see the first lady getting down too. Goodbye . AZUZ: But that's the kind of experience that can't be beat. We're gonna turn the beat around and step up for another edition of CNN Student News tomorrow. Bennett's Mill Middle School: Thanks for visiting yesterday. We'll see y'all soon.","Hear President Obama's decision on releasing photos of Osama bin Laden .

"(CNN) -- The state of New Jersey is imposing harsher restrictions on Ferris wheel safety after an 11-year-old rider fell to her death earlier this month. Officials are mandating riders be at least 54 inches to ride without supervision, according to a letter from Michael Triplett of the New Jersey Carnival and Amusement Ride Safety Unit. Triplett also ""strongly recommended"" that each car have at least two riders, and added that if a manufacturer has a more strict requirement, that requirement should be followed. The changes coincide with the release of a preliminary report into the death of Abiah Jones of Pleasantville, New Jersey, who fell at Morey's Piers Mariner's Landing Pier, in Wildwood, on June 3. Jones, who met a 54-inch height requirement, was on a school trip when she fell from one of the park's main attractions, called The Great Wheel. After receiving first aid at the scene, she was taken to Cape Regional Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead. How the girl fell is still undetermined, and officials have no eyewitnesses, according to a report by the state of New Jersey. Surveillance footage showed her during the fall but did not show her leaving the gondola, the report said. It determined she entered the ride as a single rider and sustained ""significant head trauma as well as cuts on her arms and shoulders,"" hitting several objects on her way to the ground. The findings also concluded operators had no knowledge of any problems, the ride had no mechanical defects, and no other problems had been reported in its 25-year history. ""The fact that Abiah Jones was alone in the gondola, without any nearby passengers, may have led her to take a risk that she would have been convinced not to take if there were other riders in the gondola,"" the state investigator concluded. At 156 feet, the ride is one of the tallest wheels on the East Coast, Morey Piers spokeswoman Lindsey Young told CNN.","Riders must be 54 inches tall to ride without supervision, new rules mandate .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao continued his conquest of the boxing world Saturday night when he defeated ""Sugar"" Shane Mosley in Las Vegas. The Filipino fighter retained his World Boxing Organization welterweight title at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino. Pacquiao defeated Mosley by a unanimous decision, 119-108, 120-108, 120-107 after 12 rounds. Mosley came into the fight as a former three-time world champion. But the 39-year-old American was a clear underdog, in part from his having won only two of his past five fights. He endured grueling defeats to Floyd Mayweather Jr., and Miguel Cotto and a draw with Sergio Mora. Mosley put up a brave showing but was always on the back foot against Pacquiao, who knocked him down in the third round, the first time he had been on the canvas in nine years. ""After the first knockdown I felt I had him and I got him and that I could finish him,"" Pacquiao told gathered reporters after the fight. ""But the next round I have a problem with my left foot it is tight. ""I told my coach to press my legs because they are too tight."" Bothered by the cramp, Pacquiao was briefly floored himself in the 10th, but said the referee had apologized to him after the fight for a wrong decision in awarding the knockdown. The main reason Pacquiao, 32, was the heavy favorite was his own dominance of late. He is the first boxer ever to capture 10 world titles in eight weight divisions -- from flyweight (for boxers between 108 and 112 pounds) up to super welterweight (148 to 154 pounds). The Ring magazine, among other publications, ranks Pacquiao as the world's best pound-for-pound boxer. Entering Saturday night, he'd won 14 straight fights and compiled a professional record of 52 wins, three losses and two draws -- with 38 of those winning decisions coming by knockout. His exemplary record, obvious skill and international appeal -- especially in southeast Asia -- have helped make Pacquiao one of the world's most recognizable and admired boxers. But the native of General Santos city in the Philippines has proven he's more than just a fighter. Last year, he was elected as a federal congressman in the Philippines. Pacquiao has also dabbled in American politics, with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid crediting the Filipino's appearance at a last-minute rally in 2010 for helping seal his own election victory. He is also an aspiring singer, having appeared on U.S. shows such as ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" and released albums in Tagalog and English. Given the diversity and time-consuming nature of Pacquiao's interests, trainer Freddie Roach has been among those questioning how much longer the fighter known as ""Pacman"" will continue to fight in the ring. One of the biggest lingering questions involving Pacquiao is whether a much-touted showdown with Mayweather ever comes to fruition. Negotiations last year broke down amid accusations (including Mayweather's unverified claim Pacquiao used performance-enhancing drugs), recriminations and legal threats. Negotiations remain in limbo after Mayweather's arrests on suspicion of battery and larceny. CNN's Leif Coorlim contributed to this report.","Manny Pacquiao beats Shane Mosley to keep his world welterweight title .

"(CNN) -- Burt Reinhardt, a television pioneer who helped lead the evolution of 24-hour news coverage as president of CNN, died Tuesday at 91, according to family members. Reinhardt died in Georgia from complications of a series of strokes earlier this year, according to his daughter, Cheryl Reinhardt. Cable News Network founder Ted Turner remembered Reinhardt, who stayed away from the limelight, as an influential, if taciturn, executive. ""We both wanted to run a great news organization,"" Turner said. ""He just did a masterful job. He got the stories covered, but he did it within the budget."" After a stint as a vice president, Reinhardt served as CNN president from 1983 to 1990. He later was vice chairman of the organization until his retirement in 2000. Former CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour said Reinhardt was a leader who made the trains run on time. ""He had a steely demeanor, but had a heart of gold,"" said Amanpour, who said Reinhardt hired her as a producer-reporter in New York after she pleaded her case. ""I'm not sure CNN would be here without him,"" said Turner, who launched CNN in 1980. His colleague was an ""integral part of getting the whole operation going and keeping it going. He ran it close to 20 years."" A native of New York, Burton Reinhardt filmed U.S. Army Signal Corps combat footage during World War II, including Gen. Douglas MacArthur's historic return to the Philippines. Reinhardt later served as news editor for Fox Movietone News, according to his daughter. He also was vice president for United Press International Television News and executive vice president at Paramount Pictures, where he nurtured the development of home video. ""I tell people that in my opinion, he's probably the most important and powerful news executive you've never heard of,"" said nephew Harlan Reinhardt. Amanpour said Reihnardt's past as a World War II photographer helped. ""I realized there and then that this wasn't just an executive in a suit. It's a man who's been there. This is a man who's one of us. This is a man who was in the field who covered the wars and so he knew what it took to run a news operation like CNN and keep it afloat when everybody was digging its grave."" Reese Schoenfeld, who was the first president of CNN and was replaced by Reinhardt, said Reinhardt's work was pivotal to the growth of the network. ""He was a person of integrity and a great newsman,"" said Schoenfeld. ""I'm not sure that I would've had the financial discipline or the capability of doing that nearly as well as Burt did and it really saved the company -- it's the only reason CNN exists today. Tom Johnson, who replaced Reinhardt as CNN's third president, said he developed an unusual relationship with him over the years. ""I will never forget that after Ted Turner and I reached an agreement that I would become the new president of CNN in 1990, I asked Ted, could I retain Burt Reinhardt as vice chairman of the company,"" Johnson said. ""Most new CEO's coming in do not wish to have the former CEO around. But I just felt I needed - I needed Burt."" Johnson also credited Reinhardt for steering the news organization through trying financial times. ""I'm sure a lot of people will talk about Burt's fiscal responsibility. but I think what set Burt apart from everyone else who has been at CNN was that he was quietly strong,"" said Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide. ""And behind the scenes, this man has integrity and he's very competitive, but he wants to do things the right way. He's fair, but firm and he treated everyone with respect."" Reinhardt helped solidify the CNN logo as a strong symbol. The logo, now commonly known as a ""bug"" in broadcast jargon, is almost always on the television screen during CNN's news coverage. This idea was the brainchild of Reinhardt. Reinhardt, who grew up in the Bronx, is survived by his wife, Diana Shaw; children, Cheryl Reinhardt of Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Gary Reinhardt of Provincetown, Massachusetts; and one grandchild. He was predeceased by son, Barry, and his identical twin, Sheldon. CNN's Richard Roth, Katie Silver and Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report.","Burt Reinhardt was a key CNN executive during the network's crucial early years .

"(CNN) -- Live ammunition fired by Yemeni security forces left 11 protesters dead in Sanaa and Taiz on Wednesday, witnesses said, as a human rights group called for an end to the use of deadly force by government troops. Doctors and eyewitnesses in the cities told CNN that another 169 people had been injured, some critically. ""Shots are heard everywhere in Sanaa,"" a witness told CNN. Journalists and medical sources said eight people were killed in the capital when Republican guards began shooting directly at demonstrators in the eastern and northern parts of Change Square.  At least 65 people were injured, the sources said, 12 critically. They added that more than 100 additional people suffered injuries from rocks or batons. ""Security forces are aiming for a massacre in Sanaa,"" said Abdul Wahab Anesi, a medical staff spokesman at a field hospital set up in Change Square. Before Republican Guards began firing at protesters in the square, they reportedly clashed with military personnel who had been protecting demonstrators gathered there.  Journalists, medical sources and other witnesses told CNN that these soldiers defected two months ago along with Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar, who withdrew his support from President Ali Abdullah Saleh in late March.  At the time, he promised to protect civilians demonstrating against the president. In addition to the casualties in the capital, three people were killed and four were reported critically injured in Taiz. ""The attack took place while we were chanting, 'One more week left for you, Saleh,'"" said Sabir Ali, a protester in Taiz. The protesters were giving Saleh a week to step down, saying if he does not, they will make good on a vow to march to the presidential palace. Earlier, a senior security official denied that forces fired on protesters in Taiz. ""Security forces were preventing attacks on civilians led by gangs of the opposition,"" the official said. ""Security forces did not shoot at protesters. Gangs of the JMP were the shooters."" The JMP stands for the joint meeting parties, a coalition of opposition parties. ""Security forces kill people, then deny the incident,"" said Ahmad Bahri, head of the political office at the opposition Haq party. ""This is why the Yemeni revolution is taking place."" He said the protesters were unarmed and were marching peacefully when they were shot. Those who died were shot in the head, Bahri said. Civil disobedience was also seen in the cities of Abyan, Aden, Ibb, Hodeida and Amran, according to reports. Amnesty International, in a release Wednesday, again called on Yemen's government to stop the use of deadly force against anti-government protesters. ""Security forces in Yemen must be immediately stopped from using live ammunition on unarmed protesters,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa.  ""The Yemeni government must allow its people to express their genuine grievances without fear of violence and killing. It must also ensure that justice is done for all those killed unlawfully while exercising their right to peaceful protest."" The high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy, Catherine Ashton, echoed that call in a statement released Wednesday. ""I am following with the utmost concern the developments in Yemen,"" Ashton said.  ""I condemn in the strongest terms the ongoing violence and repression against protesters in Sanaa, Taiz and other cities. I call on the government and security forces to end the use of violence immediately."" Ashton urged Yemeni groups to sign a political transition agreement worked out by the Gulf Cooperation Council, and to implement it without delay. The agreement stipulates that Saleh transfer power and leave office within 30 days of signing the deal.  It also provides immunity for him and those who served in his regime and calls for a unity government to be formed within seven days. Protesters calling themselves Revolution Youth had called for a civil disobedience day on Wednesday. More than 95% of the shops in Taiz were closed, according to witnesses. On Monday, medical officials said at least six people were killed and hundreds were wounded when teachers, accompanied by opponents of Saleh's government, demonstrated against salary cuts. Witnesses said security forces fired on the protesters after dispersing marchers with batons and tear gas. CNN cannot independently verify the witnesses' accounts. Saleh's impoverished and unstable nation has been wracked by anti-government protests and clashes between demonstrators and security forces for many weeks.","Live ammunition is used against protesters in Sanaa and Taiz, witnesses say .

"(CNN) -- Life tends to be simpler, slower, safer in Abbottabad than in many Pakistani cities. Drivers take their time on the winding mountain roads. Streets are largely empty at night, with people routinely turning in by 9 p.m. And violence found in tribal areas near the Afghanistan border, in the disputed territory of Kashmir, and denser cities including Lahore and Islamabad typically has no place in Abbottabad. Until Monday morning, that is. That's when Abbottabad went from a sleepy northern Pakistani city 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad to the site of a bloody and historic firefight. There, in a city heavily populated with Pakistani army personnel, a handful of American special forces executed a daring 40-minute raid in which they killed Osama bin Laden, the world's most well-known terrorist leader. The electricity was out in Abbottabad early Monday, recalled city resident Sohair Athar. This was not an especially unusual occurrence, he said. Nor was the buzz of a helicopter overhead, especially given the abundance of such flights since massive floods ravaged the region. But the freelance software engineer, who also owns a coffee shop in town, noticed the helicopter didn't land immediately, as they usually do. Instead it hovered, prompting him to write on his Twitter feed: ""Go away helicopter - before I take out my giant swatter :-/."" Shortly thereafter, Athar -- who had come to the typically restive city of Abbottabad in part for peace and security from Lahore -- heard a loud explosion. ""I thought to myself, I had moved all the way to Abbottabad from Lahore only to avoid bomb blasts and violence, and now this had even followed me even here,"" Athar told CNN. Fayez Noor, a 24-year-old student at the Institute of Information and Technology, heard three explosions in all. After the first one at 1:08 a.m., he texted a friend to ask him what happened. The last -- coming just three minutes later -- was the biggest. ""My house, which is three kilometers (two miles) away (from the bid Laden compound), shook and the glass in the windows rattled,"" Noor recalled. Helicopters were seen, too, heading out. Noor said that one flew over his house, while Sahndana Syed, a doctor in the city, saw one final chopper flying off very low. ""Initially, I was too afraid to go out,"" Syed said. ""I was terrified."" But within just a few minutes, by 1:15 a.m., the power was back on. ""I did not think much of it, other than these were odd occurrences,"" recalled Athar. ""I shut my laptop and walked away."" As people went to sleep, Pakistani TV stations reported it was all part of a Pakistani military exercise. It was not until after dawn that the facts became evident: one of the world's most wanted fugitives, bin Laden, had been living in their midst and was now dead, killed by U.S. forces. ""It came as a big surprise,"" said Syed, the 28-year-old doctor. ""Nobody knew."" By the next day, the blockage of streets around the housing compound where bin Laden lived was the most visible reminder of the raid. Residents talked over tea about the fact the mastermind of the September 11, 2001, and other attacks, just a few hours earlier, had lived in their midst -- and that a foreign military, too, had descended on their city.

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- At least one miner is fighting acute pneumonia, two will need dental surgery, and others have skin problems or lesions in their eyes. Yet for all the 33 miners' challenges the past 69 days, trapped a half-mile underground in the San Jose mine without light, health care and other basics, those who have emerged appear surprisingly healthy, Chile's health minister said. ""Things are extraordinarily well, better than expected,"" Jaime Manalich said Wednesday. ""They really are in good condition -- emotional condition and physical condition."" After getting out of the capsule, each miner stood up and reconnected with loved ones. Some of them engaged the throngs nearby. Within minutes, though, all were placed on stretchers and whisked away to get medical care. While Manalich said ""no major problems"" have been found, all the rescued miners will be carefully monitored at a nearby hospital in the coming hours and days. Experts said some of the aftereffects of the long stay underground and quick trip to the surface -- especially mental effects, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or restless nights -- may be felt for years to come. The miners do not have to be flown to Copiapo Regional Hospital, Manalich said. However, officials strongly recommended it, and the miners have agreed to go, he said. Many of the miners rescued by late Wednesday afternoon had few evident medical problems, Manalich said, and dizziness was not a problem because the rescue capsule did not rotate as much as officials feared. Even so, all of the miners will be evaluated by specialists, including ophthalmologists, dermatologists and psychologists. They are being housed in a brand-new ward that was completed two months before the August 5 collapse at the San Jose mine. The hospital has spent weeks preparing for the miners, said hospital director Hernan Rojas. ""We've been ready since Day One of this disaster,"" he said last month. Some miners may be released as early as Thursday afternoon, Manalich said, while others will stay longer at the hospital. That includes at least two men who need dental surgery and one miner, whom Manalich would not identify, who is expected to remain hospitalized through the weekend. That miner's symptoms emerged four days ago, and he was already being treated with antibiotics and improving about 24 hours before being brought to the surface, Manalich said. Besides physical maladies, in the coming days doctors will keep an eye out for nightmares, panic attacks, anxiety and claustrophobia, among other potential issues. They must be reintegrated with their families and society and deal with their sudden celebrity status and media attention. One expert has said the specter of post-traumatic stress disorder looms large. Dr. Michael Duncan, the deputy chief medical officer at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, told CNN, ""The work is just beginning when the miners get out of the mine."" If the miners are given a clean bill of health, they will be released to their families. Some concerns linger due to their lack of sunlight, nutrition questions, the effects of their confinement, lack of sleep and sanitation issues. Because they have been isolated for so long, they could be more susceptible to the common cold or other viruses. Extensive precautions were taken to minimize health risks before the miners were rescued. Two Chilean Army nurses were sent down to the mine ahead of all the miners' rescue to help them prepare for their trip to the surface, Manalich said. One of them focused exclusively on the miner with pneumonia, who had an oxygen mask on his face when he came up. ""They have an anemic condition, and right now they have been sleeping less these last few days,"" Manalich said earlier Wednesday. ""They're tired and they still have long hours of waiting in order to be able to come up to the surface and to meet with their families."" The miners were switched to a liquid diet six hours before their rescue in case they vomit on the way up. Because Chilean Mining Minister Laurence Golborne was concerned about the miners being reintroduced to sunlight abruptly, special sunglasses were sent down for the men to wear to make sure they don't suffer damage to their retinas. While underground, they were given special clothing that pulls sweat away from the body because of concern about skin infections, as well as special socks to help prevent infections like athlete's foot. They also had a series of vaccinations including a tetanus booster and flu shot. They have been exercising daily, and one miner, Yonni Barrios, is a paramedic who has been weighing his colleagues daily and taking blood tests and daily urine samples. American astronaut Jerry Linenger knows something about isolation and confinement. He says his five months in space aboard the Russian space station Mir left him weak and with bone loss. ""Down in the mines you have gravity pulling you down. There will be disorientation -- turning your head will feel like doing 100 backflips in a row,"" he said. The miners that have come up are showing slight increases in blood pressure and cardiac activity during the trip, but they recovered satisfactorily after a few minutes of rest and have not required medication, Manalich said. The health minister added later that, emotionally, he was surprised by how well the men were doing. Still, experts warn that psychological adjustments may remain a hurdle for the miners. ""These men spent 20 days totally cut off in the dark until the first bore hole was made,"" Linenger said. ""So they were in survival mode, which is tough psychologically because you are in a life-and-death situation."" CNN's Karl Penhaul, Patrick Oppmann, Saundra Young and Madison Park contributed to this report.","One miner suffering from pneumonia, two need dental surgery .

"MOSCOW, Russia (Reuters) -- A Moscow court began trying a supermarket worker who prosecutors say murdered 49 people over a 14-year period, which would make him Russia's worst serial killer in a decade. Pichushkin is accused of luring victims to his flat before smashing them to death with a hammer. His lawyer said 33-year-old Alexander Pichushkin had confessed to most of the murders, but it was unclear how many. The jury must decide whether or not he is of sound mind. ""My client understands that he is to blame for most of these murders,"" Pichushkin's lawyer, Pavel Ivannikov, told reporters outside the courtroom after a fifteen-minute hearing. Pichushkin scowled as he was brought into Moscow City Court under heavy guard for a preliminary hearing at which he opted to be tried by a jury, instead of a panel of judges. If convicted, Pichushkin -- called the ""Bitsevsky Maniac"" by Russian media after the Moscow park where many of the alleged victims were killed -- would be Russia's most deadly serial killer since Andrei Chikatilo, convicted in 1992 of 52 murders. Prosecutors say Pichushkin befriended many of his victims in Bitsevsky park by inviting them to drink vodka with him, then bludgeoned them to death with a hammer. Some of the victims had fragments of glass pressed into their skulls. Prosecutors also say Pichushkin confessed to the murders in police custody. Russian media reported that for every person he killed, he placed a coin on a chess board and that he had been planning to cover all 64 squares on the board. The trial was adjourned until September 13 to allow time for a jury to be selected. It is expected to be lengthy, as it will hear from at least 41 relatives of the alleged victims and a total of 98 other witnesses. During the hearing, relatives of two of the alleged victims sat just meters from Pichushkin. The accused occasionally stretched his arms and stared out from the glass enclosure where he was held, without displaying any emotion. In a red and white checked shirt and jeans, he looked older than his age, with gray peppering his dark hair. Speaking quietly before the hearing, one middle aged man, Alexander Fyodorov, recalled his family's efforts to track down his missing brother, who would be 47 this year. ""I want Pichushkin to sit in prison for the rest of his life,"" he said. Although Russia has not formally abolished the death penalty, it has been observing a moratorium on capital punishment. Another elderly woman who was also in the court, Tamara Klimova, came home from holiday to discover her husband was missing. The body was not found for five years. Prosecutors now believe he was killed by Pichushkin. ""I would like him to be handed over to the people so that they can tear him apart,"" Klimova told reporters.

"(CNN) -- Kim Clijsters is looking forward to taking a break after her title reign at the Miami Masters ended at the quarterfinal stage. The 27-year-old, also the 2005 winner in Florida, could not repeat her heroic effort against Ana Ivanovic as she was beaten 6-3 6-3 by eighth seed Victoria Azarenka on Wednesday. The Belgian had saved five match-points before overcoming Ivanovic in the previous round, but admitted she was drained after stepping back on court less than 24 hours later. ""I just didn't feel good out there. Just mentally, physically, it didn't feel right,"" the Australian Open champion told the WTA Tour website. ""Physically it was tough the last few days, but I train hard enough to be capable of doing that. Nadal and Federer close on semi clash . ""Mentally I just didn't have any fighting spirit. It's tough against someone like Victoria -- against some lower-ranked players it's possible to get through matches, but not her. ""I'm just looking forward to a break right now. It can't be long because we have Fed Cup in a couple of weeks, so probably a few days, get settled at home."" Clijsters, who briefly reclaimed the No. 1 ranking from Caroline Wozniacki after reaching the final in Paris in February, could now lose second place after failing to reach the semifinals for the second successive event. Vera Zvonareva can move back above Clijsters if she wins the title at the U.S. hard-court event. The third seed will next play Azarenka, having beaten Polish No. 9 Agnieszka Radwanska 7-5 6-3 in her earlier quarterfinal. Zvonareva and Azarenka are the only players to have beaten Clijsters more than once since the three-time U.S. Open champion's return from retirement in 2009. Azarenka, who has a 2-6 losing record against the Russian, won the 2009 title in Miami but was beaten by Clijsters in Florida in the fourth round last year. This time she led 6-3 5-1 before Clijsters -- who made eight double-faults in losing her serve six times -- saved two match-points. ""She went for her shots and stayed in the match until the end. I knew it would be tough and I was ready,"" the Belarusian said. ""I have to play on a high level, because Vera is a very consistent player. She is showing some of the best tennis of her life right now, so I have to be aggressive and focused."" The other semifinal, also to be played on Thursday, sees Zvonareva's compatriot Maria Sharapova bid to reach her third Miami final against Germany's Andrea Petkovic. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic continued his hot run of form as he reached the semifinals of the men's event with a 6-4 6-2 crushing of South Africa's Kevin Anderson on Wednesday. The Serbian, who beat world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in the final at Indian Wells almost two weeks ago, is now undefeated in 22 matches this year. The world No. 2 lost to Anderson in the second round in Miami three years ago, but progressed in one hour and 48 minutes to give himself a chance of a second title in Florida -- having won in 2007 and finished runner-up to Andy Murray in 2009. The 23-year-old will next face Mardy Fish, who has beaten in all five previous meetings, after the 14th seed eliminated Australian Open semifinalist David Ferrer in the day's opening men's match. Fish won 7-5 6-2 against the Spanish sixth seed to ensure that he will become the top-ranked American for the first time, above two-time Miami champion Andy Roddick, when the new list is released next week. Roddick's title defense ended with a second-round defeat by 67th-ranked Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas last week. Fish is hopeful that he can beat Djokovic, who has not dropped his serve in the tournament and has lost only 14 games in four matches so far. ""He's not going to win every single match this year. Whether it be this week or in July, he's not going to win every one. It's just not possible. So hopefully it can be me,"" the 29-year-old said. In Thursday's men's quarterfinals, two-time runner-up Nadal will take on Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych while world No. 3 Roger Federer plays French 25th seed Gilles Simon as he seeks his third title here.","Victoria Azarenka ends Kim Clijsters' hopes of a third title in Miami hard-court event .

"(CNN) -- People up and down the Mississippi River could feel the effects from this week's epic flooding long after the water recedes. Farmers may face a major disruption to their livelihood in places where the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opens spillways to drain water from the swollen river onto adjacent land. ""If you have a pasture where you grow soybeans and it gets flooded by 25 feet of floodwaters and you end up with 3 feet of oozing mud on top of your pasture, it's going to be a long time before you can plow -- certainly one year,"" said Sam Bentley, a professor of sedimentary geology at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. ""It might be arable next year, but it would probably be quite difficult to work."" There's also a chance that floodwaters could spill into wetlands and damage oyster beds near where the Mississippi River meets the Gulf of Mexico. ""They don't like to be buried in mud,"" said Ivor van Heerden of the oysters.  Van Heerden is former deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center and now a private consultant. How bad will it be in Louisiana, where the swollen Mississippi is headed? Experts held out hope that the floodwaters forecast for much of the Lower Mississippi River will exact a minimum toll in lives lost. Yet they appeared resigned to the likelihood of steep property losses. If a system of levees holds, then floodwater will be discharged only where the Corps of Engineers plans to discharge water, Bentley said. ""There will be property lost, hopefully no lives, but according to a plan executed by the Corps of Engineers as opposed to a rapidly unfolding catastrophe,"" he said. A failure in the system of levees would change the landscape considerably, he said, though he does not expect that. ""I wouldn't say that this is going to be a disaster, but the modern Mississippi levee system has never been tested under flood conditions like this,"" he said. ""It's probably going to exceed water levels not seen since the Great Flood of 1927 -- historically the largest ever measured."" That flood led Congress in 1928 to authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to build the system of levees and other controls now under stress. Farmers in parts of Louisiana could face a long recovery, particularly if authorities open the Morganza Spillway near Baton Rogue to lower water levels on the Mississippi River. Roy Dakka, a professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the Center for Geoinformatics at Louisiana State University, predicted it will take weeks to months for the farmland to dry. ""Any existing crops are going to be toast,"" he said, citing the fields of corn, sugar cane and soybeans that will be covered with sediment. ""Plus, God knows what's in the water and what gets deposited."" If the floodwaters remain on the ground for 30 days or so, ""then we probably would not be able to get a crop in this year,"" said Roger Carter, president of Agricultural Management Services, an agricultural consultant firm in Clayton, Louisiana. ""Most of our crops are already planted in the floodplains. They would be destroyed."" He said he was comfortable that the levee would hold, but added that, if it breaks, ""that would be a catastrophe ... it could be years before we could replace that infrastructure."" Any farmers who wind up losing a year's worth of crops will likely be forced out of the business, since insurance would not cover their losses adequately, he said. In all, Bentley predicted, the floods will affect three major areas in the Lower Mississippi Delta, which begins around Baton Rouge and ends in the Gulf of Mexico. Some 80 miles north of Baton Rouge, the Atchafalaya River diverges from the Mississippi and flows down to the Gulf. The entire Atchafalaya Basin will get from 5 feet to 25 feet of water going down the Atchafalaya, whose surroundings are less populated than the area around the Mississippi River. ""It's a safer place to discharge water in terms of the human cost,"" he said. ""At the same time, there are tens of thousands of people who live there."" The second area of significance is Lake Pontchartrain, a major estuary north of New Orleans that will receive floodwater from the Bonnet Carre Spillway. Bentley predicted that the fertilizer and waste deposited in Lake Pontchartrain will result in ""extensive"" blooms of algae by midsummer. ""This is essentially a large, unplanned sediment transport experiment,"" he said, adding that he plans to study how effectively coastal bays, lakes and estuaries trap sediment to build new land. The ratio of how much is deposited versus how much is washed out by tides determines how fast land can be built, ""which is what we need to do in order to rebuild the Mississippi River Delta,"" he said. The third area is the Mississippi River below New Orleans, which is protected by ""very low and relatively weak levees,"" Bentley said. Though the area is largely unpopulated, it is a major navigational channel. Were any place in the Mississippi River system to experience a breach in a levee, that could lead to a change in the river channel, he said. He pointed to areas near the town of Port Sulphur as particularly vulnerable. ""Those are areas where the levees get low and weak."" Under the best-case scenario, the Army Corps of Engineers will prove able to manage the water flow and flooding will be minor. But there is little doubt that property will be lost and the economy will take a hit, Dakka said. ""On the other hand, the worst-case scenario is that the water rises, we're not able to manage it, it finds the weak areas, exploits those vulnerabilities, perhaps even segments of the river levee get taken out by erosion or collapse due to failure of saturated levees or other things could happen -- ships get loose in the river, barges of chemicals run into the side of the levee."" If levees break, weeks could pass before engineers could reseal them, he said. But Dakka said his worst-case scenario might not tell the whole story. ""There are unintended consequences that are going to happen that we can't possibly even fathom right now,"" he said. ""We just have to be ready for it, and get people out of the way."" If wide-scale flooding occurs, the resulting economic damage will be felt for years, he predicted. ""Any city that ever floods never really returns economically to where it once was because people don't have confidence, people don't want to put businesses there. New Orleans is the big example."" Already, even before the slow-motion disaster has unfolded, policymakers should have learned some lessons, he said. One of them is that flood plains should not have been developed. ""Nature wins in the end,"" he said, ""And I just hope that we've done enough planning that we can basically at least hold it back this one more time."" ""We should really be thinking about whether we want to continue to live in really stupid places, because nature is going to exploit our stupidity,"" Dakka said.","Hope prevails that the levee system for the Mississippi River will hold .

"(CNN) -- A man serving 74 life sentences for kidnapping two Missouri boys and holding one of them for more than four years was assaulted by another inmate, officials said Wednesday. Michael Devlin, 45, received superficial puncture wounds from a homemade weapon, said Chris Cline, spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections. Cline said he could not identify the other inmate, a motive or other matters related to an investigation of the April 9 incident. Devlin is being held in ""administrative segregation"" from other inmates at Crossroads Correctional Center in Cameron, Cline told CNN. He was taken to a hospital and was returned to the maximum-security prison, Cline said. The parents of one boy, whom Devlin is accused of abducting in 2002, told Oprah Winfrey in a show that aired in 2007 that they suspected their son was sexually assaulted by Devlin. Prosecutors alleged that Devlin produced Polaroid photographs and videos of the youth, then 11, and took him to Illinois and Arizona. The two boys were discovered in January 2007. The second victim, 13 at the time, was abducted a few days before Devlin's arrest. Devlin, a former pizzeria manager, has two reported conduct violations since his 2007 incarceration, according to Cline, who would not describe them. The inmate's 79 convictions include attempted murder, forcible sodomy, attempted forcible sodomy, armed criminal actions and kidnapping. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Officials: Michael Devlin, serving life sentences, attacked with homemade weapon .

"Washington (CNN) -- There was a time not too long ago when 19-year-old Derontae Mason slept in homeless shelters and school playgrounds. Now Mason is heading to college with his sights set on becoming a pediatrician, thanks to the Don Bosco Cristo Rey High School in Takoma Park, Maryland, a Catholic college prep school for low-income teens. ""I had many obstacles that came across my way and made me want to be like, just forget it, throw in the towel you know? But the teachers, the staff, friends, family they all pulled together with Don Bosco and helped me overcome those obstacles,"" said Mason. Mason is part of Don Bosco's first graduating class of 70 students, all of whom have already been accepted to various colleges and universities, said Rev. Steve Shafran, president of Don Bosco Cristo Rey. High school wasn't always easy for him. In his junior year, one of his close friends was killed in a drive-by shooting. But his teachers kept prodding him to stay on track, and now, Mason is bound for Potomac State college in West Virginia on a scholarship. ""For me, Derontae is a great story for a lot of inner city kids that don't have hope, that don't have somebody to help them move forward,"" Shafran said. Domestic problems and personal conflicts forced Mason out to the streets when he was 15. As one of six children being raised by a single mom with little money, he was in and out of homeless shelters. A child advocate first alerted Mason's mother about Don Bosco, one of 24 schools in the country that use the Cristo Rey model: a combination of employment and academics. Students must work at one of the school's designated job partners. The students are paid when the employer makes a financial contribution to the school. So, as it turns out, the students are working their way through school. ""They're picking up the culture of that corporate environment. They see the people that are there, and they're picking up some great skills of interaction that's helping to mold them and their own character,"" said Shafran. For Mason, Don Bosco went even further, helping to arrange housing so he wouldn't have to sleep on the streets. Families of other students at the school agreed on a rotation to let Mason to stay in their homes. For Mason, it's just the beginning. A determined, soft-spoken young man, Mason said he will always cherish his four years at the high school. ""I walk away from Don Bosco knowing I have people who care about me, more determination, perseverance than I can ever imagine.""

"(CNN) -- Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan Solomon tearfully pleaded Thursday for leniency for her brother, who was sentenced to prison on a lesser charge in his fatal altercation with their father. A Middlesex County Superior Court judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to 2.5 years after a jury convicted him Wednesday of assault and battery. A jury acquitted Kerrigan on an involuntary manslaughter charge. The prosecution argued that the elder Kerrigan died from a heart attack caused during a physical struggle. Solomon asked Judge Jane Haggerty for no prison time for her brother, saying the family had already suffered enough trauma and hardship. ""None of us have had really the chance to grieve for our father,"" she said in court. Mark Kerrigan was taken into custody immediately, said Cara O'Brien, spokeswoman for the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office. The judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to serve two years in prison, followed by two years of probation, during which he will have to satisfy several conditions, including mental health and alcohol abuse treatment, according to O'Brien. If Kerrigan completes all the conditions, the remaining six months of his prison sentence will be suspended, the judge ruled. Mark Kerrigan showed little emotion as the verdict was read Wednesday in Woburn, Massachusetts. ""My family has never believed at all that my brother had anything to do with my father's death,"" Nancy Kerrigan said outside the courthouse. ""My dad would never have wanted any of this."" Prosecutors say Daniel Kerrigan, 70, died after having an argument and physical confrontation with his intoxicated son. A medical examiner had found that Daniel Kerrigan's 2010 death came from cardiac dysrhythmia triggered by the brawl, which resulted in a larynx injury. Cardiac dysrhythmia is abnormal electrical activity in the heart. Kerrigan's family has said Daniel Kerrigan had a heart condition.","Mark Kerrigan was acquitted of involuntary manslaughter .

"(CNN) -- The European Union slapped sanctions on 13 top Syrian officials, including President Bashar al-Assad's brother, for ""violence against demonstrators,"" it announced Tuesday. Maher al-Assad, the president's youngest brother, is commander of the army's 4th Division and ""principal overseer"" of the crackdown against protesters, the EU said. The head of Syrian intelligence, Ali Mamlouk, and Interior Minister Mohammad Ibrahim al-Chaar were also sanctioned, along with 10 other intelligence, security and business officials. Their assets in Europe are being frozen, and they're now subject to an arms embargo and travel ban. Syria has been cracking down forcefully for weeks on anti-government protesters inspired by the ""Arab Spring"" sweeping across the region. Protesters have demanded the immediate release of political prisoners, lifting of emergency and martial law, and withdrawal of intelligence forces from Syrian cities. Syrian officials describe the protesters as ""conspirators"" promoting ""sedition."" On Tuesday, Syrian presidential adviser Bouthaina Shaaban told The New York Times that she believed the government had gotten the upper hand.  ""I hope we are witnessing the end of the story,"" she said.  ""I think now we've passed the most dangerous moment. I hope so, I think so."" State-run news agency SANA reported on the interview with the headline: ""Dr. Shaaban: We are witnessing the end of the story."" The Times said that for the story, a reporter was allowed into Syria for only a few hours. SANA also reported Tuesday that 2,684 ""rioters"" had ""surrendered"" and been released after pledging ""not to repeat any action against the security of the citizen and the homeland."" Also, four ""martyrs from the army forces, who were targeted by extremist terrorist groups in Homs,"" were buried, SANA reported Tuesday. Last month, al-Assad lifted the country's 48-year-old state of emergency and abolished the state security court, both of which were key demands of the demonstrators. But anti-government protests have continued, with activists alleging massive human rights abuses and calling for political and economic reforms. Security forces have relied heavily on the army and the regime's guard to disperse demonstrations. Syrian security forces have been using soccer stadiums as makeshift prisons in at least two cities -- Banias and Daraa, the center of the uprising -- after raiding homes and arresting hundreds of residents, the directors of two human rights organizations said Monday. In addition, security forces burst into homes and took residents into custody in the Damascus suburb of Modemiyah, where there were reports of gunfire Monday, said Rami Abdul-Rahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. And in the city of Homs, a doctor said tanks were dispersed and security checkpoints were set up at the entrance to each suburb, with security forces, often backed by secret police, searching anyone passing through. The security presence was so heavy that people were afraid to demonstrate, the resident said. The witness in Homs said he knew several people killed in demonstrations Friday who could not be buried, because security forces were not allowing funerals out of fear they might turn into demonstrations. The doctor said he has seen several public buildings, including two health centers and a school, transformed into command and control centers for the Syrian security forces and military. Dozens of people have ""disappeared,"" and their families believe they have been arbitrarily detained, the doctor said. A U.N. humanitarian assessment team due to enter Syria was stopped, despite having previously been given permission by authorities, a U.N. spokesman said Monday. The mission was set to visit the southern city of Daraa. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said Monday the United Nations was trying to clarify why it wasn't able to enter. More than 400 people have been arrested in Banias since Saturday, Abdul-Rahman said, adding that authorities had converted the Mediterranean city's soccer stadium into a prison to house them. In Daraa, another human rights organization observed a similar situation. ""In Daraa, there have been so many arbitrary arrests in recent days that the army and security forces are using schools and the city's soccer stadium as makeshift prison facilities,"" said Ammar Qurabi, chairman of the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria. The heads of both organizations are not in Syria but remain in close contact with activists and protesters there. CNN has not been granted access into Syria and is unable to independently verify witness accounts. Amnesty International said Friday that more than 540 people have been killed by Syrian security forces and that many activists in pro-reform protests ""have been forced into hiding after receiving threats from Syrian authorities.""  On Monday, Amnesty said at least 48 people were killed by security forces in Syria ""in the last four days,"" according to local and international human rights activists.","NEW: Syrian official thinks ""the most dangerous moment"" has passed .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Guests at restaurants in Argentina's Buenos Aires province must say good-bye to the salt shaker. In an effort to combat hypertension, which affects some 3.7 million residents in the province -- nearly a quarter of the population, the health department reached an agreement with the hotel and restaurant federation to remove salt shakers from the tables at their eateries. ""On average, each Argentinian consumes 13 grams of salt daily, while according to the World Health Organization, you should consume less than five,"" Health Minister Alejandro Collia said when he announced the change last month. The measure is not as extreme as it sounds. Salt will be available by request, but only after the patrons have tasted their food. The government also signed an agreement with the local breadmakers federation to reduce by 40% the amount of sodium in bread sold in the province. ""To reduce consumption (of salt), we will recommend to the breadmakers to reduce to 750 grams of salt per bag of 50 kilograms of flour, that is, 100 less grams that what is normally added,"" said Ruben Salvio, head of the breadmakers federation. Collia said that if Buenos Aires residents can reduce their daily salt intake by three grams, it could save about 2,000 lives a year. Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, has been linked to high salt and sodium consumption, but there is still debate on the issue. A study by European researchers released just weeks before the new Buenos Aires salt restrictions discounted the link between salt and hypertension. ""The chef or cook already in preparing (a meal) puts salt on it, and the client without tasting it adds more salt on top,"" said restuarant owner Hector Toublanc. Guests were divided on the new measure. ""For me, this is perfect,"" said retiree Angelica Slom. ""In reality I would not miss (a salt shaker) if it was not on the table."" Businessman Hugo Verlandi had a problem with the restrictions. ""I am against prohibitions,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Firefighters have stopped the northward advance of the second-largest wildfire in recorded Arizona history and are now focusing on its eastern flank, crossing the New Mexico border to build suppression lines meant to starve the flames into submission, authorities said Monday. Light winds after dark and an atmospheric inversion will hold smoke at the surface overnight going into Tuesday morning, authorities said. The Wallow Fire has burned 706 square miles, officials said Monday, up from 694 square miles the day before. The fire remains about 10% contained. Calmer winds were helping firefighters get the upper hand on the fire, which has been burning since late May, said Jerome MacDonald, the operations chief for the Southwest Incident Management team. Efforts to return residents to Greer, part of which was burned in the fire, are under way, said Fire Chief Mark Wade. ""Greer is not as bad as a lot of people are making it sound,"" he said. But he warned that there are dangerous obstacles that must be cleared and utilities to be restored before residents can be allowed back in. Residents were already moving back to the towns of Springerville, Eagar and South Fork after authorities lifted evacuation orders on Sunday. Authorities warned residents of the towns, about 170 miles east-northeast of Phoenix, that air quality could continue to be a problem, and food in refrigerators may have spoiled. But officials with both cities disputed a state suggestion that water supplies might be contaminated. ""Our water is pure, and it always has been,"" said Springerville town manager Steve West. Vicki Walker of Eagar has made up her mind to return, according to her husband, Kelvin. She, her daughter and her grandson were leaving Phoenix for home Monday morning, Kelvin Walker said. ""She's elated to be getting back this soon,"" said Walker, who stayed behind while his family evacuated. The Wallow Fire is the second-largest recorded fire in state history, having burned across a land mass roughly equivalent to an area one and a half times the city of Phoenix. The 2002 Rodeo/Chediski fire, Arizona's largest recorded wildfire, burned more than 731 square miles of eastern Arizona. Fire officials said Sunday that they had turned a corner in stopping the fire, which started as May 29 in the Apache National Forest, according to authorities. Walker said he remained in part to keep an eye on the family's two-acre homestead. However, the main reason he didn't evacuate with his family was because his elderly aunt and uncle refused to budge, and he felt compelled to stay and look after them. ""It was really strange,"" Walker said. ""If you chose to stay rather than evacuate, you had to sign a waiver and say you would not leave your property."" Walker didn't stay home. He ventured out into the ghost town, not to disobey but to help out, he said. He said he took training to become a runner for firefighters on the front lines. Among them is his 26-year-old son, Kyran, who is a seasonal firefighter for the U.S. Forest Service, Walker said. ""He was one of the first responders. He's been working 12 to 16 to 18 hours a day since the fire started,"" Walker said. ""I stayed home and fed him every night. I think he took (the fire) fairly personal."" So did Walker's neighbors. Before evacuation, many left signs in the front yards in support of the firefighters. ""The signs said things like 'We love you. We appreciate you. Be safe!' "" Walker said. On Sunday, according to CNN affiliate KNXV, a flashing sign posted on the road into Springerville read, ""We missed you. Welcome home."" Electricity has been restored to the towns of Nutrioso and part of Alpine, southeast of Greer. More than 100 law enforcement officers are working with the incident to ensure public and firefighter safety, as well as protect residents' property during evacuations, authorities said Monday evening. CNN's Phil Gast and journalist Craig Johnson contributed to this report.","NEW: Light winds Monday night keep smoke at bay .

"(CNN) -- Casey Stoner moved to the top of the MotoGP standings after world champion and previous leader Jorge Lorenzo crashed out in treacherously wet conditions during Sunday's British Grand Prix. The Australian, himself a motorcycling world champion when at Ducati in 2007, continued his fine start to the season with new team Honda Repsol as he went 18 points clear following his fourth win in six races this season. Stoner's teammate Andrea Dovizioso finished second at Silverstone to consolidate third place on 83 points, 15 behind Yamaha's Lorenzo, while veteran American Colin Edwards defied a broken collarbone to claim third place for his first podium this season. ""I was just happy to stay up on the bike, it was incredibly cold and I was so nervous as in these conditions it's so easy to crash,"" Stoner told the MotoGP website. Lorenzo won last year's race but started third on the grid this time after Stoner dominated qualifying, setting the circuit's lap record on Saturday. Stoner underlines dominance with Silverstone pole . The Spaniard started well and took the early lead -- but had surrendered that by the end of the opening lap as Dovizioso and Stoner went past him. Another Honda rider, Marco Simoncelli, also passed the Mallorcan to claim third place but was unable to stay on the track as he slid off during lap 10 in his bid to get past fellow Italian Dovizioso. Lorenzo had already departed the track by that stage, gesturing angrily after he flipped over the front of his bike and slid into the gravel on lap eight. It was the first time he had failed to finish a race since 2009. ""I feel disappointed because the crash was my own mistake. I think I could have fought for the victory with Casey,"" he said. ""I wasn't worried that Simoncelli was catching me. I was worried because Casey was going if I didn't overtake Andrea -- then I crashed."" Stoner, who has now won three races in a row as well as the season-opener in Qatar, finished more than 15 seconds clear of Dovizioso as he was able to lap tailenders Hector Barbera and Randy de Puniet, both on Ducatis. But the Italian team had some good news as former world champion Nicky Hayden finished fourth, setting the fastest lap time of the race, while seven-time series winner Valentino Rossi was sixth to move above the injured Dani Pedrosa into fourth overall. Lorenzo's American teammate Ben Spies also crashed out on lap 14, while Edwards' Monster Yamaha Tech 3 colleague Cal Crutchlow missed his home race after breaking his collarbone on Saturday. The 37-year-old Edwards broke his during practice at the Catalunya Grand Prix, which forced him to miss his first race since moving up from Superbikes in 2003. Meanwhile, Audi won the Le Mans 24 Hour endurance race for the 10th time in 12 years on Sunday, as its sole remaining driving team of Benoit Treluyer, Marcel Fassler and Andre Lotterer triumphed in the 79th staging of the legendary event. They finished 14 seconds ahead of Peugeot's Sebastien Bourdais, Simon Pagenaud and Pedro Lamy after completing a grueling 355 laps. Peugeot, which won in France in 2009 to end five years of German dominance, claimed the other podium place as Stephane Sarrazin, Franck Montagny and Nicolas Minassian finished third. Audi had lost the car of two-time winner Allan McNish inside the first hour on Saturday when the British driver crashed, and defending champion Mike Rockenfeller's hopes ended after a big shunt that evening.","Casey Stoner wins British Grand Prix to go top of MotoGP championship standings .

"(CNN) -- Phillip and Nancy Garrido have started serving sentences in separate California prisons for their roles in the abduction and rape of Jaycee Dugard, the state's corrections department announced Thursday. The married couple held Dugard captive for 18 years. They pleaded guilty to charges of kidnapping and sexual assault in late April. This month a judge sentenced Phillip Garrido to 431 years to life in prison. Nancy Garrido was sentenced to 36 years to life in prison. Authorities received Phillip Garrido on Thursday at California State Prison-Corcoran in Kings County. He will be housed in a protective unit for inmates ""whose safety would be endangered by general population placement,"" the corrections department said in a news release. Nancy Garrido began serving her sentence Wednesday at Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla. Dugard was abducted from the street in front of her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991. She was 11 years old at the time of her kidnapping. Authorities found her in 2009. During those years, the Garridos held Dugard in a hidden compound on their home's grounds in Antioch, California. She bore two daughters, fathered by Phillip Garrido. A statement from Dugard -- now 31 -- read by her mother at the sentencing hearing earlier this month called the Garridos ""evil"" and described her kidnapping by them as a ""sexual perversion.""","Phillip Garrido is serving a sentence of 431 years to life in prison .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russia will lift its grain export ban on July 1 this year, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced Saturday. Putin made the announcement at his country residence during a meeting with Viktor Zubkov, his deputy in charge of agriculture. The meeting was shown on Russian state TV. The temporary ban has been in effect since Aug. 15, 2010, following an unprecedented six-week heat wave and drought that wiped out crops in many farming areas. The 2010 grain harvests amounted to just 60.9 million tons -- a staggering 37% drop from 2009, according to the Russian Agriculture Ministry. Russia -- which had been the world's third-largest wheat exporter -- stopped all exports of wheat, rye, barley and corn, as well as flour, boosting a sharp increase in world grain prices. Despite a late spring, sowing in most regions is going well, and a good harvest is expected this year, Zubkov said. ""We are lifting the grain export ban from July 1 this year, but I am asking you to work most actively, as you did in recent years, and ensure the work of the agriculture ministry, other government departments and financial institutions so as to support our agricultural producers in this difficult period, and the sowing campaign, which is not fully over yet, let alone the harvesting,"" Putin said. ""You should very carefully monitor what is happening in this economic sector that it so important for us and, using all our mechanisms, support agricultural producers,"" Putin told Zubkov. ""The lifting of the export ban is one of the measures to support agricultural producers who today have an export potential,"" Putin said. The government forecast for the 2011 wheat crop has been set at about 85 million tons, and agriculture experts estimate that with the grain export ban lifted, Russia may export 10 to 13 million tons of grain in 2011, mostly wheat.","Russia had poor grain harvests in 2010 .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan faces a no-confidence vote in parliament on Thursday, a major political setback that could cost him his leadership position. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party filed a no-confidence motion Wednesday, and needs a total of 240 votes for it to pass in parliament. It cited his handling of the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and ensuing nuclear crisis as a reason for the motion. Opposition members need 80 votes from Kan's party, the Democratic Party of Japan. So far, at least 50 members of his party say they will vote for the no-confidence motion. If the no-confidence vote passes, Kan would be forced to step down within 10 days. A devastating tsunami struck Japan's Pacific coast after the massive earthquake in March, triggering the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl as the cores of reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant overheated and spewed radioactive chemicals. Kan, who was unpopular before the disaster, has come under fire as the nation battles to contain the nuclear and economic woes. Adding on to the problems, ratings agency Moody's Investors Service placed the country's local and foreign currency bond ratings on review for possible downgrade. Political in-fighting remains a problem in Japan, which has seen six prime ministers in the past five years. Last year, after only a few months in office, his main political opponent within his own party attempted to take control of the Democratic Party of Japan, effectively taking over the premiership. Kan managed to hold onto the title of party leader. Kan's one-year anniversary in office is June 8.

"Ajdabiya, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces battled rebels for the cities of Misrata and Ajdabiya on Wednesday, according to witnesses and CNN staff on the ground. In Ajdabiya, airstrikes, heavy bombardment and fighting between the rebels and pro-Gadhafi forces began after the rebels were able to take control of some positions in the eastern Libyan city overnight. Thousands of government forces eventually gathered outside Ajdabiya with dozens of heavy artillery pieces, radar control weapons systems and about a dozen tanks, CNN's Nic Robertson reported from just outside the city. AK-47s and Katyusha rockets were among the weapons carried by government soldiers, who appeared jubilant and confident about a possible upcoming battle for the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. The troops were carried in white pickups, many of which were covered in dirt for camouflage purposes. Witnesses said pro-Gadhafi snipers were positioned in various parts of the city. Ajdabiya is the last major point between pro-government forces and Benghazi. If it is retaken by pro-Gadhafi forces, it would give access to roads leading to the heart of the opposition's base. In Misrata, west of Ajdabiya, Gadhafi ""is bombing his way into the city,"" witness Mohamed Ali said. ""He doesn't care if all the people (there) are dead by the end of the day."" Ali accused Gadhafi of launching a ""cowardly, murderous attack."" ""People are not safe. It's amazing that this is happening,"" Ali said, adding that two people have been killed and 15 injured, one ""very critically."" He said Gadhafi's forces had not yet been able to get into the city. Ali described described himself as a 46-year-old IT engineer and a member of the local opposition council. He called himself a rebel fighter but said he had no weapons. The rebels are fighting with whatever arms they can capture from government troops, he said, such as Kalashnikov rifles. ""The best we have"" is rocket-propelled grenade launchers, he said. CNN journalists in Libya were not able to reach Misrata to confirm Ali's account. But a second witness also said the city came under sustained attack by forces loyal to Gadhafi on Wednesday. The tank and artillery fire went on for at least two hours, he said. ""We hear very, very, very loud explosions,"" said the witness, who did not want to be named. ""They have cut off electricity and water."" Meanwhile, four New York Times journalists covering the conflict were reported missing by the newspaper Wednesday. Editors said they had received second-hand information that some of the reporting team ""had been swept up by Libyan government forces"" in Ajdabiya. Government forces said they had no information about the missing journalists and said that if they were picked up by the Libyan military, they would have been taken back to Tripoli. Gadhafi's battles to recapture a number of rebel-held towns and cities come on the day the United Nations Security Council considered imposing a no-fly zone over Libya. Wednesday ended with no agreement on a draft resolution, but several diplomats expressed optimism that a vote would come soon. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said late Wednesday that envoys were considering a variety of options to protect civilians in Libya, not just a no-fly zone or a cease fire. Susan Rice said a ""range of actions"" were up for serious discussion, including but not limited to a no-fly zone, which has ""inherent limitations in terms of protection of civilians."" A diplomatic source told CNN that air strikes are among options being discussed as diplomats focus on what should be in a U.N. Security Council resolution. The international community is keenly aware of the urgency and gravity of the situation on ground, Rice continued. She said she hopes to see a serious resolution as early as Thursday. The French Ambassador had earlier confirmed that text for a new draft resolution on Libya had been submitted to diplomats. He also told reporters that he expected a vote on the resolution within 24 hours. Lebanon's U.N. ambassador, Nawaf Salam, said Arab countries are committed to participating in a no-fly zone. That has been an apparent prerequisite for U.S. support of such a zone. The Lebanese diplomat wouldn't detail the level of potential Arab participation but said it would be ""significant"" and said it has ""been confirmed by the highest political authorities."" The French foreign minister said on his blog Wednesday that several Arab countries would be willing to participate in a targeted attack on Gadhafi's air assets. The minister, Alain Juppe, did not specify which countries or how they would participate. Without implementation of a no-fly zone, rebels fear that it is only a matter of time before there is a bloodbath in Benghazi. Libya's deputy ambassador to the U.N. expressed this fear Wednesday. Gadhafi ""has given instructions for ethnic cleansing,"" Ibrahim Dabbashi said, adding that the Libyan leader would commit genocide against rebels if he was not stopped by the international community. Dabbashi said he expects the Security Council to produce a draft resolution soon. ""International consensus is in the process of building,"" Dabbashi said in the Security Council's briefing room. Dabbashi made headlines in February when he joined with Libyan Ambassador to the U.N. Mohamed Shalgham to condemn Gadhafi and request that he step down as Libya's leader. Libya's government has subsequently requested that Dabbashi and Shalgham be denied the right to speak for Libya at the United Nations. Women marched in Benghazi on Wednesday, carrying banners reading, ""how many Libyans must die to get the Security Council to move on."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters Wednesday that opinions in a number of countries initially opposed to the imposition of a no-fly zone shifted after the Arab League announced its support for such a step. ""Intense negotiations"" are underway at the Security Council, she said. ""We are moving as rapidly as we can to get additional authorization."" A council diplomat said Washington was engaged in negotiations on the text. Germany's U.N. ambassador said his country has still questions about such a zone. India's U.N. ambassador asked, ""Who will implement the no-fly zone? Who would provide assets for it?"" China's U.N. ambassador said his country is concerned about deteriorating conditions in Libya but didn't say whether Beijing backs a no-fly measure. Ali, the opposition leader in Misrata, urged China and Russia to ""look in the mirror"" and understand that ""they are hindering the international effort to put this war criminal in his place."" While the Arab League recommendation of a no-fly zone carried some weight with reluctant council nations, another declaration from the league that there should be ""no foreign intervention"" has perplexed delegates. En route to Washington after a weekend trip to Bahrain, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday that the logistical challenges of enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya could be overcome. ""If we are directed to impose a no-fly zone, we have the resources to do it,"" he said. ""The question is whether it's a wise thing to do. And that's the discussion that's going at a political level.""

"(CNN) -- The Monument fire, which has scorched 40 homes in southern Arizona, has quite an arsenal to use against firefighters. At 9,300 acres Thursday, the blaze is roaring in the Huachuca Mountains near the Mexican border, just south of Sierra Vista, Arizona. It is only 17% contained. ""This whole part of the country is in extreme drought,"" said Dale Thompson, a spokesman for fire crews. ""Grass will take off like gasoline."" Red-flag warnings indicated that the region was at the mercy of heat, low humidity and wind gusts up to 35 miles per hour. Evacuations were ordered in some neighborhoods, and other residents were told they may have to leave, local officials said. Portions of a major highway were closed on the edge of the Coronado National Memorial/Coronado National Forest. Meanwhile, crews battled the massive Wallow fire in eastern Arizona on several fronts Thursday as they dealt with strong winds and low relative humidity. The raging blaze started last month in eastern Arizona, devouring hundreds of thousands of acres before spilling into New Mexico. It has grown into the largest fire ever in Arizona, according to fire officials. It had burned 478,016 acres and was 29% contained as of Thursday afternoon, officials said. The National Weather Service issued a wind advisory for the area Thursday, warning of strong and gusty winds in the afternoon and evening. Humidity levels were at 5 to 12 percent, it said. The Wallow fire -- centered in a sparsely populated national forest -- is the largest but not the state's most destructive in terms of property. It has destroyed 32 homes and 36 outbuildings, including sheds and barns, compared with the 468,000-acre Rodeo-Chediski fire, which destroyed 465 homes. On Thursday, firefighters focused on hazard tree removal, structure protection, improving containment lines and conducting mop-up activities, officials said. Authorities have lifted a nearly two-week-long evacuation order for the 200-plus residents of the community of Nutrioso. Officials with an interagency team fighting the blaze lifted the evacuation order issued June 2 for the town, allowing those with identification showing that they live there to return Wednesday. Leighayn Green returned with her husband and their 13-year-old daughter to their undamaged home. They stayed in different communities, at times with friends and once in lodging provided by a stranger. ""There is a kindness being extended back and forth between communities,"" Green said after she returned home.

"(CNN) -- ""Dragon Age II"" isn't exactly a sequel, but it does continue to thrill with new distinctive artwork, a more descriptive speech mechanic and a combat system that feels intuitive and destructive at the same time. Where ""Dragon Age: Origins"" told the tale of a Grey Warden's trek to gather allies, stem the tide of the malevolent Blight (a wave of evil creatures bent on taking over) and do battle against an arch-demon, ""Dragon Age II"" (BioWare, Electronic Arts) showcases another wave of the story. It starts with a family fleeing the Blight. Think of it as a branch off the ""Origins"" story tree to expand the ""Dragon Age"" universe. You play as Hawke -- either a warrior, mage or rogue (player's choice) who is escaping with his mother, sister and brother. The prologue does a great job of teaching combat and movement mechanics, but you also suffer your first tragedy as a family member succumbs to the Blight. This pushes the story away from Hawke's homeland of Ferelden to the City of Chains, Kirkwall. It is there that the adventure begins in earnest, and it serves as your home base for most of the game. Having played ""Origins"" on the PC, I was immediately struck by the new artwork design of some familiar characters. The Darkspawn, which are the grunt element of the Blight, used to look similar to orcs or goblins from ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. Now, they appear to be more skeletal with an almost undead look to them. Mike Laidlaw, creative director for the ""Dragon Age"" series, said the game is character-driven and the team wanted the races to look unique. ""We didn't want to fall in the trap of all of the races to be humans with funny ears,"" he said. ""Ultimately, 'Dragon Age' needs its own distinct look. One of the dangers of fantasy is, there is so much out there that it is easy to lump it all together into an elf/orc mishmash, and we wanted to stand apart."" Laidlaw credits Matthew Goldman, the art director for ""Dragon Age II,"" with bringing a fresh, new look to the races and a desire to make the characters truly unique. ""I think there were elements of 'Origins,' especially in the appearances, that were technical masterpieces,"" Laidlaw explained. ""But Matt felt that they weren't standing out enough. They weren't creating their own space and colonizing their visual identity in the way that he wanted."" The Quanri, a warlike race that originally appeared as large humans, also got a makeover. They retained their size and aggressive appearance, but they also sprouted horns similar to a gazelle or, as Laidlaw points out, an ogre. One of the driving forces in the game is the interaction between the player character and his allies and other non-player characters. Talking between characters is done through a series of choices that allow the player to take different postures in the discussions. The speech choices are now shown with an icon that indicates the tone in which the character will speak. Laidlaw said that in ""Origins,"" a player couldn't tell whether the choices would come out as sarcastic or aggressive and may have chosen a response that they ended up not wanting. ""We wanted a mix of the paraphrase, so you could see what you were going to say, and the statement of intent,"" he said. ""While some of them are just tone, knowing when you are going to be funny is really key, especially when that is one of the principal tones of the game."" There are icons for peaceful/helpful, funny, aggressive, hard, romance and others. I found myself using helpful and funny answers more than others. Laidlaw said the game recognizes those tendencies and adjusts character reactions as the game goes on. ""For example, if you find yourself constantly being a smart-aleck or making jokes, you'll find in combat that your battle cries will change. It does create a consistency of character along those core choices."" Laidlaw explained that it gives gamers a greater sense of control over their characters to shape them the way they want and a create deeper sense of immersion in the game. The game uses a recurring interrogation scene as part of its narrative, a move Laidlaw says is intended to add perspective and depth to character development and movement of the story. Varric, a dwarven crossbow expert and ally of Hawke's, is being questioned by Cassandra, a Templar seeking answers to some unnamed, yet often foreshadowed, tragedy surrounding Hawke. Chapters of the game's story start and finish in the interrogation room, with Varric leading into or wrapping up the action and Cassandra reacting to what she's hearing. It is an interesting technique and gives the game a television series feel, complete with recaps and previews. I almost felt like it was time for a commercial break to raid the fridge. It isn't necessary to have played ""Origins"" to enjoy, and progress in, ""Dragon Age II."" But developers wanted it to retain the first game's history. Players who begin play having already saved a game of ""Origins"" will see differences in certain parts of the story -- from who is on the throne to the political and social situation in other kingdoms. Game play on the Xbox 360 console feels clean and smooth, with very few hiccups or lag. The outdoor environments are colorful and detailed, but the underground caves and caverns start to feel similar, with lots of identical layouts. Combat on the major gaming consoles utilizes two levels of mapable buttons for skills and spells, while a shortcut bar offers more choices on the PC version. Controlling the party's actions seems easier on the PC than the console, but it can be done with some practice. Battles are as visceral and graphic as ever and the ""persistent gore"" setting returns, which makes for some awkward conversations. Trying to pay attention to an important bit of information is made more difficult when you are thinking, ""You've got a bit of ogre on your chin."" The tactics system is carried over from ""Origins,"" allowing you to set up character actions to occur at pre-determined thresholds or events. Characters can be set up to drink a healing potion when their health gets low without any break in the battle or gamer involvement. ""The combat is still tactical, still requires you to think as a team and not just as one character,"" Laidlaw said. There is no ""there's the big bad guy, go get him"" mentality to how the game unfurls. It is an interactive story that allows players to grow their characters organically, from the aspects of both combat and personal development. And it isn't a game if you're just looking for a quick turn on the console or PC. The action occurs over numerous quests, side quests and personal missions that can easily chew up 30-plus hours on a weekend as you try to complete ""just one more quest."" ""I never want to give players all the answers,"" Laidlaw said. ""I think the mystery, the sense that this world is richer and deeper than just one game helps keep it more vital, more vibrant in terms of player experience."" Whether you play as the dashing hero romancing every woman you meet or the hard, rough-and tumble-hero who smashes first and forgets to ask questions later, ""Dragon Age II"" has more than enough action, drama and suspense to keep fans of the fantasy gaming genre pleased. ""Dragon Age II"" comes out on March 8 in North America and March 11 in Europe on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC and Mac.

"Belgrade, Serbia (CNN) -- A medical team in Serbia has determined that war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic is in good enough shape to be extradited to face a war crimes tribunal, a court spokeswoman in Belgrade said Friday. While Mladic suffers from several chronic conditions, the team said there are no immediate problems barring a move. This comes after five doctors examined Mladic Thursday night, said Mladic's lawyer, Milos Saljic. ""The court decided that conditions for extradition have been met,"" court spokeswoman Maya Kovacevic said. The determination was made during a deportation hearing Friday, held to decide whether Mladic will be transferred to the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. Mladic refused to make any statement before the court, but Saljic said the Mladic team will appeal. That appeal could come by Monday. Asked how soon the judge would rule on the appeal, Kovacevic answered, ""immediately."" Mladic's son, Darko, said his father has trouble speaking and his right arm is partially paralyzed. ""We saw him for the first time in many years. He's in bad shape,"" Darko Mladic said to reporters in front of the courthouse. ""His health is very deteriorated."" He said the family is asking the court to send Mladic to a hospital for treatment and analysis and wants Russian doctors to examine him. His father is not guilty of the grave charges against him, insisted Darko Mladic. But Bruno Vekaric, the deputy prosecutor of Serbia's Special Court for War Crimes, dismissed the family's account of Mladic's health as a defense ploy. ""He's like a young man,"" Vekaric said. ""He's not so ill or in a bad situation."" Mladic's right arm seemed to be bothering him, but he was fine Friday, Vekaric said. Mladic refused to read the indictment against him, telling the judge, ""I don't want to read the papers of the tribunal,"" according to Vekaric. An angry Mladic accused Vekaric of being a CIA agent but apologized Friday, the deputy prosecutor said. He asked Vekaric for a few books by Russian authors Leo Tolstoy and Nikolai Gogol. He also made one other request, one that the prosecutor found odd coming from the man once known as the ""Butcher of Bosnia."" ""He asked for strawberries,"" Vekaric said, laughing. Mladic is in a jail near Belgrade facing charges that he presided over Europe's worst massacre since World War II. He was arrested Thursday after more than 15 years in hiding. Mladic was the highest-ranking fugitive to remain at large after the conflicts that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Saljic described Mladic as a ""ruin of a man"" who has suffered two heart attacks and three strokes since 1996. Serbian President Boris Tadic said Serbian authorities are still investigating who aided Mladic during his decade and a half on the run, but he called allegations that the country's military sheltered him ""rubbish."" ""At the end of the day, he was protected by a very small group of people from his family,"" Tadic said. He acknowledged that Mladic may have been aided by military officers early on, ""but at the end of that process, I don't believe that."" The former Yugoslav army officer was the commanding general of Bosnian Serb forces during the 1992-95 war that followed Bosnia-Herzegovina's secession from Yugoslavia. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has charged him with leading a genocidal campaign against Bosnia's Muslim and Croat populations, including ""direct involvement"" in the 1995 killings of nearly 8,000 men and boys in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica -- the worst European massacre since the Holocaust. However, Mladic remains a hero to some Serbs, and small outbursts of anger in reaction to his arrest were seen in Belgrade late Thursday.

"(CNN) -- A jury in Copenhagen City Court on Monday found 25-year-old Chechen Lors Doukaev guilty of attempted terrorism, the court announced. According to the court documents Lors Doukaev intended to send a letter bomb to Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten but accidentally set off the bomb material in Copenhagen Hotel Jorgensen where he was staying last September. The blast destroyed the bathroom and injured Doukaev, who ran into a nearby park. Police surrounded him in the park and the bomb squad detonated a pouch he was wearing. In addition to the conviction for attempted terrorism, he was also found guilty of carrying a pistol. He could be sentenced to up to 16 years in prison. Sentencing will be Tuesday. Doukaev traveled to Denmark on September 7 under false name and booked a room on Hotel Jorgensen under a false name. He said in court that he had a pistol and a bomb for personal security reasons . Jyllands-Posten triggered global protests and controversy in 2005 when it published 12 drawings of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed. The controversy grew in early 2006 when a Norwegian newspaper reprinted the drawings. Islamic law generally bans any depiction of Mohammed.","Lors Doukaev of Chechnya was injured when bomb material detonated in a hotel .

"Washington (CNN) -- Police should have considered a 13-year-old robbery suspect's age when he was questioned without his parents present, a divided Supreme Court ruled Thursday, concluding a child in such a situation would not have reasonably felt free to walk away from the interrogation. The 5-4 decision dealt with whether the unnamed juvenile was entitled to be given a Miranda warning, telling him he need not answer questions. ""It is beyond dispute that children will often feel bound to submit to police questioning when an adult in the same circumstances would feel to free to leave,"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor for the court. ""Seeing no reason for police officers or courts to blind themselves to that commonsense reality, we hold that a child's age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis."" The case was one of several this term dealing with the extent of constitutional rights for minors. ""J.D.B."" was a 13-year-old special-needs public school student in 2005. He was escorted from his seventh-grade class and taken to a conference room. There a Chapel Hill, North Carolina, police investigator -- along with an assistant principal, school resource officer and an intern -- asked the boy if he wanted to talk about some recent criminal activity in the area. The African-American boy agreed to talk. The door was closed but not locked. After first denying any involvement, J.D.B. admitted breaking into several neighborhood homes and stealing items, including a camera. After the confession, the police officer told the boy he did not have to answer further questions, but he continued talking and gave further incriminating statements. The adults testified the youngster never asked to cease the questioning or to leave the room. When the 30- to 45-minute session ended, the boy was allowed to leave and catch his bus for home. Officers later that day obtained a search warrant of his house and found the stolen goods. He was again questioned. At no time were the youth's legal guardian or parents notified, and Miranda rights were never administered. Larceny and juvenile delinquency charges were filed, and courts subsequently allowed the confession to be admitted as evidence, concluding J.D.B. was not in custody and talked voluntarily. The appeal focused on the school interrogation, since the high court has previously ruled underage students are subject to some restrictions on their movements in that setting. The 1966 Supreme Court ruling in Miranda v. Arizona established clear guidelines to protect all criminal suspects from being compelled to give self-incriminating testimony. As seen on countless cop shows on TV, the warnings protect against police coercion, but also establish when a person is ""in custody."" Such factors as location and the length and nature of the interrogation all would be factors. Weighing that, courts must make an objective determination of ""how a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation"" about agreeing to talk. But this case came down to how the ""reasonable man"" objective standard could be applied to a 13-year-old boy. The majority said age is another of many factors that must be considered. ""Officers and judges need no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, training in cognitive science, or expertise in social and cultural anthropology to account for a child's age,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""They simply need the common sense to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult."" Sotomayor and the justices ordered the state court to take another look at whether the boy was in custody, and to decide that question by taking into account the ""relevant circumstances"" of the interrogation that Sotomayor articulated. She was supported by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan. In dissent, Justice Samuel Alito accused the majority of injecting ""personal characteristics"" and a ""reality-based approach"" to Miranda that will lead to that legal standard continually shifting. ""If Miranda's rigid, one-size-fits-all standards fail to account for the unique needs of juveniles, the response should be to rigorously apply the constitutional rule against coercion to ensure that the rights of minors are protected. There is no need to run Miranda off the rails,"" Alito wrote. ""Bit by bit, Miranda will lose the clarity and ease of application that has long been viewed as one of its chief justifications."" He was backed by Chief Justice John Roberts and conservative colleagues Justice Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The case is J.D.B. v. North Carolina (09-11121). .","A 13-year-old suspect was questioned by a police officer at school .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN)  -- Berlin, Germany, mixes the old and the new, the west and the east with creativity and culture. Once the center of attention for a worldwide controversy (remember the Berlin Wall?), it's now an increasingly popular European destination. The city is made up of 23 distinct, character-filled districts and is home to the Reichstag, the Berliner Dome and the Brandenburg Gate. But it's the areas outside the typical tourist locations that offer the real flavor of the capital. CNN International reporter Frederik Pleitgen has lived in Berlin since 2000. He shares his favorite city spots in this CNN Insider Trip Tips: . What's the biggest misconception about your city? That it must be a really expensive place. In fact, there are very few cities that offer more quality of life for very little money. How do tourists stick out, and what's the best way to blend in? Grungy clothes usually help to blend in. Looking too smart is usually a mistake. Dress down to blend in. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? Hartmanns in downtown Kreuzberg has lovely food at affordable prices and a lovely atmosphere. Where do you go to relax? Café am Neuen See, a beer garden in the Tiergarten (Berlin's Central Park) with a lovely lake in the middle. If you want to work out after having a cold beer, you can rent a rowboat. Travel Snapshots: Berlin . Where is the best place to people-watch? The cafes in Prenzlauer Berg near the Kollwitzplatz are wonderful places to watch people in the summer. Where can you get the best view of the city? The top of the broadcast tower in central Berlin offers a beautiful view of the city, but the Dome in the Reichstag is also wonderful. What is your favorite neighborhood? Why? My favorite neighborhood is Charlottenburg around the Kurfuerstendamm because it offers big city flair and yet is laid-back and easygoing. What essential thing should visitors see/experience if they only have a few hours? Walk through the Brandenburg Gate! What's the biggest tourist trap? Is there a ""tourist trap"" that's actually worth seeing? The tourist trap worth seeing is the Reichstag, which always has really long lines to queue up, but inside you can see the entire history of Europe in the 20th century. From graffiti the Russian soldiers left when they moved into Berlin at the end of World War II to the great modern architecture of the unified Germany that was built into the shell of the old Reichstag. Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town? Panorama, located in Berghain, is one of the coolest clubs in the world. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? Currywurst from the restaurant Curry 36 -- though that is not everybody's thing.

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton's weeklong trip to sub-Saharan Africa takes her to a continent hungry for economic growth and political accountability but still shackled by poverty and government corruption. The U.S. secretary of state will see the effects of that poverty close-up: . -- In Tanzania, she'll meet with women who are victims of gender-based violence. -- In Ethiopia, she'll visit a hospital where women are suffering from fistula, their internal organs scarred. They've been abandoned by their husbands and ostracized by their communities. She also will see initiatives designed to improve Africans' lives, such as programs providing mothers and children with nutritional food for the critical 1,000-day period from the start of a woman's pregnancy until her child's second birthday. At her first stop Friday in Lusaka, Zambia, Clinton will speak to the 2011 U.S.-Sub-Saharan Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum, the centerpiece of the United States government's trade policy with sub-Saharan Africa. It gives trade preferences to countries of the region that meet criteria on economic, legal and human rights issues. Eligible countries can export nearly 6,500 products -- including apparel, automobiles, footwear and fruit -- duty-free to the U.S. At the forum, government officials, business leaders and civil activists from African countries and the United States will discuss trade, business and investment opportunities in Africa. Clinton will meet with participants in the African Women's Entrepreneurship Program, an outreach, education and engagement initiative that aims to give African women entrepreneurs the tools to fight for change in their communities. ""People in Africa are very hopeful,"" says Melvin Ayogu, fellow at the Brookings Institution's Africa Growth Initiative, but when they look at their governments ""they often see the politics of impoverishing people to stay in power."" In Zambia, Tanzania and Ethiopia, Clinton will meet with government officials, stressing U.S. goals of fostering good governance and protection of human rights. In strategically located Zambia, Clinton will meet with President Rupiah Bwezani Banda, but she also will confer with opposition presidential candidates Michael Sata and Hakainde Hichilema. In Tanzania, she heads for the State House and a meeting with President Jakaya Kikwete then flies to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for a speech to the African Union. One of her last events on her trip will highlight a priority issue for Clinton: cookstoves. As the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves notes, cooking is one of the most dangerous activities for a woman in many developing countries. Nearly three billion people use traditional cookstoves that burn wood and create smoke that causes almost 2 million premature deaths annually -- more than twice the number from malaria, according to the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. Breathing in toxic fumes, women and children develop pneumonia, emphysema, cataracts, lung cancer and other illnesses. At a Peace Corps building in Addis Ababa, Clinton will meet with local women who make money selling new, clean cookstoves. ""The next time you sit down with your own family to eat, please take a moment to imagine the smell of smoke, feel it in your lungs, see the soot building up on the walls,"" Clinton said in September of 2010. New, clean cookstoves, she said, can save millions of lives. ""The benefits from this initiative,"" she said, ""will be cleaner and safer homes, and that will, in turn, ripple out for healthier families, stronger communities, and more stable societies.""","U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will visit Zambia, Tanzania, Ethiopia .

"(CNN) -- A female sports reporter blasted the all-male Augusta National Golf Club on Monday, a day after a security guard wouldn't let her in to interview one of the stars of the recent Masters tournament. Tara Sullivan, a reporter with The Bergen (New Jersey) Record, tried to join other reporters Sunday evening in the club's locker room to interview Rory McElroy, a 21-year-old from Northern Ireland who gave up a big lead at the close of the four-day competition. But a security guard said she couldn't come in because she was a woman.  Read more about the Masters winner on Golf.com. ""This is not an issue of sensitivity. This is just an issue of doing my job,"" Sullivan said Monday. ""I'm a credentialed reporter. I should have been allowed in."" On Monday, an official with the Augusta, Georgia, golf club explained that the guard had acted in error -- saying that, even though there are no female members in the club, female reporters have been and should be given the same access as men to do their jobs. ""It should not have happened,"" said Steve Ethun, Augusta National's communications director, noting that the guard was not aware of the club's policies. ""We will work as hard as we can to make sure it does not happen again."" The security guard, who was also female, ""was very apologetic"" in denying her access to the locker room in the clubhouse, according to Sullivan. Sullivan responded by citing federal law that mandates equal access for reporters to get into such locker rooms, whatever their gender. ""(The guard) said it's sort of this open bathroom area,"" the reporter said. ""I said, 'Yeah, like every professional locker room I go into.' "" Male reporters, including Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles Times, who did get into the locker room, afterward gave Sullivan transcripts of the interview with McElroy. The Masters, one of professional golf's four ""major"" tournaments, was won by Charl Schwartzel. Sullivan said she was mostly focused on finishing her newspaper column when she sought to enter the locker room. She became the story only after she wrote on her Twitter feed: ""Bad enough no women members at Augusta. But not allowing me to join writers in locker room interview is just wrong."" Years ago, it was that former fact -- that the elite golf club allows only men as members -- that came under the spotlight. In 2002, women's rights activist Martha Burk began a movement aimed at forcing the prestigious club, which includes many titans of finance and industry as members, to open its ranks to women. But the club's then-chairman, Hootie Johnson, resisted these efforts, including saying in a statement that no policy changes would come ""at the point of a bayonet."" As to her situation, Sullivan said she accepts the apology from Augusta National officials. Still, the reporter said that the club -- and not necessarily the security guard herself -- deserves blame for what transpired. ""It's (the club's) responsibility that the tournament security week personnel ... are informed of what the policies are,"" said Sullivan, who vowed to be back at Augusta National to cover her fifth Masters next spring. ""It was just such a complete lack of awareness, which is inexcusable on the part of the people who run the tournament."" CNN's David Wilke contributed to this report.","A security guard didn't let Tara Sullivan into the Masters locker room for an interview .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- With expectations of change running high, former bad-boy pop star Michel Martelly was sworn in Saturday as the president of impoverished Haiti, still reeling from last year's devastating earthquake. In a sign of the nation's troubles, the electricity went out moments before the inauguration, prompting formally dressed dignitaries and guests -- including former U.S. President Bill Clinton and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe -- to fan themselves to stave off rising May heat. Immediately, Twitter lit up with posts calling the blackout a ""bad sign."" Despite the outage, the ceremony proceeded before parliament and Martelly took his oath of office amid the lights of media cameras. Martelly, savvy in social media, tweeted his own inauguration as Haiti's 56th president minutes after it happened along with a flurry of messages expressing hope that change would now come to Haiti. Outside, thousands of Haitians rejoiced at what they see as a new start for their country, where many people remain displaced from their homes and post-quake reconstruction has been slow, one of the reasons popular discontent with the former administration had grown. The collective joy surfaced in a nation that has been subjected to months of misery compounded by a cholera epidemic that erupted last October. Port-au-Prince was under strict security all day Saturday, with United Nations peacekeepers out in force on street corners. ""Today is a big day for us,"" said Jolina Desroches, 40. ""Before, (Martelly) was just the president of Kompa (a Haitian musical genre). Today, he is the president of the Haitian people."" Dressed in a dark suit and red tie, Martelly stepped outside after the ceremony draped in the presidential sash. Supporters hoping for a glimpse of the new president climbed up flag polls over the United Nations plaza where the ceremony took place and pressed against barriers, as vendors took advantage of the crowd to sell plantain chips and bananas. After attending a lengthy Roman Catholic Mass in his honor, Martelly made his first speech as president on Saturday afternoon from a temporary stage in front of the collapsed National Palace, an iconic symbol of Haiti's struggles. He promised change, emphasizing the need to improve public safety to facilitate investment -- saying that, ""with insecurity, the country cannot work. ... Money cannot (stay in the system), which means there isn't work and the misery is worse."" The new president also reaffirmed his campaign promise to offer free education to young Haitians. The entire address was in Creole, except for one part seemingly aimed at encouraging the international community to come to and invest in the Caribbean nation: ""A new Haiti (is) open for business now!"" Thousands who had gathered outside the palace gates -- where a massive tent city still fills the capital's central plaza, as it has since the epic earthquake -- cheered the president's remarks. Martelly has acknowledged his task as herculean in nature. He has pledged to fight corruption and institute measures of transparency. He told CNN last month that one of his first actions as president would be to nominate high court judges. Creating an independent judiciary will send an important signal, he said. ""We have to establish a rule of law,"" he said. ""We want justice for everyone."" Martelly also vowed to end government corruption that has plagued Haiti for years. ""I am excited to take command and make the right decisions for my country,"" he said during a visit to Washington in April. In a message posted on Twitter after the inauguration, the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said it was looking forward to working with the new government to achieve a better future for Haitian people. Martelly's candidacy was unexpected -- he was better known as Sweet Micky, the kompa singer with flamboyant stage presence, but appealed to voters who had grown weary with the status quo. CNN's Moni Basu and Gary Tuchman and journalist Allyn Gaestel contributed to this report.","NEW: Michel Martelly proclaims: ""A new Haiti (is) open for business now!""

"(CNN) -- Nearly two weeks after the biggest wildfire in Arizona history swept through their community and obliterated dozens of homes, barns, sheds and one truck, residents of the tiny town of Greer are back in their homes. Greer residents were ordered to evacuate on June 6, two days before the Wallow Fire blew through their town of about 200 inhabitants and scorched at least 22 homes and 24 outbuildings.  Residents with proper identification were allowed to return Monday. Greer will be open to non-residents Tuesday, according to the Southwest Incident Management Team, which is leading the effort to battle the blaze. The lifting of the evacuation order comes as firefighters increasingly gain the upper hand on the blaze, which has torched more than a half-million acres in eastern Arizona. Firefighters announced late Monday that the blaze is now 56% contained. Meanwhile, weather conditions are expected to improve with calmer winds and higher humidity levels Tuesday, making it easier for crews to battle other active wildfires burning across the state. Over the weekend and on Monday, the flames appeared to outpace firefighters' efforts in some areas. That includes the Monument Fire in southern Arizona, which U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell has deemed the nation's No. 1 priority. Winds in the southern part of the state on Tuesday will be blowing between 5 mph and 10 mph, considerably slower than the 30-plus mph winds that hampered firefighting efforts over the weekend, the National Weather Service forecast. Nationwide, wildfires have burned almost as many acres in the first half of 2011 as were recorded by the National Interagency Fire Center for all of last year. The agency website reports 3.1 million acres in the United States had been ignited by wildfires as of May 31, compared with 3.2 million burned acres cited in the organization's year-end report in November 2010.

Gabor was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center Tuesday afternoon because the feeding tube inserted into her stomach was ""bleeding ... like a fountain,"" her spokesman said. She had been released from the same hospital a day earlier after being treated for pneumonia. Doctors were working hard on her Wednesday afternoon, von Anhalt said. ""She doesn't respond,"" Prince Frederic von Anhalt said. He said she is suffering from a stomach infection. Gabor, 94, has been in and out of the hospital many times in the past year. She underwent hip replacement surgery last summer and a leg amputation several months later. She has been unable to walk since a 2002 car accident. The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is famous for her many marriages and strong personality. Her more prominent films include John Huston's Toulouse-Lautrec biopic ""Moulin Rouge"" in 1952, ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953, ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 cult classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","Gabor ""got into a little coma"" early Wednesday, her husband says .

"(CNN) -- If you prefer your prose pulpy, hard-boiled as a country egg and darker than a midnight shade of noire, then you may be ready for some ""Fun & Games."" The new page-turner from modern pulp master Duane Swierczynski (pronounced sweer-ZIN-ski) hits bookstores Tuesday. Swierczynski is the author of several acclaimed crime thrillers, a regular contributor to Marvel Comics and has collaborated with Anthony E. Zuiker, the Hollywood mastermind behind TV's ""CSI"" on the series of best-selling, Level 26 ""digi-novels."" His book reads like a Quentin Tarantino movie on speed, full of high-octane action, flying by at a breakneck pace, not for the faint of heart, but also with plenty of humor. ""Fun & Games"" is the first book in a trilogy, about an unkillable ex-cop with a checkered past and a B-movie actress with a deadly secret. This pair of misfits is thrown together then hunted by a small army of mysterious hit men dubbed ""the accident people."" While Swierczynski hails from Philadelphia, this book is set in Hollywood and takes advantage of a sunny locale loaded with shady people. The story starts with a white-knuckle car chase through the Hollywood Hills, grabs readers by the scruff of the neck and refuses to let go for the next 304 pages. CNN talked to the author last week. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What led you to start a trilogy? Swierczynski: ""Fun & Games"" is about an alcoholic house sitter who, one sunny California morning, finds himself squared off against the most lethal killers in the world. It's kind of a blend of ""Home Alone"" and ""Die Hard."" The only reason that it's a trilogy is because I couldn't quite kill off the house sitter, Charlie Hardie, in one book. (He dies in the opening pages of the sequel, ""Hell & Gone."") OK, I'm kidding about that. (Or am I? Hmmm ... ) When I originally pitched my editor, John Schoenfelder, I had a one-shot thriller in mind, but he asked if there was a way to build it into a bigger story. That's the sick genius of Schoenfelder; whatever you're thinking, he's thinking BIGGER. It's inspiring, in a demented sort of way. CNN: Who are ""the accident people""? Swierczynski: I love books and movies about hit men. It just strikes me as the ideal job -- you set your own hours, you bring your own gear, you accept only the work you want. When I thought about the perfect hit team, it occurred to me that maybe they would have had experience in a different, yet related, field. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll stop there ... but there's a specific reason these guys operate out of L.A. CNN: Your novels have been described as high octane, brutal and smart but also with a sense of humor, sound accurate? Swierczynski: Whoever said that is very kind, and I owe them money. But that's certainly the target I'm aiming for. If someone closes one of my novels before finishing, I consider it a failure. So I'm doing everything in my power to keep those pages turning -- even if I have to resort to fireworks and tap-dancing. CNN: What led to your website, ""Secret Dead Blog?"" Swierczynski: My love of noir and pulp grew right out of my teenage love of horror fiction (which I still love). The best genre thrillers show people pushed to their extremes, and it's fascinating to watch how characters deal with those extremes. Secret Dead Blog started as a way to share cool stuff with friends, then turned into a place where I can hang with readers and show them cool stuff. I don't update it as often as I like; Twitter often robs me of my urge to blog. CNN: You've also recently been involved in digi-novels and an e-story tie in to the ""L.A. Noire"" video game. Will we see more of that? Swierczynski: Absolutely. I'll always be a sucker for new, shiny toys. I don't want to write the same book endlessly and then die; I'd rather be known as the guy who tried as many different formats and subgenres as possible. Even if some of those efforts are disasters. CNN: Philadelphia features prominently in much of your writing, but ""Fun & Games"" switches coasts. Swierczynski: Well, for better or worse, Philly is where my imagination goes to play. The more I travel, though, the more my imagination likes to hang out in other cities. This is how the L.A.-set ""Fun & Games"" came about; the story just refused to take place anywhere else. CNN: What's on your summer reading list? Swierczynski: Such a great question, because I leave for a cross-country book tour/road trip in a few weeks, and I've been obsessing about which books to pack. Some of the definites: . -- ""The Big Book of Adventure Stories,"" edited by Otto Penzler . -- ""Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead,"" by Sara Gran . -- ""The End of Everything,"" by Megan Abbott . -- ""The Pack,"" by Jason Starr . -- ""You're Next,"" by Gregg Hurwitz . -- ""The Damned Highway,"" by Brian Keene and Nick Mamatas . And a pile of comics and magazines and road atlases and travel guides. Of course, the joy of being on the road is the opportunity to pick up more books from many fine idea shops across the country. I may have to ship my children home separately to make room for more books. CNN: What's next? Swierczynski: My first issue of ""Birds of Prey,"" for DC Comics, will appear this September -- which is part of the companywide relaunch of every single title (all with new No.1 issues). If you're not familiar with the Birds, they're an all-female covert ops team who operates out of Batman's Gotham City. (I'm giddy just typing that.) October brings ""Hell & Gone,"" the sequel to ""Fun & Games."" And then in late December: ""Dark Revelations,"" my third Level 26 thriller with Anthony E. Zuiker. It's been kind of a crazy year, now that I think about it ...","Author Duane Swierczynski talks to CNN about his new thriller, ""Fun & Games""

"(CNN) -- ""Jackass"" star Ryan Dunn and a passenger in his car died of ""blunt and thermal trauma"" when the 2007 Porsche 911 GT3 crashed and caught fire on a Pennsylvania highway early Monday, according to the autopsy report released Tuesday. Police identified Ryan's passenger as Zachary Hartwell, a 30-year-old West Chester, Pennsylvania, man who once worked in one of Ryan's movies. West Goshen, Pennsylvania, Police Sgt. Joe Burt confirmed that accident investigators estimated Dunn's car was going faster than 100 mph. Toxicology results, which should show if Dunn was intoxicated, will not be available for several weeks, according to the Chester County coroner's office. The red-bearded Dunn, 34, was famous for his pranks and dangerous stunts on the show, which evolved into a successful film franchise. Hartwell worked as a stunt car driver on ""Minghads,"" a 2009 comedy directed by ""Jackass"" star Bam Margera and featuring Dunn, according to the Internet Movie Database. West Goshen, Police were called to the wreck scene on State Route 322 at 2:30 a.m. Monday, the police report said. ""Upon arrival, police located one vehicle off the road and in the woods that was fully engulfed in flames,"" the report said. ""Speed may have been a contributing factor to the accident,"" police said, although the investigation is in its preliminary stages. Dunn was driving the Porsche, which was registered in his name, police said. A photo of Dunn was posted on his Twitter account about two hours before the wreck showing him with a drink in his hand.  Two men sitting with Dunn in the photo are not identified. The manager of Barnaby's in West Chester confirmed that the photo was taken in his bar Sunday night.  The bar is about a mile away from where Dunn was killed in a car crash. Manager Jim O'Brien confirmed that Dunn was drinking there. ""He didn't seem to be intoxicated at the time he left,"" O'Brien said.  ""Ryan was not a hardcore drinker, at least not when he was here."" O'Brien said Dunn was a regular customer and well known to his staff. ""He was a valuable person in our community and his death is a tragedy,"" O'Brien said.  ""He will be missed."" MTV issued a short statement through its Twitter account Monday morning:  ""We're deeply saddened by the passing of a member of the MTV family, Ryan Dunn. Our hearts and thoughts are with his friends and family."" ""Jackass"" star Johnny Knoxville tweeted his message Monday morning: ""Today I lost my brother Ryan Dunn. My heart goes out to his family and his beloved Angie. RIP Ryan, I love you buddy."" Dunn teamed up with ""Jackass"" co-star Steve-O for an episode of the NBC game show ""Minute to Win It"" that aired on June 8. He also hosted ""Proving Ground,"" which premiered on the G4 channel on June 14.","NEW: Dunn's car was going faster than 100 mph, police say .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Engineers will need six to nine months to bring the damaged nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant to heel, the plant's owners said Sunday in their first public timetable for ending the crisis. It will take three months to reduce the levels of radioactivity in the plant and restore normal cooling systems in the reactors and spent fuel pools, the Tokyo Electric Power Company announced. Another three to six months will be needed before the reactors are fully shut down and new shells are built around their damaged housings, the company said. Meanwhile, Japan's government said it would try to decontaminate ""the widest possible area"" in that period before deciding  whether the tens of thousands who have been forced to flee their homes will be allowed to return, said Goshi Hosono, an adviser to Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan. ""We have to go step by step in order to resolve the problems one by one,"" Hosono said. The timetable was released five days after Kan called for Tokyo Electric to show Japanese a pathway to ending the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. A day earlier, the company would not comment on an industry group's estimate that restoring normal cooling would take two to three months -- a period comparable to the first stage of Sunday's plan. Tokyo Electric spokesman Hiro Hasegawa acknowledged that public pressure helped speed the company's decision to release a plan and warned that the outline remained tentative -- ""but we will do our best"" to stick to it, he said. Because of the still-unknown volume of highly irradiated water flooding the basements of units 1-3, where the cooling equipment is normally housed, the utility is working toward building a separate cooling system. That system would remove heat from the water being pumped through the reactors and decontaminate it before circulating it back through them. Currently, engineers have improvised by pumping roughly 170 metric tons (45,000 gallons) of water a day into each reactor, an unknown portion of which is leaking out. The leaking water comes out full of such particles as radioactive iodine and cesium, the byproducts of the reactors. At the plant on Sunday, workers used remote-controlled robots to record radiation, water and temperature data in the building that houses reactor No. 3. Photos released by the utility showed the devices, provided by the U.S. company iRobot, opening the inner door to the reactor and entering the darkened building. ""Everything is a high-radiation area inside the reactor buildings,"" Hasegawa told reporters at a briefing for international news outlets -- another first for a company that has been sharply criticized for its handling of the crisis. Meanwhile, Tokyo Electric Chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata fended off nearly a dozen questions from Japanese reporters about whether he or other top executives planned to resign as a result of the disaster. ""At this point, we do not have any decisions or discussions about resigning, as all our efforts is towards resolving the situation,"" Katsumata said. ""We are not sure if resigning is the best way to take the responsibility or to stay in position to resolve the situation."" Any decisions may wait until the company's general shareholders meeting in June, he said. The 5-week-old crisis began March 11, when the plant was swamped by the tsunami that followed northern Japan's historic earthquake. The 14- to 15-meter (45- to 48-foot) wave knocked out the plant's coolant systems, causing the three reactors operating at the time to overheat. The results included two spectacular explosions that blew apart the housings of the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors and the release of a massive amount of radioactivity that has shrunk considerably, but continued Sunday. The wild card in the utility's plan may be reactor No. 2, where another suspected buildup of hydrogen is believed to have ruptured the suppression pool -- a doughnut-shaped reservoir at the base of the reactor. That may make it more difficult to carry out one of the first stages of their planned cooling process, filling the concrete primary containment shell around the reactor pressure vessel with water, Hasegawa said. Unless that damage is repaired somehow, that part of the plan may be unsuccessful, he said. Tokyo Electric also plans to build a new structure to support the No. 4 unit's spent nuclear fuel pool, around which fires -- the cause of which has yet to be determined -- severely damaged a nearby building. Hosono said there is no indication this pool is compromised or leaking highly radioactive water or fumes, calling the planned structure a protective measure given concerns about considerable damage to the main No. 4 nuclear reactor building. Japan's government declared Fukushima Daiichi a top-scale nuclear disaster last week, warning residents of several towns outside the current 30-kilometer (19-mile)  danger zone around the plant to evacuate or prepare to leave their homes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano visited the stricken area Sunday, including a brief trip into the 20-kilometer radius from which all residents have been ordered out. Clad in a white protective suit and face mask, Edano got within about 15 kilometers of the plant as he met with police who are still searching the area for victims of the March disaster. ""Ensuring people's livelihoods and security is our foremost priority,"" Edano said after meeting with the governor of Fukushima Prefecture, Yuhei Sato. Radiation levels in the area are not high enough to cause immediate health effects, but prolonged exposure could cause an increased risk of cancer, according to government data and reports from outside researchers. In Iitate, a village Edano visited Sunday, government figures released Sunday show cumulative doses of radiation since the accident are already more than half the 20-millisievert limit the government . set for long-term evacuations. Iitate is about 40 kilometers northwest of the plant, outside the danger zones drawn in the early days of the crisis. Hosono said the government does not yet know how much of the contaminated areas can be cleaned up, but added, ""We will try to decontaminate as much of an area as possible."" Workers stopped a severe leak of contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean on April 6, but elevated levels of the short-lived nuclear waste iodine-131 recorded over the weekend could indicate a new problem, a Japanese safety official announced Saturday. Iodine concentrations sampled Saturday around the No. 2 water intake were 6,000 times Japan's legal standards, up from 1,100 times on Thursday and down slightly from Friday's figure of 6,500 times. That number is far below the levels recorded when the earlier leak was spewing radioactive iodine into the ocean at 7.5 million times the limit. Authorities have built a silt and placed steel plates around the intake fence to corral the contamination since April 6. Iodine-131 has a radioactive half-life of eight days, and the increase could be either from a fresh leak or from sediment stirred up while placing steel panels around the intakes, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, the top spokesman for Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. ""They will continue to monitor this carefully,"" Nishiyama said. ""At this point, they have not visually found any leakage of any water into the ocean, and it is hard to check the conditions around (reactor) No. 2 due to high radiation levels.""

"(CNN) -- War criminal John Demjanjuk has been released after voluntarily spending time in prison while German prison officials found a nursing home able to take him on short notice, the officials said Friday. Demjanjuk had been freed pending an appeal after being convicted Thursday in the murder of tens of thousands of Jews at a Nazi concentration camp, capping a 30-year legal saga. ""He came back to our prison voluntarily yesterday even though he was a free man"" during the appeal, said Michael Stumpf, the director of the Stadelheim prison in Munich. The regional court in Munich found Demjanjuk guilty of assisting in mass murder as a guard at the Sobibor death camp in Poland. The 91-year-old Ukraine native was sentenced to five years in prison, but was allowed to remain free pending appeal due to age and a lack of flight risk. ""The guards knew exactly what would happen to the people arriving at the camp, from everyday abuse to gruesome murders,"" the court said in announcing the verdict. Duties rotated around the camp, ""so that every single guard would be involved in all parts of the process,"" it said. Demjanjuk's defense argued that he was a prisoner of war who was forced to do what the Nazis wanted. But the court rejected that claim, concluding that Demjanjuk could have fled ""despite a certain degree of risk for himself."" The Nazis and their sympathizers killed at least 167,000 people at Sobibor in 1942 and 1943, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Munich state prosecutors charged Demjanjuk as an accessory to about 27,900 of those deaths, and the court found the killings were ""motivated by racial hatred."" Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of six years in what is likely the last major Nazi war crimes trial in Germany. Jewish groups hailed the verdict soon after it was announced. Israel's Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem, said the trial and ruling show there is no statute of limitations for the crimes of the Holocaust. The accusations against Demjanjuk date to the late 1970s, when the U.S. Justice Department accused him of being a Nazi guard known as ""Ivan the Terrible."" His U.S. citizenship was revoked in 1981, and he was extradited to Israel in 1986. He was convicted in an Israeli court in 1988 and sentenced to death, but that conviction was overturned in 1993 amid evidence that someone else was ""Ivan the Terrible."" A U.S. federal court restored Demjanjuk's citizenship, ruling that the government withheld evidence supporting his case. But the onetime Ohio auto worker's citizenship was revoked again in 2002 after a federal judge ruled that his 1952 entry into the United States was illegal because he hid his past as a Nazi guard. CNN's Roman Lehberger contributed to this report.","He was convicted Thursday in the murder of tens of thousands of Jews .

"(CNN) -- South American soccer stars Kaka and Carlos Tevez have indicated they will stay at their respective clubs despite being linked with big-money moves in the European close-season. Brazil star Kaka has reportedly again been targeted by Tevez's English side Manchester City, who wanted the former world player of the year before he moved to Spain from AC Milan in 2009. And Tevez was expected to leave City, having asked for a transfer in January after citing his unhappiness at being so far away from his young family in their native Argentina. Kaka has struggled to make an impact at the Santiago Bernabeu since his $92 million transfer, and missed the first four months of this season with a knee injury. Newspaper reports have linked City, Milan and Chelsea -- whose manager Carlo Ancelotti was his coach at the San Siro -- with a potential bid for the 29-year-old, but he insists he wants to stay in Madrid. ""I want to stay at Real Madrid and I want to play for Real Madrid,"" he said at a boot launch in quotes reported by the UK Press Association. ""My mother is coming to live in London next year. She is a preacher and she is coming to talk about God. But I have a challenge with Real Madrid. I don't want to think now about playing in the Premier League or going back to Italy. ""I want to get back in good shape and play for Real Madrid next season. I have a good relationship with Carlo but the truth is that I want to stay in Madrid, I want to play in Madrid and I want to live in Madrid."" Tevez had been linked with a move to Spain or Italy, but his manager Roberto Mancini said the striker had indicated he was happy to stay in Manchester after helping City qualify for the Champions League next season and end a 35-year wait for a trophy by winning the FA Cup on Saturday. ""I spoke with him many times in the last 20 days,"" Mancini told reporters after his captain scored twice in Tuesday's 3-0 win over Stoke which lifted City above Arsenal into third place ahead of the final round. ""He has a five-year contract and he has told us he wants to stay. In December he had a problem but everyone can change his opinion. I don't know what his representatives think. ""Carlos is an important player here. The feeling for him is good. Nowhere else can he find behavior that all people have for him."" However, Mancini's comments came after Tevez had cast more doubt over his future following Saturday's 1-0 win over the same opposition at London's Wembley Stadium. ""I want to make it clear that I don't have any problem with Roberto Mancini, despite what people have written and said to the contrary,"" the 25-year-old said. ""But I need to sit down with my family, because we need to make this decision together. I repeat, there is no problem with Mancini. It is a family thing. But really, I haven't made a decision yet.""","Brazil midfielder Kaka says he is happy to stay at Spanish club Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- A 7-year old Michigan boy took a 20-mile drive in his stepfather's car, ending in a high-speed chase with local law enforcement, according to the Huron County Sheriff's office. Around 10 a.m. Monday, 911 dispatchers received multiple calls reporting what appeared to be a young child driving a red Pontiac across town. ""Uh, yes, I'm on Kinde Road outside of Caseville, and believe it or not, I just passed about a 5-, 6-year-old kid flying down the road with a red Pontiac Sunbird,"" one caller told the dispatcher as he tried to follow the speeding car. Eventually, the caller lost sight of the boy. According to Huron County Sheriff Kelly J. Hanson, the car was seen again minutes later in Caseville by another man who called 911. It was racing past a Dairy Queen restaurant. Based on details provided by 911 dispatchers, Huron County Sheriff's Deputy Randy Britt and Caseville Police Chief Jamie Learman began searching for the car. Hanson said Britt and Learman caught up to the young driver and attempted to stop the car, which officials said was driven as fast as 50 mph. The boy appeared to have difficulty pulling over and footage from Britt's dashboard camera shows the officers eventually had to box the car in to slow it down. According to Hanson, though stopped, the car was still running and in gear. The boy was upset, he said, and couldn't unlock the car door. Finally, officers were able to calm the child and get the door open. Britt put the vehicle in park. ""It was learned that the child had left his residence in his stepfather's vehicle, which is in the Sheridan Township area. He was heading for his father's residence in the Filion area,"" said Hanson. ""Deputy Britt called the child's mother and got her voicemail. She quickly returned the call and was unaware that her son was missing. Apparently, she had worked a night shift and had left instructions with the boy to be awakened at 10:00 a.m."" A deputy brought the mother to the car and her frightened son, where deputies arranged for them to go to the county Department of Human Services. ""We're waiting to hear back from DHS to see how to proceed if we need to, if there is any trouble in the home, any neglect,"" Hanson said. ""We won't release the parents' names until DHS has decided what to do, so we don't interfere with possible court proceedings."" No charges have been filed against the boy or his mother.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of firefighters battling to control dangerous wildfires in Arizona will get a small measure of relief this week as winds calm and humidity levels rise, the National Weather Service said Monday. Critical conditions are forecast Monday across large sections of New Mexico and Texas, and to a lesser extent in Oklahoma and Kansas. On Sunday, critical to extreme conditions could be found in those four states, plus Arizona, Colorado, Utah and Nevada. Arizona bore the brunt of Sunday's fiery conflagration as flames outpaced firefighters' efforts. The Monument Fire -- which U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell has deemed the nation's No. 1 priority, putting it first in line for any air, ground or other resources -- jumped Highway 92 late Sunday afternoon at Carr Canyon heading east, according to the Cochise County website. ""We've had a hard day today, with things that we didn't want to happen,"" fire spokesman Bill Paxton said Sunday night. ""The bull came out of the pen."" Thanks to dry, windy conditions, the fire broke through four contingency lines, including going over to the other side of the highway, said Paxton, part of the national Interagency Incident Management Team. ""Everything aligned for a massive push,"" he said. ""It's really hard on the community here."" The Cochise County Sheriff's Office broadened the evacuation zone east to the San Pedro River, reports InciWeb, an online interagency database that tracks fires, floods and other disasters. On Sunday evening, the website noted the fire had burned at least 26,956 acres and was 27% contained. More than 1,000 personnel -- as well as 100 engines and nine helicopters -- were battling that blaze, which had destroyed 44 homes and 18 other structures from its start June 12 through Sunday. The weather has hardly been cooperating in the fight, with humidity at 7% and temperatures topping 96 degrees. The National Weather Service forecast winds should weaken somewhat in the early part of this week, to between 7 mph and 13 mph in Sierra Vista, Arizona, though temperatures were still expected to remain in the 90s or higher all week. People living in Sierra Vista were ordered to leave Sunday while firefighters conducted burn-out operations in an attempt to stop the fire moving that way, CNN's Thelma Gutierrez reported from the area. Even as the flames spread, some Sierra Vista residents turned to their faith. ""There are disasters, calamities and tragedies,"" Tucson Bishop Gerald Kicanas said during a special weekend service at St. Andrew the Apostle Church, reported CNN affiliate KGUN-TV in Tucson. ""We are with them in solidarity,"" Kicanas said. ""We pray for an end to the fire, we pray for the safety of our firefighters and we pray that the monsoon rains will come and free us from these terrible fires that have been so devastating."" The church is taking donations for fire victims. Will Posko said he is housing several people in his home. ""Our hearts go out to those people,"" Posko told KGUN.  ""We all have to help one another in this community."" Parishioner Tom Felix said the community's spirit and support overwhelmed him. ""Coming here ... and just seeing everybody, my goodness that's beautiful faith,"" he told KGUN. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has issued emergency declarations for the Monument Fire and another blaze, Horseshoe II, making Cochise County eligible for $100,000 toward response and recovery expenses. In Texas, critical fire weather conditions were predicted across much of the state Monday, the Texas Forest Service said. The forest service is battling 20 wildfires, with 12 new large blazes reported Sunday. Some 500 homes are threatened in Jasper County, the service said, and 163 have been evacuated in Walker County. Nationwide, wildfires have burned almost as many acres in the first half of 2011 as were recorded by the National Interagency Fire Center for all of last year. The agency website reports 3.1 million acres in the United States had been ignited by wildfires as of May 31, compared with 3.2 million burned acres cited in the organization's year-end report in November 2010. One Arizona blaze that started May 29 has mushroomed into a historically large wildfire. Known as the Wallow Fire, it has burned 519,319 acres and was 51% contained as of Sunday evening. This fire caused power outages Sunday in Arizona cities Blue and parts of Alpine, Nutrioso and Greer, the Navopache Electric Cooperative reported on its website. Generators are powering some of the company's New Mexico customers as well as those in Alpine, Arizona. Residents of Luna, New Mexico, were ordered to evacuate Saturday afternoon after the blaze jumped containment lines along U.S. 180, according to InciWeb. But fire public information officer Rich Szlauko had some good news, saying that in terms of bringing the Wallow Fire under control, ""Everything is starting to look pretty good."" Some 3,600 people continue to battle the blaze, in the face of winds Sunday measuring 20 mph to 30 mph, he said. But even with marginally improved conditions, authorities across the Southwest and southern Plains enforced expanded evacuations as flames cut off power to communities.

"(WIRED) -- If you're a die-hard baseball or basketball fan, Steve Jobs just made your day. With its latest software update for Apple TV, Apple is now offering easy streaming of MLB and NBA games directly through its $100 media-streaming unit. All you need an active subscription to either service, and you can have unlimited access to every baseball and basketball game through your Apple TV, subject to local blackout rules, of course. MLB.TV streaming had previously been available for Roku and PlayStation 3, but built-in Apple TV functionality brings an ease of use and integration previously unseen. There are two subscription models for MLB.TV, $100 a year for standard and $120 for the premium offering (which boasts home and away broadcasts, in-game DVR capability, and different camera options). NBA League Pass has also been available for online streaming and directly mobile apps for Android and iOS, and the Apple TV bundle comes in two sizes: a $65 option if you pick seven teams to watch, as well as $100 for unlimited streaming. (Although, real penny-pinchers could just purchase the mobile version, which costs $70 less than the Apple TV version, and just AirPlay that to your HDTV, another new feature of iOS 4.3.) How much more business will the move bring in for Apple, MLB and the NBA? Millions of dollars over time, although much more Apple TV penetration will be needed before that comes to bear.

"(CNN) -- South African golf was handed another boost on Tuesday when the country was awarded the right to host one of the lucrative World Golf Championships events for the next five years. The news comes after Charl Schwartzel joined 2010 British Open winner Louis Oosthuizen as a reigning major champion with his dramatic victory at the Masters on Sunday. ""This is, without doubt, the most significant milestone in the history of professional golf in South Africa,"" Sunshine Tour commissioner Gareth Tindall said on his return from Augusta following meetings with the U.S. PGA Tour and the International Federation of PGA Tours. ""It is something that we have been working on for a long time, and the unanimous support that we have received from the other professional tours around the world confirms the major standing of our players and the Sunshine Tour in world golf. ""What is even more significant is that we have the commitment that we will host this World Golf Championships event for a period of five years. That has enormously positive implications for the game and for our country as a whole."" Can McIlroy conquer the mental minefield? It will be known as the ""Tournament of Hope"" and will try to build awareness of poverty and HIV/AIDS in Africa. The three of the four WGC events held in the U.S. have prize money higher than the season's four major tournaments, while the HSBC Champions in China is comparable. The date and venue for South Africa's first staging next year have yet to be announced, but it will feature the top 70 players in the world. Meanwhile, this year's South African Open has been moved back a week to ensure the tournament will not clash with the President's Cup in Australia due to be held from November 17-20, with several players from the country expected to feature in the International team to take on the United States. The Alfred Dunhill Championship will be played during the week of the Melbourne event.","Sunshine Tour lands deal to stage WGC event for five years from 2012 .

"Washington (CNN) -- The estate of the late actress Anna Nicole Smith has lost a Supreme Court appeal in a longstanding fight to secure a share of her deceased husband's fortune. The 5-4 ruling Thursday was the latest chapter in a tedious legal soap opera, over the kind of evidence a separate bankruptcy court may hear when deciding various claims and counterclaims. State courts generally hear probate cases, while bankruptcy proceedings are confined to federal courts. The high court's 38-page decision will now likely put an end to this particular legal dispute. J. Howard Marshall was married to the much younger Smith, who is named in court papers as Vickie Lynn Marshall, for 14 months before he died in 1995. His will left nearly all assets and trust to his son from a previous marriage, E. Pierce Marshall, and Smith received virtually nothing. She later sued, claiming her elderly husband promised to give her more than $300 million. The separate estate of Smith, who died more than three years ago, has been fighting for years to secure a share of the deceased Texas oilman's fortune. At issue now in the probate dispute was the kind of evidence a separate bankruptcy court may hear when deciding various claims and counterclaims. In the court's very narrow ruling on a very complex issue, Chief Justice John Roberts concluded, ""The [federal] bankruptcy court below lacked the constitutional authority to enter final judgment on a state law counterclaim that is not resolved in the process of ruling on a creditor's proof of claim."" Translation: Smith's estate lost. Court records shows she had already received about $7 million in cash and gifts during their brief union. In 2006, the high court gave Smith a temporary victory when it allowed her to continue the legal fight, after earlier judicial setbacks. Smith's appearance in the Supreme Court during the first oral arguments caused a minor media sensation, with cameras jockeying for position as she entered and left the building. Despite the colorful details contained in the legal briefs, the issue this time for the Supreme Court remained fairly pedestrian. The justices decided whether Smith's estate received a proper hearing in federal courts, and whether state probate courts should be the proper venue for hearing such cases. The so-called ""probate exception"" normally keeps federal courts from hearing such disputes, but there is no law mandating the hands-off approach. The high court tried to sort out what is a ""core"" -- or essential -- issue in a bankruptcy proceeding. Smith had made several personal-injury allegations against Pierce Marshall -- who died in 2006 -- during the bitter bankruptcy hearings. Smith's estate claims that it was a ""core"" proceeding the judge should have been allowed to sort out and decide. Smith, a onetime Playboy and jeans model, reality TV star and diet company spokeswoman, went to both state and federal courts to press her claims. The Supreme Court did not delve into matters raised in past legal proceedings: whether document tampering happened, whether Smith was kept from her husband's bedside as he was dying, and how the money should be divided. In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer said the majority opinion would only create confusion for those filing bankruptcy claims.  A total of 1.6 million such claims were filed last year, an ever-increasing trend. ""A constitutionally required game of jurisdictional ping-pong between courts would lead to inefficiency, increased cost, delay, and needless additional suffering among those faced with bankruptcy,"" he said. He was supported by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. The justices in their second hearing in the case in March did not mention either Smith or Pierce Marshall by name, or comment about the celebrity aspect of the dispute. The questions they posed at oral argument were on mundane issues tied to interpretation of bankruptcy law, a topic only some lawyers and judges would appreciate. Howard Marshall, a Yale-educated businessman, was 89 in 1994 when he married the then-26-year-old Texan. They had met a few years earlier at a strip club where she worked. Smith died of a drug overdose in 2007, leaving behind a young daughter from a later relationship. That has created the unusual scenario of executors of competing estates fighting over still-frozen assets. State and federal courts have disagreed over the years on whether Smith should receive any part of the money. A U.S. bankruptcy judge initially awarded her $474 million, which later was reduced to about $90 million. A federal appeals court has since twice dismissed Smith's case. A state probate court also dismissed her claims, saying Pierce Marshall was the sole heir. Leading the fight on behalf of Smith is Howard K. Stern, her attorney and onetime boyfriend. Stern was cleared of criminal charges by a judge earlier this year in Los Angeles. He had been accused conspiring to feed Smith's drug addiction and using false names to obtain the drugs. He and two doctors charged as co-conspirators had denied wrongdoing. Pierce Marshall's wife, Elaine, is the key party on the other side.","J. Howard Marshall left Smith virtually nothing .

"(CNN) -- At least 150 people drowned when a boat leaving Libya capsized off the Tunisian coast on Wednesday, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday. Scores more were still missing Friday as a rescue operation by Tunisian authorities continued. The overcrowded boat, which set sail Saturday from Tripoli, was headed for Lampedusa, in Italy, carrying about 850 people. The passengers were mostly migrants from West Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh who were fleeing fighting in Libya, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement. The agency, which did not indicate how many people had been rescued, said some survivors reported the boat was manned by people with little or no maritime experience. Soon after the boat left Tripoli, it ran into difficulties and by Tuesday the passengers ran out of food and water. The boat ran aground Wednesday near the Kerkennah Islands, some 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) northwest of Tripoli in the Mediterranean Sea, UNHCR reported. ""Desperate passengers rushed to one side, seeking rescue by the Tunisian coast guard and fishing boats that had approached the vessel,"" and the boat capsized, the agency said in a statement. ""This appears to be one of the worst and the deadliest incidents in the Mediterranean so far this year,"" Adrian Edwards, a UNHCR spokesman in Geneva, said. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter the European Union. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked the dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February. At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of Lampedusa, which numbers less than 6,000. ""Boats loaded with migrants fleeing the ongoing conflict in Libya have been making the journey to Italy and Malta over recent months, sometimes with tragic consequences. Just last month, hundreds died as a vessel carrying about 600 people broke up shortly after departing Tripoli,"" UNHCR said in its statement.","Thousands of refugees from fighting in Libya have tried to flee to Europe .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama took his act to New York on Thursday as the featured attraction at three back-to-back fundraisers, where he touted his progressive credentials, including support for equal rights for gay couples. Obama kicked off his evening with a dinner that cost $35,800 a plate at Daniel, Chef Daniel Boulud's Upper East Side restaurant. Then he headed several blocks south to the LGBT Leadership Council gala at the Sheraton Hotel in midtown Manhattan. After condemning discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, the president drew rigorous applause when he addressed same-sex couples. ""I believe that gay couples deserve the same rights as every couple in this country,"" Obama said. The president, who during the 2008 campaign said he wouldn't promote same-sex marriage but did support civil unions, did not use the word ""marriage"" in his speech. His speech came amid some frustration that Obama, even given his efforts to rescind the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy prohibiting gays from serving openly, has not gone far or fast enough in backing gay rights. In his speech, Obama acknowledged that the ""change"" he'd promised wouldn't be easy, nor would it always be quick. ""I did not run for president to do easy things,"" he said. ""It was time for us to do hard things, the big things, even if it was going to take time."" About 600 people paid $1,250 apiece to attend the event. They included Jane Lynch of ""Glee"" and the night's master of ceremonies, Neil Patrick Harris of ""How I Met Your Mother."" Before the event, the Republican National Committee jabbed at Harris' show, putting out an e-mail titled ""Legen - Wait for it,"" which is a blog for updates on ""How I Met Your Mother."" The e-mail went on to say ""Obama heads to the Big Apple for a round of celebrity-studded fundraisers while Americans are desperate for economic leadership from the president."" The third fundraiser for Obama was a performance of ""Sister Act"" at the Broadway Theater, for hundreds of guests, including actor Whoopi Goldberg. Tickets for the performance started at $100 per person. Earlier Thursday, in a release ahead of the president's fundraisers, RNC spokesman Ryan Tronovitch said that ""while President Obama tries to escape the pressures of his failed economic policies with a fundraiser in New York, millions remain out of work and are beginning to realize that the only job our president is concerned about is his own."" The Democratic National Committee was quick to respond. ""Republicans are getting hammered in their districts from coast-to-coast for embracing a plan that kicks seniors to the curb by ending Medicare and because they have not presented a single idea in the past six months to create jobs. Republicans would fare better if they spent more time working to find solutions to the nation's problems rather than engaging in typical, cheap Washington political tricks,"" DNC Communications Director Brad Woodhouse said in a statement to CNN. The money raised from the fundraisers will go to the Obama Victory Fund, with the proceeds shared by the president's re-election campaign and the Democratic National Committee. This is the second night this week Obama has headlined fundraisers. He was the main attraction at two fundraisers at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in the nation's capital Monday. Vice President Joe Biden headlined a fundraiser in Chicago on Tuesday. Democratic sources said the Obama Victory Fund hopes to bring in $60 million by the end of the second quarter, which comes to a close at the end of the month. Most people remember that Obama shattered all records by raising nearly $750 million in his bid for the White House in 2008, but what isn't as well known is that he brought in $59 million for his presidential campaign during the first half of 2007. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Barack Obama attends 3 fundraisers in New York on Thursday .

"New York (CNN) -- Have you ever dreamed of watching every game of an entire baseball season? Be careful what you wish for. Major League Baseball intends to have two lucky fans do just that. Starting Thursday, Major League Baseball's opening day, contest winners Mike O'Hara and ""wingman"" Ryan Wagner will view the entire 2011 season in the brand-new ""MLB Fan Cave,"" a Major League Baseball press release announced Wednesday. That means O'Hara and Wagner will view 2,430 regular season games, along with all post-season games, while stationed in front of three 60-inch TVs surrounded by a dozen 32-inch TVs, according to MLB. In addition, these co-fanatics will spend their time, ""chronicling their experiences and sharing their viewpoints on baseball and pop culture through Facebook, Twitter, a blog on MLB.com, custom videos and regular appearances on MLB Network,"" the release said. ""The MLB Fan Cave will give fans a creative new way to experience Major League Baseball,"" said Tim Brosnan, the Executive Vice President of Business for the MLB. ""This is going to be a real-time experience which brings to life how people consume entertainment in 2011 with baseball at the center of it all."" If you're wondering why or how anybody would commit to this, you're not alone. As O'Hara points out in a video released by MLB.com, ""Anytime somebody says you're going to go live in a cave you're frightened right off the bat... bears live in a cave, not people."" But this is not your average cave and the project has been under way since right after the World Series, MLB spokesperson Matt Bourne told CNN. The 15,000-square-foot space in lower Manhattan was designed by Paul DiMeo of ABC's ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,"" Wednesday's press release revealed. It contains an 18-foot statue of Willie Mays, a deejay booth, a 1950s-style Pepsi Cafe, a Budweiser Game Room, a Fantasy Baseball Corner, and a pitching alley complete with a radar gun. But the release also indicates that the cave is not just for the cavemen. The space will hold frequent events and offer haircuts and tattoos as well. On select days, the cave will offer appraisals for baseball memorabilia, and most importantly, we can all follow along through digital media to see if these two fans can do the impossible.","Two contest winners will watch every game of the 2011 baseball season .

"(CNN) -- In late November, U.S. soldiers were supervising artillery training for Afghan troops in Nangarhar province, close to the Pakistan border. After they climbed a ridge to assess the impact area, an Afghan border policeman suddenly turned on them and opened fire. Seconds later, six Americans and their assailant were dead. It was one of the deadliest incidents of what the military call ""green on blue"" -- a euphemism for attacks by members of the Afghan security forces on their allies in the international force known as ISAF. They have risen sharply over the past year, raising fears that the Taliban are infiltrating the Afghan National Army and police force. But military analysts and intelligence officials say the reality is more complicated. The Taliban said they had recruited the border policeman, but his real motive was never established, and it transpired that he'd had an argument with his father over his choice of bride. In an even deadlier incident, an Afghan air force officer shot dead eight U.S. Air Force personnel and a U.S. contractor at Kabul International Airport in March. But there is little to suggest he was a Taliban infiltrator either. According to a NATO analysis seen by CNN, ""green on blue"" attacks have killed 52 U.S. and allied soldiers since 2005, many of them in the past year. The analysis concludes that combat stress provoked 36% of the attacks, even if the Taliban subsequently claimed responsibility. In 23% cases, an Afghan soldier had been persuaded by the Taliban to carry out an attack -- but the motive in an additional 32% of cases was unknown. A senior intelligence official involved in NATO's training program told CNN that ""battlefield conditions and frequent deployments are the leading causes"" of such incidents. ""When you are in the mountains for months, you've just had enough,"" he said. The official said cultural differences over the handling of weapons and the attitude of western soldiers to Afghan women can exacerbate tensions. Coalition officers often reprimand their Afghan colleagues for lax control of weaponry, and that can breed resentment. Some incidents defy explanation. In late 2008, an Afghan soldier liked and relied upon by his U.S. comrades in Wardak province suddenly turned his gun on them and shot two dead before fleeing. He was never found. For the Taliban, infiltration is a cheap tactic and one they boast about. Beyond the incidents, it sows mistrust and apprehension on a wider scale among troops who should be cooperating. As the struggle against the Taliban reaches its climax, military analysts say a growing ""insider threat"" could be disruptive. For example, after three German soldiers were shot dead by an Afghan soldier this year, some of their comrades refused to go on patrol with their Afghan counterparts, according to the magazine Spiegel. Earlier this month, Lt. Gen. William Caldwell, the commander of the NATO training mission, admitted recent incidents ""erode the hard-earned trust that is required for an effective partnership."" But the senior intelligence official told CNN that the insurgents' efforts to infiltrate Afghan security forces had not so far yielded much of a dividend and wasn't anywhere near the top concerns facing ISAF. He pointed out that the 52 coalition deaths caused by Afghan security personnel were a small percentage of nearly 2,000 ""hostile fatalities"" between 2005 and 2011. Other estimates are higher -- but include killings by Afghan contractors and incidents of ""impersonation,"" where an insurgent launches an attack disguised as a soldier or policeman. Police and military uniforms are easy to come by in Afghanistan. In one incident this year, a soldier passed on a uniform and identification to a suicide bomber who attacked a military hospital in Kabul. Six people were killed. One reason ""green on blue"" attacks have risen is because there's more interaction between U.S. and Afghan soldiers as the latter take on more responsibility. There are about 290,000 Afghans in uniform. The number of joint military patrols has increased drastically, exceeding 10,000 last year. Among measures being taken to prevent such attacks, commanders are told to ensure Afghan troops who've been in combat are getting adequate rest; and coalition officers are being taught to watch for warning signs. More U.S. counter-intelligence officers are being deployed to Afghanistan to help with screening recruits and reviewing the profiles of serving soldiers. The recruiting process now includes eight steps. A recruit's application must be supported by two letters from community elders. Gradually a nationwide database of Afghan security forces is being compiled based on biometric information. Some fifty Afghans at the Interior Ministry, helped by the FBI, are populating the database. The objective is to screen out anyone with a criminal record or links to the insurgency. The process of vetting and biometrically enrolling the records of nearly 300,000 Afghan security forces will be completed  this year, according to a NATO training mission document compiled in February.","Attacks spark fears that the  Taliban are infiltrating the Afghan forces .

"(CNN) -- After nearing the all-time record, gas prices in the United States are sliding downward, with another drop possible in the next few days, according to a survey published Sunday. The Lundberg Survey found the average price of a gallon of self-serve regular gasoline nationwide was $3.91 as of Friday, publisher Trilby Lundberg said. The price represents a drop of just over 9 cents from May 6, when prices hit the $4 mark. The all-time high for U.S. gas prices was $4.11 on July 11, 2008, she said. The drop ""comes from the crude oil price slump earlier this month,"" Lundberg said, ""and it looks like there's perhaps another dime drop at the pump in the next few days."" However, whether the drop is more or less than a dime depends on several factors, including what crude oil prices do next and whether flooding in the Southeast, which has caused transport delays, does not worsen, she said. Asked whether crude oil prices may rise again, Lundberg said, ""It certainly is possible at any time."" However, the recent high prices have contributed to a dampening of world demand, she said, and demand at the pump in the United States is down ""with a double whammy"" -- unemployment and underemployment, as well as the Southeast flooding. The Friday price is about $1.08 higher than the price a year ago -- $2.83 on May 21, 2010. The city with the highest average price in the latest survey was Chicago, at $4.38 per gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest was Jackson, Mississippi, at $3.60. Different tax levels in different states are a major factor in bringing about diverse prices. Here are some other average prices in a panel of large cities: . -- Salt Lake City $3.67 . -- St. Louis $3.74 . -- Houston $3.79 . -- Atlanta $3.91 . -- Boston $3.98 . -- San Francisco Bay area $4.17 .","The average U.S. price is $3.91 per gallon .

"(CNN) -- English golfer Robert Rock completed a wire-to-wire success at the Italian Open on Sunday to clinch his first European Tour title. The 34-year-old, who led from Thursday's opening round, carded a five-under-par 67 to finish on 21-under 267 as he triumphed by two shots in Turin. The win, after nine years on the circuit, boosted his hopes of impressing in his first U.S. Open start at Congressional next week -- his first major appearance outside of Britain. The world No. 165 ended up one shot ahead of compatriot Gary Boyd, who shot 66, and Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen -- who surged up the leaderboard with a superb 62. Rock steady as Englishman bids for maiden European Tour title . ""I have been waiting a long time to be even in with a chance of doing this,"" Rock told reporters. ""I played good today so I am very happy. ""It's a fantastic feeling, it's one of my favorite courses now. Since they changed the venue I have done well here. I was expecting to do well this week, but not really expecting this."" The 21-year-old Olesen started with two birdies and an eagle, and completed his front nine in just 29 strokes before setting the clubhouse lead on 20 under. Boyd matched that with a birdie at the final hole, his eighth of the day after bogeys at his first and 10th holes. Rock, runner-up three times in Europe including in 2009 at the same Royal Park I Roveri course, had extended his lead to two shots by the end of Saturday's third round but lost ground with a bogey at his third hole. He bounced back with four birdies in a row from the fifth, and then another three in four holes from 10 marred only by another bogey at 12. Rock knew he could win by coming home in par, which he managed despite driving into the trees at 17 as he did well to escape back onto the fairway, pitched to 12 feet and sank his clutch putt. Scotland's Pete Whiteford was fourth on 19 under after a 66, one ahead of Dutchman Joost Luiten (68). Home hopes Francesco Molinari and Matteo Manassero tied for eighth on 16 under after finishing with 70 and 68 respectively. Molinari won the tournament in 2006 for his first European Tour success, while the 18-year-old Manassero had been seeking his third title since turning professional 13 months ago.","Robert Rock ends nine-year wait to win his first European Tour title .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Top officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the air traffic controllers' union kicked off a cross-country tour of air traffic control facilities on Monday, two days after a seventh reported case this year of a controller falling asleep on the job. FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt and Paul Rinaldi, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, are expected to hold a series of meetings about safety and professionalism. Their first stop was at a radar facility in the Atlanta area. ""None of us in this business can tolerate any of this,"" Babbitt said of the sleeping controllers. ""It absolutely has to stop. ... One mistake is one too many."" This ""will not be tolerated,"" he insisted. ""We run the safest system in the world,"" but these incidents have ""cast a cloud."" Inside the life of an air traffic controller . Babbitt described himself as ""infuriated"" after learning about the lapses. ""Any time (there) is less than perfection, we have issues,"" Rinaldi added. ""It's a very big concern,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Monday. ""We will do better."" Federal officials announced a series of new regulations Saturday aimed at preventing air traffic controllers from falling asleep while on duty. Among other things, controllers now must have a minimum of nine hours off between shifts, instead of the current minimum of eight hours. In addition, controllers can no longer be put on an unscheduled midnight shift following a day off. If the shift from eight to nine hours isn't enough, ""then obviously we'll take that into consideration,"" LaHood said. But it's up to the controllers ""to take personal responsibility"" and get adequate rest during their down time, he said. FAA managers will also schedule their own shifts in a way to ensure greater coverage in the early morning and late night hours, the secretary noted over the weekend. On Saturday, the FAA suspended an air traffic controller for sleeping on the job at the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center. According to a preliminary review of air traffic tapes, the controller did not miss any calls from aircraft, and there was no operational impact, the agency said in a statement. The incident was reported to a manager by another controller, the FAA said. There were 12 controllers and two managers on duty at the time. Last week, the head of the FAA Air Traffic Organization, Hank Krakowski, resigned over the uproar caused by the recent spate of incidents. David Grizzle, the FAA's chief counsel, has been named acting chief of the unit. Will NextGen air traffic overhaul make us safer? Aside from Miami, cases of sleeping controllers have been reported in Washington; Knoxville, Tennessee; Seattle and Reno, Nevada. There have been two suspected cases in Lubbock, Texas. All of the incidents occurred during controllers' midnight shifts. Most of the lapses occurred at local control towers. In at least one incident, the FAA has said, the controller deliberately went to sleep, while some of the others appear to have been accidental. CNN's Mike Ahlers and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: FAA officials, union representatives begin a cross-country tour in Atlanta .

"(CNN) -- As the players run on to the court, the excitement begins to build in the arena full of fiercely loyal basketball fans.  It's a small arena with capacity for only 1,200 people, not counting standing-room-only tickets.  As the members of the team are introduced, fans jump up to cheer them on, clapping and chanting, full of team spirit.  ""I've been yelling my heart out!"" says a fan who arrived early for the game. The team is ""The Miners"" and on a recent night it was playing at home in Cananea, a town of 33,000 in northwestern Mexico, known for its large deposits of copper and other metals.  One of the largest mining companies in Mexico operates in the town about 35 miles south of the Arizona border. It's an unlikely place for foreigners, but not when it comes to sports. Davin White, 29, is an American immigrant in Cananea and a star forward for the Miners.  White attended California State University in Northridge and has also played in Serbia, Italy and Qatar. But Cananea is much closer to his native Phoenix.  ""The town is very small, but the people are very energetic when it comes to basketball,"" says White. He doesn't speak Spanish, but that doesn't seem to be a problem on the court.  Teammate Brandon Brown, another immigrant athlete, says he has learned a few words.  ""I don't think you want to hear what I've learned in Spanish,"" Brown says with a smile.  The 25-year-old from New Orleans, who attended the University of California at San Bernardino, says he has fallen in love with Mexican food, especially carne asada, or Mexican-style grilled steak. Communication among team members is made possible by head coach Andres Contreras, a Mexico City native and former player in Mexican leagues, who is bilingual.  Other teammates are bilingual as well.  ""It's a good challenge because I have to talk in Spanish and in English at the same time sometimes,"" says Contreras. The Cananea Miners are one of 12 teams in what is known as CIBACOPA (the Spanish acronym for Basketball Circuit of the Pacific Coast). Dozens of foreigners play on the league, with teams in most of the northwestern Mexican states, including Nayarit, Sinaloa, Baja California and Sonora, home of Cananea. Under Mexican law, each basketball team is allowed no more than three foreigners on the roster.  The law also allows one additional foreigner born to Mexican parents per team.  Roberto Laporte owns the Hermosillo Rays, another team in the northern Mexican league.  He says communication has never been a problem for his team.  ""Other team members usually speak both languages.  If they don't, they're used to playing with American players and I always look for coaches that speak both Spanish and English,"" says Laporte, who also speaks fluent English. His coach is Dan Tacheny.  The 30-year-old worked for five years in the NBA as a scout for the Orlando Magic and the Minnesota Timberwolves.  Tacheny says that some Americans play in Mexican leagues to stay on top of their game while looking for other opportunities.  ""Obviously money is a factor.  It's a job to have in professional basketball, first of all.  But second of all, being in Mexico is close to home for Americans,"" says Tacheny, who has a home in Las Vegas where his wife lives. Five-thousand dollars a month, the average salary for a foreign athlete at this level, may seem terrible in the United States, but that kind of money can go a long way in Mexico, where minimum wage is less than $5 per day.  To survive, a team needs to spend about $350,000 per season.  It doesn't sound like much, but it becomes a challenge when fans in Cananea pay just over $6 per ticket. Sponsors bridge the gap. The season in northern Mexico is four months long.  Some players use the rest of the year to play in Eastern European and South American leagues. In a country that sends countless migrant workers to the United States every year, some find it ironic that they're being entertained by migrant American athletes.  ""Migrant workers from here go look for a better future in the U.S.  In this case, these guys are coming here to keep on doing what they love for a living,"" says Orlando Cañedo, a Miners fan. As the game draws to a close, Davin White scores another three-pointer, clinching the victory for the Miners in an action-packed reminder that a good ball game knows no borders.","Basketball draws excitement south of the border .

"London, England (CNN) -- Speculation was intense Friday over where and when Prince William will marry Kate Middleton, with many predicting the couple will choose the iconic, thousand-year-old Westminster Abbey. Middleton was photographed leaving the abbey Wednesday night with her parents, and British newspapers reported they had a private after-hours tour. Westminster Abbey is the ""venue of choice"" for the wedding, the Daily Mirror tabloid reported Friday, and it even published a seating plan for the big day. Ladbrokes betting agents seemed certain Friday that Westminster Abbey would be chosen, giving it 1/33 odds. A CNN/ComRes poll out Friday found the British public largely positive about the engagement, which was announced Tuesday, a few weeks after William proposed. Nearly eight in 10 of those surveyed -- 79 percent -- said they believe the engagement will be good for the monarchy. Opinion was split, however, on who should succeed Queen Elizabeth -- whether Charles, who is next in line, or William -- though more respondents said William and Middleton would make a better king and queen than Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. In general, older people and those in higher income groups were more likely to take a traditional line and be more favorable toward Charles and Camilla, compared to those who are younger or in poorer income groups, according to the poll, which surveyed 2,015 adults in Britain between Wednesday and Friday. Westminster Abbey was founded in 960, with the present Gothic church dating to 1245. Since 1066, it has been the ""coronation church"" -- the place where kings and queens are crowned when they ascend to the throne. Its close ties to the monarchy mean it has also been the site of many royal weddings and funerals. Queen Elizabeth II married Prince Philip there in 1947, when she was still a princess; her father, King George VI, got married there in 1923. The funeral service for Princess Diana, William's mother, took place there in 1997. Another possible venue is St. Paul's Cathedral, where Diana married Prince Charles in 1981 in a wedding watched by millions worldwide. Ladbrokes gave that option 10/1 odds, and 16/1 odds for St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. Others have also suggested as possible venues the London church of St. Clement Danes, the central church of the Royal Air Force, in which Prince William serves -- or the Chapel of St. Salvator at the University of St. Andrews, where the prince and Middleton met as students. The palace has said the wedding will take place in the spring or summer of 2011. The most likely month for the nuptials, according to Ladbrokes, was May, followed in order by July, June, then August. British Prime Minister David Cameron wants a national holiday for the day of the wedding, his office at Downing Street said Friday, though the government must approve that first.","NEW: Poll shows British are largely positive about the wedding .

"Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- Single mothers in Morocco are breaking records. A recent study published by a Casablanca support group for single mothers says the number of Morocco's unmarried mothers in 2009 is at least double those in 2008 -- 27,200 compared with 11,016 the year before, according to the Institution Nationale de Solidarite Avec Les Femmes en Distresse. As in most Muslim countries, it is considered an intolerable shame on a family in Morocco if a daughter falls pregnant outside marriage. In many cases, families totally reject a daughter who becomes pregnant before marriage. Morocco's unmarried mothers are mostly young, said Houda El Bourahi, the institute's director. The study shows 60% are younger than 26 and a third younger than 20, she said. According to the 350-page report, the mothers are often in ""vulnerable"" professions, such as house servants, and the majority have a low level of schooling. Often, the women believe that their sexual partners will marry them, and so agree to their demands, according to the study. Despite Morocco being modern in so many respects, strong prejudice still remains against unwed mothers from most groups of society. ""It's time to put an end to prejudices held against these women though who are considered by (Moroccan) society as prostitutes,"" El Bourahi said. ""These women are rejected by their families and by society and are not protected by the law."" Since the end of last year, 7,000 women in Casablanca alone had been assisted at the organization's Center of Listening on the outskirts of the city, the commercial capital of Morocco with a population of almost 4 million. Furthermore, 2,000 children have been accepted legally by the civil state and 540 have been recognized by their fathers. The women's rights agenda has accelerated dramatically in recent years in Morocco largely following an initiative by King Mohammed VI to give women more equality, both at home and in the workplace. A new law adopted in 2004 gave women more rights as wives, for example. Still, few men accept unmarried mothers and their offspring despite less of a stigma these days toward women who take up jobs and consider virginity to be an outdated virtue. While many men consider single mothers to be prostitutes, sex workers reportedly represent a tiny percentage of Morocco's unmarried mothers.","A recent study says number of unwed mothers in Morocco rose dramatically from 2008 to 2009 .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's prime minister urged Afghan government officials to look for other partners to ally with beyond the United States in a meeting earlier this month, and suggested it seek closer ties with China, a source close to the Afghan government told CNN. But Afghan sources disagree on how strongly the Pakistanis were trying to push their neighbors, and there is no indication from either source CNN spoke to about the Afghan government's receptiveness to the idea. At the meeting between senior Afghan and Pakistani officials April 16 in Kabul, Afghanistan, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Gilani urged the Afghans to draw closer to Pakistan and to China, disengaging with what he depicted as a weakened United States, according to the source close to the Afghan government. The meeting was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The source, who did not attend the meeting but has spoken with a number of the officials who were present, said that while the topic was not the only subject discussed in the meeting, Gilani did tell the Afghans that Pakistan can protect them but they need to accelerate the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country. Gilani, the source said, painted the United States as a declining power, weakened economically, and in debt to China. ""What motivated Islamabad to do this is not clear,"" this source said, ""but the relationship with the U.S. is at an all-time low, (Afghan President Hamid) Karzai is very unhappy with the U.S., and they saw an opportunity make this point."" In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, described the accounts of his prime minister's activities as a ""complete fabrication."" ""Where are Pakistan and Afghanistan going to go by dumping the United States?"" Haqqani said. ""The fact of the matter is Afghanistan is a country that needs the Americans to rebuild. Pakistan is a country that needs American assistance."" Haqqani said he is expecting U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to visit the region ""in the near future."" The State Department has not confirmed the trip yet. ""I think that Pakistan, Afghanistan and United States will work together,"" Haqqani said. ""Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is committed.... Look to her leadership. We expect her to be in the region. We will be moving forward together, together, and that these stories are going to die as many similar stories died in the past."" A senior source in Afghanistan's presidential palace also told CNN that the meeting did not center on a concerted effort to get Afghanistan to drop its long-term partnership plans with the United States. ""There is no planned effort to try to tell Afghanistan that it has to leave the United States as its ally. We are allies with and we want to be friends with our neighbours,"" the palace source said. That source said the Afghan government wants ""to make sure no one feels vulnerable by our long-term partnership"" with Washington, referring to Pakistan. ""Of course, the Pakistani delegation had negotiations on Afghan bilateral relations to strengthen them and they have their concerns,"" the palace source added. In a statement responding to the Wall Street Journal story, the Pakistani government called the assertions in the article ""baseless."" ""Pakistan fully supports an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned process for peace and reconciliation. This fundamental principle is now widely acknowledged,"" the statement said. ""Pakistan recognizes the key role of the United States in promoting stability, peace and harmony in Afghanistan."" Next month, the United States, Afghanistan and Pakistan are holding a tri-lateral meeting in Islamabad, noted the statement from Pakistan. ""The purpose of ongoing engagements with Afghanistan and the United States is to have strategic coherence and clarity,"" the statement noted. At the Kabul meeting, the source close to the Afghanistan government said, Gilani read from a prepared text -- something uncommon at such meetings, which usually are more informal. This was an indication, the source said, that the ideas presented had been worked on and were not just off-the-cuff comments. There was nothing ""provocative"" in the remarks, the source said, but one must read ""between the lines."" ""It tells more about relations between the U.S. and Pakistan and how they have hit rock-bottom,"" the source said, than it does about Pakistan-Afghan relations. Pakistan's generals, who exert enormous influence on the government, the source said, ""want to go back to the 1980s."" ""They're stuck in a time warp in which they think they can push back at the U.S. and force the U.S. to deal with them in a regional, not just national, context."" The relationship between the United States and Pakistan has been tense in recent months, following the arrest and subsequent release of CIA contractor Raymond Davis, who was charged with killing two Pakistani men in what he said was a robbery attempt in Lahore. Ties have also been strained over CIA drone strikes at targets in Pakistan, near the Afghan border. Several strikes have claimed the lives of what some Pakistani officials have said were innocent civilians. The United States does not officially acknowledge the CIA's secret drone program that targets al Qaeda militants, but it is the only country operating in the region with the capability to carry out such strikes. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","The meeting was held in April in Kabul .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Former Soviet leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mikhail Gorbachev is warning that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi could be chased out of his own country if he does not begin to bend to the will of the people. ""Gadhafi reacted so ruthlessly that he might end up being forced out (of his country). I don't want to make predictions or anything, but he's shooting at people; he is using the military and weapons against defenseless people,"" Gorbachev said. In a wide-ranging news conference to announce nominees for his new Gorbachev Awards for ""world changers,"" Gorbachev weighed in on protests rattling the Middle East and criticized the Libyan regime for brutally repressing its own people. ""People are trying to get of out poverty, and they've got nothing to lose. I think it's now very important that Europe and the United States respond to this situation very responsibly,"" he said. The former Soviet leader had blunt criticism for leaders in his own country as well. Gorbachev blamed both President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin for the state of Russian democracy, calling its institutions ""fake."" He added that both are showing incredible arrogance and disrespect for voters when suggesting that they would discuss between the two of them who should run for president in 2012. Gorbachev has been ever more outspoken in recent weeks in criticizing Russian leaders, saying he sees the country becoming increasingly entrenched in a dangerous, authoritarian system. In an interview with a Russian newspaper he co-owns, Gorbachev said he was trying to start a new political party but has been blocked by the Kremlin. He claims Kremlin bosses refuse to officially register and recognize his new social democratic party. Gorbachev says Russia is in need of a democratic revival. Many Russians are ambivalent toward Gorbachev and his legacy. While many concede he brought real change to their lives with greater freedoms under Perestroika and with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many also blame him for hardships that came afterward. Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","Gadhafi is ""using the military ... against defenseless people,"" Mikhail Gorbachev says .

"(CNN) -- LulzSec, the gleeful and secretive band of hackers who appear to be responsible for a string of high-profile and sometimes embarrassing Internet attacks, said it was disbanding. ""For the past 50 days we've been disrupting and exposing corporations, governments, often the general population itself, and quite possibly everything in between, just because we could,"" the group said Saturday in a statement posted on multiple websites. It did not cite a reason. If true, the collective's final act was the posting of what it said were internal company documents from AT&T along with private data from other companies. LulzSec claimed recently to have attacked the CIA website, and took credit for hacking into the website of American public broadcaster PBS and posting a fake story saying the rapper Tupac Shakur was still alive. He was killed nearly 15 years ago. It is unclear whether LulzSec members played a role in the Sony PlayStation Network breach, where hackers broke into Sony Pictures' website, compromising the accounts of over 1 million users, and the gaming company Sega, stealing the details of nearly 1.3 million users. But it posted what it claims is proprietary information from Sony Pictures and other Sony properties' websites. It also claimed responsibility for bringing down the Brazilian government's website earlier this month. When British police announced the arrest of a teenager suspected of hacking into systems and mounting denial of service attacks against a number of international businesses, LulzSec downplayed down his role in the collective. In one post, the collective seemed to suggest that by making its attacks public, it'll push websites to increase security. But it also said releasing people's information is sometimes worth doing because it's fun. Analysts said the group appears to be some sort of spin-off of ""Anonymous,"" the loose coalition of hackers that grew to prominence through their support of the whistleblower site WikiLeaks. But while Anonymous has its own set of moral codes and is largely politically motivated, LulzSec seems to be random. For every hack like the one on PBS, which the group said came out of anger over a documentary about WikiLeaks, there's the cracking of a porn site -- and a subsequent public list of members' e-mail addresses and passwords.","The group claims to have hacked the CIA website, among others .

"(CNN) -- As far as celebrations go, it was hardly the most fitting end to a night of joy for Real Madrid football fans. Having waited 18 years to get their hands on the Copa del Rey -- or King's Cup -- trophy, defender Sergio Ramos made worldwide headlines by dropping it under the open-top bus carrying his teammates on a victory parade through the Spanish capital. The triumphant players had returned home immediately from Valencia after beating arch-rivals Barcelona 1-0 in extra time in the final of the country's knockout competition on Wednesday night. Club vice-captain Ramos was stood at the front of the bus holding the cup, which Real had not won since 1993, when it slipped from his grasp and under the front wheel of the vehicle. There is no official word on whether the cup, which is 78 centimeters tall and weighs nine kilograms, maintained any damage during the incident. But a Real spokeswoman told CNN that it was being fixed. After the mishap, Spanish World Cup winner Ramos used social media website Twitter to reassure fans and say the trophy was undamaged. ""Hehehehe ... everyone, don't worry, it's fine ... Hope you have a good day,"" the 25-year-old wrote. The Spain World Cup winner also joked: ""What happened with the Cup was a misunderstanding, it didn't fall ... it jumped when we got to Cibeles (a square in Madrid) and it saw so many Madridistas (Real fans)..."" The King's Cup has been competed for since 1902, with Real winning the trophy on 18 occasions. Ronaldo gives Jose Mourinho his first trophy at Real . Federico Alegre is the owner of the ""Joyeros y Trofeos Deportivos Alegre"" trophy and jewelry shop which made the cup Ramos dropped. Alegre revealed that there are two versions of the cup and, in his opinion, the potentially damaged one could be beyond repair. ""When (the federation in charge of Spanish football) organizes an event as important as this one, there is always a Plan B,"" he told Spanish radio station CadenaSER. ""So regarding the trophy, there was also a Plan B. With the little amount of time I have been able to evaluate it, I would say it is practically a 'complete wreck.' "" The blemish-free version of the cup is already on display at the nine-time European champions' Santiago Bernabeu stadium. The defeat of the Catalan outfit meant Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho has now won a major honor in each country he has coached in -- Portugal, England, Italy and now Spain. Is Mourinho the master of mind games? The 48-year-old spoke of his pride in the wake of Real's success and his pleasure to have ended a three-year trophy drought at the Bernabeu. ""It is always good to win titles,"" Mourinho told the club's official website. ""Someone called me a 'title coach' a few days ago. I like the name. That is my job. I am proud of my team, the fans and my people. Despite Wednesday's win, Mourinho insisted the result would have no bearing on the upcoming European Champions League semifinal between the two teams. ""We will see in the Champions League. Each [match] will be different. We will see what happens between two great teams over the course of two matches. Anything is possible."" Real and Josep Guardiola's Barca will play the first leg of their last-four tie in Madrid on Wednesday, before the return match at the Camp Nou on May 3. The winner will face England's Manchester United or German side Schalke in the final of Europe's premier club competition at Wembley Stadium, London on May 28.","Sergio Ramos drops the Copa del Rey trophy under Real Madrid's team bus .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration has fired two air traffic controllers, one of whom worked in Knoxville, Tennessee, and the other in Miami, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Wednesday. Both were fired for sleeping incidents, according to the Transportation Department. The firings followed a spate of incidents in which controllers in various cities were reported to be sleeping while on duty. The controllers fired Wednesday were not identified, but one such sleeping incident at the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center was among the most recently reported, with the FAA suspending a unidentified controller there last Saturday. In February, a controller was found sleeping while on duty in the radar room at the McGhee Tyson Airport in Knoxville. The FAA said earlier this month it was taking steps to fire that controller. Aside from Miami and Knoxville, cases of sleeping controllers have been reported in Washington; Seattle, and Reno, Nevada. There have been two suspected cases in Lubbock, Texas. All the incidents occurred during controllers' midnight shifts. Most -- though not all -- of the lapses occurred at local control towers. In at least one incident, the FAA has said the controller deliberately went to sleep, while some of the others appear to have been accidental. In response to the reports, top officials from the FAA and the air traffic controllers' union began a cross-country tour of air traffic control facilities this week to hold a series of meetings about safety and professionalism. And federal officials announced a series of new regulations Saturday aimed at preventing air traffic controllers from falling asleep while on duty. Among other things, controllers now must have a minimum of nine hours off between shifts, instead of the current minimum of eight hours, LaHood said. In addition, controllers can no longer be put on an unscheduled midnight shift following a day off. FAA managers also will schedule their own shifts so as to ensure greater coverage in the early morning and late night hours, the secretary added. LaHood said the FAA and the air traffic controllers' union agreed to implement changes immediately following the series of recent incidents involving sleeping air traffic controllers. CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","The firings follow a spate of reports about snoozing controllers .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghanistan says the Pakistani military is behind recent deadly rocket attacks, but Islamabad says it is not responsible. Aminulllah Amarkhil, Afghan chief of eastern border police, said Monday that Pakistani military forces fired 35 pieces of artillery in Kunar province Sunday that, primary reports indicate, killed 20 civilians. Amarkhil said the rocket attacks began at 4 p.m. and last until midnight. Pakistani forces have been firing rockets on five districts of Kunar province, causing villagers to leave their homes, the police official said. ""During the last month, 36 people were killed and 30 people were injured in these attacks,"" Amarkhil said. Amarkhil also said the Pakistani military shot 37 rockets in the past week on the Goshta district of Nangarhar province. Afghan President Hamid Karzai met with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari in Tehran, Iran, and discussed the attacks, according to a statement from Karzai's office. In the meeting, Karzai asked Zardari for more information about the attacks in the bordering areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Zardari said the Pakistani side was not aware of such attacks and that the attacks were not carried by Pakistani army, according to the statement.","Afghan police official: 36 have been killed from rocket attacks in the past month .

"Brownville, Nebraska (CNN) -- A top manager at one of Nebraska's two nuclear power plants says he's ""100 percent confident"" the facility's countermeasures will keep the overflowing Missouri River from damaging critical gear and causing a hazard to the public. The Cooper Nuclear Power Station, about 80 miles south of Omaha, is still in operation and several feet above the swollen waterway. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jaczko toured the plant Monday, along with a plant north of Omaha that is already surrounded by floodwaters. ""I am not going to predict what is going to happen with the water level,"" Jaczko said. ""Our job is to make sure the licensee does their job to make sure the plant stays safe. Right now, it appears they are taking proactive steps to do that."" The NRC says both Cooper and the Fort Calhoun plant, about 20 miles north of Omaha, have taken precautions against this summer's flooding. And Brian Hasselbring, a reactor operator at Cooper, said even high water won't cause a radiation leak. ""I am 100 percent confident that we are not going to have an issue here,"" Hasselbring said. ""If river levels continue to rise, we will follow our procedures, we will shut down the plant, do whatever is required to maintain our safety."" At Fort Calhoun, as much as two feet of water has forced plant workers to navigate a catwalk from the parking lot, and a water-filled berm that surrounded the reactor containment structure and auxiliary buildings was punctured by a worker early Sunday. A representative of the manufacturer is at the plant helping assess whether the berm can be repaired, the plant's owner, the Omaha Public Power District, said. But the plant has been shut down for refueling since April, and authorities have put floodgates, sandbags and other barriers in place to help protect the facility. Despite the flooding, Fort Calhoun is designed to withstand water up to 1,014 feet above mean sea level, according to the Omaha Public Power District. The river is not expected to exceed 1,008 feet, the OPPD said. Plant managers also have brought in additional diesel fuel for generators should the site lose electricity. Workers switched to those generators briefly to keep the plant's spent fuel cool after water came too close to electrical transformers, but the plant was again drawing power from the electrical grid, utility spokesman Jeff Hanson said Monday. ""The plant is designed, when they get to these higher flood levels, to use their diesel generators when necessary,"" Jaczko said. It was catastrophic flooding from Japan's March 11 tsunami that knocked out cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, resulting in three reactors melting down and producing the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. This year's Midwestern flooding has also led to a spate of rumors about the Fort Calhoun plant that OPPD and the NRC have been trying to knock down. The utility has set up a ""flood rumor control"" page to reassure the public that there has been no release of radioactivity from the plant. An electrical fire June 7 did knock out cooling to its spent fuel storage pool for about 90 minutes, but the coolant water did not reach a boiling point before backup pumps went into service, it has said. Heavy rainfall in Montana and North Dakota, combined with melting snow from the Rocky Mountains, have sent the Missouri surging downstream this summer. The river washed over and punched through levees in northwestern Missouri, spurring authorities to urge about 250 nearby residents to leave their homes. The 6 to 12 inches of rainfall in the upper Missouri basin in the past few weeks is nearly a normal year's worth, and runoff from the mountain snowpack is 140% of normal, according to forecasters. The Missouri River is forecast to remain at record or near-record levels from south of Omaha all the way to Atchison, Kansas, into next week. The flooding is affecting communities in Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri. CNN's Patrick Oppmann and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: Nuclear regulator tours plants along the swollen Missouri River .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Blake Mycoskie founded TOMS Shoes in 2006. The socially responsible company aims to provide impoverished children with shoes in a sustainable way. Blake Mycoskie says he pursued his vision for TOMS Shoes with ""reckless ambition."" The California-based entrepreneur shares some of the lessons he learned along the way. Follow these tips and you too could launch the next big thing. Follow your passion . Despite having no background in fashion, Mycoskie relentlessly pursued his vision for TOMS. ""I had absolutely no experience in shoes or fashion so I approached the business how I have done everything in my life, and that's with reckless ambition,"" he says. He set out to learn how to make shoes and often spent weekends peddling the shoes to L.A.'s trendy spots in the early days of the company -- an effort that paid off. Establish smart partnerships . Partnerships are critical to spreading the TOMS model and creating a global brand that's known for giving, according to Mycoskie. He wants other firms to realize they can establish a ""one-for-one"" giving model through partnerships ""instead of reinventing the wheel themselves."" His goal is to expand the TOMS model and work with ""other great companies out there that are already doing great products."" Be flexible in your thinking . Mycoskie wanted to provide children in need with shoes, but was concerned a charity would not be sustainable. He could raise money from his friends and family, but worried about what would happen if his donors decided to contribute to another cause one year. But he found a solution by blending philanthropy with business. He says: ""I thought to myself, 'Okay, how can I guarantee these kids that they'll have shoes over and over again?''' ""The only way I could guarantee that was to start a business."" Know when to move on . One of his early ventures was a 24/7 reality TV channel, which he started up after appearing on ""The Amazing Race."" But two years after launching, the company faced stiff competition from media titan Rupert Murdoch. ""That really taught me a valuable lesson in business: Even if you have a great idea, the market is there and the market is right,"" Mycoskie says. He ended up shutting down the network, Reality Central, after realizing he couldn't compete with such a large player. ""You really have to look at who your competitors are. You can't compete with the biggest guy. The biggest guy has the ability to shut you down -- it's a really risky proposition."" Experience pays off . Mycoskie had already started four other businesses by the time he got the idea for TOMS. He says the experience of running those companies helped prepare him for the rapid growth of TOMS.

"(CNN) -- Attorneys representing families whose homes were built with toxic drywall say they will not advise their clients to accept a proposed $55 million settlement without first having several ""fundamental questions"" answered. In a conference call Friday, plaintiffs' attorneys Victor Diaz and David Durkee claimed Miami-based Banner Supply is withholding essential information that would allow their clients to make informed decisions about whether or not to accept the proposed settlement. ""They refuse to tell us what assets Banner has ... As far as we know the company itself is contributing nothing to this settlement and they won't tell us how many people are going to split up this money,"" Diaz said.  ""If this really were a good settlement, there would be complete transparency of all of the facts so that consumers can make an informed decision."" Attorney's representing Banner Supply could not be reached by CNN Monday. Homeowners involved in the suit have until the end of August to opt out of the proposed settlement. The plaintiffs' attorneys claim more than 32% of settlement money could go towards paying attorney fees -- possibly leaving their clients as little as $4,000 each to rebuild their homes. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has received more than 3,000 reports from residents of 42 states who alleged the drywall contributed to severe health issues, including chronic sinus and upper respiratory problems. The homeowners also claim the drywall corroded metals in home appliances and fixtures throughout their homes. In 2009, the product safety commission determined the drywall emits extraordinarily high levels of hydrogen sulfide and recommended that homes be completely gutted and electric components replaced. In court documents, Banner Supply has said it ""had no knowledge"" the drywall was defective and that the Chinese-based manufacturer that provided Banner with the material is at fault. Homeowner Ricardo Dabalsa of Florida said what should have been a dream home for his wife and three children turned out to be a traumatizing nightmare. Dabalsa said his family moved into their custom-built home in December of 2006 and almost immediately noticed something was wrong. His children started getting sick, and within three years of living there, the air conditioning unit had to be replaced four times along with the microwave and the family computer. But the toll it took on his family was far greater. Their youngest daughter, Nicole, was hospitalized more than 20 times before they moved out of the house. Doctors said she suffered from acute respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis, but Dabalsa said she'd never been sick with asthma before. ""We spent Christmas of 2007 and New Year's Eve in the hospital with Nicole for pneumonia and bronchitis,"" Dabalsa's wife, Aliuska, said. ""It affected me a lot ... I couldn't sleep at night."" Dabalsa learned of the toxic drywall in 2009 and immediately decided to replace the drywall throughout the house. Though he hasn't decided if he will accept the terms of the proposed settlement, Dabalsa said no amount of money will make amends for what his family has suffered. ""For what we went through, honestly, it's never gong to be about money,"" Dabalsa said. ""The house is safe now but if we smell something bad in the house, we're scared.  If my child or my kids get a cold we worry ... it's really scary.""","Banner Supply has agreed to a $55 million proposed settlement .
