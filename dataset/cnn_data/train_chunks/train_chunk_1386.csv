"Randolph Sanders, 36, confessed to shooting his supervisor at a bus stop in Philadelphia . A man confessed to shooting his supervisor dead at a bus stop so she couldn't report him for stealing money from the child advocacy organization where they worked. Kim Jones, 56, suspected Randolph Sanders, 36, was stealing from Turning Points for Children, homicide Capt. James Clark said. Fearing Jones would report him, Sanders allegedly decided to kill the mother-of-two. He apparently knew her morning routine and followed her for more than an hour before shooting her in the back of the head at a bus stop January 13, Clark said. In the days after the shooting, police released surveillance video that showed the killer, dressed in black and carrying a duffel bag, walking up to Jones as she leaned against a wall waiting for the bus. It was hard to identify the man as he pointedly made sure he did not look at any surveillance cameras. Investigators pieced together the killer's movements from surveillance video in the area, Clark said. Grieving colleagues, including Sanders, at Turning Points for Children publicly spoke of the heartless killing. 'We're just stunned. Just stunned. Just stunned,' Sanders calmly told WPVI-TV just after her death. Eventually, they managed to track the killer to a vehicle which provided a link to Sanders, a law enforcement source told Philly.com. Using surveillance tapes, investigators methodically traced the killer's path to and from the crime scene . Police were at unable even to see the killer's face - he made sure it could be not be seen on  security cameras . Police believe this photo shows Randolph Sanders, getting on to the subway after allegedly shooting his supervisor . Sanders worked under Jones, as assistant director of the child advocacy organization, CEO Mike Vogel said. Jones, the program's director, had hired Sanders as its assistant director in 2012, the sources said, and had recently come to believe he had misappropriated a significant amount of money from the program, reports Philly.com. Sanders of Philadelphia, confessed to investigators Sunday, Clark said. He was arraigned early Monday on murder and firearms charges and ordered held without bail pending a February 18 preliminary hearing. Online court records didn't list information on his lawyer.

"In the near future our cars, trains and planes could be powered by hydrogen produced by bacteria that survives in the most extreme conditions on Earth. Scientists 'accidentally' discovered a bacterium under conditions of extremely high saline and alkaline levels. These conditions, in theory, could be replicated in an industrial setting to produce the biofuel on a large scale. Biological scientists have discovered a bacterium, known as Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans (pictured) that produces hydrogen under high saline and alkaline conditions. These conditions, in theory, could be replicated in industrial settings to produce the biohydrogen fuel on an large scale . Dr Melanie Mormile, professor of biological sciences at Missouri University of Science and Technology discovered the bacterium Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans in Soap Lake, Washington. It is termed as extreme bacterium, or an ‘extremophile’ - a microorganism that lives in conditions of extreme temperature, acidity, alkalinity or chemical concentration. During tests, the researchers found that the bacterium produces hydrogen under saline and alkaline conditions in amounts that rival genetically modified organisms. The bacterium also produced an organic compound known as 1, 3-propenediol. Hydrogen produced by living organisms is called biohydrogen and is a type of fuel, similar to bio-diesel or bio-gas. Biofuels can be taken from food crops, known as ‘first generation biofuels’, waste, known as ‘second generation’, and microbes, referred to as ‘third’ or ‘advanced’ generation biofuels. Biohydrogen is an example of an advanced biofuel. Extracting third-generation biofuels is beneficial because it doesn’t impact on food production, or costs, and is said to be around 10 times more efficient as capturing sunlight compared to waste. This means that smaller areas of land are needed to produce the same amount of fuel. This compound can be used in industrial products including adhesives, laminates and coatings. Itis also a solvent and can be used as antifreeze. Living in such a hostile environment, Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans is said to have ‘metabolic capabilities’ under similar conditions seen at some contaminated waste sites. The work builds on Dr Mormile’s previous research into the bacterium from 2012. Hydrogen has a very high energy density, three times that of petrol or diesel, and it produces water as a byproduct. It can also be used in fuel cells that are said to be twice as efficient as combustion engines. Hydrogen isn’t an energy source in its own right, however. Instead, it carries energy from other types of renewable sources including the sun and the wind, as well as water. In particular, hydrogen produced by living organisms is called biohydrogen and is similar to bio-diesel or bio-gas. Biofuels can be taken from food crops, known as ‘first generation biofuels’, waste, known as ‘second generation’, and microbes, referred to as ‘third’ or ‘advanced’ generation biofuels. Biohydrogen is an example of an advanced biofuel, and it is already be taken from algae and bacteria, for example. Experts from Missouri University of Science and Technology discovered the bacterium Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans in Soap Lake, Washington (marked). The bacterium also produced an organic compound known as 1, 3-propenediol used in industrial products, and can be used as antifreeze .

This means that smaller areas of land are needed to produce the same amount of fuel. The discovery of the biohydrogen produced by Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans was made by accident while studying extremophiles found in Soap Lake, Washington. Dr Mormile said she became interested in bacteria in the region because of its potential to clean up the environment. In particular, Dr Mormile expected to find an iron-reducing bacterium and describe a new species. Instead, she found this species that can produce hydrogen and 1, 3-propanediol under high pH and salinity conditions that might turn out to be valuable industrially. ‘Usually, I tend to study the overall microbial ecology of extreme environments, but this particular bacterium has caught my attention,’ Dr Mormile said. ‘I intend to study this isolate in greater detail.’ ‘It would be great if we got liters and liters of production of hydrogen. 'However, we have not been able to scale up yet.’ The infrastructure isn’t currently in place for hydrogen to replace gasoline, but, continued Dr Mormile, if hydrogen becomes an alternative to gasoline, Halanaerobium hydrogeniformans, mass-produced on an industrial scale, could be a viable solution. The findings are published in Frontiers in Microbiology.","Experts found Halanaerobium hydrogeninformans in  Washington .

"For a second, it looked like Jermaine Kearse would lead the Seattle Seahawks to a spectacular victory with one of the craziest catches in Super Bowl history. But while the 24-year-old  wide receiver used every part of his body to make the unbelievable bobbling catch late in the fourth quarter of the game - it wasn't enough to see off the New England Patriots. In the final minutes of the game, quarterback Russell Wilson was moving the Seahawks down the field in a bid to erase a four-point deficit. Scroll down for video . Wide receiver Jermaine Kearse made one of the craziest catches in Super Bowl history but it wasn't enough to secure victory for the Seattle Seahawks . Late in the fourth quarter, Kearse used every part of his body to make the unbelievable bobbling catch which was tipped by New England Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler . Wilson entered the two-minute warning in New England territory and threw a deep pass to Kearse down the right sideline. It was well defended by Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler, who tipped the ball. But Kearse refused to let the ball touch the ground - and an incredible circus catch saw him juggle the ball four times before bringing it under his control, bringing the Seahawks to the one-yard line. Sadly, any hope of victory was soon dashed when Wilson threw an interception a couple of plays later to end the game 28-24. Kearse wrote on Twitter: 'Tough loss today but so grateful for the opportunity and so appreciative of my teammates.' He added: 'This team is special and blessed to be a part of it.' The New England Patriots sealed their win when rookie Malcolm Butler intercepted a pass from Wilson at the New England end zone in the final seconds of the game. The 24-year-old took to Twitter to express his disappointment, but added he is 'grateful' to be part of the team .

"If he plans to run for president, Jeb Bush is going to have to get a little more creative with his campaign website's name. That's because a gay couple from Portland bought the domain JebBushforPresident.com in 2008, and they have no plans to sell it to the current front-runner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. CJ Phillips and Charlie Rainwater, who describe themselves as a 'high tech bears' and a 'couple of nerds', will use the site as a platform to educate their friends and families about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues, they told Business Insider. Portland couple CJ Phillips and Charlie Rainwater (pictured) bought the domain JebBushforPresident.com in 2008 and plan to use the site as a platform to educate people on issues affecting the LGBT community . This is what you see when you visit www.JebBushforPresident.com . Mr Phillips said the couple originally planned to blog about their opinions on various national and international legislation affecting people in the LGBT community, and decided to hold on to the site as their rights continued to be challenged. 'We didn't see LGBT equality getting any better, and we felt said rights would more than likely still be in the spotlight in the run-up for the next several election cycles,' he said. 'Jeb's name was already being bandied about in the news as a potential presidential candidate, and we felt sure he'd be running in a future election.' The site is currently running with a 'Work in Progress' page that promises more to come and, under the subhead 'positive dialogue to drive positive change', reads: 'Hi there, and welcome to the page. CJ and Charlie are two guys in a great relationship who are looking to inform our friends and family about some of the challenges we face being part of the LGBT community. The couple said they bought the site because they saw their rights continually being challenged and 'felt sure' Bush (pictured) would be 'running in a future election' 'This page is intended to prompt understanding, insight, and healthy dialogue in the ever changing landscape of civil rights and social justice. Now we just need to find some time!' Bush publicly announced in December he was exploring the possibility of running a presidential campaign, and seemed to receive a boost last week when 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney said he would not run again. The former Florida governor's stance on LGBT issues has changed in the last 20 years. Bush was fiercely against gay rights in 1994, arguing in an editorial published by the Miami Herald that gay couples did not deserve legal protection. In the same article, Bush said that 'sodomy' should be not be elevated 'to the same constitutional status as race and religion'. Bush's rhetoric has shifted recently, arguing last month that same-sex marriage is a 'state issue' and 'we have to respect the rule of the law'. In a written statement, Bush said 'we can also show respect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian issue', including 'couples making lifetime commitments to each other' and 'those of us who believe marriage is a sacrament'. Although Bush has not announced an official bid for the Republican nomination, Mr Phillips said multiple people have reached out to the couple attempting to buy the domain - including one person who wanted to purchase the site for a friend's birthday gift. A spokeswoman for Bush did not respond to an email from Business Insider asking if he has made any attempt to purchase JebBushForPresident.com.

"David Cameron today refused to answer a maths question - in case he got it wrong. The Prime Minister backed plans for every child to be tested on their times table when they leave primary school. But he ducked a question on what is nine times eight, hours after Education Secretary Nicky Morgan also insisted: 'I'm not going to answer any maths questions.' Prime Minister David Cameron took part in a science lesson, during a visit to Kingsmead School in Enfield, London, but he ducked out of answering maths questions . The Tories have declared  'war on illiteracy and innumeracy' as part of a new Conservative drive to improve standards. Headteachers who fail to ensure the standards are met face being sacked if the Tories Conservatives are returned to power. As well as demonstrating mathematical skills, pupils will have to pass a writing test by showing they can use 'accurate punctuation, spelling and grammar'. By the time they leave primary school all 11 year-olds will be able to read a novel, write a short story and recite their times tables up to 12. But Mr Cameron ducked a maths challenge when answering questions following a speech in north London. Asked by 5 News political editor Andy Bell to calculate nine times eight, Mr Cameron responded: 'I'm going to plead the Nicky Morgan defence, which is I do times tables only in the car with my children on the way to school. 'I'm going to stick to that just in case I get one wrong on your excellent television programme.' Education Secretary Nicky Morgan insisted every 11-year-old should know their times tables, but ducked a maths question on TV . Earlier Mrs Morgan insisted it was needed to prepare pupils for later life but turned bashful when put on the spot BBC Breakfast. Laughing as she realised her times tables were about to be put to the test, she said: 'If it's going to be a times table question then the answer is going to be the same as I have given all the other interviewers this morning, which is I think that actually children at home are going to want to say 'I know better than the Education Secretary'. They can do that. 'I'm not going to answer any maths questions. I've made that very clear.' She also dodged the question when appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'No I'm not going to be answering any because at the end of the day I know what it's like with all these interviews, I will be doing lots of interviews this morning and there'll be one where I get it [the answer] wrong and that's the one that everyone is going to be focussing on. 'We are going to have a number of years to make sure we get our young people ready and able to answer those questions.' Questioned by presenter Bill Turnbull, Mrs Morgan said: 'I'm not going to answer any maths questions. I've made that very clear' In 1998 Labour's schools standards minister Stephen Byers was asked: What is seven times eight. He declared it (wrongly) to be 54 - having just called for pupils to learn their times tables back in 1998. Last year Chancellor George Osborne ducked exactly the same question when pressed on television by an inquisitive seven-year-old, saying that he had made it a rule in life 'not to answer a whole load of maths questions'. In 2013 Sports Minister Helen Grant could not get a single right answer when she faced a series of on-air questions about football, rugby, tennis and the Paralympics. Asked who the FA Cup holders were. A slightly anxious-looking Mrs Grant said: 'Come on, help,' before replying: 'Manchester United because it's my favourite club.' The correct answer was Wigan Athletic. And David Cameron could not come up with the answer to one of the most basic question of all - what is the price of a loaf of bread - having to fall back on the excuse that he made his own using an electronic bread-maker. But she insisted that it was right to carry out tests on pupils before they leave primary school. She told BBC Breakfast: 'We want every child to have the best start in life, and obviously that means getting it right from primary right the way through to secondary. 'This is not about saying heads will automatically be replaced. This is about saying where a school doesn't have the capacity to improve itself - and many do - or where they don't have a plan to lead that school to being rated good or outstanding, which I think is what we want for all of our children, then yes ... one of the answers is to get new leadership in. 'But there are some fantastic headteachers up and down this country who would be going and offering support to those schools and their heads.' She said the policy would foster 'collaboration' between schools to produce the best results. 'Education can be life-transforming, and that means we have to give every child the best possible start in life to fulfil their potential.' Mrs Morgan said that 'just enough is not good enough' for pupils, and insisted the policy would help British schools 'compete with the best in the world'. Since replacing Michael Gove as Education Secretary last summer, Mrs Morgan has studiously avoided putting her academic abilities to the test on camera. Last year she was asked by a 10-year-old pupil a 10-year-old pupil what the cube root of 125 is. But she laughed it of saying: 'I think it is probably better that politicians don't do maths or spelling on air.'","Prime Minister insists he only does times times when driving in the car .

"Carole White is widely considered to be the most successful model agent in the world. The  64-year-old founder of Premier Model Management managed some of the biggest supermodels of the nineties, including Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer and Linda Evangelista. But despite the UK providing some of the best talent of the era, Carole claims that the country is unlikely to be responsible for creating any more of the top names in the industry because we're lazy and eat too much. Scroll down for video . Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington at the Versace fashion show in Milan in 1991. At that time, the supermodels could command up to £300,000 for a job according to Premier Model Management co-founder Carole White, who has now written a tell-all book about her experiences managing the most beautiful women in the world in the1990s . She told Giles Hattersley from Sunday Times Style magazine: 'The British are s**t. Even if they're from a poor background, British girls have everything. 'They come from, say, Newcastle, and they don't want to leave their mates or their boyfriend — they're torn. '(And) We're not as fit. Maybe we eat too much.' The Londoner is equally dismissive of the likes of Kendall Jenner, who she classes as 'short', despite standing at 5ft 8ins tall. During the interview, Carole claims that Kim Kardashian's half-sister can hardly be classed as a model and claims her attraction lies simply in her famous name, because she gives the big fashion houses exposure. Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Eva Herzigova, and Claudia Schiffer at the chanel SS96 ready-to-wear collection . As head of Premier Models, Carole has spent the last few decades looking after the world's most beautiful women, which is no easy feat. Her role was far more than just booking her clients into great advertising campaigns of catwalk shows, the the company she ran with her brother was responsible for pandering to their every whim. In her new book, 'Have I Said Too Much? My Life in and out of the Model Agency,' Carole reveals that she had to undergo a number of errands, including couriering sex toys to a suite at the Lanesborough hotel in central London late one night and sourcing llama curry for another woman as she was boarding a private jet in Milan.

Naomi Campbell  and Kate Moss at an auction for Mandela's Children Fund in Cape Town in 1998 . In 1990, one of Carole's clients Linda Evangelista claimed about her gang of supermodels: 'We don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day.' But Carole has now debunked that myth, revealing that the price for a supermodel to appear from underneath the duvet was sometimes 30 times that amount of money. In an advert for the new Vauxhall Corsa in 1992, Carole negotiated a deal for Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista and Naomi Campbell that us eye-watering even by today's standards - each woman was paid £300,000 for their part on the TV clip. But even for that amount of money, it was still a chore actually getting the girls out of bed. In an excerpt of her book shared with the magazine, Carole reveals that she used to pretend a photo-shoot was taking place two hours earlier than it was scheduled for as the models would always be at least that late getting out of bed. After a while, she had to make the start-time three hours early as the women and twigged that they were being tricked and used to lie in even later. The one exception to this rule was Claudia Schiffer, who Carole says was always on time and her easiest client to work with.

'“We’re in the car” (just out of bed, two hours late); “We’re in a traffic jam” (just got in the car, three hours late); “We broke down!” (almost there, really pushing our luck).'

"A mother has broken her silence and revealed her heartbreak about her daughter's 'horrific' death at the hands of a 'friend' she had taken pity on. Kailee Clapp's still-burning body was dumped in a cemetery by Stathis Kirkpatrick in January 2011. The 14-year-old was so badly charred she had to be identified by her dental records. He had lured her to her death by promising her a present – then stabbed her and set her alight while she was still alive. Stathis Kirkpatrick, right, was sentenced to life in prison after he killed Kailee Clapp, left, and dumped her still-burning body was dumped in a cemetery in January 2011 . Kirkpatrick was sentenced to life in prison in December 2012. He refused to explain why he killed Kailee – but gave his family the thumbs up as he was jailed. Now Kailee's mother Nora Clapp, 51, of McCook, Nebraska, has spoken out about her heartbreak. 'The truth about what had happened to Kailee was horrific. It turned out Stathis began texting her just after 3am on the night she disappeared in January 2011,' she said. 'He told my daughter he had a belated Christmas present for her, and lured her from her bed. 'One of Kailee's last text messages to him was to say she'd meet him at the top of the alley by our house. 'There Stathis attacked her, stabbing her cheek and chin. He bundled her battered body into his car and drove her to the cemetery. 'While she was still breathing, he doused her in petrol and set her on fire. Kailee was so charred she had to be identified from her dental records.' On September 6, 2012, Kirkpatrick, then 20, of McCook, Nebraska, appeared in Red Willow County District Court and pleaded 'no contest' to first degree murder. Kailee's mother Nora Clapp, 51, of McCook, Nebraska, has spoken of her heartbreak and says she doesn't understand how anyone could be 'so evil' The court was told Kailee had initially been badly mutilated. Afterwards – while still alive – she had had petrol poured on her and was then set alight. Mrs Clapp said she believed Kirkpatrick targeted her daughter because he fancied her and she was not interested. 'Imagining what she went through and how scared she must have been, was just unbearable,' she said. 'I still don't understand how anyone could be so evil. But I think Stathis was bitter Kailee had rejected him and murdered her out of spite. 'I wish she had never gone to meet him that night. But she was so friendly she probably didn't have the heart to tell him to go away. He took advantage of my girl's kindness to kill her.' Mrs Clapp told how Kailee had initially met Kirkpatrick when he was 18 and they attended the same school. He had moved to Nebraska from New Mexico. 'Kailee said he'd moved in with his aunt because he's been struggling to get along with his family in New Mexico,' she said. 'She told me, 'he hasn't had the best start in life, but he's a great person'. 'It was typical of her to see the good in everyone. 'But they were only friends. Kailee was dating another boy who she went to school with and who was lovely.' Mrs Clapp believes Kirkpatrick targeted her 14-year-old daughter, pictured, because he fancied her and she was not interested . One Thursday evening, in January 2011, Kailee was watching television with her mother and sister Karen, now 17, when she went to bed around 10pm. Her mother checked on her later and she was asleep. It was the last time she saw her daughter. 'Karen said she wasn't in bed,' Mrs Clapp said. 'I called her mobile but it was switched off. 'I was frantic and called the police. They immediately searched for her. But the hours ticked by and there was no news. 'I went to Kailee's school and began questioning the kids in her class. No-one seemed to have a clue. 'While I was walking home, I was passing an alleyway near our house when I froze – I noticed blood stains on the ground and I instinctively knew it was Kailee's blood.' 'I felt sick with dread as I phoned the police.' Mrs Clapp said she told police: 'It's Kailee's blood.' But it was hours before they had news. Kailee's body had been found in a cemetery 20 miles from her home, mutilated and torched. 'Police told me they'd arrested Stathis in connection with Kailee's disappearance. 'I was so confused. I didn't know what he had to do with her disappearance. 'The next few months were torture. The police couldn't tell us why Stathis was suspected of murdering Kailee. Mrs Clapp, pictured center, said the family remember Kailee, left, everyday, but added: 'Our family will never be the same again' 'Some of her friends had a theory about why he might have done it. They told me Stathis had a crush on Kailee but she told him he wasn't interested.' Mrs Clapp said she remembers Kailee every day, but added: 'Our family will never be the same again.' She said: 'We think about Kailee every day and talk about constantly. 'Last summer, Karen graduated from high school. In her speech, she told her classmates about her little sister. ''She was my best friend. She'll always be with me.' 'Now, every year on the anniversary of Kailee's death, we hold a candlelit vigil for her in the park. 'Kailee's death has left an empty hole in my heart. But I'm determined to keep her memory alive.'","Stathis Kirkpatrick dumped Kailee Clapp's burning body in a cemetery .

Scroll down for video . Spoof success: Snickers' Super Bowl ad saw actor Danny Trejo star in a Brady Bunch spoof . Emotional: This image provided by Anheuser-Busch shows Budweiser's advert focusing on a lost puppy . WINNERS . The Snickers commercial recreated the famous Brady Bunch episode in which the oldest daughter, Marcia, gets hit in the nose with a football. Actor Danny Trejo played Marcia, looking to get 'eye for an eye' revenge, until she was handed a Snickers bar, and also saw a cameo from  Steve Buscemi. Budweiser chose to stick to the undeniably winning formula of cute puppies and horses. The advertisement showed a puppy chase after the iconic Budweiser Clydesdales that are being moved to a new stable, after which the horses help the little Labrador finds its way back home. All to the tune of an acoustic cover of The Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles). As always, celebrity appearances were a recurring theme during the advertisements, with Lindsay Lohan and Bryan Cranston, who appeared as his Breaking Bad character Walter White, starring in a commercial for Esurance. The ad-breaks also saw Liam Neeson performing for Clash of Clans, Kim Kardashian taking selfies for T-Mobile, Pierce Brosnan driving a Kia and Jeff Bridges chanting for SquareSpace's Power Of Om ad. Dream world: Mindy Kaling appeared in a less-controversial ad for Nationwide in which she discovers she is invisible to everyone else . We've all thought about it: Mindy uses her newfound invisibility to walk through a car wash . You can see me? Mindy discovers she is indeed visible when she tries to kiss Matt Damon . Valentine's Day promotion: Meanwhile, fast food chain McDonald's declared it will randomly select customers who can pay for their food with acts of goodwill, such as calling their moms and telling them they love them . Making it happy: Coca-Cola stood out with an anti-bullying message . Another notable ad, for insurance company Nationwide, saw actress Mindy Kaling 'discovering' she is invisible. She steals ice cream from a supermarket, sits naked in Central Park and walks through a car wash. However, when she tries to kiss actor Matt Damon, she finds she is not invisible at all. The two Esurance ads showed Lohan being a 'sorta' mom and Cranston's Walter White being a 'sorta' pharmacist to show when it comes to car insurance 'sorta' doesn't cut it. McDonald's ad surrounds a promotion in which it will randomly select customers to pay for their orders with acts of love, like a high-five or a call to a relative. The promotion starts Monday and runs through Valentine's Day. LOSERS . Weight Watchers tried, but failed, to deter Americans from gluttony by showing a big-brother like montage of, doughnuts, pizza and super-sized hamburger meals with an ominous voiceover saying 'You gotta eat, right?'. The goal was to promote its weight loss services, but some thought that the message was lost. 'Some people are saying it made them want to eat more than anything,' said Charles Taylor, marketing professor at the Villanova School of Business in Pennsylvania. Although Nationwide provided one of the funniest spots of the Super Bowl with it's Mindy Kaling ad, it was overshadowed by their second advertisement, which caused social media meltdown. The 'dark' and 'depressing' commercial tells the tale of a young boy who dies in a preventable accident. In the advert, the cherub-faced child talks about all the milestones he will miss out on after dying in an accident, including learning to ride a bike, receiving 'cooties' from a girl and getting married. In a voice brimming with hope and potential, he says: 'I'll never learn to ride a bike or get cooties. I'll never learn to fly or travel the world with my best friend. And I won't ever get married.' Speaking directly to the camera, he finishes: 'I couldn't grow up. Because I died from an accident.' Message lost: Many people said that instead of deterring them from eating, the Weight Watchers commercial had made them hungry . More sad: Nissan returned to the Super Bowl after 18 years with an ad featuring the story line of an up-and-coming race driver and his wife struggling to balance work and raising their son . How to lose weight? A tagline said Weight Watchers can help members take control of their diet . Under fire: Nationwide Insurance has sparked outrage after showing a 'depressing' and 'tragic' commercial about a young boy (pictured in the advert) who died in a preventable accident during the Super Bowl XLIX . Missed experiences: In the advert, the child talks about all the life achievements he will miss out on after dying in a household accident, including riding a bike, getting 'cooties' from a girl and getting married . Sarcastic: Rob Fee, from Louisville, Kentucky, posted the tweet (pictured): ''Hope you guys are having a great day. Did you know your kid is probably gonna die soon? Enjoy your nachos & funeral planning!' - Nationwide . A haunting image of an overflowing bathtub that presumably killed the boy then fills the screen, alongside the words: 'The number one cause of childhood deaths is preventable accidents.' Within seconds of the advert airing on Saturday thousands of people globally had taken to social media to express their disgust. Rob Fee, from Louisville, Kentucky, tweeted: ''Hope you guys are having a great day. Did you know your kid is probably gonna die soon? Enjoy your nachos & funeral planning!' - Nationwide.' In response to the criticism, Nationwide said the sole purpose of the 30-second commercial was to incite conversation and raise awareness of the issue of preventable childhood deaths. And the commercial certainly got people talking - landing itself the title of the most-mentioned advertiser on social media during the Super Bowl, according to  Amobee Brand Intelligence. Of its nearly 250,000 mentions during the game, almost two-thirds (64 per cent) were negative, 24 per cent were neutral and just 12 per cent were positive, Business Insider reported. Meanwhile, Nissan returned to the Super Bowl after 18 years with an ad featuring the story line of an up-and-coming race driver and his wife struggling to balance work and raising their son. The Japanese car giant was accused of tugging at heart-strings without referring to the actual product - the vehicle. 'Mawkish, sentimental, unimaginative, confusing – and what does it have to do with Nissan?,' The Guardian asked. In a jarring detail that many on social media pointed out, the commercial was set to 'Cats in the Cradle' by Harry Chapin, who was killed in a car crash. 'There has been an awful lot of stuff tugging at the heart strings,' said John Maxham, chief creative officer of DDB Chicago. 'I'm struck at how many brands have gone with a serious almost socially minded tone to their advertising.' Serious nature: Carnival had a voiceover by John F. Kennedy speaking lyrically about the sea, while Procter & Gamble's ad for its Always products (pictured) brand tried to redefine what it means to 'do things like a girl' The sea: This picture shows a still shot from Carnival's commercial featuring a voiceover by John F Kennedy . En-chanting: Jeff Bridges worked on his chanting for SquareSpace's Power Of Om ad . Spoof ad: Kim Kardashian did what she does best, took a lof of selfies . OTHERS . Nationwide Insurance's commercial was not the only serious advert to run during the major sporting event, which was watched by more than 100million people worldwide. 'There has been an awful lot of stuff tugging at the heart strings,' said John Maxham, chief creative officer of DDB Chicago. 'I'm struck at how many brands have gone with a serious almost socially minded tone to their advertising.' Carnival featured a voiceover by John F. Kennedy speaking lyrically about the sea, while Procter & Gamble's ad for its Always products brand tried to redefine what it means to 'do things like a girl'. Shortly after the latter ad aired, the hastag #LikeABoy started trending as men tried to counter the campaign, with many deeming it sexist and exclusionary. Meanwhile, a public service announcement by coalition No More depicted a chilling 911 call from a battered woman to demonstrate the terror of domestic abuse. The serious themes are believed to have been an effort to win over Americans who have a lower tolerance for crass ads with an overuse of sexually explicit themes and sophomoric humor. No one-trick pony: Retired football player Emmitt Smith showed his linedancing skills in a Wix.com advert . Fanny pack fun: A couple in the Loctite glue ad showed how to #winatglue . Most-mentioned ad: Nationwide's sad ad landed itself the title of the most-mentioned advertiser on social media during the Super Bowl, according to Amobee Brand Intelligence . They were a continuation of a trend that started last year when advertisers shied away from the tactics that had been commonplace during Super Bowl. 'The Super Bowl reflects what's happening in the country,' said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. 'Maybe in the country today we're a little more reflective and a little more pensive.' A Microsoft ad told the story of Braylon O'Neill, a boy who was born missing the tibia and fibula bones in both of his legs so he had to learn to live with prosthetic legs developed by Microsoft. Another ad scored early. Chevrolet's spot before kickoff appeared to be a live game feed that turned into static and a blank screen, shocking some viewers. Chevrolet used the trick to show that its Colorado truck has 4G LTE Wi Fi, allowing for live game streaming in the truck. The New England Patriots beat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24.

"Volvo is developing a range of ‘self-filling’ cars that would never need to visit a petrol station. When the tank is close to empty, the car would send a message via smartphone to a mobile fuel supplier to come and top it up. The supplier would have a secure one-off code to open up the fuel cap, freeing the owner to park the vehicle and be elsewhere. Scroll down for video . Taking you car to the petrol station could become a thing of the past as Volvo are developing a range of 'self filling' cars . Volvo never officially talks about innovations and simply said ‘maybe’ when asked about the fuel idea. However, the Swedish firm’s head of technology, Klas Bendrik, told the Mail: ‘The widespread use of smartphones is unlocking new potential in what you can do connecting a car with a customer. 'The internet of things has hit the automotive industry and the widespread use of smartphones is unlocking new potential in what you can do connecting a car with a customer.’ Mr Bendrik said Volvo had already tested a system where drivers can choose to have a parcel delivered by a courier firm to their car rather than to their homes. It would be particularly useful at workplaces that do not allow employees to receive personal deliveries, he said. Some Volvo cars already allow their drivers to activate de-icers remotely from the comfort of their home. And the same cars can be made to sound their horn and flash their lights to help owners locate them in car parks. Look, no hands! Volvo technical specialist Erik Coelingh demonstrates the company's new range of driverless cars which are being tested by customers on selected roads in and around the Swedish city of Gothenburg . The firm has already announced it is working on a project to allow cars to communicate to each other. The technology would work a bit like a radar where drivers could be warned if two connected cars were driving towards each other around a blind bend. Volvo chief executive Håkan Samuelsson is also working on a project to develop self-driving cars. ‘It would be a bit like an airplane,’ he told the Mail. ‘So for complicated manoeuvres like take-off and landing the driver would be in control. ‘But for long, boring passages you could have automation and sit back, relax, read emails, and regain 30 minutes of your life you could use to spend with your family.’","Volvo is said to be in the process of developing a range of 'self-filling' cars .

"It's a mouthwatering sight; a generous and juicy burger patty wodged into a seeded bun and covered in ketchup, resting atop gooey cheese, crisp lettuce and succulent tomatoes. These pictures of perfectly fried eggs, gorgeous iced-cakes and stunning pastries all look good enough to eat - but if you do try to taste them, you'll end up with a mouthful of paint as they are actually oil paintings. The stunning hyper-realistic images of food are the work of Dutch artist Tjalf Sparnaay, who creates delicious-looking representations of everyday food. Good enough to eat: A juicy hamburger stuffed with salad and covered in ketchup and melted cheese . Iced fancy: A cake covered in yellow icing and topped with a swirl of cream and a cherry . Mr Sparnaay wrote on his website: 'My paintings are intended to enable the viewer to experience the reality again, again letting discover the essence of the object that has become so commonplace. 'I want to return to the DNA of the universal structure in all its beauty. 'I call it ""the beauty of the ordinary"".'

Sundae success: A paper umbrella perched on scipps of ice-cream in an old-fashioned sundae gladss . The artist is always looking for new and never painted images which he finds in his own environment. 'Using trivial and everyday objects I let flow back to reality again from my brush,'  he wrote. 'My intention is to give these objects a soul, a presence.' Mr Sparnaay said he aims to produce work which the viewer will find recognisable, accessible, everyday and simple. Feast for the eyes: Ham and egg roll spills out with tomatoes, lettuce and mayonnaise . He added: 'I hope my paintings will allow the viewer to re-experience reality, to re-discover the essence of the thing that has become so ordinary from its DNA to the level of universal structure, in all its beauty. 'In an image-saturated era where anything can be reproduced anywhere in unlimited quantities, it has become apparent that rare, unique, powerful images are cherished more deeply than ever before.'

"A North Dakota neighborhood is under siege by jackrabbits the size of small dogs. Residents of the community in South Fargo awake each day to  herds of up to 50 of the dead-eyed critters swarming area lawns and playgrounds like something out of a Hitchcock film. While the jackrabbits, which can weigh as much as 9 pounds, gobble up gardens, lawns and even some trees, residents are at a loss about how to control them. Scroll down for video . They're heeeeere: A North Dakota neighborhood has been besieged by wild jackrabbits, a ravenous and fast multiplying hare species . Creepy: Like something out of a Hitchcock film, the 9-pound jackrabbits congregate by the dozens in area yards and playgrounds . 'Every day, I feel like the crazy rabbit lady chasing them out of the yard where they're having a hay day,' area resident Kayla Straabe told. 'There's at least 40 to 50 everyday, and they're in our yards and by a children's park.' Straabe posted a photo to Facebook in early December, around the time the jackrabbits first appeared, that showed countless paw prints in the snow outside her home alongside the sad remnants of some flower bushes. 'Can anyone tell that there have been a million rabbits eating all of our perennials this past week?' she wrote. Kayla Straabe says she now sees some 50 of the jackrabbits at a time. When she contacted animal control, they said there was nothing they could do . Since they showed up, the rabbits have grown in numbers. And with their ability to have four litters per year of as many as nine offspring, their numbers will undoubtedly grow if nothing is done. Straabe said she contacted local animal control department, who said there was nothing they could do. The hares, they said, are wild animals and not under their jurisdiction. However, the officials apparently weren't above doling out tips on how to control the hares. 'I was told we should poison them, which I will absolutely not do,' Straabe told ABC. In addition to the concern over laying poison near a playground, the jackrabbits are close to a dog park. Original YouTube clip .

"Ombre may have been a big hair trend in 2014 thanks to super fans Vanessa Hudgens and Jessica Alba, but in the fickle world of fashion and beauty, it's already old news. The latest quirky colour trend to be trialling is pixelated hair and, as the name suggests, it involves having pixel style graphics coloured onto your locks. Pioneered in Spain by hair colourists Jose Luis Almendral, Marco Antonio Restrepo, and Jorge Cancer of Madrid’s X-presion Creativos, the look is making waves on social media. Scroll down for video . A new Pixelated hair colouring trend is making waves in the beauty world after three Spanish hairdressers created it - beauty giant Revlon recreated the look for its campaign, pictured . The trio, who dub it the 'xpresionpixel' look, posted some snaps on their Instagram page and the beauty world seemed to approve. Square blocks of colour are soaked into the hair, before being blended and cascaded into one another to create the graphic effect. The colouring technique can either be subtle, using tones similar to your natural hair colour, or much more daring using clashing neon shades. According to Buzzfeed, the technique is infiltrating salons in Spain, London and New York. In fact, beauty giant Revlon recreated the look for its campaign. The latest quirky colour trend involves having pixel style graphics coloured onto your locks . Speaking about the new trend, Rebecca Counsel, Art Director, HARE&BONE, said: 'The Pixelated Colour placement has been a growing trend in the hair industry for some months now. Colour is fast becoming one of the key style areas to really experiment with your look and create something individual. This colour trend is almost an evolution from ombre and the pastel tones that have been here, there and everywhere; we’re all becoming much more adventurous when it comes to colour which is really exciting. 'For me, the look is really inspired by digital prints and kaleidoscopic patterns on the catwalk for SS15 – from Elie Saab to Gareth Pugh. The structure of the pixelated placements also link back to 1970s video games which were an inspiration for Vivienne Westwood’s MAN SS15 collection. 'This look works best on short, straight and structured styles where movement and texture are minimal, that way you can really show off the colour and detail. I would also highly recommend playing with a trend like this that’s so transitional in the fringe area, that way it’s more of a temporary technique that can be grown out easily. For colour, suitability and placement I would recommend speaking to a professional colour technician and do not try to create this look at home!'. Pioneered in Spain by hair colorists Jose Luis Almendral, Marco Antonio Restrepo, and Jorge Cancer of Madrid's X-presion Creativos salon, the look is gaining momentum . Amy Fish, Colourist at George Northwood, added: 'This is for those cool kids who are a little bit over pink and blue dip dye and want to try something a bit more effective. It's not for everyone's hair type, and will look best when the hair is straight.' In other hair news, hacials - or hair facials - are taking off in salons. Nioxin have launched Dermabrasion services for the scalp, which promise to remove build-up and restore the condition by accelerating scalp surface regeneration through exfoliation. Aveda, meanwhile, have a Healthy Hair Service whereby specialists use a camera to magnify the scalp to 600 per cent to analyse hair density and the scalp's oil levels. They then analyse the results and create a bespoke programme for your hair, which promises to leave it glossy from root to tip.

"Etan Patz's mother has described the moment she saw her son for the last time 35 years ago at his alleged killer's murder trial. Julie Patz, 72, came face-to-face with Pedro Hernandez, the former shop worker accused of killing the six-year-old boy, when she testified at Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday. She told the jury the youngster was trusting but also scared of being lost or alone and broke into tears when describing her feelings when she realized her son was missing. Her testimony is the only time she will appear in court because she cannot bear to go through the trial and be reminded of what happened. Scroll down for video . Tesitimony: Julie Patz, mother of Etan Patz, (pictured arriving at court) told said her son was 'trusting' and terrified of being alone as she took to the stand at his alleged killer's murder trial in Manhattan . Emotional: Mrs Patz (pictured with an attorney outside the New York court) broke into tears when she described the moment she realized her son was missing in May 1979. She arrived separately from other family members . She arrived at the court separately for her husband Stan, who turned up with his daughter Shira, and was not wearing a wedding ring. Mrs Patz recounted her time living in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood when her son, Etan, was little. Etan disappeared on May 25, 1979 — the first time he walked to school alone. 'That was the last time I saw him. I watched him walk one block away. I turned around and went back upstairs and that was the last time.' Etan had asked his mother if he could walk to catch the school bus on his own. She initially said no but capitulated. On the day he went missing she told him to go straight to the bodega and get a drink with money he had been saving up. 'I reminded him to come directly home from school, no side trips anywhere,' she said. She told the court how the store, where Hernandez worked as a youngster, was dark, dirty and poorly stocked. However because of the location other parents in the neighborhood would often tell the children to meet there in an emergency. Etan Patz's mother Julie, center, described the moment she saw her son for the last time 35 years ago at the murder trial of his alleged killer Pedro Hernandez, right . Hernandez said in his videotaped confession that he lured the youngster into the basement of the store and strangled him. His parents were looking after two other toddlers that morning - their two-year-old son Ari and a neighbor's chilled. Their daughter Shira, who was eight at the time, also decided to stay home from school. The boy was 'totally outgoing and trusting of everyone — totally nonjudgmental about people,' his mother said. 'Everyone that he met once was his friend and was a nice person.' But while Etan craved independence and was eager to become a grown-up, Patz said, 'at the same time he was very fearful of being lost or left alone by himself.' Mrs Patz cried when talking about how she felt in the hours after she learned Etan was missing. 'I don't remember a thing about that night and the next day, quite honestly,' she said. She recalls only having 'very rubbery legs,' an upset stomach and difficulty walking, thinking and talking. Family support: Shira Patz, Etan's sister (center) and Stan Patz, his father, arrive at court for the second day of Pedro Hernandez's trial . Justice for Etan: Pedro Hernandez (left), pictured in 2012, is standing trial for the 1979 kidnapping and murder of the six-year-old who disappeared on his way to school in 1979 . 'Our home became police headquarters. Global command. It was very strange.' 'It was not fun,' she added. 'Our children were handed off to neighbors and friends because our house was a madhouse. It’s been more like a circus than anything else.' Asking questions from prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, she said women in her neighborhood criticized her for playing and laughing with her children just months after Etan vanished - suggesting she was somehow involved. She also became emotional when she started describing the impact the case which has spanned three decades has had on her children. 'My daughter and my son, this has been almost their entire lives,' she said. 'It's very difficult to continuously try to regain a sense of normalcy in your daily life (while having it) constantly being pulled out from under you with new developments in the case, new leads or whatever,' she said. She then spoke about the role she played in pushing the issue of missing children into the spotlight, saying she initially hadn't meant for it to happen. 'This was not my intention, but the opportunity arose as more and more parents of missing children called me and asked me, 'How do you do it? How do you keep going?'' she said. 'I would talk to them. I started doing talk shows around the country, both to encourage political change in how this country addressed missing children.' After the coverage surrounding her son's disappearance died down in the 1980's she shied away from the spotlight. Her husband Stan started making most of the appearances in public. She has only been seen at a handful of court dates. Donna Cornachio, a professor of journalism at Purchase College,  also took to the stand. She was helping Mrs Patz run her daycare when Etan went missing. Julie Patz's testimony is the only time she will appear in court because she cannot bear to go through the trial and be reminded of what happened . A look back: In this March 17, 1980, photo, Stan and Julie Patz stand on the second-floor fire escape of the of their loft in the SoHo neighborhood of New York. Below them runs Prince Street, along which Etan, their six-year-old son, set off to school on May 25, 1979, never to return . She told the court that the mother started panicking on the day and said over and over: 'Etan should be home by now. Etan should be home by now.' Hernandez was a teenage shop worker in 1979 when New York police jotted down his name among those of many people they met during their feverish search. But it wasn't until 2012 that Hernandez emerged as a suspect. The apparent breakthrough in the case was based on a tip and a videotaped confession that prosecutors say was foreshadowed by remarks he made to friends and relatives in the 1980s. His defense hinges on convincing jurors that the confession is false, along with suggesting that the real killer may be a convicted Pennsylvania child molester who was a prime suspect for years. In considering evidence that reaches back to 1979, jurors will delve into a missing-child case that helped inject a new protectiveness into American parenting. Etan became one of the first missing children featured on milk cartons. His parents helped advocate for legislation that created a nationwide law enforcement framework to address such cases, and the anniversary of his disappearance became National Missing Children's Day. The trial is expected to last up to three months. In addition to Etan's mother, witnesses are expected to include psychologists, an inmate informant who knows Hernandez, and possibly other informants testifying against the earlier suspect. Account: Stan Patz (pictured walking into court on Monday) watched his wife's testimony during what is expected to be her only appearance in court during the trial . During her opening statement on Friday, Illuzzi-Orbon told the jury Etan was a 'tiny man with a big heart' who couldn't wait to walk to his school bus stop alone on the day he vanished. The speech evoked a scene from another era, a time before cell phones or laptops, when even in New York City, children 'played outside until their mothers called them home at dinner time.' 'A time when hippies, not hipsters, graced the streets of downtown Manhattan. This is the moment we're about to step back into, and into a crime that changed the face of this city forever, a cautionary tale and a defining moment, a loss of innocence,' Illuzzi-Orbon said. 'This was the moment in time when Etan Patz lived, and it's the moment in time when Etan Patz died . 'You will see and hear his chilling confession,' she added. 'What you will see is someone who very keenly controls the information that he puts out. Hernandez is 'a person who committed a horrible, unthinkable act, and then covered his tracks and lived the rest of his life ... always waiting and wondering when the day would come that his dark secret was out,' Illuzzi-Orbon added. 'Today is that day.' She also mentioned how Hernandez's ex-wife, years ago, said she found a cut-out photo of Etan in a little box where he stored keepsakes. Hernandez's brother-in-law Jose Lopez tried to alert authorities for years, the prosecutor said, calling 'America's Most Wanted,' the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the NYPD's missing-persons squad. No one got back to him until 2012, when he called again after seeing news of a failed effort to dig for clues in a neighborhood basement. Both Hernandez and Etan's father sat stock-still as the prosecutor spoke. Hernandez' wife, Rosemary, was also in the packed courtroom. In repsonse, defense attorney Harvey Fishbein told the court there is no evidence from the 1979 crime scene that implicates Hernandez.

"Police have named the five people found dead at a Georgia home on Saturday, while they continue to seek missing Thomas Jesse Lee, 26, who has been named by police as a ‘person of interest’ in the case. The dead included his wife Christie Lee, 33, her daughter Bailey Burtron, 16, her parents William Burtron, 69; and Sheila Burtron, 68, and family friend Iiaonna Green, 18, who’d only recently moved into the La Grange home. The bodies of four females and one male were found inside the LaGrange home shortly after 10 p.m. on Saturday. Police are seeking Thomas Lee, right, after they discovered five dead bodies at a Georgia home on Saturday night including Lee's wife Christie, center, and her daughter Bailey . The dead also included Christie Lee's parents Shelia Burtron, 68, and William Burtron, 69 . The bodies were discovered after someone called 911, asking for deputies to check on the home's occupants, said Troup County sheriff's Sgt. Stewart Smith. The 911 caller reported that he hadn't seen anyone come or go from the home in a while, Smith said. The bodies were discovered after the employer of one of the victims called 911 and said the man had not shown up for work for several days, Woodruff said. Troup County Sheriff James Woodruff speculated the slayings may have occurred on Wednesday, although the victims’ bodies would need to be transported to the state medical examiner’s office for autopsy to determine the exact time of death. After finding all the exterior doors locked, deputies used a breach kit to enter the home through a rear door. What they found was a grisly scene throughout the entire home, Woodruff said. The five bodies were found inside this LaGrange home shortly after 10 p.m. on Saturday night . Police say the bodies were found in different rooms in the home, report WSBTV.

"The model whose multimillionaire husband hired a hit man to kill her has revealed she still fears he will come back into her life. Dino Guglielmelli was jailed for nine years in June 2014 for plotting the murder of Monica Olson, his wife of almost a decade and mother of his two daughters. The lengthy court case in Los Angeles heard recorded phone calls in which Guglielmelli, a vitamin tycoon whose business greatly benefited from his wife's skin care line, said he was '100 per cent' sure he wanted Olson dead. Now, half a year later, Olson tells 48 HOURS: 'I know his intention is to reunite himself with the kids and take those children away from me. 'Do I think about it? Yes.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fears: Monica Olson, left, said she knows her ex-husband who tried to have her killed, Dino Guglielmelli, right, will try to take her kids away from her when he gets out of jail after his sentence . Whistle-blower: Hired hit man Rick Fuhrmann took recordings of phone calls with Guglielmelli to the police . She said she is fully aware of her former husband's plans: 'He wanted to make it look like a drug killing. Like I had been kidnapped in Mexico. He wanted me raped, and he wanted my head cut off. 'It's the Hunger Games; it's kill or be killed.' But in a phone call from prison, Guglielmelli told the documentary he is the victim. 'I've been criminalized, Troy,' he told 48 HOURS reporter Troy Roberts. 'It's just destroyed my life. And I don't get it, I don't understand why everyone wants to attack me, and this guy set me up.' Guglielmelli was ultimately sentenced after the court was played phone calls between him and his hired hit man Rick Fuhrmann, who went to the police. Shocked that Guglielmelli 'had it all' and still wanted to commit such an act, Fuhrmann says he deliberately stalled the operation - even pretended he had infected Olson with AIDS. He said Guglielmelli was constantly dating other women and contacted him when the marriage started to break down. Fuhrmann told the program: 'He wanted her dead and he didn't care how it was done - beat her up, cut her head off, put her in ditch.' Instead he handed in his recorded messages to the district attorney. 'Happy family': The couple had two daughters and a seemingly blissful life before it broke down . Plot: Guglielmelli, who the court heard was consistently unfaithful, hired Fuhrmann to kill Olson . One included: . Rick Fuhrmann: 'You're positive?' Dino Guglielmelli: 'That what?' Rick Fuhrmann: 'You want her dead?' Dino Guglielmelli: 'Oh, I'm...' Rick Fuhrmann: '100 percent?' Dino Guglielmelli: 'Why wouldn't I?' Rick Fuhrmann: 'Why wouldn't you? Good question.' According to Monica, Dino's mood started to change when she tried to start her own skin care line - which was ultimately a success - for he wanted her to stay at home. 'Monica is lucky because, in the end, Rick Fuhrmann is not a killer. He is someone that might bend the truth or omit the truth, but he's not a killer. And that's what saved Monica,' said Los Angeles Assistant District Attorney Emily Cole. Despite the guilty verdict, which Guglielmelli is unable to appeal, two of Dino's six older brothers are determined to defend their sibling - slamming a recorded phone call between Dino and the hit man as unconvincing. Career woman: Olson, a model with a degree in international business, said her husband's mood changed . Tearful: In court at her husband's sentencing Olson wept as she described her shock . Speaking to 48 HOURS, Gino and Emilio Guglielmelli dismissed their former sister-in-law as a 'gold digger' and said they were unconvinced by the evidence heard in Los Angeles Superior Court. 'I really didn't think anybody was going to be dead,' Gino insists, slamming a tape which purported to show Dino dealing with the hit man as flimsy proof. Emilio says of Olson: 'I didn't care for her. I thought she was a gold-digger, and had other motives.' The brothers, who grew up on a Washington State farm, describe Olson as a trophy wife. Gino said: 'She wanted her lifestyle that wasn't sitting at home. You know, her lifestyle was to go to Hollywood, and whatever they do in Hollywood. 'They had nannies ... people with the girls, you know, all day long. ... So he's probably spent more time with 'em. Because when he'd come home from work, sometimes she wouldn't come back ... until later in the evening.' Unconvinced: Emilio Guglielmelli believes his younger brother's ex-wife Olson was a 'gold digger' Last year, the brothers filed character testimonies to court for Dino, saying that he started his working life in 1984 sweeping factory floors before rising through the ranks to become an office manager in just three years. He studied for a business degree in his spare time before spending seven years as an executive for a waste disposal company. They said he cashed in $130,000 worth of stock he'd acquired in the company to start his own beauty supplements business Creation's Garden. At it's height, the firm employed 250 people, had four factories and made $48 million a year. One of the most successful lines was Monica's skin care brand. But immediately after his arrest, Guglielmelli gave his brother Gino power of attorney and filed for bankruptcy citing debts of just over $1 million. The firm, whose assets included $8 million worth of stock, was eventually sold off at auction.","Vitamin tycoon Dino Guglielmelli was caught on tape ordering a man to kill his model wife Monica Olson as their relationship broke down .

"This is the last chance saloon for the owner of The John Wayne Museum. The museum in Bowie, Maryland dedicated to the memory of one of the big screen's most recognizable actors will be forced to shut its doors if it cannot drum up some cash quickly. Bill Atkins, its owner and a real estate broker announced earlier this year that he was struggling to keep up with the $20,000 annual cost of running the museum and needed financial help. Closure: Bill Atkins, created the museum dedicated to John Wayne in part of his commercial real estate office in Bowie, when Atkins was a Marine in 1950 he was an extra in a John Wayne movie, Flying Leathernecks . Silver screen: John Wayne, pictured, was an American actor and icon because he epitomized rugged masculinity and is famous for his calm voice on screen . Portrait: A treasured portrait of the actor shows him in all of his on-screen glory wearing a familiar cowboy hat . But his posse has been unable to lasso any help so far and he will have to close the museum's doors on Sunday. Atkins told The Baltimore Sun: 'I would have been satisfied with almost anything because I don't want to move. 'I was always losing money, but I knew that. I'm just hoping something will happen, but I'm prepared to move out.' Atkins, a die hard Wayne fan opened the museum in 2006 at the Hilltop Plaza Shopping Center in Bowie. He used part of his commercial real estate office to open it. The super fan was so gung ho about showcasing the legend and his life that he never charged for admission, instead he handed out a dollar bill with Wayne's face on it to every visitor. Sadness: Atkins stands among his memorabilia in the museum, he is particularly sad that he wont be able to keep the place running because he has collected photographs of Wayne most of his adult life . Memorabilia: A porcelain John Wayne figure rests on a table in the John Wayne Museum which will close . Closure: The John Wayne Museum has reached its last roundup unless the founder can get donors . Film role: Yakima Canutt, left, and John Wayne act a scene in the film The Star Packer in 1934, Wayne starred in over 160 movies, mostly Westerns, during his career . Museum: Atkins, a die hard Wayne fan opened the museum in 2006 at the Hilltop Plaza Shopping Center in Bowie, Maryland . Atkins said: 'I've had this place for eight years. It costs me about $20,000 a year for everything, and I don't charge anything. I do it for one reason to keep the legend alive.' The real estate agent tried to generate cash himself by applying to the city for a grant and even sought corporate sponsorship. But he was unsuccessful. He is particularly sad that he wont be able to keep the place running because he has collected photographs of Wayne and memorabilia for most of his adult life. He boasts that he met the star, nicknamed 'The Duke' in 1950 while serving in the Marine Corps and was tapped to work as an extra on the set of the film 'Flying Leathernecks.' Atkins said he was one of a small group of Marines chosen to work on the film while 100 others in his battalion were sent to Korea, 15 of whom were killed in action. He credits the film for sparing him from serving in Korea, and giving him the chance to meet Wayne during his six-week stint on the set. 'He was a man's man,' Atkins said. 'He would talk to anybody at any place about anything. 'He was exactly as you saw him on the screen. He didn't have a trailer — he hung out with us.'","The museum is dedicated to the memory of the legendary actor .

"These images show the shocking injuries suffered by a 24-year-old mother who was battered in her home by her ex-boyfriend because she didn't say 'bye' to him in the pub. Victoria O'Callaghan, from Birkenhead, Merseyside, was left unrecognisable by 28-year-old Anthony Kearney after he broke into her home and savagely assaulted her for up to an hour. The assistant cook, who split with Kearney in October, was told by police that if the attack had continued for another 10 minutes she would have been killed. Horrific: Victoria O'Callaghan, 24, (left) was left unrecognisable after she was beaten by her ex-boyfriend Anthony Kearney, 28 (right) Miss O'Callaghan's former boyfriend climbed in through an upstairs window and found her sleeping next to the fire in her living room at around 5am on Boxing Day. The mother-of-one said: 'He was going mad, shouting how I didn't say bye to him. He strangled me, kicked me, and even stood on my head so I couldn't move. 'His foot was on my neck, choking me. I must have passed out then as I can't remember any more.' He even stamped on her wrist where metal pins had been  removed from the joint after a recent break. After the assault he urged her to lie to her family and pretend she had been brutally mugged while walking home.

She revealed she suffered regular violence at the hand's of her boyfriend but was too afraid to get help until their eventual split last year. 'It was the beatings that made us break up,' she said. 'He'd give me black eyes. He would drink and lose his temper. 'That's the danger of domestic violence. You don't realise when you're involved in it. I thought everyone was against him at the time.

"Pro-Russian rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine have announced plans to boost the size of their armed forces to 100,000 in a ominous sign for peace efforts in the war torn country. Alexander Zakharchenko, the leader of separatists in the state of Donetsk, said new mobilization plans aim to swell the rebels' ranks, although its not clear exactly how many fighters the rebels have now, nor how many able-bodied men are still willing and able to join them in rebel-held areas. The rebels have acknowledged that some Russian citizens are fighting among their ranks, but reject Ukraine's charge that they are getting military help from Russia. Western experts say the sheer amount of heavy weapons under rebel control shows extensive help from Moscow. News of the rebels' recruitment drive comes as fierce protests broke out in the capital Kiev, with fighters from the Aydar Ukrainian volunteer battalion burning tyres at the entrance to the Ukrainian Defence Ministry during demonstrations prevent the possible disbandment of their battalion. The volunteers are furious at the possible scaling back of Ukrainian defence forces as regime groups are already outgunned in the east of the country. This morning Ukrainian troops battled to repel waves of Russian-backed separatists trying to surround a strategic railway hub in eastern Ukraine. Elsewhere, the rebel stronghold of Donetsk came under heavy, sustained shelling once again. City authorities said that 15 civilians had been killed over the weekend in the fighting, while Ukraine authorities said five soldiers had been killed and 29 wounded overall in the east in the past day alone. Anger: News of the pro-Russian rebels' recruitment drive comes as fierce protests broke out in the capital Kiev, with fighters from the Aydar Ukrainian volunteer battalion burning tyres at the entrance to the Ukrainian Defence Ministry .

A serviceman from the volunteer battalion 'Aydar' burns tyres during a furious protest rally in front of Ukrainian Ministry of Defense . Demonstration: Servicemen from the Aydar battalion remove a national flag from the Ukrainian Defence Ministry building in Kiev . Since the unrest in eastern Ukraine surged anew in early January, the separatists have made notable strides in clawing territory away from the government in Kiev. Their main offensive is now directed at Debaltseve - a government-held railway junction once populated by 25,000 people that lies between the rebel-held cities of Luhansk and Donetsk. Almost 2,000 residents have fled in the last few days alone. Rebel forces have mounted multiple assaults on government positions in Debaltseve but all were repelled, a spokesman for Ukrainian military operations in the east, Andriy Lysenko, said today. 'The units that have arrived in support of our troops in Debaltseve are counterattacking and denying the enemy the opportunity to complete the encirclement,' he said. Separatist fighters burst through Ukrainian lines last week in the village of Vuhlehirsk on the road west of Debaltseve, getting access to a ridge overlooking the highway running north from the town.

Fighters from the Aydar Ukrainian volunteer battalion demonstrate at the entrance to the Ukrainian Defence Ministry in Kiev this morning . This morning Associated Press reporters saw Ukrainian tanks shooting from open fields at the tree line on that ridge. Minutes later, the tanks rolled back onto the highway, leaving a heavy trail of mud in their wake, and taking up new field positions a few hundred yards away. In a coordinated defensive maneuver, Ukrainian forces fired barrages from Grad multiple-rocket launchers toward the same area. Despite government's insistence it intends to retain control of Debaltseve, rows of trenches near a bridge 15 kilometers (9 miles) to the north suggested a backup plan in case the town falls. Meanwhile, the leader of the separatists in Donetsk, Alexander Zakharchenko, said new mobilization plans aim to swell the ranks of rebels to 100,000 fighters. It's not clear how many fighters the rebels have now or how many able-bodied men are still available in rebel areas. Zakharchenko did not say where he aimed to find apparently tens of thousands of troops. 'While we still have time before the spring, new detachments will be able to receive military training,' Zakharchenko said. 'We expect mobilization to yield at least five additional brigades - five motorized brigades, one artillery brigade and a tank brigade.'

In Budapest, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country will not provide weapons to Ukraine and supports negotiations and a diplomatic solution to the conflict. 'It is my firm belief that this conflict cannot be solved militarily,' Merkel said this morning. She said she prefers economic sanctions by the European Union and negotiations to 'solve or at least mitigate the conflict.' The conflict in eastern Ukraine has claimed more than 5,100 lives and forced 900,000 to flee since April. This afternoon a senior U.S. administration official claimed President Barack Obama is reconsidering sending lethal assistance to Ukraine but continues to have concerns about the effectiveness of that step and the risks of a proxy war between America and Russia. The official said Obama is specifically concerned about the besieged Ukrainian military's capacity for using high-powered, American-supplied weaponry. The president has also argued that no amount of arming the Ukrainians would put them on par with Russia's military prowess. The official requested anonymity to speak because the person was not authorized to talk publicly about internal deliberations.

The U.S. accuses Russia of supplying the pro-Kremlin separatists that are stirring instability in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. has limited its supplies to the Ukrainian military to non-lethal aid, such as gas masks and radar technology to detect incoming fire. However, some administration officials have been pressing Obama for months to step up that assistance. With violence in eastern Ukraine on the rise in recent weeks, the official said Obama is willing to take a fresh look at supplying Ukraine with lethal aid, along with other options for calming tensions. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to visit Kiev Thursday to meet with Ukrainian officials. Obama and European leaders have largely centered their efforts to stop Russia's advances on Ukraine on sanctions targeting Moscow's most profitable economic sectors, as well as individuals close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The sanctions, along with the plummeting price of oil, have hurt Russia's economy, but have done little to change Putin's calculus with regards to Ukraine. Bernadette Meehan, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said the White House is 'constantly assessing our policies in Ukraine.' 'Although our focus remains on pursuing a solution through diplomatic means,' she said, 'we are always evaluating other options that will help create space for a negotiated solution to the crisis.'

As fighting ntensified between government and rebel forces in Debaltseve, separatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that he plans to mobilize enough new volunteers to bring his forces to 100,000 men . Since the unrest in eastern Ukraine resumed, the separatists have made notable strides in clawing territory away from the government in Kiev . Since the crisis between Ukraine and Russia began early last year, the U.S.-led NATO alliance has sought to strengthen the Ukrainian military's command, control, communications and computers capabilities, as well as to improve logistics and standardization, cyber defense, military career transition and the rehabilitation of injured troops. However, NATO officials have also stressed that the alliance has no military hardware of its own. Each of the 28 member nations is free to assist Ukraine as it deems fit. Earlier today Alexander Vershbow, NATO's top-ranking American civilian official, said that Putin's actions have been a 'game-changer in European security,' and predicted the challenge from Moscow will be long-term. He said Russia was even less predictable now than during the Cold War. 'Today, we must contend with a Russia that wants to go back to a Europe based on spheres of influence and doctrines of limited sovereignty for its neighbors, policies that are a throwback to an earlier time, a time we thought we had put behind us,' Vershbow said in a speech prepared for delivery at the 2015 Leangkollen Conference in Oslo, Norway. The New York Times first reported the new Obama administration deliberations on lethal assistance.","Pro-Russian separatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko announces drive to swell rebels' ranks to 100,000 men .

"The daughter-in-law of the inventor of the iconic lava lamp drowned after falling into the River Avon while she walked her dogs. Christine Craven-Walker, 70, was found after a huge police search near her £4.5million home in Little Somerford, near Chippenham, Wiltshire. She fell into the river as she was walking the dogs, who were later found on the embankment, an inquest heard today. Christine Craven-Walker, the daughter-in-law of the inventor of the lava lamp, died after falling into a river while walking her dogs, an inquest heard . It is thought that Mrs Craven-Walker may slipped as she was trying to get her dogs out of the water. Wiltshire Police said her tragic death, on January 23, was not being treated as suspicious. Mrs Craven-Walker was the daughter-in-law of Edward Craven-Walker, who invented the lava lamp . Mrs Craven-Walker, who lived with husband Tony in a £4.5million home which they bought from entrepreneur James Dyson 10 years ago, was the daughter-in-law of Edward Craven-Walker - the inventor of the lava lamp. An inquest in Salisbury, Wiltshire, heard today that the 70-year-old's cause of death was drowning. The rural hamlet, where just 300 people live, was today in shock at Mrs Craven-Walker's death. Little Somerford parish councillor Julie Frayling said: 'People are very shocked at what has happened. 'This is a very close-knit community. 'The River Avon goes passed and indeed under her home. She had two dogs and walked them every day.' The inquest was adjourned to a date which is yet to be fixed. The lava lamp was created by British inventor Edward Craven-Walker, who was inspired by an odd-looking liquid-filled egg timer he saw in a pub in southwest Britain. The former World War II pilot then spent years transforming the concept into a home lighting accessory, having recognized the potential for such an invention during anything-goes '60s Britain. Britain's 'Love Generation' saw an affinity between the fluorescent lava flow's unpredictable nature and the easy-going, drug-induced spirit of the decade, with the iconic lamp's popularity continuing well into the 1970s. Lava lamps are based on two liquids of slightly different density which will not mix. The heavier liquid sinks to the bottom, but when heated by the lamp light its density decreases and it floats to the top. They are still made in Britain today by company Mathmos, which still employs Mr Craven-Walker's tried and tested formula.","Christine Craven-Walker, 70, drowned after falling into the River Avon .

"Bad babysitter: Larry Leroy Floyd was arrested on Saturday after allegedly trying to circumcise his 20-month-old nephew with a kitchen knife . A Florida man was arrested after he allegedly tried to circumcise his 20-month-old nephew with a kitchen knife. Larry Leroy Floyd, 24, was babysitting at his sister's house when, for reasons that are unclear, he decided to take a blade and try to slice off his nephew's foreskin, according to police. The boy's father called 911 after he returned from a shopping trip to find his son bloodied and crying, but by the time officers arrived he had already taken the child to hospital. Ocala police arrested Floyd after interviews at the scene suggested he had tried to circumcise the boy with a kitchen knife, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Sergeant Michael Sommer told the New York Daily News that another of the child's uncles was also at the home, in the troubled Spring Manor apartment complex in Ocala, but was in another room and didn't realise what was happening. 'He heard the baby crying as the father arrived (back home),' the policeman said. 'He rushed out and said your son is bleeding.' He added: 'By the time we got the call the father scooped up the child and left for the hospital.' Floyd also left the scene after telling the father he had circumcised the boy, Ocala.com reports. There have been no updates on the boy's condition but Sgt Sommer said that he expects him to recover. Most often an elective surgery on newborns for cultural and religious reasons, circumcision is generally performed by surgeons using scalpels and with the help of local or general anaesthetic. About one-third of males worldwide are circumcised, with the procedure especially popular in Israel and the Muslim world (where it is near universal), the U.S. and parts of South East Asia and Africa. The World Health Organisation recommends circumcision as part of a comprehensive HIV program in areas where the virus is epidemic, as evidence suggests it helps to reduce the risk of infection. Circumcision is also associated with reduced rates of cancer-causing forms of HPV and risk of both UTIs and penile cancer. Done correctly, it does not appear to have an effect on sexual function. Troubled: The incident happened at Ocala's Spring Manor complex, a housing development notorious with police and the scene of a number of recent shootings, two of which were fatal . Home away from home: Floyd remained in Marion County Jail on Monday morning. He has spent time there for offences including armed robbery, petty theft, drug possession, trespass, domestic violence and stalking . Ocala's Spring Manor complex is well known to police. Most recently the area has seen a number of shooting, two of which were fatal. Floyd was arrested immediately after the incident on Saturday evening and has been charged with domestic aggravated assault. He has spent time in jail for a string of previous offences, including armed robbery, petty theft, drug possession, trespass, domestic violence and stalking a child. He remained in jail on Monday morning. It wasn't known whether he has an attorney.","Larry Leroy Floyd was babysitting the boy while the father went shopping .

"Neglect: A mother who left her ten-month-old baby strapped in his pushchair for 14 hours in a urine-soaked nappy and without a feed has avoided jail . A mother who left her ten-month-old baby strapped in his pushchair for 14 hours in a urine-soaked nappy and without a feed has avoided jail after admitting neglect. The baby's father contacted social workers after he noticed while changing the child that the little boy had red abrasions on his legs caused by sitting in his own dirty nappy. The following day, both the boy and the woman's older child were taken away from their mother. Derby Crown Court heard the woman had not felt up to looking after the children because she felt 'unwell'. She admitted she had only given the children crisps and a drink each during the day. But she was handed a 12-month community order, with supervision and 100 hours of unpaid work, after pleading guilty to neglecting her children. The alarm was raised after the infant's father found two 10cm-long dark red abrasions in lines across his legs as well as areas of eczema. The injuries are believed to have been caused by 'long contact with urine-soaked nappies', . The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons but who lives in Derby, also pleaded guilty to neglecting her three-year-old child - again by not feeding it during that period. Sarah Allen, prosecuting, said: 'In interview, she accepted her son would have been in a soiled nappy and had been in the pushchair for over 14 hours and held down. She felt it was the only option because she was feeling unwell.' Miss Allen said the woman also accepted she had not fed them for that period of time - from 11pm until 1pm the following day - a period in which they had been sitting together in their living room. Miss Allen said: 'She accepted her son, by that stage, was a crawling, active baby and she accepted he would not have been happy being treated in that way but felt that there was nothing further that could have been done because she was suffering pain.' Admission: The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons but who lives in Derby, pleaded guilty to neglecting both of her children at Derby Crown Court, pictured above . Passing a community sentence Judge John Burgess said: 'Being a mother is a great responsibility. 'You are expected, both by the public and your children, to care for them and care for them properly, and you didn't - you failed both of your children. 'You failed to give them food over a significant period of time and you left one of your children strapped in a pushchair without changing his nappy for too long, and he suffered as a result.' The judge said he accepted that this had not been 'deliberate ill-treatment'. He added: 'At that particular time, you were an inadequate mother - you weren't able to cope.' He said she had been unwell but needed to understand that there were millions of mothers who felt unwell but went on to look after their children 'brilliantly'. The judge believed the main cause for the neglect was the depression she had been suffering at the time.","Father contacted social workers after finding red abrasions on baby's legs .

"Claim: Parents who beat their daughters said it was 'acceptable' in their native Nigeria (posed by model) A mother and father who beat their young daughters with phone chargers and a wooden spoon told a judge it was 'acceptable' in their native Nigeria. The couple have been spared jail despite social workers uncovering the extent of the abuse on the children - who are all aged under eight - and taking them into care for their protection. Instead the pair, who moved from Nigeria to Northampton, were handed 180 hours of unpaid work each after they admitted three charges of child cruelty at Northampton Crown Court. A judge heard they regularly hit their three daughters on the arms and legs, locked them in their rooms when they misbehaved and made one kneel with her hands in the air. The abuse went undiscovered until a routine interview at school between a social worker and the eldest girl, which was arranged because the family had arrived in Britain from another country. Prosecutor Mary Loram said the girl revealed she was regularly hit on the back with a phone charger wire, and her parents struck her with their hands on her arms and legs. The girl told social workers she was battered with a large spoon and locked in her room for long periods of when she misbehaved. 'The child said she was also made to kneel with her hands in the air for a long period of time and then punished if she let them drop,' the prosecutor added. But Kehinde Atanda, defending, said the charges had come about due to a cultural misunderstanding about 'appropriate chastisement' in Britain. He said: 'In my client's home country children are punished like this and it is acceptable.' Smack: The parents' lawyers told Northampton Crown Court (pictured) that the punishment was appropriate . Hitting a child is always treated as a crime by police, but British law allows parents to use the defence of 'reasonable chastisement' in court. That means the assault was proportionate to discipline the child - a defence which has been supported by prominent MPs including Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. He told the Mail on Sunday in 2013: 'I’m not opposed to smacking. It is to be used occasionally. Sometimes it sends a message – but I don’t hanker for the days when children were severely beaten at school.' However, all assaults on children that leave bruising, swelling, cuts or grazes have been illegal since the 2004 Children's Act. Any adult found guilty can face up to five years in jail. Judge Lynn Tayton ruled that the punishments dished out by the pair were unreasonable, but their behaviour had not been severe enough for them to be sent to jail. 'You thought you were doing the right thing; something that would happen in Nigeria,' she said. 'You thought it was appropriate chastisement.' Judge Tayton sentenced the man and woman to a community order including 180 hours of unpaid work. They were also given a three-month curfew from 7pm to 7am. The children involved have since been taken into temporary care, where they are living with foster carers and have supervised visits from their parents. It is believed the couple, who the law says must be kept anonymous to protect their children, will fight to regain custody in care proceedings later this month.","Pair in Northampton, from Nigeria, have three children under eight .

"David Cameron came under attack yesterday over his promise to protect funding for schools after it emerged his plans would see spending per pupil fall in real terms. In a major speech on education billed as an ‘all-out war on mediocrity’, the Prime Minister said every child should be able to attend a good school regardless of their postcode. But his pledge that the amount of funding per pupil would be ring-fenced in the next Parliament started to unravel as he admitted spending would not increase in line with inflation. The Prime Minister said the amount of money per child in English schools would be protected in cash terms . Instead, the amount schools receive per pupil would be frozen at the current level and the schools budget would only see a small rise because of increasing numbers of schoolchildren. By the end of the next Parliament, this would mean a cut in real terms of around 7 per cent to the schools budget for children aged between five and 16, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said Mr Cameron’s pledge represented ‘quite a watering down’ of the current arrangements, and ‘real-term falls over the next Parliament’. Speaking at a school in Enfield, North London, yesterday, Mr Cameron made his pledge not to cut the funding per child because good schools ‘need money’, adding: ‘A good education shouldn’t be a luxury – the preserve of those living within a certain postcode or those who can afford it. It should be something everyone in this country can get.’ Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'The cat is out of the bag. The government will ensure real terms spending cuts for our schools' But admitting afterwards that the amount of cash per pupil – around £4,200 a year for primary pupils, and £5,300 for those at secondary school – would be frozen, he said: ‘I think that schools have demonstrated brilliantly over the last five years that they can be more efficient, they can be more effective, they can make their budgets work better.’ The Lib Dems today released the 'Gove Files' detailing what they claim were plans to cut money for schools when the coalition was formed. In a 13-page dossier attacking Michael Gove, Lib Dems set out a point by point assessment of the Conservative's time in government before he was appointed Chief Whip. Tensions between Mr Gove and his Lib Dem colleagues erupted publicly on a number of occasions during his four years at the Department for Education, with Prime Minister David Cameron once forced to intervene in an ugly spat over funding. The document says Lib Dems have spent much of the Parliament engaged in a 'battle' with Mr Gove to damp down his 'ideological' reforms. They claim the Conservatives have 'scorched earth plans' that could mean funding for nurseries, schools and colleges is cut by a quarter within five years. Education Minister David Laws insisted Lib Dems stopped the Tories from reducing the schools budget in 2010. He said: 'The Conservative assumption in 2010 was for a cash freeze in the schools budget - a whopping 10% cut in real terms over the course of the Parliament.' A source close to Mr Gove said: 'This document is as honest as Clegg's policy on tuition fees. There's nothing else to say about such a ludicrous document.' The Conservatives’ decision not to cut funding for schools in the next Parliament, just after they promised an extra £2billion a year for the NHS, will also raise concerns about which departments will face cuts, with fears that defence could be affected. Labour is expected to announce that it would increase schools funding in real terms if it wins office by cutting the deficit more slowly. However, it refused to spell out its plans yesterday. The party’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt said the Conservatives’ claims to protect the schools budget were ‘unravelling’, adding: ‘You can’t protect schools when you have plans to take spending as a share of GDP back to levels not seen since the 1930s.’ The Liberal Democrats say the Tory plan would mean funding for nurseries, sixth form colleges and the pupil premium – which funnels funds for disadvantaged children – may be slashed by £3billion by 2020. Lib Dem schools spokesman David Laws said yesterday: ‘This is an unbelievably weak commitment from David Cameron. ‘The Conservatives have failed even to protect the schools budget in real terms, and it is clear that they will have to make deep cuts to early years and 16 to 19 education. This makes a mockery of the Conservatives’ claims to want to raise standards. You simply can’t improve education while starving schools, nurseries and colleges of the resources they need.’ The funding row comes as the Conservatives announced tough new standards on literacy and numeracy in a drive to raise standards. Mr Cameron said the Government ‘won’t tolerate failure’ and would raise achievement in 3,500 schools rated ‘requires improvement’ by the watchdog Ofsted. He said every secondary school in this category would be expected to become an academy. Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, attacked the proposals as ‘ill informed’ and a decision to ‘declare war on schools’. David Cameron at a London school yesterday when he was asked to calculate nine eights . His party wants all children to know up to their 12 times table by the time they leave primary school. But David Cameron seemed wary of leading by example yesterday, when he was asked to calculate nine eights. The Prime Minister said: ‘I do times tables only in the car with my children on the way to school and I’m going to stick to that in case I get it wrong.’ He told a journalist, who asked him the question after his speech on schools in North London, that he was employing the ‘Nicky Morgan defence’ – a reference to the answer given by his education secretary when she was asked on television what seven times eight is. Mrs Morgan told the Good Morning Britain programme yesterday morning: ‘I’m not going to be answering any maths questions.’ The question is a classic minefield for politicians. Last summer, George Osborne refused to answer the ‘seven times eight’ question when interviewed by children on live television. He told seven-year-old Samuel Raddings from Manchester that he made it ‘a rule in life not to answer a load of maths questions’, but he added: ‘Of course there is a lot of maths in my job.’ In 1998, Labour schools minister Stephen Byers was asked to multiply eight by seven and said ‘54’. The answer is 56.","PM said the amount of money per child will be protected in cash terms .

"Margaret Johnson, 38, preyed on distracted parents and vulnerable pensioners to steal handbags and purses in a string of thefts last month . A prolific criminal known as the 'Pickpocket Queen of Birmingham' by police stuck her middle finger up at officers and shouted 'I'll be back' as she was jailed. Margaret Johnson, 38, preyed on distracted parents and vulnerable pensioners before stealing their handbags and purses in a string of thefts last month. She admitted five counts of theft at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Friday and was sentenced to 43 weeks - more than 10 months - in prison. Johnson, of no fixed address, struck twice on January 9 - just four days after she was released from prison - at a Poundland store in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands. She first pinched a purse from the pouch of a 90-year-old woman's walking frame before lifting a bag from a toddler's pushchair in another aisle of the shop. The next day she walked off with a handbag from a shopper trying on shoes in Clarks in Birmingham city centre before repeating the trick at another store on January 12. On January 23 she stole a handbag from high street outlet Deichman, but was spotted by undercover officers a few days later. Speaking after the hearing, investigating officer PC Matt Evans, of West Midlands Police, said: 'This was a systematic targeting of the vulnerable and distracted. 'Her victims included a 90-year-old woman, a mother with small children and foreign students - Johnson is the pickpocket Queen of Birmingham and a callous thief. 'She shows no remorse for targeting vulnerable people and that's why our team takes particular pleasure in putting her behind bars. 'Whilst being led from court she flicked a middle finger in my direction and shouted ""I'll be back"". 'Well we'll be waiting for her and if she doesn't work with our offender managers to try and break her crime habit she can expect to spend much of her life behind bars.' West Midland Police's pickpocket team, where undercover officers pose as shoppers on the look-out for thieves, is the only specialist theft unit in the UK outside London. . Johnson admitted five counts of theft at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Friday and was sentenced to 43 weeks - more than 10 months - in prison . PC Evans, added: 'It's been a great success and enabled us to link offences that would otherwise have been investigated in isolation and if any emerging trends or new tactics are identified all UK forces can be quickly brought up to speed. 'Most retailers have comprehensive CCTV coverage which means offenders are very likely to be caught on camera - and we know all our most prolific offenders on sight. 'It's a constant battle but one we're determined to win. 'Almost all our persistent offenders are currently behind bars and, when they are released, one of us will be waiting at the prison gates to say hello and give them a little reminder we're still here.' Officers also hope to have a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) in place before Johnson is released from prison to ban the shoplifter from her regular haunts.","Margaret Johnson preyed on distracted parents and vulnerable pensioners .

"Australian journalist Peter Greste has revealed it was traumatic leaving his colleagues behind in a Cairo prison and he didn't truly believe he was being freed until he was seated on a plane bound for Cyprus. Greste has used his first interview since being deported from Egypt to call on the country to release other detained journalists including Al Jazeera colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed. 'You spend 400 days in such close proximity with people and you really get to know them very, very well,' the 49-year-old told Al Jazeera in Cyprus on Monday. Scroll down for video . Australian journalist Peter Greste speaks during an interview a day after his release from prison in Egypt . Greste appears in a defendants' cage in a courthouse near Tora prison in Cairo, Egypt in May last year . 'So it was a very difficult moment walking out of that prison, saying goodbye to those guys, not knowing how much longer they will have to put up with this.' Greste said even when driving to the airport on Sunday he wondered if his ordeal was really coming to end given there'd been other moments when freedom appeared imminent but was 'snatched away'. 'So I really didn't want to let myself believe it really was happening until I got my backside on a seat on the plane with my brother Mike and we knew, then, that for me at least, this is over.' The Australian said the key to surviving jail had been to stay fit physically, mentally and spiritually. Greste exercised by running, kept mentally fit by studying and remained spiritually strong through meditation. Greste's family (left to right): mother Lois, brother Andrew and father Juris,  in Brisbane following his release . Greste's family gave a press conference after he was released following 400 days in an Egyptian prison . 'It was a way of enforcing a kind of discipline on myself and dealing with each day as it came,' he said. 'Hopefully ... I've come out of it not too damaged.' The award-winning correspondent described his release as a massive step forward. 'I just hope that Egypt keeps going down this path with the others,' he said. 'If it's appropriate for me to be free it's right for all of them to be freed.' Greste wasn't expecting to be released ahead of a scheduled retrial. However while running on Sunday the prison warden called him over and told him to pack his things. 'I said ""What do you mean?"" and he said ""You're going"" and I said ""Where, to another prison?"" and he said 'No the (Australian) embassy is coming they'll be here in an hour'.' Greste said Monday that his freedom was something of a 'rebirth"" and that key to his well-being while incarcerated for more than a year was exercising, studying and meditating . Greste poses for a photograph in Kibati village, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in August 2013 . Al-Jazeera English producer Baher Mohamed, left, Canadian-Egyptian acting Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy, center, and correspondent Greste, right, appear in court in March 2014 . Greste said he is now looking forward to ""watching a few sunsets and the stars"" and ""feeling the sand under my toes"". Fahmy's relatives expect the Canadian-Egyptian to also be deported under a decree passed by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi that allows for the transfer of foreigners on trial. Canada said Greste's release was positive and it remained 'very hopeful' Fahmy would be freed soon. Al Jazeera also vowed to pursue the campaign to free its other two journalists. But Heather Allan, head of newsgathering at the channel, admitted she wasn't confident Mohamed, an Egyptian, would be released. '(But) are we going to keep on fighting it? Absolutely,' she said. 'We are not going to leave him there.' Mohamed's family has pinned their hopes on a presidential pardon or his acquittal on appeal. The journalists were arrested in late 2013 for allegedly aiding the black-listed Muslim Brotherhood.","Peter Greste said it was hard to leaving his colleagues in a Cairo prison .

"Leeds General Infirmary has apologised to the family of 11-year-old Bradley Brough (pictured), from Upper Poppleton, near York, who died two days after undergoing heart surgery in October 2010 . A hospital has issued an apology to the family of an 11-year-old boy who died after an operation amid a debate over whether it should continue to provide heart surgery services for children. Leeds General Infirmary in West Yorkshire has apologised to the family of Bradley Brough, who died two days after undergoing heart surgery in October 2010. Yvette Oade, chief medical officer for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, today said the trust wished to apologise to his parents for the 'distress and anguish' caused by his tragic death and the 'errors that were made during his last surgical treatment'. Bradley, from Upper Poppleton, near York, was born with a number of health problems including a congenital heart condition which required several operations at the hospital. He was admitted for further surgery on October 11, 2010. His parents, Sharon and Kevin Brough, said it was only after the 10-hour operation was completed that they were told their son had been taken to the intensive care unit. They said his condition deteriorated rapidly and another operation could not determine the problem. Surgeons tried again the next day and Bradley's parents were told this surgery had been a success, but they said he deteriorated further with his pupils becoming dilated and non-reactive and his eyes beginning to bulge from his head. Scans and tests showed Bradley had a large cerebral haemorrhage and that a large section of his brain had become unresponsive. He died with his family at his bedside on October 13, 2010. Nihal Weerasena, the surgeon who carried out the operation on Bradley, has not carried out any surgery since March 2013 under a voluntary agreement. She remains under investigation by the General Medical Council (GMC). Apologising to Bradley's family, chief medical officer Dr Oade said today: 'On behalf of the trust I want to apologise to Mr and Mrs Brough for the distress and anguish caused by Bradley's tragic death and the errors that were made during his last surgical treatment. 'Lessons from Bradley's death have been learned by the clinical team and changes have been put in place as a result. 'I can confirm a settlement has now been reached with Bradley's family, and once again would like to stress our sincere condolences to them.' Sharon and Kevin Brough have now received a settlement from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and said they hope lessons have been learned at the hospital unit following the death of their son Bradley (pictured) Bradley died two days after undergoing heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary in West Yorkshire (pictured) Mr and Mrs Brough  said they now hope lessons have been learned at the hospital unit. Mother-of-three Mrs Brough, 44, said: 'Over four years later our family are still absolutely devastated over the loss of Bradley - he was a lively and loveable child who brought so much happiness to our lives. 'He wanted to be a writer when he grew up so that he could write books about his experiences to help other children with similar conditions to his. 'We do not think the standard of care Bradley received by medical staff at Leeds General Infirmary was acceptable and more should have been done so he could be with us today. 'We are pleased that the trust admitted responsibility for the mistakes made during Bradley's care at the hospital. 'We have now received a settlement which marks the end of the legal battle, but we just hope that lessons can be learned to make sure that each and every patient gets the care and support they need and that no other families are faced with the horrendous ordeal we are going through after losing our son.' The family's lawyer, Margaret Ryan, from Irwin Mitchell, added: 'We are pleased that following an admission from the trust we were able to secure a settlement and an apology for the family and in turn secure justice in Bradley's memory. 'His family would like assurances from the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust that lessons have been learned by medical staff and that other families will not have to go through the pain they have after losing their son.' Bradley was born with a number of health problems including a congenital heart condition which required several operations at the hospital. He was admitted for surgery on October 11, 2010 and died two days later . Bradley's mother Sharon, 44, said: 'Over four years later our family are still absolutely devastated over the loss of Bradley (pictured) - he was a lively and loveable child who brought so much happiness to our lives' His mother said he was a keen writer and wanted to write books about his experiences to help other children . The hospital unit has been under the spotlight ever since it was earmarked for closure, along with one in Leicester and the Royal Brompton in west London, as part of a nationwide plan to streamline children's cardiac surgery into fewer, more specialised units. However, after a fierce campaign and two legal challenges, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt halted the plan and ordered NHS England to re-evaluate the whole process. In 2013, shortly after the campaigners' key legal victory, operations at the unit were suspended for more than a week due to fears over mortality rates and other concerns brought to the attention of NHS England. The move provoked huge anger and debate, especially as parents and clinicians from the unit linked it to the continuing controversy about which children's heart surgery units were to be closed. A series of detailed reviews into the unit since that closure has found the centre to be safe, but controversy continues over the future of children's heart surgery at Leeds and the other centre in the north-east of England, in Newcastle. In relation to the broader issues surrounding the heart unit, chief medical officer Dr Oade said: 'In October 2014 the final report into the Leeds children's heart surgery unit was published. 'This provided a conclusion to the four independent reviews into the care, mortality rates, governance and family support at the unit, which have taken place over the previous 18 months. 'No other children's heart unit in the UK has been the subject of such intense review and scrutiny in recent times. Bradley's mother Sharon said today: 'We do not think the standard of care Bradley received by medical staff at Leeds General Infirmary was acceptable and more should have been done so he could be with us today' Yvette Oade, chief medical officer for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said the trust wished to apologise  for the 'distress and anguish' caused by his death and the 'errors that were made during his last treatment' 'It is important to stress the overall conclusions were that the service is safe and running well. 'As with any report of this nature, a number of recommendations were made about ways in which we could improve the service further and already significant progress has been made in implementing these across the unit. 'In addition the findings have helped in the development of NHS England's national standards for congenital heart disease, which are due for publication later this year. 'The trust has previously apologised to the small number of families where care and support were not to our usual high standards. 'We have made significant changes to our services to improve this experience and ensure we are as supportive as possible during such a difficult time.'","Bradley Brough died aged 11, just two days after undergoing heart surgery .

Knight's attorney has said the 49-year-old rap legend is an innocent victim who accidentally ran over the men as he tried to escape a vicious attack. James Blatt said Suge Knight, real name Marion Hugh Knight Jr, was called to Tam's Burgers in Compton  for a meeting and was attacked by four people as he slowed his truck. The men beat him through his window, tried to pull him outside, and threatened to kill him. After the attack Knight was so 'discombobulated' when escaping the scene that he was unaware that he hit anyone, according to TMZ. Blatt boasted last week that the rap mogul was innocent of homicide and that surveillance footage would prove it. But it has now been revealed that the CCTV camera trained at the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant where Knight allegedly ran over two men, killing one, last Thursday was not working the night in question. The owner of Tam's Burger in Compton, California confirmed the security camera was broken in an interview with TMZ. It actually appears that no security cameras in the area captured the bloody scene, though the parking lot is bordered by a Wells Fargo, Louisiana Fried Chicken and Rite Aid. 'Accident': Terry Carter, 55, left, died in the accident while Cle 'Bone' Sloan, right was injured . Out of order: The owner of Tam's Burgers in Compton, California says CCTV wasn't working the night Knight allegedly killed a man. Above, an LAPD photographer checks the scene of the incident . Law enforcement sources also told TMZ that they are hoping someone filmed the fight on their cell phone footage, though they previously said in statements that they already had video evidence of the killing. Sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida previously said that detectives were reviewing a video, but 'they have made no such arrangements with' Knight's attorney nor did they plan to show it to him. Meanwhile, Knight remained jailed on suspicion of murder after turning himself in early Friday. Sheriff's deputies said Knight hit and killed his friend Terry Carter, 55, with his pickup truck Thursday in the parking lot of a Compton fast-food restaurant, also injuring Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, an actor and film consultant who was hospitalized and in stable condition late Friday. The incident was the latest in a long line of brushes with death and the law for the 49-year-old founder of Death Row Records, one of the genre's leading labels. Knight started the label that helped solidify West Coast rap with Dr. Dre, who had been a member of the legendary group N.W.A. The label also launched the career of Snoop Dogg and had Tupac Shakur in the last months of his life. The fatal run-in occurred a short while after Knight was told by deputies providing security to leave a film location after arguing with Sloan, who was working on the set, during a break from filming a promotional video for the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" about the rise of N.W.A. The argument resumed and escalated a short while later at a fast-food restaurant a few miles away, with Knight and Sloan exchanging punches through his open window, sheriff's Lt. John Corina said. Knight is the founder of Death Row Records, which worked with Tupac Shakur (Knight and the rapper pictured above in August 19996 file photo) in the last months of his life . Corina said Knight backed up his pickup truck and knocked Sloan down. 'Then he puts the truck in drive, drives forward, running over him, and then keeps going forward and keeps on driving, and runs over Carter, who is standing in the parking lot, and keeps on going after that,' Corina said. He said witnesses told investigators it looked like an intentional act. Authorities said they do not believe Carter was involved in the altercation. The incident came less than six months after Knight was shot six times at a West Hollywood nightclub in August — the second shooting he's survived. No arrests have been made. At 6-foot-4 and weighing 325 pounds, Knight has a reputation as an imposing figure that is credited, in part, with helping create Death Row Records when he strong-armed another label to release Dr. Dre from his contract, said Chuck Creekmur, CEO of allhiphop.com. Knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting Tupac Shakur against Biggie Smalls in an East Coast-versus-West Coast rivalry. Knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with Shakur at a Las Vegas hotel, just hours before Shakur was fatally shot while riding in Knight's car just east of the Strip. Smalls, whose real name was Chris Wallace, was shot to death in a similar attack six months later. Knight and Dre later had a falling out, and Dre left. The record company eventually declared bankruptcy and was auctioned off. Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, another former N.W.A. member, were at the film location Thursday, but they didn't see Knight. In November, Knight pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed after a celebrity photographer accused him of stealing her camera in Beverly Hills. Because of prior convictions, he could face up to 30 years in prison.","Suge Knight charged with murder in hit-and-run that killed Terry Carter .

"Always' Super Bowl commercial was supposed to make young girls feel empowered by using the phrase 'like a girl' as a positive description, rather than an insult. But after it aired during Sunday night's game, sour Twitter users created the hashtag '#likeaboy' to demand they got some attention too. 'Can we get a #LikeABoy commercial too please?,' one Twitter user, Jack Doyle, wrote. The commercial contrasts responses from a group of young adults with responses from a group of young girls when they are asked to run, throw and fight 'like a girl'. Mocking: For its Super Bowl commercial, Always' asked a group of young people to run, fight or throw 'like a girl' and filmed their mocking responses . Fighters: But when they asked young girls the same thing, their responses were determined and powerful . The first group mock girls by running dramatically, flailing their arms and legs and weakly attempting to throw a  ball. By contrast, the young girls run, throw and fight with determination. When one is asked what it means to 'run like a girl', she responds: 'It means run fast as you can.' But male viewers weren't happy at being left out. 'Seriously #likeagirl is the most insulting commercial ever and there better be a #likeaboy commercial,' Jarred Moore wrote on Twitter. Thad Castle added: '#LikeABoy because I can actually run and throw.' 'Hopefully one day men can have equality and treated the same #LikeABoy,' Dalton Jones added. Left out: After it aired, viewers took to Twitter to claim boys should get the same treatment, above and below . As more self-proclaimed 'meninists' - men who believe they need their own movement to counter feminism - ranted about inequality, other viewers started to take note. 'Seconds after #LikeAGirl started trending, someone created #LikeABoy bc masculinity needs constant reassurance & attention,' wrote one user with the handle @WondersFantasy. Another user named Jae added: 'The difference between like a boy and like a girl is that ""#LikeABoy"" has never been used as a generalized insult against men.' Others used the men's new Twitter handle to deride them. One user, @Emily_Dynamite, wrote: 'When women get a commercial dedicated to feminism and empowerment, get annoyed and start making fun of it #LikeABoy.' Speaking out: But after their complaints, men and women started fighting back by using the new hashtag . Another, Mikayla, added: 'Throw a tantrum that there's ONE commercial about girls in 4 hour event centered around masculinity #LikeABoy' Despite the outcry, many Super Bowl viewers commended Always for the empowering advert. '#LikeAGirl is the best thing to happen. Ever,' wrote Lilly Singh. Whitney Burns added: 'To boys making fun of the #LikeAGirl commercial: I hope God blesses you with a baby girl and I wanna see you tell her what shes incapable of.'","Always' Super Bowl commercial shows a group of people being asked to run, fight or throw 'like a girl' and their mocking responses .

"A second military healthcare worker has been flown back to the UK after suffering a suspected needle injury while treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. Public Health England today confirmed the worker has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London for monitoring. A spokesman stressed that at this time 'they have not been diagnosed with Ebola and do not have symptoms'. It comes after another healthcare worker arrived back in the UK on Saturday for Ebola monitoring amid fears they were exposed to the virus when treating patients in Sierra Leone. Scroll down for video . Public Health England (PHE) said the individual has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London for assessment and next of kin have been informed . As with the latest case it is thought that worker was also exposed via a needle-injury. But officials were quick to stress the two incidents are not thought to be related. PHE said there is no risk to the general public. Professor Paul Cosford, PHE's director for health protection and medical director, today said: ''We can confirm that all the appropriate support is being offered to this individual and that strict protocols have been followed to transfer them back to the UK. 'We would like to emphasise that there is no risk to the general public's health. 'Our thoughts are with both of the healthcare workers, and their families, affected at this time.' Both healthcare workers will remain at the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead for the remainder of their 21-day incubation periods. The virus has an incubation period of between two days and three weeks. The Royal Free has the capacity to assess and monitor the latest returning healthcare worker alongside their colleague, admitted on Saturday. Being pricked by a needle is a cause for concern because the virus is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The individual is likely to have been exposed to the virus but has not been diagnosed with Ebola and does not have symptoms. Pictured is the High Secure Infectious Disease Unit at The Royal Free Hospital . The medics are being treated at London's Royal Free Hospital (RFH), where British nurses Pauline Cafferkey (left) and Will Pooley (right) were treated in a specialist isolation unit . There are currently no specific drugs to cure Ebola, nor any approved vaccines to prevent the disease. Two experimental vaccines are currently being trialled on human volunteers in the UK, US, Liberia, Mali and Uganda. The medics transferred to the Royal Free Hospital in London are currently being monitored and health officials have stressed they have not been diagnosed with the disease. In the event they do begin to show symptoms they will receive supportive care. The Royal Free Hospital is the only High Level Isolation Unit in the UK to house two high-security containment beds. They are located inside isolation 'bubbles' - specially-designed tents with controlled ventilation allowing medics to provide clinical care while containing the infection. Three other hospitals - The Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Royal Victoria Infirmary and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals - are designated centres for escalation if more patients are diagnosed with Ebola. There are around 50 other designated Ebola beds at these three centres. Initially medics work to re-hydrate patients using oral and intravenous fluids. Specific symptoms such as diarrohea and fever are treated directly, to try and improve her chances of surviving. William Pooley, the British nurse who survived Ebola, was treated with the experimental drug ZMapp. It is a blend of three laboratory-made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus. Two US aid workers, Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol were also given the drug after they were infected with the virus while working in Liberia. They too, subsequently recovered. But experts do not know if those given the drug were saved by it, or whether luck played a part. Around 45 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment. Meanwhile at least two other patients treated with ZMapp have died, possibly because help got to them too late. ZMapp, developed by US biotech company Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, is manufactured in the leaves of genetically modified tobacco plants. In September, shortly after being discharged from the Royal Free, Mr Pooley, travelled to the US to undergo a blood transfusion to help an American colleague who was being treated for the virus. It is thought the blood of those who have survived the disease may contain antibodies, which can prove effective in fighting the disease. Minister for the Armed Forces Mark Francois, said despite two similar incidents with a short space of time, 'both appear to be unrelated'. He said: 'Our personnel receive the highest standard of training and briefing prior to deployment, including on the use of the specialised Personal Protective Equipment. 'On a visit to the country before Christmas I witnessed first-hand the bravery and commitment of the personnel who are doing such a fantastic job in Sierra Leone. 'Their efforts are deserving of the highest praise and we wish all the best for their 2 colleagues who are now in the UK.' He stressed admitting the healthcare worker to the Royal Free is an 'entirely precautionary measure', adding the priority is the 'wellbeing of the individual involved'. Their family has been informed and 'will receive all possible support from the Government', Mr Francois added. On Saturday the first military healthcare worker, suspected of coming into contact with the virus via a needle injury, was admitted to the Royal Free. The injury is thought to have been inflicted while the individual was treating a patient near Sierra Leone's capital Freetown. It is thought the medic was working at the Kerry Town treatment centre, 40km from Freetown and that the injury happened within 48 hours of their being flown home. That is the window of opportunity to fly someone who has had known exposure to Ebola back to the UK, as they are not yet contagious. The virus has an incubation period of between two and 21 days. PHE said the individual arrived back in the UK on an RAF flight after being exposed to the virus in a 'frontline care setting'. It is believed the military transport, bringing the patient back as a precautionary measure, arrived at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire in the early hours of Saturday morning. The latest medic is likely to have been flown home in similar circumstances. The Kerry Town complex includes an 80-bed treatment centre managed by Save the Children and a 12-bed centre staffed by British Army medics specifically for health care workers and international staff responding to the Ebola crisis. The patients are being treated at London's Royal Free Hospital (RFH), where British nurses Pauline Cafferkey and Will Pooley were treated in a specialist isolation unit. They were each diagnosed with the disease after helping treat patients in Africa. The Royal Free, said in a statement: 'We can confirm that a second UK military healthcare worker has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital today following a needlestick injury while working in Sierra Leone. 'The individual has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital for assessment. 'The individual is likely to have been exposed to Ebola virus but has not been diagnosed with Ebola and does not have symptoms.' It is thought the first medic, who was flown home on Saturday, was working at the Kerry Town treatment centre (pictured), 40km from Freetown . There is one known case of a British person becoming infected with Ebola following a needle stick accident. Geoffrey Platt contracted the virus when he accidentally pricked his finger while taking a sample from an infected guinea pig at the Microbiological Research Establishment at Porton Down in Wiltshire. The former lab technician fell ill in November 1976, suffering vomiting, diarrhoea and a rash. He was kept in isolation for 40 days but made a full recovery. The World Health Organisation has said the epidemic has killed more than 8,800 people - the majority in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, since last year. But the crisis is showing signs of abating, the WHO said. Last week officials said there were fewer than 100 cases in a week for the first time since June. In the week from January 25 there were 30 cases in Guinea, four in Liberia and 65 in Sierra Leone. The WHO said the epidemic has entered a 'second phase' with the focus shifting to ending the outbreak. The first symptoms of Ebola include a fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, a sore throat and intense muscle weakness. Patients typically develop these symptoms after five to seven days, but can appear between two and 21 days of a person becoming infected. After these symptoms develop people experience diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash, and stomach pain before liver and kidney functions deteriorate. If untreated, Ebola then causes internal bleeding and patients can bleed from their ears, eyes, nose or mouth. The first trial of an Ebola vaccine to take place in the region worst hit by the epidemic is starting today in Liberia. In a densely-populated neighbourhood of the capital Monrovia yesterday musicians launched the clinical trial. Guests clapped, danced along and nodded as they sang lyrics which explained the purpose and intent of the Ebola vaccination trial. The singing was part of a campaign to overcome Liberians' reluctance to embrace the vaccines amid conspiracy theories. A health worker tests lab samples at Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, formerly an Ebola holding centre. The first vaccine trial to take place in the region worst affected during the epidemic has started in Liberia . The actual trial begins in the Liberian capital today on the first group of volunteers. The vaccination trial is a product of a partnership set up by the governments of Liberia and the United States. Appearing at the launch event yesterday, Liberian Vice President Joseph Nyumah Boakai said the vaccines are 'very important for Liberia and for the world'. The vaccines contain a trace of Ebola virus that helps trigger an immune response against the virus, according to a document from Prevail, the acronym for Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia, as the US-Liberia collaboration is called. Mr Boakai urged Liberians 'to take courage because it is going to work'. The UN health agency said last week that the three worst-affected countries - Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia - have reported fewer than 100 cases in the past week, for the first time since June. The World Health Organisation said the outbreak has killed more than 8,000 people since it was identified in March last year.","Second healthcare worker flown back to the UK amid fears they have been exposed to Ebola while treating patients in Sierra Leone .

"Barack Obama yesterday outlined plans to close a loophole that lets companies such as Apple and Microsoft avoid paying taxes on overseas profits. The US President used the Budget for 2016 to impose a one-off 14 per cent tax on profits stashed abroad by American corporate giants, . The huge sums expected to be raised - nearly £160 billion - will pay for improvements to roads and bridges in the US, before the rate is increased to 19 per cent in future. U.S. president Barack Obama speaks at the Department of Homeland Security earlier today to deliver the administration's fiscal year budget for 2016 . The move comes amid an international backlash against firms such as Google and Starbucks that have been accused of avoiding tax on the profits earned in countries around the world, including the UK. But the tax raid proposed by the Democrat president needs to be approved by Republican-controlled Congress – setting the scene for months of wrangling. Prominent Republicans have already the criticised the ‘tax and spend’ budget although it has been previously thought that American companies have around £1.4trillion of profits stashed overseas. Firms do not currently have to pay US tax on foreign profits unless the money is brought back into America. Critics claim that the huge piles of cash stored overseas is down to aggressive tax planning policies by US companies, but businesses argue that the country’s tax rates are uncompetitive. The top rate of corporation tax in the US is 35 per cent compared with 21 per cent in Britain. George Osborne has said UK corporation tax will fall to 20 per cent in April – but Labour has pledged to reverse this tax cut if it wins power in the general election in May. In the last Autumn Statement George Osborne, pictured, also unveiled the so-called ‘Google tax’, which aims to target the profits earned by multinationals in the UK but diverted elsewhere . In the last Autumn Statement Mr Osborne also unveiled the so-called ‘Google tax’, which aims to target the profits earned by multinationals in the UK but diverted elsewhere. President Obama plans to go much further, however, raising far higher sums of money by targeting the profits both diverted and earned overseas. He wants to levy a 14 per cent one-off ‘transition’ tax on US profits held overseas as well as a 19 per cent levy on future profits as they are earned. The White House expects the one-off levy to raise £158 billion which will be used to fund infrastructure projects in the US including new roads and bridges. The proposals effectively amount to a huge tax raid on technology and drug companies that stash profits overseas in low tax countries such as Ireland and Bermuda. ‘This transition tax would mean that companies have to pay US tax right now rather than being able to delay paying any US tax indefinitely,’ a White House official said. A report by research firm Audit Analytics last year showed that General Electric had the most profits stored overseas at £73billion. Tech giants Microsoft and Apple and drugs companies Pfizer and Merck made up the rest of the top five. The proposals were part of a Budget that was aimed at boosting America’s Middle Class through higher taxes on corporations and the rich. Mr Obama said: ‘This country’s better off than it was four years ago, but what we also know is that wages and incomes for middle class families are just now ticking up. They haven’t been keeping pace over the last 30 years compared to corporate profits and what’s happening to folks in the very top.’ The Budget, for the fiscal year starting on October 1, forecast the deficit falling from 3.2 per cent of national income this year to 2.5 per cent or £315billion next year. The deficit would stabilise at that rate over the next 10 years, not rising above 2.6 per cent of national income under the plans. The Treasury estimates that George Osborne’s Google tax will raise just £25 million in the next financial year, rising to £270 million the following year. This figure will rise to £355 million by 2019/20 - still a drop in the ocean next to Obama’s tax.","Obama outlined plans to impose 14% tax on companies' overseas profits .

"A 'detoother' isn't a doctor but a gold-digger and a 'side-dish' certainly isn't something served by a waiter - it's a mistress. These, along with phrases such as 'spewing out buffalos' - which means that you can't speak proper English - are just a few examples of Uganda's unusual, locally-adapted language called 'Uglish.' And for the first time, the unusual Ugandan version of adapted English is set to be published in dictionary form. Uglish, a popular, locally-adapted English language will be published in dictionary form for the first time . 'It is so entrenched right now that, even when you think you cannot use it, you actually find yourself speaking Uglish,' Bernard Sabiiti, the author of the first Uglish dictionary, told AFP. 'Even as I was researching, I was surprised that these words are not English because they were the only ones I knew. 'A word like a 'campuser' - a university student - I used to think was an English word.' Uglish: A Dictionary of Ugandan English, which went on sale in bookshops across the east African country late last year, contains hundreds of popular Uglish terms, some coined by Ugandans as far back as the colonial period. Author of the first Uglish dictionary, Bernard Sabiiti, used to this 'campuser' - a university student - was actually a real English word . Sabiiti, 32, said the informal phrases were greatly influenced by the local Luganda language, and is a 'symptom of a serious problem with our education system' that he claims has been deteriorating since the 1990s. Uglish is largely dependent on sentences being literally translated from local dialects with little regard for context, while vocabulary used is derived from standard English. Meantime, Sabiiti says, influence from the Internet, local media and musicians have seen additional words and phrases created and slowly enter the lexicon. The result is colourful but at times confusing expressions. The language is pervasive in all parts of the country, resulting in colourful, confusing expressions . If you haven't seen someone for a while, for example, you're 'lost', while if you 'design well', you are snappy dresser. Today, Uglish is used by people from all walks of life, but particularly popular with youths. However, English is still the country's working language, and it remains the only medium of instruction in schools and in official business. But Sabiiti said everyone from the president to simple farmers speak at least some Uglish, which varies according to region, tribe and gender, and is regularly seen on signposts. 'MPs are almost notorious at using Uglish, you see it in parliamentary debates,' said Sabiiti. It's so prevalent, in fact, that it's even used in Parliament! MPs are notorious for using Uglish in debates . But it wasn't until 2011, a year after the term Uglish - pronounced 'You-glish' - had been coined on social media, that Sabiiti began keeping newspaper cuttings, conducting interviews and searching online for material for his book. 'I knew that people talked a lot about this, and my friends used to laugh about it,' said the author, who also works for a think tank, which often takes him to the far reaches of the country. His book contains a brief history of Uglish, and a glossary of terms relating to education, telecommunications, society and lifestyle, food, transport, sex and relationships. One phrase commonly used when discussing the latter is 'live sex,' which means unprotected sex - a term thought to have derived from the live European football games Ugandans love to watch. 'When the ministry of health is doing campaigns to warn young people against unprotected sex, they use 'live sex', because everybody will understand it,' said Sabiiti. On the same subject, if you're a 'side-dish', you are someone's mistress. Following the dictionary's release, so many more phrases have been suggested that Sabiiti has decided to do a second edition . Sabiiti's book has proven popular among the middle class, including academics, and with locals and foreigners alike. To date he's sold about a thousand copies. 'I've had incredible feedback from professional linguists, ordinary readers - some even suggesting more phrases - so I'll be doing another edition,' said Sabiiti. 'I don't see it disappearing. I'm looking forward to seeing five years from now how many new words and phrases have joined the lexicon,' he said, adding some teachers, particularly in state schools, are passing Uglish on to their students. Though English is the country's language of instruction, Uglish is extremely popular with young people . But, as the author stresses in the final chapter of his book, there comes a point when Uglish stops being funny. In 1997 Uganda introduced universal primary school education, which eliminated official school fees and made education accessible to millions more children. But literacy rates remain low: more than a quarter of the population cannot read or write, according to the UN, and critics say standards remain low in many schools. 'Uglish is not something that should be encouraged, particularly for young, impressionable children,' he concluded. 'They really should learn what they call proper standard English.'","Uglish is Uganda's strange, locally-adapted English language .

"Three dogs have died within two months after drinking water at a popular recreational lake in California filled with toxic algae that flourished during the state's drought. Bigger signs will now be installed at Lake Chabot in Castro Valley to warn dog owners, said a spokesman for East Bay Regional Park District. Pet owners complained that the warning signs were inadequate following the death of the third animal, a five-year-old chocolate Labrador last Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Pet owners complained that the warning signs about the toxic algae were inadequate when a five-year-old chocolate Labrador named Josie died on Wednesday after drinking water from Lake Chabot . Carolyn Jones, a spokeswoman for the park district told San Jose Mercury News that the animal deaths are 'tragic' and that they're putting up more signs to keep dogs away from the water . The drought that has been affecting California caused algae to flourish at Lake Chabot in September, when rain and water runoff was not present to flush away impurities in the lake water . Two dogs died in December from the algae's toxins, which attack the animal's nervous system and liver, according to the San Jose Mercury News. The slimy blue-green algae has grown on the lake due to the lack of rain and runoff in the area. The Labrador, named Josie, was 'healthy as can be' when her owners took her for a walk on Wednesday, according to KTVU. But the algae poisoned Josie and she suffered liver failure after she drank from the lake's edge. The first dog to die was a white shepherd named Kuch, who collapsed hours after playing in the lake. The second was an eight-year-old cattle dog. The park has had a long-time ban on people and pets swimming in the lake because it's an emergency backup water source used for drinking in the East Bay Municipal Utility District. The lake can still be used, however, for boating and fishing. The East Bay Regional Park District is installing bigger signs at Lake Chabot Regional Park in Castro Valley to warns dog owners after a third dog in two months died from being exposed to the lake water .

Carolyn Jones, a spokeswoman for the park district told San Jose Mercury News that the animal deaths are 'tragic' and that they're putting up more signs to keep dogs away from the water. Park officials said the lake was not chemically treated because swimming is banned there and it would be difficult to treat the 315-acre lake due to its size. Signs were posted at the park's entrance and employees warned drivers about the algae threat, though no news release was issued. The park district advised anglers and boaters who touch the lake water to wash off with freshwater and to clean guts out of fish before cooking. Lake Chabot has remained open despite the algae outbreak. Signs were posted at the park's entrance and employees warned drivers about the algae threat, though no news release was issued .","A chocolate Labrador died on Wednesday at Lake Chabot in Castro Valley .

"A young boy with psychiatric problems is locked in a cage every day to stop him destroying things and beating up his sister while his father goes out to work. Xiao Wang, 12 years old, was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Cortical Dysplasia - a congenital abnormality which causes seizures. His single father, Zhong Kefu, 45, began locking him up after becoming worried by his violent behaviour,following complaints from neighbours. Xiao Wang, 12,  is locked in a 2 square metre (21 square feet) cage every day to protect his neighbours and sister from his violent outbursts . His father,  Zhong Kefu, 45 (centre) says he has to keep his son in the cage so he can go out to work to pay for food, and for medical treatment. Xiao has destroyed neighbours' property before, including smashing up an old lady's cooking pot, and is violent towards his six-year-old sister (left) In the past his son has taken neighbours' cloths, shoes and cell phones and thrown them in the village paddy fields, and smashed an old lady's cooking pot, That's magazine reports. For months now, Xiao has been made to sit in the metal cage measuring 2 square meters (21 square feet) with nothing but a wooden stool, a urinal and some sponges inside. Mr Zhong says he must keep his son in a cage so he can go out to work and earn enough money to pay for his treatment. Mr Zhong said: 'When he was younger he ate anything he picked up, whether it was edible or not. 'Then he started destroying things, smashing them to pieces. 'Neighbours started getting angry because he was destroying their property and being violent with other children. 'He was also breaking things at home.' Mr Zhong' s wife, who was mentally disabled, gave birth to Xiao  in 2002. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. It can occur in people of any intellectual ability but many people with ADHD also have learning difficulties. Symptoms of ADHD tend to be first noticed at an early age, and may become more noticeable as a child grows up. Many children with ADHD also must have conduct disorder –  involving a tendency towards highly antisocial behaviour, such as stealing, fighting, vandalism and harming people or animals. In half of children, there is also a tendency towards oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) – which is defined by negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards authority figures, such as parents and teachers. Studies have shown children with ADHD have 25 times the risk of being institutionalised for delinquency and nine times the risk of being sent to prison. His parents noticed he behaved different from other children of the same age, and his only words were 'dad' or 'baba', and as he grew his behaviour became increasingly challenging. He became violent with other children, including his sister, who is now six years old. Mr Zhong and his wife were only allowed to have a second child – something normally forbidden under the Chinese government's one-child policy – because of Xiao's condition. At first, Mr Zhong tied his son up and left him while he went to work in the village of Taoshu in Xiushui county in southern China's Jiangxi province. But when he got home he always found Xiao's wrists were red raw from struggling to get free. He tried locking him in his bedroom, but Xiao smashed the window one night and escaped, causing damage in the local neighborhood. Mr Zhong said: 'I would like him to be able to go to school, to get an education and play with other children. 'But no school will accept him. He has a six-year-old sister, but is always violent with her as well. 'I need to make money to support my family and to get him treatment. 'But the only thing I can do at the moment is keep him in the cage until I have raised enough.' For months now Xiao has been made to sit in the metal cage measuring 2 square meters (21 square feet) with nothing but a wooden stool, a urinal and some sponges inside. Mr Zhong is far from proud of his solution, according to That's magazine. 'I can't bear to treat him this way but the schools won't take him, and if I don't go out and work we'll starve,' it reported. A spokesman from the Jiangxi Children's Hospital where Xiao was diagnosed said: 'Unless he gets proper therapy soon he will stay this way for life.'

"Neanderthals probably cooked their food before eating but would have struggled to eat root vegetables, according to a new study. Geneticists have analysed ancient DNA from the remains of Neanderthals and another ancient human relative, the Denisovans. They found that these prehistoric human ancestors lacked key genes needed to chew hard foods - just like modern humans alive today. Neanderthals, depicted above by actor Ron Perlman in the film Quest for Fire, lacked genes that are thought to be essential for chewing tough raw food and so may have softened their food by cooking it over a fire . Chimpanzees, our closest living primate relative, still have these mastication genes as they need to chew tough, raw food. The scientists also found that Neanderthals and their Denisovan cousins may have struggled to digest starchy foods like root vegetables. Neanderthals may have cooked stews in the skins of animals, according to some anthropologists. Animal bones found at sites known to have been inhabited by Neanderthals are 90 per cent free of gnaw marks. This suggests that fat and meat had instead been cooked off the bones. A study of tooth plaque from the teeth of fossilised Neanderthal remains also suggest that they may have heated grains of barley. However, there is no evidence that Neanderthals had any pots or pans to cook with. Instead Professor John Speth, an archaeologist at the University of Michigan, believes that they used animal paunches and folded bark to make bags that they could boil their good in. A study of plaque found on Neanderthal teeth like the one above suggests they ate grains like barley . This is because, like chimpanzees, they had few copies of genes that release enzymes into the saliva and start digesting the starch as it is being chewed. Modern humans have around six copies of these saliva digesting genes while Neanderthals had just two. Neanderthals may also have tasted food in a different way from the way we do today and perhaps enjoyed plants that we find unpalatable. The researchers discovered that they had a completely unique variation in genes responsible for tasting particularly bitter compounds. They also lack two other taste receptors found in chimpanzees for tasting bitter foods. The findings raise tantalising questions about whether differences in the diet of Neanderthals compared to modern humans lead to them dying out. Their lack of digestive enzymes in their saliva could have meant they struggled to extract as much energy from starchy tubers compared to their Homo sapien counterparts. Changes in the vegetation around them could have also meant some of their preferred foods disappeared. While Neanderthals, who lived between 280,000 to 40,000 years ago, are known to have mastered control of fire, little is known about the food they ate. Analysis of their fossilised teeth has provided some clues that they may have used the fire to cook their food. Now the new study has provided further evidence that they did. Cooking is seen as being a key innovation that guided the course of human evolution as it makes important nutrients and higher levels of fats more readily available to the body during digestion. Professor George Perry, an anthropologist at the Pennsylvania State University, who led the research, said: 'A number of major dietary transitions have occurred during the six million years of hominin evolution, including substantial increases in the consumption of meat and starch, the cooking of food, and the domestication of plants and animals. 'We hypothesize that the functional loss of a gene that otherwise encodes an important masticatory muscle protein may very well have followed hominin control of fire and the advent of consistent cooking behavior, which results in substantial food softening and reduces demand on the masticatory apparatus.' Professor Perry, along with colleagues at Cornell University and the University of Texas, analysed the published genome sequences obtained from the fossilised remains of Neanderthals and Denisovans. The Denisovans are thought to have been a sister group to Neanderthals, splitting from a common ancestor around 600,000 years ago. They are thought to have lived further east than the Neanderthals that spread through Europe and the two species are thought to have eventually died out around at around the same time. Little is known about the diet and habits of Neanderthals, shown above in a museum model in Duesseldorf . Root vegetables like parsnips and turnips, above, contain a lot of starch that is a valuable source of energy but Neanderthals appear to have lacked important enzymes in their saliva needed to help digest these tubers . The study found that like their modern human cousins, both these extinct hominins lacked the MYH16 protein, which found in the large muscle fibres in primates with powerful jaws. Unlike modern man, however, they lacked the genes needed for digesting the lactose in cows' milk. This is thought to have evolved with the advent of agriculture some time later. The two ancient hominins also lacked genes used for tasting bitter food in chimpanzees - TAS2R62 and TAS2R64. However, the Neanderthals had a unique version of another bitter taste gene called TAS2R38. This gene is known to be essential for tasting the bitter flavour of a chemical called phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and other related chemicals. The fruit of the Chinese-laurel tree, Antidesma bunius, is known to contain chemicals similar to PTC that can only be tasted by people with this gene. Around 70 per cent of people can taste PTC, but this varies according to population - 42 per cent of Australian Aborigines and Papuans from New Guinea cannot taste it. The scientists analysed the genome sequences obtained by extracing scraps of DNA from the fossilised remains of Neanderthals, like this skull from an adult female , on display in the Natural History Museum . The new findings, which are published in the Journal of Human Evolution, suggest that while Neanderthals may have been able to taste this bitter flavour, it may have allowed them to only taste a specific sub-group of these chemicals. This would mean they perhaps would have avoided certain types of foods due to their bitter taste. The Neanderthals and Denisovans also had just two copies of an amylase gene, used to digest starch from root vegetables in the salavia, far fewer than in modern humans. Some experts have suggested that Neanderthals ate large qualities of root vegetables as a rich source of energy in their hunter-gatherer lifestyle. However, Professor Perry said: 'We can only conclude that if early hominins were consuming large quantities of starchy foods, as hypothesized, then they were likely doing so without the digestive benefits of increased salivary amylase production.' Speaking to the Mail Online, he added: 'I think that the effect on fitness from only having two functional copies of salivary amylase, relative to individuals who had more, was likely relatively small if it had an effect at all. 'Not that I don't think it mattered at all. There were likely a number of other factors that were more important in human and Neanderthal reproductive success and population history.' Professor Perry and his colleagues hope that as more Neanderthal genomes are obtained, it should the influence that their genes had on their diet should become clearer. They said it may eventually be possible to unravel exactly what foods would have tasted like to Neanderthals by examining the receptors involved in smell. They said: 'The timing of olfactory receptor gene gains and losses and functional changes could provide insights into hominin dietary evolution and evolutionary ecology. 'This analysis is currently challenged by our limited understanding of the specific functional consequences of olfactory receptor variation and by the short sequence reads typically obtained from ancient DNA, which often cannot be mapped uniquely to specific, highly similar olfactory receptor genes. We are hopeful for progress on all of these fronts.' Professor Chris Stringer, an expert on human evolution at the Natural History Museum in London, said that Neanderthals may have lost genes related to powerful jaws because they ate softer foods. He said: 'One thing that is often left out of the cooking/digestion debate is the fact that eating bone marrow and brains generally requires much less mastication than muscle fibres. 'We know from prehistoric butchery that early humans were certainly accessing those highly nutritious resources from carcasses and probably eating them raw, even where they had the use of fire. 'Laura Buck and I have been researching what we have called ‘gastrophagy’, the consumption of animal stomachs and their contents. 'We have found that this neglected aspect is and was actually quite a common behaviour in recent hunter-gatherers, and it seems very likely to have been prevalent in people like the Neanderthals. 'Thus they would have been able to access nutritious part-digested plant remains from chyme, saving a lot of gathering time and benefiting from the foraging and digestive systems of their prey.' Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, warned that while the genome could provide some picture of what Neanderthals and other ancient human ancestors were like, it might also be misleading. He said: 'We share something like 40% of our DNA with bananas so it’s not surprising that we share almost all of our genes with the neanderthals. 'As is so often the case in human evolution the devil is in the detail. While we have an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the neanderthal and Denisvoan genomes we don’t have anywhere near a complete picture. 'To rule out the presence of certain genes based on this form of comparison is potentially problematic - we can’t tell if the Neanderthal or Denisovans had been subject to genetic bottlenecks or perhaps came from small populations where the effect of genetic drift could have warped the picture. 'The mining of ancient genomes will in the future tell us much about our extinct ancestors but we need to keep in mind that the genes are only part of the story - we need to factor in the environment to properly understand the past.'","Geneticists at Pennsylvania State University analysed DNA from ancient human relatives to look for genes that are involved in eating and taste .

"Ed Balls claimed the current system of university financing would leave a 'huge looming charge' for taxpayers . Labour's plan to cut tuition fees to £6,000 a year will inflict 'colossal damage' on universities, top academics have warned today. University leaders said the move could leave them £10billion out of pocket and said it was 'implausible' that the government could step in to make up the difference given the state of the public finances. But Labour hit back this morning, claiming the current system was unfordable for students and taxpayers. Ed Balls said new figures showed half the student debts would never be repaid – leaving the government with a £2.5billion bill. But in a letter to the Times, a group of university vice chancellors accused Labour of failing to understand that cutting fees will only benefit richer graduates – because under the present system, people only start paying back their loans once they earn more than £21,000 a year. Student debts are also written off after 30 years. The vice-chancellors said Mr Miliband's plans to lower tuition fees by £3,000 would leave £2billion a year out of pocket. They fear future Labour governments would be unable to find an extra £2 billion a year in the present financial climate. Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey, said: 'This is purely a pragmatic issue, that a policy is evolving on the hoof which is not really a practical policy going forward and the potential damage is colossal: . 'I really feel Labour has missed the point here. If you talk to students and to many mums and dads, the £9,000 [fee] is no longer the key topic.' Simon Gaskell, president of Queen Mary University London, added: 'What our students tell us is that clearly the debts incurred through fees is important, but what would be a real game-changer for students, or what can defeat students, is the debt that arises from living expenses while they are at university. 'If money were to be spent to support the most needy students to go to university, subsidising fees is not the way to do it.' Cost cutting: Labour is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000 . But Mr Balls claimed the current system of university financing would leave a 'huge looming charge' for taxpayers as many graduates fail to pay back the cost of their tuition. 'The universities are hugely important but the status quo is not working well at the moment for the students, for taxpayers and the Government for a clear reason… we were told that the increase in fees to £9,000 would save money for taxpayers, save billions and deliver a good deal. 'What we've seen is graduate contributions go up by over 50%, graduates paying for their fees, we've seen money for universities go up by 28%, but it turns out its costing taxpayers more not less, and the truth is we're now in a position where almost half of students aren't repaying fees because they don't earn enough in their lifetime...there is a huge looming charge for taxpayers in the future. 'What I want is a solution which is fair for students, which doesn't stop students going to universities which protects the taxpayers and is also good for universities…the status quo is unsustainable, costly and hidden, George Osborne has played totally fast and loose with the public finances and we're going to expose that.' The row comes after House of Commons figures revealed that the Government's decision to triple tuition fees will end up costing students and taxpayers more money – because half the loans will never be repaid. Business Secretary Vince Cable said the Lib Dems had lost a lot of support after agreeing to increase tuition fees - but insisted it was 'worth it' Ministers increased the cap on student fees from £3,000 to £9,000 a year to fill the hole in university funding left by government cuts to the higher education budget. But, because student debs are written off after 30 years, 49.5 per cent will never be recouped, meaning the scheme will cost the government £2.5billion a year more than ministers claimed, House of Commons library figures show. At the same time average graduate debts have doubled from £20,000 in 2010 to £43,500. It comes after Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, revealed Labour would introduce a 'graduate tax' on the earnings of those who go to university to replace tuition fees. Mr Umunna said the system would be 'fairer' than tuition fees and would be introduced 'in the medium term' if Labour returns to power. The National Union of Students proposed an extra tax of between 0.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent of their income above £15,000, for a period of 20 years, with the highest earners paying higher rates. Labour is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000. Chuka Umunna revealed Labour would introduce a 'graduate tax' on the earnings of those who go to university to replace tuition fees . In 2011, it announced the policy as it sought to win over disaffected former Liberal Democrat voters angered by Nick Clegg reneging on a pledge to scrap fees and signing up to Coalition plans to allow institutions to charge up to £9,000 a year – triple the amount students paid previously. The £6,000 cap is expected to be included in Labour's general election manifesto, but it is not clear how the party intends to meet such an expensive commitment. Previously, Labour has suggested that it might pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks or with higher rates of interest for better-off students. The party may also be forced to restrict the cut in fees to certain types of courses such as technical degrees, leaving other students to keep on paying the current cost. Mr Umunna, who is responsible for higher education policy, said introducing a full-scale graduate tax 'as soon as possible is my priority'. Ed Miliband's campaign chief Lucy Powell attacked the decision to increase tuition fees. She said: 'Ed has long said that he thinks that the current system [of tuition fees] needs to change and a report out this morning, figures we've gained from the House of Commons library this morning show that the new funding arrangement, the increased tuition fees to £9,000 a year is actually costing the taxpayer more because half of those loans that people are having to take out won't be repaid. 'So we've got young people leaving university with £30,000, £40,000 worth of debt. Nearly half of them won't actually repay those loans so it's costing the taxpayer more anyway.' The decision to hike tuition fees is one of the most controversial decisions of the Coalition. Nick Clegg, appearing on the comedy show The Last Leg on Friday admitted it had given him sleepless nights. However he also continued to defend the decision, adding: 'I'm not Prime Minister so I can't do what I want.' The Lib Dems have pointed to figures showing the gap between the number of rich and poor students wanting to go on to higher education had fallen since 2010. Business Secretary Vince Cable has described the new system as 'better, affordable and fair'. He said: 'We have paid a price for this policy more than any other party. But the success of these reforms, with more students from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to university than ever before, shows it was a price worth paying. 'Regardless of family circumstances, all students can now obtain university level education as long as they meet academic requirements. This is a good legacy.' The figures, from university admissions service Ucas, show 21 per cent of 18-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds in England applied this year. Overall, the richest 18-year-olds in the UK are 2.4 times more likely to want to go to university than the poorest. But in 2006, when Labour was in power, the wealthiest were 3.7 times more likely to want to apply.","Ed Miliband has previously pledged to cut fees by £3,000  after the election .

"Timothy Zeman (above), 51, from Pacific, Missouri allegedly stole a tow truck to steal back his two vehicles from an impound lot . A man is accused of stealing a tow truck to steal back his two vehicles from an impound lot before leading police on a chase. Timothy Zeman, 51, from Pacific, Missouri was accused of stealing a flatbed truck yesterday from Hyndrich Brothers Towing and then used it to retrieve his previously impounded cars from a different lot in Jefferson County. He was chased by both sheriff's deputies and Missouri Highway Patrol before being arrested after driving into a bluff, said police. Zeman has been charged with first-degree tampering and felony resisting arrest, and is being held in the Franklin County jail on a $50,000 bond, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Deputies were able to determine the two cars being towed on the stolen wrecker belonged to Zeman - and believe he took them from the impound lot with the truck. Zeman is said to have broken into the tow yard overnight. He was seen by a deputy on Sunday who was traveling on Highway O, and spotted a tow truck matching the description of the missing wrecker reported in a call to the sheriff's office at 7am. Scroll down for video . Zeman was accused of stealing a flatbed truck yesterday and then used it to retrieve his previously impounded cars from a different lot located in Jefferson County. He was caught after driving into a bluff (above) The wrecker arrived at a driveway on Highway O near the entrance of Red Barn Mobile Home Park. As the deputy pulled behind the tow truck, Zeman reversed towards the police car before setting off and a slow-speed pursuit ensued. While the deputy gave chase, he threw items out of the window, according to the sheriff's office. The deputy was joined in the chase by Missouri Highway Patrol and a second deputy involved attempted to stop the fleeing vehicle by placing spikes in front of the wrecker's tires on St Louis Rock Road, according to KMOV. He allegedly took the wrecker from Hyndrich Brothers Towing and then led police on a chase (a truck from the towing company pictured above) However the attempt was unsuccessful as Zeman continued with deflated front tires as he headed onto Highway 100 toward Washington. Police in Washington were informed to stop traffic traveling east and deputies drove westbound in front of the truck to warn oncoming traffic. Zeman fled to Elizabeth Ann Drive before he crashed into a bluff. He refused to come out of the vehicle and had to be forcibly taken out, and was placed in custody. He has been investigated for auto theft, felony resisting arrest and several traffic charges that are impending.

"The temperature of Earth's surface has increased by only 0.06°C in the past 15 years - a fact that contradicts global warming climate models. This so-called 'pause' has been used by some groups as evidence that climate change is not taking place. Now a new study suggests that the discrepancy between the models and reality is all down to random fluctuations in the Earth's climate – and that the long-term trend still points to severe warming. The solid black line is the global mean surface temperature. The dashed black line is the average for this data on surface temperatures. The blue and red lines are linear trends for each 15-year period from 1840. The researchers claim to have shown that these 15-year trends are dominated by natural variations in the climate . Researchers at Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg and Leeds University in the UK say the models do not overestimate man-made climate change. They claim global warming is 'highly likely' to reach critical proportions by the end of the century - if the global community does not finally get to grips with the problem. 'The claim that climate models systematically overestimate global warming caused by rising greenhouse gas concentrations is wrong,' says Jochem Marotzke from the Max Planck Institute. The apparent mismatch between observed temperature increases and predictions from climate change models has led to some to claim that global warming has stalled, as seen by the black line in the graph above . The global average temperature has risen only slightly since 1998 – which is surprising, considering scientific climate models predicted considerable warming due to rising greenhouse gas emissions. Some people used this apparent contradiction to question climate change per se – or at least the harm potential caused by greenhouse gases – as well as the validity of the climate models. Meanwhile, the majority of climate researchers continued to emphasise that the short-term ‘warming hiatus’ could largely be explained on the basis of current scientific understanding and did not contradict longer term warming. Recently, researchers have been looking into the possible causes of the warming hiatus over the past few years. In a separate study, ETH Zurich recently concluded that two important factors are equally responsible for the hiatus. One of the important reasons is natural climate fluctuations, of which the weather phenomena El Niño and La Niña in the Pacific are the most important, they claim. According to the study, the second important reason for the warming hiatus is that radiation from the sun has been weaker than predicted in the past few years. 'Climate sceptics often make precisely this claim, citing the warming pause as evidence. 'Yet they cannot deny that nine of the ten warmest years since systematic climate observations began have occurred in the new millennium and that global warming has slowed at a very high level. 'The sceptics also ignore the fact that ocean temperatures continue to rise as rapidly as many models have predicted. 'On the whole, the simulated trends agreed well with the observations' To explain the discrepancy between model simulations and observations, Professor Marotzke and Piers Forster compared simulated and observed temperature trends over all 15-year periods since the start of the 20th century. For each year between 1900 and 2012 they looked at the temperature trend that each of the 114 available models predicted for the subsequent 15 years. They then compared the results with measurements of how the temperature actually rose or fell. By simulating the average global temperature and other climatic variables of the past and comparing the results with observations, they were able to check the reliability of their models. The 114 model calculations withstood the comparison. 'On the whole, the simulated trends agree with the observations,' said Professor Marotzke. 'The most pessimistic and most optimistic predictions of warming in the 15 subsequent years for each given year usually differed by around 0.3 degrees Celsius. Climate models, such as the one above, predict a significant increase in temperature by the end of this century, especially at the Earth's poles. No model, however, has predicted the global warming hiatus which climate researchers have observed since the turn of the millennium . Some scientists claim one of the causes of the ‘plateau’ in sea-surface temperature is a change in the exchange of ocean water. They believe this exchange is occurring between warm, surface waters and cold, deep waters below 2,300ft (700 metres) – as if the warming is ‘hiding’ underwater. Easterly trade winds of the Pacific Ocean have increased significantly over the past two decades and as a result are blowing higher volumes of warm surface sea water to deeper depths. Stronger trade winds blowing from South America to Australia have had the net effect of cooling surface temperatures by a global average of between 0.1°C and 0.2°C, . This would be enough to account for the apparent hiatus in global average temperatures over the past 15 years. The warm water won’t hide below the surface forever: scientists believe that it may re-emerge later or affect other climate indicators, such as sea level or ocean circulation. 'However, the majority of the models predicted a temperature rise roughly midway between the two extremes. 'The observed trends are sometimes at the upper limit, sometimes at the lower limit, and often in the middle, so that, taken together, the simulations appear plausible. 'In particular, the observed trends are not skewed in any discernible way compared to the simulations,' Professor Marotzke explains. If that were the case, he said, it would suggest a systematic error in the models. The scientists are now also analysing why the simulations arrived at disparate results by looking at how the models react to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Since 1998, the warmest year on record, the steep increase in global temperatures seen during the 1990s has levelled off, failing to match computer model predictions for climate change. This pause, or hiatus, has been blamed on weak solar activity and increased uptake of heat by the world's oceans. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year concluded that the deep oceans had been responsible for absorbing an increasing amount of heat, but warned that this could not continue indefinitely. However, in a paper published in November last year, atmospheric scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that small volcanic eruptions in the early 21st century, which had been largely overlooked, were responsible for up to a third of the hiatus in warming. This schematic shows the trends in temperature and ocean atmosphere circulation in the Pacific over the past two decades. Colour shading shows observed temperature trends (°C per decade) during 1992-2011 at the sea surface.

"There are times in life when the mirror is seriously not your friend, and the moment I catch sight of my reflection as my eyebrows are being dyed is certainly one of them. Clouds of black foam are clumping in gigantic globs, Norman Lamont-style, where I used to have normal arcs of facial hair. Fortunately, there is no cause for alarm. This is merely the first step in the uber-fashionable HD Brows treatment I am receiving, in a quest for striking, Cara Delevingne-inspired arches. My own brows have always been a somewhat shapeless and nondescript shade of mouse, barely tweaked by tweezer and never touched by make-up, despite the amount of slap I habitually trowel on everywhere else. I just didn’t think it would make any difference. Scroll down for video . Kate Battersby (pictured before the treatment), who has rarely plucked her eyebrows or used make-up on them, visited eyebrow stylist Nilam Patel . Now, however, my humble follicles are being tended by go-to eyebrow stylist Nilam Patel, who founded the HD Brows brand in 2008, and whose bespoke technique has seen celebrities trampling over one another for an appointment. Nicole Scherzinger, Mel B and girl band The Saturdays are all on her books. Amanda Holden is the latest of her clients to grab headlines with her dramatically resculpted brows. Two weeks ago she was spotted on the red carpet without the barely-there blonde arches which usually curved above her eyes. In their place she flaunted thick, straight and strikingly darker brows — the result of 18 months of HD Brow appointments, every four to six weeks. ‘She began with really slim brows,’ says 43-year-old Nilam. ‘I convinced her a fuller brow would suit her deep-set eyes and frame her face. ‘So I put her on a regrowth serum and wouldn’t let her tweeze anything herself between appointments. She loves the power brow she has now, though it doesn’t suit everyone — it usually complements a fuller, wider or long face, and also girls who wear minimal make-up, for example Emma Watson and Keira Knightley.’ Cara Delevingne's (pictured in October 2014) famous brows have inspired a trend in bushier and darker eyebrows . Actually, I’m not the biggest fan of Holden’s new look — it’s a tad over-stated for my taste. However, I am intrigued to see what Nilam will make of my weedy brows. ‘I notice everyone’s brows,’ Nilam admits. ‘I talk to their brows. Jennifer Lopez is top of my customer wish-list. Kate Middleton too — I love her, but her brows look too strong for her face, too done. She could do with them lighter and softer.’ I have to apply a patch test at home 48 hours before my appointment to ensure there’s no reaction to the dye, then we begin the first step in the HD process — consultation. Nilam asks if I know what colour and style I’m looking for (my answer: nothing too terrifying) and what my usual maintenance regime is (barely any). Amanda Holden (pictured in December 2014) is the latest celebrity to grab the headlines with her new thicker brows thanks to eyebrow stylist, Nilam Patel . ‘Of course there is only so much we can do with just this one appointment,’ she says. ‘I can get you on track but 80 per cent of clients have to follow a regrowth plan lasting for up to 18 months. ‘When I dye your brows I will include some of the downy, fluffy hair you have around the edge of your brow, then cheat by using some of it to make the brow look thicker. ‘I’ll show you how to achieve the shape with a bit of make-up. We fake it until we make it.’ I am told I should not tweeze anywhere at all after the first session, and that in 12 to 18 months the brows will be much thicker. However, she adds that about 20 per cent of clients never achieve full regrowth and always have to enhance their brows with make-up. I point out what Nilam has, of course, already noted — that my left brow is far more arched than my right. ‘No one’s brows are naturally symmetrical and if they were it would look strange,’ smiles Nilam. ‘That said, I always prefer the shape of one brow, and on you it’s your right. ‘Think of your brow in two parts, the body and the tail. The body — the wider part — should form two thirds of the length, with the tail — the thinner part — as the last third. At the moment the body of your left brow reaches under halfway. ‘Also, the bulb of your right brow begins nearer the bridge of your nose, which I like. So I’ll fill that in on the left to match, and also widen the thin arched part.’ Nilam then starts step two, the custom-blended colouring, by cleansing my eyebrow area and decides on a medium ash brown, from around 100 available shades. For the four minutes or so while the dye is on, I look like the lovechild of Groucho Marx and longtime Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev — and when Nilam wipes off the dye, the resulting brows are startlingly dark. Step three is browmapping, where Nilam judges how much of the tinted fluff can be incorporated into the new brow shape. Step four sees the application of eyebrow wax to the surplus dyed fluff, then step five is the slightly painful threading, which removes the waxed hairs to create a natural look. Her final step is to add pencil and powder to make the brows bolder and fill in any gaps. And after 45 minutes of her hallowed ministrations, I have to admit: I’m a total convert to the church of the HD Brow, singing non-stop happy-clappy hymns to the utterly transformative effect of her method. Nilam says powder brows usually complement a fuller, wider or long face, or girls who wear minimal make-up, for example Emma Watson (left) and Keira Knightley (right) The mirror is my friend again, after all: my unbecomingly small eyes are somehow enlarged by the darker, thicker brows that Nilam has created. Suddenly I understand why I have always looked vaguely peculiar without my habitual heavy fringe — because my eyebrows were so unformed that it almost appeared I didn’t have any. Not any more. Even without make-up, surely the ultimate test of hideousness, I no longer resemble a boiled egg. My previously blancmange-like features have been reframed by new, defining contours. Kate (pictured after the treatment) feels the work done on her eyebrows has reframed her face, giving it 'new, defining contours' I am an instant junkie. I know I don’t want to give this up. Fortunately, there are now around 4,000 accredited HD Brows stylists nationwide, all of whom have paid £1,200 to attend Nilam’s three-day course and receive instruction in the technique. Many HD stylists charge £40 per appointment, so maintenance visits every four to six weeks, as recommended, may require the thick end of £500 a year. Before seeing Nilam, I would have thought that sum an absurd expenditure on eyebrows. But now I completely get it. More to the point, so does my new best friend, the mirror.","Kate Battersby rarely plucks her eyebrows or uses make-up on them .

"A woman was run over and killed by a snowplow at a Massachusetts condo complex moments after the driver offered to clear her parking space following a snowstorm. Cynthia Levine, 57, was struck just before 10 a.m. on Monday in the parking lot at the complex in Weymouth and was pronounced dead at the scene. Her friend, Gloria Moran was with her when she died and said Levine was only outside to help her clean her truck off, according to The Boston Globe. Condo: Cynthia Levine, 57, was struck and killed by a snow plow at Tara Gardens condominiums in Weymouth, pictured here, . Moran told the newspaper: [She said to me] 'I don't want you to go out by yourself, I'll go with you. She added: 'It's a tragedy. It's so sad.' According to police, the incident happened at Tara Gardens condominiums in Weymouth. Weymouth Police were called to the parking lot area of a condominium complex at roughly 9:44 a.m. after receiving a report of the incident. A spokesman for the Norfolk district attorney's office said the plow was owned by a contractor working for condo management. Its thought that the company that owned the plow is called Skinner Overlook. Frank Sullivan, the owner of the company told The Boston Globe the woman’s death was a 'tragic accident’. Moran, said she and Levine had been friends for  six years and got along well as they both lived in the same apartment building. She said that they were outside clearing snow off their vehicles when the snowplow operator pulled up next to them. Once they had pulled their vehicles out, the snowplow driver volunteered to clear their parking spaces, she said. Afterwards, Moran said that once the spots were clear, she started backing Levine's car into its parking space. At that time, Levine told her she was going to speak with the tow truck driver to 'ask the plow guy if he could try not to block us in again with the snow.' But as Levine walked away from the car, Moran said she lost sight of her and she heard a loud thump. Moran said she looked toward the snowplow, which had come to a stop in the parking lot and shouted at the driver: 'Cindy is under the truck!'' The driver jumped out of his truck, rushed over to the victim and pulled her out from under the passenger side of his pickup truck. He was devastated and yelled: 'Oh my God I hit her. I didn't see her.' Other neighbors rushed out to help, but Moran said it was immediately clear her injury was fatal. The driver remained at the scene. But no charges have been filed. However, her death remains under investigation by the police and district attorney's office.","Cynthia Levine, 57, was struck just before 10 a.m. on Monday in Weymouth .

"From pop art to hand-painted leather, monochrome strips and even Seventies fringing, spring is all about the wacky handbag — and this season you’re spoiled for choice. ‘Nowadays your bag doesn’t necessarily have to match what you’re wearing,’ says celebrity stylist Alex Longmore. ‘There are no rules any more — there is so much diversity and so many extremes. Matching handbags and shoes are over. This is the season to go crazy with accessories.’ But however out-there the bag, you’ll be able to carry it off because clothes are more minimalist and more relaxed than ever. Here is our pick of the best . . . POP ART . Eau de Parfum clutch at Next for £28 . By far the biggest handbag trend for spring, this encompasses everything from £1,285 slogan bags at Edie Parker to speech-bubble-shaped clutches at Sophia Webster, £340. On the High Street, there’s the Eau de Parfum clutch at Next for £28, which looks like an upmarket bottle of perfume, or a comic-book-style box clutch, bearing the word ‘Crunch!’, by Skinny Dip at lux-fix.com for £35. ‘If you want to go for the pop art bags, pick a clutch bag, which is more of a nod to the trend,’ says Alex Longmore. ‘This will brighten up a simple black dress and make it look on-trend and fun. Stay away from pairing it with anything too wacky. These bags are brilliant for pepping up a conservative outfit.’ If all of that sounds scary, Anya Hindmarch has some of the subtlest takes on this look, using more chic, muted colours to tone down the kitsch. One bag has a smiley face perforated into soft leather, £950, while another pale blue bag has a pair of cartoon eyes on the flap, £595. If that sounds a bit expensive, Anya Hindmarch also has padded leather stickers for £35 that you can apply yourself, including weather icons, smiley faces, eyes, letters and a victory sign. FRINGE BENEFITS . Saint Laurent Fringe Small Bucket Bag . The fad for fringing is another look to approach with care. Part of this season’s Seventies revival, long suede fringes appear on slouchy, brown hobo bags and can, depending on how you wear them, look boho-cool, rock-chick-radical — or just hippy-horrific. These appeared on Etro’s catwalk, which featured Native American-style beading, and cost more than £2,000, while fringing was on clothes from Celine to Alberta Ferretti. ‘This look is absolutely huge,’ says Alex. ‘It’s already filtered down to the High Street — Accessorize have got an amazing cross-body fringed bag for £65. Don’t wear it with other fringing — keep everything else pared back.’ Zara has a good selection of fringed bags, too, ranging from a £17.99 hippy style, in tan with pink mini-pom poms, to a £99.99 black leather version with chic chain trim. SADDLE UP . Mulberry’s £495 Tessie . Alongside the fringed bag is that other Seventies staple, the saddle bag, as revived this season by its originator Gucci, who sent it down the catwalk over fitted suede outfits, with sturdy webbing straps and the double-G logo canvas. This is less boho than bourgeois, and the difficulty is making it look like it’s not just one you’ve kept from the first time round. Luckily, while the Gucci version is pointedly a shoulder bag, most of the High Street options build on the cross-body style that’s been growing for a while. Classic Seventies brand Tula has a stylish version in tan leather for £125; Mulberry’s £495 Tessie, which looks like a vintage satchel, has been going great guns since its launch; and Vida Vida has a vintage-inspired one for £65 at Not On The High Street. BUCKETS OF STYLE . Zara’s mock-croc version, £99.99 . In a move away from flat totes to more compact shapes, following the dominance of the Michael Kors Jetset last year, the bucket bag — which has a rounder base, giving it that bucket shape, and often pulls in at the top with a cord — has become increasingly popular. Victoria Beckham’s structured version for SS15 combines a rigid cylinder with a soft gathered top and costs £1,050 for the leopard print version, while LK Bennett has its Jenna bag in pink or blue for £450. Get one with a zip pocket inside to avoid too much rummaging around. Zara’s mock-croc version, £99.99, mimics the gloss of the Beckham version. FLOWER POWER . Tincon shopper, £39 . Inevitably for spring, florals are a big trend, and this year they are big, bold and even cartoonish — everyone from Victoria Beckham to Viktor & Rolf splashed stylised flowers across their clothes and bags. Don’t, says Longmore, team them with other florals. ‘Unless you have a really bold look and personality, you could end up with quite a startling clash.’ Ted Baker is no stranger to a flowery print, and this Tincon shopper, £39, would look great dressing up basic jeans. Nica’s ‘Maggie’ print captures the stylised florals that were all over the catwalk, for £45. NOVEL INSPIRATION . Anya Hindmarch’s back-to-school pencil case clutch, £895 . Colour comes into the picture with Burberry’s bright, book cover-inspired clutches on the catwalk, and there is a distinctly bookish approach to Versace’s totes, plastered in pen compartments, and Anya Hindmarch’s back-to-school pencil case clutch, £895, too. A rather more affordable version comes from Not On The High Street, where book-inspired clutches cost £42, or for something really special, Olympia Le-Tan has hand-embroidered box clutches with Disney book covers from around £1,000. These are distinctly tongue-in-cheek, of course, but they look great with bluestocking fashion — simple, slightly gawky dresses, preppy cropped trousers and crisp fitted T-shirts. SPOTS AND DOTS . LK Bennett’s giant-dot Kenzie tote, £225 . If bright hues are not your bag, fear not: monochrome is more fashionable than ever, with stripes and spots all over the catwalks. Armani was a strong advocate for bold monochrome contrasts, but on the High Street it’s one of the easiest-to-find looks, from LK Bennett’s giant-dot Kenzie tote, £225 , to Marks & Spencer’s strong striped tote, £39.50, which wouldn’t look out of place in My Fair Lady’s Ascot scene. Avoid pairing with patterns, because the strength of black-and-white will always overwhelm another print.","This season is all about the wacky handbag .
With pop art and Seventies fringing both having a revival .
It's time to go wild with your accessories, but keep your clothes relaxed ."
"One, two, three, pounce! British photographer Andy Skillen captured the moment a peckish arctic fox at Seal River in Hudson Bay, Canada, tried to break through solid ice in a bid to catch a tasty treat. Images show it starting off on two feet before leaping in the air and head-diving back down. However, the ravenous animal's tactics failed to work and he ended up faceplanting in the snow instead. Skillen said the plucky fox continued his attempts to puncture the frozen surface for almost three hours.

Pick yourself up and try again: However, the ravenous animal's tactics failed to work and he ended up faceplanting in the snow instead - Skillen said the plucky fox continued his attempts to puncture the frozen surface for almost three hours . As a result of limited food supplies in the area, Skillen believed the fox was looking for kelp trapped beneath the frozen ice. He said: 'Unfortunately the fox was not a 1000 pound bear and punching holes in the frozen bay was always going to be an impossible job. 'However he was at least persistent and dogged. 'These pictures have been met with wonder and the sequence was highly commended. 'The Arctic remains a true untrammeled wilderness.' Arctic Foxes can grow up to three feet long and weigh between five and 15 pounds. The species can be found in North America from western Alaska east through northern Canada in the Northwest Territories, Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec. It is also found in the arctic regions of Europe, Asia, Iceland and Greenland. It is an opportunistic eater, usually feasting on small mammals like lemmings, voles, and ground squirrels; birds; insects; eggs; berries and carrion. In the winter, it often follows polar bears and wolves to eat their leftover kill. Let's hope Skillen's fox managed to forage some food in the end. Going hungry: Due to his light frame, the fox was unable to make any headway in temperatures around minus 35 degrees Celsius .

"It was a morning when her velvet and fur coronation robe might have come in handy. The February weather looked a tad too bracing for the Queen yesterday, who grimaced as she ventured out in a north-westerly wind and temperatures just above freezing for a service at West Newton Parish Church in Norfolk. Despite being wrapped up in a dusky pink coat and hat, a white scarf and black gloves, she could not help but shiver as she left the royal car flanked by her husband, Prince Philip.

'The fact is she worries about too many dogs around her feet and the danger she will trip up and hurt herself badly. She is after all 88 and not getting any younger. 'Her corgis are getting on a bit and move along at a sedate speed but a young dog would obviously be very lively and much more active.

"He's been taking daisies and a few pennies to a bench in Wisconsin every day for the past two years to honor his late wife. But after snow blanketed the walkway to the seating area in a Fond Du Lac park it looked as though Bud Caldwell, 82, would have to stop his daily routine. That was until two kind strangers stepped in and decided to shovel the snow-covered walkway. Love: Bud Caldwell, 82, has been taking daisies and a few pennies to a bench in Wisconsin every day for years to honor his late wife . Devotion: Caldwell bought and dedicated the bench to his late wife, Betty, after she died two years ago .

And realizing that he was stranded, they decided to shovel the walkway and keep the path clear all through winter. The employees said that they did it so that the romantic could visit the spot he bought and dedicated to his late wife, Betty, after she died two years ago.

"An extremely rare shark species considered a 'living dinosaur' has been caught off the coast of New South Wales to the shock and amazement of local fishermen. The species, known as a goblin shark, are rarely seen as they typically reside in waters near the ocean floor at around 1,200 metres deep. As they dislike sunlight and prefer the darkness of the ocean floor, they are also known as the 'vampire shark'. However this small specimen was captured in a net by fishermen, Lochlainn Kelly and his father Mike, just 609 metres below the water's surface near Green Cape off the South Coast of New South Wales, and brought to shore at Merimbula to the north, Narooma News reports.

The goblin shark is the last known species of Mitsukurinidae, a family of sharks from 125 million years ago. They ruled that the specimen was two to three years old as it is relatively small at just 1.2 metres in length. A fully grown goblin shark is between three and four metres long.

"An Iraqi man has shot and killed seven ISIS militants in an act of revenge for his son who was executed by the terrorist group, local media reports. Basil Ramadan, said to be in his 60s, used an AK-47 to gun down a group of militants at a checkpoint in Tikrit, a city  northwest of Baghdad currently under ISIS control, before he was shot. Mr Ramadan's son, Ahmed Basil, 18, was one of eight men executed by ISIS in January, accused of infiltrating the organisation and spying for the Iraqi government. Scroll down for video . Revenge: Basil Ramadan shot and killed seven ISIS militants in Tikrit, Iraq, in revenge for the death of his son Ahmed Basil, 18, who was one of eight men executed by ISIS in January (pictured). ISIS released photos from a video of the execution of Ahmed Basil Ramadan and seven others, all said to be police officers,  accused of informing on Islamic State for the Iraqi government. Entitled 'the Day of Judgement', the photos from the video show eight Iraqi men dressed in orange Guantanamo Bay style jumpsuits. Standing behind them are Islamic State's notorious security forces, known for carrying out mass public executions in broad daylight.

"This is the moment a hairdresser was caught on film shamelessly stealing money from her boss's purse - after she set up a secret camera when cash started to go missing. Lucy Horton, 23, who had worked at the salon for seven years, was caught red-handed taking cash and stock worth £410 from mother-of-three Siobhan Meadows, 39. Ms Meadows claimed she was 'devastated' after watching the shocking video as she had been 'very fond' of Horton having trained her - and even invited her to family occasions. Caught red-handed: Hairdresser Lucy Horton is captured stealing money from mother-of-three Siobhan Meadows after the salon owner set up a secret camera . The salon owner said: 'I was devastated when I saw the footage. Three times in one day I caught her on camera in my purse. I was very fond of Hannah, I can't lie.' She told the court that she had been advised by police to install a hidden camera in the staff room of Siobhan Meadows Hairdressing, Hartlepool, after she noticed cash was going missing. Ms Meadows, who herself started hairdressing from the age of 16 before opening her salon in 2002, said she sacked Hannah for gross misconduct after a disciplinary hearing. The betrayed salon owner said afterwards: 'It's terrible when someone I've employed for seven years from them leaving school could breach your trust in the work place. 'Hannah was a fully-trained hairdresser, I put her through her training and paid her as an apprentice, giving her a contract after qualifying. 'The money she took from me was from my own personal money from my purse, it wasn't takings. 'Thankfully it's rare to come across employees like this.' Horton pleaded guilty to the theft in November 2014 at Hartlepool Magistrates Court and offered no explanation for her actions. She was hit with a curfew and fitted with an electronic tag for eight weeks, prohibiting her from leaving her home from 7pm to 7am, and issued with a two-month community order. Thief: Dishonest employee Horton was ordered to pay back a total of £410 to her boss Siobhan Meadows . Long-term employee: Horton had worked at the salon for seven years and was trained by the owner Siobhan Meadows - who even invited her to family occasions . Horton was also ordered to pay £410 compensation to her former boss, £85 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge. Horton's solicitor Tony Jackson said: 'My client is full of remorse about this. She lost her job, her good name and her previous good character. 'She has offered, both at the police station and to the Probation Service, to pay back the money. She could offer no reason for why she did it. She is really sorry.' Chairman of the magistrates bench Martin Slimmings told Horton: 'This is a serious crime that you have committed, it's a breach of trust which is particularly nasty.'

A trooper has met the baby he delivered on side of a Utah road after a mom tried to drive herself to hospital. Pictured: New mother Devi Mariah Ostler and Utah Highway Patrol trooper Josh Carr . Utah Highway Patrol trooper Josh Carr gives a badge to Mariah Ostler's baby boy Sunday . Less than a minute after Carr arrived Ostler gave birth to a 9.9-pound baby boy at the roadside . On a recording of the call, Ostler is initially calm, telling the dispatcher that she's on the freeway, but soon interrupts herself to say her water broke. 'I'm trying to get over into the other lane — I need to push!' she said. She told the dispatcher her name and described her car, then said: 'The baby is coming!' The new baby is presented with a badge on Sunday . The 32-year-old expectant mother pulled over on the side of Interstate 15 as dispatcher Brittney Chugg talked her through the labor, telling her to lay her seat back, breathe and even hold the baby's head so he wasn't born too fast. 'We knew. We just knew it was going to happen. There was going to be a baby on the side of the freeway right then,' said Chugg at a news conference Sunday, according to the Deseret News. Less than a minute after Loveland and Carr arrived she gave birth to a 9.9-pound baby boy. Cars can be heard speeding by on the recording as the baby is born and wrapped in a sweat shirt. 'He came right out in my hands,' said Carr, who told her the gender of the baby for the first time. 'It was very emotional. Probably next to my own children's' birth, it was a very satisfying moment in my career.' He is her third child. Ostler, of Mantua, said the contractions started as she was driving her 6-year-old son at her mother's house, and when they didn't stop she started driving herself to the hospital. 'I knew the baby was coming and it doesn't help to panic. So, I just stayed calm and said, 'Well, if I deliver it on my own then I deliver it on my own. If somebody gets here, somebody gets here. The baby is here. There's not much more I can do about it,'' she said Sunday. She had not picked a name for the baby as of Sunday. The mother and baby were taken in good condition to the hospital in Brigham City, about 60 miles north of Salt Lake City. 'Everyone is really feeling good,' Hawkes said. The baby was due on Tuesday.

Roadside births happen occasionally in the state, especially in rural areas where it's harder to get to a hospital quickly, Hawkes said. Troopers are all equipped with a delivery kit, and when babies are born healthy it's a happy occasions for emergency crews as well. Another Utah woman gave birth to twins on the side of Interstate 80 in June 2013. In that case, 39-year-old mother Lynette Hales was 30 weeks pregnant and taking a last getaway in the Nevada gambling town of Wendover near the Utah border when she went into labor. The first baby had difficulty breathing at first, but both baby boys were flown to a hospital in fair condition.

"Etan Patz's mother has described the last time she saw her son 35 years ago at his alleged killer's murder trial. Julie Patz came face-to-face with Pedro Hernandez, the former shop worker accused of killing the six-year-old boy when she testified at Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday. She told the jury he was trusting but also scared of being lost or alone and broke into tears when she talked about her feelings when she realized her son was missing. Her testimony is the only time she will appear in court because she cannot bear to go through the trial and be reminded of what happened. Tesitimony: Julie Patz, mother of Etan Patz, (pictured in September) told a Manhattan court her son was 'trusting' and terrified of being alone . Family support: Shira Patz, Etan's sister (center) and Stan Patz, his father, arrive at court for the second day of Pedro Hernandez's murder trial . Mrs Patz recounted her time living in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood when her son, Etan, was little. Etan disappeared on May 25, 1979 — the first time he walked to school alone. 'That was the last time I saw him. I watched him walk one block away. I turned around and went back upstairs and that was the last time.' The boy was 'totally outgoing and trusting of everyone — totally nonjudgmental about people,' his mother said. 'Everyone that he met once was his friend and was a nice person.' But while Etan craved independence and was eager to become a grown-up, Patz said, 'at the same time he was very fearful of being lost or left alone by himself.' Julie Patz cried when talking about how she felt in the hours after she learned Etan was missing. 'I don't remember a thing about that night and the next day, quite honestly,' she said. She recalls only having 'very rubbery legs,' an upset stomach and difficulty walking, thinking and talking. Hernandez was a teenage shop worker in 1979 when New York police jotted down his name among those of many people they met during their feverish search. Justice for Etan: Pedro Hernandez (left), pictured in 2012, is standing trial for the 1979 kidnapping and murder of the six-year-old who disappeared on his way to school in 1979 . Emotional: Stan Patz (pictured walking into court on Monday) watched as his wife broke down in tears while recounting the moment she realized her son was missing . Harrowing: Mrs Patz recounted how she watched Etan walk to school on his own for the first time from their Soho apartment (pictured). It was the last time she saw him . But it wasn't until 2012 that Hernandez emerged as a suspect. The apparent breakthrough in the case was based on a tip and a videotaped confession that prosecutors say was foreshadowed by remarks he made to friends and relatives in the 1980s. His defense hinges on convincing jurors that the confession is false, along with suggesting that the real killer may be a convicted Pennsylvania child molester who was a prime suspect for years. In considering evidence that reaches back to 1979, jurors will delve into a missing-child case that helped inject a new protectiveness into American parenting. Etan became one of the first missing children featured on milk cartons. His parents helped advocate for legislation that created a nationwide law enforcement framework to address such cases, and the anniversary of his disappearance became National Missing Children's Day. The trial is expected to last up to three months. In addition to Etan's mother, witnesses are expected to include psychologists, an inmate informant who knows Hernandez, and possibly other informants testifying against the earlier suspect.

"The Queen’s portrait is on display at the airport - but it feels like arriving in Florida, with joggers pounding pavements, jeeps on the roads and dollars in the shops. Then there is the Cayman Islands’ reputation as a haven for hot money - not the most obvious incentive for tourists - and its eagerness to hold huge corporate conventions. But when I ask my Surrey-born diving instructor if he misses Britain, I realise it’s a daft question. After all, it is December and we have just surfaced from a superb dive in coral-rich waters. Now the sun is beating down as we bounce back in the boat towards a perfect tropical beach. It's so money: But there is much more to the Cayman Islands than financial transactions and conferences . Darrin simply smiles: ‘What do you think?’ ‘It’s not cheap,’ the former IT worker adds. ‘But it is beautiful and you can walk down the street at night without looking over your shoulder.’ Tell people you’re going on holiday to the Cayman Islands, and invariably they joke about stashing ill-gotten gains - since this trio of islands, 150 miles south of Cuba, is better known as a tax haven than tourist trap. When my wife and I land on Grand Cayman, the biggest island, one of the first things we notice is the business buzz. Our hotel - one of those huge places with ceaseless activities and bar-stools in the pool - is packed with boisterous Americans attending a giant insurance convention. But looks can be deceptive. For the Westin has some of the best hotel food I have tasted in the Caribbean. And the islands turn out to be a terrific holiday location. Diving is the main attraction, with several fine wrecks dotted around the waters. There are scores of rock tunnels to swim through, and underwater walls close to the shore which - draped in coral - ensure a constantly changing kaleidoscope of marine life. I glide through clouds of silvery jacks, stroke a giant grouper who follows me around - and eyeball fearsomely big barracuda with menacing looks on their fang-laden faces. Then there is Stingray City, where creatures the size of small tables congregate on shallow sandbars at the sound of boat engines. In the past, these hungry creatures swarmed to scavenge when fishermen were cleaning their nets. Now they are deliberately lured with squid so that snorkellers can caress them. ‘You hold them like a pizza box, with two hands underneath,’ says one guide. ‘It feels like stroking a wet portobello mushroom.’ My favourites, however, are the geeky-looking Hawksbill turtles - which, although endangered, seem to be plentiful in these waters. I encounter five on one dive alone. They seem unconcerned as I swim alongside, admiring their striking shells and sharp beaks. These elegant reptiles were also admired by Christopher Columbus, who was the first European visitor here on his final voyage, five centuries ago. He even named the islands Las Tortugas in their honour, claiming that there were so many he could use them as stepping stones to the shore. Later, the archipelago was re-named after its crocodiles. These have since disappeared, but the Caymans can still claim more species of flora and fauna than the Galapagos Islands. It is the only place where I have seen signs that give iguanas right of way on the roads. The most precious of these quasi-dragons is the Blue Iguana - an endemic species which grows up to 5ft long. A decade ago, there were only a dozen left, but an intensive breeding programme has boosted numbers back to more than 1,000. Although not the most beautiful of beasts, they are mostly quite friendly. Totally turtle: Amazingly, the Caymans can claim to have more flora and fauna than the Galapagos Islands . ‘I love these guys,’ says Alberto, the enthusiastic guide who shows us around their pens at the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park. Another morning, we walk the Mastic Trail, a lovely little hike through interior forests filled with woodpeckers, parrots and tree frogs hiding in holes of the creeper- clad trees. Then, after plates of jerk chicken at a cafe hanging over the water’s edge, it is back to an afternoon of lazing - on Seven Mile Beach. Despite the name, this decadent crescent of sand is ‘only’ 5.5 miles long - and also the island’s main drag, lined with smart hotels, small shopping malls and restaurants. As dusk falls, I float in the sea watching a giant cruise ship ablaze with lights. It slips over the horizon under an emerging full moon. Later, we drive to Heritage Kitchen — a tiny shack hidden away on the front serving conch fritters and fried wahoo, served with coconut, hot spice, rice and peas. A meal that is simple and sublime. Next day, we hop on a tiny plane over to Little Cayman — a slip of a place, home to about 170 people. A local provides a lift to our pastel-painted hotel, joking that it is rush hour when we pass another vehicle. We take to the road ourselves, hiring mopeds to chug around this ten-mile island, carefully avoiding the iguana sprawled on the Tarmac. At Point of Sand, at the north tip, we swim and soak up the last of the sun. Then it is time for the chickens to be cleared from the island’s runway and our return to reality. British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Grand Cayman from £695 return. ITC Luxury Travel (01244 355510, www.itcluxurytravel.co.uk) offers seven nights at the Westin Grand Cayman from £1,765 per person based on two adults sharing on a room-only basis, including return flights and private transfers.

"Marjorie Tappenden, 73, admitted causing death by dangerous driving but was spared jail, pictured at Snaresbrook Crown Court . A 73-year-old who killed a cyclist when she accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brake at a junction has been spared jail. Marjorie Tappenden admitted causing death by dangerous driving after mowing down former semi-professional cyclist Kevin Lane, 52, who had been on a 70-mile training ride. The pensioner 'panicked' and hit Mr Lane from behind before sliding into a U-turn with the victim caught beneath the car in Woodford Green, east London. Her Nissan Pixo  came to a halt on the grassy verge  when it hit a bollard and Mr Lane was pronounced dead at the scene in February last year, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Young mother Rachel Cochran who witnessed the crash, said she heard Tappenden crying 'I meant to press the brake, I pressed the wrong pedal,' and said it was clear she was in some distress. She said the car suddenly leapt forward and changed from a normal sound to a heavy revving as if someone had accelerated very hard. Tappenden was given a 12-month supervision order, banned from driving for three years and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £80. Mr Lane's partner Angela Cook said: 'Kevin was my best friend and my life partner and he was taken away without me even having a chance to say goodbye. 'He wasn't someone who just commuted to work by cycling, he loved cycling, he used to be semi-professional and knew everything about cycling. 'He would often chase after drivers and tap on the window and warn them to look after cyclists on the road, he was a very careful cyclist.' Mrs Tappenden and her husband, who suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, had been on their way to visit their daughter in Harlow at the time of the crash. Former semi-professional cyclist Kevin Lane, 52, was pronounced dead at the scene, pictured with his partner Angela Cook . The pensioner 'panicked' and hit Mr Lane from behind when turning right into Woodford Green High Road (pictured) in east London . Karen Robinson, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Lane, as a cyclist, was a vulnerable road user and he had the right of way at the time. 'He was an experienced cyclist, he was riding a well maintained bike and he was training for an upcoming cycling event and he was wearing bright clothing. Tappenden, who was interviewed under caution shortly after the crash, told police she must have pressed the accelerator rather than the brake, and had swerved to try and avoid Mr Lane. Ms Robinson said: 'The pressing of the wrong pedal continued for a long period of time and carried on even after her husband had told her to remove her foot.' Defence attorney Brenda St Prix told the court that Tappenden is a full-time carer for her husband who is almost bedbound, and that she has vowed never to get behind the wheel of a car again. 'She's still having difficulty sleeping since the incident, her doctor has asked her to go on a stronger dose of anti-depressants but as sole carer for her husband she doesn't feel she would be able to do that as it would have an effect on her ability to look after him,' she said. Mr Lane was described as a 'very careful cyclist' who used to be semi-professional, pictured with his niece . 'She's shown remorse and you have seen a copy of the pre-sentence report, so we say that the only aggravating feature was that the cyclist was vulnerable - it was pedal confusion and a momentary lapse.' Judge William Kennedy said: 'There's nothing I can say to make things better - this is a tragedy for both sides and I am desperately sorry for the situation you all find yourselves in. 'For reasons she can't explain, when she got to the junction she quite simply pushed the wrong pedal, instead of coming to a halt the car shot across the junction and collided with Mr Lane. 'Of course it took a few moments for the car to stop and these moments took Mr Lane's life. 'The whole thing was a single error with these dreadful results and Mrs Tappenden is certain that she will never drive again. 'There are no winners here, there are only losers in this room, motor vehicles are lethal instruments and those who drive them are expected to do so with skill and care and so far as is possible that maintains the safety of those on the road. Tappenden is a full-time carer for her husband who suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease and is almost bedbound . 'This wasn't a question of someone who drove over a long period carelessly, unaware or uncaring of other people on the road - it was a few seconds that had desperate consequences.' 'The probation service have heard her remorse and whilst she says this whole thing is a blur blotted out in her mind she will think about this incident every day for the rest of her life. 'From the very first moment she has admitted that she was responsible for this death and I don't think I could say or do anything to this elderly lady more eloquently than she says to herself. 'All of us that drive a car have at one point or another suddenly realised that for a second or two we have not concentrated as much as we might.' 'I am not sending this 74-year-old woman to prison and it's not within my power to do so, it would not be just to do so. 'I order supervision for 12 months because this woman is going to need the support of someone else to deal with that which has happened to her.'","Marjorie Tappenden, 73, admitted causing death by dangerous driving .

"More people now live in London than at any point in history, Boris Johnson revealed today. The London Mayor announced 8.615million people call the capital home, overtaking the pre-Second World War peak. Growing numbers of people moving to London and having children mean than the population is on course to hit 11million by 2050. The population of London has now passed its 1939 peak and is on course to hit 11million by 2050 . London Mayor Boris Johnson today announced 8.615million people call the capital home, overtaking the pre-Second World War peak . The Greater London Authority says this city now has its 8,615,246th inhabitant, the highest population since the eve of the war in 1939. Mr Johnson said: 'London's incredible population boom is testament to the fact that this is the best big city on the planet. 'With more green space than any other European city, a thriving economy, a low crime rate and a roaring cultural scene it is no surprise that London is the place to be. 'As our incredible city continues to grow, Londoners should rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide the homes, water, energy, schools, transport, digital connectivity and better quality of life they expect.' How London has changed: This map shows how London has expanded since 1939 . Country of birth: This graph shows how many more people from other countries now live in London, compared to 1939 . This graph shows how the age of London's population has remained rather steady since 1939, but that we now have fewer teenagers and more pensioners . He called on the government to give London greater control of its finances to fund infrastructure 'that is so vital to stimulate jobs'. Mr Johnson added: 'It is crucial that we recognise the amazing opportunities that this kind of growth can offer and step up our investment now so that London continues to be the motor of the UK economy.' Latest population figures show how London's population has expanded almost 2million people in the last 25 years. The borough of Hillingdon, in west London, has seen the most growth since 1939, up 82 per cent from 159,000 people to 289,000 in 2015. However, in a sign of the shifting shape of the capital, some areas have seen a drop in population. Islington in north London saw a 36 per cent drop between 1939 and 2015, down from 343,000 to 221,000. Barnet likely to overtake Croydon to become the borough with the most residents at almost 400,000 people. Experts have warned that this could add massive strains to already stressed infrastructure, particularly housing and transport. The biggest pressure is expected to be on housing, with an estimated 42,000 new homes needed every year to keep pace with population growth. The last population peak came after two decades of massive growth. But it began to fall almost immediately after the outbreak of war in September. This was largely due to evacuations and conscription. Even after the war, the population continued to decline, amid encouragement from planners for families to relocate. The last time London's population peaked was in 1939, on the eve of the Second World War. But how different was the UK's capital city back then? Currently, 13 per cent of people living in the UK are London inhabitants, whereas the London population accounted for 18 per cent of the UK in 1939. At that time, London was overwhelmingly white - only 2.7 per cent had been born abroad. Today, around 37 per cent of Londoners were born abroad. This shows pre-war areas in blue and post-war areas in red - the shape of London has not really changed . In 1939, with no NHS and heavy smog, life expectancy was 62. Today, Londoners can expect to live to 82. The population pyramid shows London now has fewer teenagers and more pensioners than in 1939. There are also have more adult men, due to a 'missing generation' in 1939, after the First World War. In 1939, statutory education only went up to age 14, so most of London's  secondary schools had yet to be built. Before the war, only 2 per cent of people went to university and almost all of them were men. In London today, 43 per cent of people go onto university and the majority of them are women. Although the number of people working in London has not changed greatly, the industries which cater for those jobs have. The newly-built areas of London in 1939 in blue, with the newly-built areas of London today in red . In 1939, around one in three people worked in manufacturing. Now 90 per cent of these manufacturing jobs have gone and most people now work in industries that barely existed in 1939. These include 250,000 jobs in IT, with another 250,000 working in hotels and restaurants. St Paul's was the tallest building in the capital In 1939. Now St Paul's is only the 41st tallest building in the London. The tallest building is The Shard. House prices have also grown extraordinarily. In 1939, the average cost of a home was the equivalent of three years' salary; now it is around 16 years.

"President Barack Obama claimed on Monday that without a comprehensive budget covering the Department of Homeland Security, more than 130,000 mission-critical employees will be forced to work without pay by the end of the month. They include 40,000 employed by Customs and Border Protection, 50,000 Transportation Security Administration screeners, 13,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and 40,000 Coast Guard personnel. Pay would be restored at the end of any withholding period. 'I know how vital you are, and I want to make sure more Americans know how vital you are,' Obama told an auditorium full of DHS employees Monday the department's headquarters, as the White House rolled out his $4 trillion budget request for 2016. In addition, it's likely that 4,000 people who work for the Secret Service will see paychecks on hold if Obama doesn't strike a deal with Republicans in Congress. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama spoek to Department of Homeland Security employees about his 2016 budget proposal on Monday,  also warning congressional Republicans that he won't accept a spending plan that withholds DHS funding over Washington's epic immigration fight . 'I want to make sure you have what you need to keep getting the job done,' he said. ANNUAL TRADITION: Journalists photographed copies of the president's budget proposal, which is considered a dead letter in Congress . 'The men and women of America's homeland security apparatus do important work to protect us, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress should not be playing politics with them,' he added. Republicans agreed in December to fund most of the government through September 2015, but put Homeland Security on a shorter leash in order to keep their leverage as Obama threatened to implement sweeping changes to America's immigration enforcement policy. DHS’s funding runs out in less than four weeks, and could be stopped entirely if Obama continues to pursue his plan to give residence and work permits to 5 million or more illegal immigrants. GOP leadership calls the plan 'executive amnesty,' and insists that Congress – not the White House – has sole authority to determine who may and may not legally stay in the United States. The president pushed back on Monday as he rolled out the larger budget designed to get America through September 2016. That budget would add $474 billion to the national debt. 'I will not accept a budget that severs the vital links between our national security and our economic security,' Obama said. 'Those two things go hand in hand,' he insisted. But that budget is likely dead on arrival since he is proposing higher taxes on wealthier Americans and job-creating companies. 'Like the president’s previous budgets, this plan never balances – ever,' House Speaker John Boehner said Monday morning. 'It contains no solutions to address the drivers of our debt, and no plan to fix our entire tax code to help foster growth and create jobs.' 'Worse yet, President Obama would impose new taxes and more spending without a responsible plan to honestly address the big challenges facing our country.' Boehner pledged that he would present a balanced budget that 'will help promote job creation and higher wages, not more government bureaucracy.' In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell charged that Obama's budget is a 'top-down, backward-looking document that caters to powerful political bosses on the Left.' Obama's budget includes an unprecedented $478 billion public works program that promises to repair crumbling highways, bridges and public transit systems, largely by providing jobs to Democrats' powerful labor union constituency. Its tax rate on capital gains – investment income – would be the highest in America since 1997. The president is demanding a 7 per cent increase in domestic spending and the defense budget, undoing the fiscal restraint that marked the 2011 budget deal. Obama called those cuts 'mindless austerity.' On Monday he quoted an unnamed Republican whom he said had insisted that if DHS funding were on hold, 'it's not the end of the world.' 'I guess that's literally that's true,' the president said. 'It may not be the end of the world. But unril they pass a funding bill, it is the end of a paycheck for tens of thousands of front-line workers who will continue to have to work without getting paid.' That was different from what he said last week in Philadelphia, when he implied that the department would actually shut down its operations in the wake of a budget impasse. PAYCHECK POLITICS: Obama warned DHS workers that they might have to wait for their salaries after February 27 . 'What do you mean, ""It's not the end of the world""?' Obama said on Jan. 29. 'That’s all you’ve been talking about. And now, suddenly, because you want to make a political point, you think that we can afford to have the Department of Homeland Security not functioning – because of political games in Washington?' The GOP congressman who said it wouldn't be 'the end of the world,' Florida's Mario Diaz-Balart, was referring to the fact that critical functions wouldn't stop. 'It's not the end of the world if we get to that time because the national security functions will not stop – whether it's border security or a lot of other issues,' Diaz-Balart had told Politico. 'Having said so, I think we should always aspire to try to get it done.' Obama was chastened by The Annenberg School of Communications' FactCheck.org website, which declared that he had 'fudged facts in Philly.' So on Monday he focused instead on a temporary stoppage of paychecks, the same phenomenon employees across all cabinet agencies saw in 2013. 'These Americans aren't just working to keep us safe,' he said. 'They have to take care of their own families. The notion that they would get caught up in a disagreement around policy that has nothing to do with them makes no sense.'","Obama warned GOP against holding DHS funding hostage as they fight him on sweeping immigration policy changes that he made on his own .

"With the Baftas taking place this Sunday, we’re all looking forward to seeing the stars in their finery on the red carpet. Everyone always talks about the dresses, but no one sees the hard work that goes into creating the make-up and hairstyles that provide the sparkling finishing touches. Shehla Shaikh, head make-up artist for Lancome, has worked with countless celebrities, including Sienna Miller, Rosamund Pike and Brenda Blethyn. Before: Annie Poulter, 54 (left), and her daughter Rachel, 24 (right), were thrilled to be given a makeover by Shehla Shaikh, head make-up artist for Lancome . As a celebration of Sunday’s ceremony, Shehla met readers Annie Poulter, 54, a nursing home administrator, and her daughter Rachel, 24, a vascular nurse. With a big family anniversary coming up, they were thrilled at the chance of a makeover to suit the red carpet. Annie is a lipstick lover, but doesn’t normally wear foundation as she prefers to go barefaced. She sometimes wears brown sparkly eyeshadow and mascara for a special occasions. Rachel, meanwhile, doesn’t usually wear make-up — only moisturiser — because she has dry skin. Her favourite cream is Waitrose’s Baby Bottom Butter (£3.09, waitrose.com). EXPERT TIPS FOR ANNIE . Choose matte shades in flattering tones such as taupe, brown, bronze or khaki to give a smokey eye. Use the medium tone all around the eyes to frame, and add definition into the lash line by smudging it with kohl pencil. For Annie, Shehla recommended Maybelline's Lash Sensational to define your eyes . Try Lancome Hypnose Star Eyes Palette, ST7 (£37, boots.com). A good budget alternative is the new Collection Eyes Uncovered Palette in Nude Bronze (£3.99, superdrug.com). Emphasise the eyes with mascara — take time to get perfect lashes rather than rushing this, as it gives a lift to the eye. It’s best to avoid messy, glittery eyeshadow, as it falls down into fine lines on your face. Also, steer clear of black — use it only to define inside the water line or with your mascara. Try Lancome Grandiose (£23.50, lancome.co.uk) or the new Maybelline Lash Sensational (£7.99, boots.com). Keep your lips and cheeks neutral, but warm with rosy pink shades. Teaming a warm nude lip with rosy pink cheeks is brightening for the face. Lancome Rouge In Love 240m (£21.50, lancome.co.uk) is perfect. The Lancome Blush Subtil Palette (£28.50, lancome.co.uk) is also a good multi-tasker, as it can be used for eyes as well as contouring and highlighting your cheeks. EXPERT TIPS FOR RACHEL . For Rachel, Shehla recommended L’Oreal Paris Infallible 24H Lip Colour in Red Infallible for a bold lip colour . When you are in your 20s or 30s the rulebook is there to be broken — why not try a bold lip and eye? For subtle glamour, don’t over-do the cheeks. Lancome Limited Edition BAFTA L’Absolu Rouge 160 (£23.50, lancome.co.uk) is a perfect red-carpet choice. Or try L’Oreal Paris Infallible 24H Lip Colour in Red Infallible (£9.99, boots.com). It’s important to use the right brushes, but it’s imperative to make sure you have the right products, such as primer for the skin. Use a primer underneath your foundation to give you an understated dewy finish. Disguise any dark circles by applying concealer in a triangle formation. This will reflect the light and lift your eyes. The new Lancome Miracle Cushion Foundation (£29.50, lancome.co.uk) is great to use when you are trying to do your base in a rush, as you can dab it on to problem areas when you’re on the go. Opt for a taupe matte or peachy bronze eyeshadow, and smudge a waterproof kohl pencil into the lash line. Try Bourjois waterproof Color Band Eyeshadow crayon (£5.99, boots.com) in Beige Minimaliste.

"After spending more than 200 years entombed in a cramped cellar - Britain's oldest yacht has been given a new home. The Peggy, built in 1791, lay in her original boat cellar on the Isle of Man for a century following the death of her first owner George Quayle - before being rediscovered in the 1930s. In a painstaking operation, the historic 26ft vessel was moved to a purpose-built climate-controlled conservation facility this week, in the hope that it will continue to survive the test of time. Scroll down for video . Britain's oldest yacht: After spending more than 200 years entombed in a cramped cellar - The Peggy has been given a new home . Predating the reign of Queen Victoria, the Battle of Waterloo and the death of Mozart, the boat is fitted with sliding keels, one of only a few with this 18th century innovation still in existence. She is also the only surviving shallop - a light boat used for rowing or sailing in shallow water, typical of the 17th and 18th century. Manx National Heritage, the organisation responsible for protecting and promoting the Isle of Man's heritage and culture, have now transferred her from the cellar within the Nautical Museum in Castletown, to a storage unit in Douglas on the Isle of Man. Following a 24-hour delay due to high winds, the 18th century relic was lifted by cradle and then crane, and transported to the recently-purchased climate-controlled conservation facility. 18th century relic: The vessel lay in her original boat cellar on the Isle of Man for more than a century following the death of her first owner George Quayle . Moving home: The Peggy has been has been moved to a purpose-built climate-controlled facility, also in the Isle of Man . Influential: The yacht's first owner, Captain George Quayle (sketched above), was a co-founder of the earliest bank in the Isle of Man and an enthusiastic inventor and traveller . The Peggy will now be stabilised, examined and conserved.Her first owner,Christopher Weeks, Objects Conservator, Manx National Heritage, said: 'It's been six years in the planning. The Peggy, Britain's oldest yacht, was commissioned in 1791 by Captain George Quayle, a prominent politician and banker from Castletown in the Isle of Man. Quayle (1751-1835) was a member of the House of Keys, the directly elected lower branch of Tynwald, the parliament of the Isle of Man, for 51 years. During the wars with France from 1793, he was an officer in successive Manx forces raised for Island defence. He was also co-founder of the earliest bank in the Isle of Man and an enthusiastic inventor and traveller. Qauyle built the vessel her own cellar - where she lay for more than a century after his death. She was rediscovered in 1930, underwent repair work and has since been carefully conserved in her cellar on the Isle of Man. 'We've done a lot of work in preparing the boat, supporting it with a steel cradle and readying the Quayle's dock so that it could accept the boat when we took it out of the cellar that it had been sitting in for 200 years before finally preparing the whole thing for lifting and transportation. 'The main reason that we're moving her is that her fixings have been consumed by rust and we need to arrest that. 'The Peggy is a highly significant vessel and the progenitor for any yacht you' ll see in any harbour in the world. 'It is one of the most important objects that we are responsible for on the Island.' After her rediscovery, structural repair work was carried out during the late 1940s when the vessel was repaired by local craftsmen. This involved the replacement of the keel, stem post and two planks, all of which were damaged when she lay on her starboard side. The Nautical Museum will now undergo partial redevelopment and refurbishment to improve the entrance and shop area with a new 'Quayle Gallery', telling more of the personal story of George Quayle and his family as well as the Peggy. Painstaking operation: The boat is hauled up in the shadow of Castle Rushen in the south of the Isle of Man . Conserved: After her rediscovery, structural work was carried out during the late 1940s when the vessel was repaired by local craftsmen . Recent archaeological investigation and archival research has established that the site was home to possibly the earliest slipway in the British Isles, and that Quayle subsequently replaced this with a unique private dock, which acted as a sea lock. Exhibits will include a number of recent finds from the 2014 excavations including a leather pistol holster, a flintlock pistol mechanism, some coconut shell drinking cups, and what is believed to be an eighteenth century microscope. The Nautical Museum will reopen to the public in May 2015 following completion of the improvement works and the gallery refresh. The vessel, built in 1971, spent more than 200 years in her cellar in Castletown (left) before making the recent trip to a purpose-built climate-controlled conservation facility in Douglas, Isle of Man .

"Denise Fergus says killer Jon Venables should be sent back to jail for blaming her for the toddler's death . James Bulger's mother said today  her son's murderer Jon Venables must be returned to prison after the killer apparently blamed her for the toddler's death. Venables was out partying with friends when he said he and Robert Thompson would not have murdered the two-year-old in 1993 had Denise Fergus kept a closer eye on him, it has been claimed. Ms Fergus, 47, said today his taunts are proof he 'lied on oath' and 'never meant a word' when  he told a parole board he was sorry for his crime. 'I've never believed he was truly sorry for anyone but himself,' she told the Mirror. 'He deceived the parole board and he should be recalled on his licence to be given a lie-detector test to find out whether he ever was truly sorry - if not, he should go back behind bars. 'How dare he try to put the onus back on to me? I was in a shop for 30 seconds and had briefly turned around. It's all on CCTV footage. 'He's already admitted that he and Thompson were to blame.' Venables abducted, tortured and murdered the two-year-old with friend Robert Thompson in 1993 when the boys were both 10. They snatched James from outside a butcher's shop in Bootle, Merseyside, while his mother went into a store for just a few seconds. Venables and Thompson were found guilty of killing Bulger in November 1993 and were sentenced to custody until they reached 18. They were freed in 2001, but by 2010 Venables was back in prison for violating the terms of his release by possessing child pornography. Venables was paroled again in 2013 and took on his fourth new identity. Jon Venables (pictured) and Robert Thompson were both 10-years-old when they shocked Britain by abducting the child, then just two-years-old, before torturing and killing him . Venables and Thompson snatched James from outside a butcher's shop in Bootle, Merseyside, while his mother went into a store for just a few seconds . The pair (pictured left in CCTV footage) walked the two-year-old (right) around the streets of Liverpool for more than two miles, stopping occasionally to kick and punch him . Last week it emerged that Venables was out drinking when he told a stranger in a packed pub that James Bulger's mother was responsible for her son's death - an action that could have put his £1 million secret identify at risk. The killer's identity is protected by a lifelong order and has been changed four times since his release in 2001, costing taxpayers £250,000 each time. Jon Venables got drunk at a party and blamed the toddler's mum Denise for leaving him on his own, it has been claimed. The reveller has told how he spoke to Venables in the 'gay friendly' pub after taking pity on the killer who was getting drunk alone at the bar. He said Venables had been trying to chat up his 56-year-old mother. The man, who has not been named, described Venables as a 'very troubled person' who appeared to want to reach out to someone. The man said: 'It was like he wanted me to know who he was and couldn't help himself. He told me he wasn't allowed a mobile or to go on social networking sites,' he told the Daily Mirror. 'Then something clicked. I was saying to my mum, 'I'm sure that's Jon Venables'. I said to him, 'You're Jon Venables'. And he denied it. The pair began talking about Bulger and the man said Venables claimed the death was 'the mum's fault for leaving him outside the butcher's'. Robert Thompson was also convicted of the young boy's murder. When they were charged, they were the youngest people to face a murder prosecution in the 20th century . Ms Fergus, 47, told the newspaper: 'How dare he try to put the onus back on to me? I was in a shop for 30 seconds and had briefly turned around. It's all on CCTV footage. 'He's already admitted that he and Thompson were to blame.' The man later searched for a picture of Venables online and claims he is 100 per cent sure it was the killer he had spoken to. Last week, Ms Fergus spoke of her fears after it emerged Venables had been allowed to join a popular dating website. She said it was frightening women may have unwittingly contacted him without having any idea of his true identity. Under strict rules put in place following his release from prison, the murderer and paedophile has lifelong anonymity, meaning anyone he speaks to online will not know about his past. Mrs Fergus, who now runs a charity dedicated to her son’s memory, said: ‘It’s quite disgusting that a child murderer and paedophile can have access to online dating websites. ‘I feel so sorry for the girls and women who do not know who they’re chatting to. He’s capable of anything.'","Jon Venables and Robert Thompson murdered James Bulger in 1993 .

"They may seem like an unlikely pairing, but this seven-month-old baby is best friends with a 110lb Great Dane. Vanessa Rowe and Ben Wickens from Stockport, Greater Manchester had feared their dog Harley would not accept baby Isla when she was born in June, but now the pair are inseparable.

Parents Vanessa Rowe and Ben Wickens had feared their dog Harley would not accept  Isla when she was born in June, but now the pair are inseparable . Now Isla and Harley love nothing more than curling up together for a nap on the sofa or playing on Isla's floor mat, and the baby's parents are convinced their dog thinks she is an 'ugly bald puppy'. Isla even learned to roll over by using after patient Harley as support, and if the baby cries, Harley will run off to alert Ms Rowe. Harley won't sleep at night unless she is keeping a close eye on little Isla, and she loves to rest her huge head on the baby's tummy. 'As soon as I said I was pregnant people asked 'what are you going to do about the dog?,' said cafe manager Ms Rowe. Ms Rowe says Harley is so gentle with her baby and says the huge dog is like her 'other daughter' 'But to me she's like my other daughter. I would no more get rid of her than I would Isla. 'But there was no need to worry. 'From day one Harley has been so gentle with this strange little bald puppy we bought home from the hospital and Isla only shows an interest in rolling or crawling if it means getting nearer to her long-legged, floppy eared sis. 'Isla breaks into a smile whenever she sees me or my husband - but that's nothing to the way her face completely lights up when she sees her big sister. 'Isla has got so many toys - all the usual interactive ones - but there is nothing more interactive than a huge dog. 'Harley lets herself be petted, and Isla loves playing with her ears.

'Every worry was made better by her.' The couple fell pregnant a few months later, and adorable Isla was born in June last year. 'We introduced them as soon as we could in the first couple of days, and this huge dog gave this little fragile baby a sniff to try and work out what it was, and that was it,' Vanessa added.

"Many packaged meals and snacks for toddlers contain excessive amounts of salt and sugar that may contribute to obesity and high blood pressure, according to a CDC report (file photo) Packaged meals and snacks for kids have always been a quick and easy answer for parents during a busy day, but they could also be hurting young children. Most pre-made food for toddlers contains excessive amounts of salt and sugar and could contribute to obesity and other health risks, according to a government study released today. About seven in 10 toddler dinners contained too much salt, and most cereal bars, breakfast pastries and snacks had extra sugars, found the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study also notes that almost one in four U.S. children ages two to five are overweight or obese. Foods studied included popular brands of baby food, as well as toddler dinners including packaged macaroni and cheese, mini hot dogs, rice cakes, crackers, dried fruit snacks and yogurt treats - but didn't list brand names. The researchers analyzed package information and labels for more than 1,000 foods marketed for infants and toddlers. And almost 80 per cent of kids ages one to three exceed the recommended maximum level of daily salt, which is 1,500 milligrams. Mary Cogswell, the study's lead author, said that this kind of excess sugar and salt can contribute to obesity and elevated blood pressure both in childhood and later in life. 'Blood pressure tracks from when children are young up through adolescence into when they're adults,' she said. 'Eating foods which are high in sodium can set a child up for high blood pressure and later on for cardiovascular disease.' Scroll down for video . Chicago mom Kathleen Burnett prepares a snack for her daughters Claudia, center, and Sabina right. Burnett said she tries to use moderation when it comes to prepackaged foods, and recently switched brands when she found out her favorite kids' yogurt was full of sugar . One in nine children have blood pressure above the normal range for their age. The study found that although the majority of infant foods were low in sodium, foods for toddlers averaged well above the daily recommended salt intake. Under Institute of Medicine recommendations toddler food should contain no more than 210 milligrams of salt or sodium per serving. The average for toddler meals studied was 361 milligrams - almost 1.5 times higher than the limit. Sodium amounts per serving ranged from as low as 100 milligrams to higher than 900 milligrams. Many foods in the study also contained high sugar content, which is defined as more than 35 per cent of calories per portion coming from sugar. Foods studied included popular brands of baby food, as well as toddler dinners including packaged macaroni and cheese, mini hot dogs, rice cakes, crackers, dried fruit snacks and yogurt treats - but didn't list brand names (file photo) The study found that sugar contributed 47 per cent of calories for infant mixed grains and fruit, 66 per cent of calories in dried fruit snacks, and more than 35 per cent of calories in dairy-based desserts. And about one in three toddler dinners and most toddler cereal bars and dried fruit-based snacks contained at least one added sugar. Added sugars, including high fructose corn syrup, dextrose and glucose, raised concerns because they boost calorie totals without health benefits. 'It's just additional calories that aren't needed,' Cogswell said. One group is fighting the new study that could put parents on edge. The Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade group whose members include makers of foods for infants and toddlers, issued a statement saying the study 'does not accurately reflect the wide range of healthy choices available in today's marketplace ... because it is based on 2012 data that does not reflect new products with reduced sodium levels.' The study 'could needlessly alarm and confuse busy parents as they strive to develop suitable meal options that their children will enjoy,' the group said. Researchers for the study analyzed package information and labels for more than 1,000 foods marketed for infants and toddlers that were available in 2012. They said theirs is the most recent, comprehensive data on commercial foods for young children. One Chicago mom won't be entirely banning prepackaged food from her kitchen, but she does have a strategy for striking a healthy balance. Kathleen Burnett said she tries to buy healthy foods for her three young daughters. She recently switched brands when she found out her favorite kids' yogurt was full of sugar. 'When you're in the grocery store and things seem quick and simple, it's very tempting to take those things, and we certainly have,' Burnett said. 'We just try to use moderation in those prepackaged foods.'","Found that seven in 10 toddler dinners contain too much salt .

"Greece's new radical left wing finance minister arrived for a crunch Downing Street meeting with George Osborne this morning wearing a leather jacket and a casual blue shirt without a tie. Following his meeting with economics professor Yanis Varoufakis, Osborne warned that a euro zone stand-off over Greek debt is becoming the biggest risk to the global economy. He insisted that the meeting  was 'constructive' but described Greek debt as a 'rising threat to the British economy' and called on Europe to 'choose competence over chaos' Scroll down for video . Threat: George Osborne has warned that a euro zone stand-off over Greek debt is becoming the biggest risk to the global economy after meeting Greece's new finance minister Yanis Varoufakis in London today . Varoufakis (right), an economics professor who studied at Essex University, arrived for the meeting in a blue, open-necked shirt and leather jacket, in contrast with the traditional suit, collar and tie worn by Osborne (left) The once-over: It's unclear what the Chancellor is saying but could he be passing comment on Varoufakis's outfit . The Chancellor also publicly urged the anti-austerity finance minister to 'act responsibly' following the meeting, which comes as part of Varoufakis' whistle-stop European tour, in which he is meeting counterparts in an attempt to build support across the EU for a new debt reduction deal for Greece. Varoufakis, who studied at Essex University, yesterday secured backing from France for his country's bid to renegotiate its debt. His meeting with Osborne today was intended to convince Britain to make a similar declaration of support for repayment plans outlined by Greece's new left wing ruling party Syriza. Following this morning's meeting, Osborne said: 'We had a constructive discussion, and it is clear that the stand-off between Greece and the euro zone is the greatest risk to the global economy.' 'It is a rising threat to the British economy. And we have got to make sure that in Europe as in Britain, we choose competence over chaos,' he added. Handshake: The pair exchanged a warm welcome on the doorstep of number 11 . Welcome to Downing Street: The Greek finance minister's distinctive leather jacket was not the usual attire for a high profile diplomatic meeting . 'I urge the Greek finance minister to act responsibly but it's also important that the euro zone has a better plan for jobs and growth,' Osborne went on to say. The election of Syriza last week sent shockwaves through Europe. Alexis Tsipras, leader of the radical left-wing party heading the new coalition, immediately demanded a renegotiation of Greece' £179 billion international bailout deal . Varoufakis opted for a casual look to meet the British Chancellor at Downing Street today, arriving in a leather jacket before changing into a suit jacket, albeit without a tie. Tsipras has also opted for a decidedly casual look since becoming Greece's youngest ever Prime Minister, joking that he won't be seen wearing a tie until Greece's debt repayment is renegotiated. Discussion: Following this morning's meeting (pictured), Osborne said: 'We had a constructive discussion, and it is clear that the stand-off between Greece and the euro zone is the greatest risk to the global economy' Relaxed: Varoufakis opted for a casual look to meet the British Chancellor at Downing Street today, arriving in a leather jacket before changing into a suit jacket, albeit without a tie . Varoufakis secured backing from France for his country's bid to renegotiate its debt during discussions in Paris yesterday, where he began a whistle-stop tour, meeting European counterparts. But German chancellor Angela Merkel has made it clear she will not allow Greece's debts to be cancelled, insisting substantial cuts have already been made. Before the meeting this morning, Osborne said: 'I welcome this opportunity, so soon after the Greek election, to discuss face to face with Yanis Varoufakis the stability of the European economy and how to boost its growth.' Following Syriza shock election last week Tsipras immediately demanded a renegotiation of Greece's international bailout deal . David Cameron initially responded to Syriza's rise to power by warning it would increase 'economic uncertainty across Europe' but later offered the new leader UK help on tax collection. Varoufakis, who studied at the University of Essex, has ruled out a new wave of bail-out support, insisting his government was focused on ending the 'addiction' that has seen Greece 'craving the next dose'. Anger: Following Syriza's shock election victory last week, new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (pictured) immediately demanded a renegotiation of Greece's international bailout deal . New era: Syriza supporters gathered in central Athens cheered after the party won the election last week . Though Britain is not part of the euro, Varoufakis sought to build rapport with Osborne with face-to-face talks. Downing Street said Britain's position is one of continuity - and that Greece should honor the terms of its bailout. Tsipras today struck a more conciliatory tone, meanwhile. He says the Greek people expect him to carry out tough negotiations with eurozone creditors, but 'within a European framework.' Tsipras ruled out suggestions that his government may reach out to Russia for a loan, saying his government's primary objective is to conclude a deal with Greece's European partners and 'all those who have loaned to our country and to whom our country has obligations.' Tsipras said he was surprised many 'powerful European forces' back his government's call for a policy about-face from austerity to growth-oriented policies. But he condemned creditors' demands for painful budget measures in exchange for the loans, saying 'people need room to breathe.' Who is Yanis Varoufakis? The election in Greece of the radical left-wing Syriza party has seen the economics professor plucked from a life quietly writing 'obscure academic texts' to take the political centre stage as his country's new finance minister with the responsibility for fixing its broken economy. He may be new to political life but has already shown himself to be handy with a soundbite, describing the austerity regime imposed by Greece's creditors as 'fiscal water-boarding'. Why is he in London? Mr Varoufakis is doing the round of European capitals trying to drum up support for his attempts to renegotiate the terms of Greece's £179 billion bailout imposed by the so-called 'troika' of the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. His message is the current repayment schedule is simply unaffordable and is stymieing any hopes of a recovery. How has it been going? Not well. When Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurozone ministers, visited Athens it proved to be a distinctly frosty encounter. Mr Varoufakis said that Greece was not prepared to co-operate any more with this 'rottenly-constructed committee'. A testy Mr Dijesselbloem warned him ignoring previous agreements was 'not the way forward'. Mr Varoufakis did receive a warmer reception in Paris, where the socialist government said it was prepared to help his country find a new settlement with its creditors. Who holds the key to resolving the stand-off? All eyes in Europe are on Chancellor Angela Merkel. Germany is Greece's biggest creditor and - to put it mildly - Mrs Merkel has shown no enthusiasm for any debt forgiveness, arguing that creditors have already taken one 'haircut'. She knows German taxpayers see no reason why they should pick up the tab for the Greeks' bills. Expect some tense negotiations over the coming weeks in what looks like coming down to a war of nerves between Berlin and Athens.","Osborne described Greek debt as a 'rising threat to the British economy'

"If you are looking for a loan, serving your bank manager breakfast might just do the trick. A compound found in eggs makes people much more generous, new research suggests. Scientists say that tryptophan, an amino acid found in some foods, can change our behaviour. Psychologists from Leiden University in the Netherlands say that a compound found in eggs (stock image shown) can increase generosity. In their study tryptophan made volunteers donate more money. Tryptophan, which eggs are rich in, is an amino acid that is converted in the body into the feel-good chemical serotonin . In experiments they found that consuming a small portion of tryptophan - the equivalent of that found in three eggs - doubled the sum volunteers gave to charity. Eggs and other foods such as fish and milk are rich in tryptophan, an amino acid that is converted in the body into the feel-good chemical serotonin. The substance is also marketed as a food supplement called TRP. Psychologists from Leiden University in the Netherlands, writing in the Frontiers in Psychology journal, said: ‘For the first time, we investigated whether the administration of a compound contained in food such as fish, eggs, soy, and milk can promote charitable donating. Oxytocin is released in response to physical touch and is associated with maternal nurturing, social attachments, childbirth and sex. It is essential for healthy muscle maintenance and repair. The hormone is injected to induce labour and a new study claims it could one day be used to slow down muscle wasting in the elderly. Research has shown so far that it does not cause cancer when injected and could help old people recover from muscle injuries faster. Levels of oxytocin are high in children, but it is not known when levels of the hormone start to decline and how much is needed to maintain healthy tissues. Previous research found that administering oxytocin helped prevent the development of osteoporosis in mice. ‘Our study is the first demonstration that charitable donating can be enhanced by serotonin-related food supplements.’ The authors carried out an experiment on 32 men and women, in which half were given a powder containing 0.8 grams of TRP, and the others were given a harmless placebo powder. Each participant was given £7.50 ($11.25) for taking part in the research and asked whether they were willing to donate part of their financial reward to charity. Four boxes for Unicef, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and World Wildlife Fund were left on a table. When the psychologists counted the takings, they found that those given the TRP powder donated an average of 75p ($1.15), while those who received the placebo donated half as much. Just how a food supplement could have such an effect is not clear, but the scientists suggest the involvement of oxytocin, the so-called ‘cuddle’ hormone produced by women during breastfeeding and lovemaking. Need a bank loan? Perhaps you should make sure your manager has eaten eggs for breakfast. Just how a food supplement could have such an effect is not clear, but the scientists suggest the involvement of oxytocin, the so-called ‘cuddle’ hormone produced by women during breastfeeding and lovemaking . The researchers point to the closeness of the areas of the brain associated with serotonin and oxytocin. They wrote: ‘It may be likely that the willingness to donate money to a charity is modulated by the effect that serotonin exerts on oxytocin levels. ‘Our results support the materialist approach that “you are what you eat”. ‘The idea [is] that the food one eats has a bearing on one’s state of mind. The food we eat may thus act as a cognitive enhancer that modulates the way we deal with the “social” world.' Commenting on the research, Dr Adam Perkins, neurobiologist at King’s College London, said the study could be useful in prisons to encourage harmony among inmates. He said: ‘These results are interesting because they raise the possibility that dietary supplements containing TRP could be used to assist with boosting charitable attitudes and behaviour in the population.’","Psychologists from Leiden University in the Netherlands say that a compound found in eggs can increase generosity .

Speaking to ABC News six months on, he said it is a 'miracle' he is still alive. 'I'm on borrowed time,' he said. 'My heart stopped, and it remained stopped anywhere between 11 and 13 minutes.' Scroll down for video . Getting ready: Chris LaPak, pictured before taking part in the New York triathlon last August, suffered a heart attack in the water and was clinically dead for 11 minutes. He woke up without brain damage days later . Event: He was swimming in the Hudson River, pictured, on August 3 when he suffered cardiac arrest and started drowning in the water. He was spotted by a lifeguard who took him to a boat . LaPak's parents both died of heart attacks in their 50s  - but by the time he was 52, he had already completed three marathons and had signed up for the triathlon in New York City last August. 'I work out so much,' he said. 'I think subconsciously I thought could beat this whole thing.' Days before the triathlon, he had been at a hot yoga class when he felt chest pain and shortness of breath, but he ignored it. Doctors believe he actually suffered a heart attack, leaving him with an irregular heartbeat, ABC reported. Then on August 3, he planned to swim 1.5 kilometers, cycle for 40 kilometers and run for 10 kilometers in the trialthon, but his heart stopped shortly after he got into the Hudson River at 7am. The next thing he can remember, he was waking up in hospital five days later - but medical personnel have since revealed how their flawless response saved his life. After his heart stopped, he had started to drown and was immediately spotted by lifeguards and fished out of the water onto a surfboard. They then took him to a jet ski and a fire department boat. Fitness buff: Ahead of the triathlon, the 53-year-old had completed three marathons, including the Chicago Marathon with his daughter Christine, pictured. He is now back to running 10 miles a few times a week . NYC Triathlon Lifeguard Director Cary Epstein told Fox News that LaPak had no pulse and was 'as purple as you could ever possibly imagine'. 'I honestly didn't think that he was going to make it in the condition that he was in,' he said. LaPak was rushed to the dock, put in an ambulance and taken to Roosevelt Hospital before he was transferred to Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital. By the time he reached the hospital, he had been clinically dead for 11 minutes, paramedics said. Dr. Eyal Herzog, the director of Mount Sinai St. Luke's Cardiac Care Unit, cooled down LaPak's body to 94.1 degrees F (33 C) to protect his brain before slowly warming up his body again. When he opened his eyes five days later, he was able to tell the time and name everyone in the room. 'Everyone was in shock,' LaPak said. 'My family and friends had been told there was a less than 10 per cent chance I was going to live. And if I did, there was a 95 per cent chance I'd be brain dead.' Dr Herzog said that flawless work from every emergency responder made LaPak's survival possible. Quick-thinking: Dr. Eyal Herzog, the director of Mount Sinai St. Luke's Cardiac Care Unit, cooled down LaPak's body, saving him from brain damage. Dr Herzog said everyone in the field had responded perfectly . Healthy: LaPak, pictured with his wife Renee, is now back at work and has learned to slow down, he said . 'The people in the field were so good, they conducted it like a textbook chain of survival,' the doctor told the Daily Herald last year. 'From the soldier in the field to the expert captain in the hospital.' LaPak underwent double bypass surgery and had a defibrillator implanted. He now runs 10 to 12 miles several times a week and has also learned CPR in case he ever sees anyone in need. In November, he returned to Mount Sinai to meet with those who had saved him, and he became emotional at how thankful he was for their quick-thinking. 'They never quit on me,' he said. 'They gave me an opportunity to have more life and to see my two kids get married and have kids.'

"East Coasters braving snow and freezing rain on their morning commutes Monday won't find any  relief for six more weeks, at least according to clairvoyant critter Punxsutawney Phil. The beloved Pennsylvania groundhog saw his shadow this Groundhog Day, meaning six more weeks of winter. Meanwhile, his big city cousin Staten Island Chuck begs to differ. He did not see his shadow, which predicts an early spring. So which is it? Scroll down for videos . Standoff: Punxsutawney Phil (left) saw his shadow this Groundhog day, while Staten Island Chuck (right) did not . Hands off, de Blasio: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was on hand at the Staten Island Zoo on Monday, where staff told him hands -off the rodent. Last year, de Blasio dropped Chuck's female stand-in Charlotte and the groundhog died weeks later . New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio was on hand at the Staten Island Zoo, where he held a sign declaring 'Spring is coming.' However, de Blasio was not invited to hold the rodent, says the New York Post. When he was afforded the privilege in 2014, he dropped Chuck--actually a female named Charlotte--who died weeks later from internal injuries. Chuck 2.0 was instead kept inside a plexiglass cage. Staten Island Zoo staff claimed it was to prevent another incident like the one in 2013 when then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg was bitten by Chuck during the ceremony. Will the ceremonial change in New York affect Chuck's accuracy? Punxatawney Phil seems to say yes. The handlers of Pennsylvania's most famous groundhog said Monday the furry rodent has forecast six more weeks of winter. Big day: Punxsutawney Phil was brought through a snowy downtown Punxsutawney on Monday to Gobbler's Knob, where his 129th prediction would be announced . Celebration: Revelers in Punxsutawney peruse groundhog themed wares on Monday . Popular: Some 20,000 gather each year in the central Pennsylvania town pop. 6,000 . Ceremonial: Groundhog Club President Bill Deeley taps the door to awaken Punxsutawney Phil, which folklore says can predict winter's end each February 2 .

At right, a groundhog sculpture waves from Punxsutawney's town square . Members of the top hat-wearing Inner Circle announced the 'prediction' Monday morning. A German legend has it that if a furry rodent sees his shadow on Feb. 2, winter will last another six weeks. If not, spring comes early. The forecast was also announced on Twitter, as was referenced in the official proclamation read by Jeff Lundy, the Fair Weatherman of the Inner Circle. 'Forecasts abound on the Internet, but, I, Punxsutawney Phil am still your best bet. Yes, a shadow I see, you can start to Twitter, hash tag: Six more weeks of winter!' The forecast was delivered after a steady pre-dawn rain turned to snow as temperatures dropped from the high 30s to around freezing. They were forecast to keep dropping over much of the state, prompting the state Department of Transportation to lower the speed limit to 45 mph for many interstate highways which were already wet and expected to freeze or be covered with snow as the day wore on. The rain kept some revelers away, with state police estimating the crowd at around 11,000, slightly smaller than in recent years when upward of 15,000 attended. Safe keeping: Staten Island Zoo staff kept Chuck  in a plexiglass enclosure, where he was safe from the mayor's butter fingers . Early spring? Mayor de Blasio held up a sign that declared 'Spring is coming' after Chuck failed to see his shadow--which predicts an early spring . No mention was made of Sunday night's Super Bowl, unlike Groundhog Day 2009 - the last time the celebration occurred the morning after the big game - which was won by the nearby Pittsburgh Steelers that year. Despite the German legend, Phil's handlers don't wait to see if he sees his shadow - as he likely would not have on such an overcast day. Instead, the Inner Circle decide on the forecast ahead of time and announce it on Gobbler's Knob, a tiny hill in the town for which the groundhog is named, about 65 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. Records going back to 1887 show Phil has now predicted more winter 102 times while forecasting an early spring just 17 times. There are no records for the remaining years.","Punxsutawney's beloved Phil predicted six more weeks of winter while his big city cousin Staten Island Chuck begged to differ .

"David Cameron is expected to announce the new policy for schools if the Conservatives stay in power today . Thousands of coasting state schools will be forced to become academies in an ‘all-out war on mediocrity’ if the Conservatives remain in power, David Cameron will say today. Up to 3,500 primary and secondary schools judged to require improvement by watchdogs will be at risk of being taken over by new headteachers, backed by other successful academies or expert sponsors. Downing Street sources said the policy represented a ‘turbo-charging’ of the existing academies programme started by Labour. Currently only schools judged ‘inadequate’ can be converted against their will, while outstanding secondaries and primaries can apply for academy status, which affords them key freedoms from state control. The move suggests the Tories now envisage that all schools will ultimately become academies, free from local authority control. It also appears to be an attempt to drive another wedge between Ed Miliband and senior Blairites in his party, who have long despaired of how he has ceded ownership of the academies programme to the Coalition. The Tory election push on schools policy comes after Education Secretary Nicky Morgan indicated the party would protect her budget from austerity measures for another five years. The Tories also plan to raise standards by making all schoolchildren in England learn their times tables by heart as well as carry out long division and complex multiplication by the age of 11. They will also have to be able to read a novel and write a short story. Many schools already expect pupils to meet these targets, but all will be expected to pass tough tests before leaving primary school as part of a ‘war on illiteracy and innumeracy’. Mr Cameron will say today: ‘As parents we’re hardwired to want the best for our kids. No one wants their child to go to a failing school – and no one wants to them to go to a coasting school either. So this party is clear. “Just enough” is not good enough. That means no more sink schools – and no more “bog standard” schools either. ‘We’re waging an all-out war on mediocrity, and our aim is this: the best start in life for every child, wherever they’re from – no excuses.’ Labour allowed failing state schools to be converted into academies and taken over with new leadership, with impressive results. The Coalition extended the policy by allowing the most successful schools to apply for academy status, which gives them freedom over their budgets, the national curriculum, term dates and staff pay. Around half of all secondaries and one in ten primaries is now an academy. Under a Conservative government, any school judged as ‘requires improvement’ would automatically be considered to become an academy. Nicky Morgan indicated the Conservatives would protect her budget for schools in the next five years. Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt however said the policy was 'damaging the education system' Only if they can set out a clear plan for rapid improvement, as judged by their Regional Schools Commissioner, would they remain under their existing leadership. And any school judged as ‘requires improvement’ that is already an academy or a free school may be forced to accept a new sponsor. Mrs Morgan said yesterday she believed more rigorous standards would propel England to the top of the class in European league tables for English and maths by 2020, as well as in the top five internationally – a significant leap from the current ranking of 23rd. As well as demonstrating mathematical skills, 11-year-olds will have to pass a writing test by showing they can use ‘accurate punctuation, spelling and grammar’. Headteachers who fail to ensure the standards are met face being sacked if the Conservatives are returned to power, she indicated. ‘I think that’s what parents and families would expect as a minimum from our exam system,’ Mrs Morgan told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme. ‘We have to be ambitious for our young people, if we don’t get it right at primary then it becomes much harder for children to catch up when they are in secondary schools.’ Asked whether the schools budget will be protected, Mrs Morgan said: ‘We’re going to have more to say on schools funding very shortly but what I can say is that I am absolutely fighting for the schools budget to be protected.’ Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt said: ‘David Cameron’s flawed schools policy is damaging our education system and failing to close the learning gap between disadvantaged children and the rest.’ j.chapman@dailymail.co.uk .","The Prime Minister is expected to announce new policy for schools today .

"Burglars used scaffolding poles in a bid to smash their way in to the home of Manchester United star Angel Di Maria as he ate dinner with his family. A gang of three armed thugs are reported to have used the metal poles in an attempt to break through patio doors at the Argentine's mansion in Cheshire. The 26-year-old is said to have been eating dinner with his wife Jorgelina Cardoso and young daughter Mia when the terrifying raid unfolded. Angel Di Maria (pictured left in his Lamborghini in December) is said to have been eating dinner with his wife Jorgelina Cardoso (right) and young daughter when the terrifying attempted raid unfolded . Di Maria, pictured left with Jorgelina in December and right in action for Manchester United against Leicester on Saturday, was shadowed by a security guard on Sunday . The gang reportedly used  metal poles in an attempt to break through patio doors at the Argentine's mansion in Cheshire (pictured) According to The Sun, the incident happened at around 7.30pm on Saturday, just hours after Di Maria had starred in Manchester United’s 3-1 victory over Leicester City at Old Trafford. The family, said to have been left shaken by the ordeal, were whisked away by bodyguards after a team of security guards were dispatched to the player's home. They were later transferred to a hotel in Manchester while investigations got underway. A source told the newspaper that none of the raiders entered the house because the alarm went off when they attempted to smash the patio doors and that when police turned up they were 'long gone'. 'From what I heard Di Maria and his family were very shaken up - as you would be,' the source added.

Di Maria was shadowed by a security guard on Sunday as he drove from the hotel in his Range Rover, while images of his property showed a window boarded up. The former Real Madrid midfielder’s agent confirmed the incident yesterday. Cheshire police have confirmed they are investigating reports of a burglary, and have urged members of the public who have information on the incident to contact the force, or Crimestoppers. 'At 7.30pm on Saturday, January 31, police received reports of a burglary at a house in Prestbury,' a spokesman told MailOnline. 'A number of offenders tried to gain access to the property by trying to smash the back door. The alarm was raised before the men got inside and they fled the scene.' The Argentina international signed for Manchester United from Real Madrid in August for a British record transfer fee of £59.7million, moving to Cheshire with his wife, who he married in 2011, and daughter, who is almost 22-months-old. Little Mia was born three months premature on April 22, 2013 - the night before her father's then team Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in a Champions League semi-final. Di Maria missed the game to be with his wife and their baby spent the next two months in intensive care before the couple were allowed to take her home. Following Real's Champions League win over Atletico Madrid, the footballer said of his little girl: ‘My daughter taught me that everything that appears to be really difficult can end up being easy if you put the effort in and wait for the rewards. ‘She transmitted so much energy to me and it helped me to have the spectacular year that I had.’ Little Mia was born three months premature on April 22, 2013. He and his wife have backed charity Unicef's campaign to raise awareness of premature babies . The tot, who is now nearly two, sports an Argentina strip with her father's number on the back . Di Maria’s wife Ms Cardoso had suffered pregnancy complications and doctors had given the couple’s baby a 30 per cent chance of survival if the birth was not induced . The footballer, pictured with his wife, put his success with Real Madrid last season down to the lessons he has learned from his baby daughter . When Mia celebrated her first birthday in April, Di Maria and his wife invited all the parents they had met during their time with Mia at Madrid’s Monteprincipe Hospital, and their children. The couple have also backed charity Unicef’s campaign to raise awareness of premature babies. On Mia's first birthday, Ms Cardoso, 32, wrote on her Instagram account: 'Nobody but Dad and I know how painful it was to see your face covered with medical cables. There is nothing sadder than to go home from the hospital with empty arms. Tears soaked our pillows every night. And now we can say that you are a strong, healthy, happy girl. You won the battle for your life, for our lives.' Due to its proximity both Manchester and Liverpool, Cheshire is popular with Premier League footballers and several players' homes have been targeted by burglars in the past. Everton and England defender Phil Jagielka was robbed at knifepoint at his home near Knutsford in 2009. Stoke striker Peter Crouch suffered two break-ins, in 2011 and 2006, at two properties he's owned in Cheshire. United star Darren Fletcher's wife and mother were threatened with a knife when raiders burst into their home in Bowdon in 2009. And the wife of Bolton striker Emile Heskey was also held at knifepoint when a gang raided their mansion in Hale during his time with Wigan Athletic in 2008. The series of raids led to claims that top footballers were installing panic rooms in their homes.

"A controlling boyfriend murdered his  girlfriend by stamping on her head after she refused to give him her Facebook password, a court has heard. Kane Boyce is accused of murdering  Paula Newman in 'a violent rage' at the home they shared in Croydon, south London, after allegedly becoming convinced the 20-year-old was cheating on him. The 34-year-old denies murder, claiming the woman died after falling out of his BMW during a late-night drive. Today the Old Bailey heard how Miss Newman was heard by neighbours 'shrieking' as the defendant shouted at her to hand over her social media passwords on November 13, 2013. Kane Boyce is accused of murdering his 20-year-old girlfriend Paula Newman by stamping on her head when she refused to give him the password to her Facebook account . They are then thought to have driven in Boyce's car, later returning to the property where neighbours noticed Miss Newman, who had mild learning difficulties, was 'visibly unwell'. Paramedics were called to the property the following day but were unable to revive Miss Newman, who weighed under 9-stone. A post-mortem examination revealed she died as the result of head injuries. Prosecutor Gillian Etherton told the court how Boyce had become 'obsessed' with the victim's social media accounts in the weeks before her death. 'This defendant is a man who is jealous, obsessive, controlling, and violent’, said prosecutor Gillian Etherton QC. ‘The defendant, in a violent rage, beat and it would appear kicked or stamped on Paula’s head causing her severe and irreparable brain injury which brought about her death.’ On the night before her death Boyce was allegedly heard revving the engine of his car and threatening: 'If you don't log on (to Facebook), we'll see what happens.' He is alleged to have told a friend: ‘I've asked her for this Facebook account and she won’t give it over to me for love nor money,' and also wrote social media posts accusing the woman of cheating. As Miss Newman was being treated by paramedics, he accessed her account and voicemail from a mobile phone, it was claimed. The court heard how Boyce had become 'obsessed' with his girlfriend's Facebook accounts in the weeks before her death (file image) ‘In the weeks prior to Paula’s death, and indeed at the time of her death, this defendant became obsessed with getting access to Paula’s Facebook accounts’, said Ms Etherton. 'Evidence shows that her phone was used to access or attempt to access a number of sites between 4.59am and 6.20am, a time when we know she would have been incapacitated due to the severity of her injuries. ‘We know that this defendant left Dunsfold Way while the paramedics were there attempting to save Paula’s life. ‘We know Paula Newman’s phone being used to check her voicemail at 6.54am and 7am.' In the weeks before her death Miss Newman is said to told a friend she was planning to leave Boyce whom she met when the pair moved in to the same home. 'It appears that at the beginning of their relationship, the defendant treated Paula well and gave her gifts, but within a few months this changed’, Ms Etherton added. ‘The relationship was up and down to say the very least. ‘By the end of the summer, Paula was confiding in those close to her that they were serious problems in the relationship, they were arguing, she told those close to her that the defendant was controlling, abusive and possessive and she was unhappy.’ Stefani Taylor, a friend of Ms Newman, told police: ‘He had complete control of her and I have never seen her like that before. ‘I pleaded with her to leave him but she would always say she loved him.' Just four days before her death, the victim asked a friend to help her move out of the property she was sharing with Boyce in New Addington. The pair had only been together for seven months after meeting in Beckenham, south London. Three days after his girlfriend's death, Boyce allegedly bought a new phone after being released on police bail to change his relationship status on Facebook to 'single'. He also logged onto her Zoosk dating profile, it was claimed. The 34-year-old has a history of violence towards women, it was alleged, and was described as 'manipulative'. Boyce denies murdering Paula Newman. The trial at the Old Bailey in central London (pictured) continues . ‘This defendant has the ability to charm women’, said Ms Etherton. ‘However, when we dig deeper into his history the evidence shows that over the years when it suits him he can and often has behaved towards his partners in a sadistic and cruel way. ‘He is capable of being manipulative, very controlling, and extremely violent to previous partners. ‘Previous attacks on different partners include repeated serious violence, such as punching and kicking to the head and body.’ ‘Kane Boyce was alone the aggressor that night, driven by jealousy and anger about Paula’s Facebook activity and in the build up to her death, and on the day of her death he was aggressive and threatening about this activity. ‘In the early hours of November 12, Paula received not a single push causing her to fall but a sustained beating at the hands and very likely foot of this defendant, causing her severe head injuries and resulting in her untimely death.’ When questioned by police Boyce told investigators Miss Newman died after jumping out of his moving car. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denies murder. The trial at the Old Bailey continues.

"From next year, children in Finland will not be compulsorily taught cursive handwriting. Instead of learning this skill, schools will be given the choice to teach keyboard typing in its place. The country's education board said the change reflects how typing skills are now more relevant than handwriting, but experts claim the move could damage a child's brain development. From next year, children in Finland will not be compulsorily taught cursive handwriting (stock image). Instead of learning this skill, schools will be given the choice to teach keyboard typing in its place. The country's education board said the change reflects how typing skills are now more relevant than handwriting . The changes don't officially come into force until the start of next year's autumn term. Minna Harmanen from the National Board of Education told Savon Sanomat that 'fluent typing skills are an important national competence'. It follows changes made to the Common Core Standards Initiative in the US, in September 2013, in which the US similarly removed cursive handwriting as a compulsory skill. As of last year, 43 states had adopted the standard, Maryland had endorsed it, Indiana had withdrawn, Oklahoma and South Carolina had repealed it, and the rest of the states were non-members or had not adopted it. North Carolina additionally passed the Back to Basics bill to reintroduce cursive into the classroom, which led to a number of complaints. A predominant criticism is that, while handwriting is important, cursive handwriting is no longer deemed necessary. 'Most [people] would agree that everyone should at least be able to pick up a pen or pencil and craft a message that others can read,' said Misty Adoniou, senior lecturer in language, literacy and TESL at University of Canberra. 'But beyond legibility, does it matter how you form your letters when you hand write?' She continued there is research linking fluent handwriting with better written compositions, 'but the key isn’t the quality, form or style of the handwriting, but rather the automaticity of the handwriting.' Reports have found that by the age of eight, children can already type faster than they can handwrite. But, further research said that learning to write in cursive improves a person's motor and visual skills, eye-to-hand co-ordination, spatial awareness, hand and finger dexterity, cognitive function and brain development . Automaticity is the theory that the less a person has to concentrate on forming their letters correctly, the more brain space they can devote to getting their message right. However, writing automaticity is just as easily achieved on a keyboard, and Ms Adoniou said it's more time efficient to teach a child to type than it is to teach them a particular handwriting style. In a recent study from Indiana University, researchers conducted brain scans on five-year-olds before and after receiving different letter-learning tasks. In children who practiced writing letters by hand, the neural activity was more enhanced and 'adult-like' than in those who had simply looked at letters. And, the brain’s so-called 'reading circuit' - a region of linked connections that become active when reading - was activated during handwriting, but not during typing. Reports have also found that by the age of eight, children can already type faster than they can handwrite. But, as Ms Adoniou acknowledged, handwriting can play a crucial part in brain development. 'Although the ease, speed and versatility of technology are widely acknowledged, handwriting proponents say that how we learn to write does indeed matter. 'Research indicates that learning to write in cursive further improves students' motor and visual skills, eye-to-hand co-ordination, spatial awareness, hand and finger dexterity, cognitive function and brain development. 'They say the physical act of handwriting also facilitates the retention of information and the flow of ideas.' For example, in a recent study from Indiana University, researchers conducted brain scans on five-year-olds before and after receiving different letter-learning tasks. In children who practiced writing letters by hand, the neural activity was more enhanced and 'adult-like' than in those who had simply looked at letters. And, the brain’s so-called 'reading circuit' - a region of linked connections that become active when reading - was activated during handwriting, but not during typing. Graphology is the study of handwriting. Graphologists analyse the physical characteristics and patterns of handwriting and make assumptions about their identify, including the person's mental state, as well as personality traits. Writing consists of three things - movement, spacing and form - and a graphologist studies these variations and attaches interpretations to them. Graphologist Adam Brand recently analysed the handwriting of the MailOnline Science team as part of the Signature campaign from Thomas Cook. Graphologist Adam Brand recently analysed the handwriting of the MailOnline Science team. He said: 'Rachel is a friendly, sociable and balanced', seen by the right slant of the script (1), close word spacing (2) and rhythmic nature. 'She has mental drive' seen by the long ‘t’ bar (3) and stubborn determination to do an accurate job', denoted by the ‘d’ structure (4) and the straight zone (5 and 6) 'Although prepared to look at the unfamiliar, represented by the high ‘i’ dot (1), Vicky is practical and likes to focus on short range projects' - seen in the low ‘t’ bars (2).

'The reason is that our personalities affect the way our handwriting develops after we were taught to write. 'This is because handwriting is the pattern of our psychology expressed in symbols on the page and these symbols are as unique as our own DNA.' However, despite the fact it has previously been used in court cases as a form of forensic evidence, the practice is deemed controversial and has been dubbed a 'pseudoscience.'

'He is unlikely to act impulsively' seen by the rising ‘m’ at (4) and is 'sensitive to criticism which motivates him to set high standards', represented by the open ‘t’ stem (6). His twisted slants (7) show he likes to verify ideas . Mr Brand's analysis said Sarah's style shows she's active, seen by a fast, right slant (1), who works well in fast-moving environments. This is represented by the right-placed 't' bar (2) and angles (3). He added that her writing falls below the line (4) suggesting she is weighed down by her responsibilities . Other points that Mr Brand noted during the analysis is that close and overlapping lines show a need to be involved in a mass of different projects. Ascending base lines show energy, enthusiasm and initiative, while extremely long 't' bars show a need to move forward with new ideas that come along. He added that small writing shows a good ability to concentrate but can also suggest an introverted person, and slant changes and a sudden upsurge in height shows impulsiveness. Curved, looped rhythmic writing shows altruism, friendliness and a sense of balance. And it pressure of the writing increases towards the end of words it symbolises increased commitment to a project as time goes on . A tall ‘k’ structure shows defiance, and if letters reach down into the lower zone that represents the area of materialism. In a recent study from Indiana University, researchers conducted brain scans (pictured) on 5-year-olds before and after receiving different letter-learning tasks. In children who practiced writing letters by hand, the neural activity was more enhanced and 'adult-like' than in those who had simply looked at letters . Earlier this year, LeapFrog’s learning designer Dr. Jody Sherman LeVos told MailOnline that schools are already ditching pens and paper for tablets. She said there is an emerging focus on skills that go beyond the core curriculum, including skills such as collaboration, grit and perseverance, music and creativity, and problem solving skills. ‘Technology can encourage and support numerous child development and educational objectives, such as physical activity and health,' explained Dr LeVos. 'And there is a body of research supporting the notion that children learn best when they’re having fun.' But as Ms Adoniou concluded: 'With so many things to do in a school day, it is hard to see why dedicated handwriting lessons persist. 'No matter how standardised we attempt to make handwriting, we all end up with our own style. 'So perhaps there are better things to do in the school day than have children complete pages of handwriting exercises. 'Perhaps we’d do just as well to let children play with drawing and writing implements and find their own style.'","From 2016, Finnish schools won't compulsorily teach cursive handwriting .

"The Super Bowl may be over but it seems there's plenty of hot air left in the 'deflate-gate' controversy with even the President chiming in. In an interview with NBC prior to the big game, President Obama said the inflation levels had no discernible impact on the Patriots' 45-7 win over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship Game. He said he was stunned to learn that each NFL team controls its own game footballs. Surprised: President Barack Obama tackled Deflategate ahead of Super Bowl XLIV saying he was stunned to learn that each NFL team controls its own game footballs . Blunt: Speaking with NBC's Savannah Guthrie, President Obama said the inflation levels had no discernible impact on the Patriots' 45-7 win over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship Game . Keeping quiet: President Obama did not make a prediction for Super Bowl XLIX between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, although he did forsee the game being a close one . The President spoke to NBC's Savannah Guthrie before hosting a Super Bowl party at the White House for his friends on Sunday. Lighter topics were covered in a short segment that aired live in the pregame show. As Guthrie and Obama sampled White House-brewed beer from the executive mansion's kitchen, they mixed a discussion of the game's high-profile controversy — deflated footballs — with a brief discussion of politics. But the president ducked picking between possible 2016 Democratic presidential contenders Joe Biden and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 'Love 'em both,' Obama said with a smile. He also wouldn't pick a favorite in the New England Patriots Super Bowl match-up against the Seattle Seahawks. 'I think it's always wise for me not to choose a team because then I just alienate one big city,' Obama said. As the NFL investigates how the Patriots used the deflated balls in their 45-7 AFC championship victory, Obama said the team would have defeated the Indianapolis Colts 'regardless of what the footballs looked like.' 'The one thing I did not realize — and I'll bet most fans didn't — was that each team prepares its own footballs and brings them to the game,' Obama said. How it started: Tom Brady of the New England Patriots throws a touchdown pass during the AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts, the game at which the deflate-gate saga began . Inquest: The NFL is investigation whether footballs were deflated in the New England Patriots' win over Indianapolis . 'I don't think there's any other sport like that so I'm assuming one of the things the NFL is going to be doing just to avoid any of these controversies is figuring out how the officials are in charge of the footballs from start to finish.' Pressed on whether the Patriots were cheating, Obama said: 'I think that if you break the rules then you break the rules.' The president rejected the idea he was doing his own end zone dance with a defiant State of the Union address after Democrats lost seats in the midterm election. 'My job is not to trim my sails,' Obama said, confidently arguing for his ability to win over even some of his political rivals. He spoke on the eve of his presentation of a budget to Congress, where his proposals are certain to get a rough reception from the Republican majority. 'One thing I've learned over the last six years is that when I tell the American people very clearly what direction I think the country should go in, sometimes people change their minds,' Obama said. 'And even Republicans occasionally start agreeing with me, although sometimes a little bit later than I would like.'","'Here's what I know.

"It may be known for its rude waiters, but Paris is today celebrating after another of its restaurants was awarded three Michelin stars. Chef Yannick Alleno, who runs the Pavillon Ledoyen in central Paris, was crowned with the coveted three stars in the Guide's latest France edition. There are now 609 Michelin-starred restaurants in France – one fewer than last year, although the capital city has gained a new three-star restaurant. Scroll down for video. Yannick Alleno, chef at Le Pavillon Ledoyen, gets three Michelin stars as the group released its 2015 edition . Pierre Gagnaire . Epicure au Bristol . Le Pré Catelan . Guy Savoy . Pavillion Ledoyen . L'Ambroisie . Le Meurice Alain Ducasse . Astrance . Arpège . Paris alone had nine three-star restaurants, including the Pavillon Ledoyen, under a new chef Yannick Alleno in the kitchen. 'We found a Yannick Alleno at the top of his game,' said Mr Micheal Ellis, director of the international guides for Michelin, who singled out for special praise a soufflé of smoked eel with a watercress reduction, The Telegraph reported. The 46-year-old had already received a three-star rating in 2007 for his cooking at the Hotel Le Meurice, which he left in January 2013. Restaurant La Bouitte, in Saint-Martin-de-Belleville in eastern France, helmed by chefs René and Maxime Meilleur was also awarded the exclusive three-star rating. French chefs Rene, left, and his son Maxime Meilleur, center, who run La Bouitte restaurant in the French Alps, and Yannick Alleno, who runs Le Pavilon Ledoyen restaurant in Paris . The father-and-son team Rene and Maxime Meilleur were described as 'extraordinary.' Their 'extraordinary' skills with fish, and their meals were hailed as 'generous, authentic and full of emotion,' by Mr Ellis. In all, 609 French restaurants received at least one Michelin star this year. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who is also in charge of tourism planning, introduced this year's Michelin guide to the country's best restaurants. The gala celebration of French cuisine underlined the message that France aims to cater to visitors who come for the food. Facade of Chef Yannick Alleno's gastronomic restaurant Pavillon Ledoyen . The news was announced on the official Michelin Twitter account . Michelin was hoping to encourage more road trips - and thus more tire sales - when it started its guide in 1900. At the time, the free book also had listings for gas stations, mechanics and hotels as well as city maps. Today, Michelin has a multitude of guides, some focusing on restaurants, others with a range of tourism-related listings. The company has expanded to include separate versions for New York City, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Macau. The 2015 guide crowned 80 two-star restaurants, seven of which were new, and 503 one-star restaurants. France has 29 three-star restaurants, nine of which are in the capital. The three previous editions of the guide crowned one new three-starred chef each and none in 2011. Last year, the most coveted accolade in gastronomy went to Arnaud Lallement, of the family-run L'Assiette Champenoise near Reims in northeastern France. The new guide was unveiled at the French foreign ministry on Monday 2 February. Star ratings for restaurants in other counties will be published at different dates in the coming months. The criterion for winning three stars is that the restaurant must serve up 'exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey'.","Chef Yannick Alleno of Pavillon Ledoyen, Paris, crowned with three stars .

"Election case: Lutfur Rahman, who runs Tower Hamlets Council (pictured campaigning last April), 'subverted democracy' during a campaign characterised by bribery, 'ghost voting', smears and 'foul libel', the High Court heard . Britain's first elected Muslim mayor was accused in court yesterday of running a ‘den of iniquity’ and systematically stealing votes. In a rare electoral fraud trial, Lutfur Rahman is alleged to have ‘subverted democracy’ by masterminding a campaign of corruption and intimidation to rig his re-election last year. Muslim voters were left in tears at the ballot box after being warned it was a ‘sin’ not to back the controversial mayor, the High Court heard. Barrister Francis Hoar said: ‘Mr Rahman has been the most senior elected executive in Tower Hamlets for almost seven years and mayor for over four of them. ‘Yet Lutfur Rahman expects this court to believe that he was unaware of any corruption, any malpractice, any foul play. 'That he knew nothing of the false registration of voters, of the diversion of public funds to pay for his support... or of fraud. An innocent amidst a den of iniquity. Only this court may now judge.’ Mr Hoar added that anyone who challenged Rahman’s crooked practices was branded ‘racist or Islamophobic’. But after neither the police nor any other public body challenged Rahman, a private petition was launched by four residents of Tower Hamlets, which was described as a ‘rotten borough’ by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles last year. Andrew Erlam, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussein and Angela Moffat face a six-figure legal bill to bring their action. Mr Hussein, a local restaurateur, said they had even been charged £6,000 by the police to obtain documents in support of their private case. The court heard that the children of electoral rivals received death threats on their mobiles, postal ballots were doctored, elderly voters were manipulated and an army of ‘ghost voters’ was registered. Rahman allegedly funnelled hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money to organisations run by his cronies. Rahman, 49, won the poll in May with 51.8 per cent of the vote. He had formed his own party, Tower Hamlets First, after being expelled by Labour. Yesterday the four campaigners sat in court as their barrister Mr Hoar opened the case before Electoral Commissioner Richard Mawrey QC. The electoral judge said £65,000-a-year Rahman – who did not attend yesterday’s hearing – would be stripped of his mayoralty if the allegations were proven. Mr Hoar said his clients had lined up 100 witnesses, but many had reported ‘threats of violence, threats to their families in Bangladesh, pressure from their employers and pressure from their communities’. Some were so afraid, they would not take the witness stand even if ordered by the judge, he added. Mr Hoar said: ‘Since the beginning of his political career, he has been prepared to take whatever steps, use whatever means, recruit whatever support, to obtain power – power for himself, power for his friends and most importantly, power over his community.’ He said the evidence would show Rahman to be ‘a liar and perjurer’, and claimed there was ‘overwhelming evidence’ that he was aware of, and encouraged, the corruption. Quoting ancient Greek playwright Sophocles, he added: ‘Lutfur Rahman would not “rather fail with honour than succeed by fraud”.’ Opposition: Four residents, Andrew Erlam, left, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussein, right, and Angela Moffat, plan to call 100 witnesses to prove the election was rigged . Historic: The High Court is hearing the rare electoral trial, which could result in a new election, mayor Rahman being suspended or banned from office or completely exhonerated . Before election day last year, residents – ‘often elderly and with little English’ – would be approached by canvassers with applications for postal votes, Mr Hoar said. ‘Supporters of Lutfur Rahman told voters that “you do not have to go and vote yourself, just give us the card and we will sort it out for you”.’ There were numerous examples of men ordering women how to vote or voting for them, it was claimed. Rahman was leader of the Tower Hamlets Labour group from 2008 to 2010, during which time ‘his career of corruption, his career of intimidation, his career of fraud began’, Mr Hoar said. In a referendum in 2010 on whether the borough should have an elected mayor, Town Hall staff said ‘half the signatures appeared to have been forged,’ the court heard. Labour dropped Rahman as its mayoral candidate after deciding he was a stooge for the Islamic Forum for Europe, a ‘secret society’ which wants to create a sharia state. Rahman stood as an independent and won the 2010 mayoral election. He sacked the council’s chief executive and assumed his powers. The court heard he personally made ‘all the decisions’ and demanded to see lists of organisations shortlisted for council grants, vetoing many. In his first four years as mayor, he and his acolytes allegedly over-ruled council officers’ recommendations in 81 per cent of grant applications – and awarded £637,000 to 30 organisations that did not even meet the minimum standards for consideration. At his re-election in May 2014, Rahman’s supporters were an intimidating presence at polling stations and did not ‘give a damn about the law… as long as their man got elected’, Mr Hoar said. Forensics expert Robert Radley, who examined ballot papers, concluded in some areas that half of the ‘X’ marks were forgeries. Bangladeshi-born law graduate Rahman’s reign as mayor has been hit by a string of scandals. He sparked a storm of protest last July by raising the Palestinian flag over the town hall ‘in solidarity’ with Gaza, and has been criticised for his £42,000-a-year taxpayer-funded chauffeur. Rahman and the council deny any wrongdoing. Duncan Penny QC, for Rahman, told the court: ‘There is little if any evidence of personal wrongdoing by Lutfur Rahman.’ He described the claims as ‘invention’, ‘exaggeration’ and ‘in some cases downright deliberately false allegations’. The case is expected to last seven weeks. The four residents who took ‘corrupt’ Lutfur Rahman to court – after police decided not to – must bear the costs of the trial. Petitioners Andrew Erlam, Debbie Simone, Azmal Hussein and Angela Moffat did not want to discuss their costs, but suggested they could potentially run into six figures. The residents – who applied to bring the court case under the Representation of the People Act 1983 – have enlisted an experienced barrister, which typically costs up to £2,000 a day, plus junior counsel on a cheaper rate. The trial is expected to last seven weeks, and the lawyers will have done several weeks of preparatory work. The case is being heard by Electoral Commissioner Richard Mawrey QC, who took the rare step of moving the hearing from Tower Hamlets town hall to the High Court, saying the town hall could not be regarded as a ‘neutral venue’. Mr Erlam, who stood as a council candidate on an anti-corruption ticket, said they were ‘just ordinary voters’ fed up with fraud and intimidation in their borough. The petitioners are asking the judge to find Rahman, and his campaign manager Alibor Choudhary, ‘guilty of corruption and illegal practices’. The judge said that if he finds in their favour, he would declare the election void, ‘as if it had never happened’. The judge would also have to power to bar the men from public office for up to five years or even, in certain circumstances, for life. The campaigners hope that in the event of a guilty verdict in this civil case, criminal charges could be considered by another court. The Met Police said it had received 131 complaints of electoral malpractice in relation to Tower Hamlets. A spokesman said: ‘Following a thorough assessment of all complaints, it has been determined that in the majority of cases there is no evidence that any criminal offences have been committed.’ He said charges had been brought against two men – neither of them Rahman – and their cases had been listed for trial later this year. Opponents: The trial will hear from Lutfur Rahman's deputy Oliur Rahman, left and Labour mayoral candidate John Biggs, right . Seat of power: Mayor Rahman has started his second term in charge of Tower Hamlets Council in east London, which has a £1billion budget . Lutfur Rahman's reign as mayor of Tower Hamlets has been hit by a string of scandals. He sparked a storm of protest last July after raising the Palestinian flag over the town hall 'in solidarity with Gaza, right. Barely 24 hours after it emerged Mr Rahman was to face trial over claims he committed widespread voting fraud, which started today, he ordered the flag to fly 'in support of a ceasefire and peace'. Jewish leaders condemned the move as 'destructive' for community relations as local residents said the council should concentrate on 'potholes and bins' and not international conflicts. Mr Rahman is a Bangladeshi-born law graduate who controls an all-Asian cabinet at the top of the council, which has a £1billion budget. He was dropped by the Labour Party after claims that he was linked to the extremist Islamic Forum of Europe - which wants to create a sharia state – but first swept to power as mayor of one of London's poorest boroughs in 2010. He won again last year. Last year Mr Rahman - who has been criticised for his £42,000-a-year taxpayer-funded chauffeur - faced allegations, broadcast in a Panorama documentary, of diverting funds to interest groups in exchange for political support. Police said that they had found no evidence of criminality. Last Autumn emergency inspections were carried out at private Islamic schools and a flagship Church of England state school in his area amid fears of a new 'Trojan horse' plot. At least six schools were examined after concerns about Islamic influences in curriculums were raised by the Department for Education, according to government sources. They included Al-Mizan primary and the London East Academy, private schools for Muslim boys run by the East London Mosque Trust. The schools teach their pupils, who are predominantly from families of Bangladeshi origin, to memorise the Koran and charge fees of £3,000 a year. Both were rated as providing a 'good' quality of education and teaching during their last inspections in 2011 and 'outstanding' for students' spiritual, moral, social and cultural development. Tower Hamlets said the inspection has not found any 'Trojan Horse-type issues relating to the conduct of staff or governors at Sir John Cass.

Grade 2-listed, the house was originally built for the Gurney banking family in 1770, which later merged with Barclays. It doesn’t look like much from the outside, but once you walk through the red front door - reached via a passageway that leads to a nursery school - you’ll feel pleasingly disarmed. William Cheeseman greets us in a low-key sort of way and shows us up the wonderful staircase. Quietly appealing: 38 St Giles St is not especially flashy, but guests will certainly feel at home . We are meant to be heading for the top floor, but never make it. ‘I thought we’d pop you in here instead,’ says William. What he means is that he’s giving us the suite, which is really a small apartment, with wood floors, painted panelled walls, huge low-lying bed and a piece of chocolate cake waiting by the kettle. Everything about the room is generous - the towels, the high ceilings, the fragrant lilies, the kilim rugs, the bottles of complimentary water. There’s no shower, unfortunately, and the shiny curtains are a touch Nineties. We also don’t understand the need for a modern chandelier in a room of this pedigree. We ask William if he can recommend a Chinese restaurant. Not only does he suggest a place called Fusion, but puts a word in for the aubergine with shredded pork - and then produces a map so we can find the restaurant. Off we set, past Norwich’s famous market and through the pedestrian precinct. We find the restaurant. No one seems to be around, and only one other table is occupied - but the friendly staff make up for any lack of atmosphere. The next day, we will visit Norwich Cathedral, surely one of the greatest religious buildings in the world, where choral services are still held twice a day. But first, a good sleep and a fine breakfast. Our suite faces the road - but it’s gloriously quiet on a Sunday evening and we sleep like purring pilgrims. Breakfast is served in a room off the hall. William is ready in his pinny. He has squeezed some Spanish oranges and poured the juice into a little jug. My soft-boiled eggs are perfect, and we like the individual pots of butter.

"The fate of the Jordanian pilot held by Islamic State terrorists remains unclear after the jihadis brutally murdered a Japanese journalist over the weekend. Government spokesman Mohammed al-Momeni said the kingdom is doing 'everything it can' to secure the release of Maaz al-Kassasbeh, who was captured by ISIS after his F-16 fighter jet crashed in territory controlled by the militants in Syria in December. ISIS has been demanding the release of a convicted female Iraqi jihadi on death row in Jordan in exchange for Kassasbeh's life - a demand the government has expressed readiness to accept provided it is given proof that the pilot still alive. The news comes just two days after ISIS' British executioner in chief, Jihadi John, savagely murdered Japanese journalist Kenji Goto in a shocking filmed beheading after days of intensive negotiations through intermediaries to save him. Scroll down for video . Hope: Jordan has vowed to do 'everything it can' to save the life of ISIS-held pilot Maaz al-Kassasbeh.

There was no mention of  Mr Kaseasbeh in Kenji Goto's murder video. The Jordanian government has said they will only release death row prisoner Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi if they get proof he is still alive . No news: Members of ISIS hostage Mu'adh al-Kaseasbeh's tribe held a candlelight vigil in his home town in Jordan as the government is under further pressure to take actions to help release him . Jordanian government spokesman Momeni today said: 'All state organisations have been mobilised to secure the proof of life that we require so that he can be freed and returned to his home.' 'We are still ready to hand over the convict Sajida al-Rishawi in return for the return of our son and our hero,' Mohammad al-Momani added. He condemned the jihadists' murder of Japanese journalist 47-yer-old Goto after days of intensive efforts through intermediaries to save him, adding: 'We spared no effort, in coordination with the Japanese government, to save his life.' Goto was the second Japanese hostage in a week to be executed by the jihadists in what they have said is punishment for Tokyo's pledge of £130 million in aid to countries affected by ISIS' bloody seizure of swathes of Iraq and Syria last year. Last week, ISIS claimed responsibility for the beheading of Haruna Yukawa after the expiry of a 72-hour ultimatum. The jihadist IS wants freed - Sajida al-Rishawi - was sentenced to death for her role in the 2005 bombings of three Amman hotels by Al-Qaeda in Iraq which killed 60 people. Her husband was one of the three suicide bombers and the court found that she had would have been a fourth but for the failure of her detonator.

ISIS threatened to kill Kaseasbeh (centre) if a deadline was not met for the release of would be Rishawi . Yesterday Kassasbeh's worried relatives pleaded with Jordan's government to be more open about negotiations for his release following Goto's murder. The fates of the pilot and the Japanese journalist had previously had been linked. The video of the beheading made no mention of the pilot, raising fears for his life. 'We want the government to tell us the truth,' said Yassin Rawashda, an uncle of the pilot. He said the family is not demanding a full briefing, but wants to hear if release efforts are headed 'in a positive direction or not.' The pilot's father, Safi al-Kaseasbeh, said he is worried, but still is putting his faith in the government. 'Of course, I'm concerned,' he said by telephone. 'This is my son. I'm always concerned about him and any development makes me more concerned.' Jordan is reportedly conducting indirect, behind-the-scenes negotiations through tribal leaders in neighboring Iraq. Over the weekend ISIS' British executioner in chief, Jihadi John, savagely murdered Japanese journalist Kenji Goto in a shocking filmed beheading after days of intensive negotiations through intermediaries to save him . The footage, which was released by the media arm of Islamic State, was entitled 'A message to the government of Japan', and in the footage Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was blamed for the killing . Last week Jordan vowed to fast-track the execution of Sajida al-Rishawi if ISIS kills Kaseasbeh. It apparently warned ISIS that she and other jailed ISIS commanders would be 'quickly judged and sentenced' in revenge for the execution of the pilot. Intelligence sources said ISIS's refusal to prove that Kaseasbeh was alive meant any deal with the militants was doomed. Jordan subsequently stepped up its rhetoric by warning  of its intent to retaliate if the negotiations end in bloodshed. Elijah Magnier, chief international correspondent for Kuwait's Al Rai newspaper, told MailOnline: 'I have reliable contact in the Jordanian government who says a message has been passed to ISIS. 'It warns that if they kill the pilot they will implement the death sentences for Sajida and other ISIS prisoners as soon as possible. Yesterday the mother and brother of  Goto spoke of their loss following confirmation that he had passed away, although the authenticity of the video has yet to be proven. 'Kenji has died, and my heart is broken. Facing such a tragic death, I'm just speechless,' Goto's mother Junko Ishido told reporters, adding that her son's death showed he was a kind gentle man, trying to save another hostage. 'I was hoping Kenji might be able to come home,' said Goto's brother, Junichi Goto, in a separate interview. 'I was hoping he would return and thank everyone for his rescue, but that's impossible, and I'm bitterly disappointed.' A video released by ISIS appears to show the 47-year-old freelance journalist being beheaded by the militant fighter known as Jihadi John. Kenji Goto, a war correspondent with experience of reporting from Middle East conflict zones, went missing in October last year as he went to help fellow Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa . Mr Goto was last heard from a week ago, when an audio clip emerged claiming to be by him, saying Mr Yukawa had been killed and asking for failed suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi to be released . Mr Goto joins a list of other victims of Jihadi John, including fellow Japanese national Haruna Yukawa (left). British aid workers David Haines (centre), and Alan Henning (right) have also been murdered . US journalist James Foley (left) was the first to appear alongside Jihadi John in one of the sickening videos, followed by Steven Sotloff (centre). American aid worker Peter Kassig (right) was also murdered by ISIS . The 70-second clip shows Mr Goto kneeling in a rocky gorge while the masked murderer delivers a scripted message to the camera. The killer then lowers his knife and the footage fades to black, as is common in ISIS propaganda films. When the footage begins again Mr Goto's body is shown lying on the desert floor. ISIS' executioner in chief, who has a British accent, says: 'To the Japanese government: You, like your foolish allies in the Satanic coalition, have yet to understand that we, by Allah's grace, are an Islamic Caliphate with authority and power, an entire army thirsty for your blood. '(Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe, because of your reckless decision to take part in an unwinnable war, this knife will not only slaughter Kenji, but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found.

"Living in the city can be cramped, with large numbers of urban dwellers living cheek by jowl in shoebox apartments. Now it seems that urban animals like rabbits also suffer from similar pitfalls of a city lifestyle. While rabbit populations in rural areas have been declining due to hunting and habitat loss, their numbers have apparently remained strong in the urban areas they inhabit. However, these city rabbits live in far smaller and simpler warrens than their rural counterparts - the bunny equivalent of studio apartments. Rabbits living in city parks, like these in Paris, adopt different lifestyles compared to their country relatives . Biologists have found that living in cities may be changing the brains of animals there. White-footed mice and meadow voles living in cities have brains that are on average six per cent larger than those of the same species found in the countryside. Scientists at the University of Minnesota who have been studying the phenomenon believe the animals are showing 'complex cognitive responses to both urban and rural areas'. The animals did not show changes in body size, which suggests the larger brains is not simply a developmental response to better nutrition and access to food afforded by living alongside humans. Instead they believe the complexities of the ever changing city environment may be driving the species that live there to become more adaptable. As a result, animals that are more flexible survive in this environment and pass on their genes, something that may be causing their brains to increase in size. Biologists also found the city rabbits also tended to live in smaller family groups. So, just like for their human neighbours, living in a city is a much more lonely way of life than in the countryside. The research was conducted by Dr Martin Plath and his student Madlen Ziege at Frankfurt University. Miss Ziege said: 'Burrow densities increased along the rural-to-urban gradient, accompanied by a gradual shift from accumulated towards more evenly distributed burrows. 'Burrows became smaller and less complex with increasing degree of urbanity, and accordingly, also the number of rabbits inhabiting the same burrow decreased.' In the study, which is published in the Journal of Zoology, examined rabbit populations in Frankfurt and the surrounding area. They looked at 191 burrows in nine city parks, four suburban parks and three nearby rural sites. By staking our burrows at night, using tagging and flushing out the inhabitants with trained ferrets, the researchers were able to build up a picture of how the rabbits in each area were living along with how many entrances there were to each warren. They found that rabbits in more urban areas tended to live in simpler warrens with fewer entrances. There were also fewer rabbits in each warren. However, the burrows were packed more tightly together. The city rabbits had fewer entrances to their warrens than their rural relatives and had smaller burrows . European rabbits, like this one, have been declining across Europe due to disease, hunting and loss of habitat . The reason for this, say the researchers, could be because food supplies in cities are far more reliable than in the countryside. Rabbit tend to form larger groups when food is in short supply. It could also be because cities tend to be a couple of degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside, meaning the rabbits no longer need to live together in one warren to keep each other warm. There may also be fewer predators in cities, meaning the rabbits need fewer escape routes from their homes. This may be among the underlying reasons for rabbits moving to cities in the first place. In their native Spain populations of European rabbits have declined by 20 per cent since 1975 while in Portugal they have fallen by 24 per cent. Rabbits have been living in parks in Frankfurt, above, since the 1930s and have adapted to the packed city life . In the UK there were thought to be up to 100 million rabbits living around the country but disease and habitat change has seen those numbers fall. A Government survey in 1995 estimated that there were 37.5 million rabbits left, but new diseases such as rabbit haemorrhagic disease may have reduced their numbers further. A recent study estimated that rabbit numbers had fallen by 48 per cent since 1993. Miss Ziege said that the carefully maintained mosaic-like habitats that spring up around cities may provide a more stable environment for rabbits than in agricultural areas. Speaking to New Scientist, Miss Ziege added: 'Cities are providing a constant and high food supply through human waste and deliberate feeding, as well as access to vegetation cover, such as shrubs. 'Many areas in modern cities are often structurally highly diverse and the urban rabbit population could be benefiting from this.'","Biologists at Frankfurt University found rabbits are adapting to city life .
Their homes are becoming simpler and smaller than those in the country .
While warrens are built closer together, the animals live in smaller groups .

"A Super Bowl ad has a small but vocal group incensed in the wake of Sunday night's game, but they aren't who you'd expect. An NBC-sponsored spot starring Parks & Rec manly man Nick Offerman has angered celiac disease sufferers for its suggestion they should toughen up and watch some NASCAR. 'When our idea of danger is eating gluten, there’s trouble afoot,' says Offerman in the ad, which by Monday morning had already spurred some 18,000 people to sign a petition to remove the reference. Scroll down for video... Controversial: Celiac sufferers are petitioning to get NBC to nix an ad for NASCAR that features Parks & Rec actor Nick Offerman because it 'makes fun of those who are gluten-free' Posted by user 'Gluten Dude,' the petition says the ad 'makes fun of those who are gluten-free. It implies that we're soft.' Offerman's monologue indeed references gluten once in a series of examples of how America has 'gotten soft.' The ad's solution isn't avoiding gluten, as 3 million celiac sufferers must do every day throughout their lives, it is to 'get some NASCAR in your life.' Gluten Dude takes issue with the suggestion, 'We're weak...we're part of America's problem.' 'I think about all of the gluten-free children getting bullied for being ""different"", when all they want to do is feel better and fit in. 'When our idea of danger is eating gluten, there’s trouble afoot,' says Offerman in the ad, which by Monday morning had already spurred some 18,000 people to sign a petition to remove the reference . 'I think about all of the people who have gotten sick at restaurants because the kitchen and/or the staff do not take us seriously,' he writes. Gluten Dude wrote after seeing the ad prior to the Super Bowl that his plea, which also appears at GlutenDude.com, had been heard by NBC. 'NBC has announced they will remove the gluten reference,' he wrote Saturday. However, the ad--complete with the gluten joke--indeed went on to come through on the televisions of 100 million people Sunday. So NBC lied,' Gluten Dude wrote. 'They are not running the gluten reference ad ONLY online. Why am I not surprised?!' Known only as Gluten Dude, the man behind the petition has a history of demanding attention be paid to the issue of celiac disease . Gluten is found primarily in wheat, but also in rye, barley, and to a lesser extent, oats. It makes up the protein part of these grains, and is the substance that makes bread dough elastic. But in a small proportion of people, gluten can't be properly digested, with the result that the surface of the intestine becomes damaged and inflamed. The effect is poor absorption of various nutrients, such as essential fats, vitamins and minerals (including calcium and iron). Celiac is an autoimmine disease and undiagnosed sufferers who continue to consume gluten are at a higher risk for certain cancers and other autoimmune disorders. No two individuals react exactly the same way to gluten intolerance. However, the commonest symptoms are diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, gas and a flaky skin rash. Untreated, celiac disease can lead to nutrient deficiencies problems, including iron deficiency anemia, chronic fatigue, weight loss and osteoporosis. Source .

'For the campaign, we honed in on the essence of strong women who haven’t conformed.' He added: 'Tavi is so strong and so bright. Iris is kind of like a mother to me at this point and was probably a little bit annoyed that I never asked her to be in an ad [before].'","Mrs Apfel also features alongside blogger turned Broadway star Tavi Gevinson, 18, in jewelry brand Alexis Bittar's Spring 2015 ad ."
"This is the moment a brave Indian woman confronted a fellow passenger who she claims molested her during a flight from Mumbai. The woman lambasted the man on camera in front of the entire flight after he allegedly touched her inappropriately through the seat gap on the Indigo flight in January. The alleged victim later filmed a second clip at Bhubaneshwar airport, in which she shames the man into making an apology. Scroll down for videos . A brave Indian woman filmed the moment she confronted a fellow passenger (left and right), who she claims molested her during a flight from Mumbai to Bhubaneshwar . In the footage, the furious woman zooms in on the man (pictured) as he tries to shield his face from the camera . As he looks in the camera, a man who appears to be the same person says: 'I made a mistake'. According to a message posted alongside the footage, the incident unfolded after the man allegedly touched the anonymous passenger during the flight. Although the woman did not react the first time, she decided to confront the man on camera after he allegedly prepared to touch her for the second time, according to the post. In the video, the furious woman zooms in on the man as he tries to shield his face from the camera. She then shouts: 'You are asking for forgiveness? Why? Because I'm a girl and you have the right to touch me anytime, anywhere you want to?' She then adds: 'What forgiveness are you asking for? Did you do it only once? Was it by mistake? 'I will call the security. I will make a complaint. You thought you could do it again right?' In the second video, the man is filmed in what appears to be the airport, as he is quizzed by the alleged victim and another man. In the video, he says: 'I'm prepared to face any consequence for it.' He then adds: 'I made a mistake. I made a mistake. I made a mistake, madam, I made a mistake. Everybody makes mistakes in life. I made a mistake. It's a big mistake.' He also pleads with the woman to stop filming, saying: 'I've got the punishment already. I've got the punishment already... I already faced the humiliation.'

In the video, he says: 'I'm prepared to face any consequence for it,' before adding: 'I made a mistake. I made a mistake, madam' But the girl continues to ask the alleged harasser questions, before saying: 'You decided the action; I will decide the reaction.' The woman also suggests that the man has offered to give her a written apology over the alleged incident. He then says: 'For touching you, I want to give you a written— I request you.' The clip was posted by Shreyas Rao, who says the video had been forwarded to him by the 'brave girl' who allegedly suffered the attack. He captions the clip with a statement from the girl, which says: 'This man on the seat behind mine, put his fingers in the seat gap to touch me! 'I was very shocked for sometime to react. By then the flight went to landing mode. Then the moment flight touched down, I got up. Saw his hand was again on the side ready to take up any opportunity to touch me!!! 'I created such a scene, humiliated him in front of the whole flight! He thought like usual girls will keep quiet and he can get away with this! I have lodged an FIR now!' The statement goes on: 'He is a very rich man of Bhubaneswar and is now very humiliated in front of the people who know him. 'Cant believe the ordeal i had to go thru but being silent is a crime! The police officer was very helpful and the Indigo staff remained with me throughout. The man is under police custody currently. 'I clicked his pictures and made videos, shouted so loud that the entire plane came forward to see him! i made sure i humiliate him as much as possible because i know law will do nothing' The alleged incident took board an Indigo flight from Mumbai to Bhubaneshwar.

"A breakthrough in fertility science could lead to a huge boost in the success of IVF, scientists said today. IVF - or ‘in vitro fertilisation’ - is currently the only hope for many women to have a baby, and some 50,000 undergo the treatment every year in Britain. But despite its popularity, the procedure has a poor success rate, with 75 per cent of IVF rounds failing to produce a baby. Scroll down for video . Despite its popularity, IVF (pictured) has a poor success rate, with 75 per cent of rounds failing to work . Manchester University researchers now think they have found a way to slash the failure rate by half. They have discovered a ‘molecular switch’ which stops an embryo being accepted in the mother’s womb. If that switch can be blocked with drugs, it could potentially boost the number of babies born using IVF by up to 18,000 a year. About 37 per cent of IVF rounds are thought to fail because the embryo does not implant into the wall of the uterus. Women who repeatedly suffer this failure have been shown to have high levels of a molecular switch which interferes in the communication between the embryo and the mother’s womb. In laboratory tests, the researchers found that if they reduced levels of the molecule - called microRNA-145 - the embryo was less likely to be rejected. Study leader Professor John Aplin, whose work is published in the Journal of Cell Science, said: ‘When an embryo is ready for implantation, its replacement is carefully timed to coincide with the window of maximal receptivity in the uterus. ‘This window is open for no more than four days.’ Professor Aplin’s team found that a protein called IGF1R is required during the four-day window for the embryo to stick to the uterus. Their tests suggest that the microRNA-145 molecular switch stops the crucial protein from growing in that window. Scientists have discovered a ‘molecular switch’ which stops an embryo being accepted in the mother’s womb. If that switch can be blocked with drugs, it could potentially boost the number of babies born using IVF by up to 18,000 a year . Dr Karen Forbes, a reproductive scientists who worked on the project, said the breakthrough could change the lives of childless women - although the team is a long way from turning it into a successful treatment. Crucially, there are already chemicals on the market which have been shown to block microRNAs, and those could be developed to stop this molecular switch from interfering in the IVF process. ‘There are lots of ways in which we can inhibit microRNAs in the lab,’ she said. ‘Eventually drugs might be developed that could improve implantation rates.’ Professor Aplin added: ‘This is one of the hardest groups of women to treat in fertility science and rates are still very low across the board. ‘Repeated IVF cycles are stressful and can be expensive too. ‘Greater understanding of the mechanisms which control success or failure can lead directly to treatments to make IVF cycles more efficient so that infertile couples can start their families.’","IVF has a poor success rate, with 75% of rounds failing to produce a baby .

"Apple is to plans Monday to pump $2 billion over the coming decade into a data center 'global command' facility in Arizona. The project represents one of the largest investments ever by the maker of the iPhone, iPod, iPad and Macintosh computer. 'We're proud to continue investing in the US with a new data center in Arizona, which will serve as a command center for our global networks,' Apple said. Apple unveils plans to pump $2 billion over the coming decade into a data center 'global command' facility in Arizona ©Philippe Huguen (AFP/File) 'Like all Apple data centers, it will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy, much of which will come from a new local solar farm.' The facility with some 120,000 square meters (1.3 million square feet) had been the planned site of a plant to produce sapphire glass screens in a collaboration with GT Advance Technologies. The collaboration came apart late last year after GTAT filed for bankruptcy and accused Apple of saddling the company with onerous terms in the deal. State officials said the investment is a good deal for Arizona. 'Apple is a company that we wanted to come to Arizona, previously with a third party,' state Governor Doug Ducey said during a press conference. 'Now, we have Apple itself investing in our state. 'This is a one-of-a-kind company, they just had a world record quarterly earnings, and they are coming to Arizona.' Ducey said Apple has made a 30-year commitment with the data center, and that it will sign on about 150 employees along with creating hundreds of construction jobs during the building phases. Greenpeace senior IT sector analyst Gary Cook lauded Apple's decision to build an Arizona data center powered by renewable energy. 'Apple remains the most aggressive among major IT companies in delivering on its commitments to be 100 percent renewable, and has shown the business community that solar is ready, here and now, to power our economy,' Cook said. He calls on other technology industry titans, particularly Amazon and its massive cloud services operation, to follow suit. The announcement comes four months after an earlier Apple plan for the 1.3 million-square-foot facility it bought in 2013 failed. The tech giant had a deal with Merrimack, New Hampshire-based GT Advanced to use the plant to make sapphire glass for its products, but the company declared bankruptcy in October after production issues developed. GT openly accused Apple of using a 'classic bait-and-switch strategy' with a deal that he called 'massively one-sided.' Apple lawyers accused GT of making false statements about the deal, among other allegations. After the GT failure, Apple said it would work to find another use for the plant. It also has been working to help more than 600 GT employees who lost their jobs. An Apple spokesman said construction on the new data center should start late next year, if not earlier. GT is storing advanced furnaces it planned to use in its Apple venture at the plant while the furnaces are being liquidated, delaying the immediate use of the plant. Apple also has committed to building and financing 70 megawatts of new solar power generation, enough to power more than 14,500 homes. Apple's data centers provide the computer muscle for the company's iCloud, ITunes, Siri and other products.","One of the largest investments ever by the maker of the iPhone .

Wrapped up: The Queen in a sand-coloured Karl Ludwig wool and angora coat with thick fur trimmed cuffs . Her Majesty looked cheerful as she arrived at a fire station in King's Lynn with the Duke of Edinburgh . In a nod to the freezing weather currently gripping the country, she wore a snowflake brooch - a late-Victorian diamond star design which she was left by Lady Jardine in 1981. The Queen was today joined by the Duke of Edinburgh as proud firefighters and their families showed off their new station at its official opening. Crowds were waiting for the royal couple outside the new station, on Horsley's Fields, King's Lynn, in the biting cold. Well-wishers and children from nearby St Michael's Primary School waved flags and cheered as the Queen and Duke arrived. The Queen wore one of her favourite diamond brooches which was given to her as a gift in 1981 . She paired her coat with a colour coordinating hat by the late Philip Somerville . What a difference a day makes: The Queen looked chilly at a church service yesterday . The royal couple were met by the Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk Richard Jewson and Norfolk's chief fire officer Nigel Williams, who showed them around the new station. The facility will speed up response times to emergencies to the south and west of Lynn, because appliances will not have to battle their way through town centre traffic.

The Duke of Edinburgh chats to the volunteers about their work alongside firefighters and members of the Hunstanton fire cadets . Firefighter Mark Endersby, who has been in the service 15 years, talked them through their role. 'The Duke was very interested in it, he was asking what does this do, what does that do,' he said. Both craft were deployed during the 2003 storm surge, when flood waters threatened King's Lynn and its surrounding coast and waterways. The Queen and Duke were shown Randy an artificial horse used to train crews in animal or so-called 'technical' rescues - a common emergency in the Fens. The Royal couple met young people from the Prince's Trust, who work alongside firefighters and members of the Hunstanton fire cadets. Cadet Scott Jarman, 17, from Lynn, said: 'It was a special moment.' The Queen is shown a model horse used by the firefighters for animal rescue training . She signed a picture of herself as she officially opened the new station . The Queen's Jardine Star brooch . The Queen wore one of her favourite brooches today, an eight point star known as the Jardine Star. Such is its place in her heart, she has worn it on numerous special occasions including at her Diamond Jubilee river pageant in 2012. The brooch contains 41 large and 24 smaller diamonds, weighing a total of approximately 40 carat, according to the royalforums.com. Little is know about its origin, other than that it was gifted to the Queen in 1981 by Lady Jardine, a Scottish aristocrat. He added: 'The Duke asked do we start fires and put them out? I said no, we don't. 'The Queen asked me if I'd like to join the fire service and I said: Absolutely.' The Queen and Duke met firefighters from the station, before unveiling a plaque to marks its official opening. Mr Williams said both the plaque, and portraits of themselves which the couple signed, would have pride of place at the station. As the couple left, the Queen was presented with a posy by Mia Donley, nine, from Shouldham, Her father, crew manager Dale Cammidge, has recently returned to fighting fires after taking a year off to fight throat cancer. 'She said are those for me? Thank you very much,' said Mia, who admitted to a few nerves beforehand. Mia's mother Lisa, who was watching with her elder daughter Courtney, 13, said: 'I had tears in my eyes. It was such a one-off moment.' The Queen and Duke spent half an hour at the station. Afterwards station commander Bob Ayers said: 'I thought it went very well. The Queen and Duke were on fine form, asking some challenging questions of the crews. 'The Queen showed a lot of interest in the water rescue side of things. Overall, it's good for the station, it marks the official start for the station.' West Norfolk mayor Barry Ayres said: 'It's really put the stamp on this, which is such an important building for the town.' Sue Neal, from North Lynn, waited outside with her husband John while their son John Charles, a a retained firefighter, lined up with his crewmates. 'It's a day I'll never forget,' she said.

"Three BBC workers have been quizzed by Swiss police after flying a drone into a no-fly zone over the World Economic Forum in Davos. The corporation could be fined for the security breach at the conference, during which the Duke of York addressed allegations that he had sex with an under-age teenager. Security was heightened at the luxury resort in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks in Paris, with a no-fly area implemented over parts of the site. Three BBC workers have been quizzed by Swiss police after flying a drone (file picture) into a no-fly zone over the World Economic Forum in Davos . The BBC could be fined for flying the drone over the World Economic Forum, where a no-fly zone had been imposed . The BBC confirmed a team had been detained by police in Davos for breaking the strict rules. A statement said: 'We can confirm that in Davos during the World Economic Forum a BBC team mistakenly took a drone into a no-fly zone area. 'Three members of staff were briefly questioned by police and it is still to be determined by the Swiss authorities if the BBC will pay a fine.' Prince Andrew addressed allegations that he had sex with an under-age teenager at the conference . The conference had taken on added interest following accusations by Virginia Roberts, a mother-of-three now in her 30s, that Prince Andrew had under-age sex with the woman years earlier. Andrew, who had faced mounting pressure to speak personally about the allegations, started his forum speech by denying the claims, but made no further mention of them as he went on to talk about his work promoting entrepreneurs. In the UK, drones must not be flown within 150 metres of a congested area or large group of people, such as a sporting event or concert. They also have to be flown at least 50 metres away from any person or building. Anyone breaking those rules can be fined up to £5,000. As the popularity of drones has increased, near missed with planes have become more frequent. An Airbus A320 had a near miss with one of the crafts as it landed at Heathrow in July. The 180-seater aircraft was at just 700ft when the pilot saw the drone, which had not shown up on air traffic control radar. A European Championship qualifier between Albania and Serbia had to be called off last year after a drone carrying a political message was flown into the stadium. The interruption caused a mass brawl as a Serbia player pulled it from the sky, enraging the Albanians.

"The Super Bowl scored its highest-ever overnight ratings for New England's thrilling win over Seattle, an early indication the game may be on the way to another viewership record. The Nielsen company said Monday the game had a 49.7 rating in the nation's largest media markets, up four percent over last year's game. That means 49.7 percent of the homes in those 56 markets were watching the game. Scroll down for video . Record-breaking: The Super Bowl scored its highest-ever overnight ratings for New England's thrilling win over Seattle. Quaterback Tom Brady is pictured with franchise owner Robert Kraft . The nation as a whole has 116 million homes with television. Nielsen had no immediate estimate of the number of viewers. Last year's contest between Seattle and Denver was seen by 111.5 million, the annual game setting a record for the most-watched TV event in U.S. history for the fourth time in five years. The game had a 72 share, meaning 72 percent of televisions on Sunday night were tuned to NBC's broadcast of the game in which the Patriots scored a 28-24 victory over the Seahawks. Broadcasts of the game make up the top 21 most viewed programs in US history. In 1967, when the first Super Bowl was held, around 50 million tuned into the game. This fell towards 40 million in its second year. However the number of viewers has massively increased and sets constantly high ratings records. In comparison the final episode of M*A*S*H attracted a 60 per cent share of viewers while an audience of 53 million tuned in for a 1996 episode of Friends.

"Chelsea’s players have been warned they will receive a verbal lashing from Derby County captain Richard Keogh if any of them try diving to win a penalty. Keogh witnessed the Chelsea performance branded ‘Swan Lake’ by Hull manager Steve Bruce and is not afraid to deliver personal rebukes to offenders. Head coach Steve McClaren also added his voice to the debate, calling for the FA to take retrospective action on simulation. It is a crime, he believes, on par with red-card tackles because ‘it can cost you the game’. Richard Keogh will given a stern talking to any Chelsea players who try to dive to win a penalty . Keogh was unfortunate to suffer play-off heartbreak with Derby last season after an outstanding season . Chelsea centre back Gary Cahill (centre) was not booked for this dive against Hull on Saturday . Kick-off: 7.45pm iPro Stadium. TV: LIVE Sky Sports 1 from 7.30pm. Referee: Jonathan Moss . Chelsea travel to the iPro Stadium for Tuesday’s Capital One Cup quarter-final on the back of stinging criticism from Bruce, who was infuriated when Gary Cahill escaped a second yellow card for a tumble in the box. The match at Stamford Bridge saw Diego Costa and Willian booked for diving by referee Chris Foy and it is an issue Derby are familiar with as far as Chelsea are concerned. The two teams met in January for an FA Cup third round tie and Ramires received a yellow card for simulation from Andre Marriner. Earlier this season when Callum McManaman went down in the area, Keogh stood over the Wigan winger to administer a firm censure. Expect the Derby defender to do the same to Chelsea’s stellar collection of talents. ‘I stick up for my team-mates, I stick up for the club,’ said Keogh. ‘McManaman went over quite easy in the box and I let him know it wasn’t acceptable. As a player it is quite frustrating. ‘Players are going to do it unless their manager stamps it out. It will be a touchy subject for as long as it carries on. You don’t want fellow professionals to cheat. 'I don’t know if cheat is the right word, it is one of those things that happens in football that we want to see less of. Steve McLaren wants diving incidents which go unnoticed to be investigated by authorities afterwards . Jose Mourinho has led Chelsea to the top of the Premier League after a excellent opening half to the season . ‘The referee is the key to it. He has to be strong. It is such a tough decision because the pace of the game means things happen so quickly. Players can’t argue if they have blatantly dived and get booked — it is not right.’ McClaren wants diving incidents that go undetected to be studied by authorities afterwards. ‘If people cheat and do wrong, they have to suffer the consequences, we’ve all had to do that,’ he said. ‘(Video analysis) should be (used), they do it in other things so why not for diving or simulation? ‘It keeps getting mentioned for years now and still nothing’s been done. It’s in our game and it needs to be stamped out. We try to do it as managers and coaches, but it’s up to referees and the authorities to take the action we can’t take.’ McClaren coaches his defenders about the perils of going to ground in the box. ‘It’s what we call the red zone. It’s danger! Don’t give the opponent the opportunity to fall over or catch your foot.’ Ultimately McClaren hopes the match will be decided without controversy. He believes Chelsea have improved hugely since the sides met nearly a year ago. Following that crushing play-off final defeat at Wembley, Derby have topped the Championship at stages this season but sit third after losing to Middlesbrough on Saturday. A League Cup run is a positive, but promotion to the Premier League is the big prize. McLaren and Mourinho share a joke on the touchline at the iPro Stadium during last year's FA Cup clash . Keogh added: ‘It is going to be a good benchmark to see how far we have come since we played them in January. 'As a squad I think we have really matured. It is going to be a great test but this is why you are in football, to test yourself against the best. We are striving to play against this calibre of team every week. ‘From a year ago they have improved immensely. Mourinho’s addressed the areas he thought were a problem, up front and then (Nemanja) Matic and (Cesc) Fabregas in midfield: so strong mentally and physically. We did a video on the weaknesses on their team and it lasted about five seconds. ‘They are the best team in the Premier League and arguably the best team in Europe. ‘We have to perform at our best to stay in the game and have a chance of achieving our dream result. 'I want to see how our players perform — have we moved on from a year ago? Because Chelsea have. ‘Mourinho will respect us. That will reflect in the team he picks. We don’t expect any favours.’","Derby face Chelsea in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night .

"There was elation inside the University of Pheonix stadium for fans of the New England Patriots last night as they clinched a historic fourth Super Bowl win. But some fans were bitterly disappointed after finding out they didn't have tickets to attend the game. One fan started sobbing as he told how a broker charged him thousands of dollars for tickets but then told him they couldn't fulfil his order. The Super Bowl XLIX earned the dubious accolade of the most expensive game in the event's 49-year history, with some tickets changing hands on the day for as much as $12,000. Grief: This Seattle Seahawks fan from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, whose name was not given, sobbed as he explained how a ticket broker charged him $4,500 for three tickets - then told him it wouldn't fulfil the order . Emotion: The man openly wept beside the Pheonix University Stadium as he told his sad story . Some ticket resellers were apparently engaged in short-selling, a technique where brokers sell seats before obtaining tickets, planning to buy the tickets at a later date for less money in order to make a profit. That technique depends on tickets being available for brokers to purchase closer to the game. Chicago-based reseller Vivid Seats was forced to admit to customers before this year's game that it wouldn't be able to fufill ticket orders, despite already taking hefty deposits. One man waiting outside the stadium in Pheonix said he spent $1,500 per seat for three seat bookings with Vivid Seats, only to get a call days before the game saying 'sorry, we can't fulfil your order'. The Seattle Seahawks fan from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, whose name was not given, sobbed as he told his story to Fox News Q13. 'For two weeks I thought, for sure, I was going to be in there screaming with the 12th man [pause] and now I don't get to do that,' he said. 'It's tough. 'It's upsetting [pause] that you could just [say] ""sorry we don't have your tickets any more"".' Stadium: Streamers and bunting drift from the roof to the pitch as the New England Patriots celebrate their victory over the Seattle Seahawks at the University of Pheonix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona . Cheerleaders: Patriots cheerleaders celebrate their team's success . Support: The Seahawks' cheerleaders perform during the Super Bowl XLIX, which was watched by millions . Vivid Seats has reportedly been giving 200 per cent refunds to some customers as a result of its failure to supply tickets. But many fans were upset nonetheless. 'Our whole bubble has been popped and I'm just heartbroken,' said Sheila Kissel, a Seahawks fan from Arizona who was handed back her $4,500 deposit, plus another $4,500 on top. She told ABC News that she and her husband had planned to go to the game with her brother. However, her brother died earlier this year and Mrs Kissel had planned to take his ashes to the game instead. 'That was real special thing we were going to do. So that's hard too,' she said. Vivid Seats told ABC 15 Arizona that the seller of Mrs Kissel's tickets had told the firm they could not be delivered 'until as late as Sunday'. 'Such a delay in delivery is atypical, and therefore we recognize it could be both concerning and result in a substantial inconvenience for Ms. Kissel,' the company said in explanation for its decision to refund the money. There was also speculation that some brokers may have held on to tickets they had already sold because they knew they could get more money selling them to new customers closer to the game.","Heartbroken fan spent $4,500 booking tickets with broker Vivid Seats .

"For ten years James Robertson hasn't missed a single day of work. What's even more remarkable is that Robertson walks a round trip of 21 miles a day just to get there. For five days a week, Robertson, 56, trudges from his home in Detroit to his job at the factory where he works in Rochester Hills, Michigan. He's walked the walk ever since his 1988 Honda Accord quit on him more than 10 years ago. His job pays him $10.55 an hour, which he claims is not enough for him to buy his own car, but that may well change after well-wishers managed to raise almost $42,000 for him in an online campaign in just hours. For now though, whatever the weather, Robertson is there, on the job for his 2-10pm shift. Scroll down for video... Determined: James Robertson is a 56-year-old Detroiter who walks the majority of his 21-mile commute to work in Rochester Hills, Michigan five days a week - whatever the weather . Tenacious: Ever since his car quit on him a decade ago, James Robertson has walked 21 miles a day to get to and from work, because Detroit buses only cover part of the route - and he doesn't complain . In the city that made the motor car famous, he is without his own four-wheels and there's no decent bus service to get him to where he wants to go, either. 'I set our attendance standard by this man,' said his boss Todd Wilson to the Detroit Free Press. Wilson is plant manager at high-end plastic moulding specialists,  Schain Mold & Engineering. 'I say, if this man can get here, walking all those miles through snow and rain, well, I'll tell you, I have people in Pontiac 10 minutes away and they say they can't get here — bull! He's never missed. I've seen him come in here wringing wet,' said Wilson, 53. To watch video in full click here . Robertson claims he powers his marathon-like commutes by drinking two liters of Mountain Dew and countless cans of Coke each day. 'I sleep a lot on the weekend, yes I do,' he said, 'but I can't imagine not working,' Although the commute getting into work is grueling, things are worse on the way back as Robertson has to walk the streets alone, in the dark and freezing cold. None of his co-workers lives anywhere near him, so catching a ride almost never happens. Faith: 'I'm not saying I'm a member of some church. But just before I get home, every night, I say, 'Lord, keep me safe'', Mr Robertson says . His colleagues have been telling him for years to get a car but it appears that Robertson has fallen into a routine that he almost seems to enjoy it. 'I keep a rhythm in my head,' he says. 'I'm not saying I'm a member of some church. But just before I get home, every night, I say, 'Lord, keep me safe.' About three-quarters of the way home, he has to catch the very last bus of the night at 1am into downtown Detroit - after that it's another five mile trek back to the home he shares with his girlfriend. The walk takes him through some shady neighborhoods including Highland Park and the infamous 8 Mile area. Robertson says he was mugged once but doesn't like to talk about the incident. Four hours later he is back home to catch some shut-eye before the long-distance commute begins all over again the following afternoon. 'The last five years been really tough because the buses cut back,' Robertson said. Once he gets to Troy and Detroit, Robertson can take a bus but the schedule is so infrequent the area is really best designed for those that have access to a car. He says that it's not just the $1,700 monthly paycheck that lures him back to work each day but the very essence of being around his friendly co-workers whom he calls 'family'. The boss's wife has also taken a shine to him and prepares him home-cooked meals each evening too. Grueling: After repeated cutbacks in bus service the walking segments of his daily commute now takes more time than he spends in his eight-hour factory shift. For Robertson it's a chance to catch-up on some  sleep . On several occasions, a banker driving the exact same route has given Robertson a ride. Blake Pollock, 47, of Rochester said he saw Robertson over and over in various weathers and wondered what he was doing out all alone. Whenever he sees him along the route, he gives him a ride and very occasionally, even if it's after midnight, he will go out driving along his route to see if he can offer him a lift. 'Knowing what I know, I can't drive past him now. I'm in my car with the heat blasting and even then my feet are cold,' Pollock said. Of course, all that may now be about to change after tens of thousands of dollars were raised for him in an online campaign. Robertson said Sunday he was flattered by the attention he'd gotten for his tenacious treks after the he made front page news in a local newspaper. He said he was amazed that complete strangers would respond so generously with some even offering to buy him a brand new car. Evan Leedy, 19, of Macomb Township, a WSU student studying computer science, said he was struck by the article and the sheer numbers of people commenting online, many of them asking how they could help Robertson. Leedy said he decided to act. 'I just used my phone. I created the go-funding site and within an hour we had $2,000,' he said. A local car dealership even offered to give him a 2014 Chevrolet Cruz or Sonic. 'He gets to choose,' said Angela Osborne, customer service specialist at Rodgers Chevrolet in Woodhaven. 'We were just impressed with his determination,' Ms. Osborne said. As of Monday morning, the total was close to $42,000 and still rising.","Detroiter James Robertson, 56, walks about 21 miles a day, round trip .

"Lanes of impatient drivers and pot-hole ridden pavements can make cycling in the city seem like a battle for survival. But now, an innovative helmet that reads a rider's brain waves is hoping to change that by mapping cyclists' stress levels. Dubbed MindRider, the helmet uses the data it collects to create real-time maps of the best routes for stress-free city cycling. Zoom in on the interactive map below to find out the most relaxing cycle routes in New York . The helmet is being developed by Brooklyn-based start-up DuKorp, who have been testing it on the streets of New York. During September and October, eight riders wore the helmets while travelling Manhattan using the north-south thoroughfares. As the wearer rode down city streets, the mind reading helmet tracked their brainwaves to measure their stress levels before plotting them on a map. A riders' level of attention – which indicated stress - was ranked from 0 to 100, then linked onto a colour scale, from green to yellow to red. The 'Mindrider' helmet has a forehead-based sensor that uses EEG to measure the cyclist's brain waves. This data is then placed on to a real-time map, revealing the biker's stress levels on different city streets. Pictured are maps of Manhattan created using the system . During September and October, eight riders wore the helmets (right) while travelling Manhattan (left) using the north-south thoroughfares. The ride is shown on the map using a colour scale, with green suggesting a relaxing ride and red revealing stress . The helmet has a soft forehead-based sensor that uses EEG – or electroencephalography – to measure the rider's brain waves.It also has an ear-based sensor that's used to remove noise from the EEG signal. The current design is also Bluetooth compatible allowing the data from the EEG sensor to be fed to an app on the user's smartphone which uses the phone's GPS . After a few rides, the cyclists could analyse the data they had generated to plan the best route. A separate crowd sourced map was also created, which gathered data to help other cyclists or city planner plan the best bike routes in their area. Its creators hope, eventually, anyone with the helmet can share their data anonymously, and this information will be included in a real-time map online. Developed by a designer during a visit to MIT Media Lab, the helmet looks slightly different to an ordinary bike helmet. 'The bumps are inspired by the branching neurons and shape of the brain itself,' Arlene Ducao, who created the helmet told FastCoExist.com. 'They are stylistic, but as we move toward a final design, we may use them to help secure the circuit in place.' The new version of the helmet has a light that tells the cyclist if their anxious by glowing in area visible from the corner of their eye. Pictured is a map generated by the system which shows the 'hotspots' and 'sweet spots' in New York . A riders' level of attention – which indicated stress - was ranked from 0 to 100, then linked onto a colour scale, from green to yellow to red . The helmet has a soft forehead-based sensor that uses EEG – or electroencephalography – to measure the rider's brain waves. It also has an ear-based sensor that's used to remove noise from the EEG signal. An early prototype included red and green lights to warn drivers if a cyclist was particularly stressed. That design has now been scrapped and the new version has a light that tells the cyclist if their anxious by glowing in area visible from the corner of their eye. This can help the cyclists know when to be more cautious, and lower their stress levels by moving away from a particularly busy street. The current design is also Bluetooth compatible allowing the data from the EEG sensor to be fed to an app on the user's smartphone which uses the phone's GPS. The team is currently mapping local neighbourhoods in Brooklyn, New York, block-by-block. 'We think the map could still be useful to compare against traffic and accident data, and will be a cool visual proof-of-concept,' said Ms Ducao. The Visijax Commuter Jacket contains flashing LEDs on the sleeves which are activated when a cyclist raises their arm . From smart helmets to traffic detection systems, inventors are working to make cycling safer. Now there's a light-up jacket with built in indicators to make a biker's intentions clearer to motorists. The Visijax Commuter Jacket contains flashing LEDs on the sleeves which are activated when a cyclist raises their arm - so that other road users can clearly see when they're making a turn. The smart jacket also contains a built-in light on the back to help boost riders' visibility. It runs off a handy USB-charged battery pack and comes in two colours – black and neon yellow. The jacket will go on sale later this month at Halfords, for £99 ($150). 'Our customers told us that better safety products would encourage them to cycle more, and the illuminating Visijax Commuter Jacket will make it easier for commuters to be seen on the roads,' said Halfords product manager Ross Hubbard said. 'We know visibility can be a major barrier to cycling at this time of year - we want to help commuters to overcome these barriers and to encourage as many people as possible to cycle.'","The 'Mindrider' helmet has a forehead-based sensor that uses EEG to measure the cyclist's brain waves .

"A pair of adrenaline junkies took their love of extreme sports to a new level by being sling-shotted out of a paraglider at nearly 15,000 feet. Thrill-seeking Horacio Llorens, 32, from Spain, and Hernán Pitocco, 36, from Argentina, performed the daring stunt high above the Pyrenees mountain range in southwest Europe. They took a hot air balloon to 14,700 feet, and then the pair were filmed as they hurled themselves off the edge, before launching into a series of stunning somersaults. After building up to a massive force of 7G, they sling-shotted themselves out of a paraglider and skydived down to a ski resort below. Scroll down for video .

After building up to a massive force of 7G, they sling-shotted themselves out of a paraglider and skydived down to a ski resort below . Mr Llorens, who is a five-time Acro Paragliding World Cup Champion and a Guinness World Record holder, explained he and Mr Pitocco needed to be perfectly in sync. He said: 'To do it safely, we both needed to release from the glider together, at a very precise moment, to ensure we wouldn't fall into the glider. 'We are not so good at this type of thing as we are at paragliding so it was necessary to feel comfortable in the air to do the slingshot properly. So in order to prepare for the moment, the paragliders both spent seven hours training in a wind tunnel . He added: 'We took the hot air balloon to about 4,500 metres, and exited by letting the glider hang out of the basket, then tumbling over it.

'At 3,900 metres we did about 13 revolutions and then after 13, we released, at around 3,400 metres. 'Then it was a simple sky-dive to the landing at 2,000 metres, at the ski resort of La Molina.' Mr Llorens is a pioneer of aerobatic paragliding, which he began learning at the age of 14 as he watched his cousin's fly at his uncle’s paragliding school in the Spanish industrial aviation hub of Albacete. At 18, he entered his first competition, one of the very few synchronised aerobatic paragliding tournaments that existed in those days, as the discipline was regarded as too dangerous. Not long after placing second at the Red Bull Vertigo competition in 2002, he found his synchro partner, Argentine Hernán Pitocco. Despite his impressive career, Mr Llorens said the slingshot stunt is 'one of the coolest things I've ever done in my life.' Mr Pitocco moved to La Cumbre, a remote part of the Córdoba province in Argentina, to pursue his love of the sport at 18. 'The first thing I do in the morning when I wake up is look out of the window to test the wind and see if I will be able to fly,' he said. 'Depending on that, I then organise my day.'

"After travelling half way across the globe for two years, Harry McGurk wanted to give his mother the best surprise of a lifetime. The 25-year-old, from Fulham in south-west London, spent two long years backpacking around Australia and some parts of South-East Asia.

"It is not perhaps what one would expect to find in a museum, but in Iceland the humble burger and chips is an endangered item. The McDonald's meal has spent the last year on display in Iceland's national museum, after the final fast food outlet shut down in the country. Now, the salty snack has gone one step further in becoming a historic item, going on display in a hostel - complete with a webcam so fans can document the food as it decays. Scroll down for video . The last McDonald's burger and fries sold in Iceland is now on display at the Bus Hostel in Reykjavik . Bus Hostel in Reykjavik proudly displays the last purchased cheeseburger from the chain, which left Iceland in 2009, on display in their reception area. And yes, it's still in its original wrapper. Iceland's economic crash in late 2008 ultimately led the global fast food chain to close their doors in the country. The last day that locals could pick up a McDonald's burger was October 31, 2009. One particularly forward-thinking man, Hjortur Smarason, went to McDonald's the day before to pick up one of the final offerings - not to eat, but to keep on his garage shelf. The hostel has even set up a livestream - of the burger under glass - to allow fans to watch it rot and decay . The fast foot chain exited Iceland in October 2009, following the country's economic collapse . After a year at the national museum, the burger recently - and inexplicably - moved to the hostel, where it is kept on display under glass. The property has also set up a livestream for those who can't make it to Reykjavik to watch it rot and decay from anywhere in the world. It could be a slow process, however, as the livestream site warns that 'you will have to be patient to see any changes' in its appearance.","Purchased on October 30, 2009, before the chain exited the country .

"A puppy with three legs can't find a home because she keeps getting passed over for able-bodied dogs. Five-month-old Ruby was born with a deformed right front paw which had to be amputated after she was turned into the RSPCA. Puppies are normally snapped up within days, but because of Ruby's disability no one wants to adopt her. Scroll down for video . Ruby, who now has three legs and is pictured above with her carer, Leanne Manchester at the Derby RSPCA Centre, can't find a home because she keeps getting passed over for able-bodied dogs . When Ruby was handed over to the RSPCA her front right paw was deformed and it had to be amputated . Leanne Manchester, from the Derby RSPCA Centre where Ruby is currently being looked after, said the puppy is an 'adorable dog - so friendly and full of life'. Ruby, a rottweiler and Staffordshire bull terrier cross, has been at the centre for a month. Ms Manchester said: 'Her disability means she is still lonely. If she wasn't missing a leg, she would have been rehomed by now.' Ruby's owners took her to the centre because they were struggling to deal with her. A vet later concluded a birth defect had caused her front leg to be folded up and that amputation was the only solution. Because Ruby was already used to getting by with three usable paws she was able to run around straight after surgery. Ms Manchester said if Ruby wasn't missing a leg she would have been been adopted by a new owner by now . Ms Manchester said while Ruby, pictured above before her operation, would be more suited to gentle exercise, rather than long hikes, her disability wouldn't make her more difficult to look after . The rottweiler and Staffordshire bull terrier cross is 'the happiest puppy you will ever meet in your life' And since then Ms Manchester and her team have been taking Ruby to hydrotherapy and physiotherapy sessions to help her build up strength in her legs. Ruby's stump is currently too small for a prosthesis, but Ms Manchester hopes that who ever adopts the puppy might help get the dog back onto four legs. Ms Machester, 25, added: 'She is the happiest puppy you will ever meet in your life. 'Unfortunately, there was nothing that could be done for her.' The RSPCA hopes people can look past Rugby's disability because she is '100 per cent worth it' Ms Manchester said while Ruby would be more suited to gentle exercise, rather than long hikes, her disability wouldn't make her more difficult to look after than an able-bodied dog. She said: 'I think people are concerned that because she only has three legs she will be much more difficult to look after and they are worried about taking on the extra responsibility. 'We wouldn't want people to take home a puppy without thinking it through carefully but Ruby is such a great dog and I hope people can see past her disability to see that. 'She is 100 per cent worth it. 'She will need some more support from her vet than the average dog, but she is fantastic with children and other dogs.'","Ruby had a birth defect which meant her front right paw was folded up .

"Denial of guilt: Brock Allen Turner, 19, has pleaded not guilty to five counts of sexual assault in connection to the January 17 incident . A former Stanford University swim star accused of raping a woman has pleaded not guilty to five counts of sexual assault. Brock Turner was arrested January 18 after being caught on top of an unconscious and half-naked woman outside a fraternity party both had attended. He was not a member of the Kappa Alpha fraternity and the woman was not a Stanford student. The 19-year-old Turner, a three-time All-American high school swimmer from Dayton, Ohio, entered the plea Monday morning. Turner was released on $150,000 bail following his arrest. He has since dropped out of Stanford and is banned from campus. Police say Turner ran away but was caught by two men riding bikes on campus and held until police arrived. In court Monday, Turner was seen sitting next to his attorney and father, dressed in a neat dark suit and vigorously chewing a piece of gum, reported NBC Bay Area. Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky approved a prosecution request for a protective order requiring Turner to stay at least 100 yards away from the woman for one year, a spokesman for the District Attorney's Office said. The judge also denied a request from Turner’s attorney, Michael Armstrong, that Turner not have to appear personally at some upcoming court appearances to avoid costs of traveling from Ohio. Turner, who has withdrawn from Stanford, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted. The charges against him include rape, rape of an intoxicated person, rape of an unconscious person and assault. Scroll down for video . The 19-year-old former Stanford student arrived in Palo Alto court with his father by his side Monday morning . Turner, pictured next to his attorney, was seen chewing gum in court during his arraignment . Brock Turner has reportedly told police he met the woman at the party  and they were kissing outside after he downed nine whiskey and beer drinks. He said he took off the woman's underwear, penetrated her with his hands and touched her breasts, but never took off his pants. According to Turner, the woman appeared to be enjoying herself as she rubbed his back. He added that his 'intentions were not to try and rape the girl without her consent' but to '""hook up"" with a girl,' the report said. The alleged victim gave a statement saying she drank four whiskey shots two hours before arriving at the Kappa Alpha party on January 17. She then 'blacked out' 30 minutes later after two shots of vodka and stepping outside with her sister, her statement continues. Turner was detained on January 18 after allegedly being spotted by two cyclists then trying to flee. The pair managed to tackle him while a third man called the police, Santa Clara County prosecutors say. After his arrest he was released on $150,000 bail. The Ohio-born teenager has been charged with five counts of sexual assault, including rape of an unconscious woman, rape of an intoxicated woman and two charges of sexual assault with a foreign object. The alleged victim was not enrolled at Stanford and was visiting the campus for a party, according to the district attorney's office . 'She was lying on the ground unconscious, not moving,' said Deputy District Attorney Alaleh Kianerci of the alleged victim. 'She's recovering,' Kianerci added. The woman was taken to the hospital and treated for her injuries. If convicted Turner, who raced in the London 2012 U.S. Olympic trials, could face up to 10 years in prison. He voluntarily withdrew from the university yesterday, Stanford spokeswoman Lisa Lapin told the LA Times. Turner is also no longer practicing with his swim team. Turner last swam for the university in a January 10 meet against Pacific, finishing third in the 1,000-yard freestyle and second in the 200-yard backstroke. Heavy.com reports that Turner, originally from Ohio, swam for the Dayton Raiders before being recruited for Stanford and was a three-time All-American high school swimmer at Oakwood High School. Some accomplishments include breaking the Ohio record for fastest time by a male 18 and under in the 800-meter freestyle, winning high school state titles in the 200 and 500 freestyle, and making the U.S. Junior National team. Stanford isn't letting Turner's athletic excellence obfuscate his alleged criminal behavior. 'This is something that the University takes very seriously, and the University took immediate action,' said Lapin to The Stanford Daily. The former first year student is not allowed to re-register for classes and is barred from setting foot on campus, according to Lapin. The alleged attack took place near some student housing and the Kappa Alpha fraternity house, but there is no indication the fraternity is involved in the investigation, she said. The alleged attack took place on Stanford University's campus in Santa Clara County . Turner is expected to appear in court to enter a plea on Monday. SFGate reports that Stanford is among the Universities criticized for having relaxed policies on sexual assault. A law professor at the university, Michele Landis Dauber, has urged the school to make serious changes in their policies towards sexual assault. Only four of the 175 reported sexual assaults at Stanford between 1997 and 2009 were properly investigated. Dauber has called the statistics 'appalling.' Dauber said that despite some improvement by the school in investigating sexual assault cases and acting for welcoming to victims, there is still room for improvement. The school commended the cyclists who stepped in to save the alleged rape victim. 'Several students, both graduates and undergraduates, were upstanders in this situation,' Catherine Criswell, the University's Title IX Coordinator, told the Stanford News Report. 'They made the courageous decision to intervene and provide assistance. That is exactly the type of leadership and caring we attempt to cultivate in our community, and we commend those students on their courage and quick response.'","Brock Allen Turner, 19, says he removed the woman's underwear, penetrated her with his hands and touched her breasts but denies rape .

"An elementary school suspended a boy who arrived at school last week with what he alleged was a powerful ring that appears in J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasy books. Aiden Steward was suspended from Kermit Elementary School in Kermit, Texas, over a Thursday incident, The New York Daily News reported. While speaking to another boy, 9-year-old Steward said he would able to use the One Ring and turn the fellow student invisible, according to the newspaper. Powerful: Aiden Steward was suspended from school after telling a boy he had the One Ring and could make a student become invisible, like in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy books . Speaking to The New York Daily News, father Jason Steward said 'It sounded unbelievable.' The One Ring, as it is known, features in both Tolkien's prequel 'The Hobbit' as well as 'The Lord of the Rings.' At various points in the books, characters Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins put on the ring to make it seem as if they have vanished into thin air. 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy follows a group of characters that set to destroy the One Ring, since it can also be used to control other peoples and kingdoms. Steward told The New York Daily News 'Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly.' The newspaper reported that the Steward family recently viewed 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.' Peter Jackson directed film adaptations for both 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Hobbit.' Magical: Bilbo Baggins (portrayed here by Martin Freeman) is able to get his hands on the One Ring after an encounter with the creature Gollum . Scene: The incident took place at Kermit Elementary School, pictured . Jason Steward told the newspaper 'I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence. If he did, I'm sure he'd bring him right back.' Speaking to The Odessa American, he said the school considered his son's behavior to be a threat. Principal Roxanne Greer did not comment to the website, and said 'All student stuff is confidential.' The website reported 'The 9-year-old has been in in-school suspension for referring to another student’s skin color and got in trouble for bringing a kids’ book about pregnancy to school.' Greer and Kermit Independent School District Superintendent Bill Boyd did not immediately return messages seeking comment from Daily Mail Online.","Aiden Steward was suspended from Kermit Elementary School in Kermit, Texas, over a Thursday incident .

"A family proved to be four of a kind after quitting their day jobs to become card-playing poker champions. Michelle and Matthew Shiels and their sons Richard and Brandon are all aces at the game, honing their skills at their 'house of cards' in Edington, Birmingham. Only last week, 19-year-old Brandon scooped £9,200 in the UK and Ireland Poker Tour tournament, staged in London. Brandon Sheils is pictured left, his brother Richard (right), father Matthew (centre) and mother Michelle have all quit their jobs to become poker champions . But former Birmingham University economics graduate Richard, who did his dissertation on the game, has gone one better. The 23-year-old scooped £27,000 in the Deep Stack contest, staged at Nottingham's Dusk Till Dawn Poker Club. For 24 hours, Richard battled with 328 of the best players in the country, and came out on top. In fact, between them, Brandon and Richard have made a whopping £75,000 since November. As a family, the Sheils take part, on average, in three competitions a week - and they claim there is a reason for their staggering success. Michelle (pictured receiving a poker prize) and husband Matthew have appeared in tournaments on satellite television . Guided by 48-year-old Matthew, a former accountant, and Michelle, who sold her nursery business to concentrate on poker, they say they have replaced the luck, chance and risk with a mathematical formula. Richard, who began playing in earnest after leaving university in 2012, said: 'In our house, there is a fine line between gambling and poker. 'I did my dissertation on poker, the science and maths behind the game. You can see where the gambling is, and where it is not. 'It would be extremely silly to go down the gambling route. If you meet gamblers, you are going to make money from them.' But Richard admitted you can't completely eradicate luck. 'If I played you 100 times, I wouldn't beat you 100 times,' he explained, 'but I would beat you more than 50 times, which would mean I'd make money.' Richard, who spent two months playing the Vegas tables, was introduced to cards at a very early age. He learned to count using a deck. 'Old school poker is very touchy-feely,' he said, 'but nowadays it's all about the maths and theory. Mind you, when we're in a tournament together it becomes very competitive. 'I'm getting better and better. At the moment, I'm a better player than Brandon, but he's improving all the time. I taught him how to play.. I've made the mistakes and made sure he doesn't make them. 'My ambition is to be good enough to play for a living, but rich enough not to have to.' Michelle and Matthew are no slouches and have appeared in tournaments on satellite television. Cards on the table: The family say they have replaced the luck, chance and risk element of the game with a mathematical formula . 'Mum ran a nursery,' Richard explained. 'She sold that, semi-retired and played poker. She's been on Channel 4's Late Night Poker a few times, and her biggest win is £12,000.' Michelle, 41, said: 'Richard and Brandon are better players, to be fair. I'm always asked if I'm better than my husband and he says I am, but I'm not sure. 'I have no fixed plans for the future. Sometimes I get bored with it and go off the boil, then return.'","Michelle and Matthew Shiels and sons Richard and Brandon are all poker experts .

"A mother says her six-year-old daughter is only alive today thanks to the local optician who correctly suspected she had a huge brain tumour. Chrissy Fletcher had become so concerned about her daughter Darcey's headaches that she took her to the local hospital - where doctors simply diagnosed a migraine. It was only when the family optician saw her that she became worried she had many of the telltale signs of a brain tumour. After being rushed back to hospital, doctors discovered Darcey had a  brain tumour the size of an orange - which would have killed her within a week. Risk: Darcey Fletcher would have been dead within a week had an optician not spotted her brain tumour. Her mother Chrissy is furious that doctors at the local hospital did not scan her to test for the condition . Lucky: It was only during an eye test than an optician Mrs Fletcher a leaflet on brain tumours (left). To her horror, Mrs Fletcher realised Darcey (who is now back at school) had seven of the eight warning signs . Recalling the nightmare situation, Mrs Fletcher said: 'Darcey had been ill for about a week in November last year and we thought it was a virus. 'I took her to the doctors because it was not going away and they said it could be migraines or a virus. 'They gave her tablets for migraines. 'We left it for about five days but she was still waking up screaming in pain. I got the doctor out on the Friday and he said to go to Barnsley Hospital.' There, after being seen by a student doctor Darcey was referred to a senior colleague. The doctor carried out a set of tests on the youngster, including those for lack of co-ordination, which is a symptom of having a brain tumour. However he decided not to give Darcey a scan. Mrs Fletcher said: 'He gave her a check-up and was banging her knees. 'She had to walk up and down and do other tests but they still thought it was a virus or something to do with migraines. 'The doctor said ""I know what you are going to ask, you are going to ask for a scan, but she doesn't need one"".' Recovery: She also had surgery to have the orange-sized cancerous tumour cut out of her brain . Mrs Fletcher was then told  she should get Darcey's eyes tested and to come back in a month if they still persisted. Concerned, she took her daughter to the local optician in Skelmanthorpe, West Yorkshire, the next morning. 'They know us well and they looked at her eyes,' said Mrs Fletcher. The optician then gave her a leaflet on brain tumours - and, to her horror, Mrs Fletcher realised Darcey was suffering from seven of the eight warning signs. Mrs Fletcher, who has three older children, said: 'The tumour was too low down for them to see it but they gave me a leaflet and Darcey ticked every box apart from epilepsy.' Terrified, her husband called a family friend, who works as a consultant in Sheffield. She advised the couple to take Darcey to hospital straight away. Within 40 minutes, doctors at Sheffield Children's Hospital had carried out a MRI scan which revealed the orange-sized brain tumour. She then underwent emergency surgery to have fluid drained from her brain and later more surgery the tumour removed. Scarred: Darcey had to undergo emergency surgery to have fluid drained from her brain . Doctors at the hospital told Mr and Mrs Fletcher that had the tumour not been found, Darcey would have been dead within a week. Her mother said: 'It was absolutely crazy. They said if I hadn't brought her in she would have been dead within a week. 'Our world collapsed when they detected the scan. My husband said to the surgeons: ""please tell me you have magic hands"". Symptoms listed on the pamphlet Mrs Flether was given by the optician: . 'Brain Tumours happen. Symptoms include: . *Persistent/recurrent headache . *Persistent/recurrent vomiting . *Balance/coordination/walking problems . *Abnormal eye movements . *Blurred or double vision . *Behaviour change . *Fits or seizures . *Abnormal head position such as wry neck, head tilt or stiff neck . If your child has one of these, see your doctor. If they have two or more, ask for an 'urgent referral'.' 'We just went into overdrive. We were crying but we didn't want to cry in front of Darcey. 'I was so cross when I found out I could have lost her.' 'Barnsley should have done the scan. 'When we found out about the tumour it was like I was watching a film. 'As a mum I know my daughter. I'm not one to take her to the doctors for a cold, it's only when there is something really wrong. 'The surgery was the longest six and a half hours of my life. We were all a right mess.' Darcey stayed in hospital for 11 days and was able to go home in time for Christmas. She is now back in school but needs to go back for a scan next month to make sure that the tumour has not spread to her spine. Mrs Fletcher added: 'I just cannot thank the optician enough. 'It was she who suggested something was seriously wrong after doctors at Barnsley Hospital and thought Darcey may have a virus or possibly migraine. 'I took her a bunch of flowers but it doesn't seem enough.' The family is now considering legal action.

"Zoe Cook, 38, runs a catering company with her husband, Jamie, 39, and lives near Cudham, Kent, with their daughters Lila, nine, and Kiera, seven. Zoe says: . Given that I’ve lost more than 3st and dropped from a size 16 to a size 12 in three years, people assume that I must have been on some sort of extreme diet. Actually, my weight loss and leaner, more toned figure is all down to one 90-minute yoga class a week, plus practising a few poses at home when I get the chance. Scroll down for video . Zoe Cook, 38, (pictured), has lost more than 3st and dropped from a size 16 to a size 12 in three years thanks to one 90-minute yoga class a week . I wouldn’t be without yoga now, but three years ago I had to be persuaded to go my first class. I was convinced it would be full of hippies. I was sceptical about how much difference yoga could actually make, and my husband, Jamie, agreed. ‘You won’t be sweating, so what good will it do?’ he said. My reason for trying it was that I was quite stressed trying to juggle family life with running our catering business. My clothes were tight, I was out of shape, felt sluggish and hadn’t had a good night’s sleep in years. A family member, who is now my yoga teacher, suggested that I should give one of her classes a try. I wasn’t sure, but she was adamant it would help me cope with all the demands being made of me and help me sleep better. She teaches Ashtanga — best known because Madonna does it — which is a fast-paced type of yoga. Ashtanga is very structured and repetitive, and the idea is that you flow between poses without stopping, synchronising your breathing as you do, so the class feels like an exhilarating and challenging workout. But it’s not just for people who are superfit and muscular like Madonna — I’m certainly not. It’s brilliant for people of all fitness levels and flexibility because you’re not in competition with each other, just aiming to improve your own ability. To my amazement, the night after my first class I slept like a baby, which was something I hadn’t done in years. Ordinarily, I would lie awake, fretting about how I’d manage to get everything done the next day, but on that night a bomb could have gone off and I wouldn’t have heard it. A couple of days after the yoga lesson, my muscles ached in a way they had never done after the occasional three or four-mile jog that I’d done in the past. It felt satisfying knowing I’d obviously worked them well, even though it hadn’t really felt like it at the time. Yoga quickly became essential ‘me’ time away from the children and work, even if I could only fit in one session a week. And although I haven’t had a lot of time to devote to yoga, my body shape has changed almost beyond recognition. When I look in the mirror my upper arms, as well as my inner thighs and ‘saddlebags’, have all shrunk and are tighter. My core is stronger and my tummy flatter. I’m now a size 12 and sometimes even a size 10 on my bottom half — I’m 5ft 5in tall. My weight hovers around 9st 7lb, as opposed to the 13st I was before. I lost the first half a stone within a matter of weeks of taking up yoga, and the rest steadily over the next couple of years. When I can’t get to my weekly yoga class — typically during the summer months, when Jamie and I are rushed off our feet with the business — I gain at least half a stone in just a couple of weeks, and feel lethargic and less toned. Pop icon, Madonna (pictured), also practices Ashtanga - a fast-paced type of yoga which is very structured and repetitive . Apart from becoming a yoga devotee, I haven’t really changed a lot else to explain the weight loss. I certainly wouldn’t consider doing a faddy diet. But yoga has had a knock-on effect on the food choices I make. On the day of a class, I eat only a very light dinner, such as a salad — you can’t go to yoga on a full stomach or you’d feel very uncomfortable doing the poses and probably give yourself indigestion. Because doing a class leaves me feeling so good inside, for a couple of days afterwards I find myself naturally drawn towards healthy snacks such as fruit or nuts instead of crisps and chocolate. Even I’m shocked at what a huge impact taking up yoga has had on the shape of my body, and how much more energised and calm I feel. There are postures I still can’t master, but I hope that in years to come I will manage them. So, even though classes follow the same structure each week, yoga never stops being a challenge. I’ll be doing it for the rest of my life now. Reporting by Chloe Lambert, Jill Foster and Sadie Nicholas. 'I dropped two sizes without dieting' Natalie Reid, 38, works part-time in retail. She lives with her partner Dan, 44, and their daughters Rain, ten, and Noa, two, in South West London. She says: . Four years ago my cousin came to my 34th birthday party looking fabulous. She was more toned than she’d been in years and I asked what her secret was. She told me she had started doing yoga, specifically Bikram yoga, and said I should come to a class. At the time I wasn’t very happy with my body. I’d been putting on weight since the birth of my first daughter — before Rain’s arrival I’d been a size 10-12, now I was a size 14 and felt flabby. Natalie Reid, 38, takes classes in Bikram yoga, which is practiced in heats of around 40c. Natalie has lost more than a stone since starting Bikram, despite having made barely any changes to her diet . I knew Bikram yoga was done in high heat, but that was about it. On the internet I learned the heat enables you to stretch into postures more safely. The humidity also promotes sweating, which is believed to help flush toxins from the body. I was intrigued. When I walked into my first class the heat (about 40c or 104f, and 60 per cent humidity) hit me and my first concern was: ‘What’s my hair going to look like after this?’ People say they can’t try yoga because they can’t touch their toes — and that was true with me. I couldn’t do half the things we were being asked to do, but I had a go. At the end I felt invigorated. That day I’d been feeling down, but the yoga left me upbeat and energised. I was hooked. I joined the yoga studio in January 2011 and went every other day for nearly a month. After that, I took out a monthly subscription. I was impressed by how quickly my shape began to change. So did how I felt about my body. After about two months I noticed that my legs were more toned, and so was my stomach. When I found out I was pregnant again, I carried on doing yoga.

"The founder of Lululemon Athletica Chip Wilson, who resigned as chairman last year after suggesting women's fat thighs created problems with a line of his yoga pants, has stepped down from the company's board. Wilson, who established the Canadian company in 1998, upset customers during an interview in November 2013 when he said 'some women's bodies' as part of the reason why the product was recalled earlier for being too sheer. Other problems included pilling, holes, and seams coming apart. Those problems were expensive to fix. Scroll down for video . Controverisal: Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, pictured with his wife Shannon, said that some women's bodies 'don't work' for yoga pants. A year after resigning as chairman he has stepped down from the board . He told Bloomberg TV: 'Frankly, some women’s bodies just don’t actually work.' When speaking about how some customers' complained about the pants' fabric pilling, Mr Wilson continued: 'It’s really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time and how they much they use it.' The founder's remarks caused Bloomberg TV host Trish Regan to cut in and ask: 'Interesting, not every woman can wear a Lululemon yoga pant?' Mr Wilson responded: 'No, I think they can. I just think it’s how you use it.' Following that incident, he agreed to step down as chairman but had remained a board member. Wilson had left Lululemon in 2012 to take a sabbatical in Australia. At the time he had served as chief innovation and branding officer. He was asked by the company's board to come back in the spring of 2013. In mid-2014, Wilson pushed for changes to the company's board of directors, In August, Wilson reached a deal to sell about half of his shares in Lululemon to investment firm Advent International for $845 million in exchange for Advent receiving two seats on the board. Product: He claimed body types were to blame for problems customers were encountering - including pilling, seams coming apart and holes appearing . Wilson still owns about 10.3 million shares, or 7.8 percent, of Lululemon, according to FactSet, a stake worth more than $650 million at Monday's stock price. Wilson said in a statement Monday that it was the right time to step down from the board. He plans to help his wife and son with their new business, Kit & Ace, which sells machine washable cashmere clothing and other apparel and accessories. Lululemon's shares fell 91 cents to $65.33 in morning trading. The shares are up more than 40 percent over the past year.","Chip Wilson founded Canadian company Lululemon in 1998 .

"When the clock strikes midnight on January 1, many people compile a list of New Year's resolutions in a bid to shed away those bad habits and pledge for a fresh start. With January done and dusted, many of those resolutions have already been forgotten or ditched altogether, only to be replaced by the same old routines. 'Australia's Number One Fitness Guy' and former World Ironman Champion Guy Leech believes simply making a resolution isn't good enough to motivate you through to the finish line. The 50-year-old from Sydney's Northern Beaches said quite often he hears people making the same mistake of setting up resolutions they can't measure or track. Fitness expert Guy Leech says simply making a resolution isn't good enough to motivate you to the finish line . The father of two said it's important to find a strong reason behind your resolutions to be able to achieve it . 'If you can't measure it, how can you hope to achieve it?' Leech told Daily Mail Australia. 'There needs to be an important reason behind why you're setting that particular goal. Set a goal that means a lot to you because it'll give you that strength to do it. 'We've seen nine out of 10 goals fail because they weren't strong enough. Only one out of 10 people have made goals that mean a lot to their lives and because of this, they would be committed.' Rather than setting up goals that seem out of reach, Leech suggests breaking down the bigger resolutions into smaller goals that can be achieved slowly as you go. 'Don't say I want to lose 12 kilos or just pick a random number that you want to lose because it'll only make it tough to follow through. You need to set little goals around it to reach that big goal. 'Actually find something that you like  doing. Don't take up a boot camp or a 12-week cross fit program because you feel like you need to - pick something you can see yourself doing. 'And don't be afraid to tell your family and friends what your goals are - what that does is put a lot of pressure on you and they will support you through if you start to feel like giving up. The 50-year-old said writing down your resolutions and looking at it everyday keeps your ambitions alive . As for setting up that 'New Year's resolution', Leech said it doesn't matter when these goals are made . Taking the time to write out resolutions and sticking them in places where you can always see them keeps you motivated and your ambitions at the forefront of your mind. 'When you set your goals -  write it down and look at it everyday. Chances are - if you rarely see your goals, you're likely to forget about them,' Leech said. 'Seeing your goals written out in black and white can work as a powerful motivator, and can really make the difference as to whether you end up achieving them. 'These are all common sense but it's also important to remind ourselves that if we focus too much on numbers [kilograms] and not on the benefits of doing it - it's harder to reach our goals.' When it comes to fitness motivation, the father of two said partnering up with someone who has the same or similar goals could be very helpful. 'Going on the journey with someone is always more fun and more motivating than doing it alone,' Leech said. Leech said rather than setting long term goals that seem out of reach, break your bigger resolutions into smaller goals that can be achieved as you go . Leech is gearing up to break his fourth Guinness World Record for the largest ever Core Fitness Class, which will be held at the Arnold Classic EXPO, in Melbourne in March . Many Australians are caught up in their busy work schedules but Leech suggests trying to move as much as you can is one part of your daily routine to being fit and healthy. 'Find more ways to move - don't take the lift, take the stairs; get off the bus a few stops early or walk to work if possible - it's the simple strategy that anyone can do. 'We are lucky to have the same amount of hours each week and it's not about the time - it's all about the priority. Set your alarm clock earlier so you can do something in the morning. 'Change your cycle around so you're feeling positive and great during the day and you would be able to sleep better and early at night. 'You've got to look for ways to move. Technology has robbed our process of moving - not being able to get up and switch our TV has taken around 10,000 steps away from our lives. As for setting up that 'New Year's resolution', Leech said it doesn't matter when these goals are made during the year. 'You don't need to wait until Christmas or January to start thinking about your  resolutions - being healthy and fit can start any time of the year,' he said. 'There will always be hurdles along the way but once you have a purpose and a big reason behind your resolutions, you'll get to the finish line.' Guy Leech reveals his top tips to make those resolutions go the distance . 1. Why? Why? Why? Simply making a resolution isn't enough, there needs to be an important reason behind WHY you're setting that particular goal. 'If you think about what you stand to gain by achieving a goal, and how you will feel when you get there, it will make it much easier to follow through' explains Leech. To keep your goals front of mind, set up an inspiration board somewhere in your home with quotes, pictures and anything that inspires you and reminds you of your goals. 2. Be S.M.A.R.T . Set yourself up for success by making SMART resolutions, by ensuring your goal is: Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Realistic and Time-based.  It's a really good idea to start a goals diary where you can document the details of your SMART goals and track your progress. 3. Outta' Sight Outta' Mind . Write your goals up and place them in a spot that you frequently see, like on the fridge, the bathroom mirror, or taped to your computer screen at work. 4. Break it up . 'If a resolution is too big, it can be very intimidating and entirely off-putting,' says Leech. 'Provide yourself with achievable milestones along the way to reaching your goal, acknowledge when you achieve each one and reward yourself as you go, rather than just at the end,' recommends Leech. 'For example, if your goal is to run a half marathon, you might set a goal to run 5km, 10km and then 15km by a certain date, gradually working your way to the full distance and high-fiving yourself as your running fitness improves.' 5. Talk about it . Don't be afraid to tell your friends, family and co-workers about your resolutions. 'If the people around you can support your goals, they will be able to keep you on track when you might otherwise be tempted to waiver,' says Leech. Likewise, it's great to partner up with someone so you have you have a buddy to keep you on track and to keep you accountable. 6. Keep tabs on yourself . It's always a good idea keep track of your successes and struggles along the way. Making notes of your weekly efforts or giving yourself a rating out 10 can be a really simple way to keep your motivation up. 'Reflecting on successes and struggles throughout your journey is a really powerful tool as it allows you to be mindful of what does and doesn't work. I find keeping a journal or note book on any fitness journey incredibly important,' says Leech. 7. Control the inner voice . 'Never underestimate the power of what you tell yourself,' insists Leech. 'It is important keep control of the voice in your head and feed yourself positive messages. It is surprising how damaging your negative thoughts can be, while positive thinking pays off in spades.'","Guy Leech reveals top tips to keep New Year's resolutions all year round .

"The mayor of Toledo, Ohio, remains in a critical condition on Monday, a day after having a heart attack while driving in snowy weather that caused him to crash into a utility pole. Mayor Michael Collins, 70, is being heavily sedated and closely monitored at the University of Toledo Medical Center's intensive care unit. Doctors say it is too early to put an estimate on the 'timing or likelihood of his recovery.' Evelyn Johnson, 42, who saw the mayor's crashed SUV around 2pm Sunday stopped, smashed through his locked window and administered CPR until emergency personnel arrived. Freak accident: The mayor of Toledo, Ohio, remains in a critical condition Monday, a day after having a heart attack while driving in snowy weather that caused him to crash into a utility pole . Authorities have extended appreciation to Johnson for her 'heroic efforts'. Dr. Christopher Cooper, a cardiologist and dean of the University of Toledo medical school, said Collins was not conscious when Johnson found him. The retired police officer and former city councilman is married to Sandy Drabik. They have three daughters and eight grandchildren. City Council President Paula Hicks-Hudson, 63, was sworn in as acting mayor Sunday afternoon.

'The act of this one person who was there at our mayor's time of need shows this is a great city,' Hicks-Hudson said at a news conference Sunday. Evelyn Johnson, 42, saw the mayor's crashed SUV around 2pm Sunday and administered CPR . Collins became mayor in January 2014. The independent's first year in office has been tumultuous. Shortly after he was sworn in, two city firefighters died battling an apartment fire, and the city endured the worst winter in its history. Summer brought widespread, toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie that caused the city to cut off water service to 400,000 people in the Toledo area. And in October, it was learned that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles might move production of the Jeep Wrangler from Toledo to another U.S. plant when it redesigns the vehicle. The mayor’s medical crisis followed a meeting he had with a Lucas County Sheriff where it was agreed to issue a Level 3 snow emergency notice, allowing only emergency vehicles on the road. He was alone in his car at the time as he traveled home to South Toledo after picking up groceries in West Toledo. Officials said they would give an update on Collins' condition before midday Monday.","Mayor Michael Collins is being heavily sedated and closely monitored at the University of Toledo Medical Center's intensive care unit .

"Music producer Suge Knight has claimed the hit-and-run incident that killed one man and injured another was an accident and that he was unaware he had injured anyone. Knight's attorney has said the 49-year-old rap legend is an innocent victim who accidentally ran over the men as he tried to escape a vicious attack. James Blatt said Suge Knight, real name Marion Hugh Knight Jr., was called to Tam's Burgers in Compton  for a meeting and was attacked by four people as he slowed his truck. Scroll down for videos . Suge Knight smiles and puffs as he turns himself into the West Hollywood Sheriff's station in Los Angeles, , accompanied by his lawyer James Blatt . The men beat him through his window, tried to pull him outside, and threatened to kill him. After the attack Knight was so 'discombobulated' when escaping the scene that he was unaware that he hit anyone, according to TMZ. Blatt boasted last week that the rap mogul was innocent of homicide and that surveillance footage would prove it. But it has now been revealed that the CCTV camera trained at the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant where Knight allegedly ran over two men, killing one, last Thursday was not working the night in question. The owner of Tam's Burger in Compton, California confirmed the security camera was broken in an interview with TMZ. It actually appears that no security cameras in the area captured the bloody scene, though the parking lot is bordered by a Wells Fargo, Louisiana Fried Chicken and Rite Aid. 'Accident': Terry Carter, 55, left, died in the accident while Cle 'Bone' Sloan, right was injured . Out of order: The owner of Tam's Burgers in Compton, California says CCTV wasn't working the night Knight allegedly killed a man. Above, an LAPD photographer checks the scene of the incident . Law enforcement sources also told TMZ that they are hoping someone filmed the fight on their cell phone footage, though they previously said in statements that they already had video evidence of the killing. Sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida previously said that detectives were reviewing a video, but 'they have made no such arrangements with' Knight's attorney nor did they plan to show it to him. Meanwhile, Knight remained jailed on suspicion of murder after turning himself in early Friday. He's being held on $2 million bail. Sheriff's deputies said Knight hit and killed his friend Terry Carter, 55, with his pickup truck Thursday in the parking lot of a Compton fast-food restaurant, also injuring Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, an actor and film consultant who was hospitalized and in stable condition late Friday. The incident was the latest in a long line of brushes with death and the law for the 49-year-old founder of Death Row Records, one of the genre's leading labels. Knight started the label that helped solidify West Coast rap with Dr. Dre, who had been a member of the legendary group N.W.A. The label also launched the career of Snoop Dogg and had Tupac Shakur in the last months of his life. The fatal run-in occurred a short while after Knight was told by deputies providing security to leave a film location after arguing with Sloan, who was working on the set, during a break from filming a promotional video for the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" about the rise of N.W.A. The argument resumed and escalated a short while later at a fast-food restaurant a few miles away, with Knight and Sloan exchanging punches through his open window, sheriff's Lt. John Corina said. Knight is the founder of Death Row Records, which worked with Tupac Shakur (Knight and the rapper pictured above in August 19996 file photo) in the last months of his life . Corina said Knight backed up his pickup truck and knocked Sloan down. 'Then he puts the truck in drive, drives forward, running over him, and then keeps going forward and keeps on driving, and runs over Carter, who is standing in the parking lot, and keeps on going after that,' Corina said. He said witnesses told investigators it looked like an intentional act. Authorities said they do not believe Carter was involved in the altercation. The incident came less than six months after Knight was shot six times at a West Hollywood nightclub in August — the second shooting he's survived. No arrests have been made. At 6-foot-4 and weighing 325 pounds, Knight has a reputation as an imposing figure that is credited, in part, with helping create Death Row Records when he strong-armed another label to release Dr. Dre from his contract, said Chuck Creekmur, CEO of allhiphop.com. Knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting Tupac Shakur against Biggie Smalls in an East Coast-versus-West Coast rivalry. Knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with Shakur at a Las Vegas hotel, just hours before Shakur was fatally shot while riding in Knight's car just east of the Strip. Smalls, whose real name was Chris Wallace, was shot to death in a similar attack six months later. Knight and Dre later had a falling out, and Dre left. The record company eventually declared bankruptcy and was auctioned off. Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, another former N.W.A. member, were at the film location Thursday, but they didn't see Knight. In November, Knight pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed after a celebrity photographer accused him of stealing her camera in Beverly Hills. Because of prior convictions, he could face up to 30 years in prison.","Suge Knight is accused of a fatal hit and run, that killed Terry Carter .

"The four surviving original copies of the Magna Carta have been brought together for the first time since 1215. Copies of the document - one of the first steps in the journey towards parliamentary democracy - will go on show together at The British Library in central London to mark the 800th anniversary since it was signed. More than 40,000 people entered a public ballot for the chance to see them with 1,215 winning the opportunity to visit the display. Scroll down for video . World first: The four surviving copies of the Magna Carta (British Library copies, top left and bottom right, Salisbury Cathedral copy, top right, Lincoln Cathedral copy, bottom left) have been reunited in London for the first time for a hotly anticipated new exhibition . Historic: King John's 800-year-old seal at the bottom of The British Library's Canterbury Magna Carta . Disappointed: Of the more than 40,000 people who entered a public ballot for the chance to see them only 1,215 will get the opportunity . The documents will be at the library for three days before they are taken to the House of Lords for another day, then two will be returned to the library and the others go back to their homes at Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals. King John agreed the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history. What is Magna Carta? Magna Carta is an 800-year-old document containing the idea that no-one is above the law, and it still forms the foundation of many modern ideas and documents today. What does Magna Carta mean? It means 'Great Charter' in Latin. In fact the whole document is in Latin. When and where was Magna Carta granted? Magna Carta was first drawn up in 1215, granted by King John on June 15 at Runnymede near the River Thames in Surrey. Why was Magna Carta first written and granted? It was originally meant as a peace treaty between King John and his barons, with whom he was at war. Is it true that King John never 'signed' Magna Carta? Yes, at least not in the way we think of signing. Back in the Middle Ages kings never signed their name on documents to pass them into law. Instead John used his Great Seal to authenticate the document. How much of Magna Carta is relevant today? The original Magna Carta had 63 clauses. Today, only three of the original 63 clauses remain on the statute books. Of these three survivors one defends the liberties and rights of the English Church, another confirms the liberties and customs of London and other towns, and the third gives all English subjects the right to justice and a fair trial. Meaning 'The Great Charter', it brought an end to the unlimited power of the monarch and established the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law and had the right to fair trial. The manuscript has a large influence on the rule of law in Britain today, giving all citizens the right to justice and a fair trial. It says: 'No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land. To no-one will we sell, to no-one deny or delay right or justice.' Once sealed by the king, scribes made many copies in medieval Latin, although only four are known to have survived. The Magna Carta influenced not only Thomas Jefferson when he helped draft the Declaration of Independence, but also the writers of the French constitution and the late South African leader Nelson Mandela, who cited it in his famous speech in his own defence at the Rivonia trial in 1964. In a joint statement as they brought the four surviving copies together, the library and the cathedrals said: 'King John could surely never have anticipated the enduring global legacy of Magna Carta when he agreed to its terms in 1215. 'Eight hundred years later, the international interest and excitement about this unification event is testament to the extraordinary significance and symbolic power of these four manuscripts. 'We are thrilled to be staging this moment in history together, as partners, at the start of the 800th anniversary year. For each of our institutions, this unique event marks the beginning of our own celebrations in 2015. 'The British Library, Lincoln Cathedral and Salisbury Cathedral will all be staging exhibitions and events later this year to mark the 800th anniversary of the sealing of this iconic document.' Pioneering: Meaning 'The Great Charter', it brought an end to the unlimited power of the monarch and established the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law. Pictured: Lincoln copy . Royal approval: King John signed with a seal the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history . Eight centuries after King John sent copies of the first Magna Carta across his kingdom, just four remain. Two of the survivors are kept at the British Library, were they lay alongside the other two copies which are usually found at Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals. The two British Library copies came from the private library of the MP and and antique collector Sir Robert Cotton, whose collection of preserved documents laid the foundation for the library back in 1753. One of these manuscripts was almost destroyed in a fire in 1731, suffering some damage but remaining largely intact.. Staff at the British Museum Library in the early 19th century also made it harder to read by using outdated techniques to flatten and mount the historic document. The Salisbury Magna Carta has been at the Cathedral since the 13th century. It may have been deposited there by William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury and one of King John’s chief advisers, or it may have come from Elias of Dereham, who supervised the building of the Cathedral from the 1220s. The manuscript has rarely left the Cathedral in its 800 year history. The Lincoln Magna Carta has belonged to the Cathedral for 800 years. It is arriving at the British Library directly from the United States after going on display in Massachusetts and Washington, DC, where over 200,000 people viewed it. On its return to Lincoln, the manuscript will move from the Cathedral into a new permanent home at the ‘Magna Carta Vault’ in nearby Lincoln Castle.

"Matthew Dunford, pictured at an earlier court hearing, who has been found guilty of harassment at Hammersmith Magistrates Court today . A fitness fanatic dubbed 'Britain's vainest man' set up a fake website claiming his Brazilian lapdancer former girlfriend was a prostitute because she wouldn't get back with him, a court has heard. Image-obsessed Matthew Dunford attempted to extort £5,000 from Brazilian model Amanda Branco who once worked as a stripper. When she refused to pay, the 30-year-old then mocked up the escort website profile and sent it to her mother and sister. He was then charged with stalking and was awaiting trial but he still went on to Facebook to repeat the false allegations that Ms Branco was a call girl and linked it to her employer's page. Today, Dunford of Westbourne Park, west London was found guilty of two counts of harassment without violence after he failed to turn up at Hammersmith Magistrates Court. The court was told how Dunford had met Ms Branco in Ireland and they then went on to work at the same branch of Gymbox in Holborn, central London. But when the six-month fling ended in October 2013, the personal trainer bombarded her with calls, texts and emails. Ms Branco told magistrates: 'I went to Brazil for three months to get away from him. 'The day I got back - I don't know how he found out - he left me a voicemail screaming ""are you back, are you back, are you back?"" 'He kept asking me to meet him, he said he had problems with drugs and needed my friendship to move on and go back to the gym and move on my life. I was getting 30 calls a day. 'When I went to meet him he cried and cried on the street. I told him we couldn't be friends.' Dunford, who claims he spends £10,000-a-year on his looks, then tried to blackmail Ms Branco, a former lap dancer from Rio de Janeiro, the court heard. She said: 'In February 2014 he said he found out I wasn't just a stripper, [he thought] I was an escort. 'He started blackmailing me, saying he wanted £5,000 for what I did to his life. 'I felt scared and then he started saying if you don't reply, wait and watch what is going to happen. 'He said you have until midnight and he gave me an address for a hotel just five minutes from my house.' Ms Branco ignored the sinister threats, but she added: 'He photoshopped a website saying I was an escort, he sent it to my mum and my sister.' The World Beauty Fitness and Fashion World Championship contestant then called police when Dunford arrived her flat demanding to be let in - claiming he wanted to collect his nutritional supplements. Dunford had previously been dubbed 'Britain's vainest man' after claiming he spends £10,000 a year maintaining his looks . Hammersmith Magistrates heard how the personal trainer, pictured, bombarded his victim with calls, texts and emails . Although she refused to let him into the building, she explained: 'He came up and my flatmate said ring the police. 'We told him. He said ""yes you can call - say there is a very good-looking guy with blonde hair.'' Dunford was arrested, bailed and warned by police to leave Ms Branco alone but she continued to received hate-filled messages from someone called 'Family Destroyer'. One read to the court said: 'You are evil. Look what you have done to a family and you still drag us through it. 'You could have stopped this months ago, you know you lied to the police. God sees everything.' Dunford was first charged with harassment in May last year but he failed to show up to court two weeks later. The bodybuilder eventually pleaded not guilty and had been due to face trial in September. Dunford attempted to extort £5,000 from Brazilian model Amanda Branco, pictured, who once worked as a stripper. When she refused to pay, the 30-year-old then mocked up the escort website profile . However while awaiting trial he continued to bombard Ms Branco over Facebook, publicly repeating his allegations that she was a prostitute. She said: 'I'm a personal trainer, I'm self employed and if he messes up my work I don't get paid. 'He is destroying my work life and my family life. Luckily the gym managers know what is happening but the members saw this as well as my clients. He went too far.' Dunford was arrested for the second time and had been due to stand trial today, but failed to turn up. His lawyer Norman Cho said his client had been taken ill last night and taken to hospital near his parents' home in Milton Keynes, but added he was discharged a few hours later. Ms Branco, a former World Beauty Fitness and Fashion World Championship contestant ignored the sinister threats but called police when he arrived her flat demanding to be let in . Magistrate Deidre Hopkins allowed the trial to go on without him because of his repeated failure to attend court. Finding him guilty she said: 'It's worth noting that the defendant... was awaiting trial for these charges and on conditional bail, the condition not to contact the complainant. 'The course of conduct amounted to harassment and beyond reasonable doubt we find the defendant guilty of both charges.' She also issued a warrant for his arrest.","Matthew Dunford had been in a relationship with model Amanda Branco .

"The honeymoon. It happens once (you hope). The holiday to beat all others. Naturally, I left my fiancé, Charlie, to take the honeymoon helm. He was sailing solo. And it wasn't until we arrived at Heathrow that the itinerary of a Kenyan safari and Zanzibar was revealed. What a man. What a husband! Sipping champagne on the deck of our tent at Ol Seki, transfixed by a giraffe gliding across the waves of red, green and ochre plain below, the months of nagging Charlie about booking vaccinations and checking luggage were almost forgotten. A job well done, sir: Kate with her new husband and travel planner extraordinaire, Charlie . A note to grooms-to-be: a weight allowance and 'beach clothes plus a cover-up' is not sufficient packing guidance for even the most low-maintenance fiancée. Nor, as it turned out, was it accurate for a safari. The savannah gets cold. But despite being dressed in almost every item in my 15kg bag the next morning, I still couldn't do anything but grin. It was all too perfect. Ol Seki is a beautiful ten-tent camp on the 200 sq km Naboisho Conservancy, bordering the Masai Mara National Park. Land is rented from the local Masai, creating a partnership between traditions and tourism. Ol Seki is fully involved in local life - from dispatching the tractor to help nearby villages to supporting the Koiyaki Guiding School, which trains Masai and counted our guide Raphael among its alumni. Our first game drive was stupendous. My heart thudded as a male lion strutted a metre from us. It was quiet, save for the click of my camera as an elephant padded silently, with a grace unbefitting his size. And we were so absorbed watching the red sun rise over the hills and spill its fiery morning light across the plains that the camera didn't even get a look in. We were there for the great migration, voted by USA Today as one of the New Seven Wonders Of The World. Around July and August, conveniently timed for summer honeymoons, 1.5million wildebeest, 350,000 Thomson's gazelles and 200,000 zebras cross the Mara River from the Serengeti into Kenya. It's rush hour on the savannah. Our final evening's drive (night drives are banned in the Mara and you have to keep to the tracks) finished with a surprise dinner on a rocky promontory in the middle of the wilderness. A little patch of paradise: Zanzibar is blessed with white-sand beaches and splendid hotels . Camp fire at our feet, gin to our lips and a blanket of stars over our heads, we were sold on safaris. Then we left Ol Seki and headed to its equally attractive sister hotel in Nairobi. Opened last year, Hemingways Nairobi offers the perfect rest after bone-rattling dawn drives. You can even check in for just the afternoon between flights to stretch your legs on the manicured lawns, take a massage or do laps of the pool. Rested and ready for our next adventure, we caught a flight from Nairobi to Zanzibar. This exotic island has been attracting visitors for centuries. Arab merchants, European explorers and Indian tradesmen were brought by monsoon winds, seduced by spices, bazaars, or, shamefully, the slave trade. This painful memory is addressed at the Anglican Cathedral in Stone Town. Built on the site of the old slave market, the altar poignantly stands where once was the whipping post. An hour's drive from Stone Town, on the east coast is the six-villa Palms hotel, part of the Zanzibar Collection. Everything is beautiful, from the hand-carved woodwork and culinary masterpieces leaving the kitchen, to the staff 's welcoming smiles and views across the Indian Ocean, which changes colour with every sip of your sundowner. Even we - cynics of anything involving hearts and rose petals - couldn't help being swept up by how romantic the resort is. By the end of the first day we were strolling on the beach hand in hand, drunk on the cornflour soft sand and electric sea. We were helped by the charming manager Siriak. He took joy in finding every opportunity to surprise us, from surreptitiously running a candle-lit bath to secretly setting up our lunch under a palm canopy on the beach. Honeymoon cliche we may have become, but deserted beaches these are not. This island paradise comes with a backbone and life zinging through the sand. Our beach lunch was happily disturbed by migrating cattle and fishermen cycling past. At low tide, we walked out to the reef, passing locals searching the bath-warm water for sea snails. Roar power: Kate and Charlie spent happy days amid the wildlife of Kenya's Masai Mara . Further down the beach is the village of Bwejuu, where the hotel group has built a maternity clinic and a mosque for the locals. The sand here is covered with half-buried tyres. Not litter, but each one marking where a coconut has been buried to soften and make into rope. Family-run, the Zanzibar Collection has three, soon to be four, exquisite properties along the same stretch of coast. The location was chosen by the owner's father, based on an old British map showing a well. It was never found, but this didn't stop the family from forging ahead. Its other hotels, Breezes and Baraza, sit next door to Palms, and each reflects a different part of Zanzibar's history. Palms is inspired by the Swahili heritage; Breezes has a European feel; while the 30-villa Baraza, with its huge pool and serene courtyards, nods to the Arabian past. Palms guests can enjoy the sister hotels, too. Breezes has a diving school and offers private dinners fit for sultans. When we decided to prepare ourselves for the return to a life less horizontal, we joined a snorkelling safari and worked off lunch at Baraza's tennis courts. Charlie had done well, seriously well. I'm normally in charge of travel arrangements, but on our return I made a decision. I gave him the travel trousers - for him to have and to hold, from this day forward, till death us do part.

"Workers are burrowing through 700 feet of rock and dirt to stop New York City's drinking water from seeping into the ground before it gets to the city. Once they dig down below the Hudson River, crews will build a 2.5-mile bypass tunnel to replace a section of the Delaware Aqueduct that has been leaking up to 35million gallons of water each day for decades. The $1.5billion project, which takes place about 75 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, will enable the longest continuous tunnel in the world to continue providing about half of the metropolis's water. Scroll down for video . Problem with the plumbing: Crews in Wappinger, New York, are working on a project to fix a section of the Delaware Aqueduct that provides New York City with about half its drinking water . Can you dig it? Workers are digging 700 feet below the ground to repair and replace parts of the tunnel, which was made in the 1940s . Underground leak: Two shafts are being built on opposite sides of the Hudson River in Wappinger and Newburgh, New York on either side of the tunnel's major problem . Upriver: The major problem in the Delaware Aqueduct is below the Hudson River between Wappinger and Newburgh, two towns roughly 75 miles north of Manhattan . Crews are blasting through hundreds of feet of shale and building a shaft on each side of the Hudson River to reach the 85-mile World War II-era tunnel. The work illustrates the ingenious complexity of delivering 1.1billion gallons of water for 9 million people and the intricate efforts to keep water flowing smoothly as the sprawling network of tunnels ages . The Delaware Aqueduct will have to be temporarily drained for repairs in 2022 during the end stage of the project. A portion of the  price tag is devoted to making sure other water sources continue to flow smoothly during the shut-off, the first time since the late 1950s. The tunnel was constructed between 1939 and 1944 and runs as deep as 1,500 below ground at some points, according to CENews. 'The goal of the city in constructing the waterworks was to construct something comparable to the great works of Rome, to last through the ages,' said Paul Rush, deputy commissioner of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection. 'It's with that spirit and with that purpose that this work here continues the tradition.' More than a trickle: Parts of the Delaware Aqueduct north of New York City leak as many as 35million gallons of water every day . Long way down: The aqueduct, which was built during the World War II-era, goes as low as 1,500 below ground at some points . The Delaware Aqueduct carries 500 million gallons of water a day from four reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains in southeastern New York state to a distributing reservoir at the city's doorstep. The tunnel, wide enough to drive a car through, is one of two major arteries that carry unfiltered water from bucolic countryside areas of the Catskill and Delaware watersheds. The aqueduct, a marvel of engineering relies solely on pressure and gravity but is aging. The Department of Environmental Protection has known of leaks since the the 1990s and has monitored the tunnel with a camera-equipped Automatic Underwater Vehicle, or submarine drone. The area where the aqueduct goes through limestone are lined with steel, and cracks have formed when the tunnel transitions back to reinforced concrete. The waterway is so leaky in one stretch through rural Wawarsing that New York City is buying dozens of homes above it that were plagued with repeatedly flooded basements and squishy lawns. Residents often spend money pumps and other repairs to combat the damage and the DEP has given millions to help the . The leaks are far worse where the tunnel travels under the Hudson by Newburgh, but homes are not affected. Between 15 million and 35 million gallons of water seep through cracks each day, enough to quench a small city. The bypass will permanently replace the leakiest portion of the tunnel. The other cracked stretch will be repaired using grout. Working around the problem: Crews will build a 2.5-mile bypass tunnel to replace parts of the Delaware Aqueduct with the worst flooding . Pavement problems: Cracks have formed in the tunnel where the steel lining in limestone areas turns back into reinforced concrete . Load of rubble: Piles of blasted shale rock need to be scooped up and taken to the surface in the repetitive process needed to reach hundreds of feet below ground . Before workers begin digging the bypass tunnel next year, they first need to complete the entry shafts on opposite sides of the Hudson River at Newburgh and Wappinger. Since late 2013, workers have been drilling into the shale, scooping up the blasted rocks with a crane and then repeating the process. The result is a deep, 30-foot diameter shaft in Wappinger. Workers in hard hats guide giant buckets of rock from the dark, drizzly bottom to the disc of daylight high above. 'It's a very repetitive process,' said George Schmitt, a project manager. The massive project, scheduled to finish in 2023, is just one big-ticket item needed to keep water flowing smoothly through the massive system. A filtration plant in the Bronx expected to handle up to 30 per cent of the city's needs will cost $3.5 billion, and $4.7 billion has been spent to build a third water tunnel beneath the city. Ambitious aqueduct: Paul Rush, (left) deputy commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, said that New York City wanted to construct a waterworks system comparable to Ancient Rome . Long wait: The bypass tunnel and other parts of the project are scheduled to be completed in 2023 after the temporary shutdown of the Delaware Aqueduct . The work that will repair, rather than replace, the other leaky stretch is especially tricky because the aqueduct carrying half the city's water will have to be shut down for six months starting in 2022. The shutdowns means four of the city's major reservoirs will be out of service temporarily. Keeping the water flowing while patching up a main artery can be as tricky as repairing an airplane in flight. But Mr Rush said the city will rely on alternate water sources and conservation. The roughly century-old Catskill Aqueduct, which is 74 miles long, will be scrubbed and updated to increase its flow in time for the shutdown of its companion aqueduct, and the city will rely on water from Croton and wells in Queens. On the conservation side, the New York City plans to update bathroom fixtures in its public schools and has started a voucher program for up to 800,000 water-saving toilets for qualified houses and apartments. If all goes as planned, New Yorkers turning their faucets will never notice. 'It will happen seamlessly in the city,' Mr Rush said. 'They will continue to get their water.' A billion gallons a day: Numerous measures to keep New York City's water flowing, including a filtration plant in the Bronx, are being taken in advance of the aqueduct's shutdown . Makover money: More than $8billion dollars have been spent on improvements to New York's water system besides the Delaware Aqueduct repairs .","Crews repairing 85-mile long Delaware Aqueduct in upstate New York .

"A mother who pays £130 a month to drive her autistic son to school has hit out at the 'unfair system' after Katie Price revealed her son's transport is paid for by the taxpayer. Caren Taylor, 44, spoke after the millionaire glamour model defended her right to have council-funded taxi rides for her 12-year-old disabled son Harvey. Mrs Taylor and her husband, a telecommunications worker, receive no council support for their son Reiss, also 12, who attends a special school. She says driving 32 miles a day to and from his school has left her unable to hold down a job. 'Unfair system': Caren Taylor, 44, spoke after Katie Price defended her right to have council-funded lifts for her son Harvey, 12. Mrs Taylor has to pay £130 a month in petrol to take her son Reiss (right) to school . She and husband Stephen, from Wigan, Lancashire, said they were left feeling unfairly treated after hearing the revelation from Katie Price on Celebrity Big Brother. Reiss and Harvey are the same age. Both have severe autism, both attend special schools assigned to them by the council and both schools are outside the council area where they live. Harvey also has severe disabilities alongside his autism. He suffers from a genetic condition which has left him blind and unable to walk long distances unaided. He also has ADHD. Because councils examine cases individually without looking at income, there are differences from one area or one case to the next. That means Miss Price has received support from her local council, thought to be West Sussex, but the Taylors have not had any transport paid for by Wigan Council. Mrs Taylor said: 'I don't blame Katie Price at all. She is taking what has been offered to her, despite the fact she probably doesn't need it. Mother and son: Katie Price defended her right to have taxpayer-funded taxi rides for Harvey (left with her at a film screening in February last year) 'I just feel that everyone should be put into the same boat, no matter who they are. It's something that really needs highlighting. 'The system seems so unfair. It costs us approximately £130 a month in fuel, which we can barely afford. 'I have to go on the M6 where there can be a lot of traffic. It can take between 25 minutes to an hour and a half, and I have to make that journey twice a day. 'I know of at least three other families whose special needs children are educated out of borough and are provided with either transport or given a fuel allowance, so why are we treated differently?' Mrs Taylor, who gave up her job as an operations manager when Reiss was two, described her son as 'much like a toddler' who struggles to understand his surroundings and personal safety. 'He gets into everything,' she said. 'He will go to a hot stove when it's on. He's got no concept of road awareness whatsoever. 'He would run across a road if he saw something on the other side.' Mrs Taylor and her husband have another son, ten-year-old Mitchell. She said her husband, a former telecommunications firm supervisor, was unemployed for four months last year after being 'unfairly dismissed', a claim he plans to fight in a tribunal. That left the parents almost penniless while they tried to keep paying for fuel. Although Mr Taylor, 47, is now working for another telecommunications firm, he is earning £6,000 a year less and the family struggles to make ends meet. 'We were unable to claim benefits during this time and so ended up having to spend most of our life savings,' Mrs Taylor said. 'He has a new job, but is on a lower wage and I can't work as I need to do the school runs.' Reiss joined his current school, Wargrave House in Newton-Le-Willows, Lancashire, after his mother removed him from Wigan's Landgate School in 2012 because he was unhappy and losing weight. She also said several parents had concerns about the way pupils were treated at the school. The old school was just a mile from his home, and the new school is eight miles away. She said she had to home-school him for more than a year while she waited for Wigan Council to arrange his new placement. After the place was confirmed, the family said they made two requests for help - and both were refused, despite their situation becoming far more desperate. Mrs Taylor's husband not only lost his job but was also diagnosed with skin cancer, and her father had a stroke. School: Reiss' new school, the Wargrave House School eight miles away, is designed for autistic pupils . Mrs Taylor added: 'When we applied for transport after he had started, we were given an outright ""no"". 'I told the Local Education Authority about the amount of pressure I was going through but they made no effort to help us in any way, making the process as difficult as possible. 'The second time they've just seen that they've declined us before and not even bothered to look into our circumstances again.' James Winterbottom, Wigan Council's interim director of children and families, said: 'The council’s view was that Reiss's special educational needs could be met in the borough. 'It was considered to be parental choice that Reiss attended Wargrave School, and therefore as part of the agreement with parents the council would name Wargrave on the condition that parents meet the transport costs and the parents agreed to this.' Katie Price passionately defended her right to bill the taxpayer for Harvey's transport after revealing the situation on Celebrity Big Brother. A spokesman for Miss Price said in a statement: 'Where any child that is placed in school out of the immediate home area it is the Local Authorities' DUTY to provide transport that meets the child's needs. 'This is common practice for all disabled children as there are not enough suitable schools available to them.' Debate: Katie Price made the comments about her son's transport in the Celebrity Big Brother house while talking to Katie Hopkins (right). Miss Price said councils have a duty to provide transport for disabled pupils . Miss Price said paying for her private driver, a private nurse and fuel for the one and a half hour round trip to Harvey's London school would cost £1,000 a day. 'The cost of the school placement together with transport is not means tested as it is provided for the child,' she added. 'Local Authorities do not have special needs schools locally as these have been closed during the last 15 years as it was deemed a cheaper option to transport children out of borough. 'If Harvey's school was on his doorstep as with schools for healthy children, then this would not apply, but it was the government's choice to close the special needs schools.' Councils must to provide transport to any pupil who is deemed to need it as part of their statement of Special Educational Needs. This transport can range from paid-for taxis and minibuses to bus and train passes, fuel allowances and 'independent travel training'. Many councils have been trying to cut down on the number of taxis they use in order to save money. West Sussex County Council, believed to be the responsible for the area where Katie Price lives, guarantees free transport with no means-testing for all children with special educational needs who cannot attend a school within three miles of their home. The council says that the use of taxis rather than bus, car or train is allowed 'in exceptional circumstances only, usually for children with severe disabilities'.","Caren and Stephen Taylor send autistic son Reiss, 12, to a special school .

"The facial mask, which contains 24 carat gold dust, is on sale on the High Street for £9.99 . It is a craze which has seen celebrities and the super-rich splashing out thousands of pounds to have their faces caked in 24 carat luxury. Undergoing gold facials in a bid to banish wrinkles, however, is an expensive trend out of reach of most ordinary working women. Until now. For the first time in the UK a new do-it-yourself face mask, which contains 24 carat gold dust, is going on sale on the High Street for less than a tenner. Containing a range of vitamins, minerals and marine algae, the Casmara Gold rejuvenating facial claims to offer all the anti-aging benefits of a boutique salon experience for a fraction of the price at home. Costing £9.99, the mask is formed by mixing a powder and gel together, before being applied onto the face to create a gold ‘second skin.’ This solidifies and becomes rubbery in texture and is left on the face for 20 minutes. The gold particles work to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by triggering the replenishment of collagen – the substance vital for giving skin elasticity which depletes with age. Although some experts are sceptical, others believe gold has the ability to remove bacteria from the face, helping reduce conditions such as acne, as well as promoting lymphatic drainage, thus reducing dark circles under the eyes. They also say gold can stimulate blood circulation, helping the skin to remove toxins quicker and more efficiently, making for a clearer, more even skin tone. The mask also contains marine algae, a powerful natural moisturiser, while a combination of vitamins A, C and E work to boost skin thickness and tone, helping to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. The mask also cools the skin as it works, reducing puffiness. Users are able to peel off the mask from the forehead to the neck in a single piece. It remains active for 24 hours and can be re-used if refrigerated. They are also encouraged to apply a moisturising cream, which comes as part of the mask kit, beforehand. This contains Aurealis, an active ingredient derived from bitter orange which claims to boost the production of hyaluronic acid – a substance found naturally in the body which can hold up to 3,000 times its weight in water, giving it the ability to quench dry skin, retain moisture and combat wrinkles. In clinical trials, conducted on 50 women and 25 men, aged between 21 and 66, more than 90 per cent said their skin felt more hydrated for at least 24 hours after using the mask and the same number said it smoothed imperfections and restored their complexion’s natural glow. Previously the rich and famous have paid thousands for 24-carat treatment from spa specialists . Hollywood actresses Nicole Kidman (left) and Cameron Diaz (right) are said to fans of the once-expensive treatment . Eight out of ten also said their skin felt tighter, smoother and more refined. Joe Mitchell, beauty innovation buying manager at Boots, where the mask is on sale, said: ‘There are some products that you just have to try as soon as you see them and at Boots we’re always looking to bring these to our customers. ‘Algae is being used in new and interesting ways in beauty, and in looking for breakthrough algae products I found Casmara. It looked totally different to anything I’d seen before, not least because it contains gold. You quickly feel your skin getting colder as it gets to work, and it delivers on its promise of instantly softer skin.’ A BBC documentary last month claimed that celebrities were spending up to £29,000 a year on gold facials. Hollywood actresses Nicole Kidman and Cameron Diaz are reportedly fans and Brits, including model Lisa Snowdon, TV presenter Donna Air and singer Ellie Goulding have all splashed out on the treatments, which can cost up to £1,000 a time. Historically, the use of precious metals for beauty goes back centuries. It is said that Cleopatra slept in a gold mask every night, and Chinese empresses supposedly used gold rollers to massage their faces.","Do-it-yourself gold face mask goes on sale on the High Street for just £9.99 .

"A brain-damaged boy whose parents had asked doctors to turn off his breathing-support has now undergone a possible life-saving surgery after being sponsored by a charity. Xiong Junyi, from Anhui, east China, suffered severe brain damage in an accident at his father's workplace, when he got stuck on a mail delivery conveyor belt. His parents Zhengqing, 35, and Guangqun, 33, were unable to pay for the care of the sick toddler, so had asked medical staff to take him off life support. Saved: Xiong Junyi was severely brain damaged in an accident at his father's place of work and unable to afford the right care for him, his parents wanted to turn off his life support . However, after an unnamed local charity heard about the family's plight, they stepped in to cover the cost of life-saving brain surgery and aftercare for Xiong. The 18-month-old's parents had taken him to visit his father at work at a courier firm in the Hekou township in Huoqiu county in central China's Henan province on December 1st last year. Xiong somehow ended up getting trapped in a conveyor belt used to deliver parcels, leaving him horrifically injured and on life support in the local hospital. Xiong was in the hospital in Anhui for over a month after the accident, and was not able to move or talk. He also had difficulty swallowing and breathing after being discharged. His parents applied for his life support to be switched off, as they were unable to afford proper care for him, which would lead to him slowly dying in severe pain. New beginning: The story of Xiong's accident and his parents heartbreaking choice  attracted international attention and after a charity stepped in to help, he successfully underwent brain surgery in Shanghai . Accident: Xiong was involved in an accident while visiting his father at his place of work, a courier delivery firm, when he got stuck on a conveyor belt . Family care: Guangqun, 33, feeds her 18-month-old son in the hospital in Shanghai . Their request was rejected by the local civil affairs bureau because euthanasia is illegal in China. However Xiong's story attracted international attention and after a charity stepped in to help, he successfully underwent brain surgery at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai last week. Dr Li Hao, director of the children hospital's neurosurgery department, said that the follow-up rehabilitation will need a good deal of time, energy and money, and that they were optimistic the boy would have a chance of recovery, although it was still unclear to what degree. He said: 'We can't promise how well he can recover. The best result would be that he can take care of himself in the future.' The boy's father told Shanghai Daily: 'The thought of euthanasia came about because we could see no solution and couldn't bear to see our son suffer every day.' He said: 'We knew that many people would condemn us when they realised that we wanted to ask permission for our son to die, and two-months-ago I would have also said it was unthinkable whatever the circumstances. A mother's love: The toddler's parents saw no other way out when they asked for doctor's to let him die . No choice: Guangqun and her husband's request was rejected  because euthanasia is illegal in China . Guangqun is seen preparing a medication for Xiong who now has a chance to recover from the accident . 'But the counterpoint as a parent is whether it's just as unthinkable to see so much suffering continue with someone you love. 'Our son was lying in intensive care and the doctor said that because of the massive brain damage he suffered, there was no chance of a proper recovery. When he finally woke up he couldn't even feed himself, and all he can do is breathe unaided. 'We could not even afford the drips to feed him after the money ran out, and are having to inject milk directly into his stomach to keep him alive.' They said that they had run up massive debts and that after taking the boy home it was a living nightmare watching their child struggling for every breath. Zhengqing said earlier: 'His eyes were rolling around inside his head because of the effort of breathing, and the doctors have confirmed the diagnosis that there is no chance he will get any better.' But after the charity came forward and offered to help, he said: 'This hospital is one of the best in the country and we will work with doctors in any way we can to help our boy. Now at least there is hope.'","Xiong Junyi suffered brain damage in incident at his father's job .

"Australian Captain Michael Clarke says his courageous effort to overcome injury is inspired by the late Phillip Hughes, whose memory is the reason he ‘gets out of bed every day’. Clarke is currently undergoing gruelling daily rehab, desperately working to return to the field after surgery on his torn hamstring in December. The determined 33-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that he remains motivated by his promise to honour his ‘little brother’ Hughes. ‘Phillip Hughes is what gets me out of bed every day. He is the reason I get up at 5am to train and recover,’ Michael Clarke told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I will play as much for him as I will for me. That is my driving force.’ Scroll down for video . Michael Clarke (left) says his mate, the late Phillip Hughes (right) is the driving force behind his passionate and relentless efforts to play cricket again . Phillip Hughes was tragically killed after a catastrophic accident whilst batting in a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG in November 2014 . Michael Clarke was a pillar of strength for Hughes’ family, his teammates and the entire Australian community in the wake of the devastating accident at the SCG which claimed Hughes’ life . Phillip Hughes was killed during a Sheffield Shield match in November when he suffered a blow to the head by a cricket ball, resulting in a catastrophic brain injury. Clarke is mindful of making the most of opportunities after Hughes’ untimely death. ‘My rehab is fulltime, eight hours a day, but it will be worth it when I’m back on the park,’ said Clarke. ‘I do it because of the fact is, I can still play. I am lucky,’ he said. Clarke’s memories of Hughes are never far from his mind and play an important part in his decision-making today. ‘I spoke to Phil a lot and when we’d talk about how long I’d play for, he’d always say that he wanted me to keep playing,’ Clarke told Daily Mail Australia. ‘He keeps me going.’ Clarke’s memories of Hughes (pictured) are never far from his mind and play an important part in his decision-making today . ‘My relationship with Phil wasn’t about cricket. It was a lot more than that. I mean, of course he respected me as a captain and everything, but he was my little brother,' Clarke said of Hughes (pictured) ‘I will play as much for Phillip as I will for me. That is my driving force,' Clarke said of his relentless approach to his rehabilitation, motivated by his goal of playing cricket again . Clarke was a pillar of strength for Hughes’ family, his teammates and the entire Australian community in the wake of the devastating accident at the Sydney Cricket Ground which claimed Hughes’ life. Every day the Australian captain was at Hughes’ bedside at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney, as the nation prayed that the young batsman with a cheeky smile and so much promise would recover. After Hughes’ heartbreaking death, Clarke travelled to the batsman’s hometown of Macksville in northern NSW. He delivered a moving eulogy and was an unwavering support to Hughes’ loved ones. ‘Phillip would have done the same for me,’ Clarke said of the support he has given to the Hughes family. In January, Phillip Hughes’ father Greg, mother Virginia and siblings Megan and Jason showed enormous strength by returning to the the SCG, the ground where Hughes was felled. They watched the Test between Australia and India with Clarke was by their side. ‘My relationship with Phil wasn’t about cricket. It was a lot more than that. I mean, of course he respected me as a captain and everything, but he was my little brother. ‘Phillip and I were really close, his family and I are really close and I will always do whatever I can for them.’ However, all-too-aware of the inexplicable loss they feel, Clarke adds ‘I only wish I could do more.’ After Hughes’ heartbreaking death, Clarke travelled to the batsman’s hometown of Macksville in northern NSW.He delivered a moving eulogy and was an unwavering support to Hughes’ loved ones . A young fan who looked up to Hughes left a touching handwritten note on the Macksville pitch where the Australian cricketer first learnt how to play . Clarke has the utmost faith that he will overcome his injury and play again for ‘Hughesy’. He spoke with Daily Mail Australia as part of the Oral B ‘Gnashes’ promotion, which is recruiting to get Aussies on board with a dental hygiene campaign. ‘I am only 33 years old, I have a lot more to give,’ said Clarke. ‘I have a lot to offer. I’m fit and healthy so I will keep getting out of bed at 5am and trying to get back to my best.’ The World Cup this month and the Ashes in July are looming, yet Clarke insists he is focussed on returning to the game whenever he is ready. ‘I haven’t set a time frame for myself at all, all of us would love to go out and win the World Cup and I would love to be in England for the Ashes.’ ‘But I’m not going to prioritise certain events. I’m only 33 years old, I know I have a lot more to give, . Michael Clarke returned to the pitch for the first time since his surgery during a Sydney club game last weekend between Western Suburbs and Gordon . Kyly Clarke speaks with her husband Michael outside the dressing rooms during the lunch break as he bats in the Sydney Grade game between Western Suburbs and Gordon at Chatswood Oval on January 31 . There have been media reports criticising Clarke and his role as captain. Clarke admits that he is aware of the reports and does keep track of the commentary in the media. ‘I read everything out there about me pretty much but I do try not to take it on,’ Clarke conceded with a laugh. ‘I think sport in Australia is so important. We should be proud of our athletes.’ ‘I myself have respect for so many athletes out there and how they represent the country and they should never be taken for granted.’ The 33-year-old manages to stay positive due to his great passion for the game and his awareness that it is just that – a game. ‘It’s just a game, the friendships are bigger than cricket,’ said Clarke. ‘I’ve always loved cricket since I was just seven years old. But I’m aware that it’s not my job, it’s my hobby.’ ‘Whatever happens, I will play as long as I can, whether I’m lucky enough to play for my country or my state or in club cricket.’ With no Ashes series this Australian summer, Clarke is encouraging Aussies to brush up on their oral health by taking part in the two week True Blue Challenge, or as he is calling it: 'The Gnashes' Take the True Blue Challenge by heading to Oral-B's 'Rob the Dentist' Facebook page to get behind your oral health and that of the nation. Everyone who takes part will be in the draw to win a backyard cricket match with Michael Clarke . Clarke opened up about another moment in his career which served as a stark reminder to value the people in the game, rather than obsess over the competition. ‘I have learnt a lot about myself and about the game in the last eight weeks,’ he said. ‘But I remember in 2007 when I was playing in the World Cup in the West Indies and my mum called me to tell me that my dad had been diagnosed with cancer.’ ‘My attitude towards cricket actually changed back then, straight away.’ ‘What we’ve been going through during the last eight weeks (since Hughes died) has been similar. Clarke says he maintains a positive attitude by focussing on how fortunate he is and by cherishing the friendships he makes along the way. ‘I am passionate about playing the game together with other people and meeting people. ‘I value my family and friends and I know that cricket is just a game.’ He is looking forward to having cricket in his life in the future and hopes that involves plenty more Test matches for Australia. ‘I love the game. I’ve been lucky in my career to not have had many injuries – one of the lucky few!’ ‘This was my first surgery and I am thankful that my body has held up as long as it has.’ Rather than feel frustrated by his struggle with his injuries, Clarke says he is grateful for the lengthy and illustrious career he has already enjoyed. ‘I am thankful; the game has given me so much. I owe the game, it doesn’t owe me.’ ‘What will be will be and until then I will concentrate on doing everything I possibly can.’ Rather than feel frustrated by his struggle with his injuries, Clarke says he is grateful for the lengthy and illustrious career he has already enjoyed .","Michael Clarke told Daily Mail Australia that 'Phillip Hughes is what gets me out of bed every morning'

"Fighting tooth and nail to stay ahead of the competition, 63-year-old California dentist allegedly has set fire to the offices of his rivals. Dr Leopold Weinstein, from Moorpark, was arrested Friday on three counts of arson, three additional counts of attempted arson and possession of a silencer, according to the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office. Weinstein's arrest was the culmination of a seven-month investigation into a spate of fires at dental offices beginning last June. Dog-eat-dog world: Dr Leopold Weinstein (left and right), 63, a dentist from California, has been charged with arson and attempted arson targeting the practices of his competitors . Ruthless competition: Weinstein, who graduated back in 1978, has a practice at Spanish Hill Dental Group in Camarillo (pictured) - an area that is home to several other dental offices . Weinstein, a native of Cleveland who has been practicing dentistry for more than 35 years, was taken into custody after a surveillance camera caught him allegedly torching a dental office January 28. The sheriff's office launched an investigation at the same building in Camarillo seven months earlier when large quantities of flammable liquid were discovered on the roof. Less than two weeks later, another building housing a dental office was damaged in an arson fire. Suspicion fell on Dr Weinstein, who has a practice at Spanish Hill Dental Group in Camarillo, after a Good Samaritan took a picture of a car parked next to one of the torched buildings in the off hours. Law enforcement officials were able to determine that a vehicle matching the same description had been spotted outside other area dental offices stricken by arson. Long in the tooth: The middle-aged dentist was allegedly motivated by greed . Taking a page out of Mafia's playbook, Dr Weinstein allegedly returned to the scene of the original arson last Wednesday to finish the job, at which point he was apprehended by police. Detectives believe Weinstein, who counts among his patients a former contestant on the reality show Survivor: Borneo, was motivated by greed. Weinstein is being held on $250,000 bail. He is due in court Tuesday. According to his profile on Spanish Hills Dental Group's website, Weintein, who goes by the trademarked moniker 'Dr Leo,' is a 'Christian professional' who has been active in the Boy Scouts of America and the Salvation Army.","Dr Leopold Weinstein, 63, from California, charged with arson and attempted arson .

"When beautician Katie Cutler set up a fundraising page for Alan Barnes she hoped to raise a respectable £500 to help the disabled pensioner feel safer in his home after he was mugged and left with a broken collarbone as he put the bins out. But the 21-year-old never expected to inspire people from as far afield as New Zealand and Canada to donate in their droves so that the money would be enough to buy Mr Barnes a new house. As donations exceeded £300,000 in just four days people are calling for Miss Cutler herself to be rewarded for her philanthropic attitude. Scroll down for video . Katie Cutler set up a fundraising page for mugging victim Alan Barnes, which raised more than £300,000 - well wishers have launched a campaign to raise money for Miss Cutler and calling for her to be awarded an OBE . Miss Cutler had an emotional first meeting with Mr Barnes on Sunday and insists she does not need rewards . A Facebook page has been set up praising her efforts and calling for her to be awarded an OBE. A separate fundraising campaign has also been launched for her, which has so far raised £500 - despite the mother-of-one insisting she does not want the money. Police have also renewed their efforts and appealed for information to help find the thug who carried out the 'cowardly' attack on the pensioner, outside his Gateshead home at about 6.30pm last Sunday. Detective Constable Chris Barnes said the assault had left the 67-year-old feeling vulnerable, but he had been boosted by the support of people who had donated to help him. He said: 'But the main thing for us is to find the person responsible for this cowardly assault against a man unable to defend himself and we need the public's help. 'We do not have a description or direction of travel of the offender but someone will know something about the man involved.' DC Barnes said they had some forensic evidence but little information about the culprit. Donations to the Alan Barnes fund, through website gofundme, tipped £300,000 this afternoon and pledges are still being made almost every minute. Mr Barnes plans to use the money raised by Miss Cutler's fundraising page to buy himself a new house . Catherine Kirkley, of Northumberland, has launched the fundraising page for 21-year-old Miss Cutler. She said: 'I have never met Katie Cutler but I felt touched by her efforts, as a mother of an autistic child who has experienced bullying and violence I feel we need to make a stand. All funds will be handed to Katie via PayPal in order for her to spend as she wishes.' Wellwishers left comments on the new funding page, showing their support for Miss Cutler. Thousands of people from across the globe have donated and in four days the fund has exceeded £300,000 . Mr Barnes said the selfless act by Miss Cutler and other people who had donated had restored his faith . Doug Roberts said: 'Katie, you will go far in life with your selfless attitude. You've become something of a celebrity, and the Alan Barnes fund is gonna be something in your CV that people will always remember you for. 'In your wildest dreams, you could never have imagined last week, that by now you'd have raised enough to buy Alan a home outright! True serendipity, and a story that's taken the world by it's heartstrings.' There is also a Facebook campaign for the generous mother to be awarded an OBE to honour her fundraising efforts. A page called 'Katie Cutler For An OBE' already has more than 230 members. Diane Bore posted: 'I wish this gentleman could live next door to Katie someone who has shown him so much love and support the world needs more people like her in it.' Tracy Roberts wrote: 'How about something like the Alan Barnes foundation. We call all take Katie's lead and help others. Also show those hideous types of people they won't win. Just an idea.' Under the Go Fund Me rules, Miss Cutler and Mr Barnes can request access to the funds which have been donated at any time, and it will be paid to them within a week. Some supporters have called for the website to waive its five per cent fee on the donations - set to add up to at least £14,000. Miss Cutler and Mr Barnes have spoken of their amazement at the reaction to the fundraising appeal . However the organisation said it would not be able to waive its fees in this case. A spokeswoman said: 'As you might imagine, we receive many requests to waive fees, along with other concessions. In order to be fair, if we waive fees for one cause, we're obligated to also waive fees for others. 'Unfortunately, if we began waiving fees on a regular basis, there would be no way for us to build and maintain the website. Simply put, there would be no GoFundMe. 'Our hearts go out to Alan Barnes and his family during this difficult time. The campaign set up for Alan is a shining example of what can happen when GoFundMe is used to its full potential. The campaign has been shared on Facebook a staggering 25,000 times, and on Twitter nearly 3,000 times.' As donations tipped £300,000 Miss Cutler said she was pleased so many people had donated to help Mr Barnes but said she felt she did not deserve any recognition or fundraising for herself. 'This is so incredibly kind but I really can't accept anything,' she said. 'I have my full life to work and I can't help but feel that there are people out there who would really need it. I'm not in any hurry to get married too but honestly I don't deserve this.' Miss Cutler and Mr Barnes had an emotional first meeting for the first time yesterday, at his sister's house in Newcastle on Tyne where he is staying because he is too afraid to return home. The pensioner described meeting Miss Cutler as 'absolutely magic.' Mr Barnes, who measures just 4ft 6ins tall, is disabled and suffers from sight problems. He has been disabled since he was born after his mother contracted German measles while hse was pregnant. He had been putting the bins out when a man approached him, demanded money and then knocked him to the floor and rifled through his pockets. Mr Barnes has been staying with his sister and her family since the attack - including his niece Georgi Galloway and great niece Florence Purvis . Finding nothing the man fled, leaving Mr Barnes on the concrete. The 67-year-old hauled himself to his neighbour's house and managed to phone his sister, and was taken to hospital. Miss Cutler's fundraising efforts have not only led to scores of donations, but people have also offered to work for free to help Mr Barnes and fit out his new house. Mr Barnes told BBC Breakfast: 'A solicitor from Gosforth has offered advice and I will just have to take it from there, but it will be put to good use.' And Miss Cutler added: 'A full kitchen has been offered, a conservatory, a bathroom. There's an electrician, a tiler - you name it ... everything.' Mr Barnes, who is an excellent mathematician and popular with young people in the area, has promised to put the funds raised to good use and not splash out on luxury items. Police are asking anyone who lives in Hillside Place who may have CCTV to check footage for clues about the attacker. Witnesses are asked to contact police on 101, ext 69191, quoting log number 1180 25/01/15, or the Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Alan Barnes is disabled and suffers from sight and growth problems .

"Genetic evidence suggests that bed bugs originated in bats. The new study comes as the number of bed bug infestations continues to rise and their resistance to insecticide is increasingly becoming a public health concern. It is the first research to find genetic evidence for 'bat bugs' and bed bugs being linked. University of Tulsa in Oklahoma scientists studied origin of bed bugs (stock image of Cimex lectularius shown). They found the first genetic evidence that bats are their origin. Research suggests human contact with bats in caves thousands of years ago led to them becoming a modern pest . When they bite, bed bugs inject tiny amounts of blood thinning and anaesthetic agents into their victim, triggering an immune response in humans. In most cases, and if they are left alone, the bites calm down and disappear over the course of a week to ten days. However, in some cases the person bitten has a bulbous reaction to the bite - this is when the skin erupts into pus-filled blisters. While bed bugs are not known to carry diseases, doctors say there is still a question over whether they can transmit hepatitis B or C, although there are no proven cases. The study was carried out by scientists from the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma, reported the BBC. Experts looked at hundreds of bed bugs from human and bat dwellings across 13 different countries. One in particular, Cimex lectularius, is useful for studying genetic diversity as it is a wingless insect, and therefore has relatively limited mobility. Their findings suggest that all bed bugs ultimately had a similar origin. It is thought that, as humans moved from Africa to Eurasia thousands of years ago, bed bugs would likely have sought both bat and human hosts in shared caves throughout Eurasia. In addition, the researchers also found evidence for two predominant lineages in Europe that are so diverse, they are almost different species. In September 2014, a DNA study at Sheffield University showed that just one pregnant bed bug can cause an infestation. The pregnant bed bug could rapidly create a colony of thousands of offspring that feed on humans. Bed bugs' ability to generate a new colony from such small numbers might be a 'clue to their recent success. It is thought that, as humans expanded from Africa to Eurasia thousands of years ago, bed bugs would likely have sought both bat  and human hosts in shared caves throughout Eurasia (stock image shown) During the day bed bugs lurk in the seams of mattresses (stock image shown), cracks in furniture, behind skirting boards and in crevices in the walls - coming out at night to feed on your blood. They go for exposed areas of the body such as the legs and arms - they don't tend to bother burrowing through clothing . In the late 1880s, an estimated 75 per cent of households were affected, but by the outbreak of World War II, that figure had dwindled to 25 per cent. Their recent resurgence has been blamed by some experts on resistance to commonly used insecticides and the increase in international travel. Bed bugs spread on clothes, bags and in furniture when it is moved - 'anywhere that people exist, particularly where they sit or lie down', according to bed-bug extermination expert David Cain. They are wingless, rust coloured insects about the size of an apple pip. During the day they lurk in the seams of mattresses, cracks in furniture, behind skirting boards and in crevices in the walls - coming out at night to feed on your blood. They target exposed areas of the body such as the legs and arms  and do not tend to burrow through clothing.","University of Tulsa in Oklahoma scientists studied origin of bed bugs .

The pair are believed to have swapped notes on government spending and assessing their progress since meeting in 2011 - before dining with members of Cameron's cabinet. The discussions came on the second day of Christie's three-day visit to the UK capital in a move that could strengthen his foreign policy credentials ahead of the 2016 presidential election. He kicked off the trip with an English Premier League soccer match to see Arsenal beat David Cameron's team of choice Aston Villa with a final score 5-0. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Meeting: Chris Christie met with David Cameron on Monday night to discuss government spending . No hard feelings? It came a day after he backed the soccer team that slaughtered Cameron's home squad . Sporting red and white, Arsenal's colors, he was seen cheering from a corporate box alongside his wife Mary. Despite missing the Super Bowl, Mr and Mrs Christie told reporters they didn't mind and that they would catch it at on re-runs. The UK is the third largest foreign trading partner for New Jersey after Canada and Mexico, and the trip will focus on pursuing new opportunities for growth between UK and New Jersey. 'One of the main objectives for the trip is to focus on the opportunities that exist between the UK and New Jersey and our country as a whole,' said Christie.

"Street cleaning budgets have been slashed in many parts of the country, fuelling fears about the worsening blight of litter. In some local authorities, spending on clearing rubbish is down by more than 80 per cent, figures out today show. Freedom of information requests to all 326 councils in England show there has been a 16 per cent cut overall in real terms since 2010. Scroll down for video . In some local authorities, spending on clearing rubbish is down by more than 80 per cent, figures have shown . In the worst-affected regions, spending on keeping streets clean has dropped by almost a third. Some individual councils, however, have cut budgets by more than 80 per cent. Last week, a report suggested that living in a neighbourhood scattered with rubbish can hit property prices by almost 12 per cent. The study also indicated a link between high levels of litter and crime. The survey of councils was conducted by Hilary Benn, shadow communities and local government secretary. He said: 'Clean streets help to engender a sense of civic pride but this is being undermined by reductions to the very frontline services that David Cameron said he would protect. 'Labour would devolve power and money to local areas and work with them to find savings through collaboration, allowing them to protect the frontline services residents expect and rely on.' Last week, a report suggested that living in a neighbourhood scattered with rubbish can hit property prices by almost 12 per cent . Today, Labour will promise to carry out the biggest devolution of economic power and funding to English city and county regions for generations if it returns to power in May. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will set out plans to devolve £30billion over five years, including funding for housing, transport, business support, employment and adult skills. The party would also allow city and county regions which unite in combined authorities to keep 100 per cent of extra business rates revenue generated by additional growth. Today's survey of local authorities shows that the deepest cuts in street cleaning budgets have been in the West Midlands, which has seen a 30 per cent real terms drop since 2010. Second was the South West, with spending down 28 per cent followed by the North East, where the cut was 27 per cent. The South East had the smallest reduction – 6 per cent – while spending in the East of England, was down 9 per cent. Freedom of information requests to all 326 councils in England show there has been a 16 per cent cut overall in real terms since 2010 . The Keep Britain Tidy campaign said suburban homes with a litter problem could be worth 2.7 per cent to 11.8 per cent less than they otherwise would be. The average home in England and Wales is worth £176,581 so a serious litter problem could take £20,837 off the value. For a £500,000 property, the loss in value could be £58,823. Overflowing wheelie bins on pavements outside houses can also affect the value of properties, according to the research. Tim Burns, from Keep Britain Tidy, said: 'When people are looking to buy a home, they want to feel they are buying in a nice place, where the community is cared for. 'There's a lot of evidence to show in a more littered environment, people are less helpful to each other. Crime breeds litter and it might be that litter breeds crime. The knock-on is people don't want to move there and prices are reduced. If you clean up the neighbourhood, it can improve your bank balance.'","There has been a 16 per cent cut overall in real terms in England since 2010 .

The mother, from Leyland, Lancashire, has even set up a Facebook and Twitter account to further her cause - but prefers to keep her identity a secret, even from her own husband. Mystery mother: Spreading goodwill in her hometown of Leyland, Lancashire, a mother-of-two leaves an envelope containing money to pay for a coffee in a postbox outside a cafe . She said: 'I've only told one friend, and that was to see what she thought and to help me come up with ideas. 'I want to remain anonymous - I'm not interested in any glory, I just hope people enjoy it and it inspires others. 'I read about other people doing it elsewhere in the country and I thought why not do it in my local town? 'I don't have lots of money, I'm keeping it to simple things, but it's a nice thing that people aren't expecting. Random act of kindness: An unused scratchcard id left on a shelf in supermarket for a stranger to pick up . She has launched a Facebook and Twitter page called Leyland RAOK (Random Acts of Kindness) - where details of her good deeds are posted. Her hope is that she will inspire others by her charitable behaviour - ahead of National Random Acts of Kindness week, which starts on Monday. Speaking about one of the deed, she added: 'We felt very conspicuous doing it. In the supermarket I made sure I had a bit of shopping with me and that no-one else was down the aisle, but it felt strange getting things out. 'But then I thought that people mess about on their phones and with shopping lists all the time. Then at the car park I had no idea how much parking cost. I had an envelope and I had to pretend I was looking at the charges. Spreading goodwill: Her good deeds include leaving an envelope of cash attached to a parking meter . Another envelope containing an unused scratchcard is pinned to a tree for a lucky stranger to discover . 'I waited till it was quiet and nobody was looking, then I went and stuck the envelope on the machine. Then I realised I'd forgot to put the money in. Imagine how bad that would have looked!' The mystery woman added: 'I'm enjoying it and it's nice to get feedback, but people are bound to be suspicious. 'I saw a lady go up to the parking meter, look at the envelope and not open it. I'd probably be the same though, wondering what was going on. 'But people should be on the look out, I'm aiming to do this long-term with a few things every week. The hardest part will be coming up with ideas.' Social media account: The mystery woman has set up a Facebook and Twitter account called Leyland  RAOK (Random Acts of Kindness) Her kindness is already rubbing off on others - as she discovered after leaving money to pay for a meal inside a postbox outside the Cowshed cafe in Buckshaw Village, Lancashire. Kerry Booth, manager of The Cowshed, was handed the envelope to pay for the next customer's order. 'We thought it was absolutely wonderful and we were very pleased to be able to pass the envelope on to two ladies who came in,' said Ms Booth. The cafe manager then decided to carry out her own act of kindness by donating the money to a children's hospice. Last week, another random act of kindness hit the spotlight after a passenger on a train left a heart-warming letter and £5 note to a young mother after being moved by her parenting skills. Ken Saunders, 50, said he felt compelled to write the message praising single mother Samantha Welch as a ‘credit to her generation’, after watching her look after her three-year-old son Rylan.

"A mother bit off the end of a sex attacker’s tongue as he subjected her to a terrifying assault so that he could be brought to justice. Adele Barber, 29, was grabbed by the man as she walked along a deserted alleyway near her home. When he groped her and tried to kiss her, she bravely fought back and sank her teeth into his tongue. Scroll down for video . Adele Barber, 29, was attacked by a mentally unstable man who she fought off by biting his tongue . The alleyway in Dunstable where the attack took place in daylight as Adele walked home from the doctors . Although it didn’t stop him – he even seemed to take a perverse enjoyment from the pain – it provided vital DNA for police to analyse when she managed to escape. Two months later they arrested Ferdinand Manila, 28. It emerged that he had attacked a 55-year-old woman minutes after his assault on Mrs Barber. He has now been given an indefinite hospital order after being found guilty of three counts of sexual assault. A court ruled he didn’t have the mental capacity to enter a plea. Mrs Barber – who lost a rape case against another man ten years earlier – told ITV’s This Morning yesterday: ‘After the first assault I was a mess. I was really young and naïve and didn’t go to police straight away so they didn’t have enough evidence. ‘That made me more determined this time. I thought “I’ve got to get evidence and show this is not consensual. No one is going to do this to me again. I’m going to make sure this person gets the treatment they need”.’ The mother-of-three waived her right to anonymity yesterday to urge other sex assault victims to do all they can to help convict their attacker. Ferdinand Manila, 28, was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault . ‘Your body can freeze but, if you can, fight back and get evidence,’ she said. Mrs Barber was attacked in daylight as she walked home from a doctor’s appointment in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, in January last year. Manila brushed past her in the alleyway and moments later ran back towards her, pushing her up against a wall where he assaulted her. Despite the danger she faced, she had the presence of mind to realise he was ‘vulnerable’ as soon as he forced his tongue inside her mouth. ‘I wanted to get DNA and cause pain to get him off me. I didn’t think I would bite off his tongue, I thought I would just get his DNA on my teeth,’ she said. 'When I bit him and caused him pain, he enjoyed it. I knew then that something wasn’t quite right but I was relentless and got him off me.’ She ran a mile home with the piece of flesh in her mouth and immediately rang the police before explaining to her husband Paul, a laboratory technician, what had happened. Officers advised her to place it in a sterile pot and were able to match it to Manila when he was caught in March. He was convicted of two offences against Mrs Barber and another against the other victim when he appeared at Luton Crown Court on January 21. Adele urged victims of sexually assault to contact police straight away . The court heard he had been held in a psychiatric hospital where staff reported he made sexual comments to female employees and fantasised about peeling the skin off people. Judge Barbara Mensah commended Mrs Barber’s bravery, saying: ‘His first victim took a big risk when she bit off part of Mr Manila’s tongue. This was very distressing for her.’ Mrs Barber had a conditional place on a university course to study midwifery but lost it after taking time off to deal with the trauma of her ordeal. She has also been left anxious to leave home. Despite the terrible impact on her life, she has expressed her hope her attacker would get well. ‘Hopefully he can get the treatment he needs and then get out and start his life again,’ she added. Around 85,000 women are raped and 400,000 sexually assaulted every year in England and Wales, according to official figures. More than a quarter fail to report the attack.","Adele Barber, 29, from Dunstable, appeared on This Morning .

"When you've exhausted your options on Happn, and swiped left on any potential soulmate on Tinder, where do you turn? Well, you might want to think about flirting with your opponents on a gaming app. Which is exactly what students Maria Jernslett, 22, and Erlend Finboe Svendsen did. The lovebirds met on the word game Ruzzle, where you compete with other users to find the highest score of correct words. Maria and Erlend met on the word puzzle app Ruzzle, they started dating in 2013 and now plan to marry . Maria and Erlend have enjoyed several holidays today travelling to Spain for a holiday . The couple first started talking in 2012 when they both pressed the option to play with a 'random player' at the exact same time and were pitted against each other. Then after two months of playing the game Erlend decided to drop Maria a message. Maria explained: 'I guess you can say we were at the right place at the right time. Initially, Erlend out-performed me consistently, but I was up for a challenge. 'After a couple of months of playing Ruzzle, I finally won and he decided to send me a message saying ""take it easy"". The couple, pictured here in Paris, are planning on moving in with one another in London later this year . Maria has revealed the couple's families thing that they are perfect for one another and should get married . Maria and Erlend are both from Norway originally but now live in the UK. While she studies in London, he is doing an MSc in Finance at Durham University. The message Erlend sent initiated a  conversation between them - chatting about the everything from the game to their personal lives. Maria said: 'Both of us found comfort in the fact that we could talk openly about things to a complete stranger, and that the other person did not know anything except from the nickname in Ruzzle. 'We intended to meet each other for a long time, but it we had become addicted to texting, and that we actually started to miss each other even though we constantly chatted.' Erlend and Maria met on the word game app Ruzzle playing against each other for a couple of months before eventually getting in contact . Maria said it was easier for her and Erlend to talk to one another about their problems over the app . 'In the summer of 2013, Erlend was invited by a friend from his former university to go for a festival in the southern part of Norway, which is was close to my hometown. 'So we decided to meet. Without exaggerating, it was love at first sight. We stayed up the entire night and just kept talking. We have been a couple since that day.' Throughout their relationship they have been separated and lived in different towns. But the couple are already planning to move in with one another in May  and get married. And they've already enjoyed some pretty special holidays, travelling  to Spain and Paris together.

"A couple who who were asked to leave an Iceland store because their seven-year-old autistic son was 'out of control' claim they have been discriminated against. Matthew Lawton was shopping with his wife Amanda, 38, and his son Bradley at an Iceland store in Sheffield, when he claims a security guard asked them to leave. Mr Lawton claims his autistic son had been putting his hands in the freezers and was running up and down the aisles in the store. Iceland contends Bradley was potentially endangering himself and other customers 'by striking the lids of freezer cabinets while wearing a heavy ring'. Matthew Lawton, pictured with his wife Amanda and his son Bradley, seven, have claimed 'discrimination' after they were asked to leave an Iceland store in Sheffield because their son, who has autism, was running around the store and putting his hands in freezers; the family has been given a £20 voucher from Iceland . The Iceland store in The Moor, Sheffield, where the Lawton family was asked to leave by store security . The 40-year-old claims the security guard at the store on The Moor, accused him of not being able to control Bradley. He said: 'I am absolutely furious. He wasn't in a bad meltdown, but to be told you can't control your son is absolutely disgraceful. I couldn't believe it.' Mr Lawton said he explained to the security guard that his son had autism, and later called Iceland's head office to complain.The store sent him a £20 voucher. Mr Lawton said: 'I want to use the incident to raise awareness of disabled discrimination. 'Because Bradley doesn't need a wheelchair, people sometimes don't realise his condition. 'I'm very passionate about the fact that awareness isn't there and often it's the older generation that frown or don't seem to understand.' Mr Lawton said his family had suffered 'discrimination'. Iceland has said that it is investigating the incident and will take 'any action that may be appropriate'; pictured above is The Moor Market, where the Iceland store is located . He said: 'When you have someone in that job, you have to have an awareness about what you can and can't say. It's discrimination. 'I think we're a little bit behind in this country.' A spokesman for Iceland said the company is 'opposed to all forms of discrimination'. 'We are well aware of, and sympathetic to, the issues faced by the parents of autistic children and we try our utmost to make allowances for sometimes challenging behaviour in store. However, we must also have regard for the safety of our other customers and staff.' The spokesman said a security guard approached the Lawtons and asked them 'to calm' Bradley down and warned they they would have to leave the store if they couldn't. Iceland gave the family a £20 voucher, the spokesman said, as a 'gesture of goodwill'. 'We offered them as a gesture of goodwill and have already returned to shop in the same store, and we hope to see them and their son in store many times again in the future.' Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that affects social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour. It includes Asperger syndrome and childhood autism. Children with ASD can display challenging behaviour, which can sometimes appear physically aggressive. The condition can also include behaviours like pica (putting inedible things in the mouth) and repetitive hand flapping, tapping or twisting. The world can be a confusing, isolating and daunting place for a child with autism and it is their difficulties with communication and social interaction that are often the root cause of difficult behaviour. The child's behaviour is not caused by bad parenting, the National Autistic Society says. Because of these difficulties, children can find it hard to communicate their needs or to understand what other people are saying to them, or asking them to do. Children with an ASD may not understand 'social rules' - the unwritten rules that govern social situations, such as how loud or quiet they must be, what behaviour is appropriate in public places, how close to stand to other people or how to take a turn in conversation. This is especially true if children find themselves in a new, unfamiliar situation. Therefore, social situations or new situations can be daunting and unpredictable. This can cause considerable frustration and anxiety which, if it can't be expressed any other way may result in challenging behaviour.

"Death by firing squad for a British grandmother now seems certain after Indonesia today revealed two Australian men will be among the next group of death row inmates to be executed. Lindsay Sandiford, 57, from Cheltenham, has been languishing on death row in Bali since being convicted of attempting to smuggle £1.6million of cocaine through the island's airport in 2012. She maintains she was forced to transport the drugs to protect her children, whose safety was at stake. Scroll down for video . Death by firing squad for British grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, 57, (pictured) now seems inevitable . Ms Sandiford has been languishing on death row since being convicted of drugs smuggling in 2012 . She has written a desperate letter to Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who will visit Indonesia this month . Since her arrest, she has been holed up in the squalid Kerobokan prison in Bali. She claims to have received little or no help from the Foreign Office since then and fears the Indonesian authorities might construe that as a lack of commitment by the government to her cause. Revelations of an affair between fellow inmate Julian Ponder - nicknamed Bali's Mr Big - and Alys Harahap, Britain's top diplomat in Bali have also handicapped her efforts to evade the firing squad. Ms Harahap stopped her visits to Kerobokan prison after the affair was exposed, meaning Ms Sandiford may have been denied the full diplomatic support to which she is entitled. Ms Sandiford has now written a desperate letter to Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who is due to visit Indonesia this month. She has pleaded for funding to pay for a lawyer in the hope of escaping the firing squad - but today's grim news that two Australians will be among the next to die has dramatically weakened her hopes. Australian pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran (above) are scheduled for the next round of executions . Sukumaran and Chan (above) are on a list of 26 prisoners Indonesia says will be executed in the 'next round' Indonesia's Attorney-General H.H.Prasetyo confirmed today that Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, condemned ringleaders of the Bali Nine heroin-smuggling group, will die with other condemned prisoners soon. It was not clear when exactly the executions will take place. Appeals for clemency have already been rejected. The pair will face execution together for their plot to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin in to Australia. Mr Prasetyo told a press conference today: 'We have heard that many Australians support the execution and it is one of the things that pushes us to feel we are not making a mistake.' Lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran, who have been on death row since 2006, have filed an application for a second judicial review. Mr Prasetyo said he had heard this focused on the men's rehabilitation in prison, but said this did not constitute new evidence. If the execution goes ahead, Sandiford would be transferred to a maximum security jail on Nusa Kambangan . There are seven prisons located on Bali's execution island, which is situated off Java Island . Nusa Kambangan is known as the island where condemned men and women come to die (pictured) The members of the Bali Nine were arrested in 2005 on charges of a plot to smuggle heroin into Australia . If her execution goes ahead, Sandiford would be transferred from Bali to a maximum security jail on Nusa Kambangan, off Java Island, for up 72 hours before facing the firing squad. The island is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago. The last round of executions took place shortly after midnight. Executions are carried out by 12-man firing squads – only a proportion of whom are given live bullets. In their last 72 hours, prisoners are granted final requests and allowed to spend time with family and friends as they see out their last hours in isolation cells. Prisoners are offered blindfolds to wear and are given the choice to stand, sit or lie down when the firing squad carries out their execution from between five and 10 metres. Since her arrest in 2012, Ms Sandiford has been holed up in the squalid Kerobokan prison in Bali (pictured) The Foreign Office said it stood 'ready to provide support at this difficult time, if requested'. It said it had consistently provided and offered consular support to Ms Sandiford, which she currently declined to accept. 'We are closely following Lindsay Sandiford's case in Indonesia. We stand ready to provide support at this difficult time, if it is requested,' said a spokesman in the British embassy in the Indonesian capital Jakarta. 'The UK strongly opposes the death penalty in all circumstances without exception. We have made representations about the death penalty to the Indonesian government, and we will continue to do so.' Indonesia has some of the toughest drug laws in the world. It ended a four-year moratorium on executions in 2013. Last month, Indonesia executed convicts from Malawi, Nigeria, Vietnam, Brazil and the Netherlands as well as one from Indonesia.","Lindsay Sandiford, 57, of Cheltenham, has been on death row since 2012 .

"Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-ah could face three years in prison for her notorious 'nut rage' incident after which she was accused of treating staff as 'feudal slaves'. The 40-year-old, who had an in-flight tantrum over how she was served macadamia nuts in December before take off at New York City's JFK airport, defended her actions citing her devotion to work during the final day of testimony today. The daughter of Korean Air's chairman has been in custody since December 30 and was charged with forcing a flight to change its normal route and which carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. She also faces three other charges including the use of violence against flight crew, hindering a government probe and forcing the flight's purser off the plane. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. However, the South Korean prosecutors' recommendation of three years in prison comes after they said Cho led the airline's systematic efforts to cover up the incident, compelled employees to lie to government investigators and discredited and blamed the chief flight attendant. Scroll down for video . Prosecutors recommended three years in prison for Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-ah (above) for her notorious 'nut rage' incident that caused an uproar in South Korea . Cho, the daughter of Korean Air's chairman, defended her actions as the result of devotion to work. Pictured above, a bus carrying Cho arrived for the final day of testimony at the Seoul Western District Court in Seoul today . She backed up her actions and said that cabin crew in first class had made a mistake by not following proper procedures, Seoul Western District Court heard. During the incident which occurred on December 5, Park Chang-jin, the chief flight attendant, was ordered off the plane by angry Cho, following a heated confrontation with cabin crew because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a dish. Furious that he had not followed protocol, she screamed at Park and told him to bring out the company’s in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines. When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him off the flight. Without giving the 250 passengers on board a warning, the Incheon-bound plane was forced to return to the gate at John F Kennedy Airport in New York. The Airbus A380 eventually arrived in South Korea 11 minutes late. In court, Park said he and other staff were treated like 'feudal slaves' by the heiress. Park Chang-jin (left), the chief flight attendant ordered off the flight by angry Cho, told the court he and other staff were treated like 'feudal slaves' by the heiress. Her father and airline chairman Cho Yang-ho (right) called her behaviour 'foolish' and said that he regretted that he did not raise her better . Cho, who has been in custody since December 30, made a grovelling apology (above) where she bowed her head in shame and said she was 'sorry' following the incident . And a statement from one crew member described Cho as behaving like an 'angry tiger' during the incident. Cho did admit to using violence against one flight attendant by pushing her shoulder and throwing an object at her. She also said she did not realize the chief flight attendant has law enforcement authority during the flight and that by ordering the chief flight attendant off the plane was consequently a risk to safety. The 'final call' about returning to the gate was made by the captain, said Cho. 'I think this case happened because of devotion to my work and because I could not be considerate to other people,' she said. The 40-year-old's 'nut rage' tantrum caused an uproar in South Korea where the economy is dominated by family-run conglomerates known as 'chaebol' that often act above the law. She resigned from her role as executive vice president . Her 'nut rage' tantrum also caused an uproar in South Korea where the economy is dominated by family-run conglomerates known as 'chaebol' that often act above the law. Macadamia nut sales rose following Cho Hyun-ah's 'nut rage' tantrum. Auction, a South Korean unit of eBay and South Korea's second-largest e-commerce website, said last December that sales of macadamias surged nearly 12-fold without any promotions. It also said macadamias previously made up five per cent of its nut sales but said (at the time) they were accounting for almost half. Last week, cabin crew told the court they were pressured by Korean Air executives to cover up the incident and to lie to investigators. Prosecutors said they are seeking a two-year prison sentence for Yeo Woon-jin, the Korean Air executive accused of pressuring cabin crew to cover up the incident and to lie to investigators from South Korea's transport ministry. They also called for two years in prison for Kim Woon-sub, a transport ministry official and former Korean Air executive accused of leaking secrets about the ministry's investigation. Following the incident last December, Cho made a grovelling apology where she bowed her head in shame and admitted in a trembling voice that she was 'sorry'. Adding to her humiliation, her father and airline chairman Cho Yang-ho called her behavior 'foolish' and said that he regretted that he did not raise her better. He added that his eldest child would resign from her role as executive vice president and executive roles at all affiliates of Hanjin, the group that controls Korean Air. Cho's lawyers have not disputed the major elements of the prosecutor's account of events, and instead have focused on a technical rebuttal of the charges. This has included trying to demonstrate flight attendants did not know proper service procedures. On the most serious charge of changing a flight's route, they argued events fell short of that definition because the plane was only meters from the gate when it turned around. The three trial judges are expected to announce their verdicts before Lunar New Year holidays this month.","Cho Hyun-ah ordered flight's purser Park Chang-jin off plane last December after she was served nuts in bag instead of on a dish .

"He may have officially withdrawn from the Queensland election but Jason Deller has somehow still managed to get 222 people to vote for him in the Kawana district. But Daily Mail Australia understands that police from the Child Protection Investigation Unit on the Sunshine Coast have opened a case following the incident in a suburban cafe, with charges still on the cards. It's also believed the matter is likely to be referred to the Department of Communities and Child Safety. The confronting CCTV footage shows Mr Deller pouring water from a jug over his baby boy's head and then slap his toddler son across the front of the head, before pulling the baby out of the high chair and storming out of the eatery. Scroll down for videos . The one-time Queensland Independent candidate can be clearly viewed on CCTV raising his hand to slap his toddler son across the head . The force of the blow leads to the child losing his balance and sliding from the table . The father-of-four was earlier caught on camera pouring cold water from a jug on his baby son's head at a cafe. The incident is being investigated by Queensland Police Child Protection Investigation Unit . One of Mr Deller's corflutes is pictured having been pushed over ahead of the election last Saturday. Outgoing Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie has retained the seat of Kawana for the LNP . The father-of-four and award-winning engineer eventually succumbed to the intense public pressure and announced he would withdraw from Saturday's ballot, saying 'I am completely devastated about how the event has been presented in public'. However, according to the latest figures from Electoral Commission Queensland, in a field of six listed candidates, Mr Deller has managed to attract the support of 222 first-preference votes, just under 1 per cent. Incumbent Jarrod Bleijie, the outgoing Attorney-General, has retained the seat for the LNP. Despite suggestions to the contrary, Queensland Police have not ruled out laying charges against the one-time political aspirant. Surveillance video from inside the cafe shows the Engineering Your Life founder casually walking over to his infant son sitting in a high chair and pouring cold water from the jug all over the small baby. While Mr Deller walks away to put the jug back - his toddler son, who is standing on his chair, begins to climb on the table before pouring out his drink from a cup onto the floor. His father witnesses the behaviour and walks over to the young boy and swiftly smacks him across the head, so hard that the stunned youngster slides down off the table. Mr Deller pulls then proceeds to pull his baby son out of the high chair and walk out of the cafe. 'Unfortunately I reacted inappropriately and gave him a clip over his ear. I sincerely apologise to my son, and wife and to those who witnessed this incident,' Mr Deller said before withdrawing from the election . Despite being caught out smacking his child in public and dropping out of the election on Friday, Mr Deller received 222 votes at the Saturday poll . A diner recognised the aspiring politician and called the police who have questioned Mr Deller but, as yet, no charges have been laid. His wife, who is seated at the table throughout the entire incident, finishes her meal before picking up her toddler son to follow her husband out of the cafe, much to the astonishment of the other diners. A diner recognised the aspiring politician and called the police, who have questioned Mr Deller but, as yet, no charges have been laid. Mr Deller stood down on Friday afternoon, reading from a written statement, he said: 'Last Sunday whilst having breakfast with my wife and family at a café in Buddina on the Sunshine Coast, a series of very challenging events led me to become frustrated and upset with the behaviour of my three year old son.' 'Unfortunately I reacted inappropriately and gave him a clip over his ear. I sincerely apologise to my son, and wife and to those who witnessed this incident. 'The incident was part of a series of a very challenging events which we had to deal with on Sunday morning, not unlike any other day with a child who has behavioural issues.' He went on to say: 'As many parents know, it is sometimes very hard to discuss these issues outside of friends and existing support services that we confidentially engage to support me and our family.' 'As a father, I work hard to provide the love and support that young people need to grow up as happy and healthy adults. 'I am completely devastated by how this event has been presented in public but fully understand my responsibilities as a male and father to ensure the safety and care of my family and children. We will continue to work with our family and support services.'

"Belgian police have arrested a camouflage-clad Slovakian man after finding a gun and chainsaw in his car - after hundreds of people were evacuated from the nearby European Parliament. The suspect, identified as a Slovak national born in 1982, was deemed to be acting suspiciously, and told police officers that he wanted to meet the European president, prosecutors said. Police then sealed off an area around the man's parked car until they could establish that it contained no explosives. What they found was a chainsaw and a gun. Scroll down for video . Belgian police arrested a man clad in camouflage after finding a gun and chainsaw in his car. Policemen and a security officer stand outside a European Parliament building in Brussels today . He is facing charges of 'threatening an attack, possession of an illegal weapon and unauthorized possession of a firearm requiring a license.' A judge will determine on Tuesday whether the man faces charges. Around 500 people from four European Parliament buildings in central Brussels were evacuated as a precautionary measure and a bomb squad was called in to search the vehicle. Police found a firearm and a chainsaw in the car but no explosives, according to the public prosecutor's office. Officers were alerted to the car after they detained a man behaving suspiciously near the city’s parliament early this morning. The suspect, who showed no signs of aggression throughout, declined to explain his behavior to police officers. Around 500 people were evacuated from European Parliament buildings in Brussels after a suspicious car was spotted . But the man 'said that he wanted to meet the president of the parliament,' a prosecutor's office statement said. Police gave the all-clear just before 1pm local time, and staff returned to their offices. Belgium has been on high alert since the terror attacks in Paris last month. The country has deployed soldiers to protect locations,including embassies and European and Jewish institutions. In mid-January, police carried out a series of raids on suspected foreign fighters in Belgium and France, acting on information that a terrorist cell was on the verge of launching an attack. Two suspects were killed in one raid, in and around the eastern town of Verviers on January 15, when authorities claimed they prevented an imminent and major terror attack on police. The Belgian Army is patrolling key sites in Belgium as a safety precaution against potential terrorist threats . Last week, Belgian authorities detained four suspects during an anti-terror sweep linked to the recruitment of potential jihadis to fight in Syria. Police searched 22 homes, mostly in northeastern Belgium on Friday but found no weapons, explosives or ammunition. The federal prosecutor's office said in a statement the sweep was aimed at ""uncovering the organization behind the recruitment and sending"" of individuals to Syria. It stressed the operation was not linked to the Paris attacks of early this month nor to the January 15 operation.","The suspect was identified as a Slovak national born in 1982 .

"A teenager has become the youngest person to be convicted of revenge porn in the UK after selling the photos for £10 when he was 14 (file image) A boy of 14 has become the youngest person in Britain to be convicted of ‘revenge porn’ after he used Facebook to sell explicit photographs of his ex-girlfriend for £10. The teenager was able to use the social networking site to arrange to send images privately of the 15-year-old girl to a friend after they had agreed the fee. A court heard how the boy had 170 images of the victim, which he was preparing to distribute before police raided his home. The victim had emailed the defendant the intimate photographs of herself during their short relationship. She told police that after they broke up she saw Facebook messages which revealed the photos of her had been sold. Police then seized her ex-boyfriend’s laptop, desktop computer and mobile phone. A second defendant, aged 15 at the time, claimed his friend had accidentally sent him an image of the girl, but he had then asked for more. He admitted paying £10 for two more explicit photos, which he put in a locked file on his computer. Last night Facebook declined to comment on this particular case but said alerts about inappropriate material were taken seriously. A spokesman also stressed that there is no mechanism with which to make purchases on Facebook. None of those involved in the case can be named for legal reasons. The teenager, who is now 16, appeared at Plymouth's youth court alongside the second defendant to answer charges. They were both given 12 month referral orders and must pay £100 in costs . Andrea Parsons, prosecuting, told a youth court in Plymouth that the girl did not realise she was doing anything wrong when she agreed to send the pictures to her boyfriend. She added: ‘When the relationship ended she asked that [he] destroy the photographs. It turned out the photos were then passed on to [the defendant’s friend] for a small sum of money.’ The boy who sent the pictures, now aged 16, was charged with two counts of distributing photographs of a child, as well as one count of possession of 24 images of a child with a view to them being distributed or shown to another. He was also charged with three counts of making indecent photographs of a child and possession of indecent photographs of children. The boy who received the pictures, now 17, faced two charges of possessing indecent photos of a child. Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws. It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught. Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet. Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images. The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions. However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages. Both defendants were given 12-month referral orders and must pay £100 in costs and a victim surcharge. Those who post ‘revenge porn’ pictures and videos could face two years in jail under new proposals. The Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, currently before Parliament, has an amendment dealing specifically with the practice. After the case in Plymouth on Friday, an internet safety expert said there needed to be more education for young people to understand that something described as ‘banter’ might actually be a serious crime. Andy Phippen, professor of social responsibility in IT at Plymouth University, said it was ‘encouraging’ that the case had gone to court because it showed the victim felt she could come forward. He said: ‘The fact there was money exchanged, the volume of images and that she was an ex-girlfriend indicates some malice in this case. It’s encouraging it has gone to court. In most incidents like this the victim wouldn’t have thought to complain.’ Will Gardner, of the charity Childnet International, said yesterday: ‘It is essential that schools and parents educate young people about the potentially serious consequences of taking and sharing sexual images. ‘Sex education in the digital age needs to teach young people the laws surrounding sex and the internet, and how consent, respect and trust are essential both online and offline. We can all do more to ensure that young people are given the tools and knowledge they need to stay safe online.’ Last month Macclesfield Magistrates’ Court heard that a teenager posted a revenge porn film on Facebook of her best friend having sex. Danika France filmed Leah Trevena without her consent. When Miss Trevena protested, 18-year-old France promised she would delete the video. But a month later the pair fell out and France posted the 15-second film on her own Facebook page. Miss Trevena, 19, a college student, reported her to police, saying she felt ‘humiliated and suicidal’.","Teenager had 170 indecent images of victim and used Facebook to sell two .

"Amy Hickson, 20, had admitted possessing extreme pornographic images involving animals as well as 600 indecent images of children when she was 17 . A woman is facing prison after she admitted possessing 'extreme' pornographic images involving animals and more than 600 indecent images of children when she was 17-years-old. Amy Hickson, now 20, of Alresford in Hampshire, admitted 13 charges which included making indecent photos of a child and possessing prohibited images and a movie of children. Hickson also admitted possessing 16 pornographic images involving animals which were classed as 'extreme, disgusting or obscene,' Winchester Crown Court heard. The offensive images included one showing a person performing a sexual act with a dog and 15 involving other animals. The court heard the images showed sexual acts being carried out in an 'explicit or realistic' manner. Hickson, of New Cheriton, changed her plea today just before she was due to stand trial. She admitted all 13 charges. All of the offences took place between June 2011 and February 2013. During this period Hickson would have been a teenager and as young as 17. The charges included eight counts of making indecent photographs of a child - one count alone involving 596 images. One charge was for making indecent pseudo photographs of a child. Hickson also admitted a further two counts of possessing indecent photographs of a child and admitted the two charges of possessing extreme pornographic images involving animals. The images were from all three categories; A, B and C - which indicate different levels of seriousness. Category A refers to pictures showing penetration and images involving an animal or sadism. Those covered by B include images involving non-penetration. C is the least serious, and is used for images not covered by the first two categories. Judge Susan Evans QC said: 'You will receive some credit for your guilty pleas. 'I am not going to say how much at this stage and I am going to adjourn this case for a pre-sentence report.' Hickson was granted conditional bail to appear back at court on March 6. Winchester Crown Court heard Hickson possessed images in all three categories of seriousness; A, B and C .","Amy Hickson, 20, admitted possessing extreme porn involving animals .

"Police suspect that the driver of the tragic crash that killed three people on Sunday may have been distracted by a family member when the accident happened. Darren and Susana Milne were driving with their two sons in a silver Toyota station wagon heading north on Enterprise Drive at Berkeley Vale on the NSW Central Coast on Sunday afternoon when the car veered off the road and hit a tree. Darren, 42, Susana, 39, and their seven-year-old son died in the crash. The boy’s older brother, 11, was flown to The Children’s Hospital at Westmead and is in a critical condition.

"Self-titled Welfare Queen Marie Buchan has once again fanned the flames of anger over her right to claim benefits to support her eight children. The 33-year-old, of Selly Oak in Birmingham, who lives in a council house and receives handouts of £26,000 a year, appeared on today's This Morning to feature in a debate on the government's proposed cap on benefits. In last week's Daily Mail, she said a cap at £23,000 would leave her and her young family struggling to survive. She appeared on the ITV show today to further argue her case. Scroll down for video . The pair debated on today's This Morning prompting floods of comments from viewers . Mother-of-eight Marie said she would struggle to hold down a job whilst caring for her brood but Julia, right, said she should have thought about that before she had them . She said: 'I'd be lost without benefits. I didn't chose to be left on my own. I use the money to raise my eight children, they will go to school and university and hopefully get jobs to put back into system.' Marie, who has been on benefits since she was 19, said she is 'eager' to work but she has struggled to find a job she can fit in around her commitments as a single mother. 'There's eight children, they could go to after school club and breakfast club but if they are ill what do I do?' she said. 'I did get a job but as I struggled to get them all ready in morning, I had to call and tell them I couldn't attend,' she said. 'I tried for another job working 16 hours a week but they said no as my face is known from the papers. I am eager to work, I would be a cleaner. I have an appointment at the job centre tomorrow.' Marie cares for Tia, 12, Leah, 11, Latoya, nine, Joshua, eight, Alisha, six, Mikayla, four, Amelia, two, and Olivia, one, on her own after she split up with their father. She said he's 'a working man' who only sees his children at weekends. Broadcaster Julia Hartley-Brewer, who appeared on the ITV show to debate with Marie, asked her why she carried on having children when she knew she couldn't support them. The 46-year-old from London, who is married with an eight-year-old daughter, said: 'It's your sense of entitlement that makes people angry. You made a choice to have eight children.' She accused Marie of abusing the welfare system. 'Most mothers work whether they are single or married because it's the right thing to do, the only way we can afford welfare is because people work,' she argued. Marie is raising Tia, 12, Leah, 11, Latoya, nine, Joshua, eight, Alisha, six, Mikayla, four, Amelia, two, and Olivia, one, on her own after she split up with their father . 'You are bright and in good health, you have a moral duty to work,' she told Marie. 'How can you expect to live the life you want and expect everyone else to pay for it? You're telling everyone we are mugs for going to work. Why don't we all not work and get benefits?' Julia said Marie has no excuse not to work as there are thousands of jobs for cleaners available and many other single mothers manage to get their children organised so they can hold down a position. 'Others struggle to make ends meet to help people like you, many on minimum wage,' she said. 'We have made it possible for you to have this situation.' Hundreds of viewers contacted the show to join in the debate. Lauren Wright wrote on the This Morning Facebook page: 'If you can't afford to have eight children don't have eight children. Why should I pay to help you bring up your children when I'm working hard to look after my own rather than scrounging??' The family live in a council house and Marie admits they'd 'be lost' without benefits . Becci Jones agreed. She wrote: 'I work long shifts, weekends and pick up no where near £2,000 a month. If you want children then why should the tax payers pick up your bill!' Caroline Martin added: 'I'm a single mum and have worked since my little boy was eight months. I only get working tax and child tax credits. This pays for nursery fees only. I get no other support from the state. Make me angry as I'd like to be at home with my little boy but I know that I am giving him the best role model I can be.' But others rushed to defend Marie saying they felt sorry for her. Beccy Wheeler said: 'If you think life is better on benefits. Quit your jobs and try it.' It's not the first time Marie has caused controversy by making a TV appearance to air her views on her right to live off benefits. In December, she appeared on Channel 5 show Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole where she admitted she was showering her children with Christmas gifts rather than using her benefits money to pay the rent. She defiantly said: 'A lot of people will see this and once they are all wrapped think ""how dare she, she's on benefits and she has all these presents for her kids and we only have two or three for ours because we are working full time and can't afford it"". 'But everyone deserves a Christmas and why should we on benefits not be able to? For my children not to be able to open a present on Christmas day because we're on benefits, it's just not right, there shouldn't be a stigma for that.' She added: 'If I go back to work doing 12 hours a day it would be positive as I would be at work but the effect on the kids - they would have to go to breakfast club before school, after school club and then not know when I will be home. 'So is it better to work and neglect the kids or be a stay at home mum till the benefits stop?' On today's This Morning, Marie said she believed her children won't grow up to be on benefits like her because she doesn't think the welfare system will exist in the future as it does now. She admitted she has made a rod for her own back being so brazen about her right to benefits in the press and on TV. 'I do regret it contacting a paper in the first place,' she said.","Marie Buchan, 33, of Birmingham, receives benefits of £26,000 a year .

"It comes at a premium price, but it seems organic food may not be worth shelling out for. Researchers claim it is no more nutritious than food grown using pesticides and chemicals – and won’t benefit your health. Many people pay as much as a third more for organic food in the belief that it is healthier and safer. However, Dr Dena Bravata and colleagues from Stanford University Medical Centre, California, found no clear evidence of any significant added health benefits. Is organic food healthier for you and worth the higher price tag? They also found that there was no guarantee organic food would be pesticide-free – a key attraction for many consumers – though it did have lower levels. Senior author Dr Bravata said: ‘There isn’t much difference between organic and conventional foods, if you’re an adult and making a decision based solely on your health.’ The results, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine journal, come from the biggest review yet of existing studies comparing the two types of food.  However, UK campaigners said the survey was not equipped to detect real differences. Researchers sifted through thousands of papers looking into the health benefits of organic food. The review included studies of people with organic and conventional diets, as well as research into nutrient levels, bacterial, fungal or pesticide contamination. Even if organic isn't healthier, it is still tastier in some people's eyes . Researchers found no consistent differences in the vitamin content of various foods. They also found no difference in protein or fat content between organic and conventional milk. They were also unable to identify specific fruits and vegetables for which organic appeared consistently to be the healthier choice. Certain organic foods produce higher greenhouse gas emissions than their conventional farmed counterparts . Co-researcher Crystal Smith- Spangler, who is also an instructor of medicine at Stanford’s School of Medicine, said: ‘Some believe that organic food is always healthier and more nutritious. We were a little surprised that we didn’t find that.’ The researchers did find organic produce was 30 per cent less likely to be contaminated with pesticides than conventional fruit and vegetables, but not guaranteed to be pesticide-free, while pesticide levels of all foods came within the allowable safety limits. Two studies of children found lower levels of pesticide residues in the urine of those on organic diets, though for all those studied the levels were below allowable safety thresholds. A spokesman for the Soil Association said: ‘This US study, of limited application in Europe, found organic food helps people avoid pesticides in their food. ‘However, the scientific methodology used for the review, while suitable for comparing trials of medicines, is not right for comparing different crops.’ Organic farming may not be better for the environment, according to Oxford University scientists. They found organic milk, cereals, and pork all generated higher greenhouse gas emissions than their conventionally farmed counterparts. Organic beef and olives produced lower emissions.","Stanford University team find no evidence of added health benefits .

"Seattle Seahwaks head coach Pete Carroll has taken the blame for his controversial play call in the dying moments of the Super Bowl and said he didn't run the ball because he thought they had time to seal the win. His team had the ball on the one-yard line, needing a touchdown to win the game with Marshawn Lynch, one of the league's best running backs, in the backfield. Yet, instead of asking Lynch to try and make that yard, Seattle ran a passing play, with Russell Wilson trying to find receiver Ricardo Lockette. Patriots corner Malcolm Butler read the situation perfectly, timed his move and made the interception to assure a fourth Super Bowl title for the Patriots. Explaining his decision he said they didn't want to run against their goal line defense and were planning on waiting until the third or fourth down to make the game-winning play. He therefore decided to 'waste' the play. Scroll down for video . Dejected: Pete Carroll is facing a backlash after making what some have called the 'worst play call ever' in the dying moments of the Super Bowl . Determined: Russell Wilson responded to the criticism on Monday after taking some of the blame for the play . He said: 'Really what happened, it was frankly really clear, we went to three receivers and they sent in their goal line people. We had plenty of downs and a time out and didn't want to run against their goal line people right there. 'I told my guys that's my fault totally. We had plenty of time to win the game. We were playing for third or fourth down, but it didn't work out that way.' The decision to pass rather than give the ball to Lynch was instantly criticized by former players and analysts. 'That was the worst play call I've seen in the history of football,' tweeted Hall of Fame running back and three-time Super Bowl winner Emmitt Smith. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll was not surprisingly the man given the blame. 'That play call will haunt Pete for the rest of his career,' tweeted former Cowboys receiver Terrell Owens. 'Give the ball to Beastmode (Lynch) in that situation.' Carroll said his thinking was that the Patriots had their run defense in place and with his wide receivers on the field, they were not well matched-up for a run play. Crucial moment: Seattle ran a passing play, with Russell Wilson trying to find receiver Ricardo Lockette. But Patriots corner Malcolm Butler intercepted and secured the title . He added: 'It is a really clear thought but it didn't work out right. We happened to throw them the ball and they make a big play. 'At this time it seems like overthinking but they have extra guys at the line up scrimmage so we don't want to waste a run play on that,' he said. 'We make those decisions every game, all the time. They work out sometimes and they don't other times. This one didn't work out right for us.' Wilson agreed. 'We had a good play. If it was a catch, it would be a completely different story. I thought it was going to be a touchdown when I threw it. I thought it was going to be game over,' he said. Carroll said he and Wilson had shared a moment of disbelief at the end of the game. 'We just looked at each other trying to realize the gravity of what we just witnessed. We didn't say very much'. Some of the Seahawk players however disagreed. Linebacker Bruce Irvin told NFL.com he did not understand the call as they have 'the best back in the league'. Damning: ESPN analyst and former NFL player Emmitt Smith shared his opinion of the play during the game . Criticism: Terrell Owens, who played in the NFL for 15 years, also slammed the call . Shocked: Writer Tucker Max compared the coach's decision to bad choices he has made in life . Deflategate: Another social media said Carroll's explanation was similar to the one made by Patriots head coach Bill Belichek during the scandal last week .

"We all need a tonic in winter. Mine has come in the form of a weekly virtual visit to Guadeloupe now that the new series of BBC’s Death In Paradise has begun: sunshine, sandy beaches and the handsome Kris Marshall. But it’s also a reminder of a glorious week when I actually went to Guadeloupe - where the programme is shot - and saw this lovely island that combines the best of France with a typically Caribbean laid-back attitude. A Caribbean classic: Guadeloupe has a sleepy feel, and brings a touch of French flair to the region . It comprises the tiny islands of Marie-Galante, La Desirade and Iles des Saintes and the main island, a butterfly-shaped landmass with two very different halves. Grande-Terre, to the east, is more developed, with clusters of small beach towns and long curves of powdery white sand. The other half, Basse-Terre, is wilder, with flora and fauna-filled national parks, rugged black and surf-dashed beaches. I based myself here at the Langley Resort Fort Royal. As did the Death In Paradise crew, it turned out - something I discovered when I spotted Kris Marshall and Will Mellor taking a shower together (I should point out that the shower in question was on the beach and that the two actors had just been for a swim). This is not your typical tourist Caribbean island. It is one yet to be discovered by the wider world, although visitor numbers have been increasing since the first series of the show. One day, I headed for the lush slopes of the La Grande Soufriere volcano. The hike to its blackened summit took 90 minutes, and the trail was littered with car-sized boulders. A boost in profile: Guadeloupe is the tropical setting for the enjoyable BBC series Death In Paradise . As I neared the peak, the colour of the moss-covered rocks changed from green to a sulphurous yellow and squeaking bats dive-bombed me as I scrambled past their cave. Reaching the top was like arriving on another planet, with mutant-like patches of impossibly bright green grass and steep slopes of smoking rock falling away into the seemingly bottomless caldera. On the way home, I spotted a man pressing sugar cane by the roadside, and stopped to watch him push the thick stalks of vegetation through the rollers. The gloopy yellow juice drained into a container, and he offered me a swig. It was good, though I could almost feel my teeth rotting. I spent my days on Marie-Galante impersonating Columbus, wandering along deserted beaches, eating fresh fish at bamboo-thatched restaurants and exploring the remains of crumbling windmills. A hideaway on the edge of the surf: The little coastal village of Deshaies sums up the island's appeal . Back on the mainland, I discovered a reminder of the island’s dark past in the seaside village of Petit-Canal. Les Marches des Esclaves is a pathway connecting the harbour with the building where slaves would be taken for sale after arriving from Africa. There’s a stone staircase engraved with the names of the countries they came from, and a notch in the wall where slave masters hung their whips. I truly hope Guadeloupe doesn’t change.

"A couple who first met when they were just five years old have finally married some 65 years later in a romance that rivals that of TV drama Last Tango in Halifax. Like the plot lines of the BBC show starring Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid, life tore Colin Stevens and Patricia Higgs apart before fate brought them back together. Their love story was even sealed with a wedding in Halifax. Colin Stevens and Patricia Higgs met on their first day of school at St Mary's RC Primary School in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 1949. For Colin it was infatuation at first sight. Colin Stevens and Patricia Higgs love story has been compared to that of Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid in Last Tango in Halifax, right; the pair met when they were five, but it wasn't until this year that they married . Colin and Patrica got married this year in Halifax; having first met in 1949, the couple didn't see each other again until 1986 when fate brought them back together . He recalls being so scared he 'felt like crying'. Then he noticed his wife-to-be, a wee girl in a blue dress with flowers on it, 'the prettiest thing I'd ever seen'. Throughout his years at the school his feelings never waned and 11 Colin and Patricia moved to the same comprehensive school. Boys and girls were separated for lessons, but the pair found each other in the school's playground and with other friends they hung out in the streets together after class. As Colin got older his feeling got stronger and eventually he was bold enough to make a move. As teenagers they enjoyed their first kiss at Patricia's house. At 15 Colin asked Patricia out, but they only managed one date before fate drove them apart for several decades.  Patricia's family moved to Halifax, something that happened so quickly the lovebirds never even had a chance to say goodbye or swap addresses. Colin said it was love at first sight when he met Patricia on the first day at school at St Mary's RC Primary School in Bradford, West Yorkshire in 1949; he said he was so scared he 'wanted to cry', then he saw her . After going their separate ways as teenagers Colin began working in showbusiness; he married twice and had two children before divorcing; Patricia married and had five sons . In the following years Colin and Patricia built very separate lives away from each other. Colin, living in Essex and working in showbusiness, married twice and had two children before divorcing. Patricia also married and had five sons. When one of them died, her marriage also fell apart. In 1986, when Colin returned to Bradford for his daughter's wedding, a chance conversation led to him being put back in touch with Patricia. A woman recognised him and asked if he attended the same school as her niece. As chance would have it, that relative was his one true love. Colin told her he was meeting old school friends at a bar later, and while reminiscing with them the phone in the pub rang. It was for him, and like his first meeting with Patricia age five, it was something Colin will never forget. The person on the phone was Patricia. 'I couldn't believe it. We ­arranged to meet the next day. We hadn't seen or spoken to each other for years but when I saw her again, my heart skipped a beat. She'd scarcely changed. She was just as beautiful and bubbly as ever, ' Colin told the Sunday People. The pair went for a drive and soon realised that the spark between them was still very much alive. But although Patricia was finally single, Colin was in a relationship and living in Essex. The pair agreed to keep in touch, but Patricia was soon in another relationship. In 2005, Colin's son Stephen died aged 41, and he reached out to Patricia for support. She was there again in 2012 when he was diagnosed with cancer. Patricia said: 'Like TV's Celia and Alan, we were childhood ­sweethearts. Like them, we are ­together again and ­determined to make the most of it' It was after Colin attended his daughter's wedding in 1986 and Patricia's aunt recognised him that the pair got back in touch for the first time in almost 30 years . Jacobi and Reid  as the septuagenarian lovebirds Alan and Celia . Read in Last Tango in Halifax . Colin and Patricia finally got together after Colin beat cancer in 2013; after visiting his long lost love with champagne Colin stayed the night and in the morning they confessed their long-standing love for each other . 'When I told Patricia, I could hear the ­devastation in her voice,' Colin said. A year later, now in remission, Colin visited Patricia with two bottles of champagne. They planned to go out for dinner, but later cancelled the reservation. Colin assumed he would stay in the spare room, but Patricia had other ideas. Patricia told the newspaper: 'I came right out and told him, 'If you think you're sleeping in there, you've got another thing coming. I've waited 60-odd years for you and I'm not waiting any longer!' The following day Patricia told Colin she had loved him since 'we were five'. Colin said, 'me too'. In May the pair married in Halifax. Patricia said: 'Like TV's Celia and Alan, we were childhood ­sweethearts. Like them, we are ­together again and ­determined to make the most of it.' Colin added: 'We are incredibly happy. Patricia's son Jason teases us, saying it's a slow waltz in Halifax, not a tango. But the long wait means we cherish what we have.'","Colin Stevens and Patricia Higgs met at primary school in West Yorkshire .

"David Cameron was today forced to defend the fawning tributes paid to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia – despite his country’s shameful record on human rights. The Prime Minister insisted Britain needs a relationship with oil giants in the Middle East, regardless of their legal systems. And he revealed that Saudi Arabia supplied a piece of counter-terrorism intelligence that saved hundreds of lives in Britain. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured today, insisted Britain needs a relationship with oil giants in the Middle East, regardless of their legal systems . Mr Cameron was heavily criticised last month after flags flew at half mast over Buckingham Palace, Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament to mark the death of King Abdullah. The Prime Minister jetted to the Gulf with Prince Charles to pay tribute to the authoritarian and hugely powerful monarch. Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, condemned the decision to fly flags at half mast as ‘a steaming pile of nonsense’. She added that it was a ‘stupid act on its own and a stupid precedent to set’. Saudi Arabia, which last year is reported to have carried out 87 beheadings, has attracted further outrage after the first public flogging of blogger Raif Badawi, 31, who was sentenced to 1,000 lashes and ten years in jail for highlighting the kingdom’s harsh laws on dissent. Mr Cameron was taking part in a Sky News Q&A with young people at the Facebook headquarters in London . But Mr Cameron insisted that concerns about human rights had to be weighed against co-operation from Saudi Arabia in cracking down on terrorists. The Prime Minister insisted his first duty was to protect the public, even if that means doing business with regimes he 'didn't always agree with'. Appearing on the Ask The Leaders event organised by Sky News and Facebook, Mr Cameron said: 'I can tell you one time since I've been Prime Minister, a piece of information that we have been given by that country has saved potentially hundreds of lives here in Britain. 'Now, you can be Prime Minister and say exactly what you think about every regime in the world and make great headlines, and give great speeches. 'But I think my first job is to try and keep this country safe from terrorism and if that means you have to build strong relationships sometimes with regimes you don't always agree with, that I think is part of the job and that is the way I do it. And that is the best way I can explain it.' Mr Cameron offered his condolences to Saudi Arabia's new King Salman during his visit to the Middle East . The Prime Minister jetted to the Gulf with Prince Charles to pay tribute to the authoritarian and hugely powerful monarch . Flags were flown at half mast across Westminster  following the death of the authoritarian ruler of Saudi Arabia King Abdullah - including at Buckingham Palace . Mr Cameron was asked whether the relationship with Saudi Arabia was based on the fact it had huge oil reserves. In a bluntly honest response he admitted: 'Yes, of course. Of course Britain needs to have relationships with countries we trade with, including those that we buy oil and gas from. We can't make all our oil and gas here in the UK, we're doing well because we've got North Sea Oil,' he said. Mr Cameron stressed that he raised human rights with regimes that had dubious records. 'It's perfectly possible to go to those countries as I do and raise human rights abuses. 'In fact I would argue that if you have a relationship with them and you have a way of talking to them they are more likely to listen to you than if you just cut yourself off.' Supporters of King Abdullah, who was succeeded by his 79-year-old half-brother Salman, claim that the absolute ruler followed a difficult path maintaining good relations with the West – Saudi Arabia is a key ally in the war on terror as well as an important business partner for the UK – while putting into place mild reforms. Soon after his death, Mr Cameron said the king ‘will be remembered for his long years of service to the Kingdom, for his commitment to peace and for strengthening understanding between faiths’.","Prime Minister challenged over fawning tributes to Saudi monarch .

"Mr Justice Cobb held a two day hearing at the Court of Protection after health and social services applied to sterilise a mother-of-six against her will . A mother-of-six with severe learning difficulties could be taken into hospital using 'necessary restraint' to sterilise her. At a hearing at the Court of Protection, health and social services applied for permission to enter the woman's home and take her to hospital to be sterilised against her will because they said her health would be put at risk if she had more children. John McKendrick, who represented a health authority, hospital trust and council - which cannot be identified - said the application was 'extraordinary' and would involve serious interference with the woman's human rights. Mr Justice Cobb held a two day hearing into the case and heard that health workers had struggled to get the woman, who cannot be named, to take contraception, the Sun reported. Her six children have been taken into care and Mr Justice Cobb said the case was one of 'enormous gravity.' The hearing took place at the Court of Protection in London, the UK's most secretive court which deals with cases involving usually highly vulnerable people who lack the mental ability to make decisions for their well being themselves. The court heard that the woman, who is in her 30s, has medical problems which will pose a significant risk if she has another child. Michael Horne, appointed by the court to represent the woman's interests, said: 'The issues have nothing to do with eugenics. 'It is a ""therapeutic"" sterilisation in that it most effectively mitigates the grave risks to health and life that a further pregnancy could bring.' Mr Justice Cobb ordered that none of the parties could be identified and will give his judgement soon. Barristers said the bid at the Court of Protection in London was 'extraordinary' but important for her health .","Mother-of-six with learning difficulties will be at risk from further pregnancy .

"A Tasmanian Tiger Snake will be cared for by humans for the rest of her life after being diagnosed with a rare condition which will eventually cause her spine to fuse. Dubbed Rocky, after being found in the Rocky Hills, on the east coast of Tasmania, on Saturday afternoon, the 60cm female is believed to be only one of just 16 snakes in the world to suffer from Charcot's Disease. Now in the safe hands of Reptile Rescue Tasmania, the staff were gobsmacked to discover from x-rays that Rocky has an incredible 28 lumps along her spine which are at least the size of marbles - if not larger. Scroll down for video . Rocky the Tasmanian tiger snake will spend the rest of her days in captivity after being diagnosed with a rare condition which will eventually cause her spine to fuse . An x-ray revealed that Rocky has an incredible 28 growths along her spine as large as marbles - if not bigger . Reptile Rescue Tasmania CEO Bruce Press said he got a big shock when he found Rocky in a hole . Rocky can no longer breed, raise her tail to go the toilet or climb trees - which is a favourite past time of tiger snakes - therefore she can never be released into the wild. 'She's not allowed to breed because she will pass on the genes and it's currently mating season so we need to keep her away from males,' Reptile Rescue Tasmania CEO Bruce Press, told Daily Mail Australia. But Mr Press said the good news was Rocky is suffering little or no pain. 'She moves around on the ground as well and as fast as any another snake,' he said. 'We had a good look at the x-rays and the spine is nowhere near looking like fusing yet so she has a good many years left in her.' However, when the spine eventually fuses Mr Press said the most humane action was for her to be euthanased. He said he got the shock of his life when he pulled Rocky out of a hole with a hook. 'I thought ""Oh My god"",' he said. 'I didn't know whether she had a disease or an infection - or someone had tried to kill her.' Mr Press estimates she is about 12-18 months old but says it was hard to gauge with her abnormal spine. 'She's a freak of nature - her head is significantly bigger compared to her body length,' he said. 'The growths are just ginormous - it's just shocking - so she could be four years old.' Aside from her spine, he described her as 'well-hydrated' and an 'extremely healthy specimen' who ate four small mice last night. Rocky has created worldwide attention with Mr Press receiving more than 300 phone calls since she was diagnosed with the rare condition just 24 hours ago. Rocky is believed to be one of only 16 snakes in the world to suffer from Charcot's Disease . Rocky (pictured getting an x-ray) will never be able to breed or climb trees again .

"These shocking clips capture the heart-stopping near misses recorded on level crossings around the country including one video of a man seconds away from being killed by a train. In another astonishing piece of footage a cyclist is sent flying from his saddle by the closing barriers after failing to stop in front of the flashing lights. The CCTV videos were released by the British Transport Police (BTP) as part of a new campaign to stop people misusing crossings. Scroll down for video . Seconds from death: British Transport Police have released a series of near miss videos on level crossings as part of a new safety campaign. Here, a man strolls over  seconds before a train in Dundee, Scotland . In another clip, a motorist gets stuck on the train tracks after driving across the line as the barriers shut. As part of the safety campaign, officers are carrying out a number of high-visibility patrols at a number of locations during a week of action that started today. BTP will team up with the Network Rail in the 'Operation Look' awareness campaign, backed by the RAC and the AA, in a bid to promote the safe use of level crossings. Inspector Becky Warren of BTP said: 'All too often people get into the habit of taking risks at crossings and our message is simple, use crossings safely. Risking his life: The man was seen on CCTV casually passing the closed barriers on the crossing in Dundee . 'It may be tempting to jump a light to shave a minute or two off your journey, but every time you do, you endanger your life and the lives of other road and rail users. 'Fail to obey the signals and you may also end up with a driving ban or a criminal record - is it really worth the risk?' Figures showed that 337 motorists failed to obey warning lights or lowering barriers at level crossings in Scotland last year. Darren Furness, head of level crossings for Network Rail, said: 'Level crossings create a risk for people that we want to remove. 'Where possible we close them and we have already closed more than 900 in the past five years. Drives on to track:  A driver in a rush attempts to go over a level crossing as the barriers are being lowered in Narborough, Leicestershire . Stranded: The motorist is suddenly forced to turn as their way is blocked by the safety barrier . Danger: The motorist desperately drives away from the crossing before the oncoming train can arrive . 'Those we cannot close we aim to make safer and awareness events like these mean we can meet and talk to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians about the dangers and how to stay safe. 'We know waiting at crossings can sometimes be frustrating but it is really important that people do not get complacent or ignore warnings lights as this can put lives at risk.' BTP will deploy their fleet of mobile safety vehicles at crossings across the country throughout the week of action and offer safety advice to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. Tina Hughes, Network Rail's level crossing champion, said: 'Having lost my 14-year-old daughter, Olivia, with her friend on a level crossing in 2005, I am delighted to see this nationwide week of action. 'It brings BTP and Network Rail together to emphasise the importance of education and enforcement to help and encourage people to behave safely at level crossings.' Knocked off bike: A cyclist is sent flying after crashing into the safety barrier in Spondon, Derbyshire . Lucky to be alive: The shaken cyclist did not appear to be badly injured and was able to pick up his bike and ride away . Risky: A truck driver bolts over a level crossing in Ashtead, Surrey as the barriers begin to close . The safey campaign has been welcomed by Tina Hughes, whose daughter Olivia Bazlington was killed with her 13-year-old friend Charlie Thompson when they were struck by a train at a level crossing in Elsenham, Essex. Ms Bazlington, who is Network Rail's level crossing champion, said: 'Having lost my 14-year-old daughter, Olivia, with her friend on a level crossing in 2005, I am delighted to see this nationwide week of action. 'It's just the most awful experience and I don't want anyone else to go through this. If you are hit by a car you might survived but if it's by a train you won't. 'Trains can't stop so even if the driver sees you they cannot do anything. It's a horrible experience for the driver but for the family it's worse.' This week BTP will station safety vehicles with automatic number plate recognition cameras to catch dangerous drivers in the act.

"A screenshot (pictured) posted to Reddit is the first to show how Whatsapp's Calls feature will look . Whatsapp first hinted it would let users make free calls to each other early last year. And it now seems the hugely popular messaging app has started rolling out the feature to a select number of users. A screenshot, posted to Reddit at the weekend, reveals how the Calls tool  looks on a Nexus 5 device running Android Lollipop. In the image, a new tab has been added that shows 'Calls', in addition to the existing 'Chats' and 'Contacts' options. Users can then open the Calls tab, select a contact and make a voice call using an internet connection. This is similar to how Skype connects web-based calls, a service known as 'voice over internet protocol' or VoIP. In December, Dutch site AndroidWorld uncovered clues about Whatsapp's voice calling feature while studying the app's test code. Expert Sander Tuit then extracted layout files, images and text from the raw code to create a series of mock-up screenshots. The latest grab was posted to Reddit by user pradnesh07, although it has since been removed because it contained personal details. Other messaging apps, including Viber, already offer free voice and video calls to users, and it's believed Whatsapp's update is designed to rival such services. In December, Dutch site AndroidWorld uncovered clues about the feature while studying the app's test code. It then extracted layout files from the raw code to create mock-up screenshots (pictured). The new tool is only available to select users, but if someone with the feature calls someone without it, it forces the update . Other messaging apps, including Viber (pictured), already offer free voice and video calls to users . On Viber, the Calls tab shows all the voice calls received, made and missed, and Whatsapp's update is expected to feature a similar log. According to Reddit, the update is only available to a select number of users, but if someone with the update tries to call someone without it, the call forces the recipient to download the new tool. It is not known when the feature will roll out more widely and MailOnline has contacted Whatsapp for comment. Skype was one of the first firms to make VoIP a mainstream technology, and last year it launched a translator. The beta version of its live translation tool lets people speak to others in another language - even if they don’t know what they’re saying. The tool then translates speech instantly, providing both text and spoken translations. The public version launched with English and Spanish translations, but the Microsoft-owned firm is looking to add more than 40 languages to the service. Google also recently launched a live translation tool to is Google Translate app, and this could be the next step for messaging apps such as Viber and Whatsapp. Last year, Whatsapp  updated its service to make it harder to avoid messages. The Facebook-owned app now displays two blue ticks in the bottom right-hand corner of an individual message to show it has been read. To use the new Whatsapp tool, users open the Calls tab, select a contact and make a voice call using an internet connection. This is similar to how Skype (pictured), for example, connects web-based calls, using a service called 'voice over  internet protocol' or VoIP . Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) lets people make free, or low cost, telephone calls over the web. Popular VoIP services include Viber and Skype. VoIP can be used anywhere in the world and can call landline and mobile numbers. And clicking on the message shows the precise time the recipient opened and read it. Before the update, there were only two types of tick - a single grey tick meant the message had been successfully sent, and a double grey tick meant it had been delivered. Now, when a message has been sent, delivered and read, the double grey tick turns blue. In a group chat, the second ticks appear when all participants in the group have received the message. The two blue ticks only appear when all participants in the group have read the post. To see what time the messages were read users can now press and hold down on a particular post. Again, this is similar to a 'read' feature that was already being used by Viber. Last year, Whatsapp updated its service to make it harder to avoid messages.  A single grey tick on a message means it has been sent, a double grey tick means it has been delivered, and two blue ticks mean it has been read (pictured). The update is available across all mobile platforms . In a group chat, the blue ticks only appear when all participants have read the message.To see what time the messages were read, users can now press and hold down on a particular post and select the Message Info option.

"When Beth Garvey and boyfriend Alex Troth went to see Dippy the dinosaur at the Natural History Museum they decided the perfect way to enjoy the experience would be to dress up as animals themselves. The teenage couple from Swindon in Wiltshire donned dinosaur and Pokemon onesies for the visit to the London museum. But they were soon deterred from making an exhibition of themselves and were told they would have to change before they were allowed in. Staff told Miss Garvey, 17 and Mr Troth, 18, to remove the costumes as they made their way into the museum because they visitors in fancy dress had caused problems in the past. Beth Garvey (left) and boyfriend Alex Troth were told to remove their Pokemon and dinosaur onesies when they visited the Natural History Museum in London and were told they would need to be stored in bags . The pair were forced to remove their onesies and store them in bags, which staff then insisted on searching to check nothing was concealed inside the outfits. 'We got pulled aside in front of everyone first, then they told us we had to take them off,' Miss Garvey said. 'Luckily we had clothes on underneath but a lot of people don't. 'They said it was classed as a costume and we couldn't wear that in the museum. We said, no it was pyjamas, you sell them yourselves. 'They were insistent it was a costume and asked if we were celebrating someone's birthday which was why we were wearing them. I was gobsmacked.' Both said they decided to wear onesies - Miss Garvey wearing a onesie depicting Pokemon character Umbreon-  for the college trip after they were told to wear something comfortable. The teenage couple had planned to visit the museum's famous Dippy the dinosaur exhibit in the Central Hall . Both claimed they had worn the costumes for comfort and did not understand why they were asked to change . They travelled to London, by train, without any questions and made their way to the museum, in South Kensington, in December. Miss Garvey said she also found having to have their bags searched in front of everyone humiliating. The pair's onesies were later stored behind a desk . She added: 'They made us stand there, in front of everyone, we felt like we have done something really, really wrong. 'Then they took our onesies from us and put them behind the desk, giving us this ticket we could use to collect them when we were done at the museum at the end of the day. 'All for an item of clothing which they sell in their own shop. 'It was very strange, they didn't have any signs, I checked the website when I got back to see if I'd missed something. 'There was nothing about any other forms of clothing on, it just said you could take anything as long as it was not threatening.' A spokesman for the museum said there was no particular dress code for entry to the museum, but the duty manager has responsibility for deciding who is allowed inside. He said: 'We have in the past had visitors in costumes cause disturbances in the building, which affected other people's experience at the museum. 'After their onesies were put in the cloakroom Ms Garvey and her partner continued their visit and we offered complimentary tickets in recompense for the inconvenience and embarrassment they felt.'","Beth Garvey and Alex Troth visited the Natural History Museum in London .

"Ed Miliband today insisted he had enough 'life experience' outside politics to lead the country - because he had been an adviser to Gordon Brown. The Labour leader said roles in the Treasury and lecturing at Harvard University in the United States before he became an MP qualified him to be prime minister. Mr Miliband highlighted his previous jobs as he took questions at from young voters today after being asked how he represented ordinary people. Ed Miliband worked as an adviser to Gordon Brown before becoming the MP for Doncaster in 2005 . He was asked: 'Outside of politics, what life experience do you have ... to indicate you should be the one to represent the people of Britain?' Mr Milband, speaking at an Ask The Leaders session organised by Sky News and Facebook, replied: 'I've done a number of things which I think are relevant to this. 'I was obviously an economic adviser in the Treasury. I think that's important because the economy and how we change our economy is at the heart of the country.' He added: 'I taught at Harvard University. I actually taught around government and economics and I think that, actually, one of the things that that did for me (was learning) to listen and engage with people about what their issues are, what they're interested in.' Mr Miliband went to Oxford University before working briefly as a researcher in the media, and then becoming a Labour Party researcher. He was an adviser to Gordon Brown in the Treasury between 1997 and 2002, at which point he took an 18-month sabbatical to teach economics at Harvard.

"A former student of Marlborough in LA is planning to sue the school claiming she was taken advantage of by former teacher, Joseph Koetters (pictured) A prestigious girls' school, attended by some of Los Angeles' most affluent families, has been threatened by legal action from a former student who claims she fell pregnant by a teacher. The alleged victim, who has not been identified, is planning to sue Marlborough School more than a decade after she claimed she was coerced and manipulated into sex at the age of 16 with former teacher Joseph Koetters. The woman, who spoke to Vanity Fair, alleged that in the early 2000s, she was targeted by the English teacher and began having sex with him. She told the magazine: 'He made me feel like the smartest, funniest, most beautiful person walking the planet.' She was soon meeting up with the teacher at his home when his gynecologist wife was not there. She said that he normalized the inappropriateness of his actions, saying 'this is something special, and we’re entitled to pursue it as human beings'. The girl ended up pregnant but Koetter organized for her to have an abortion, she claimed. He went into 'clinical' mode and talked about 'handling it', she told Vanity Fair. She miscarried the baby just under three months into the pregnancy. Throughout her ordeal, the teenager told no one. The woman has claimed that she contacted Koetters in 2009 after hearing a rumor that he had turned his attentions to another student - which he denied. Daily Mail Online had reached out to her lawyer, David M. Ring, for comment on Monday. It is unclear when the suit will be filed. Also unclear is if the woman has filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department. The alleged victim decided to reveal her story after several former students said last year that Koetters had been inappropriate with them at the school - which counts heiress Betsy Bloomingdale, actress Camilla Belle and philanthropist Nancy Barry Munger among its alumni. These women had come forward to give their accounts of Koetters, now 47, following an essay in June 2014 by Marlborough alumna Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie (now a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania). Exclusive: Marlborough private school in LA costs $35,000-a-year and attracts female students from some of Los Angeles most prestigious families . Her essay, published on xoJane, revealed an inappropriate relationship that Koetters instigated with her in 2011 while she was a 16-year-old junior. In her essay, Miss Gilbert-Lurie said that Koetters crossed the student-teacher boundary when she asked to interview him for the school newspaper. He agreed, replying 'It's a date' to her email. Later when they met up  outside the school, she wrote that he dodged her questions and turned the conversation towards romantic poetry, saying he could lend her one of his favorite books. At the end of the conversation, his hands brushed against her knee. While Miss Gilbert-Lurie admitted in her essay that the flirting made her feel good at first, she became less comfortable with their relationship when he started getting more explicit in their email conversations. He said he knew how to draw boundaries with other students but not with her and talked about how her short school skirt made her 'so alluring'. A slew of allegations about Koetters' inappropriate behavior emerged following an essay published last summer by Marlborough alumna Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie (pictured) A few day later, the teen wrote him saying they needed to stop so she could focus on finals and 'just being 16'. Koetters responded 'Ugh, Ok,' but continued to harass her in class and through email, the teen claimed. With the support of her brother, she decided to tell her parents. In 2011, Miss Gilbert-Lurie and her parents informed the school about Koetters' inappropriate behavior, prompting  an investigation. Head teacher, Barbara Wagner, told the family that the complaint would be taken seriously - and was allegedly advised by the president of the board of trustees to handle the matter internally. When asked if there had been previous complaints against Koetters, it appeared that the head teacher failed to mention a similar complaint in 2005. It does not appear that complaint by a female student was credited at the time, according to the magazine. Koetters, who had taught at Marlborough for 14 years, was sent to sexual harassment training following Miss Gilbert-Lurie's complaints and stripped of his position as chair of the English department - but was not fired because it was a 'first-time offense'. Miss Gilbert-Lurie was moved to another English class. Marlborough claimed last year that they were unaware of Miss Gilbert-Lurie's allegation from her xojane essay that Koetters had touched her knee. The UPenn student said that the school had been informed. Koetters remained at the school alongside Miss Gilbert-Lurie for another year before starting a new job at  the elite Polytechnic School in Pasadena. Vanity Fair reported that Polytechnic was aware of Koetters' discipline at Marlborough. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from Polytechnic on Monday. However following Miss Gilbert-Lurie's explosive essay last summer, Buzzfeed found that she was not the only young women to have been the focus of Koetter's alleged unwanted advances. At least eight ex-students claimed a similar pattern of behavior from 47-year-old Koetters, which ranged from sexual comments to sexually-charged emails and touches on the knee. It appeared that Koetters complained about his wife, a gynecologist, and his children to the girls, before complimenting them on being gifted students. One former student, identified as Mariah, says Koetters once told her: 'I love you in ways that are totally inappropriate for a teacher to love a student.' She also recalled the time they were discussing the book Disgrace by JM Coetzee, which is about an inappropriate relationship between an English professor and a student. Mariah talked about how she wanted to write an essay on the book, focusing on predators and prey. That's when Koetters told her: 'Just because someone is in a position of power over someone else doesn't mean the relationship can't be mutual.' 'He told me that if we had sex, it could be mutual, it could me love,' Mariah recalled. She said he then put his hand on her knee. Another 2012 graduate recalled how Koetters would use his power over female students to turn friends against each other. A former student identified as Stephanie says he turned their innocent conversations about help with class into a venting session where he would complain about his family. Stephanie said she felt like an adult when he talked to her about his problems, but knows how wrong it was in retrospect. 'Now that I'm close to my thirties, I realize how wrong the situation was and regret not speaking out,' she said. The woman who spoke to Vanity Fair this month revealed that she had reached out to Koetters following Miss Gilbert-Lurie's xojane essay last year. He told her that Gilbert-Lurie was lying. It was then that the woman decided to contact Miss Gilbert-Lurie. Last summer, the two former Marlborough students went to the head of Polytechnic together where the head teacher claimed that he would file a police report. Koetters resigned that day. It was a shocking scandal for the $35,000-a-year institution, the oldest day school in California, which teaches girls from grades 7 - 12. Marlborough ranks in the top schools in the U.S. when it comes to SAT scores and students commonly go on to Ivy League colleges. The private school was forced to launch an investigation in the summer of 2014 following the revelations. The school's board of trustees put together a 'special investigative committee', made up of five of its own members, including a judge and high-powered attorney. Following the investigation, Marlborough reportedly sent an eight-page letter to parents where there was a buried a reference to Koetters 'inappropriate physical conduct' with a student. The committee placed full responsibility at the feet of beloved head teacher of 26 years, Barbara Wagner. She tendered her resignation and is due to leave at the end of the school year in June. Many feel that the head teacher has been hung out to dry by the school board, according to Vanity Fair, and there are rumbles of unease among the school's high-flying and generous donors. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a response from Marlborough on Monday.","The alleged victim is threatening legal action against Marlborough in LA, after Joseph Koetters 'started having sex with her when she was 16'

"Unwell: Ted Robbins (pictured) collapsed clutching his chest during the opening night of a revival of Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights live show. He had been due to have a heart operation in three weeks . Phoenix Nights actor Ted Robbins has laughed off collapsing on stage, speaking from his hospital bed for the first time since suffering a heart attack during a live show. The 59-year-old comedian thanked well-wishers for their kind messages, joking the health scare on Saturday was designed to 'upstage' his co-stars. 'It was all an attempt by Den Perry to upstage Potters big night!' said Mr Robbins. 'I'm overwhelmed by the love and kind messages from everyone. Love to everyone, see you soon,' he added. It comes as the actor's sister revealed he was due to undergo 'routine' heart surgery in just a few weeks before the incident over the weekend. Singer and comedienne Kate Robbins said her brother, who plays Den Perry in Peter Kay's comedy, had been left with a 'dodgy' heart valve after suffering rheumatic fever as a child. Mr Robbins was in the middle of a solo section when he stumbled to the ground - prompting the curtain to be closed immediately and the show to be cancelled at the Manchester Arena. A doctor ran on stage from the audience and saved his life. Initially, audience members thought the collapse was part of the show - before it emerged he was gravely ill. His sister said: 'He's doing great. He did have a cardiac arrest. Thanks to the really quick thinking of a doctor and a paramedic in the audience, he received a life-saving procedure. 'Ted has rheumatic fever as a child, which affected a heart valve - so we knew there was a problem. He was due to have a routine heart operation in the next three weeks. 'People think he's a big guy so he must have had a heart attack. It not as simple as that. He's always had a dodgy valve. 'He's actually been quite a fit man most of his life. This has just been an horrendous thing for us all.' He was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital after collapsing on stage on the opening night of Phoenix Nights Live at the Manchester Arena on Saturday. He remains in a stable condition at Wythenshawe Hospital - and is said to be in good spirits. Scare: Actor Ted Robbins is in hospital after collapsing on stage during the opening night of a revival of Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights live show but is feeling better, . Kate Robbins added: 'We were all hysterically laughing and jumping up and down when he came on in the second half - his daughter Molly, his wife and his son Jack. 'Then he just dropped like a stone and we just said ""that's not in the act"". We ran and had to barge past, but security wouldn't let us on stage. 'Thank God there was a heart surgeon in the audience and a paramedic who just got there and saved his life. It was a surreal nightmare. But luckily he's doing great.' Despite the terrifying on-stage collapse, Ted is said to be smiling from his hospital bed and he even had a joke for his family as they rushed to his side on Saturday night. Kate said: 'We walked in and he had his oxygen mask on. He just quietly went ""ta-da"". You can't take away his humour, even in that situation. 'What's been overwhelming has been the thousands and thousands of good wishes from everyone. 'There has been so many comedians saying such great things about him. 'Ted is known as ""the comedian's comedian"". He's known for his wit - but more so probably for his caring of other human beings.' Comedian Peter Kay led a standing ovation in support of Mr Robbins as Phoenix Nights returned to the stage at Manchester Arena on Sunday night. Before the show, the Bolton star wrote on his Facebook page: 'My thoughts, prayers and love to Ted, Judy and all of the family. So happy that Ted is in right place and getting the care he needs.

"Browns Quarterback Johnny Manziel has entered a rehabilitation facility, it was revealed today. Brad Beckworth, a Manziel family adviser, confirmed Monday that that the 22-year-old NFL star entered an unspecified rehab facility Wednesday. 'Johnny knows there are areas in which he needs to improve in order to be a better family member, friend and teammate and he thought the off-season was the right time to take this step,' said Beckworth. Scroll down for video . In treatment: Hard-partying Browns Quarterback Johnny Manziel entered a rehabilitation facility Wednesday . Party boy: Manziel's hard-partying and off-the-field antics were well known while he was in college . 'On behalf of Johnny and his family, we’re asking for privacy until he rejoins the team in Cleveland.' Browns general manager Ray Farmer also spoke out Monday about Manziel's decision to seek treatment: . 'We respect Johnny's initiative in this decision and will fully support him throughout this process. Our players' health and well-being will always be of the utmost importance to the Cleveland Browns. 'We continually strive to create a supportive environment and provide the appropriate resources, with our foremost focus being on the individual and not just the football player. 'Johnny's privacy will be respected by us during this very important period and we hope that others will do the same. ESPN reported that according to a source close to Manziel, the athlete is expected to be in treatment for at least a few weeks. Barfly: The athlete is expected to be in treatment for at least a few weeks . Alarming: A photo snapped of Manziel before the start of the season and later posted to Instagram showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter . A source told ESPN's Darren Rovell Manziel was offered six figures by a Las Vegas casino to host a Super Bowl party Sunday, but he rejected the proposition. Manziel's escapades  involving alcohol-fueled parties have been well-documented beginning from his time as a Heisman Trophy winner at Texas A&M, where he excelled on the field. In late December, the football star was photographed chugging champagne straight out of a bottle poolside at a Miami hotel. The incident came just days after Manziel, who was nursing a hamstring injury at the time, was fined for skipping out on a treatment session and walk-through for the last game of the season because he overslept after throwing a massive party in his mansion the night before. A source told ESPN that player was found at home 'drunk off his a**.' Manziel has denied organizing a party but was quick to apologize to the team for his antics, saying; 'It’s about being accountable and doing what I'm gonna say instead of looking like a jackass.' He added: 'Either I’m going to learn or I’m going to be finding something else to do.' 'Aha' moment: In a press conference December 29, Manziel said he plans to be accountable for his actions instead of looking like a jackass . Appearing on ESPN’s First Take to talk about Manziel's conduct, sports columnist Skip Bayless said the former college star must do something about his drinking. 'My concern, I repeatedly said, was if Johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol, and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails, then I’m going to be out,' said Bayless. Manziel was known for his partying while in college, but said he was a changed man during the 2014 NFL Draft, noting that he had 'grown up,' before being selected 22nd overall by Cleveland. Just days into his training with the Browns, however, the local press began calling him out on his partying, which they cited as the major reason for his lackluster performance on the field. Also causing alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of Manziel and later posted to Instagram that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter, leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine. In a press conference December 23, Manziel said his goal was to become 'the guy' for the team and take the job more seriously. Four days later, he failed to show up for a walk-through in Baltimore after allegedly getting drunk. Not mincing words: Sports columnist Skip Bayless has said the former college star must do something about his drinking . Manziel was fined for skipping out on a treatment session and walk-through for the last game of the season because he overslept . Distracted: Manziel, 22, played most of the season as a back-up to Brian Hoyer, starting just two games . Manziel played in five games as a rookie, starting only two, and completed 18 of 35 passes for 175 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions. Currently, the 22-year-old has a four-year contract with the Browns worth about $8.25million. Manziel also has some of the most lucrative endorsement deals in the sports world with, among others, Nike, McDonald's, MusclePharm, and Snickers. In late January, ESPN published a story in which some of Manziel's teammates were critical of their quarterback's work ethic. One member of the Browns team said that Manziel thought his rookie season was a '100 per cent joke.'","Browns and a Manziel family adviser confirmed the 22-year-old quarterback entered treatment program Wednesday .

"A couple who were doing more than catching up on their paper work in a Christchurch insurance office unwittingly also gave patrons of a nearby bar a proper night’s adult entertainment.

Customers across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery got a front-row seat for the show . Stuff.co.nz reported that the photos have attracted thousands of likes and hundreds of shares. 'The whole pub knew about it and was watching, while they were totally oblivious to it. And afterwards celebrating with wine,' one man posted. 'They should have turned the lights out,' said another. Some patrons even said that the band stopped playing while most of the bar watched out the windows. It got so steamy that the band even stop playing in the Carlton Bar and Eatery as the action continued . Marsh Ltd chief executive Grant Milne said the company was taking the matter seriously. The man and woman had been identified and an employment investigation was under way. 'We know who is involved. It's obvious from the photos,' Milne said. Milne would not say if the man and woman had returned to work, but that they were taking the matter very seriously and they may end up losing their jobs. 'It's not the type of behaviour we condone. It's very disappointing,' he said. All the unwanted online publicity was also embarrassing the company and this was not how they wanted to be portrayed. Revellers at the Carlton Bar and Eatery posted images on Facebook and Twitter of the couple . 'One of the challenges of social media is the inability to control things,' he said. Carlton owner James Murdoch said the bar had been in contact with Marsh Ltd. 'Obviously they're customers and we're working through it with them,' he said. The couple could still escape with a warning if a disciplinary inquiry finds that the encounter did not amount to serious misconduct.","Christchurch couple's sex romp in Marsh Ltd offices gets them in hot water .

A rag-and-bone trader who piled old fridges and ovens into his suburban garden has been fined after his Steptoe and Son-like hobby raised the hackles of council inspectors. Roy Harrison, 56, cannibalised parts from the white goods to fix up other machines and sell them on - despite him being served with an enforcement notice five years earlier. Harrison, who admitted being a 'lazy sod' for not storing the goods properly, has been made to pay £750 for failing to clear up the junk next to his £130,000 semi-detached home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester. Magistrates heard Harrison took parts from old washing machines, fridge freezers and microwave ovens to fix other electrical items. He gained so many white goods that some neighbours complained to council inspectors, who served him with a planning enforcement notice in 2009. Despite initially complying with the order, Harrison allowed the pile of junk to build up again and last year he again filled his front and rear gardens with washing machines and parts. Stockport Magistrates' Court fined him £250 and made him pay £500 in costs after he admitted being in breach of an council enforcement notice. Magistrates said it was a 'serious offence committed with no regard for his neighbours'. Stockport Council cabinet member Patrick McAuley said: 'Mr. Harrison in effect decided to use his house as a scrap yard with no regard whatsoever for his neighbours. 'He then compounded this by failing to comply with an enforcement notice served by the council. 'I welcome the strong message this conviction brings, as the council will take action where people breach planning controls to protect neighbours and the environment.' Harrison said after the case: 'It was my own fault and I'm sorry for what happened. I lost a shed I was using so I had to put these appliances somewhere. Tip: Harrison said he would take the parts from the microwaves and fridge freezers to fix other white goods . 'If I got two machines to take a part from one I would always keep the other one to,' Harrison said . 'Fixing washing machines and fridges is my hobby. When I first started I had lost my job and where I was working I used to have a unit then it shut down so I had to move it and it all came here. 'If I got two machines to take a part from one and put it in the other I would always keep the other one too rather than throw it away, in case I needed another part.' 'Being a lazy sod I just never got round to moving it again. I have paid for it now.' He added: 'They said it looked like I was running a business but on the first occasion I was just learning how to repair them. If I got a decent washer it was something else to do in case I came out of work. 'My drive was covered in kitchen appliances at one point but it looked worse as they were due to be taken away by the scrap men the next day. Scattered: Magistrates said the hobby was a 'serious offence committed with no regard for his neighbours' Home: The junk built up in the garden of Harrison's suburban semi in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester . 'I'm not going to go back to doing this stuff here anymore. I have another place now, I'm not that stupid.' Despite the complaints, some neighbours sprang to Harrison's defence. Steve Vicars said: 'Roy just fixes appliances. He has been doing it for as long as I've lived here and that's 16 years and it's never bothered me. 'Every once in a while he has a couple of washing machines and maybe a dryer but he fixes them and sells them on. 'It wasn't all over the place. He owns the house so I don't know why the council keep bothering him. 'He's a sound bloke. He's very willing to help people. There's never a massive amount in the garden and it's shifted within a week. I got a machine off him and I've had it for three years with no problems. It's never a tip.' Some neighbours defended Harrison, saying: 'I don't know why the council keep bothering him' Comedy duo: Steptoe and Son, the fictional BBC pair who made a living spotting gems in other people's junk . Another neighbour said: 'Roy s a sound bloke and he does what he does, fixes machines and everyone on the estate has stuff off him. 'Everyone on the estate will vouch for him. It's his own house anyway so I don't see what the issue is. It seems the council cannot help but stick their noses into other people's affairs.' A hit comedy for the BBC in the 1970s, Steptoe and Son focused on the lives of two rag-and-bone traders who scraped a living from spotting gems among other people's junk. The father and son duo, who lived in west London, were constantly arguing, swore like troopers and sold their goods from a horse-drawn cart.","Roy Harrison, 56, used his suburban garden to store fridges and ovens .

"Marked man: 'Jihadi John', the Islamic State militant who has murdered several Western hostages, is being hunted by British intelligence . David Cameron has told British spy chiefs to track down Islamic State executioner 'Jihadi John' so that special forces can move in to get him dead or alive, it was claimed today. Mr Cameron summoned the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ to Chequers, his country residence, to tell them hunting down the UK-born militant is now their top priority, according to reports. The new orders come after friends and relatives of Alan Henning, the British aid worker executed by the militants last week, accused the government of not doing enough to secure his release. Just 12 hours after the video apparently showing Mr Henning's murder was published online, spy chiefs gathered at Chequers to brief Mr Cameron on what they know, the Sunday Times reports. According to the paper, intelligence chiefs told the Prime Minister that information on the whereabouts of the militants is not yet reliable enough to launch a special forces raid. Citing unnamed sources, it claimed intelligence agencies were 'working around the clock' to locate Jihadi John and his comrades, with the majority of MI5's efforts now directed at the threat from Syria. The report contradicted claims made in the Mail On Sunday, according to which Jihadi John had been tracked to the Syrian city of Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold. U.S. Reaper drones flying high over the city in north-east Syria were said to have not only spotted the militant, whose face is covered when he appears in videos, but also hostages wearing orange jumpsuits. But, the report claims, military chiefs have ruled out a rescue operation because Islamic State defences are too strong. Special Forces bosses have instead advised the Ministry of Defence that a sustained bombing campaign lasting several weeks would be preferable, it says. A source said: ‘The imagery from the drones and satellites is instructive but IS infrastructure in Raqqa would have to be targeted over a sustained period to make any sort of raid a realistic possibility. ‘On the basis of our current advice there is very little chance of the Prime Minister signing off a rescue bid. The prospect of success has got to be 100 per cent or thereabouts, and at the moment it is nowhere near that. And for now there are not many other options on the table. 'While sightings of Jihadi John are useful, as was establishing his identity, we are still a long way off getting a hit on him. Right now a raid would be suicidal.’ It is not clear which report is most reliable, but last night, after his meeting with intelligence chiefs, Mr Cameron indicated he would be willing to deploy special forces units such as the Special Air Service (SAS). 'The murder of Alan Henning was absolutely appalling,' he said. 'It is senseless; it's completely unforgivable. Anyone in any doubt about this organisation can now see how truly repulsive it is and barbaric it is as an organisation. 'What we see with this organisation is that there is no level of depravity to which they will not sink. The fact that this was a kind, gentle, compassionate and caring man who had simply gone to help others, the fact they could murder him in the way they did shows what we are dealing with. 'We must do everything we can to defeat this organisation. We must take action against it and we must find those responsible.' Scroll down for video . Humanitarian: A picture of British aid worker Alan Henning in Syria. He was murdered last week by IS miltants . British intelligence and security agencies are already working closely with the FBI and CIA to find Jihadi John and his group of kidnappers in what is now a high-profile murder and counter-terrorism investigation. MI5 and Scotland Yard, aided by GCHQ communication monitoring, have identified the British man believed to have carried out the beheadings of two American journalists and two British aid workers. This information has been shared with a team of more than a dozen US investigators from an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, from the US agency’s counter-terrorism command, who are reported to have flown to the UK in the past few weeks. The jihadi nicknamed ‘John’ by the hostages he was holding – because he and the other British jihadis were known as The Beatles – is understood to come from a suburb of South London. It is believed his family members have been interviewed by Met officers and an FBI agent. Meanwhile, teams from MI6 and CIA have deployed field officers in Northern Syria to help pinpoint the exact location of the group of kidnappers. These teams have picked up valuable intelligence gathered by their agents operating within IS ranks. The US Senate has offered a £6million reward for any information that will lead to the capture of ‘John’.","David Cameron ordered spy chiefs to Chequers after killing of Alan Henning .

"His hands resting on the shoulders of Prince William and Prince Harry, a relaxed John Cantlie smiles for the camera. Taken six years ago, it is the first picture of the 43-year-old photo-journalist with the Royals since he was revealed to be the third British hostage held by Islamic State fanatics in Syria. With the bushlands of South Africa providing a stunning background and smiling faces, it is a stark contrast to the images of the Briton shown on the chilling IS propaganda video claiming he had been ‘abandoned’ by the government. Scroll down for video . African Adventure: John Cantlie, an experienced motorcyclist, accompanied the Princes on a 1,000 mile, eight-day charity ride – described by organisers as ‘an endurance test’ – across South Africa in 2008 . Cantlie, an experienced motorcyclist, accompanied the Princes on a 1,000 mile, eight-day charity ride – described by organisers as ‘an endurance test’ – across South Africa. He was the official photographer on the journey that saw the small team live, sleep, eat and ride together. Cantlie is said to have got to know the Princes well during the outback trip that involved crossing more than 70 rivers, with Harry in particular reportedly sharing his passion for motorbikes. The off-road Enduro Africa 2008 bike ride raised money for charities including Sentebale, the organisation to help aids orphans in Lesotho set up by Harry in his mother’s memory. At the time, Cantlie told friends how ‘nice and natural’ the Princes were, acting like ‘one of the lads’. While they have not been in touch since, they are aware of his plight. How the brothers must be feeling for their former companion now. Cantlie was seized in 2012 with American journalist James Foley. Hostage: The British photojournalist makes a gun gesture in this week's IS propaganda video. He was seized in 2012 with American journalist James Foley - the two men were great friends . The pair were great friends and had been on a euphoric high after a daring three-week reporting trip into war-ravaged Syria. So the pair were in good spirits on that day in November 2012 as they prepared to head for home. Along the way they stopped at an internet cafe, where they spent a few hours sending stories, chatting to friends on Skype and sipping cold drinks. Then they hailed a taxi. But as they headed towards safety and the Turkish border, a Hyundai mini-van with blacked out windows raced up alongside and forced the taxi to stop. The men inside were part of an Islamist gang. Their faces covered by masks, they were also armed. After checking the Westerners had paid their taxi driver, the Islamists ordered the two journalists out of the car. Seized: A news blackout about the Cantlie kidnapping has been in place at the request of the British government and his family since he was captured. Above, Cantlie talks directly to camera in the video . They were ordered to kneel on the ground, and their local ‘fixer’ was forced to tie them up. Then Cantlie and Foley were bundled into the Hyundai. The hostage-takers told the Syrian fixer they wanted to take the men ‘for five minutes to ask them a question’. But the journalists never returned. Indeed, they were destined to be passed on or traded to the feared fighters of Islamic State. Ever since that terrifying incident on a dusty Syrian road, a news blackout about the Cantlie kidnapping has been in place at the request of the British government and his family. But the blackout was shattered on Thursday when he was forced to record a bizarre propaganda video, promising to reveal the ‘lies’ told by the Western media about his IS captors. His friend Foley was beheaded by IS in a horrific video released in August. Despite this, Cantlie appeared calm and composed in the new footage, which was released following the beheading of David Haines, a British aid worker, and Steven Sotloff, a US journalist. Although he appeared thinner than before, there were no visible signs of torture or injuries. Composed: Cantlie appeared calm and composed in the new footage, pictured above, which was released following the beheading of David Haines, a British aid worker, and Steven Sotloff, a US journalist . But the Mail can today reveal that the Briton and his fellow hostages have been put through ‘a living hell’, according to security sources with intimate knowledge of their ordeal, and have even been forced to fight with each other for the entertainment of the jihadis. In interviews with security sources and other former hostages, our investigation provides the first detailed account of what happened to Cantlie and the other men. It makes for gruesome reading. After Cantlie and Foley were seized near the border, they were moved from prison to prison by the hostage takers before being passed to IS. The torture began almost immediately, overseen by British jihadists who became known by the hostages as ‘The Beatles’. Both Cantlie and Foley were ‘water boarded’ – an interrogation technique that simulates drowning, in which the victim is strapped down with their mouth and nose covered with cloth, before large quantities of water are poured over their faces. They were also given electric shocks, and shot with Tasers, stun-guns which cause temporary paralysis, after being dragged from their cells to be ‘punished’ for any behaviour their captors deemed a breach of their rules. ‘The water-boarding was not every day – maybe two or three times,’ one source in contact with the foreign hostages told the Mail, adding that the British militants were the most brutal. ‘The British jihadis did the most appalling stuff in the world – they were psychopathic.’ Worse was to come. Four months after Cantlie and Foley were captured, two other westerners – Briton David Haines and an Italian aid worker called Federico Motka – were bundled into the same secret prison inside Syria. By this time, their captors had devised a new and macabre form of torture. The four hostages were forced to take part in boxing matches against each other – like some sick pastiche of the film Fight Club. The losers of these bouts were tortured. According to impeccable sources, Cantlie and Foley were once forced to fight each other. During other barbaric bouts, they were instructed to fight Haines and Motka. These fights, which the hostages dubbed the ‘Royal Rumble’, were held almost entirely for the entertainment of their British captors, one of whom once claimed to have been a boxer in the UK before leaving to join the Islamic jihad. During these forced gladiator-style bouts, the jihadis known as the ‘British Beatles’ watched from a skylight above in order to get a better view of the fighting below. According to sources who have spoken directly to some of the hostages, the men ‘were so exhausted that they didn’t know what they were doing. They couldn’t put any effort into it because they were being tortured so badly’. Tortured: The Briton, above in the propaganda video, and his fellow hostages have been put through ‘a living hell’, according to security sources with intimate knowledge of their ordeal . But the British Islamists, who spoke with London accents, were too enthusiastic in their torture of the hostages for the taste of their fellow jihadis. It is understood they were at one point taken off the job of guarding the Westerners because of their brutality. ‘The British jihadis got into trouble because they were considered to be so brutal,’ the source said. Motka was released earlier this year after a ransom – believed to be about £2.5million – was paid by the Italian government after direct negotiations with his captors. Some 15 other hostages were also released after payments of £30million by European governments, families and insurers. But Britain and America have steadfastly refused to pay any ransom demands for hostages – a stance that prompted Cantlie, in the video released this week, to attack David Cameron. ‘I have been abandoned by my government,’ he said. ‘My fate lies in the hands of the Islamic State. Maybe I will live and maybe I will die. I have nothing to lose.’ He spoke after the brutal murders of three of his fellow prisoners. First, Foley was beheaded in a video which appeared online last month, and which was introduced by a British militant nicknamed ‘Jihadi John’. Two weeks later, Sotloff was killed. David Haines, an aid worker from Scotland, was the next to die. A gruesome video of his beheading was posted online last week. A video of Alan Henning, 47, a former taxi driver from Manchester, was also released this week amid fears that he, too, will be slaughtered. As for Cantlie, his physical condition, despite the hardships and torture over almost two years of captivity, appears to be good. But the mental strain has been huge. ‘There was no Stockholm syndrome,’ said one source, referring to the condition where long-term hostages take on the ideology of their captors. ‘He did not make that video of his own volition.’ His British sense of humour may also have helped him survive this long. ‘The Beatles liked him,’ said the source. ‘They liked his sense of humour. He was in their good books, at least for a while.’ In truth, Cantlie, from Haslemere in Surrey, knew the inherent risks in Syria. An experienced photo-journalist, he had covered the war in Afghanistan and spent five months embedded with US forces. So where is he now? He is believed to have been transported to Raqqa, a dusty Syrian town which is now the headquarters of the Islamic State. Below the streets, there is a sophisticated tunnel network, which terrorists use to move men and weapons around the city. There are also reports that foreign hostages are being held underground. Above ground, fear reigns: anyone caught smoking in public faces a public lashing. Alcohol and other drugs are banned, with miscreants facing death by execution. This, then, is now the city which is the focus of military planners in Britain and America hunting the surviving hostages. Now, as well as air strikes, surveillance drones are constantly flying over the city. Whether they find John Cantlie in time to save his life remains to be seen.","Cantlie joined the Princes on eight-day motorbike ride across South Africa .

"Ringo Starr is disgusted that British jihadis in Syria have been nicknamed 'The Beatles', claiming ISIS is against everything his former band stood for. The nickname was revealed by a former ISIS captive who said the gang of British extremists had been compared to the  group from Liverpool because of their accents.

He said: 'It is possible that the goal was to project the image that a European or a Western person executed an American so that they can showcase their Western members and appeal to others outside Syria and make them feel that they belong to the same cause and that they too can do anything in support of ISIS in their respective countries.' It comes as Prime Minister David Cameron today vowed to 'squeeze' ISIS out of existence and indicated that he may be willing to use the RAF to bomb the terrorist organisation.

"A mysterious ancient creature, resembling both a Neanderthal and a modern human, has been unearthed in China. Fossils dating back 60,000 and 120,000 years have revealed an unknown species that doesn't seem to fit with any known hominin ancestor. Scientists claim one explanation for the remarkable find may be that the fossils were the result of interbreeding between two known species. A mysterious ancient creature, resembling both a Neanderthal and a modern human, has been unearthed in China.  The fossils, discovered in a cave in the Xujiayao site in 1976, are made up of skull fragments. Pictured are three of the teeth shown at different angles . The fossils, discovered in a cave in the Xujiayao site in 1976, are made up of skull fragments, and nine teeth from four individuals. Maria Martinón-Torres of the National Research Centre on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain recently made a new analysis of the teeth. She focused on the size and shape of the crown and root system, as well as the cusps, grooves and their positions relative to each other, according to a report in the BBC. The teeth were then compared to 5,000 other teeth that have been found from other known hominin species. Pictured Xujiayao immature left partial maxilla - or the two bones that form the upper jaw. Rather than being a new species, scientists claim another explanation for the remarkable find may be that the fossils were the result of interbreeding between two known species . Maria Martinón-Torres of the National Research Centre on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain recently made a new analysis of the teeth. She focused on the size and shape of the crown and root system, as well as the cusps, grooves and their positions relative to each other. Pictured is a computer model of the analysis . Europeans may be closer to their Neanderthal cousins than previously thought, research last year suggested. Breeding with Neanderthals has long been known to have left its traces in the DNA of modern Europeans. Scientists in Edinburgh have now confirmed that the genetic similarity between the two must have arisen after interbreeding in Europe and Asia, before our ancestors spread across the globe. Previous research speculated that modern Europeans and Asians are related to Neanderthals because they originated from a similar sub-population in Africa. Both groups evolved from a common ancestor in Africa before spreading to other parts of the world. The two groups emerged at different times with Neanderthals leaving the African continent more than 200,000 years before humans did. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh and Wageningen University found the species mated in Europe and Asia thousands of years ago. 'Each of those slopes, grooves, valleys define a pattern or combination of features that can be distinctive of a population,' Martinón-Torres told Melissa Hogenboom at the BBC. Some of the teeth had features that resembled the older species Homo erectus, while some appeared more Neanderthal. 'They have a mixture of something very primitive, which is currently unknown,' said Professor Martinón-Torres. 'We cannot go further to say it's a new species because we need to compare it to other things.' While modern humans were in Africa, scientists are aware of four groups of early humans living elsewhere on the planet. The Neanderthals lived in Europe, Homo floresiensis in Indonesia, the Denisovans in Asia and the Homo floresiensis in Indonesia. One possibility is that these fossils belong to Denisovans – a mysterious species which co-existed and interbred with our human ancestors. But Darren Curnoe of the University of New South Wales in Sydney says surface features on the teeth strongly suggests a new, unrecognised species, distinct from Denisovans. Researchers are now hoping they will find more bones in other parts of Asia that could help solve the mystery. A separate study published last week suggests there is yet another new primitive human species that may have lived in Asia. The six permanent maxillary teeth of the unknown species. These are the teeth along the top of the human mouth. They rest along the upper jawbone, or maxilla, and have roots that extend into the upper jawbon . The fossils were discovered in a cave in the Xujiayao site of norther China in 1976. The latest study took a fresh look at the evidence to find a mysterious creature that shared traits Neanderthals and human ancestors . While modern humans were in Africa, scientists are aware of four groups of early humans living elsewhere on the planet. The Neanderthals lived in Europe, Homo floresiensis in Indonesia and the Denisovans in Asia and the Homo floresiensis in Indonesia.

Fishermen working off the coast of Taiwan dredged up the jawbone of an ancient human ancestor that lived in the area around 200,000 years ago. The short, thick mandible has unusually large teeth and a strong jaw compared to other human fossils found in East Asia, according to anthropologists. The discovery, like the most recent one in China, suggests that it belonged to an previously unknown ancient human lineage. Experts say it means that there may have been several species of early human living in Asia until modern humans arrived 55,000 years ago. The fossilised jawbone was the first ancient hominin remains to be found in Taiwan. It was dredged up in a fishing net from the Penghu submarine channel, about 15 miles (25km) off the west coast of Taiwan. A separate study published last week suggests there is yet another new primitive human species that may have lived in Asia. Fishermen working off the coast of Taiwan dredged up the jawbone (pictured) an ancient human ancestor that lived in the area around 200,000 years ago. The Penghu mandible (centre) found off the coast of Taiwan is much larger than the lower jawbones of Homo erectus from Java (left) and China (right), despite its much younger age according to the researchers . During the Pliestocene between 2.5 million and 11,000 years ago, periods of low sea level would have meant the area was part of the mainland of Asia. Anthropologists from the National Museum of Natural Science in Taiwan and the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo who studied the newly discovered fossils say it is unlike any of the other fossilised ancient humans that spread through out Asia. Homo erectus, remains of which have been found in Java, Indonesia, and mainland China, tended to have much narrower jawbones and smaller teeth. Researchers say that this suggests the robust-jawed 'Penghu man' had a different evolutionary origin from the 'classic' Homo erectus found in the area. It could mean that it is either an entirely new species or a rare subgroup of Homo erectus. Scientists used CT scanning to create the virtual reconstruction above of the jawbone discovered in Pinghu . This graphic above shows how the Penghu 1 fossil may fit into the complex timeline of human evolution . Dr Yousuke Kaifu, an anthropologist at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo who was involved in the study, told MailOnline: 'It is a well-preserved mandible - a small fragment but contains a lot of information useful to evaluate its evolutionary position. 'What we can say is that it is clearly different from the known Homo erectus populations from northern China and Java, and likely represent a group that has been so far unrecognized so.' He added that the species would have looked very different from modern humans. He said: ''The new Taiwan mandible is markedly different from us in robusticity, not size, of the mandible. 'Width of the bone at the lateral part of the mandible is 20.7 mm (0.8 inches) for Penghu, but on average 14 mm (0.55 inches) for fossil modern humans.' The Penghu Channel (seen above), where the jawbone was found, was once been part of mainland Asia .","The fossils were discovered in a cave in Xujiayao, Northern China .

"British killer: Security experts believe the man ranting on the video has a distinct English accent . Mystery continues to surround the exact identity of the British jihadist believed to be responsible for beheading three innocent hostages, including British aid worker David Haines. Security experts believe the black-robed killer ranting on the video has a distinct English accent, rather than another British person dubbing over the footage. The jihadist wears a black mask, concealing all but his eyes, making it difficult to be sure the voice belonged to him. But audio experts have claimed they are ‘99 per cent’ certain the words were spoken by the man seen on camera. Intelligence sources are understood to have identified the fanatic whose voice is heard on videos of the murders of Mr Haines, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and are trying to track him down in Syria with state-of-the-art military technology. Jihadi John is thought to be one of 500 British Muslims fighting with IS to impose a caliphate in Syria and Iraq. Because of the devastating impact of air strikes on IS positions in northern Iraq, jihadist leaders are increasingly suspicious of Western fighters, amid fears they could be spies pinpointing enemy locations. But Jihadi John’s role in the latest murder suggests he remains a crucial member of the terror network and its propaganda war. Hostages freed earlier this year said the killer was one of three UK-born militants who held captives in Raqqa, Syria – who they nicknamed John, Paul and Ringo after members of The Beatles. Jihadi John is said to be the most intelligent of the trio. He has taken responsibility for communicating with the outside world via negotiations with the prisoners’ families and beheading videos. He also seems to have been in charge of security, reportedly ordering captives to be moved at least ten times to foil attempts to rescue them. Paul and Ringo are thought to have been more junior, but together with Jihadi John they carried out the most sadistic beatings. There were also French-speaking extremists among the guards, including at least one Belgian. But the British jihadists were the most feared because of their gruesome ‘taste for the macabre’, according to a freed French hostage. The violence included beatings, use of Taser guns, and waterboarding – a form of torture where water is poured over a cloth blocking the nose and mouth. Technology can eavesdrop on the jihadis' conversations in places such as their Raqqa stronghold (pictured) They forced some of the Western prisoners to take part in mock killings – US journalist Mr Foley was forced to stand in a crucifix pose. The captives were also mostly kept underground in the dark, often shackled to one another. The first beheading video sent shockwaves across Britain as the killer spoke with a distinctive London twang and English appears to be his first language. Linguistic experts believe the way he pronounced certain words, such as Iraqi place names, suggest he has a foreign language background – indicating his parents or grandparents may have come from the Middle East. He appears to have a skin tone consistent with African, Middle Eastern or South Asian descent. Academics claim Jihadi John has a multicultural East London accent, a kind of ‘new cockney’. The voice patterns will have been studied in painstaking detail by security chiefs desperate to glean his identity and match it with snippets of conversation picked up in Syria. Father of two Alan Henning, a taxi driver from Manchester (pictured at a Syrian aid camp) was paraded at the end of a horrific new video showing the beheading of British hostage David Haines – implying he will be next . Aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment, which can ‘eavesdrop’ on conversations taking place tens of thousands of feet below, are listening to see if they can pick up a voice match – potentially leading them to the location of the terrorist. However, his voice in the latest beheading video appears to be distorted, suggesting IS are trying to disguise it. Experts believe the killer is aged under 30. He is tall and slender, and appears to be left-handed. Experts believe the killer is behind the final e-mail sent to the family of James Foley (pictured) In the third beheading video his feet are not visible – different from footage of him murdering the two Americans when he wears modern desert boots. Ex-captives have described Jihadi John as intelligent, educated and a devout believer in radical Islamic teachings. He is thought to be behind a final email sent to James Foley’s family, dated August 12 – seven days before the journalist was beheaded. In a hate-filled message, the jihadis vowed to kill Mr Foley saying: ‘You [America] and your citizens will pay the price of your bombings! The first of which being the blood of the American citizen James Foley! He will be executed as a direct result of your transgressions towards us!’ Experts said the language, use of capital letters, poor grammar and spelling mistakes supported the belief that the email was written by a working-class militant from Britain. The fanatic has raged against Western foreign policy – in particular US air strikes on IS targets – in rants directed at Barack Obama and David Cameron in his beheading videos. He has referred to recent US attacks, such as the targeting of the Mosul Dam and Haditha Dam in Iraq, to make it clear that the films were shot shortly before their release. Jihadi John also appears to be motivated by a desire to fill IS’s coffers with ransom money, demanding £80million from Mr Foley’s family. European governments are believed to have paid millions of euros to free at least nine hostages held with Mr Haines and the Americans. The militant is said to have called for the release of female Pakistani scientist Aafia Siddiqui, currently held in a US prison, as part of a deal to free Mr Foley.","Security experts believe it is black-robed killer who has English accent .

"A New York man faces spending the rest of his life in prison as his manslaughter trial begins for driving into a taxi carrying a pregnant young couple to the hospital. Julio 'Wemo' Acevedo, 46, is also charged with driving away from the scene of an accident after the crash instantly killed Nachman and Raizel Glauber in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The BMW driver, who went on trial Monday, is thought to have been traveling at 60mph, twice the speed limit, when the incident occurred just after midnight on March 3, 2013. Julio Acevedo (left) 46, faces life in prison if convicted for the deaths of 21-year-olds Nachman and Raizel Glauber (right) Nachman and Raizel Glaubers, who were 7 months pregnant at the time of the crash, were heading to the hospital in this Toyota Camry cab when they were killed . The car the Glaubers were riding in was T-boned by this BMW at an intersection in Williamsburg, Brooklyn . Previous convictions mean Acevedo faces as long as life in prison if he is found guilty,  according to the New York Daily News. The Glaubers, who were married in 2012, were not wearing seat belts when the Toyota Camry they were riding in was T-boned at the intersection of Kent Ave and Wilson Street. Doctors at Bellevue Hospital were able to deliver the 21-year-old Glauber's baby boy, but the child died the next day. The family's Orthodox Jewish community offered a $15,000 award for information leading to the arrest of Acevedo, who left the scene. He was eventually taken into custody four days after the accident, when he surrendered himself to police after arranging to meet them in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Acevedo has a history of felonies, including a 1987 murder conviction that was overturned in 1997 because of new evidence showing that he was under duress when he killed Kevin '50 Cent' Martin, who inspired the name of rapper Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson. He later accepted a plea deal combining a manslaughter charge in the same case with a charge for a robbery he committed 12 days after being released. There are also gun and drug convictions on Acevedo's rap sheet, and he was awaiting an April court date for drunk driving when he hit the Glaubers. Acevedo, pictured after his arrest in 2013, has a long rap sheet including previous convictions for manslaughter as well as gun and drug offences . The rear of the BMW Acevedo, pictured after arrest, was driving included a bag of frozen rats to feed his boa constrictor . The criminal told reporters after his hit-and-run arrest that his illegal speeding was because he was afraid of being shot by someone who pulled out a gun and said, 'Nothing is ever forgotten.' The alleged incident may have been connected to his  killing of  Martin, according to the Daily Beast. Acevedo's lawyer Scott Brettschneider is expected to say that his client fled the scene because of a distrust of authorities stemming from his wrongful murder conviction. It is also predicted that the attorney will claim Acevedo has limited liability for the 2013 accident and that the Glaubers' cab had moved into the intersection when it had a stop sign. The BMW driver has said that he was not going 60mph and had not been drinking before the crash. The Glaubers' cab driver Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32 at the time, sustained minor industries but survived. Mrs Glauber's brother Joseph Silberstein, the first witness in Monday's trial, said that he did not blame Mr Delacruz for the deaths, but rather Acevedo. Prosecutor Tim Gough opened the trial by going through evidence linking the BMW's driver to the accident, including a bag of frozen rats in the car that had the suspect's fingerprints on it, the New York Post reported. The frozen rats were destined for Acevedo's pet boa constrictor.","Julio Acevedo, 46, was driving BMW that hit Nachman and Raizel Glauber .

"Richie Williams, 64 (pictured),  the landlord of the Fur and Feathers in West Derby, Liverpool, died after receiving a fatal punch from Matthew Connah . A landlord was battered to death in a street brawl after a punter insulted him over the quality of his beer, a court heard. Richie Williams, 64, who was the landlord of the Fur and Feathers in West Derby, Liverpool, died after receiving a fatal punch from customer Matthew Connah. The grandfather-of-ten was found unconscious with serious injuries following the attack in the early hours of August 11 and was taken to Aintree University Hospital, where he died a short time later. Connah, 38, today admitted a charge of manslaughter at Liverpool Crown Court after prosecutors dropped a murder charge against him, saying there was 'no realistic prospect of conviction'. John Benson, QC, prosecuting, told the court that the brawl happened a short time after Mr Williams and Connah had shared a drink in his social club. Connah and his friend David Needham had left the club as Mr Williams locked up, but were eventually caught up by the landlord and his friend, Peter Nolan. Mr Benson said: 'Unhappily, the prosecution say, the defendant made some disparaging remarks about the quality of the beer in the premises. 'Mr Williams took umbrage and went over to remonstrate. We can't be entirely clear as to what happened when Mr Williams went over to the defendant but it resulted in the deceased striking the defendant with a blow to the face.' Mr Williams and Mr Nolan walked away but were followed by an 'irate' Connah, who threw a bottle at Mr Williams which missed and smashed on the ground nearby. Mr Benson said: 'He [Connah] was not going to let the matter lie. He equipped himself with what appears to be a chair leg and then approached Mr Williams and Mr Nolan with the chair leg. He was menacing with it and shouting at them. 'He was persisting with his question ""why did you do that?"". Questions which were shouted and overheard by people occupying various properties. 'The defendant approached with the chair leg. Mr Nolan told him to put it down and Mr Williams said ""come on, one-to-one"", and a crucial feature of this case is that the defendant did put the chair leg down. 'Then both men, the defendant and the deceased, met in the middle of the road and traded blows. 'The deceased struck a blow to the defendant and the defendant went to the floor. The defendant got up and struck a blow which put the deceased on the floor. 'Mr Williams wilted. He was an older man than the defendant. The defendant is a stronger, taller man. The altercation occurred outside the Fur and Feathers Bar in Liverpool (pictured) on August 11. Connah, 38, today admitted a charge of manslaughter at Liverpool Crown Court and will be sentenced on February 18 . 'At the end of that altercation there was a flurry of very heavy blows delivered by the defendant.' Mr Williams collapsed on the floor as Connah left the scene, telling him 'don't come around to my house in the morning.' Mr Benson said that was an indication that Connah did not know he had delivered a fatal blow. 'In the circumstances the prosecution has taken a view that it would be appropriate in all the circumstances to accept the defendant's plea of guilty to manslaughter,' he said. He told Mr Justice Edis that Mr Williams' grieving family were 'entirely understanding' of the decision not to proceed with the murder charge. Connah, of Liverpool, was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on February 18.","Landlord Richie Williams, 64, died from fatal punch following altercation .

"The British aid worker threatened with beheading by Islamic militants in Syria has been so desperately ill that his captors have been forced to summon a doctor to treat him. Father-of-two David Haines has been struggling to hold down food and suffering from acute gastric and other health problems in his cramped captivity. The revelation will add to the anguish of his desperate family after Islamic State fanatics named him as the next hostage to be murdered. Scroll down for video . Family man: David Haines with his wife Dragana and their daughter Athea. It has been revealed that the hostage is struggling to hold down food and is suffering from other health problems in his cramped captivity . ‘He cannot digest food and has serious digestive problems,’ said one well-connected source. ‘Haines has suffered a good deal from vomiting, diarrhoea and gastro-intestinal problems. A doctor on at least once occasion was brought in for him because he was so very sick.’ A special investigation by The Mail on Sunday can also reveal: . The disclosure that Haines, 44, has been suffering physical difficulties alongside inevitable mental turmoil must have added to the distress of his wife Dragana, who lives in Croatia with their four-year-old daughter, and family in Scotland during their agonising wait for news. A security source familiar with the cases described the hostages’ internment as a ‘living hell’. Mr Haines, originally from Perth in Scotland, has been badly tortured, especially during the first six months after his abduction in March last year at a refugee camp in northern Syria. The father-of-two has been severely tortured and given electric shock ‘punishments’ with Tasers by the group of British jihadis led by ‘Jihadi John’ and nicknamed The Beatles . He may have been singled out for such brutal treatment because of his nationality. One freed hostage said guards talked often about the 2003 invasion of Iraq. IS videos show British and US captives dressed in orange jumpsuits, a clear reference to prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The most recent video showed a gaunt Haines held by the collar as a black-clad, English extremist warned Britain to abandon ‘this evil alliance of America’. Mr Haines has been given electric shocks with Tasers as ‘punishments’ by a group that included at least one of ‘The Beatles’, the British jihadis linked to the kidnap and killing of James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Like other hostages, the Briton has been moved repeatedly because of chaotic infighting among Syrian rebels and possibly to evade raids from special forces. At one point he was held with Foley and Sotloff and some of the 15 Europeans who have been released after ransoms were paid. Mr Haines was working for French aid group Acted (Agency for Technical Co-operation and Development) when he was grabbed within sight of the Turkish border. It is understood he had time to notify his superiors but could not escape. He had worked for aid agencies in South Sudan, Libya, and the former Yugoslavia. Adrien Tomarchio, spokesman for Acted, said he was hired for his experience working in war zones: ‘He had only been employed by us for ten days when he went missing. David went to Syria to help Syrians, to help the vulnerable.’ The disclosure that Haines, 44, has been suffering physical difficulties alongside inevitable mental turmoil must have added to the distress of his wife Dragana (pictured on their wedding day), who lives in Croatia . He was kidnapped by an Islamist gang with Federico Motka, an Italian-Swiss aid worker freed four months ago after a ransom was paid. A Syrian intermediary said $4 million (£2.5 million) was handed over by Italian officials after lengthy negotiations involving intelligence agencies. The country’s foreign minister admitted there had been ‘complex and delicate’ work to get Motka freed. Exactly the same sum was paid by the Italian authorities last September to free a journalist held by a rogue brigade of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). Rome is working to secure the release of two young female aid workers, thought to have been abducted by a criminal gang, with officials currently on the Turkish border. According to a security source, £31.7 million has been paid over the past 12 months by Western governments, families and insurers to free aid workers and reporters. David Cameron rounded on fellow world leaders at the Nato summit last week, urging them not to given in to ransom demands. ‘It is utterly self-defeating,’ he said. But a friend of Dragana Haines yesterday criticised the British authorities for refusing to pay ransoms: ‘If he was from Italy or France they would pay and he would be back with his beautiful wife and their child. The UK and America won’t pay ransoms so they are letting an innocent man die.’ In a separate case, a Turkish journalist has revealed one of his captors was a young white English-speaker, almost certainly from Britain. Although there are thought to be some 500 militants from this country in Syria and Iraq, those known about have been almost exclusively from ethnic minority backgrounds. A friend of his wife Dragana, the mother of his child Athea, has criticised the British government for not paying ransoms for the return of hostages . The brown-eyed militant was aged about 24, of slight build, 5ft 6in tall and growing a wispy beard. He was guarding Bunyamin Aygun, a photojournalist seized last November while investigating massacres in Syria.Aygun said the English-speaking jihadi demanded his computer and social media passwords and ‘kept asking if I was working for the CIA or Mossad’. He could not be completely certain the man was British, ‘but it was definitely not American-English,’ he said , adding that, unusually, this guard never spoke in Arabic. Others spoke sometimes in broken English. Aygun, captured for 40 days before being freed by a rival militia working with Turkish intelligence agency MIT, is the first foreign journalist to speak openly about being held hostage by IS fanatics. He endured endless interrogations and was sentenced to death at one point. ‘It was the worst feeling of despair you can have to know you are going to your death,’ he said. He was moved every four days, usually in the boot of a car, and held hooded and handcuffed in basements, houses and ‘a metal enclosure’. Militants in black balaclavas bombarded him with questions, asking him if he was spy, making him pray five times a day and mocking him because his name reminded them of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Aygun was seized with a commander of the FSA in the town of Salkin by IS fighters. In his first prison, a fellow Syrian hostage warned him: ‘Tell them the truth. You’re not even worth the value of a chicken to them.’ His worst moment came three days later when four fighters gave him a copy of the Koran and warned he had been sentenced to death. ‘You Turks are pro-Israel, not proper Muslims, so we are going to execute you,’ they said. The man who told him was a Turk who had spent ten years fighting with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. ‘I was paralysed with fear,’ Aygun said. ‘I needed to find a way to be shot rather than beheaded.’ He was forced to wait two days for his death, the lowest point in his ordeal. But on the day his execution was due, none of his captors turned up . They finally arrived bearing the body of the Turkish fighter, who had been shot in battle. The aid worker had been employed by his French charity for just ten days when seized in northern Syrian within sight of the Turkish border . The militants – who included Turks from Germany – asked him if he wanted to smell his fellow Turk’s blood. ‘The blood of martyrs smells good,’ they said. After 17 days in captivity his kidnappers decided Aygun was telling the truth and stopped the barrage of questions. For his final few days he was held with some Syrians. He said this move was influenced by stories in the Turkish media, which confirmed he was a journalist and not a spy. ‘They follow reports on the internet very closely.’ As a result he believes media ‘blackouts’ – as requested by the British Government – can backfire, while pointing out they also relieve pressure on officials to save those being held. The Foreign Office has revealed Britain has paid £500,000 to a security agency based in a secret European location to bring war crimes charges against leaders of IS using information smuggled out of the organisation. A spokesman told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The United Kingdom has a long-standing commitment to ensuring that those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria are held to account. As part of that we are funding the investigation of atrocities carried out by Isil.’ Meanwhile, family and friends of Mr Haines are rallying around his 17-year-old daughter Bethany, comforting her with long walks in the Perthshire countryside near where she lives with Haines’s first wife in Scone. One close family friend said: ‘It’s been very difficult for them. ‘They are a very close family – that is how they are getting through this.’ Bethany referred to the terrifying situation facing her father with a series of heartbreaking messages on social media. She described him as ‘my hero’ and said she would do anything to have him ‘home for good’.

The Illinois Department of Transportation dispatched 350 trucks to clear and salt Chicago-area roadways ahead of Monday's morning rush hour, and the city said late Sunday that it was sending out 150 more pieces of heavy equipment for road work. The snowstorm is delaying two of the nation's biggest court cases - the murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez and jury selection in the federal death penalty trial of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Proceedings were expected to resume on Tuesday. Across the country, hundreds of public schools canceled classes due to the danger of children traveling. Many parochial schools and colleges did the same. The weather led to power outages, including roughly 10,000 ComEd customers in Illinois on Sunday evening. That number had been cut to 5,500 by midnight. The weather also cut power to nearly 8,000 northern Indiana homes and businesses. Ohio officials said a Toledo police officer died while shoveling snow in his driveway Sunday and the city's 70-year-old mayor was hospitalized after an accident while he was out checking road conditions. The officer, who was not named, died of an apparent heart attack. City and medical officials say Mayor D. Michael Collins was hospitalized after he had a heart attack and his SUV crashed into a pole.

"Northern Territory police have seized a number of vehicles under the state's tough anti-hooning laws. Tennant Creek police have seized a V8 Holden Commodore utility after several reports were received of it hooning on Bornite Street and Scheelite Crescent on Saturday night. The vehicle has been seized for a mandatory 48 hours. Under the anti-hooning legislation, anyone caught doing burnouts, donuts, drifting or other hooning behaviour could lose their vehicles, slapped with hefty fines or face 12 months imprisonment. This Holden utility was seized by police for Hooning in Tennant Creek on Sunday . Territory Duty Superintendent Helen Braam said 'hooning is a selfish and irresponsible act. 'Deliberately losing control of your vehicle - which is what you do when you fishtail around corners - places members of the public and their property in great danger, not to mention the damage to the roadway, that our taxes pay to repair!!' Superintendent Braam said. 'The old advertisment where people would wiggle their pinkies indicating the size of a males anatomy always comes to mind when people are found hooning, obviously only relevant where the driver is a male - which it's believed was the case in this instance.' 'Once again, it's an offence to hoon – it's an offence to refuse to disclose the driver of a vehicle if it's registered to you - basically just do the right thing - it's one matter to disregard your own safety - but entirely a different matter when you disregard the safety of others.'

It follows after a 28-year-old male driver was caught allegedly doing a burnout while fishtailing his car sideways with smoke pouring from the rear tyres – all in front of four police officers. The hooning act occurred around 2.45pm on Friday on Berrimah Road. Northern Territory police have taken to their Facebook page to post confiscated vehicles and describing the act as 'selfish' after motorists were caught driving illegally. The posts have received a significant amount of shares and comments. 'Best they seize the car BEFORE the hoon driver goes on to KILL HIMSELF OR OTHER INNOCENT PEOPLE who might just happen to be in his way!' one woman wrote. 'Should have had the car crushed!' another said. 'They should have it [car] crush and not just a word this way owners who commit this act would think twice about it.' one wrote. The Northern Territory Government is getting hoons off our streets. New anti-hooning laws mean that if you're caught hooning on Territory roads and in public places you could lose your car and your cash. First Offence: Police can immediately impound your car for 48 hours every time you are detected hooning and you can be fined $220. If you are caught hooning again within a two year period: . Second Offence: The court can impound your car for a further period of between three to six months and you can receive a fine of up to $2200 or 12 months imprisonment. Third offence: The court can forfeit and dispose of your vehicle and you can also receive a fine of up to $2200 or 12 months imprisonment.

The video, called 'Surviving an Active Shooter,' was uploaded to YouTube on Thursday. The PSA shows blood spurting and multiple victims left on the ground in a variety of mass shootings. Bystanders are seen using several different survival methods. 'This nine minute video presentation, which has been in production for nearly two years, is one of the most ambitious projects the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s Video Production Unit (VPU) has ever produced,' a release from the LASD says. Scroll down for video . Terror: A masked gunman enters a food court and opens fire at patrons in one of the PSA scenarios . Shock: A man who was eating with a woman before the gunman entered convinces her that he will lead them to safety and away from the scene . Flee: The couple stay low and duck near rows of chairs in order to get out. A female victim is seen lying in front of them with a pool of blood . It continues, 'The video presentation features three vignettes inspired by true life events and introduces the viewer to concepts such as: cover and concealment, location awareness, and self-defense.' In one, a man and a woman eat food together in a mall food court when a shooter wearing a skeleton mask on the bottom half of his face opens fire, striking several people. The couple are able to flee because they duck low and conceal themselves behind objects during their escape. The man gestures to others nearby to follow through a hallway. Eventually, the couple and others at the scene get out of the building and see police officers. The video's voice-over narration encourages victims to use cover as they attempt to run - and notes that kitchens and stock rooms often have exits to use. Another shooter situation in the PSA takes place at a school. At the start, a man sits on a park bench before getting the attention of the person sitting next to him - only to shoot him dead. The gunman soon heads into the library and lets bullets fly. Attack: The shooter sits on a bench and gets the attention of the man sitting next to him, before opening fire . Aid: The shooter later enters a library, where he shoots a female patron. The woman is led away by another bystander into an elevator . Follow the plan: The two women eventually get to a classroom and let others know what is going on. A female instructor (center in pink) tells her students to follow a safety drill . Strategy: Doors are locked and barricaded where possible as the group hides together in a corner . Approach: Police enter the school looking for the shooter. Eventually they surround him and he shoots himself . A female library patron warns a woman coming out of the elevator onto the floor to go back inside. The female patron runs to flee as well - but is shot in the leg by the shooter. The PSA encourages people to tend to the injured as long as it doesn't leave them vulnerable to unwarranted danger. The two women are able to flee into a classroom, and tell the students and instructor what is going on. The female teacher locks one classroom door, gets her students to barricade a door which cannot be locked with desks. She tells the class to huddle together in a corner out of sight and assist the injured woman. The PSA encourages locking doors and turning off lights where possible - and also warns viewers to turn off cell phone volume. The shooter later walks through a nearby computer lab, where he is confronted by police and shoots himself. Authorities later knock on the classroom door, and the woman passes a casualty card under the door, indicating someone is hurt inside. Tense: A male employee is seen in a verbal dispute with a woman at a warehouse . Violence: After he is laid off, the man kills the women then exits the office . Casualties: The man soon opens fire on other employees present . Stuck: A warehouse employee is unable to get out or take shelter, so he grabs a fire extinguisher for self-defense against the shooter . Strike back: The man is able to use the fire extinguisher and get the shooter's gun on the ground . A different shooter situation shows a warehouse employee being fired before quickly turning a gun on his employer and killing her in an office. He then walks out into an open area and shoots multiple people. One employee is left stuck with no way to escape the warehouse and nowhere to hide. The video's narration warns that self-defense may be necessary in that situation. The man grabs a fire extinguisher, waits for the shooter to approach, then sprays it in his face. Disoriented, the gunman falls with his weapon to the ground. Authorities quickly arrive. Video producer Sgt. Harry Drucker told KABC 'We wanted to make it realistic. We wanted to affect people's emotions because that's how people remember things.' He also told the television station 'What we wanted to do was have a variety of locations that people could see themselves in or places that they have been. Everybody goes to a mall. Everbody goes to a library or school.' Sheriff Jim McDonnell told KABC 'Whatever the venue you're going to is a potential site for one of these incidents. You can't rule out that it will happen this trip to the mall, this trip to the supermarket, and you need to be prepared.'","A new PSA warns people what to do in active shooter situations .

"President Barack Obama's 2016 budget proposal is as silly as a comedy sketch, a Senate leadership aide told Daily Mail Online on Monday. 'This $4 trillion budget is the silliest thing since Monty Python,' the senior staffer said, recalling the British funnymen's 'Ministry of silly walks' routine. 'The only think about it that isn't funny is that the president thinks it's serious.' There was no shortage of budgetary body-slams on Capitol HIll as the GOP panned the White House's dramatic budget, which another Senate aide officially declared 'DOA – that's Dead On Arrival.' Scroll down for video . SILLY STUFF: Congressional Republican aides called Obama's budget 'bizarre,' 'ridiculous' and 'dead on arrival' Obama plugged his $4 trillion budget for 2016 during a speech to Homeland Security staffers in Washington . He castigated the White House for rolling a 'union make-work jobs' proposal into the budget, citing a $478 billion public works program that promises to repair crumbling highways, bridges and public transit systems.' Programs like that typically benefit Democrats' powerful labor union constituency. Both aides spoke on condition of anonymity so they could reflect what the first one called 'the true mood up here on the Hill.' 'It's bizarre and ridiculous, rolled up in a package of idiotic,' he said. Republican lawmakers who spoke on the record were more circumspect but equally dismissive. 'This proposal isn't really a budget at all – it is a messaging piece,' said Tennessee Rep. Diane Black. 'This so-called budget ignores both the reality of our already crippling $18 trillion national debt and of a new Republican majority in Washington that will not allow this laughable tax-and-spend proposal to pass.' 'Ministry of Silly Walks' – Monty Pythons's Flying Circus . Black claimed that the president's proposal adds a whopping ''$2.1 trillion in new tax increases, on top of $1.7 trillion in tax hikes already imposed by the administration.' Those tax hikes, totaled over ten years, wouldn't balance Obama's budget in 2016, however, as it still leaves a $474 billion deficit. 'President Obama likes to talk about his veto pen,' Indiana Sen. Dan Coats told Politico, 'and with the release of this budget, we can only conclude that he writes with red ink.' The budget's tax rate on capital gains – investment income – would be the highest in 19 years. Obama is demanding a 7 per cent increase in domestic spending and the defense budget, undoing the fiscal restraint that marked the 2011 budget deal. Obama called those cuts 'mindless austerity.' Rep. Diane Black, shown Jan. 27 during a House Budget Committee hearing, said Obama's budget is a 'laughable tax-and-spend proposal' Sen. Dan Coatas (left) said Obama's legendary veto pen 'writes with red ink,' while Rep. Scott Garrett (right) joked about Groundhog Day and recurring unbalanced budgets . New Jersey Rep. Scott Garrett said in a statement that 'it's fitting that President Obama released his budget on Groundhog Day because it's a painful repeat of the same failed policies that he has presented to Congress for the past six years.' That's a reference to the Bill Murray movie, in which he is forced to relive the same day over and over again. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader of the upper house of Congress, summed up the GOP's complaints. 'What we saw this morning was another top-down, backward-looking document that caters to powerful political bosses on the Left and never balances – ever.' Republicans now control both houses of COnrgess for the first time in Obama's presidency. Asked to say something nice about the hefty budget book that arrived to great fanfare on Capitol Hill this morning, one House committee staffer said: 'It's still winter, so my fireplace will like it.'","GOP lawmakers and their aides lashed out on Monday after Obama sent his 2016 budget request to Capitol Hill .

"Voters should scribble a rude word on their ballot paper if there is no candidate who represents their views, Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said today. Miss Bennett said people should register to vote and cast their ballot rather than stay at home, even if they do not intend to back someone standing in their constituency. She said: 'I would like you to vote Green, I would like you to vote for someone you believe in. But If there is no one on the ballot paper who you think represents your views, still go to the polling station and if you want to write a rude word on the ballot paper.' Scroll down for video . Natalie Bennett said people should register to vote and cast their ballot rather than stay at home, even if they do not intend to back someone standing in their constituency . The Green leader called for a major boost in turnout following the Scottish independence referendum last year when more than eight out of 10 voters cast their ballot. She said: 'If people did that, people went out and voted, voted for what they believe in - whatever that is - we could actually have a peaceful political revolution.' Miss Bennett made the comments at an Ask The Leaders event hosted by Sky News' and Facebook's this morning. She said people should not vote tactically but should back the party that best represents their views. 'Because if you don't vote, if you don't turn up, if you don't register, you are counted with the ""I'm happy enough with how things are"" part of the group, and I don't think most people actually are,' she said. The first-past-the-post system used in Westminster elections had trained people to 'vote very often for the person or party we dislike the second most to stop the people we really hate getting in', she said. The Green leader said: 'If there is no one on the ballot paper who you think represents your views, still go to the polling station and if you want to write a rude word on the ballot paper' A surge in support for the Green party could cost Labour 22 seats, a polling expert has warned. The Greens have been boosted by a row over TV election debates, with David Cameron refusing to take part if the Greens were excluded. Labour fears it could lose vital left wing votes to the smaller party, including former Lib Dem supporters. Robert Ford of the University of Manchester, carried out analusis of local election results 2010. It found 22 marginal seats Labour needs to win or cling on to where more than 10 per cent of voters are identified as being Labour/Green-inclined. It includes Lib Dem strongholds such as of Bristol West, Norwich South and Cambridge, Tory-held Hove, and Brighton Kemptown, and Labour-held Birmingham Edgbaston and Tooting. Mr Ford told The Observer: 'The voters fuelling the Green boom share one characteristic with supporters of the Ukip and SNP insurgencies – a deep-seated disaffection with the political establishment. 'Besides the general problem of disaffection, Labour also faces a specific problem with the Greens into political competition. 'Young, highly educated, cosmopolitan liberal idealists, Greens are more or less the polar opposite to Ukip's ageing, socially conservative, nationalist electorate. Labour is losing votes to both, but any policy that appeals to one pole will anger those at the other.' Miss Bennett said: 'That's actually given us the kind of politics we have now. What we have done is we have seen, particularly the two largest parties, focus all their policies on the swing voters in the swing seats. They have ignored their core vote, they have ignored the whole issue of what's best for the country, but thought 'what do we say to get those swing voters?'. 'If voters keep voting the same way, you will keep getting the same politics.' The Greens have received a boost in the polls over recent months, and Ms Bennett has been invited to appear in televised leaders' debates ahead of the general election. But that has led to increased scrutiny about some of the party's policies - including whether a ban on people joining terrorist groups including al Qaida and Islamic State should be lifted. Green Party policy states ''it should not be a crime simply to belong to an organisation or have sympathy with its aims, though it should be a crime to aid and abet criminal acts or deliberately fund such acts''. On BBC One's Sunday Politics earlier this month, asked if that meant it would be allowed to be a member of al Qaeda or IS, she said: ''Exactly. What we want to do is make sure we are not punishing people for what they think or what they believe.' Challenged about her views during the question and answer session on Sky News she appeared to indicated that membership of IS or al Qaeda would be illegal because of their support for violence. She said: 'Obviously IS and al Qaeda are hideous terrorist organisations that advocate and support violence. If you are involved in them, support them in any way, then you are participating in inciting violence, that's a crime, rightly, and should be pursued to the full extent of the law.' Ms Bennett said she does not support compulsory voting, because 'it suggests that voters are the problem'. 'I think, actually, politics is the problem,' she said. 'It's up to politicians to make politics exciting and involving and make people think it's worth voting.' The Green leader said she traced her political philosophy back to her early childhood. 'I became a feminist at age five,' she said. 'I didn't know the word then, but at age five I was told 'Because you're a girl, you are not allowed to have a bicycle' and I thought 'That's not fair or reasonable'. 'That sense of fairness and the sense that so many people are stopped from realising their potential and doing what they want to do because of unfair rules and society imposing restrictions on them - that's what drives me.' Ms Bennett won some applause from her young audience when she said that people need to 'stop blaming immigrants' for problems with low wages, housing and pressure on public services, which she said were down to Government failures. She called for a higher minimum wage, devolution of political power to local regions, the scrapping of the planned HS2 rail link, a cap on private rents, the end of the right to buy council houses and the renationalisation of the railways. And she said that the unpaid internships offered to many young workers were 'unfair and unreasonable and shouldn't happen'. 'We have a minimum wage that is not enforced,' said Ms Bennett. 'If you have a contract with a company that says you are going to turn up nine-to-five for six months, that is a job and it should be covered by the minimum wage.'","Green leader said all voters should go to the polling station this election .

'I never would have thought it would come to her trying to kill her sister though.' 'They were always immaculately groomed and polite, and as alike as two peas in a pod. I never knew which one was passing me in the corridor but they always said hello. She said that she did not often see the two girls together although they lived at the same address, and thought that despite the fact they were identical twins there was an element of jealousy between the two over who was the more attractive.

"Newly-single Kelly Brook made the headlines again this weekend, following reports that she has already found comfort in the arms of a new man. The TV star is said to be dating James Lee Taylor, 30, after meeting him on the set of a Skechers advert last November. The Essex model is just latest in a long line of romances for Kelly, 35, who has jumped from relationship to relationship increasingly quickly over the past decade and a half. Scroll down for video . Kelly Brook posed for a selfie  with model James Lee Taylor who she's rumoured to have enjoyed dates . Despite her jaw-dropping looks, a wicked sense of humour, independent wealth and a strong work ethic, Kelly has struggled to find a man to settle down with. Those closest to the brunette describe her as loyal, down-to-earth and largely unconcerned with the dazzling beauty that made her a household name. So why has such a good catch so far failed to find the love that she has been searching for? Kelly said herself of her failed relationship history recently: 'They've all been on their a***s when I met them, they didn't have a career or they were at the end of one career and trying to start something else. 'I met them all at a not very good time for them and that's my fault for being nurturing, for being like Mary Poppins. 'They were all either in debt, or had no job, or they were figuring out what to do.' Relationship expert Tracey Cox said: 'Some people continually and repeatedly choose partners with problems. Women are particularly good at playing rescuer (a lost puppy brings out all those maternal, look-after-him instincts), but both sexes are guilty of it. 'Rescuers are attracted to people they can help. 'They become saviours, putting their life completely on hold while they rescue their lover, cheerfully giving up work, friends and family to be at the beck and call of a person who often doesn’t deserve such loyalty. 'Why the need to play doctor and shrink? Because rescuers truly believe that if they love enough, give enough and do enough, they’ll save their lover from their problem. 'You’ve learnt to equate love with being needed. In order to feel loved you have to nurture and solve problems.' FEMAIL looks back over Kelly's past men, to see where she went wrong: . Kelly and action star Jason Statham were childhood sweethearts and dated for seven years . Jason Statham 1998-2004: . Kelly started dating Jason Statham when she was just 18 years old and he was 30. He spotted her while she was on a modelling job on the Greek island of Santorini and later claimed it was love at first sight. At the time, Jason was making the big step from professional diver to Hollywood actor, via part-time model, after appearing in Guy Richtie's movie Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels. The couple were so serious that they moved into a flat in Sydenham, south London, and later emigrated to America where they shared a house in LA. Jason wasn't the only once to enjoy some career success - Kelly also gained some small parts in television show Smallville and the remake of The Italian Job. The couple were soon engaged to be married and were regularly referenced to as one of the strongest couples in showbusiness. But by 2004, the relationship had hit the rocks and Kelly dumped Jason, replacing him with the Hollywood actor Billy Zane. She said at the time: 'I wasn't happy. I'd been with Jason since I was very young and I knew I needed to branch out on my own. 'It just so happened there was somebody else there, but it would have occurred anyway.' She claimed recently that Jason was on a break from his girlfriend Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in 2013, when she split with Danny Cipriani, and he rang to tell her that he still loved her. She said: 'Jason called out of the blue and said, ""I still love you so much,"" and I said ""I still love you."" We'll always still love each other. 'I know that for many years afterwards (the split) he wasn't happy. Neither of us were.' Kelly and US actor Billy Zane, who starred in Titanic, were together for four years . Billy Zane 2004- 2008: . Kelly wasted no time after her split from Jason Statham, moving straight on to the Hollywood actor Billy Zane, who was by then a global star thanks to his role in the Nineties blockbuster Titanic. The couple appeared to be blissfully happy together for a few years and Billy proposed to his young girlfriend with a ring said to be worth £35,000. But the happiness wasn't to last - in 2008, the couple split and Kelly moved back to the UK. At the time, the break-up was blamed on Kelly's desire to spend more time in Britain, but in 2013, she revealed that the actor was too controlling. She said: '(He) wanted me either to look like a 1960s Bond girl or a 1950s housewife. That's how he saw me. 'I felt I had to find out who I was and what my own style was anyway, but it was controlling. 'He projected all his fantasies on to me. I never had a real life with him. I was always in a fantasy fairy tale.' First time around, Kelly and rugby player Danny Cipriani dated for 22 months . Danny Cipriani 2008- 2010: . Kelly didn't say single for long after her split from Billy Zane. No sooner had she moved back to the UK than she was in the arms of Danny Cipriani, then 20, who at that time was a little-known rugby player for the London Wasps. The couple had a tempestuous relationship that was rocked by rumours of infidelity and eventually ended 22 months later, when Danny relocated to Australia to try to resurrect his dwindling rugby career. Unable to maintain her TV work down under, Kelly stayed in the UK and soon afterwards started dating Danny's friend Thom Evans. After Danny, Kelly dated another rugby player, Thom Evans, for two years . Thom Evans 2010-2012: . Kelly and Thom announced their relationship in December 2010 after  dating in secret for a couple of months. He appeared to be a stable influence in Kelly's life, who enjoyed nights at home instead of flashy film premieres and celebrity parties. The couple conceived a daughter in 2011 but sadly Kelly suffered from a miscarriage. Desperate to keep their relationship on track, Thom proposed and the couple tried for a second child but Kelly miscarried once again. She told The Sun last year: '(After the first miscarriage) I went to see my doctor, who said, ""The best way to get over this is to try and get pregnant again."" 'So Thom and I weren't careful, and just before Christmas 2011, I got pregnant again. 'The look on Thom's face said it all. I think he was terrified ... I had another miscarriage after a few weeks.' The couple were unable to overcome the second tragedy though and split in 2012. Kelly and Danny's second attempt at a relationship lasted just seven months . Danny Cipriani 2013: . Just a few weeks after Kelly split with Thom, she re-started her relationship with Danny Cipriani, who was by then back in the UK with the Manchester-based club Sale Sharks. The couple dated for seven months, regularly posting affectionate pictures of themselves in exotic locations, before splitting in August 2013, following reports that Danny had cheated on Kelly. She said afterwards of the relationship: 'He wasn't funny or intelligent. 'His only chat up line was ""You're the one. I've never felt like this. I want to have your babies."" 'Except two weeks later he's saying it to the next one.' Kelly started dating David McIntosh, a.k.a ex-Gladiator Tornado, last January . David McIntosh 2014: . Kelly started dating David McIntosh, aka ex-Gladiator Tornado, last January after meeting him at a New Year's party in her London bar, Steam & Rye. Just 12 weeks later, the model announced on Twitter that the bodybuilder had proposed - and she had accepted. But just as soon as their relationship started, it was over. The couple split in September following reports that David had cheated on her with his former girlfriend Sarah Harper behind her back. After  some serious wooing by David, Kelly relented and they dated again for another couple of months, before splitting again in November following more allegations of cheating. She said at the time: 'Maybe it’s not my time to find love at the moment. I just get to focus on myself. There are more important things in the world.'","Model Kelly Brook, 35, has struggled to find lasting love .

"A mayor in Wisconsin has learned a valuable lesson about his city's weather-predicting critter: Don't get too close. Jimmy, the official groundhog in Sun Prairie, bit the mayor's left ear during the 67th Groundhog Day celebration on Monday.

Caught on camera: A handler was holding the rodent next to 41-year-old Jonathan Freund's face when it promptly launched an attack . However, he swiftly recovers from the nip and announces to crowds gathered that Jimmy had predicted an early spring with freezing temperatures set to lift. Despite the aggressive turn of events, spectators delighted in meeting the feisty animal. Stephen Peterson, a local resident, said: 'It was pretty cool. [Jimmy] looked a little aggressive but he's excited for spring.' WISC-TV reports that the Groundhog Day celebration got even more precarious when Jimmy's handlers, Jerry and Maria Hahn, said the mayor had got the forecast wrong and there would be six more weeks of winter. Then the city later issued a statement saying only the mayor can translate Jimmy's prediction. Close encounter: Sun Prairie Mayor Jonathan Freund, left, leans in for Jimmy's prognostication just before being bitten on ear by the groundhog during the Groundhog - the critter's handler, Jerry Hahn, is seen right . The Hahns said it Mayor Freund's first time participating in the Groundhog Day celebration, which could have contributed to the confusion. A German legend has it that if a furry rodent sees his shadow on February 2, winter will last another six weeks. If not, spring comes early. Jimmy is the 11th in a long line of groundhogs in the state of Wisconsin. This year marked his first time in front of a crowd. He rode to the event with his caretakers in a limousine escorted by Sun Prairie firefighters. It marked the Hahn's last year as groundhog handlers. They said they had loved their time as caretakers and hoped the tradition continues for years to come.","Jimmy, the official groundhog in Sun Prairie, bit the mayor's ear during the 67th Groundhog Day celebration on Monday .

"For most people, winning the lottery means living the rest of their lives in the lap of luxury. But for Sue Herdman - who won £1.2million - splashing the cash on designer clothes and sipping champagne all day wasn’t for her. Instead, the mother-of-one decided to become a pig farmer - and, although she is up at the crack of dawn and often knee-deep in mud, she has never been happier. Cradling a piglet Sue, 46, said: 'Winning the lottery was amazing but the first time I brought a piglet into the world, I felt I’d hit the Jackpot. Sue Herdman won £1.2million on the lottery but decided to become a pig farmer rather than lead a lavish life . 'Friends think I’m crazy. It’s a dirty seven-day job in all weathers. Some of the piglets need 24-hour attention and there are days when I only manage to get a few hours sleep. But the pigs bring me more satisfaction than any money ever could.' Before her numbers came up in January 2010, Sue was a hairdresser in the village of Eardisley, near Hereford. She said: 'Then although I struggled financially I was perfectly groomed - my clothes and make up were always carefully picked out. 'Now I always smell of pigs and ironically these days I buy most of my clothes from second-hand charity shops.' A typical day for Sue begins at 6.30am when she gets up with partner Andrew Hornshaw, 47, to tend the 7,000 pigs on his family farm near Borough Bridgek North Yorkshire. When Sue won the lottery in 2010, she was a hairdresser but decided to become a pig farmer with her partner . Sue, who has invested her winnings in property, added: 'I always imagined if I won the lottery I'd buy a new car and clothes. But the reality is I still love hunting for bargains - and I’ve discovered I love pigs' She said: 'Every three weeks around 1,000 new piglets are born. Some of them need bottle feeding hourly to survive. So it’s often midnight before I sink into bed. 'It’s definitely not the usual life of a millionaire lottery winner and if you’d told me before I won the lottery this was how I’d spend my days, I would have said, ""no way"".' Sue was a single mother desperately trying to save up enough money to get a mortgage when her numbers came up. 'It was teatime and I was just about to have dinner when I glanced at the TV and saw the winning numbers,' she recalls, 'they looked familiar - I always used the same ones - and I got my ticket out to check. 'To say I couldn’t believe my eyes is an understatement but I suddenly couldn’t eat a thing.' After verifying she had indeed won £1,182,714, she celebrated with a drink in the pub and some karaoke. Sue was a single mother desperately trying to save up enough money to get a mortgage when her numbers came up - now she's penned a book, too . 'All I could think of was that I no longer had to fret about whether I’d get a mortgage as I didn’t need one,' she said.. In fact, it wasn’t a total surprise to friends as just weeks before Sue had posted on Facebook that she was sure she was going to win the lottery. 'A few weeks earlier I was at a party when I had my tarot cards done for fun. After the last card was revealed she actually told me the world was my oyster. All my dreams were within reach and I should buy a lottery ticket. 'A few weeks later I met her again and she made the same prediction. She was so sure I would win soon that I believed her and made sure I bought a ticket every week.' Even so, at first she couldn't come to terms with her win. 'Most lottery winners take a holiday but for the first six months I just kept on going to work at my hairdressing salon as normal.' Nine months before her win she’d begun dating pig farmer Andrew, an old friend. But with 220 miles between them it was difficult to see one another regularly. She explained: 'Six months after my win - and wanting desperately to see Andrew - I suddenly thought what am I doing?

She and son Jake, now 22, moved to Andrew’s farm but she had no desire to become involved with the pigs. 'While it was wonderful to live on his father’s pig farm, I found the smell of the pigs overwhelming,' she says, 'and I couldn’t imagine being in muck all day.' However, one day she had an overwhelming urge to see how a female pig was getting on giving birth. 'At first I couldn’t bring myself to touch her but Andrew's dad Ken said if I didn’t help, both the mother and the piglets would die. I eventually pulled the piglet out alive. The sense of relief and joy was overwhelming and I’ve never looked back.' Sue, who has invested her winnings in property, added: 'I always imagined if I won the lottery I’d buy a new car and clothes.

"You may have thought all superyachts were created equal. But according to one designer, there is a gap in the market for vessels targeted at the fairer sex. In case the world's most powerful women don't want to splash out on the regular millionaires' toys on the market, luxury designer Lidia Bersani has created the first luxury mega yacht with a female in mind. The sleek white and gold yacht, measuring an impressive 262ft, is targeted at female buyers and is designed using crystal, gold, fur and flowers. It is even named La Belle, which translates as 'the beauty'. Luxury designer Lidia Bersani has created the first luxury mega yacht designed for a 'lady' and measuring 262ft in length . The master cabin is unsurprisingly lavish with a round king size double bed and baldachin and its own terrace with panoramic views . The 80-metre superyacht is not for the faint hearted, or Laura Ashley lovers. It's  a riot of opulent gold mosaics, mother of pearl, Swarovski crystal chandeliers, gemstones, onyx and bespoke wooden furniture. The boat's design revolves around  soft edges, smooth lines, floral patterns and a large amount of glass, crystal and bright white. Lidia Bersani's website says of La Belle: '[The] Yacht is in distinctive Bersani Style, romantic and warm. The colors in white, ivory and gold are predominant. Interior is full of opulent and comfortable elements.' The vessel could comfortably sleep 12 guests in six deluxe cabins. La Belle has gold mosaics, mother of pearl finishes, Swarovski crystal chandeliers, gemstones and onyx for the decadent sailor . If you get bored of sunning yourself on deck there are a few lounges, dining places and facilities for live music on board . The master cabin on the second deck is unsurprisingly decadent; with a round king size double bed and baldachin (a  canopy that traditionally sits over a throne or tomb of someone important), private terrace, thick curtains, gold touches and floral carpeting. There are five other guest suites spread around the boat. If you get bored of sunning yourself on deck the yacht has lounges, dining places and facilities for live music. In place of darts boards and computer games, you'll find a spa area with hyrdromassage pool, sauna, hamman, infrared sauna, snow room and ice fountains; small fitness club with outdoor Jacuzzi; library with fireplace; beauty centre, disco club, cinema – theatre, as well as a few bars. 'The idea is to equip this Super Yacht with ultra-modern stabilizing system and state of the art machinery and equipment,' says Lidia Bersani Luxury Design. Bars are spread about the vessel, as is a fitness sentre, spa, theatre, sauna, hamman, disco and even a snow room . There are five decks and a lift to get you from one to another, as well as a helicopter landing pad on the roof... although a gold helicopter is not included . Each of the five decks has an outside area for relaxing, sun bathing and looking our to sea. There's a lift as well as staircase to take you in between them. A helicopter landing pad sits on top of the vessel, naturally. And in the designs mocked up by Ms Bersani, a gold helicopter sits in board. Of the price, Ms Bersani told MailOnline, 'Unfortunately we do not have yet the final price. The idea is to build the most luxurious yacht on the world, and the golden decorations, Swarovski crystals, and some precious stones which we would like to use, it will be not cheap, I am sure.' 'The idea is to equip this Super Yacht with ultra-modern stabilizing system and state of the art machinery and equipment,' says Lidia Bersani .

"They are the much-coveted jetset jobs that see men and women fly around the world to exciting destinations. But working as cabin crew certainly comes with its trials - especially with the unusual requests often made by airlines. From a minimum arm reach to jungle training and even an enforced single relationship status, airlines often demand the most unlikely situations and skills of their employees. Scroll down for video . Qatar Airways air staff are required to have a minimum arm stretch of 84 inches while on tip-toes . To apply for a much-coveted job with luxury Gulf carrier Qatar Airways, flight attendants must have a minimum arm stretch of 84 inches while on tip-toes, presumably to reach the overhead lockers. The same airline was the subject of controversy just a year ago after it was reported that female cabin crew must remain unmarried for the first five years of their contract. The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) launched a campaign against the airline over its demands about marriage and pregnancy. The airline reportedly warns women who fall pregnant that they cannot be guaranteed ground staff jobs. Qatar came under fire for reportedly not allowing air stewardesses to marry in their first five years of the job . Akbar al Baker told Reuters: 'If you come to seek employment with Qatar Airways we give you a document that these are the rules and regulations, if you as a mature individual accept those conditions, then you shouldn’t complain.' He added: 'You know they have come there to do a job and we make sure that they are doing a job that they give us a good return on our investment.' MailOnline Travel has contacted Qatar Airways for further comment on the policy. That's not the only bizarre - and sometimes seemingly unnecessary - requirement made on future air stewards. Air stewards working for TAM airlines in Brazil are required to undergo a strict Amazon jungle training . For instance, Brazilian airline TAM require air staff to undergo intense Amazon jungle survival training. It makes sense. Over half of the country is covered in rugged rainforest and if an aircraft had to make an emergency landing among the trees, cabin crew need to be prepared. In fact, the country's government require any airline based in the country to offer this kind of training. According to Airline Reporter, TAM's course is undertaken by cabin crew in a section of rainforest behind their training centre, and includes instructions on using debris to build a makeshift lavatory. Meanwhile, Virgin Atlantic cabin crew - male and female -  must attend a 'groom school' at the airline's base in Crawley, near Gatwick Airport, to learn the company's staunch rules on appearance, which includes a minimum make up requirement. 'Stewardesses must wear mascara, blusher and red lipstick,' Grooming Manager Mim Allgood told the Daily Mail. EasyJet crew Emma Murry and Claudia Jackson sit in one of the engines of an Airbus A319 at Belfast airport . 'The boys are allowed to use clear mascara and wear make-up - like to cover up a spot - as long as you can't tell.' The airline has its own shade of lipstick - Upper Class Red by Bare Minerals, which exactly matches the uniform. 'The girls can pick any red from any brand and they needn't spend a fortune. Nails should be red too, or smartened with a French manicure or pale pink polish.' AirAsia also has its own unusual requests, asking for cabin crew applicants only aged between 20 and 28 with excellent eyesight. AirAsia advertises for staff aged between 20 and 28 years old who will not be allowed to wear glasses . However, applicants are assured they will be allowed to wear contact lenses if needed, but no glasses. EasyJet air stewards do not have such strict rules, but the safety requirements on their website stipulate that applicants must be able to tread water for at least a minute. Ryanair stops short of that but asks that all cabin crew are 'able to swim well'. They also request that stewards are between 5ft 2inches and 6 ft 2inches height 'with weight in proportion'. Like Qatar, Emirates requires that cabin crew have an arm reach of just less than 84 inches while standing on tiptoes. Virgin Atlantic cabin crew - male and female - are required to attend a 'Groom School' to hone their immaculate appearance . British Airways' Alice Kennedy who works as a member of the Gatwick cabin crew team . British Airways underline the importance for its cabin crew to look preened at all times.They request that tights are 10 or 15 denier in black, or nearly black, shirts  well ironed and crisp, and nail polish must be red or very pale natural shades. Amy James, Head of Worldwide Cabin Crew, told : 'We expect our crew to look the part and uphold high uniform standards, both in the air and on the ground. British Airways' uniform is one of the most distinctive and our customers immediately recognise our crew when they step on board.' According to one  poster, apparently recruiting  cabin crew in Thailand, AirAsia requires air stewards to be aged between 20 and 28, university educated and with a minimum height of 5 ft 3 inches. Those who fall short by an inch can reconcile themselves with the fact that they still make the Ryanair minimum height.","Qatar airlines request cabin crew have an arm stretch of 84 inches .

"It's the show which celebrates some of the most extreme body modification imaginable… and should you be uncomfortable with having your eyeball tattooed then look away now. These unsettling pictures show in excruciating close-up every detail of the process, carried out at this year's Venezuela Tattoo Expo in Caracas, which bills itself as being the biggest event of its kind in Latin America. Eyeball tattooing is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the bizarre procedures people have endured for the sake of (body) art. Implants, dental work, ear tunnels and even carving off bits of their own flesh have all been experimented with as enthusiasts compete for the most diabolical look. Ouch! Luis Alfonso has his eye tattooed black at Caracas's International Tattoo Festival . Hold him down: One twitch could be disastrous as Mr Alfonso's eye is injected with a dye . Extreme: It may seem a modern conceit, but eyeball tattooing was first described in 150AD by the Romans . Scary: A man with both eyes tattooed black, named only as Alex, poses for a photograph by revealing his tongue, which has been cut down the middle to give it a reptilian-style split . Lizard-like: Carlos Dehaquiz has also gone for the full eye tattoo, to complement his facial tatts and piercings . Moody: Body modification and tattoo artist Emilio Gonzalez, who has complemented his facial tattoos with horn-like piercings in his forehead and tunnels in his ears and lower lip . Boring: This heavily tattooed man, named as Luber, looks comparatively normal compared to others at the tattoo expo who have experimented with the more extreme body modifications . Hidden talent: Luciel could pass for a normal person, and perhaps does when she dons a trouser suit for work or weddings.

"They moved to the city with dreams of making it big. But for countryside-bred migrants, life in Beijing is not cheap. The answer? Go underground. Welcome to the so-called Rat Tribe: the one million people that have made a home out of bunkers below the surface of China's second-biggest city. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The Rat Tribe: Niu Song, 33, and his wife Zhao Ansheng, 32, are both chefs who live under Beijing to save money - like hundreds of others . The history: The structures were erected in 1969 under Chairman Mao's rule during the Cold War who feared an imminent Soviet attack . With some as low as 300 yuan a month ($48), they are a fraction of the price of rentals above ground. The structures were erected in 1969 under Chairman Mao's rule during the Cold War. Fearing an imminent Soviet attack, cities were ordered to prepare safety measures. Around 20,000 bomb shelters were dug. When Mao died and Deng Xiaoping came to the fore, such defensive tactics were sidelined - leaving the city with a pointless network of caves. Unsurprisingly, hundreds of entrepreneurial landlords descended on the bunkers, letting out rooms as hostels. By the mid-90s, the government latched on to the scheme and many of the rooms are now part of a for-profit housing system. An alternative: Twenty-five-year-old Ji Lanlan and her three-year-old daughter, Yu Qi, enjoy a game on their computer in one of the largest rooms in this basement in west Beijing, China. The units were built in 1969 under Chairman Mao who feared a Soviet Attack . Bar waitress Jiang Ying, 24, and 23-year-old office worker Li Ying have lived here for one and a half years to avoid sky-high rental prices . When Mao died and Deng Xiaoping came to the fore, such defensive tactics were sidelined - leaving the city with a pointless network of caves . Located near the deserts of the north east, the network is also a welcome environment for all seasons: cool in summer, warm in winter . It means people like Zhang Xi, an aspiring actor from Mongolia, can support themselves and pursue their dreams. His parents implored him to take a job as a policeman back at home where he could be comfortable. But he is determined. In a short film by artist Sim Chi Yin that explores the subterranean network, he explained: 'When my father came to visit me he cried when he saw where I lived. He said, ""Son, this won’t do.""' 'But I told him: ""When I go out and meet people I always look very presentable. Who's going to be able to tell that I live in a basement?""' Other dwellers include Chen Laxiu, a 50-year-old woman from the coal-mining town of Liupanshui, who moved to Beijing to be near her sons after farming proved unprofitable. Making ends meet: He Bing, 23, tries on a borrowed suit and tie for size the night before an examination to become an insurance salesman . Melon seeds and instant noodles are splattered all over the floor in his room, but Liu Fei, 24 in purple, originally from Anhui Province, is just having a smoke and playing a computer game. For him, all the matters is making ends meet in Beijing, China's second-biggest city . Uncertain future? A question mark hangs over their future as officials in 2010 announced a crackdown on health and safety in the city . Zhang Xinwen moved to the bunkers after graduating from high school in Hubei province to pursue a career as an artist. Li Yang, from Beijing suburb Tongzhou, wants to be a fly fishing official, but currently works as a car mechanic, and lives in the bunkers to save money. And an entire family - Xu Junping, her 17-year-old son Zhou Zhengdi, and her husband Zhou Hailin - have opted for a simpler life. Located near the deserts of the north east, the underground network is also a welcome environment for all seasons: cool in summer, warm in winter. Though most of the inhabitants foresee a move on to bigger and better things - above ground - the vast majority are content and grateful. Xie Jinghui, originally from Jiangxi,  used to live in a more central location within Beijing's 3rd Ring Road, but one year ago the house was torn down. He says: 'Everybody thinks that living in the basement is only a temporary thing but then people end up staying much longer' Something of a family home for this couple: Shang Lanlan, 27, and her husband have moved underground for lack of funds. They have left their 5-year-old son with her parents back in their native Shandong Province in eastern China . However, a question mark hangs over their future as officials in 2010 announced a crackdown on health and safety in the city. And the native citizens see the Rat Tribe as unwelcome intruders. But despite city plans to wipe out the system by 2012, it provides a convenient answer to the question of affordable housing. For now, the future is uncertain.","Chairman Mao built network of 20,000 bunkers under Beijing fearing Soviet Union attack in 1969 .

"The new sheriff of a Wyoming county has banned his deputies from wearing cowboy hats and boots, a change that led one longtime deputy to retire rather than give up his Western attire. Sublette County Sheriff Stephen Haskell imposed the new dress code across his patch that includes Pinedale, which True West magazine recently named one of its 'top ten' true Western towns. Haskell is requiring deputies to wear black trousers, a tan shirt, black boots and a black ball cap, saying the change is for safety and uniformity. Fond farewell: Cowboy boots and hats have been banned at one police office in Wyoming - the uniform change led Gene Bryson to retire last Friday after 28 years with the department . 'I'm very much for the Western way of life and the look. And that's the way I dress,' Haskell told the Casper Star-Tribune. 'However, for a professional outfit . . . I like everybody to look the same. We are one team unified in one purpose. That is to do our job.' Haskell, 53, who has worked in law enforcement for three years, also argues that cowboy boots are slippery on ice and cowboy hats can blow away in Wyoming's blustery wind. The change led Deputy Gene Bryson to retire last Friday after 28 years with the department and about 40 years total in law enforcement. His uniform included a brown cowboy hat, brown cowboy boots and a leather vest in the summer or a wool vest in the winter. The uniform change is 'kind of the reason why I retired,' Bryson, 70, told the newspaper. Old school style: Bryson’s Old West look was so popular in town that tourists would often ask for pictures . All change: Bryson stands with members of the department, who appear wearing the new uniform consisting of black shirts and baseball caps . 'I am not going to change. I've been here for 40-odd years in the sheriff's office, and I'm not going to go out and buy combat boots and throw my vest and hat away and say, 'This is the new me.'"" Bryson was born and raised on a ranch in Montana and has worked on ranches in Colorado and Wyoming. He went into law enforcement in 1974. 'And I've had a cowboy hat on since 19,' Bryson said. 'That's what looks good to me in the sheriff's department. It's Western. It's Wyoming.' Bryson’s Old West look was so popular in town that tourists would often ask for pictures. The retiree now plans to spend more time with his wife and grandchildren. He will also commit fully to his gun shop business in Marbleton, which he has run on a part-time basis for many years. He fondly described his time in the forces as 'one hell of a ride.'","New Sublette County Sheriff Stephen Haskell imposed the change in dress code last month .

"An abandoned public toilet is set to be transformed into a three-bedroom house after a developer snapped it up for £80,000. The toilet block in Ventnor on the Isle of Wight has stood empty since March 2011 when it was closed to the public. But now the building looks set for a new lease of life after council planners on the island agreed that a new floor could be added to turn the block into a family home. This abandoned public toilet on the Isle of Wight is set to be transformed into a three-bedroom house after a developer snapped it up for £80,000 .

And the new first floor of the town centre property will have room for two bedrooms, an open plan kitchen and a sitting room. Permission to add a first floor extension to the property in the seaside resort and change its usage was granted last week. The closure of the toilets, which were deemed surplus to requirements in March 2011, sparked an angry reaction with a 333-signature petition being presented to Isle of Wight Council council. Planning permission had previously been granted to demolish the existing buildings and to replace it with a two storey block of four flats. The toilet block, seen on a floor plan in its current state, was bought by a developer last year . The men's and women's blocks, plus mobility toilets and cleaners room will be torn out and replaced with a bedroom, store room, shower room and utility room . Council planners had recommended that consent be given for the changes to the 1990s-built block, and said the proposed house would not look out of keeping with other buildings in the area. The council had agreed to sell the freehold interest in the site for £80,000 in September last year. The block will not be the first to be converted into a home.

"Three people have been tested for bird flu as the slaughter of 10,000 chickens begins on a farm struck by Britain's first outbreak of the H7N7 strain in seven years. Officers ordered that the entire flock at the farm in Upham, Hampshire, be culled, and they imposed a 1km (0.6 miles) exclusion zone around the site after the chickens tested positive for the strain of avian influenza. It is understood that three people, including an official from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), were tested for the disease after showing symptoms but were proved to be negative. Scroll down for video . A police officer puts a barrier in place in the village of Upham, Hampshire, after an outbreak of bird flu was confirmed at a farm nearby, and three people were tested for the disease . Officers have imposed a 1km (0.6 miles) exclusion zone around the site after the chickens tested positive for the strain of avian influenza . All of the birds at the commercial chicken breeding farm, which has not been named, are to be slaughtered as part of action to prevent any spread of the disease. The outbreak was confirmed last Friday following several deaths amongst the chickens, according to a source. It is the second outbreak of bird flu in in just four months, but this time it has been identified as the H7 strain, which officials insisted was 'much less severe' than the H5N8 strain found at a Yorkshire duck farm in November. Defra said there are no links between the two cases and Public Health England said the risk to public health is very low, but scientists have shown that the virus can infect humans. H7N7 was detected in the UK in June 2008, when egg-laying hens at a farm in Banbury, Oxfordshire had to be culled. A spokesman from Defra told MailOnline that the previous case had been more serious than the current outbreak. All of the birds at the commercial chicken breeding farm, which has not been named, are to be slaughtered as part of action to prevent any spread of the disease . A police car drives down a road closed because of a bird flu outbreak in Upham, as experts work to establish the source of the outbreak . It is understood that three people, including an official from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), were tested for the disease after showing symptoms but were proved to be negative . There have been several outbreaks of the H7N7 flu in China and 18 months ago it was found in Italy. During the Italian outbreak in August 2013, three poultry workers became infected with the virus, developing conjunctivitis. More than 1 million chickens and other poultry were culled during the Italian crisis. Tests carried out by scientists in Hong Kong in 2013 revealed there was a potential risk for humans after revealing that the strain can cause severe pneumonia in ferrets. The exclusion zone around the farm will remain in place for at least three weeks while Defra officials work to establish exactly where the outbreak had stemmed from, and if it has spread. Chief Vet Nigel Gibbens said last night: 'We have taken immediate action to contain this outbreak as part of our robust procedures for dealing swiftly with avian flu. 'This is a low severity form of the virus and we are taking action to ensure that the disease does not spread or develop into a more severe form. 'We are investigating the possible sources of the outbreak. 'I would urge poultry keepers in the surrounding area to be vigilant for any signs of disease and to ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises.' Officers have ordered that the entire flock at the farm in Upham, Hampshire, be culled after the chickens tested positive for the H7N7 strain of avian influenza. Pictured: An outbreak at a Yorkshire farm in November . The outbreak is the second of the disease to hit the UK in four months, following the outbreak at a Yorkshire duck farm last November (pictured). Officials have insisted that the most recent case is 'much less severe' Nick Phin, director for the Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control said: 'Based on what we know about this strain of avian influenza and the actions that have been taken, the risk to human health in this case is considered very low. 'Public Health England continues to work closely with Defra throughout this investigation.' The Food Standards Agency said there was no risk to food supplies. 'On the basis of current scientific evidence, Food Standards Agency advice is that avian (bird) flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers,' a spokesman said. 'Laboratory investigations on the outbreak indicate that it is the N7 sub-type of H7 but this will need to be confirmed in further testing.' MP for Meon Valley George Hollingbery said the outbreak was 'very concerning'. Officials said the chickens at the Hampshire farm had tested positive for the H7N7 strain of avian influenza . He said yesterday: 'I’ve been liaising closely with Public Health England, based in Fareham, Hampshire County Council and Defra throughout today to ensure I’m kept up to date with developments. 'It appears that all precautions have taken place to ensure this problem is dealt with effectively and the experts are doing all they can to identify exactly what type of H7 strain it could be. 'Most importantly, I have been told that presently any danger to the public is very low and this is very welcome news. The strain is a mild one and is not similar to the recent outbreak at a duck farm in East Yorkshire. 'However, there is no doubt the authorities are taking it very seriously and regular updates will be issued in due course.' Dr Nicola Lewis, research associate in the Department of Zoology at University of Cambridge, said: 'If the virus is confirmed as a low pathogenic – or low severity – H7N7 avian influenza virus then the investigating authorities will try to work out where it might have come from and how it might have infected the chickens on the farm. It is a different subtype and severity of influenza virus from the H5N8 case last November in Yorkshire so these two outbreaks are not directly linked. Public Health England said the risk to public health is very low. Pictured: Medication to treat bird flu strains . 'Low pathogenic avian flu viruses naturally infect wild birds. These wild birds get several influenza infections a year, often with different subtypes of influenza, and usually these wild birds don't appear sick. 'These wild birds also migrate and can carry their influenza viruses among geographic regions. 'The investigating scientists will be able to compare the virus genetic material from this outbreak to influenza viruses in both wild and domestic birds, from both within and outside the UK to try to work out where it might have come from. In the meantime, the control measures taken on the farm by the UK authorities will ensure that the virus doesn't mutate into something more severe and so safeguard human health.' The last outbreak of bird flu, which is unrelated to the current case, saw 6,000 ducks culled at a farm in Nafferton, East Yorkshire, involving the H5N8 strain. That farm was owned by Cherry Valley Farms, Britain's biggest duck producer, which supplies ready meals to M&S, Tesco, Lidl and Aldi. There have been no cases of human infection with bird flu in the UK. Dr Derek Gatherer, Lecturer in Bioinformatics, Lancaster University, said: 'H7N7 is a completely different sub-type of avian influenza A to H5N8. 'H5N8 is relatively new, and is a hybrid (“re-assortant” is the technical term) between the old H5N1 highly pathogenic strain and an unknown other strain. 'H7N7 on the other hand is much more familiar, and exists in two continental varieties – North American and Eurasian. 'I would guess that the Hampshire strain will turn out to be a Eurasian one. There have been occasional infections of humans with H7N7, most recently in Italy in late August 2013, and prior to that in the Netherlands in February 2003. 'None of these cases were severe, and all patients fully recovered. The virus is only transmitted from birds to humans and not from person-to-person. There is no danger to the general public.' Ducks were culled at the farm in Nafferton, East Yorkshire, after strains of bird flu were detected . Britain's largest duck farmer – which supplies ready meals to M&S, Tesco, Lidl and Aldi – was at the centre of the first outbreak of bird flu in six years. Cherry Valley Farms – which rears nearly half of the 15million ducks a year bred in the UK – was forced to cull all 6,000 birds at one of its sites in East Yorkshire last November. Officials imposed an ‘exclusion zone’, restricting movement of poultry within six miles of the breeding farm which houses Pekin ducks that produce eggs to be hatched for their meat. It came after the animals tested positive for bird flu, also known as avian flu. At the time, officials said the outbreak may have been be linked to a strain of avian influenza, which originated in the Far East and  infected birds in Germany and the Netherlands. It was the first serious case of bird flu in Britain since 2008, when the H7N7 strain was found in free-range laying hens near Banbury, Oxfordshire.","Officers order cull after bird flu case reported at chicken farm in Hampshire .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott was today forced to urge his colleagues not to topple him in a 'make-or-break' speech. 'We were elected because the Australian people rejected chaos. That's why we were elected,' Mr Abbott told the National Press Club after a nightmare couple of weeks. In a message clearly aimed at his own party members, some who are scheming over his future, Mr Abbott said: 'It's the people that hire, and frankly it's the people that should fire'. The address - in which Mr Abbott sounded somewhat hoarse - was marked by a series of major backdowns. Scroll down for video . Fighting chance? Prime Minister Tony Abbott's landmark speech today was marked by a series of major backdowns, including his paid parental leave scheme and his much-pilloried knighthoods plan . Mr Abbott today announced he will no longer be responsible for doling out knighthoods. He was ridiculed after selecting Prince Philip for the role . Mr Abbott's speech today was widely touted as a 'make or break' moment following a torrid couple of weeks, all topped off by a backbench revolt . He announced he was effectively banning himself from doling out knighthoods, handing over the responsibility 'wholely and solely' to the Order of Australia Council. He admitted he may have gotten 'carried away' with the awards system of knights and dames, which he himself brought back after decades. And his proposed paid parental leave scheme - which would have paid new mothers 26 weeks full wage capped at $100,000 - was scrapped after a lengthy period of backbencher moaning. Mr Abbott instead announced the government will begin formulating a new childcare and families package. And he assured voters the GST would not be increased without a 'political consensus' - name-checking all of the states and even Opposition Leader Bill Shorten. Mr Shorten's team have been gleefully capitalising on the Prime Minister's torrid few weeks, even distributing a game of bingo to reporters prior to Mr Abbott's speech which included known Abbott catchphrases. The prime minister has been shaken by a coming together of various blows in recent weeks. At the weekend, the Liberal National Party government lost dozens of seats at the Queensland state election and has likely lost its grip on power there. Mr Abbott was widely pilloried for knighting Prince Philip on Australia Day. And already this year he lost out to doctors when they launched a successful campaign against his plans to cut the Medicare rebate. Leadership speculation has raged in recent days but Mr Abbott today warned that his government must not repeat the mistakes of the past. 'The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years cannot become the new normal lest Australia join the weak government club and become a second rate country living off its luck,' he said. 'He's got a tin ear. The captain's pick of Prince Philip was basically a fatal blow to his prime ministership. I think he's got until the end of this week.' - South Australian independent senator Nick Xenophon. 'If they think it's the salesman, not what they're selling, they will have learned nothing. It's the arrogance which really frustrates people.' - Opposition leader Bill Shorten . 'It's not just Tony Abbott, it's the Abbott government policies that are the problem. They have to reject the cruel and arrogant way they have been leaning on the poor.' - Greens leader Christine Milne. 'We would be crazy to repeat the experience of the last Labor government.' - George Brandis. 'We can't continue as we are. We are getting bad feedback.' - Liberal back bencher Jane Prentice looking at the federal impact of the Queensland election wipeout on Saturday night. 'The prime minister has the support of all members of his government, including me.' - Communications Minister and purported leadership contender Malcolm Turnbull. The results come as speculation grows that a leadership adjustment is on the cards, possibly reinstating Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to the top role . There have been suggestions that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull may be in line for the top job. Backbenchers began talking openly about dumping Mr Abbott as leader after the 'catastrophic' election result in Queensland. Mr Abbott called an emergency Cabinet meeting on the weekend to restore backbenchers' confidence following the humiliating start to 2015. Some of Mr Abbott's closest allies on Sunday conceded party members were unsettled but insisted his leadership was not under imminent threat . 'A few anonymous voices and a couple of people who have been prepared to put their head up do not constitute a basis to unsettle a prime ministership,' Attorney-General George Brandis said. However, opposition members have called for an end to Mr Abbot's time as Prime Minister, claiming his days are numbered. 'If they think it's the salesman, not what they're selling, they will have learned nothing. It's the arrogance which really frustrates people,' Opposition leader Bill Shorten said on Sunday. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, the deputy Liberal leader, has also been rumoured to be lined up for the job . 'All we are talking about now is the timing and method of execution,' one Queensland MP told ABC News. 'This is catastrophic, unimaginable,' said another. And its not just Mr Abbott that some people have in their sights. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch was back on Twitter again berating the government for its poor showing in the Queensland elections. 'Shock turnover in Q'land outing okay government.. Blank check to nobodies. Can't ignore this a huge message for Feds. People have spoken!' Earlier in the week the media tycoon tweeted that Mr Abbott should sack his chief-of-staff Peta Credlin after his widely scorned decision to award British royal Prince Philip a knighthood on Australia Day. The Sunday Telegraph reported that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has confirmed to the prime minister privately she would not challenge him for the leadership at this point, but refused to deny it may happen in the future. Following leadership troubles for Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister steered clear of the Queensland campaign amid fears his presence would be a detriment to the campaign.","Prime Minister Abbott has urged his colleagues not to topple him .

"New England Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler who made the game-winning play in the Superbowl says he had a vision that he could bring his team to victory. The 24-year-old rookie, nicknamed 'Scrap', who was only signed as an undrafted free agent in May, said he really started to believe in his ability after a conversation with an Uber driver. 'When I really believed it is, when I called an Uber driver for my mom, my mom called me and told me, 'The guy spoke nice of you and he said he felt like you're going to do something fantastic tomorrow.'  Butler told ABC News. 'I just prayed on it and I just went out and played as hard as I could, and it turned out great.' New England Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler who made the game-winning play in the Superbowl says had a vision that he could help bring his team to victory. The 24-year-old rookie, nicknamed 'Scrap', said he really started to believe in his ability after a conversation with an Uber driver . New England Patriots strong safety Malcolm Butler  intercepts a pass intended for Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette in the fourth quarter in Super Bowl at University of Phoenix Stadium . Butler wasn't even part of the rotation to start Super Bowl XLIX, but proved his worth on Sunday - with Seattle at the one-yard line inside the final minute, he took a chance and threw himself in front of Ricardo Lockette, intercepting Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson and ensuring a 28-24 win. Butler, who used to working part-time at a Popeyes chicken joint, said after the game: 'I just had a vision that I was going to make a big play.' He told ABC News that the first person he wanted to hug and kiss after the game with his mother. He said he wanted to make her proud after she spent his childhood in Vicksburg, Miss., working two jobs to support him and his four siblings. 'You see some tough things growing up, and I just always said, 'I didn't want to have that life,'' he said. 'I wanted to be someone.

'And I just wanted to make my family a better family and inspire young kids that anyone, that you can do whatever you wanted to do if you put your mind to it and you just believe and have faith.' Butler went to school in West Alabama, after he started his college career at Hinds Community College in Raymond, Miss. In 2010 he took a part-time job at the fast food chain after he was dismissed five games into his freshman season  – the reason has not been disclosed, but he has a charge for possession of drug paraphernalia on his record. After working and taking classes at Alcorn State, Butler worked his way back on the team and eventually made it to West Alabama. New England Patriots strong safety Malcolm Butler celebrates the interception . According to Twitter, the most tweeted moment of the night was when Butler intercepted the pass . He said he had been warned during the week by coach Bill Belichick to be prepared for such a play. 'I got beat on the route on Tuesday or Wednesday in practice and Bill told me they are going to do that and they did,' Butler told reporters. Butler, who played for the University of West Alabama after transferring from Hinds Community College in Mississippi, said he was alerted to the play by the way Seattle stacked their receivers. 'I just drove on the ball,' he said. 'I've seen some crazy plays (in Super Bowls) and I guess I am down in history for one of them.' Two plays earlier Butler had been unable to stop the Seahawks when Wilson went deep to Jermaine Kearse, who somehow grabbed the ball after losing it. 'I did my job but at the same time, he caught the ball. I felt like the game was on me and so when I got back in the game that is why I didn't hesitate to jump a route and pick the ball off,' Butler said. 'Everybody earned this ring but I am just so glad that I could come through with a clutch play that really got the ring.' Butler earned his nickname because of his habit of always being involved in the action in practice. 'We call him 'Scrap' because the first time we saw him he was so scrappy and he found himself around the ball all the time,' said defensive tackle Vince Wilfork. 'I think that was one of the main reasons he was in the game. He makes plays. 'That moment with him making that play is just a fairytale ending to a book because of what he has done all year for us. 'It is an amazing feeling to be a rookie and come in and basically win the ball game for us. Amazing'. Tom Brady said:'For a rookie to make a play like that in the Super Bowl, it's unbelievable.' According to Twitter, the most tweeted moment of the night was when Butler intercepted the pass.

"TV news helicopter pilot Zoey Tur has completed her sex change to join Inside Edition as America's first transgender reporter. Tur, formerly known as Chopper Bob, became famous for filming a mob beating driver Reginald Denny during the LA Riots, and the O.J. Simpson car chase. Following 14 months of hormone treatment Tur  underwent successful sexual reassignment surgery in June 2014, transitioning from male to female. Scroll down for video . Legendary news helicopter pilot Zoey Tur has joined Inside Edition as America's first transgender TV reporter . Tur, formerly known as Chopper Bob, filmed a mob beating driver Reginald Denny during the LA Riots, and the O.J. Simpson car chase . Tur is now ready to go back on screen and will be the programme's Special Correspondent for the month of February. 'There's diversity in nature, so why not the media? I want to thank INSIDE EDITION for their support in what's shaping up to be America's last civil rights fight,' says Tur. The 54-year-old from Santa Monica, who has two children, decided to begin the change in 2013 and said that once the process was complete 'Bob must die' to make way for Zoey. After 14 months of hormone treatment in June last year Tur underwent successful sexual reassignment surgery transitioning from male to female . She said she was 'done hiding', after starting to push family and friends away and had suffered from body dysmorphic disorder. Family and friends were supportive of the Tur's decision, although she said that for some it felt like grieving as they prepared to say goodbye to Bob. Tur's daughter Katy is Foreign Correspondent for NBC News, based in London . 'For the most part, people didn't know. They were in a state of shock initially,' she told CBS Los Angeles. 'My kids were in a state of shock. And they have been going through this mourning process. Bob Tur has got to die. And that's going to happen within the next three or four months.' Going through the transitional period 'has not been easy' Tur said, adding she had been worried how it would affect her children including daughter, Katy, who is a reporter on NBC Nightly News. Tur, who married fellow reporter Marika Gerrard at age 23 and has dated Carrie Fisher, has more than 10,000 flying hours over war zones and riots. She said in 2013 the hormone therapy had already affected the way she flew, adding that her thought pattern had become more analytical than instinctive. She said that she planned to have surgery to make her face more feminine and to have sexual reassignment surgery. In an interview with TMZ she said: 'Transgender people really are misunderstood. It's not what you think'. The pilot says she has had a female brain since birth, but struggled to come to terms with who she is. 'It's a genetic disorder that happens in utero. Nobody knows exactly why, but you're born with a female or feminized brain,' she said. 'If you don't really know who you are. You think you're a woman, but you're a man.' Tur helped capture images of truck driver Reginald Denny being beaten during the LA riots . The pilot was also there to get footage of OJ Simpson's car chase in June 1994 .","Tur, formerly known as Chopper Bob, became famous for filming mob beating during the LA Riots and O.J.

"Rating: . There is a knock on the door at 7.15am. What could the matter be? I abandon my ablutions and open the door. A man is standing with two newspapers I had ordered. Presumably, the knock at weekends is even earlier. It is not a great start to the day. But then, just about everything about the newly opened Dorsett has jarred from the moment we set foot inside the huge, soulless lobby that has all the charm of an airport hotel in Nowheresville. Impressive on the outside: The Dorsett Shepherd's Bush has been slotted into the former Pavilion Cinema . This is doubly disappointing because it is terrific from the outside. The listed building started out as the Pavilion Cinema in 1923 and looks across Shepherd’s Bush Green in West London. It is Chinese-owned - which might explain the clashing, shiny interiors. Signs are written in English and Mandarin. Apparently, lots of Chinese stay here to be near the Westfield Shopping Centre. Check-in takes an age. The printer is not working and the receptionist keeps going behind the scenes to sort it out. I’m paying £150, room only. She tells me that if I want a bath I can upgrade to an ‘executive room’ for an extra £20. I ask if she can upgrade me for nothing given that there are 317 rooms and dozens of those are empty. She won’t budge. I push it some more and she relents. The corridors have empty cheap picture frames on the walls. They look absurd. It’s a relief to get to the room, which is fine in a gauche sort of way. We like the bed, with its white leather headboard and the Chinese wallpaper behind it. The rest of it is tinny. We pop our noses into the restaurant off the lobby, but the smell of stale food and the bright lights repel us. The receptionist had said the hotel has ‘an arrangement’ with the Chinese restaurant next door, so we go there instead. Turns out there is no arrangement at all, save for their being an entrance to it from the lobby. A spacious sort of welcome: The lobby is certainly large, but our Inspector considered it 'soulless' The heating isn’t working properly in our room, you can’t open the windows and the bathroom is cramped. Breakfast is complicated. For £12 you get tea or coffee and access to the continental buffet. I ask for a double espresso but am told it will cost extra. ‘I only intend to have two scoops of yogurt,’ I tell the restaurant manager. ‘Are you really going to charge me £12 and then insist that I pay extra for the coffee.’ ‘I’m sorry, but that is what it costs,’ he says, politely. But when he asks me to sign the chit, he can’t bring himself to charge for the coffee. Lo and behold, the printer is still not working when I check out, and the whole process takes ten minutes. They email my receipt later. Best that can be said is that Dorsett is a work in progress. Dorsett Shepherd’s Bush . 58 Shepherd’s Bush Green . London .

"Waking up and travelling to work in the dark can make the day ahead seem unbearable. To solve this,  one train company has come up with the world's first 'therapy carriage' - which is designed to make people less depressed about the weather. The unique carriage was decked out with bright lights which are used to help treat people who suffer from a winter depression known as 'Seasonal Affective Disorder' (SAD). Scroll down for video . First Great Western has developed the first 'therapy carriage', in which bright lights are installed to make passengers feel less depressed on dark and cold winter days . The Lumie lights installed in the train carriage mimic sunlight, which can help people suffering Seasonal Affective Disorder, a type of seasonal depression . SAD affects 500,000 people every winter between September and April, and in particular, during January and February. And this morning's 7.06am First Great Western train from London Paddington Station to Penzance, Cornwall, was full of special SAD Lumie lights - which are designed to help treat SAD. First Great Western collaborated with charity the Seasonal Affective Disorder Association (SADA), to see how they could brighten passenger's journeys as the winter blues take their toll. SAD is caused by a chemical imbalance due to the shortening of daylight hours, and the lack of sunlight in winter. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that has a seasonal pattern. The episodes of depression tend to occur at the same time each year, usually during the winter. As with other types of depression, the two main symptoms of SAD are a low mood and a lack of interest in life. Sufferers may also be less active than normal and sleep more. Being animals, humans are all affected to some extent by changes in light and the seasons. Most people like comfort food and tend to feel more lethargic in winter. For about 20 per cent of the UK population, mildly debilitating symptoms of SAD cause discomfort but not serious suffering. This is called 'Sub-syndromal SAD' or 'Winter Blues'. For about 2 per cent, SAD is a seriously disabling illness which prevents them from functioning normally without the appropriate treatment. Source: Seasonal Affective Disorder Association (SADA) The SAD  lights, which were installed in the carriages, help alleviate symptoms of depression during the dark winter days. This is because they reproduce daylight and provide bright light which it's claimed increases levels of alertness, boosts mood and improves overall day-to-day performance. The lights offer high levels of light intensity as they each deliver 10,000 Lux - the method in which the intensity of visible light is measured - which is said to be enough bright light to get the body clock back on track. During a bright day, the level of brightness ranges from 10,000 to 25,000 Lux. Jamie Anderson from First Great Western said: 'With the dark winter mornings and evenings, and post-Christmas blues, the first few months of the year are traditionally a time when people look to book a summer holiday, or a long weekend away, often taking advantage of the longer daylight hours on the south coast. 'Until then, we are trying to shine a ray of light on people's journeys, and help them arrive at work and travel home again without the ""winter blues"".' Jenny Scott-Thompson, from SADA, added: 'With the continual lack of light and a long, cold January after the Christmas celebrations, this time of year is the peak time people suffer symptoms of SAD. 'We are pleased First Great Western is taking this step to help alleviate passengers suffering with SAD Lumie lights on board.' The 7.06am service runs daily to Cornwall, a region which averages over ten more hours of sunshine a month in January than the rest of the UK, according to the Met Office. Cornwall averages 58 hours of sunshine in January, compared with an average of just 47 hours across the UK as a whole. January and February is the peak time for SAD, which is caused by a chemical imbalance due to the shortening of daylight hours, and the lack of sunlight in winter .","Train company has made a 'therapy carriage' containing 'happy lamps'

"A Black Hawk helicopter crash that killed four U.S. servicemen on a British nature reserve occurred after a bird-strike knocked the pilots unconscious. Christopher S Stover, Sean M Ruane, Dale E Mathews and Afton M Ponce all died when a US Air Force helicopter came down in Cley-next-the-Sea, Norfolk during a training exercise on January 7. An Accident Investigation Board report into the accident today found that a flock of geese, startled by the noise, had struck the helicopter, breaking through its windscreen and colliding with the pilots. Crash: An a report into the Black Hawk found that a flock of geese, startled by the noise, struck the helicopter, breaking through its windscreen and colliding with the pilots . Technician Sgt Dale Mathews (pictured left and right) was named as one of the victims by RAF Lakenheath. He died alongside Captain Christopher S. Stover, Captain Sean M. Ruane and Staff Sergeant Afton M. Ponce . Tragic: Captain Sean Ruane, pictured with his wife Rachel and son Liam. The family is understood to have fallen in love with life in Britain before Mr Ruane's death . The helicopter's stabilisation systems were disabled by the bird strike, leaving the aircraft moving randomly through the air and causing it to crash three seconds later. The crew were serving with 56th Rescue Squadron, 48th Fighter Wing, based at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, which carries out search and rescue operations. At the time they were on a training mission to recreate a night-time rescue scenario involving a downed F-16 pilot. As they flew over Cley Marshes the helicopter was engulfed by a flock of geese, which weighed up to 12lbs each, after the birds were 'likely startled by the noise of the approaching helicopters'. Brigadier . General Jon Norman, president of the inquiry’s board, said his . investigation had 'found clear and convincing evidence' that 'multiple . bird strikes caused the mishap'. Nature reserve: The helicopter came down in one of Britain's finest areas for bird watching. Today's report concluded that the aircraft crashed due to a bird strike . Standing guard: British police officers were seen standing by a second helicopter which landed just yards from the downed aircraft, seen in the foreground . Hovering above: A police helicopter was seen surveying the crash scene as military personnel and emergency services combed the area for clues . As well as the tragic loss of life, the crash cost the US government an estimated £23.5 million, the report said. 'At least three geese penetrated the windscreen, rendering the mishap pilot and mishap co-pilot unconscious, and at least one goose struck the mishap aerial gunner in the performance of special mission aviator duties, rendering the mishap aerial gunner unconscious,' it adds. With the pilot and co-pilot unconscious and stabilisation systems disabled, the helicopter’s control stick would have moved randomly, the report adds. The helicopter banked to the left and, unable to lift vertically, hit the ground within seconds. The report states that the crew 'followed the available guidance on bird hazards in the UK' and complied with the UK Military Low Flying Handbook to the 'maximum extent'. First light: Police guard the north Norfolk coast where the U.S. helicopter came down on the marshes in the background, close to the village of Salthouse . Ring of steel: Police shut off an area around the crash zone over fears the public could be injured because of ammunition scattered around the marsh . Picturesque: A view of the salt marshes from the coastal footpath near Cley-next-the-Sea, Norfolk . Recent bird activity maps had suggested low activity in the area but a storm surge the previous month had forced several flocks of birds to relocate from the nearby Blakeney Nature Reserve. This relocation is likely to have resulted in a larger-than-normal presence of geese. The MoD said it had received 11 complaints about low flying in 2013, none of which were made by people living in the Cley area. These related to the noise created by aircraft and not safety risks. A 'seasonal avoidance' had been in place between April and September each year since 2012 following an application from the wildlife trust but this accident happened outside that period. Specialists: A lorry carrying a digger sweeps along the Norfolk coastline as the armed forces prepared to remove wreckage from the crash zone . Shut off: A cordon was set up around the Norfolk crash site because the helicopter contained live ammunition . Air accident: The armed aircraft, a Pave Hawk from the American airforce base at RAF Lakenheath, Suffolk, was out on a routine low-level flying exercise (file picture) An MoD spokesman said it had no new comment in light of the report, but previously said: 'We understand that military low flying can be noisy and unpopular but it is an essential part of operational training.' 'The 20th century legacy of military airfields close to this location does make this a particularly busy area for aircraft and the MoD is constantly striving to ensure that such disturbance is kept to an absolute minimum and that the burden of noise pollution is as evenly distributed as possible throughout the UK Low Flying System as a whole.' 'In addition the MoD takes the protection of wildlife and habitats very seriously and liaises constantly with the joint nature conservation committee.'","Flock of geese startled by noise of U.S. air force helicopter struck aircraft .

"The leader of a Kansas commune that prosecutors say lived off of insurance payouts following the deaths of group members is set to stand trial for murder in the 2003 drowning of one of them — a young mother whose death he allegedly foretold weeks before it happened. Daniel U. Perez, a 55-year-old self-proclaimed seer, is charged with first-degree premeditated murder in the death of 26-year-old Patricia Hughes at the group's compound in the Wichita suburb of Valley Center. Jury selection begins Monday in Sedgwick County District Court. Authorities have investigated several deaths linked to the group, but the Wichita trial will deal only with Hughes's death and other crimes that allegedly occurred while its fewer than a dozen members lived communally in Sedgwick County. Jury selection begins Monday, Feb. 2, 2015,  in the trial of Perez, 55, for first-degree premeditated murder of Patricia Hughes at the Valley Center compound where the group lived . The bizarre case led investigators through a web of false identities and money that stretched through Texas, South Dakota, Missouri, Kansas and Tennessee. Its members lived together in one large home or in houses in close proximity, and moved from state to state. They have apparently dispersed since Perez, who had assumed the false identity of Lou Castro, was first arrested in 2010 on identity theft charges and sent to federal prison for two years. Kansas authorities unsealed the state charges in 2012 as soon as he finished that sentence and he has been jailed awaiting trial ever since. Investigators initially believed Hughes drowned while trying to rescue her 2-year-old daughter from a swimming pool. But they reclassified it a homicide after a woman came forward and said it had been staged to look like an accident. The woman, who was 12 years old at the time, testified during a pretrial hearing that right before she died, Hughes kissed her 2-year-old daughter goodbye and reassured another child that she would return from the dead. The woman, whom The Associated Press isn't identifying because she is allegedly a victim of sexual assault, said Hughes helped unfurl the pool vacuum to make her death look accidental, and that Perez and Hughes then told her to wait in a nearby shop office with Hughes' daughter. She said she heard a splash and a scream, and that she trembled while she was holding the toddler. The woman said Perez's forearms were wet and he was out of breath when he came into the office, and that he told her to wait 20 minutes before going to the pool and getting into it with the toddler. She said he told her to then call the police and to tell investigators that Hughes fell and hit her head while trying to rescue her daughter. In addition to the murder charge, Perez faces charges of sexually exploiting a child, rape, sodomy, making criminal threats and lying on life insurance and auto credit forms. If convicted of the murder charge, Perez could be sentenced to life in prison. His attorney, Alice Osburn, did not respond to a phone message left Wednesday seeking comment. Witnesses have portrayed Perez as a domineering leader who kept a tight rein on his young, mostly female followers. Although he claimed to be able tell the future and possess other mystical powers, none of the preliminary testimony in the case has pointed to any religion or other social agenda uniting them. The bizarre case led investigators through a web of false identities and money that stretched through Texas, South Dakota, Missouri, Kansas and Tennessee . Several of the women testified about alleged sexual violence and their fear of him. Prosecutors say Perez and his followers lived lavishly off of life insurance payouts following the deaths of other commune members. Nobody has been accused of wrongdoing in those other deaths. Among them were a 2001 plane crash in South Dakota that killed a group member, her boyfriend and her 12-year-old daughter. Hughes' husband was killed in 2006 when a car jack failed and he was crushed in South Dakota. And a 2008 traffic accident killed another group member who had legal custody of Hughes' orphaned daughter. 'There is a pattern that members of a group associated with the person using the name of Lou Castro have followed of insuring members of the group and then living off the proceeds of the life insurance policies when one of them dies,' Mr Bauer wrote in a July 2010 filing seeking custody for the grandparents. The judge found that the girl was in 'imminent danger' and granted the maternal grandparents guardianship. Filings in that guardianship case in Kansas indicate detectives told the grandparents in 2010 that the man they knew as Lou Castro was in fact Perez, who had been convicted of sex crimes with a child in the 1990s but had fled before sentencing. Investigators also told the grandparents about the federal case filed against Perez in Kansas for aggravated identity theft. In that case, he was listed at the same address in Tennessee, more than 800 miles from Kansas, where their granddaughter was living at the time. Sedgwick County District Judge Warren Wilbert yesterday set bond at US$2 million pending a preliminary hearing on 2 February. The charges were initially filed in September but they were kept under seal while Perez finished serving a federal sentence for identity theft in Oklahoma before being extradited to Kansas to face the state charges. Perez's court-appointed attorney, Alice Osburn, did not immediately return a call from The Associated Press for comment. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Daniel U.

"The mother of a cancer-stricken teenager who passed away two days after fulfilling his last wish to take his girlfriend to the school prom said she is 'devastated and heartbroken'. Jak Trueman, 15, was applauded by tearful classmates at the school dance which was organised at the last minute after doctors told him he was dying last week. Thousands have now paid tribute to the young Rangers fan who kept his promise to take long-term girlfriend Hannah Boyd, 14, to West Calder High's prom in West Lothian, Scotland. His mother wrote on the Jak's Journey Facebook page earlier today, saying: 'Devastated and heartbroken to say my beautiful boy's gone to Heaven, God bless.

His long-term girlfriend Hannah also posted four hearts on the Facebook page after hearing the news that he had passed away. The teenager's condition deteriorated rapidly over the last couple of days and he needed pain relief to be able to attend his prom. He could only stay for 10 minutes at the dance which was held at Livingston Football Club near his home in Mid Calder as he started to feel unwell. After the event  he wrote a message saying: 'I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again. 'I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving.

'Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along, even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile.' He was diagnosed with terminal T-Cell Lymphoma in August last year and was in line to take more treatment until scans showed early last week the cancer had spread throughout his body. His mother revealed they were living 'minute by minute, hour by hour' desperate for him to improve. 'We will just take it minute by minute hour by hour,' she said. 'The prom was about my boy and Hannah. 'He managed to make the evening for 10 minutes through wonderful courage and determination.'

She added: 'Jak and Hannah are exceptionally close and I think it is absolutely magical that the school brought the prom forward, what they have done this for both of them . 'It is overwhelming what the school has arranged.' Jak  dedicated his last few days to raising cash for charity Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research and raised more than £33,000 in less than a week. 'A phenomenal amount for my phenomenal boy - making things a little easier knowing others will benefit,' Mrs Trueman added. He hoped to raise enough cash to set up the charity 'Team Jak' which will offer additional support for youngsters battling cancer. Jak was diagnosed with terminal T-Cell Lymphoma in August last year and vowed to use his last few days to raise money for charity . Breaking the news of his worsening condition to his friends, he said: 'Well, that's it. 'Worse case scenario has happened.

'My very experienced Doctors and Professors have looked at the PET scan from today and the disease has spread into all my bones and organs. 'They have decided not to go any further with any more treatment. 'I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it.

"She's the self-proclaimed selfie queen and recently announced  she is  releasing a book filled with hundreds of pictures of her own face. Now, in a new video for T-Mobile, Kim has dispensed some advice on how to take the perfect selfie. And it looks like you're going to need to put some time aside as the reality TV star's advice includes taking a whopping 300 photos. She loves a selfie: T-Mobile shared a selection of Kim's personal selfies on their Twitter today . Kim tries out a series of poses, such as putting her arms up, but she always like to keep her signature pout . When taking selfies Kim likes to hold her phone high above her head and tilt her chin down . In the clip Kim begins by saying: 'Hi I'm Kim Kardashian-West and I'm going to give you a little tutorial on how to take the perfect selfie.' She goes on to explain: 'If you don't have a mirror in front of you to figure out your pose and your angle make sure that the lighting is amazing because you want to blow out everything that you don't want to see and highlight all the good things that you do. 'For me I know my perfect angle it's my chin down and I just pose away and take about 300 photos until I get the perfect selfie.' Of course there is no one more passionate about the art of selfie taking than Kim. After all she is the woman who once describing taking photos of herself as, 'the purpose of life.'

And with 25.5million Instagram followers and a further 28.4million on Twitter it's little wonder that she wants to keep them impressed. Kim's selfie advice comes after her hilarious Super Bowl advert for the mobile company in which she mocks herself for her love of taking selfies. In what sounds like a spoof charity advert Kim says in a deadpan voice: 'Hi. I'm Kim. Each month millions of gigs of unused data are taken back by wireless companies. Tragic. 'Data you paid for that could be used to see my makeup, my backhand, my outfits, my vacation and my outfits.' However, whilst some people praised Kim for being able to take the mick out of herself, others criticised the ad. One twitter user said: 'I feel like T-Mobile doesn't have $4million to waste like that,' whilst another said, '#stopkim I just lost seconds from my life from that ad.'

"She's the pop star turned designer who proved her critics wrong by launching a successful  brand loved by A-listers and fashion editors alike. Victoria Beckham's collections get stronger each season and now, it looks like she's got yet another fashion hit on her hands. The womenswear designer has unveiled her spring/summer 2015 range from her Victoria, Victoria Beckham line - and it's full of Bauhaus-inspired print shirts, playsuits and classic shift dresses. Scroll down for video . Victoria Beckham has unveiled her SS15 Victoria, Victoria Beckham range - her sister line . Victoria, Victoria Beckham is described as 'the playful younger sister to the style icon's eponymous main line'. The mother-of-four's new campaign was shot in a gym in New York and each item has been designed to flatter the female form - something Mrs Beckham has made her signature. The vibrant and Japanese wave painting-inspired pieces, which are experimental in cut and texture, are a departure from the classic muted dresses she launched her design career with. Her latest drop of dresses come with gathered corset waists, plenty of ruffles and asymmetric hemlines. Prices range between £480 for a vibrant pink shift to £1,295 for a cami top and pleated midi combo. The range is full of Bauhaus-inspired print shirts, playsuits and classic shift dresses . The 40-year-old designer considers this range to be 'the playful younger sister' to her eponymous main line . The designer has incorporated spots, abstract prints and fluid shapes into the range . Speaking about her latest drop, fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Victoria Beckham's main line collections are terribly chic, streamlined and usually contain very little print. So it's always nice to see something completely different from her sister line, Victoria, Victoria Beckham. 'For spring summer 2015, there is more of the fluid, looser shapes that we've enjoyed from Victoria over the last couple of seasons. 'A nice move away from her super tailored pieces. And it's colour and print galore! Spots, abstract prints, orange and pink, and those gorgeous iridescent metallic skirts. Prices for the Victoria, Victoria Beckham line range between £480 and £1,295 . The mother-of-four's new campaign was shot in a gym in New York and is fresh and fun . 'Black is obviously present, it wouldn't be a Victoria Beckham collection without. But here, we're seeing more flesh on show, with a crop top and skirt combo. 'It seems the VVB girl isn't afraid of making a statement through her wardrobe, and for spring she's channeling an uber-cool rock chick with a bit of sophistication thrown in.' The collection comes after Victoria showed her witty side starring in Vogue.com's 73 Questions series. As part of the fashion bible's video interview series she revealed her favourite drink, her best fashion secret and why she never smiles - and became an online sensation. She has also helped boost the sales of a fledgling business after posting a snap of her wearing a football backpack on Instagram. Husband and wife team Tony, 44, and Chloe Brown, 42, launched Sportpax - a range of sports backpacks - in November 2014. The designer has added iridescent metallic pleated skirts to the range, which are worn with a cami top . Victoria Beckham, pictured with the award for Brand of the Year during the 2014 British Fashion Awards, has come a long way since her Spice Girl days . On a whim they sent a £24.99 bag to Victoria and admit they never really expected it to come to anything. However, on Wednesday they woke to an influx of messages about the bag after the designer shared the snap online. Tony and Chloe had barely got their social media accounts live at the time, but have since rushed to let the social media spheres know who they are. Their plan is to also launch rugby, cricket and tennis versions. They're in talks with a number of retailers to sell the bags in stores across the country and believe the potential for partnerships with sporting businesses and clubs is 'huge'.

"The Islamic State's leadership in Syria and Iraq has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes, leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, it is claimed. Allied airstrikes, including those carried out by British warplanes, have killed more than 6,000 fighters since September, including more than half the militants serving on ISIS' ruling council. Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq. His death and that of as many as nine others on ISIS' 18-man leadership council have forced Baghdadi to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders, as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle-hardened loyalists becomes increasingly small. Scroll down for video . Pressure: The Islamic State's leadership in Syria and Iraq has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes, leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) Dead: Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (left), a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq. Another former member of Saddam Hussein's army turned ISIS commander, Abu Musa al-Alwani (right), has also been killed . Terror: ISIS' leadership has been left in chaos following the deaths of many of its senior commanders . Baghdadi has not been seen in public since July and there have been numerous unconfirmed reports that he suffered serious injury or possibly even death as a result of targeted airstrikes. The likelihood, however, is that Baghdadi has been forced deep into  hiding to avoid being targeted by jets that have destroyed more than 1,000 vehicles used by terrorists over the past five months. Other senior figures within the terror group have not been afforded that luxury and still need to travel across the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq that remain under ISIS' control. This forces them to make a decision whether to move as part of a large military convoy and risk being spotted by warplanes overhead, or whether to use cars that reduce the likelihood of aerial detection but leave them at risk of kidnap or killing at the hands if ISIS' rivals on the ground. Targeted: Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi (left) - who had been the head of Baghdadi's four man military council - was killed by a coalition warplane last year. Another militant reportedly killed in an airstrike was Abu Hajar Al-Sufi (right) who had been one of Baghdadi's most trusted advisers on the Shura Council . Despite the serious damage done to ISIS' leadership by the airstrikes, scores of prominent militants remain alive, including the terror group's British executioner in chief, Jihadi John . Among the ISIS leadership figures killed in airstrikes in recent months is Abu Musa al-Alwani, according to the Sun. Another former member of Saddam Hussein's army, Abu Musa - real name Waleed Jassem al-Alwani - had been a prominent member of ISIS' military council before his death. Also killed by coalition airstrikes last year was Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi - who had been the head of Baghdadi's four man military council, having previously served on the terror leader's religious and strategic advisory body, known as the Shura Council. Another militant reportedly killed by the first wave of coalition airstrikes in September was Abu Hajar Al-Sufi, also known as Abu Hajar al-Assafi, who had been one of Baghdadi's most trusted advisers on the Shura Council. His death came two months before that of Abu Jurnas. real name Rathwan Talib Hussein Ismail al-Hamdani, whose official title was believed to have been Governor of 'Border Provinces'. Abu Jurnas' role was to ensure ISIS' barbaric interpretation of Sharia law was enforced along the Syria-Iraq crossing, and to ensure that the nations' respective armies are unable to reestablish the border that was effectively wiped out by the terror group's lightning advance last summer. Other well-known militants still alive and operational include Abu Wahib, the terror group's 28-year-old leader in Iraq's Anbar province (right), Abu Omar al-Shishani, another 28-year-old, who is understood to be responsible for ISIS' military operations within Syria . Abu Wahib's distinctive thick black beard has ensured he has been used prominently in ISIS propaganda . While many local tribal leaders are in favour of a Sunni Muslim caliphate, their allegiances remain largely tribal and they are not seen as entrenched supporters of ISIS (pictured) Baghdadi is likely to have replaced Abu Jurnas with another of his trusted lieutenants, but in less strategically important regions he is understood to have been forced to appoint local warlords to the role of senior commander as his inner circle of loyalists dwindles. While many of these local tribal leaders are in favour of a Sunni Muslim caliphate and their opposition to the Syrian and Iraqi regimes confirmed, their allegiances remain largely tribal and they are not seen as entrenched supporters of the Baghdadi-led group. Long-standing tensions between the tribes has also surfaced as they battle for regional prominence and advantage, causing chaos with ISIS ranks. Despite the serious damage done to ISIS' leadership by the airstrikes, scores of prominent militants remain alive, including the terror group's British executioner in chief, Jihadi John. Although he is unlikely to hold a senior position within the group's leadership, his death would be highly symbolic in the battle to defeat ISIS due to his in the deaths of British, American and Japanese aid workers and journalists. Over the weekend ISIS' British executioner in chief, Jihadi John, savagely murdered Japanese journalist Kenji Goto in a shocking filmed beheading after days of intensive negotiations through intermediaries to save him . Mr Goto joined a list of other victims, including fellow Japanese national Haruna Yukawa (left). British aid workers David Haines (centre), and Alan Henning (right) have also been murdered . US journalist James Foley (left) was the first to appear alongside Jihadi John in one of the sickening videos, followed by Steven Sotloff (centre. Aid worker Peter Kassig (right) is also dead . Other well-known militants still alive and operational include Abu Wahib, the terror group's 28-year-old leader in Iraq's Anbar province, whose distinctive thick black beard has ensured he has been used prominently in ISIS propaganda. Another is Abu Omar al-Shishani, another 28-year-old, who is understood to be responsible for ISIS' military operations within Syria. Before joining ISIS Georgian-born Shishani led the terror group Jaish al-Muhajireen wal Ansar in operations against the Syrian regime, but declared his allegiance to Baghdadi last year. He had previously been a member of the Georgian army, but left ahead of his promotion to officer.","Allied airstrikes decimate ISIS' leadership, leaving terror group in chaos .

"A prostitute  entered a suite in a Paris hotel and saw Dominique Strauss-Kahn being ‘taken care of’ by up to eight women, it is alleged. The testimony is part of the prosecution evidence being used to try the disgraced former International Monetary Fund chief for ‘aggravated pimping’. His trial for allegedly taking part in an international prostitution ring, which began yesterday in Lille, will include details of what Sandrine Vandenschrik says she witnessed at the four-star Murano Hotel. In the dock: Ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn (centre) with co-defendants Emmanuel Riglaire (left), Jean-Christophe Lagarde (second left) and French businessman Fabrice Paszkowski (second right) at Lille courthouse on the first day of the trial . Serious faced: Strauss-Kahn (centre) and his lawyer Henri Leclerc (left) leave Lille courthouse after the first day of the trial . ‘I was shocked – I didn’t want to get involved in this carnage,’ she said in a police interview that forms part of hundreds of pages of evidence submitted by prosecutors. Strauss-Kahn, 65, insists he did not know his lovers were call girls, but Miss Vandenschrik told police: ‘He really wants us to believe he’s naive and takes us for idiots.’ He faces up to a decade in prison and a £1million-plus fine in a case which shines a light on some of the seediest corners of French public life. Strauss-Kahn, dressed in a black suit and tie, appeared alongside 13 co-defendants, including one known as ‘Dodo the pimp’. Stauss Kahn leaves the courthouse on the first day of his trial in Lille. He is accused of sex offences including the alleged procuring of prostitutes . A prostitute has claimed she saw Dominique Strauss Kahn (file picture) being 'taken care of' by up to eight woman in a Paris hotel . Looking tired and drawn, he stared at the floor constantly, only occasionally taking part in whispered conversations with his lawyers. Strauss-Kahn is said to have attended orgies in cities all over the world in which politicians, police chiefs and captains of industry enjoyed the services of highly paid prostitutes. He admits having a huge sexual appetite and attending what he described as ‘libertine’ parties, but denies knowing that any of the girls were prostitutes, saying it was impossible to tell what they did professionally because they were all naked. It is not illegal to pay for sex in France, but it is against the law to solicit or to run a prostitution business. Defendants  Dominique Alderweireld or 'Dodo the pimp' (second right) and his partner and associate Beatrice Legrain (second left) at court . Former IMF head Strauss-Kahn (partially seen in backseat of car arriving for the start of a trial in the so-called Carlton Affair) is accused of 'aggravated pimping' in the northern French city of Lille . DSK, as he is known, was head of the Washington-based IMF between 2007 and 2011, and was considered a shoo-in to become French president as the Socialist Party’s candidate in 2012. But his career collapsed in 2011 when a chambermaid at a New York hotel accused him of attempting to rape her. While those charges were dropped and the case settled in a civil suit, DSK soon faced equally depraved allegations. Miss Vandenschrik and other women accused DSK – who was married to journalist and art heiress Anne Sinclair at the time of the alleged offences – of attending orgies not only in Paris, but also close to the IMF offices in Washington. Other witnesses at the orgies described DSK in the height of ‘pure sexual consummation’, with women all over his writhing body. The trial is expected to last for three weeks, with DSK giving evidence next week. Dominique Alderweireld (right) nicknamed 'Dodo the pimp, and his companion Beatrice Legrain arrive on the first day of a trial in the so-called Carlton Affair, in Lille,  where 14 people including former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn stand accused of sex offences including the alleged procuring of prostitutes .

Police officers conduct security searches with a sniffer dog at the Lille courthouse, northern France, prior to the start of the  trial . Once tipped to become the next president of France, Dominique Strauss Kahn became the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, IMF, in 2007. But the powerful French lawyer and politician's was left in tatters after he was accused of raping a chambermaid at a New York hotel in 2011. Nafissatou Diallo, 32, alleged that Strauss Kahn had assaulted her when she entered his room. The case later collapsed because of problems surrounding the credibility of the witness and he settled out of court. He resigned from the IMF on 18 May 2011 but a series of sordid revelations about Strauss Khan's sex life were too follow. Journalist Tristane Banon came forward during the case claiming that Strauss Kahn had attempted to rape her. He admitted trying to kiss her but in October 2011, prosecutors dropped the case over lack of evidence. The following year, Strauss Kahn came under investigation over his alleged involvement in a prostitution ring which was linked to hiring prostitutes for sex parties at hotels in Lille, Paris and Washington. Charges of gang rape in Washington were dropped in October 2012 after the alleged victim told police they were playing consensual 'sex games'. In July 2013, the shamed former IMF boss was told he would stand trial over allegations of 'aggravated pimping' at the Carlton Hotel in Lille, France in a case which would later become known as the Carlton Affair. The scandal-struck life of Strauss Kahn was the inspiration for film Welcome to New York - featuring 'Gérard Depardieu as Devereaux, a character modeled on D.S.K.","Dominique Strauss-Kahn is on trial for 'aggravated pimping' in Lille, France .

"Legal trouble: John Attanasio, a former dean of Southern Methodist University Law School, has been arrested on a misdemeanor prostitution charge . A former dean of Southern Methodist University Law School has been arrested on a misdemeanor prostitution charge. John Attanasio, 60, was taken into custody Sunday by Texas Department of Public Safety troopers and booked into the Collin County Jail. The North Dallas resident, who is married with two grown sons, was later released after posting $500 bond. Attanasio served as dean of SMU's law school between 1998 and 2013, when his contract expired and was not renewed. A graduate of the prestigious New York University and Yale schools of law, Attanasio has retained his position as SMU's Judge William Hawley Atwell Chair of Constitutional Law. The law school has declined to comment on the constitutional law professor's legal trouble. Law enforcement officials also are keeping mum about the circumstances of Attanasio's Sunday arrest citing an ongoing investigation, reported the Dallas Morning News. According to his profile on the website of NYU Law School, where Attanasio is listed as a Distinguished Visiting Fellow, the 60-year-old jurisprudence expert has received a number of professional distinctions over the course of his long career, including a Fulbright scholarship and an Outstanding Faculty Member Award from Notre Dame Law School. Ousted: Attanasio, a prominent constitutional scholar, served as dean of SMU's law school between 1998 and 2013, when his contract expired and was not renewed . Distinguished career: Attanasio, a graduate of the prestigious New York University and Yale schools of law, has retained his position as SMU's Judge William Hawley Atwell Chair of Constitutional Law . According to his NYU Law biography, since 1995, the former dean has co-organized seven summits between justices of the US Supreme Court and their counterparts in Europe. Attanasio's ouster in January 2013 caused an outrage among alumni, faculty members, financial supporters and the school's executive committee, who were upset that Provost Paul Ludden did not provide any explanation for his decision not to renew the dean's contract. Attanasio has been described as a very effective fundraiser for the school who helped bring in more than $115million in gifts and pledges over the years. In good company: Last February, Attanasio (far right) co-organized a summit between US Supreme Court Justices and judges from the European Court of Justice. Pictured (L to R) are Justices Samuel Alito and Stephen Breyer; Professor George Bermann; Retired Justice Sandra Day O’Connor; Chief Justice John Roberts; Professor Daniel Halberstam; Professor Gráinne de Búrca; Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg; Professor Sarah Cleveland and Professor Harold Koh . However, not everyone was reportedly sorry to see Attanasio booted from his position as dean. The legal blog Above the Law in January 2013 quoted an unnamed SMU student as saying that Attanasio was infamous for his arrogance, unpopular among his peers and widely mocked for his inability to use a computer.","John Attanasio was arrested Sunday by Texas Department of Public Safety troopers on misdemeanor prostitution charge .

Brady's fourth Super Bowl win equals the quarterback record set by his boyhood hero Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49ers and Terry Bradshaw of the Pittsburgh Steelers. But the Californian is not ready to enter discussions about where he places among the all-time greats in the league. 'I've never thought much about that. I am still kind of in the midst of my career. I just love the game. I love playing. I love representing our team,' he said. 'All the guys work really hard. It's a big commitment that a lot of players make to play this game, and it's a lot of sacrifices and a lot of support from a lot of people that love you and support you.

While Brady is clearly the most successful quarterback still playing the game, he risked on Sunday a third Super Bowl loss after two defeats to the New York Giants and that was something on his mind in the latter stages of the thriller. 'We've been on the other end of this two times in the last seven years, being ahead late in the game with the chance to win it, and not closing it out. I'm glad we had the opportunity to do it.

"A post office thief who stole the shop's takings to sail the world on luxury cruises while her best friend the postmistress fed her family on mouldy bread has been spared jail. Mother-of-four Diane Lathlean, 50, was convicted of stealing £3,050 of stock from the post office in Ampleforth, North Yorkshire where she worked as a part-time shelf stacker and counter assistant. She enjoyed cruises around Hawaii and the Bahamas, while her unsuspecting boss, and friend Fiona Senior, 48, was forced to sacrifice her own pay to keep the retail side of the business afloat. Post office thief Diane Lathlean (left) stole the shop's takings to sail the world on luxury cruises while her best friend, postmistress Fiona Senior (right with husband Paul) fed her family on mouldy bread . Magistrates found Lathlean guilty of stealing the stock between 2008 and 2012 in December, but sent the case to Crown Court as they did not feel the maximum six month prison sentence they could impose would be sufficient. However, she was given a suspended six month sentence when she appeared before York Crown Court on Friday. Mrs Senior and her husband Paul, 45, had already received a £28,000 settlement for alleged theft of money and goods by Lathlean in a civil case prior to her trial. The couple had employed Lathlean to work 14 and a half hours a week, and paid her £6.10 an hour. But while she cruised around the Mediterranean, and spent Christmas in California, they lived off mouldy bread and Mrs Senior gave up her salary in a bid to keep the business going. Lathlean also enjoyed regular beauty treatments and was a Tottenham Hotspur season ticket holder, travelling all over the country staying in hotels, her victims said. Mrs Senior had refused to believe her best friend was to blame as the post office and village shop teetered on the brink of ruin. Mr Senior became suspicious when 'appalling' takings at the Ampleforth Post Office (pictured) suddenly flourished after Lathlean booked herself on a three-week voyage to Panama . But Mr Senior became suspicious when 'appalling' takings suddenly flourished after Lathlean went on a three-week voyage to Panama. Meanwhile, they collected coupons towards a cheap break at Haven’s Haggerston Castle Caravan Park in Northumberland. 'She was systematically stealing from our business while keeping a smile on her face,' Mrs Senior told the judge at York Crown Court. 'I totally trusted her. I thought she was my best friend in the village. Little did I realise her hidden agenda.' Mr Senior had told the original trial that he and his wife had 'inherited' Lathlean when they took over the post office and shop in 2008. Lathlean was handed a six month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work . She had worked in the shop under the store’s previous owners - who had also struggled to make ends meet, he added. The court heard that Lathlean knew most of the people in the small village and had served them for more than 20 years. By 2012, local businesses - seeing the store was getting run down - clubbed together to pay for a refurbishment, which included CCTV. When Mr Senior checked the footage, he was amazed to see Lathlean wandering around the empty shop slipping all manner of goods in her bag or dropping them into a drawer to retrieve later. Mr Senior told the court he believed the true loss was more like £50,000, and he had long suspected his employee had been stealing. He added: 'It stuck out a lot more when Diane was on holiday. We could afford to pay our bills when she was on holiday. 'I suspected after a while there was something wrong. But because Diane was Fiona’s best friend she just would not hear of it.' Julian Tanikal, mitigating for Lathlean, of Geldgate, Ampleforth, claimed the cruises were funded by her husband Simon who worked for American Express. Scarborough Magistrates' Court could have jailed Lathlean for six months but presiding magistrate Carl Harwood had said: 'The offence is so serious you need greater punishment than we can give you. 'You were entrusted to run the business while the owners were away. We cannot see there would be any higher degree of trust.' The Seniors were stunned when the judge at Crown Court gave Lathlean a six month jail sentence suspended for two years. She was also ordered to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work, pay £300 court costs and an £80 surcharge. Lathlean, who has already repaid the Seniors £3,050 for the stock, showed no emotion when sentence was passed. The court was told she has a previous criminal record for theft from an employer in 1989. After the sentence, Mrs Senior stormed that it 'made a mockery' of the magistrates' decision. 'I do feel that this was an extremely light sentence bearing in mind it is not the first conviction for theft from an employer,' she said after the hearing. 'However, the justice system is the law of the land and we have to abide by this. 'Both the civil case settlement and the guilty verdict can now give us closure on the matter. 'From the bottom of our hearts, we would also like to thank the local community for their tremendous support.' The couple have a disabled daughter, Eleanor, 13, who suffers from the rare genetic disorder Prader-Willi syndrome, and another daughter Jennifer, 11. Mrs Senior added: 'We were eating mouldy bread and buying second hand Christmas presents from charity shops. 'I was devastated when I found out what Diane had been doing. She was my best friend, and the best friend of the people who had the shop before us. 'I just sank and went to bed for four days. Now I don’t even want to be in the same room as her.' Mr Senior said: 'I don’t know why she got such a light sentence. We are just glad it’s over because it’s been a very stressful time. 'The business is thriving now and all the problems it had are over. The customers are disgusted at what Lathlean did. 'Most are just happy their village post office and shop are still here. They nearly went to the wall. At least we can move on now. 'She went on at least ten cruises while we were on the rocks. 'At one stage we were only a week from going under and I had to take a second job as a chimney sweep to prop the business up. 'We put £43,000 into the business while we lived like paupers and she was cruising the world.'","Diane Lathlean convicted of stealing £3,050 worth of stock from post office .

"A few weeks is nothing in the context of the ancient existence of the Amazon's Awa-Guaja people, but in his short time one photographer managed to capture the everyday life of a tribe considered the most endangered in the world. Daniel Rodrigues created a breathtaking collection of images depicting the beauty and brutality of their troubled existence. The Awa-Guaja tribes are critically under threat from loggers and grazing farmers keen to decimate their pocket of the vast Brazilian rainforest and through desperation have only in recent decades come out of their centuries of avoiding contact with westerners - some remain uncontacted by white people. Kiby (face obscured), of the Awa-Guaja tribe in the Brazilian Amazon, carries a red jaguar on her back after a hunt in the rainforest . Awa-Guaja hunter Aiwxa'a brandishes a stick while a red puma refuses to give up the fight after be hit by two bullets from a shotgun . Photographer Daniel Rodrigues got remarkable access to the daily life of the tribe, and was forced to communicate via hand gestures . Senior hunters Jakare and Majhuxa'a stand with stern faces and shot guns after successfully hunting down a monkey for their family . An intimate family moment captured by Rodrigues as uoung mother Panapinuhum breastfeeds her son Arywi in the river Caru . In a scene that could be from anywhere in the world, Piraima'a washes clothes in the river as children bath around him . The French-born photographer, based in Portugal, travels the world to snap incredible black and white and colour images, documenting them on his site DanielRodriguesPhoto.com, but had never come across a tribe so untouched by modern life before. While their nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle requires a level of bravery and enterprise many westerners will never comprehend, Portugal-based Rodrigues found a friendly and welcoming people despite needing to rely on hand gestures for communication. The tribe, which numbers around 350 people, first adopted a nomadic lifestyle to avoid confrontations with invading Europeans and have successfully lived in the Amazon ever since. His journey to the eastern Amazon in the wet season last year saw Rodrigues join hunting missions in dense foliage for periods that would equate to a day and half of office work for a westerner. The tribes people hunted indigenous red puma, Capuchin monkey and other land animals, and fished their plentiful rivers for fish and poraque (electric eels) for their fully self-sustained existence that they are in serious danger of losing without help in their battle against loggers. With the ultimate playground at their disposal, some would say, the kids of the Awa-Guaja tribe play in the river Juriti in the village Tiracambu . Hakoain is only a recent discovery for the outside world having connected 10 years ago - she stands with her son Mayra . Young boy Aparyta stands comfortably with a native monkey he keeps as a pet asleep on his head - the tribe also hunt monkeys for food . Muturuhum draws back his bow and arrow. While having limited access to guns, in many cases the tribe prefers traditional hunting methods . Majhuxa'a prefers a fire to cook food on the move during a day of hunting - no firelighters here . Pytyra pokes his head out the door of her house, made from leaves and branches found in the forest, in the village Guaja . Little Ariwa decides this carves canoe is the best place to take a nap in the village Juriti in the eastern Amazon . In some rare good news for the tribes, Survival International reported in April last year that  the Awá and their supporters celebrated the Brazilian government's move to send in troops to remove illegal loggers from Awá land. The military intervention in the states of Para and Maranhao is just the beginning though with the Amazon such an incredibly vast area that is tough to defend. Young, strong and toned, Marimy looks at peace as he takes a bath in the river near the village Guajá in Alto Turiacu . With the face of a life well lived, Takwarexa'a is one of the elderly residents of the Awa Guaja indigenous tribe in the village of Juriti . Sabia, seemingly without a care in the world, plays with the overhanging vines in the river Igarapa in the village Tiracamba . The greatest threat to the ancient tribes of the Awa-Guaja is loggers, who have resorted to violence in their bid to decimate the forest . Aparyta and Hemokoma'a survey the damage inflicted by loggers on their land that the Brazil government is now trying to help protect .

In 2013, he won the World Press Photo Daily Life category with a image of footballers in Guinea Bissau.","The Brazilian Amazon's Awa-Guaja people are under threat from loggers and farmers wanting land .

"Most people undertake a total life overhaul after some kind of dramatic event such as a near-death experience or the birth of a child. However one woman  transformed herself by creating a bucket list, simply because her life 'sucked'. Fed-up Laura Lawson, 26, from Portlethen, Aberdeenshire, decided to change her life because she didn't want to be lying on her deathbed full of regrets. Scroll down for video . Laura was 'fat, sad and lonely' and would comfort eat and drink every weekend (left) but now (right) has lost an 3st 2lb through carrying out all her sporty challenges around the world and improving her diet . Laura set herself the task to totally transform her life, completing numerous challenges such as sky diving . A major change in her life has been her marriage to husband David, 29, in Las Vegas last September . Laura's inventive bucket list has included para sailing (left) and a helicopter ride (right) 'I was 23 years old and wasting my life away, and at 14st I didn't even recognise my own reflection,' she said. 'The last five years were spent drinking every weekend, eating anything I could get my hands on and spending every evening locked in my room playing the Xbox. 'I tried to figure what had happened to me. Blaming everything on everyone else. My work sucked, my life sucked, I was fat, sad, lonely. Determined to change, she made a New Year's resolution in 2012 to get out of her rut. Since then she has got married, bought a house, lost weight - and completed 120 exciting challenges which have taken her around the world, helped her lose 3st 2lb in weight and seen her get married. She has also managed to get a qualification and change her career, securing work as a buyer in the oil and gas industry. One of the challenges Laura undertook was to feed a rhino (pictured), which she did at San Diego zoo . Laura set out to try new experiences, like using a jet pack (pictured) as she didn't  want to live with regrets . Laura has experienced hair-raising rides (left) and shooting (right), and will be travelling to Mexico and California next where she plans to swim with sharks . She said: 'I came up with every excuse until I realised only I could change my life. Sitting feeling sorry for myself wasn't doing any good.' The former administration worker wrote down a list and started off small by climbing a hill, dyeing her hair pink and growing vegetables. And the satisfaction she gained from crossing off every activity inspired the idea for a bucket list. She kicked off the challenge with a bungee jump. Laura has even managed to take her husband David, 29,  - who she married in Las Vegas last September - on the journey with her. Laura, pictured snorkeling on one of her challenges, says she is much happier now . She said: 'I met him before I started this and he has been dragged along on everything. I think he thinks I am trying to kill him with all the things I do. 'I think he got a bit of a fright at first but now he is glad he is joining in.' 1. Dye hair pink . 2. Feed a rhino . 3. Sky diving . 4. Bungee jump . 5. Fly in a helicopter . 6. Climb a hill . 7. Swim with sharks . 8. Go in a submarine . 9. Visit a nudist beach . 10. Horse riding . Laura has lost an impressive 3st 2lb through carrying out all her sporty challenges and eating more healthily. She even bought her wedding dress three sizes smaller to encourage herself to slim down for her big day last year. Laura said she is much happier now and glad that her life has changed. She said: 'The thought of being on my deathbed having spent my whole life like I had been scared me, and I wanted no regrets. 'I don't drink any more. I think about better things to spend my money on and don't want to spend weekends with a hangover. 'I've lost a lot of weight and I've met new friends.' This year, Laura is heading to Mexico and California to cross more off the list. She plans to swim with sharks, go in a submarine, visit a nudist beach and go horse riding. She has completed 120 of her 300 challenges so far, including a bungee jump and parasail and has flown in a helicopter, fed a rhino and stroked a baby lion.","Oil and gas worker, 26, spent weekends eating, drinking and playing Xbox .
