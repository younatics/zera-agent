"While President Barack Obama discussed the need to fix the nation's immigration problems during his inauguration speech last week, Sister Cathy Buster is already doing something about it. She was all smiles at Wednesday's grand opening of Casa San Juan Bosco, a ""green"" affordable housing development that will give Florida farmworkers unprecedented access to a safe and healthy place to live. ""I dream a lot, and people all think I'm nuts when I tell them what I intend to do to help,"" said Buster, a member of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary of the Woods Congregation. ""But when they see events like today and realize I can help make it happen, this is wonderful."" Hired farmworkers continue to be one of the most economically disadvantaged groups in the United States, according to the USDA. Studies show they also face higher than average occupational hazards as well as a poorer health status overall. Many live in substandard housing without access to refrigeration or safe water. Typical homes are filled with mold or pests. Few have safe spaces for workers' children to play.  Buster vowed to change that trend. ""Health is a major issue where many of these families currently live"" -- sets of trailers, she said. ""The water alone is a real problem.  They aren't on city water, and the health department has to go out there two and three times a week to test it because it hasn't always been safe for them to use."" Trailer living isn't cheap, either. Many are charged $35 per person per day, she said. With two and three families living there, the rent costs more than many luxury apartments. ""It's outrageous,"" Buster said. The housing situation became much worse in 2004.  That's when Hurricane Charley ripped through Arcadia, Florida. Working with Catholic Charities to provide food and clothing to these workers immediately after the storm, Buster said she saw firsthand how devastating it was for the community. ""The little bit they had, they lost, and their deplorable living conditions got even worse,"" she said. ""The trailers that did survive, they put together. They had blankets for roofs and cardboard for walls.  Some 800 farmworkers were displaced."" Baby boomer nuns help revolutionize health care . Buster said she had never written a grant application in her life, but she knew she would need to raise the money, so she learned. She did know how to find the right location for better housing for the workers.  That's because at  age  60, she went back to school to earn her real estate license.  She had been handling all the real estate transactions for the Diocese of Venice since 1999, but then Hurricane Charley struck.  That's when Catholic Charities hired her away to help the district recover from the major amount of devastation.  Building Casa San Juan Bosco became their first project. It took 7½ years to gather enough money through donations and successful federal and local grant applications, but she eventually raised the $10 million to build the affordable housing. ""It was providence,"" she said. She got the land from a family of real estate agents who have been in Arcadia for more than 100 years. The property owner, Buster said, told people she was ""like a dog with a bone"" and called her ""the Donald Trump of the Sisters of Providence."" ""He's right, I did talk him out of a lot of land,"" Buster said, laughing.  ""It's about 20 acres."" The land will help house more than 50 families in single-family three- and four-bedroom homes with two bathrooms.  The homes come equipped with dishwashers, a range, a refrigerator, a microwave, a garbage disposal and a full-sized washer and dryer.   They are sturdy homes built to stand up to 200 mph winds. ""I was taking an inspector through who said they would be the safest residences in the county,"" Buster said.  ""They'll also be some of the nicest many of these families have ever seen."" ""I was taking a family on a tour, and one of the young women who had her grandmother and 2-year-old in tow said to them, 'Ooh, this is a real house,' "" Buster said. ""When she saw the washer and dryer she said, 'How much is this going to cost to do your laundry?' I told her it won't cost anything. 'But does it take quarters?' she asked. I told her there are no slot machines. These are yours to use. She was blown away.  I can't wait to see people's faces when they move in."" The property has parks and a playing field big enough for a soccer game.  ""Another family touring the grounds asked,  'Are the children allowed to play out here?' I told them they can do anything they want. They are safe here,"" Buster said. The grounds will also house a community center with a computer lab, a space that will offer English classes, monthly health check-ups and health classes.  There will be an after-school program and on-site day care. The homes will rent for about 30% of a family's income.  To be eligible to live in them, at least 50% of the farm laborer's income for the previous 12 months must be from a farm laborer occupation, and each member of the family must have U.S. citizenship or proof that they have been legally admitted for permanent residence. Programs like this are a huge help to the health of the community, according to University of Arizona economist George Frisvold, who specializes in agricultural issues.  He co-wrote a study that found that ""adverse living conditions significantly increase the probability of gastrointestinal, respiratory and muscular problems."" It also adds to a worker's stress level, which can lead to depression and other mental health complications. ""Even the more conservative economists who have looked at these kind of measures say to reduce the negative effects of child poverty, a project like this ends up paying for itself in the long run,"" Frisvold said. ""You basically eliminate a lot of costs to society that they would face down the road if there was no intervention.  Improve the conditions in which they live by changing cramped and unhealthy settings for healthy ones -- and those families will tend to do much better."" ""Having access to healthy housing is a very difficult problem for a lot of farmworkers. That really is something that is bellow the radar,"" said Don Villarejo, who works as a consultant on migrant health issues and has won several awards. ""This development is what I'd call a wonderful kind of experiment that I believe will result in a safe, affordable and decent housing model -- one that I'd like to see a much larger commitment to from the government, philanthropy and the private sector. It's crucial to the health and well-being of these workers."" Buster would agree. She already dreams of expanding. She wants to raise more money to build a kitchen that she has already designed in the community center. Down the road, she'd like to build affordable senior housing for low-income residents on the property. ""These families have worked and struggled all their lives,"" she said.  ""We can help them realize their dream, which is the American dream, I want to provide as many people as I can with a safe place to call home.""","Hired farmworkers are one of the most economically disadvantaged U.S. groups .

"Children with severe respiratory illnesses are flooding the emergency room of USA Children's and Women's Hospital in Mobile, Alabama, according to CNN affiliate WPMI. Doctors started noticing an increase in children with severe colds and troubling breathing in mid-August, said Dr. Jason Richerson, medical director of USA Children's & Women's Evaluation Center. Since then, more than 340 children have been treated at the hospital. Around 45 of them were admitted. What parents should know about EV-D68 . Doctors told WPMI that these patients are usually in the hospital for one to two days; others are being treated and released the same day. Enteroviruses are quite common in September; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10 to 15 million people are infected by these viruses each year. But doctors believe a particular type of enterovirus, Enterovirus D68, is causing more problems this fall than in years past. Enterovirus D68 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children with asthma, which is leading to more hospitalizations. As of September 11,  more than 80 people in six states have been confirmed to have respiratory illness caused by EV-D68, according to the CDC. These states are Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky and Missouri. List of states with Enterovirus . The virus is hard to track, as so many enteroviruses cause similar symptoms, and hospitals generally do not test for specific types. The Alabama Department of Public Health has not confirmed any cases of Enterovirus D68, but has sent samples to the CDC for testing. ""We do not expect results for one to two weeks,"" the department told CNN. Other states, including Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah and Washington, are still investigating clusters of respiratory illnesses. Several have sent samples to the CDC for testing. On Thursday, health officials in Washington state said they were working with Seattle Children's Hospital to investigate a group of patients who had tested positive for a possible enterovirus infection. The King County Department of Public Health has sent samples to the CDC to see whether the virus at fault is Enterovirus D68. ""Although we can't currently say that these cases are definitely due to EV-D68, it would not be surprising if the virus is confirmed on further testing,"" Dr. Jeff Duchin, chief of communicable disease and epidemiology at the department, said in a statement. Enteroviruses usually present like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. Most people recover without any treatment. But if your child appears to be having trouble breathing, take him or her to a doctor right away.","More than 340 children have been treated at a hospital in Mobile, Alabama .

"(CNN)Indianapolis Colts backup linebacker Josh McNary has been charged with felony rape, a spokeswoman for the Marion County, Indiana, Prosecutor's Office said Wednesday. McNary, 26, was in police custody late Wednesday at the Marion County Jail, a booking log on the jail website said. McNary was also charged with felony criminal confinement and misdemeanor battery resulting in bodily injury. According to a probable cause affidavit, a 29-year-old woman reported to police on the morning of December 1 that she was raped hours earlier at the apartment of a man she met while out at a bar. She said she told the man several times she didn't want to have sex and fought with him, scratching him on the face, neck, back and shoulder. The man forced her to have sex on his bed, she told police. She took the man's cell phone as she left the apartment. A forensic nurse examined the woman and found injuries to her vagina and dried blood behind one ear. The document indicates detectives used the cell phone to identify McNary the next day. He was cooperative, police indicated, and he asked for a lawyer after being advised of his rights. A nurse found abrasions and scratches on his stomach, back, neck and shoulder, the document says. Investigators also found the woman's clothing and an earring in McNary's apartment. CNN's attempts to reach McNary's attorney weren't immediately successful. The Colts said they were aware of media reports about the incident. ""But unfortunately that's the limit of our knowledge,"" the Colts said in a written statement. ""At this time, we are very concerned and trying to find out what the relevant facts are, but we have insufficient information to venture any opinion.  As we learn more, we will make appropriate updates."" The National Football League said the matter is ""under review."" Recently, the NFL revised its Personal Conduct Policy. It includes a minimum six-game suspension for crimes involving violent conduct, including domestic violence and sexual assault. The league reviewed its stance after widespread criticism of its handling of the Ray Rice case. McNary is listed as a second-string inside linebacker for the Colts, who play the New England Patriots on Sunday in the AFC championship game. He has 28 tackles -- mostly on special teams -- in 15 games this season. He played in the Colts game on November 30 and had one tackle on punt coverage. The 6-foot, 251-pound player is in his second season. He played collegiate football at Army and served in the military from 2011 to 2013 before joining the Colts.

"(CNN) -- The suspicious powder inside a swastika-adorned package sent to an Arizona congressman is ""nontoxic,"" an FBI spokesman said Friday. Staffers checking mail in the Tucson, Arizona, office of U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva on Thursday found a white, powdery substance and drawings of two swastikas inside an envelope, Grijalva campaign spokesman Adam Sarvana told CNN. Almost a dozen people were in the office when the incident happened around 12:30 p.m. Thursday (3:30 p.m. ET), he said. All of them were checked on-scene by local authorities and sent home. Scientists at an FBI laboratory in Phoenix, Arizona, conducted a full analysis of the substance, according to Sarvana. Those tests came back negative midday Friday, according to FBI Special Agent Manuel Johnson. Johnson said the FBI would have no further comments, as ""the investigation is ongoing."" U.S. Capitol Police are also participating in the investigation, according to Sgt Kimberly Schneider, a spokeswoman for the force. The incident was the third security issue at Grijalva's district offices this year, Sarvana said. ""It's just a continuation of a problem we've been having,"" Grijalva told CNN affiliate KVOA. In April, the congressman closed two local offices for an afternoon after receiving threats regarding his position on controversial immigration legislation. And in July, a bullet shattered a window in his Yuma, Arizona, office, KVOA reported. ""I do feel a great deal of concern for the people that work with me, for me. I feel concerned for the constituents that come to that office,"" Grijalva told KVOA Thursday. ""Obviously, we're going to have to make more changes.""

"CAMDEN, South Carolina (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN Wednesday he agrees with President Bush's veto of legislation expanding a children's health insurance program, saying the bill provided a ""phony smoke and mirrors way of paying for it."" Sen. John McCain says the president was right to veto the expansion of a children's health insurance program. ""Right call by the president,"" the Republican White House hopeful told CNN's John King. ""We've laid a debt on these same children ... that we're saying we're going to give health insurance to."" The bill, which would cost $35 billion over five years, is meant to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program to provide coverage to an additional 10 million children. Bush said he vetoed the bill because he considered it a step towards ""federalizing"" medicine and an inappropriately expanding the program's goal beyond its original focus on helping poor children. During an interview onboard the CNN Election Express in South Carolina, McCain said he agreed with the president's decision.  Watch Sen. McCain's interview with CNN's John King » . ""The American people have rebelled against out-of-control spending. If they can find a legitimate way to pay for it, I would consider it,"" he said. Expanding the program to cover children in families up to 400 percent of the poverty line would an ""unfunded liability,"" the Arizona Republican said. ""Just like the Medicare prescription drug program."" In the wide ranging interview, McCain also answered questions about the health of his campaign, saying he currently feels like he is in a good position. ""I am feeling good, not only because of my gut instinct, but because people don't really focus on the nominees until after Labor Day and I understand that,"" he said.  ""Our turnouts at the town halls are excellent; particularly in New Hampshire and here in South Carolina. I can sense that enthusiasm."" But McCain also acknowledged he would have to win some important states early in the primary process to have a chance at his party's nomination. ""I think history shows since 1980, the nominee of our party has to win two of the first three:  Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina."" McCain also continued to clarify his recent controversial interview with a religious Web site  in which he called America a ""Christian nation"" and said he would prefer a Christian president. In the interview Wednesday, McCain broadened his language a bit, emphasizing the Judeo-Christian roots of the nation. ""My views are ... this nation was founded by our founders who were informed by Judeo-Christian values,"" he told CNN.  ""I believe that, and I think it's evident by reading Federalist papers, the Declaration of Independence, and our Constitution. That's what I believe. And I believe that those Judeo-Christian values inform our lives today - and certainly mine."" ""And yes, I believe a Muslim could be president,"" he continued.

"(CNN)A river of blood runs through Gaza, as homes are smashed to rubble and hospital emergency rooms overflow. The volley of Hamas rockets into Israel continues, even when met with the preeminent firepower of the Israeli military's  bombs, missiles and shells. The legions of dead are swelling by the hundreds. It's horrifying. But the world has seen it all before -- twice. Operation Protective Edge looks much like its forerunners in 2008 and 2012. Hamas won't back down. And Israel refuses to stop until it feels the job is done. Millions around the world watch and ask: What could Israel hope to achieve? CNN put that question and others to two seasoned Israeli columnists: one a former military correspondent, the other a human rights journalist focusing on Palestinians. Though they disagreed on many points, they surprisingly concurred on some others. This is how they answered: . 1. What is Israel's endgame in this operation? There is none. Both experts agree on that. But though Israel may not be working toward one dramatic outcome, there are concrete objectives, says military writer Ron Ben-Yishai. There are short-term and long-term goals that are worth it for Israel, he argues. Many of them will work, concedes critical columnist Gideon Levy. But he disagrees about their wisdom. They won't cure the disease but instead feed it, he argues. It will turn the violence into a recurring nightmare. 2. What is the immediate military objective? The conservative government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to stop the Hamas rocket fire. The mission will also weaken Hamas, Ben-Yishai says. ""Erode the political clout and the ability of Hamas to act both as a political and military-terrorist movement,"" those are the objectives, he says. In the meantime that mission has expanded to destroying underground tunnels, which Hamas militants use to get into Israel and attack. Ben-Yishai is confident the goals can be achieved. ""For the short-run, no doubt,"" Levy concurs. But he thinks Hamas will come back stronger after Protective Edge, both militarily and politically. He cites Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012 and Operation Cast Lead in 2008. In Cast Lead, 1,300 Palestinians and more than a dozen Israelis died. Afterward, Hamas made a full recovery, he said. 3. What sparked this round of conflict? Levy sees the rocket fire from Gaza as the boiling over of cumulative tensions. He points to the peace process initiated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry between Israel and Palestinians. The one that broke down weeks ago. The whole time, someone was missing from the negotiating table, he said. ""Gaza was ignored totally."" Youth killings, of three Israeli teens and then one Palestinian teen, ignited passions on both sides. Add to that the desperation in Gaza. The narrow strip of land is locked in on all sides, and people there live in dire poverty and deprivation. ""Gaza is today the biggest cage in the world,"" Levy says. The rocket fire is just a part of it all, he says. It's a way of Hamas pounding the table. Ben-Yishai sees it the other way around. Israel has tried peace and calm with the troublesome Hamas militants, and it hasn't worked out. ""This formula is out of the game. It's not in the cards now,"" he says. The military option has become inevitable. 4. What makes Protective Edge different? Ben-Yishai agrees with Levy's assessment that Hamas militants have come back stronger since the last military operation -- in at least one sense. They have more long-range rockets. Previously, militants had to import them all from the outside. Now they can also construct them themselves, he says. They've also buried a network of launch sites below the ground's surface. Hitting them ""is quite a job,"" Ben-Yishai says. The Israeli military will have to strike deep into those systems. Levy says the  improvement in weaponry is part of the vicious cycle he's seen before. The Israeli military destroys the militants' capabilities; they come back stronger. ""By the next operation, they will be even better equipped,"" he says. So will the Israelis. Hamas has also inflicted more casualties on Israel this time around -- 29 soldiers have died in the Gaza ground incursion, whereas just over a dozen died in Cast Lead. If too many Israelis die, it could have an effect on Israeli public opinion and perhaps turn things around, Levy says. But so far, the public is showing much support for the operation in Gaza. 5. What will be the lasting effects of the operation? The government hopes that Protective Edge will give Israel a few years of relative peace and restore normalcy for a time, Ben-Yishai says. ""After every round of hostility ... there is a sort of lull that Israel enjoys very much,"" he says. People can think about other things and tackle other issues, like the economy. But it's not nearly worth the cost, Levy says. Droves of Palestinians will be killed, others' lives ruined. Even from a purely selfish standpoint, it's at best an empty victory. ""We will see horrible scenes,"" he says. ""The world will condemn Israel. And what comes out of it? One year of peace."" Ben-Yishai believes there is a permanent gain to be made, that repeated operations in Gaza will wear the enemy down until they stop firing rockets altogether. The result will be the opposite, Levy says. He predicts that this military intervention will set the stage for the next bloodcurdling intervention -- and then the next. What is Hamas' endgame in Gaza? New wave of Israeli airstrikes hammers Gaza . Flare-up in Israeli-Palestinian violence: Why now? Has the Middle East crisis reached a tipping point?","Military operations in Gaza make sense for Israel, an analyst says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A ""lost"" Beatles track recorded in 1967 and performed just once in public could finally be released, according to Paul McCartney. Beatles Paul McCartney, left, and Ringo Starr, right, with Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. ""Carnival of Light"" -- a 14-minute experimental track recorded at the height of the Beatles' musical experimentations with psychedelia and inspired by avant-garde composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen -- has long been considered too adventurous for mainstream audiences. In an interview for BBC radio, McCartney said his bandmates and their producer George Martin had vetoed its inclusion on the exhaustive 1990s ""Anthology"" collection, according to UK's The Observer newspaper. McCartney confirmed he still owned the master tapes, adding that he suspected ""the time has come for it to get its moment,"" The Observer reported. ""I like it because it's the Beatles free, going off piste,"" McCartney said. Almost everything recorded by the Beatles from their early days in Liverpool and Hamburg to their break-up in 1970 has been released to meet insatiable public appetite for anything to do with the legendary Liverpool quartet. In the 40 years since its recording, ""Carnival of Light"" has acquired near mythical status among Beatles fans who argue that the existence of the track provides evidence of the group's experimental ambitions beyond their commercially successfully pop career. The improvised work features distorted electric guitars, discordant sound effects, a church organ and gargling interspersed with McCartney and John Lennon shouting random phrases like ""Barcelona"" and ""Are you all right?"" McCartney would need the consent of Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, and George Harrison's widow, Olivia Harrison, to release the track.","Paul McCartney ponders releasing ""lost"" Beatles track, ""Carnival of Light""

"The FBI issued a warning Sunday to members of the U.S. military that ISIS is calling for attacks against them, according to a law enforcement source, saying that ""overseas based individuals are looking for like-minded individuals in the U.S. to carry out these attacks."" ""We also request members of the military review their online social media presence for any information that might attract the attention of violent extremists,"" the bulletin said, advising that members of the military ""use caution and practice operational security when posting."" The new FBI bulletin includes a concern that ISIS members are ""spotting and assessing"" individuals in the U.S. who they believe may be interested in carrying out attacks on U.S. soil against members of the U.S. military, a U.S. counter-terror official tells CNN. The bulletin language warns of ""individuals overseas spotting and assessing"" individuals in the U.S., based on their social media postings in support of the group. The warning encourages members of the military to ""exercise operational security"" in response to such threats, including reviewing their online social media postings so as not to make themselves easier targets. U.S. law enforcement posted the warning now in advance of the upcoming holiday season when many members of the U.S. military travel in uniform. The new warning also cites several recent attacks in Canada against members of the Canadian military, including the Oct. 22 Ottawa shooting and two other attacks using cars. The concern in the FBI and intelligence community is that ISIS members overseas are tracking personal information about ""specific"" U.S. soldiers --- such as their addresses and even their relatives addresses -- based on their social media posts, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the matter. The concern is that ISIS operatives are gathering it overseas and then identifying homegrown violent extremists in the U.S who could help carry out the attack. The source says the idea is basically "" I don't have to come and get him -- I can call someone in the U.S. who wants to support the cause and they can do it."" The FBI is working very closely with the military and intelligence community to address the issue. A Pentagon spokesman said Monday morning that the bulletin ""reinforces the guidance our combat commanders put out several weeks ago. This is nothing new for us."" Col. Steve Warren, the Pentagon spokesman, said he was ""aware of no new intelligence"" that led to the bulletin being sent. The FBI also issued a security bulletin in October warning of similar attacks on U.S. soil against law enforcement personnel and members of the news media. Terrorism and security experts have expressed growing concerns in recent months that ISIS could inspire individuals in the West to carry out terrorist attacks.

"Suspected cop killer Eric Frein was slapped with terrorism-related charges Thursday in Pennsylvania for allegedly admitting that he shot two state troopers in a bid to change the government and ""wake people up,"" according to court documents. The 31-year-old survivalist and military buff was captured October 30 at an abandoned airport after leading a small army of law enforcement officers on a weekslong manhunt in eastern Pennsylvania. Frein was arraigned on charges including first-degree murder and making and possessing a weapon of mass destruction for pipe bombs found while he was on the run in connection with the September 12 ambush shooting that left Cpl. Bryon Dickson dead and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded. The manhunt lasted almost seven weeks, involved as many as 1,000 officers at times. Authorities said the search cost more than $11 million in salaries, travel, equipment, utilities and other expenses. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. On Thursday, Frein was charged with two terrorism counts for committing ""a violent offense intending top influence the policy of the government by intimidation or coercion"" and committing a violent offense ""intending to affect the conduct of government,"" according to court documents. After his arrest, Frein allegedly told investigators that he ""wanted to make a change (in government) and that voting was insufficient to do so, because there was no one worth voting for,"" according to an affidavit filed in Pike County in support of the new charges. Frein allegedly called the killing of Dickson an ""assassination,"" the court documents said. The suspect said the shootings were an attempt to bring about a change in government and to ""wake up people, because it was all he could do."" In addition, investigators recovered a letter from Frein to his parents  -- addressed ""Mom and Dad"" -- on a thumb drive in which he writes of revolution and complains that the United States ""is far from what it was and what it should be"" ""I have seen so many depressing changes made in my time that I cannot imagine what it must be like for you,"" Frein allegedly wrote in the letter. ""There is so much wrong and on so many levels only passing through the crucible of another revolution can get us back the liberties we once had. I do not pretend to know what that revolution will look like or even if it will be successful."" Frein's father, Michael, a retired U.S. Army major with 28 years of service, told investigators that he trained his son to shoot and that the younger Frein ""doesn't miss."" ""Tension is high at the moment and the time seems right for a spark to ignite a fire in the hearts of men,"" Frein wrote to his parents. ""What I have done has not been done before and it felt like it was worth a try."" He added, ""I do not have a death wish but I know the odds. I tried my best to do this thing without getting identified, but if you are reading this then I was not successful."" Asked about the new charges, Frein's lawyer, Michael Weinstein, said: ""These are just allegations right now, these are not substantiated yet. Let's take a look at this evidence. We'll take this one step at a time. These type of cases take a long time and require careful scrutiny."" Frein is charged in an ambush outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove. Frein melted into the thick Pennsylvania woods after the shootings, authorities said. After his arrest, authorities found a laptop, first aid supplies, shave kits, DVDs, contact lenses and even a copy of the New Testament belonging to Frein, according to police documents. The suspect told authorities he used a Lenovo Thinkpad laptop while on the run to access open wireless connections and use the Internet, according to court documents. Frein's trove of survival supplies indicated that he was well-equipped to survive alone in the wilderness for weeks or even months. In addition to various articles of clothing and multiple weapons and ammunition, Frein had packed food items such as cup noodles, rice, beans, five-gallon water jugs, crackers, soy sauce, vegetable oil, and even a bottle of soju, a Korean vodka. When he was captured, Frein did not put up a fight. He was shackled in the Dickson's handcuffs, put in the backseat of the slain trooper's squad car and driven to the barracks where the ambush on Dickson occurred.","Frein claimed he shot two state troopers in bid to change government, documents say .

"A team of Mexican architects have designed a 65-story glass and steel pyramid to sit in the middle of Mexico City's most historic plaza. But, if it ever gets built, you won't see it anywhere on the skyline. That's because it would be the world's first ever ""earthscraper"" -- a 300-meter deep office and living space with ambitions to turn the modern high-rise, quite literally, on its head. ""There is very little room for any more buildings in Mexico City, and the law says we cannot go above eight stories, so the only way is down"" explains Esteban Suarez, co-founder of BNKR Arquitectura, the firm behind the proposals. ""This would be a practical way of conserving the built environment while creating much-needed new space for commerce and living,"" he added. But would it really be that practical? The design, which would cost an estimated $800 million to build, is the shape of an inverted pyramid with a central void to allow for some much-needed natural light and ventilation. Suarez says the first 10 stories would hold a museum dedicated to the city's history and its artifacts. ""We'd almost certainly find plenty of interesting relics during the dig -- dating right back to the Aztecs who built their own pyramids here,"" he says. The following 10 floors are assigned to retail and housing, with the remaining 35 intended for commercial office space, says Suarez. Suarez concedes that getting natural light and fresh air down to the lower floors will be a problem and he is investigating a ""system of fiber optics"" that could deliver sunlight from the surface. The design also includes a series of a series of ""earth lobbies"" that would store plants and trees with the intention of improving air-quality and, no doubt, the gloomy subterranean landscape. Suarez says renewable energy could be generated by a turbine powered from collected groundwater. Enough to keep the lights on in an underground office block 24 hours a day? ""I couldn't say at this stage"" replies Suarez. But although it has the hallmarks of a fossil-fuel guzzling Goliath -- and a name to match -- Suarez says the ""Earthscraper"" has great eco-credentials.  ""In many ways, this project is all about the environment -- not just in how we preserve our historic skyline, but how we prevent the serious problem of urban sprawl into the countryside,"" he says. According to the 32-year-old architect, Mexico City's main square -- commonly known as the ""Zocalo"" -- is one of the biggest city plazas in the world. ""It's a massive empty plot, which makes it the ideal site for our program,"" he said. To conserve the numerous activities that take place on the 190,000 square-foot plaza throughout the year -- including concerts, protests, open-air exhibitions and military parades -- the void will be covered with a glass floor that Suarez believes will allow the life of the ""Earthscraper"" to blend with everything happening on top. At present, Suarez and his team are in the process of presenting their idea to the local authorities. So, if you were in their shoes, what would you say? Is the ""Earthscraper"" a genuinely feasible innovation or a pretty but impractical pipe dream? Tell us you thoughts in the comments section below.","Mexican architects believe they have solution to capital's overcrowding .

"Have you heard that it all comes down to turnout? Of course you have, because politicians  say it every November. But the act of getting voters to the polls is much more than a shopworn cliche. There's an entire industry in American politics built around finding and mobilizing voters, largely constructed by Democrats who have been innovating in the field for more than a decade. The nerd science of campaigning -- sifting through data, analyzing behavior, modeling segments of voters and persuading people to cast ballots -- is one reason President Barack Obama's team flabbergasted Mitt Romney's overconfident numbers-crunchers in 2012. Many of those same Democratic operatives are on the front lines of the 2014 midterm elections, mining the electorate, state-by-state, to find enough voters to tip a race one or two points in their direction. Having a well-oiled field operation is never enough to overcome a bad national climate or a bum candidate at the top of the ticket. But in a tight campaign like so many of the deadlocked 2014 races it can make a serious difference. DSCC back on the air in Kentucky . With advanced analytics and targeting, the Obama team in 2012 narrow-casted its message to persuadable voters -- on Facebook, on television, on Pandora, on well-placed billboards, on doorsteps, wherever -- and tilted swing state electorates in their favor. It was done efficiently, without wasting money on television ads or mailers that were hitting the wrong households. In press reports after the campaign, Obama's tech savants were hailed as ""gurus"" and ""masterminds."" They weren't always so celebrated. ""On the Kerry campaign in 2004, they put the internet team -- they called us the Internet team, not digital -- next to the IT team, and most people would come over and ask us to fix their printers,"" says Andrew Bleeker, the founder of Bully Pulpit Interactive, one the Democratic Party's premier digital firms. ""That was how little people understood,"" he says. ""It wasn't until we started to produce metrics that people understood that people took us seriously. So raising money was the first big one. We raised $87 million in 2004. And then people said, all right. Digital. Got it."" Bleeker was a grunt on the Kerry campaign. But like many of his young colleagues, he was a pioneer. Bleeker, now 29, went on to steer digital marketing for both of Obama's innovative campaigns, launching Bully Pulpit along the way to build full-spectrum digital campaigns for Democrats. Hillary Clinton is returning to Iowa . Along with Obama, they've helped elect Elizabeth Warren in 2012 as well as New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2013. This cycle, Bully Pulpit is doing independent expenditure work for Democratic party committees as well as NextGen Climate, the Tom Steyer-funded environmental outfit. In a fragmented and self-segregating media world, defined by declining television viewership and skyrocketing mobile usage, the digital geeks of 2004 are now at the chief innovators of voter targeting. ""In 2004, there were like 30 of us in a horrible dive bar,"" said Ben Coffey Clark, a veteran of Howard Dean's presidential campaign and a partner a Bully Pulpit. ""We started off in the back of the campaign, with no access, no insight and no budget. Now we are at the forefront of how you reach voters and change sentiment online."" By matching voter files with consumer data and online behavior, Bully Pulpit creates models of voting universes and devises clever, eye-catching ways to engage with them in the digital space, where attention spans are notoriously short. The ""Stop Tweeting Boring Shit"" poster displayed prominently in its Farragut North offices is less a joke than a guiding principle. Their goals -- fundraising, persuasion, mobilization -- are as varied as the tools they employ. They produce online video, display ads, micro-sites, Facebook and Twitter campaigns and email blasts for their candidates. ""We know how to reach people that are low TV watchers,"" says Mark Skidmore, a Bully Pulpit partner with a background in corporate marketing and communications. ""We know from our modeling that 33%, as high as 40%, of voters might not be watching any television. So if you are spending the majority of budget on television, guess what? You are probably not getting any of that 40%."" With election day less than two weeks away, their offices resemble a day-trading firm, with scores of smartly-dressed young operatives glued to their computers and pushing out content aimed at mobilizing voters. ""Right now, we are optimizing our campaigns,"" Clark says. ""The strategy has been set. We know the story of the candidates. We have really good content and video and sites to direct people towards."" ""Digital,"" ""data,"" ""field,"" ""micro-targeting"" -- the terms are often confused or lumped together as catchall shorthand for whatever it was the Obama campaign did on its Chicago computers to mobilize auto workers in Youngstown or Puerto Ricans in Orlando. The truth is that they are each discrete domains, each requiring its own expertise and methods. Democrats, the successful ones at least, have won by synchronizing those activities both inside their campaign offices and across the spectrum of left-leaning interest groups, ensuring that the right voters are getting the right message at exactly the right time and place. Another truth: Democrats are still better at most of it than Republicans. ""Republicans are still very much in the television persuasion model,"" said Zac Moffat, who led digital strategy for Romney's campaign and runs Target Victory, a leading GOP digital firm. ""We are still having philosophical arguments about where we are, and meanwhile the Democrats arguing about the type of targeting to use."" After getting walloped in the field in 2012, the GOP vowed to overhaul their digital and data efforts. In many ways, they have. The Republican National Committee, for instance, added a team of data scientists, juiced its email marketing and fundraising efforts (remember those George H.W. Bush socks?), and created a widely-used app for door-to-door canvassers. Today, 70% of RNC voter data being collected in the field is done digitally â€” up from just 5% last cycle. Outside groups like American Crossroads and Americans for Prosperity have also revamped their data and digital programs, tapping into the RNC's voter file, Data Trust, and i360, another data hub affiliated with the Koch brothers financial network. Opinion: Why the 'Seinfeld election' matters . But while Republicans have developed the tools and can point to a bevy of talented digital strategists in their ranks, they still haven't matched the culture or the manpower of the Democratic tech world that's been blossoming for over a decade. There are schools and training programs in Democratic circles focused on field organizing and data; Bleeker himself teaches one at Georgetown University. And there's a tradition of sharing information and best practices that's been well-established over the years, spearheaded by left-leaning interest groups and labor unions that began experimenting with voter contact techniques during the George W. Bush years. Moffat is confident Republicans will catch up. It will take time, he says, for the party's established consultant class, schooled in TV-buying, to understand the importance of data and digital advertising. ""It's not that Republicans aren't building tools,"" he says. ""The tools are there, it's just a question of why aren't people choosing to use them.""","There's an entire industry to find and mobilize voters .

"They stare wide-eyed from the pages of magazines, childlike in stature but engaged in extremely explicit sexual activities. They may be drawings, but critics say the images found on the pages of some of Japan's erotic manga are so disturbing they should be banned. ""I believe that this kind of terrible material is not protected under freedom of expression,"" says Masatada Tsuchiya, a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. On Wednesday, Japanese lawmakers passed a law that will see people caught with child porn jailed for a year or fined up to $10,000. However, it doesn't include possession of anime or manga depicting child abuse, no matter how sexually explicit. How explicit are they? To see what's being openly sold on Japanese shelves, CNN took a hidden camera to one of the many manga stores in the Akihabara district of Tokyo. The district is a known hub for ""otakus,"" obsessive members of anime and manga fandom, a worldwide group of avid followers of the genre. Down a set of stairs, there are rows and rows of manga, many containing popular themes and images. But five feet away, in an area marked ""adults only,"" the content took a sharp turn into shocking sex scenes, apparently involving minors. Some of the predominantly female characters wore school uniforms, hair clips and innocent expressions as they engaged in sometimes violent sex acts with dominant characters. Should it be banned? Mio Bryce, an expert on anime and manga from Macquarie University in Sydney, said Japan's obsession with ""kawaii"" or cuteness made it difficult to distinguish whether the characters in the material were depicting children or not. ""Cuteness means a generally more infantile character. Maybe the character is 20 years old, but maybe from your point of view, the character's 15 years old. It's very difficult,"" she said. Ken Akamatsu, who lobbies lawmakers on behalf of the Japan Cartoonists Association, said a total ban on explicit content would damage the entire industry, making creators too scared to put pen to paper in case they risked breaking the rules. He said the characters were imaginary, so unlike real child porn, no one was hurt. ""Actual children suffering and crying is not acceptable. But manga doesn't involve actual children. So there are no actual victims,"" he said. Child welfare advocates disagree. Shihoko Fujiwara runs Lighthouse, a nonprofit for exploited children. She told CNN she once worked on a case where a predator used a cartoon to convince a child that sex abuse was normal. ""So the pedophiles might bring the animation and say 'this is how you practice with adults,'"" she said. Child abuse in Japan . While no link has been made between anime, manga and child abuse, Japan is facing a  ""serious"" child abuse problem, according to a White Paper issued by e National Police Agency in March. The paper said the number of child abuse victims jumped 20% between 2011 and 2012, and the number of victims, arrests and cases are at their highest levels since they started compiling statistics in 1999. At the same time, the number of cleared child pornography crime cases rose to 1,596, the highest ever recorded, the paper said. Most -- 85% -- were Internet-related. The figures inspired the U.S. State Department to label Japan as an ""international hub"" for producing and trafficking child pornography. The U.S. report noted that no national law addresses the ""unfettered availability of sexual explicit cartoons, comics and video games, some of which depicted scenes of violent sexual abuse and the rape of children."" It added: 'While the NPA continued to maintain that no link was established between these animated images and child victimization, other experts suggested children are harmed by a culture that appears to accept child sexual abuse."" What is manga? The term manga means ""casual drawing."" The earliest examples date back to the 7th century, but it became very popular in the post-war period, Macquarie's Bryce said. That coincided that with the work of the so-called ""God of manga"" Tezuka Osamu, the creator of ""Astro Boy,"" one of the more popular Japanese characters that made the leap into Western media. Now the industry is worth an estimated $3.6 billion in comic book and magazine sales, according to the Publishing Science Institute figures from 2013. Animation takes in another extra $2.3 billion, according to the Media Development Research Institute. As Bryce points out, only a very small proportion of the market peddles sexually explicit material involving children. ""Very often people think manga equals sexual or manga equals violence. But it's only a part of manga... there are some very poetic, very beautiful ones,"" she said. 'Cuteness is a problem' The bigger problem, she said, is that manga permeates Japanese culture. It can be seen everywhere, from street signs to government pamphlets. Often, the characters depicted are young, vulnerable girls who meet consumers' desires for something ""kawaii"" or ""cute."" ""'Cuteness is a problem,"" she said. ""Because cuteness is something that makes you feel you have to protect the person, and there's a very fine line between 'I can protect the person' and 'I can control the person.'"" She said the prevalent depiction of young girls, especially in ""Lolita complex"" material, risks giving ""the wrong impression of women."" ""If you're looking at it all the time, how are you actually seeing people? Is it just a fantasy, or maybe some people with a bit of a wrong mind think that is actually there, and that is the way to treat women. So there is a risk,"" she said.","Japan bans possession of child pornography but not explicit animation .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- A little over a decade ago there were about 100,000 phone lines in Nigeria, mostly landlines run by the state-owned telecoms behemoth, NITEL. Today NITEL is dead, and Nigeria has close to 100 million mobile phone lines, making it Africa's largest telecoms market, according to statistics by the Nigerian Communications Commission. Across the rest of the continent the trends are similar: between 2000 and 2010, Kenyan mobile phone firm Safaricom saw its subscriber base increase in excess of 500-fold. In 2010 alone the number of mobile phone users in Rwanda grew by 50%, figures from the country's regulatory agency show. During the early years of mobile in Africa, the Short Messaging Service (SMS) was at the heart of the revolution. Today the next frontier for mobile use in Africa is the internet. ""Mobile is fast becoming the PC of Africa,"" says Osibo Imhoitsike, market coordinator for Sub-Saharan Africa at Norwegian firm Opera, whose mobile browser is enjoying an impressive uptake on the continent. ""In fact there isn't really anything more personal than a mobile phone nowadays."" Last October, for the first time ever, the number of Nigerians accessing the internet via their mobiles surpassed the number of desktop internet users, figures from Statcounter show. The trend has continued since then. Most of those devices will be low-end Nokia phones, tens of millions of which have already been sold on the continent. The more expensive ""smartphones"" are however also increasing in popularity, as prices drop. Blackberry's market share has been rising in the developing world, bucking the trend in Europe and North America. Google, for its part, plans to sell 200 million of its Android phones in Africa and it is estimated that by 2016 there will be a billion mobile phones on the continent. In 2007, President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, said: ""In 10 short years, what was once an object of luxury and privilege, the mobile phone, has become a basic necessity in Africa."" Watch video from Kenya on how mobile has changed Africa . Below are seven ways that mobile phones have transformed the continent: . BANKING . M-PESA is a mobile money transfer service launched by Safaricom, Kenya's largest mobile operator and Vodafone, in 2007. Five years later M-PESA provides services to 15 million Kenyans (more than a third of the population) and serves as conduit for a fifth of the country's GDP. In Kenya, Sudan and Gabon half or more of adults used mobile money, according to a survey by the Gates Foundation and the World Bank. The runaway success of M-PESA in Kenya is inspiring similar initiatives across the continent, from South Africa to Nigeria to Tunisia, as governments struggle to extend banking services to large numbers of the population -- across sub-Saharan Africa only one in five adults own bank accounts. Many Africans now use mobile money to pay their bills and airtime, buy goods and make payments to individuals, remittances from relatives living abroad are also largely done via mobile banking. See more from special series on Our Mobile Society' ACTIVISM . One lesson from the 2011 uprisings across North Africa was that mobile phones, with the infinite opportunities they offer for connection and communication, are able to transform ordinary citizens disenchanted by their governments, into resistance fighters. Realizing this, the beleaguered Mubarak regime successfully put pressure on Egypt's mobile phone networks to pull the plugs, in a bid to slow down the tempo of opposition activity. And so on January 28, 2011 mobile phone networks in Egypt went dead. Three years earlier, in the aftermath of bloody elections in Kenya, citizens were able to report violent occurrences via text messages to a server (via the Ushaidi platform) that was viewable by the rest of the world as they happened. Across the continent mobile phones are also bringing unprecedented levels of openness and transparency to the electoral process, empowering citizens from Cairo to Khartoum to Dakar to Lagos. EDUCATION . Nokia capitalized on the growing popularity of social networking in South Africa to launch MoMath, a mathematics teaching tool that targets users of the instant messaging platform Mxit. Mxit is South Africa's most popular social media platform, with more than 10 million active users in the country, the company says. The potential for transforming the continent's dysfunctional educational system is immense, as mobile phones -- cheaper to own and easier to run than PCs -- gain ground as tools for delivering teaching content. It is hoped that mediating education through social networking will help reduce the significant numbers of school-age African children who are not receiving any formal education. ENTERTAINMENT . A 2009 survey found that ""entertainment and information"" were the most popular activities for which mobile phones are used in Nigeria, in particular for dialing into favorite radio shows, voting in reality shows, downloading and sharing songs, photos and videos, as well as tweeting. However companies are creating mobile-only platforms targeted for this market. Africa now teems with online platforms like Kulahappy (a popular online Kenyan ""entertainment channel"" developed for the mobile screen) and AfriNolly, which bills itself as ""African movies in your pocket."" Nigeria's mobile music industry (covering everything from mobile downloads to ringtone and caller-tune subscriptions) is now a multimillion-dollar industry. Interestingly, Lithuanian mobile social networking site, Eskimi, recently became the second most visited site in Nigeria, after Facebook, and is in the top 10 bracket in several other African countries. Half of the site's seven million-plus active users are Nigerian. DISASTER MANAGEMENT . Mobiles have been finding innovative uses in refugee camps, allowing displaced persons to reconnect with family and loved ones. An NGO, Refugees United, has teamed up with mobile phone companies to create a database for refugees to register their personal details. The information available on the database allows them to search for people they've lost contact with. South Africa's 2008 xenophobic attacks inspired the launch of SMS emergency reporting and relief systems. AGRICULTURE . Mobile phones have made a huge difference in the lives of farmers in a continent where the agriculture sector sis one of the largest employers. Most of these people will be ""smallholder farmers,"" without access to financing or technology. By serving as platforms for sharing weather information, market prices, and micro-insurance schemes, mobile phones are allowing Africa's farmers to make better decisions, translating into higher-earning potentials. Farmers are able to send a text message to find out crop prices in places thousands of kilometers away. As far back as 2003, Kenya's Agricultural Commodities Exchange partnered with mobile operator Safaricom to launch SokoniSMS64, a text-messaging platform to provide pricing information to farmers. M-Farm also offers a similar service, while the iCow is a mobile app billed as ""the world's first mobile phone cow calendar."" It's an SMS and voice service that allows dairy farmers to track their cows gestation, acting in effect as a veterinary midwife. Farmers are also given tips on breeding and nutrition. HEALTH . A simple text-messaging solution was all 28-year-old Ghanaian doctoral student, Bright Simons needed for his innovative plan to tackle counterfeit medicine in African countries. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 30% of drugs supplied in developing countries are fake. In 2009, nearly 100 Nigerian babies died after they were given teething medicine that contained a solvent usually found in antifreeze. Simons' pioneering idea was to put unique codes within scratch cards on medicine packaging that buyers can send via SMS to a designated number to find out if the drug is genuine or not. The system is now being used by several countries in Africa and rolled out to places such as Asia where there are similar problems with counterfeit drugs. In South Africa there's Impilo, a service that allows people to find healthcare providers anywhere in the country 24 hours a day, using their mobile phones. Mobile phones are going to play an increasingly important role in mediating the provision of better healthcare to the citizens of African countries. Phone companies are realizing that mobiles are highly effective -- and potentially lucrative -- for the dissemination of health and lifestyle tips, and reminders for doctors' appointments. In June 2011 a consortium known as the mHealth Alliance organized a Mobile Health Summit -- touted as Africa's first -- in Cape Town. The Alliance describes itself as a ""[champion of] the use of mobile technologies to improve health throughout the world.""

"Mexico freed U.S. Marine reservist Sgt. Andrew Paul Tahmooressi, who'd been held  in a prison there for seven months. Tahmooressi boarded a flight for Miami from San Diego. ""It is with an overwhelming and humbling feeling of relief that we confirm that Andrew was released today after spending 214 days in Mexican jail,"" relatives said in a statement Friday night. A court ordered that Tahmooressi, who'd been held on weapons charges, be freed, a Mexican federal government news release said. Tahmooressi was arrested March 31 at a Tijuana, Mexico, checkpoint after Mexican customs agents found three firearms in his truck, including a .45-caliber pistol, a pump shotgun and an AR-15 rifle. Mexico's strict federal gun laws prohibit anyone from illegally bringing weapons into the country. Tahmooressi family spokesman Jonathan Franks said Friday night in a statement: ""The family is overjoyed. They are asking for privacy at this time."" The court said it found no cause to prosecute Tahmooressi on charges of carrying two firearms used exclusively by the military, possessing cartridges used exclusively by the military and carrying a firearm without a license . The court also recommended he be treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. His mother, Jill, told CNN in May that Tahmooressi, who served with the Marines in Afghanistan, had moved to the San Ysidro, California, area to get treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. ""He has unresolved, or untreated PTSD, and he cannot get the cognitive therapy behavior that veterans of America receive ... in a Mexico jail, where there is no such thing,"" his mother told CNN earlier this year. Since his arrest, Tahmooressi has maintained that he took a wrong turn on the California side of the border into Tijuana and accidentally crossed the border. In an interview with CNN, Tahmooressi described a suicide attempt with a shattered light bulb after being punched, slapped, cursed at, deprived of water and food, and shackled to a bed with a four-point restraint in a Mexican prison. ""I had one hand above my head, not both, just one,"" he told CNN. ""I was laying on a bed. ... When I got the opportunity, I decided to stab myself in the neck with a light bulb ... I was paranoid. I had been abused. I was thinking they were going to come and abuse me more and torture me and get information about my family from me. So I said, 'I'm not going to allow them to do that.' "" Tahmooressi said conditions improved after media coverage of his plight. Mexican prison authorities have denied the abuse allegations. The Richardson Center for Global Engagement said in a Facebook posting that Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico,  visited Tahmooressi last week at El Hongo federal prison in Mexico and was instrumental in securing his release. U.S. Reps. Ed Royce (R-California) and  Matt Salmon (R-Arizona) issued statements thanking Mexican authorities for showing compassion. ""[Tahmooressi] is a hero who served his country bravely on the battlefields of Afghanistan, which is why so many Americans have been focused on getting him home,"" said Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.","Andrew Paul Tahmooressi boards a flight for Miami from San Diego .

Lawrence admitted that she was initially mortified that her private pictures had made it onto the Internet but noted that being a celebrity doesn't mean that every detail of her life should be public. ""Just because I'm a public figure, just because I'm an actress, does not mean that I asked for this,"" she said. ""It does not mean that it comes with the territory.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama on Tuesday vowed to invest the resources needed to address the threat posed by drug traffickers in Mexico. A police convoy moves in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, last month, across the U.S. border from El Paso, Texas. ""We are going to continue to monitor the situation, and if the steps we have taken do not get the job done, then we will do more,"" he told reporters Tuesday night. He praised the efforts of Mexican President Felipe Calderon to counter drug cartels, which ""have gotten completely out of hand,"" but said the United States must take further steps, such as ensuring that illegal guns and cash do not flow from north of the Rio Grande to the cartels in Mexico. ""That's what makes them so dangerous,"" he said. Obama's remarks came hours after Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced that the United States is sending hundreds of federal agents and crime-fighting equipment to the border. The renewed push for stronger law-enforcement presence along the border comes as the administration tries to help the Mexican government break up drug cartels blamed for killing some 6,500 people in Mexico last year, Napolitano said. ""Our role is to assist in this battle because we have our own security interests in its success,"" Napolitano said at the White House. In an interview with CNN later Tuesday, she said, ""It's all about border safety and security and making sure that spillover violence does not erupt in our own country."" The new federal plan, developed by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security, calls for doubling the number of border security task force teams and moving a significant number of other federal agents, equipment and resources to the border. It also involves greater intelligence sharing aimed at cracking down on the flow of money and weapons into Mexico that helps fuel the drug trade, senior administration officials said. The plan commits $700 million to bolster Mexican law enforcement and crime prevention efforts. The funds will provide, among other things, five new helicopters to increase mobility for the Mexican army and air force as well as new surveillance aircraft for the Mexican navy. The funds also will support enhanced communications technology for Mexican prosecutors, law enforcement and immigration officials. The $700 million allocation, meant to assist what administration officials described as an ""anti-smuggling effort,"" will complement ongoing U.S. aid to Mexico under the Merida initiative: a three-year, $1.4 billion package aimed at helping Mexico fight the drug cartels with law enforcement training, military equipment and improved intelligence cooperation. The money was allocated last year, but Tuesday's announcement brought the first details of how some of that money will be spent. On the U.S. side of the border, more funding will support ""prosecutor-led, intelligence-based task forces"" that bring together the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies to dismantle drug cartels through investigation and extradition and the seizure and forfeiture of assets, Deputy Attorney General David Ogden said. ""As we've found with other large criminal groups, if you take their money and lock up their leaders, you can loosen their grip on the vast organizations that are used to carry out their criminal activities."" To help strengthen the U.S. side of the border further, the administration also plans to triple the number of Department of Homeland Security intelligence analysts dedicated to stopping Mexican-related violence. It also will increase the number of immigration officials working in Mexico, double the number of ""violent criminal alien"" teams on the border, strengthen the presence of border canine units and quadruple the number of border liaison officers working with Mexican law enforcement. It also will make an additional $59 million in federal funds available to support state, local and tribal border law enforcement operations. At the same time, more agents from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives will be deployed to the border region. The agents will be given updated equipment and surveillance technology to help track the movement of cash, drugs and weapons. At a congressional hearing in Washington on Tuesday, Phoenix, Arizona, Mayor Phil Gordon called the administration's initiative ""a great first step,"" but added, ""it's a drop in the bucket in terms of what is needed."" Phoenix finds itself at the center of a ""perfect storm"" of drug runners and human smugglers, he said. While most traditional crimes are down, crimes such as drug-related kidnappings and torturing are overwhelming Gordon's police department. ""Most nights we have over 60 Phoenix police officers (and) some federal agents rushing to rescue those on a reactive basis,"" Gordon said. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has also sought additional help for his state. Last month, Perry said he asked Napolitano for aviation assistance and ""1,000 more troops that we can commit to different parts of the border."" Perry said it didn't matter to him what kind of troops came. ""As long as they are boots on the ground that are properly trained to deal with the border region, I don't care whether they are military troops, or National Guard troops or whether they are customs agents."" Last week, a Perry spokeswoman said that federal border protection had been underfunded for some time and that the 1,000 extra troops Perry requested would fill in gaps that state and local agencies have been covering. The announcement comes shortly ahead of planned trips by three Cabinet secretaries to Mexico before Obama visits there next month. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton goes to Mexico City this week, to be followed next week by Napolitano and Attorney General Eric Holder.  Watch as the plan is unveiled ahead of Clinton's visit to Mexico » . Napolitano and Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg both emphasized the cooperation and ""courage"" of Calderon during the news conference announcing the policy changes. Calderon has been pushing back against U.S. criticism of drug cartel-related violence lately, arguing that the U.S. needs to take more responsibility for the outbreaks. In his speeches and other public remarks, Calderon repeatedly has pointed out that much of the demand for drugs and most of the weapons used by narco-traffickers comes from the United States. A prominent Washington-based gun control advocacy group released a report Tuesday backing Calderon's assertions regarding weapons trafficking. The report from the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence asserts that Mexican drug gangs have exploited weak American gun laws and corrupt gun dealers ""to amass arsenals of high-powered guns that have killed thousands and pose an increasingly grave security threat to Mexico and the U.S.,"" according to a statement from the organization. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama says plan seeks to halt weapons from entering Mexico from U.S.

"The International Court of Justice ruled Monday that Japan can no longer continue its annual whale hunt, rejecting the country's argument that it was for scientific purposes. ""Japan shall revoke any extant authorization, permit or license granted in relation to JARPA II, and refrain from granting any further permits in pursuance of that program,"" the court said, referring to the research program. The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Japan's fleet carries out an annual whale hunt despite a worldwide moratorium, taking advantage of a loophole in the law that permits the killing of the mammals for scientific research. Whale meat is commonly available for consumption in Japan. Each year, environmental groups such as Sea Shepherd pursue the Japanese hunters in an attempt to disrupt the whaling. The resulting confrontations have led to collisions of ships and the detention of activists. The Australian government challenged the Japanese whaling program in the International Court of Justice, leading to Monday's ruling. PHOTOS: Waiting for the whales .

"Want to pick up a pack of cigarettes with your prescription refill? A major U.S. pharmacy chain is breaking that habit. CVS Caremark announced Wednesday it will stop selling cigarettes and other tobacco products at its CVS/pharmacy stores by October 1. The retailer said the move makes CVS/pharmacy the first chain of national pharmacies to take tobacco products off the shelves. ""Ending the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products at CVS/pharmacy is the right thing for us to do for our customers and our company to help people on their path to better health,"" Larry J. Merlo, president and CEO of CVS Caremark, said in a statement. ""Put simply, the sale of tobacco products is inconsistent with our purpose."" CVS Caremark is the largest pharmacy in the United States based on total prescription revenue, according to the company. It operates more than 7,600 CVS/pharmacy stores nationwide in addition to more than 800 MinuteClinics, which are medical clinics within the pharmacy locations. Health-oriented organizations and President Barack Obama praised the move. ""As one of the largest retailers and pharmacies in America, CVS Caremark sets a powerful example, and today's decision will help advance my administration's efforts to reduce tobacco-related deaths, cancer, and heart disease, as well as bring down health care costs -- ultimately saving lives and protecting untold numbers of families from pain and heartbreak for years to come,"" Obama said in a statement Wednesday. ""This is an important, bold public health decision by a major retail pharmacy to act on the long understood reality that blending providing health care and providing cigarettes just doesn't match,"" said Dr. Richard Wender, chief cancer control officer at the American Cancer Society. ""We need an all-hands-on-deck effort to take tobacco products out of the hands of America's young generation, and to help those who are addicted to quit,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement. ""Today's CVS Caremark announcement helps bring our country closer to achieving a tobacco-free generation. I hope others will follow their lead."" It remained unclear whether other pharmacies will follow CVS' lead. ""We have been evaluating this product category for some time to balance the choices our customers expect from us with their ongoing health needs,"" Walgreens spokesman Jim Graham said in a statement. ""We will continue to evaluate the choice of products our customers want, while also helping to educate them and providing smoking-cessation products and alternatives that help to reduce the demand for tobacco products."" Meanwhile, David Howard, spokesman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., said, ""We value the long-term relationship with CVS and respect their commercial decision. We will work with them as they transition out of the tobacco category in the coming months."" Stopping cigarette sales comes at a price. CVS Caremark estimates it will take an annual loss of $2 billion from tobacco shoppers -- $1.5 billion in tobacco sales and the rest from other products tobacco shoppers purchase while in the store. The company has enjoyed growing revenues in recent years, boosted by its pharmacy services business and prescription drug sales. CVS Caremark hasn't reported its year-end results yet, but it took in nearly $94 billion in revenues in the first nine months of 2013, up slightly from the same period in 2012, according to its most recent earnings report. In 2012, CVS Caremark reported $123.1 billion in revenues, a 15% jump from $107.1 billion the previous year. ""We commend CVS for putting public health ahead of their bottom line and recognizing the need for pharmacies to focus on supporting health and wellness instead of contributing to disease and death caused by tobacco use,"" the American Medical Association said. Asked Wednesday about the reaction of tobacco executives to the decision, CVS Caremark's Merlo said they were ""disappointed. At the same time, I think they understand the paradox that we face as an organization, and they understand the rationale for the decision."" On whether CVS would extend its ban to other products known to be unhealthy -- candy, potato chips or alcohol, for instance -- Merlo told reporters those items, in moderation, do not have the same adverse effects as the use of tobacco. We know it can kill us: Why people still smoke . Helping people quit . The company also announced Wednesday it plans to launch a national smoking-cessation program in the spring. The program will include information and treatment on smoking cessation at CVS/pharmacy and Minute Clinic locations in addition to online resources. Members of the pharmacy benefit management plan will be able to access comprehensive programs to help themselves stop smoking. Smoking-cessation products such as nicotine patches or gum will continue to be available at CVS/pharmacy locations, Dr. Troyen Brennan, chief medical officer for CVS Caremark, said Wednesday. The last cigarette: Nine ex-smokers who quit the habit for good . Fewer people smoke today than in the mid-20th century, but there are still a lot of Americans lighting up. In 1965, 42% of the population smoked, compared with 19% today, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts said the decline in smoking has plateaued. It's no secret that tobacco causes health problems. Cancer, stroke, heart disease and lung diseases are among the results of smoking, according to the CDC. More than 5 million deaths per year are caused by tobacco use. Smokers also tend to die 10 years before nonsmokers, according to the CDC. Support from public health advocates . The company's announcement is ""a huge step toward our country being able to have a really long-lasting culture of health,"" said Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the largest U.S. philanthropy devoted to public health. In addition to eliminating a point of sale of tobacco, CVS Caremark's removal of tobacco products also takes away an advertising opportunity, said Robin Koval, president and CEO of Legacy, an organization that conducts research on tobacco use. Young people who shop at CVS/pharmacy for other reasons will no longer see the array of tobacco products available. ""It's obviously a landmark decision and one that I hope wakes up the entire retail industry that it's the right thing to do,"" Koval said. FDA launches teen anti-smoking campaign . A report from the California Department of Public Health found that while total cigarette sales decreased between 2005 and 2009 in the United States, sales in pharmacies increased. If sales of cigarettes at pharmacies continue rising at the current rate, by 2020 almost 15% of all U.S. cigarette sales will occur at pharmacies, the report said. According to a 2011 study in Los Angeles, cited in the report, more than 32% of pharmacies sold cigarettes, and traditional chain pharmacies were far more likely to sell cigarettes than independently owned pharmacies. Wender noted the CVS move is in line with what the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Medical Association, American Lung Association and American Pharmacists Association have advocated: to stop sales of tobacco in retail outlets with pharmacies. On the other side of the issue, there is a lot of money in tobacco. The cigarette industry spent $8.37 billion in 2011 on advertising and promotions, according to the CDC. Most tobacco is sold in convenience stores, which would be ""a tougher nut to crack"" in terms of stopping tobacco sales, Wender said. But pharmacies are a good place to start, Wender said. He is convinced the removal of tobacco products from CVS/pharmacy locations will result in some smokers quitting, particularly those who have a habit of buying their cigarettes there. ""It's going to force every one of them to pause and say, 'Why isn't my CVS selling cigarettes anymore?' "" Wender said.

"The open mike I-wish-I-hadn't-said-that moment when French President Nicolas Sarkozy called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a ""liar"" and Barack Obama didn't disagree is a tale as old as the hills for American presidents and secretaries of state. For decades, American presidents and diplomats have been locked in uneasy relationships with Israeli prime ministers from the Likud Party. One example: ""Who's the f---- superpower here,"" a frustrated Bill Clinton exploded to his aides after his first meeting with Netanyahu in 1996. It's a good thing for Obama that the open mike caught Sarkozy with the ad hominem attack on Netanyahu rather than the president. ""I can't stand him. He's a liar,"" Sarkozy said. Obama was heard to say, ""You're tired of him -- what about me? I have to deal with him every day,"" according to a French website. I'm sure many people would have loved to have heard more of what Obama thinks. There's no doubt that Obama is frustrated and angry in the extreme with what he perceives to be Netanyahu's recalcitrance  when it comes to Arab-Israeli peacemaking. Indeed if there was a cartoon bubble over the president's head,  I guarantee you his sentiments would have matched or even exceeded, Sarkozy's. When it comes to ""Bibi"" Netanyahu, our somewhat  detached and cool president is hot and very combustible. When Netanyahu was dismissively  lecturing the president during their press conference  last June in Washington, the look on Obama's face  was somewhere between mortification and raw anger. If looks could kill, we would have had a new Israeli Prime Minister by now. U.S.-Israeli relations on any number of issues are extremely close, even intimate; and the Iran nuclear challenge will almost certainly make them even closer. But the Arab-Israeli peace issue seems to bring out the worst in both sides, and it has for years now. Kissinger and Rabin went at it in 1975 over a second Sinai disengagement agreement (Kissinger recalled our Middle Eastern ambassadors as part of his so-called reassessment of the U.S.-Israeli relationship). President Jimmy Carter and Prime Minister Menachem Begin had a huge flap over settlements during the Camp David summit.  President George  H.W. Bush believed then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir misled him on settlements during their first meeting in 1989; and the relationship really never recovered. And Secretary of State James Baker wrestled with Shamir as well during the run-up to the Madrid peace  conference in 1991. So Barack Obama is only the latest in a line of frustrated American presidents and secretaries of state. They have had to deal with a close ally who can also be withholding and maddening when it comes to protecting Israel's political and security interests in a conflict in which they have much more to lose than the American mediator if things don't turn out right. But President Obama's Bibi problem is different in several respects from his predecessors -- a fact that all but guarantees that tensions with the Israelis on this issue are not going to subside anytime soon. The 2012 election has kept them in a box. Indeed, the president's speech at the U.N. General Assembly last month notwithstanding -- more a campaign speech than one that addressed the Israeli-Palestinian issue -- if Obama is re-elected, buckle your seat belts. It's going to be a wild ride with the Israelis. First, the others -- Kissinger, Carter, Bush 41, and Baker, unlike Obama (so far) -- all succeeded. Their fights with their Israeli counterparts were productive; indeed they all had a strategy -- and sufficient will and commitment on the part of Israelis and Arabs to do serious diplomacy. At the end of the day, despite the tensions, everybody went home a winner. Even Bill Clinton managed to hammer out two agreements with Netanyahu, though neither was completely implemented. Second, part of the reason these three succeeded was  that despite the toughness and the tension, there was a third ""T"" --   a modicum of trust that allowed each side to work with the other in something other than a  zero-sum game environment. They built a mutual stake in the other's success.  Former Secretary of State Baker will tell you that he had plenty of struggles with Shamir, but the two worked out a good personal relationship -- no leaks, respecting mutual red lines and so on. President Obama has yet to do that, and neither has Netanyahu.  On the Arab-Israel issue, the president believes Bibi is a con man, and Netanyahu thinks the president wants somebody else as prime minister.  The president is almost certainly persuaded that Netanyahu is buying time, playing American politics and hoping that the next president is a Republican who won't be so focused on pressing Israel on the peace process. If the administration could find a way to engineer regime change in Israel, it would. Indeed, the key folks that deal with the peace process at State and at the White House are veterans of dealing with Netanyahu (Hillary Clinton and  Dennis Ross). They have seen the movie before, and they had hoped not to be in the sequel. Finally, there's the president himself, who clearly believes he knows best how to run the peace process. Obama doesn't just have a Bibi problem, he's got an Israel problem. Obama is not anti-Israel, but unlike his two predecessors -- Bill Clinton and George W. Bush -- he's not in love with the idea of Israel. He falls somewhere north of Jimmy Carter on the pro-Israel spectrum and south of George H.W. Bush.  Here the president's coolness and  detachment works against him. His early tough rhetoric against settlements and his commitment to fix the peace process whether or not Israel agreed created a  pretty rocky foundation for gaining the trust and confidence so critical on the Israeli side, if a president wants them to do politically tough things later. Yes, Mr. President, Israelis can be frustrating. Just ask Kissinger, Carter and Baker. And this Israeli prime minister may simply not be willing or able to do the deal you want him to do.  But  if there's any chance of it,  you're going to have to find a better way to deal with him, figure out how  to stabilize the relationship and find a better balance  than pandering to Netanyahu on one hand or trying to punish him on the other. And in the meantime, stay away from any live mikes.","President Obama didn't object when Sarkozy called Israeli prime minister a ""liar""

"Health officials are reporting new cases of the chikungunya virus in Cuba and the United States. The debilitating virus has been spreading in the Caribbean through infected mosquitoes since December, according to the World Health Organization. On Thursday, the Georgia Department of Public Health confirmed the state's first case of chikungunya. Health officials say the patient was infected during a recent trip to a Caribbean nation. Recent cases have also been reported in North Carolina and Tennessee, with a total of 57 infections reported to the CDC this year, according to a CDC spokesperson. Six chikungunya infections have also been documented in Cuba, according to a local paper, which references the Cuban Ministry of Public Health. The paper says the patients were frequent travelers to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Close to 5,000 chikungunya cases have been confirmed in the Caribbean this year, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PDF); more than 160,000 cases are suspected. Locales with the virus include the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Experts say American tourists are bringing chikungunya back home, and it's just a matter of time before it starts to spread within the United States. New to the Americas, the virus, which causes fever and joint pain that can become chronic, has no cure or vaccine. Preventing mosquito bites is key to avoiding infection. Experts offer these basic tips: . • Use bug spray if you are going out, especially in tropical or wooded areas near water. • Get rid of standing water; empty plastic pools, flower pots and pet dishes so mosquitoes don't breed in them. • Dress appropriately in long sleeves and pants.

"The University of Connecticut players were hungry for another championship. Their impressive defense and their ability to hit clutch shots sated that appetite Monday night. The Huskies downed the freshmen-laden Kentucky Wildcats 60-54 to win the NCAA men's basketball championship. Shabazz Napier scored a game-high 22 points to lead the Huskies while Ryan Boatright added 14 points. James Young tallied 20 points for the Wildcats. The difference came at the free-throw line where Connecticut was 10-for-10 and Kentucky was just 13-for-24. ""We always did it together. It was won as a group,"" UConn Coach Kevin Ollie said. The Huskies never trailed in the game as Napier, the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four, hit key baskets any time the Wildcats got close. Kentucky drew to within one point on three occasions, the final time with 8:13 remaining in the game. But Napier, a senior who was on the 2011 UConn national championship team, drilled a three-pointer. ""Ladies and gentlemen, you are looking at the hungry Huskies,"" Napier said. ""We worked so hard for it."" Fans celebrating the victory uprooted a light post in front of the engineering building on the UConn campus and smashed it through a window, campus police said.  They also overturned chairs and tables in the student union, they said. Officers made 30 arrests, said college spokesman Tom Breen. Disappointment for Wildcats . It was a disappointing end for the Wildcats, who began the season with a No. 1 ranking and fans dreaming of a highly regarded freshman class leading the team to a perfect record. They struggled through the regular season, but began to play extremely well in the NCAA tournament. ""We had our chances to win ... and we hung in there. These kids never gave up,"" Kentucky Coach John Calipari said. ""We just didn't have enough."" The first half broke true to form for the typically slow-starting Wildcats and Kentucky trailed at intermission 35-31. That  was good news considering they were down by 15 -- Kentucky's largest deficit of the tournament -- with just six minutes left in the half. But the Wildcats switched to a zone defense and UConn went three minutes between Napier baskets. The zone also kept the Wildcats out of foul trouble -- they committed just three in the first 20 minutes. The Wildcats closed the half on a 16-5 run that included three Wildcats three-pointers. Earlier, it was the tough defense of the Huskies that troubled the Wildcat guards. At one point the Wildcats, who hadn't turned the ball over for the last 18 minutes of their semifinal win against Wisconsin, had as many turnovers (four) baskets against the frenetic Huskies. In the second half, the Huskies again opened up a nice margin -- nine points at 48-39. But the Wildcats clawed back as Young made a highlight-reel dunk and free throw to start a short-lived comeback. Kentucky missed three of four free throws down the stretch and couldn't hit any of its jump shots. First for the coach . The Huskies won their fourth national title, all of them achieved since 1999. It was the first championship for Ollie, who replaced longtime coach Jim Calhoun two years ago. Ollie became the second coach to win an NCAA championship in his initial tournament appearance. The two teams have combined to win seven titles in the past 19 seasons, but neither was even in the tournament a year ago. Kentucky had a group of freshmen that never meshed as a team and went to the National Invitation Tournament, and UConn was ineligible because it didn't meet NCAA graduation requirements. UConn will have a chance to match its unique accomplishment of both the men's and women's teams winning titles in the same year. The Huskies play the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in Tuesday night's women's title game.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama vowed Wednesday that Jerusalem must ""remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided."" ""Any agreement with the Palestinian people must preserve Israel's identity as a Jewish state, with secure, recognized and defensible borders,"" the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential pro-Israel lobbying group. ""Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided,"" Obama said. The Palestinians also want Jerusalem to be the capital of their own country. United States policy has long been intentionally vague on the status of Jerusalem. The U.S. Embassy in Israel is in Tel Aviv, not Jerusalem. Obama opened his speech to AIPAC by paying tribute to his rival, Sen. Hillary Clinton, calling her an extraordinary public servant who had made history alongside him in their 16-month race for the party's presidential nomination.  Watch more of Obama's AIPAC speech » . Obama clinched the nomination Tuesday night, but Clinton did not admit defeat in her speech after the polls closed. Obama called Iran the greatest threat in the Middle East, but reiterated his willingness to meet with the Islamic state's leaders under appropriate conditions. ""Contrary to the claims of some, I have no interest in sitting down with our adversaries just for the sake of talking. But as president of the United States, I would be willing to lead tough and principled diplomacy with the appropriate Iranian leader at a time and place of my choosing -- if, and only if it can advance the interests of the United States,"" Obama said. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly criticized Obama for saying he would be willing to meet with the leaders of hostile nations. Obama, for his part, blasted McCain's Iraq policy. ""Sen. McCain offers a false choice: Stay the course in Iraq, or cede the region to Iran. I reject this logic because there is a better way. Keeping all of our troops tied down indefinitely in Iraq is not the way to weaken Iran -- it is precisely what has strengthened it,"" Obama said. But the Democrat denied he would pull U.S. troops out of Iraq without taking into account conditions on the ground, as McCain has charged. ""I have proposed a responsible, phased redeployment of our troops from Iraq. We will get out as carefully as we were careless getting in. We will finally pressure Iraq's leaders to take meaningful responsibility for their own future,"" he said. Clinton spoke immediately after Obama at the conference and praised him, saying he would be a friend to Israel. Though Clinton has yet to concede the Democratic race and spoke Wednesday of what she would do as president, she told AIPAC that Obama ""understands what is at stake here."" ""It has been an honor to contest these primaries with him. It is an honor to call him my friend. And let me be very clear: I know that Sen. Obama will be a good friend to Israel,"" the New York senator and former first lady said.  Watch more of Clinton's speech » . Some Clinton supporters have begun to campaign for Obama to choose Clinton as his running mate, but the two campaigns deny that discussions on the subject have begun. Obama also directly addressed accusations that have been circulating by e-mail. ""I want to say that I know some provocative e-mails have been circulating throughout Jewish communities across the country,"" Obama said. ""They're filled with tall tales and dire warnings about a certain candidate for president. And all I want to say is -- let me know if you see this guy named Barack Obama, because he sounds pretty scary."" Rumors have been circulating at least since last year that Obama is a Muslim and does not support the Jewish state. He is a Christian and said at the conference he is a ""true friend of Israel,"" earning applause. In his AIPAC speech, Obama also clarified a story he told last month that prompted a barrage of criticism from Republicans. ""My great uncle had been a part of the 89th Infantry Division -- the first Americans to reach a Nazi concentration camp. They liberated Ohrdruf, part of Buchenwald, on an April day in 1945,"" Obama said. Last month, he said an uncle had helped liberate the Auschwitz concentration camp, which was in fact liberated by the Soviet army.","NEW: Sen.

"Groundbreaking research that reshaped the way economists and investors look at how markets work has earned three American professors the Nobel Prize in economics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Monday. Eugene F. Fama and Lars Peter Hansen of the University of Chicago and Robert J. Shiller of Yale University received the prize ""for their empirical analysis of asset prices,"" the Nobel committee said. According to the committee, the economists' research ""laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices."" Their research showed that while it is difficult to predict asset prices in the short term, prices can be predicted in broad terms over longer periods, such as three to five years, according to the academy. Their work resulted in the emergence of stock index funds -- collections of assets designed to mimic the results of broader stock indexes, such as the Dow Jones Industrial. Such funds are often staples of retirement and individual investment accounts. Shiller warned about the 1990s-era ""stock bubble"" and about high home prices before the decline in housing values that greatly contributed to the recession from which the U.S. economy continues to recover, CNN Money reported Monday. Reached by phone during the news conference announcing the award, Shiller said ""disbelief"" was the only way to describe his reaction. ""A lot of people have told me they hoped I would win it, but I am aware that there are so many other worthy people that I had discounted it,"" he said. He said economics has broad applications to improving human welfare. ""Finance drives modern civilization,"" Shiller said. ""I want to see finance developed further to benefit mankind."" The economics award was not among the original prizes created in 1895 by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel to honor work in physics, medicine, chemistry, literature and peace. The Central Bank of Sweden added it as a category in memory of the industrialist. The first prize was awarded in 1969. Most of the recipients of the Nobel in economics have been born in the United States. Nobel highlights Syria with Peace Prize to chemical weapons watchdog .

"The U.S. Embassy in Libya evacuated its personnel on Saturday because of heavy militia violence raging in the capital, Tripoli, the State Department said. About 150 personnel, including 80 U.S. Marines, were evacuated early Saturday and were driven across the border into Tunisia, U.S. officials confirm to CNN. U.S. officials stress operations have been ""temporarily suspended"" until ""the security situation on the ground improves."" The embassy will continue to operate from other locations. A senior State Department official said some of the staff will be sent to other U.S. embassies in the region and others will return to Washington. CNN has learned the decision to carry out the evacuation was made just in the last few days as the security situation around the embassy deteriorated. President Barack Obama approved the State Department recommendation to temporarily relocate personnel because of the ""ongoing violence resulting from clashes between Libyan militias in the immediate vicinity"" of the embassy, a White House official said. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the United States is grateful to Tunisia ""for its cooperation and support."" She said the personnel are ""traveling onward"" from Tunisia. ""We are committed to supporting the Libyan people during this challenging time, and are currently exploring options for a permanent return to Tripoli as soon as the security situation on the ground improves. In the interim, staff will operate from Washington and other posts in the region,"" Harf said in a statement. ""Securing our facilities and ensuring the safety of our personnel are top Department priorities, and we did not make this decision lightly.  Security has to come first.  Regrettably, we had to take this step because the location of our embassy is in very close proximity to intense fighting and ongoing violence between armed Libyan factions."" Militia fighting in the area of the embassy and airport has degraded security in Tripoli significantly. Eyewitnesses in Tripoli told CNN's Jomana Karadsheh that in the early hours of Saturday there was ""a lot of movement with fighter jets and helicopters."" The Libyan government was informed of the evacuation after it was carried out, according to U.S. officials. ""Robust"" force was ready to protect evacuees . The Pentagon had a ""robust package of military forces"" in the vicinity but out of sight, ready to move in if the convoy of evacuees had come under attack. CNN has learned there were two F-16s on combat air patrol overhead, a drone tracking the convoy to the border and a Navy destroyer offshore in the Mediterranean. There were also several dozen heavily armed Marines flying overhead on V-22 Osprey aircraft in an ""airborne response force"" that were prepared to land and rapidly evacuate the Americans during the transit to the Tunisian border if they came under attack. The Pentagon had pressed for weeks to evacuate the embassy, especially after the Tripoli airport came under repeated militia attack, leaving Americans no way to get out via commercial air, the official said. The decision to use vehicles to drive the Americans across the border was seen as the best low-profile approach to conducting the evacuation rather than sending U.S. military helicopters and troops into Tripoli. Harf said the United States will work with Libya and the international community ""to seek a peaceful resolution to the current conflict and to advance Libya's democratic transition."" ""We reiterate that Libyans must immediately cease hostilities and begin negotiations to resolve their grievances.  We join the international community in calling on all Libyans to respect the will of the people, including the authority of the recently-elected Council of Representatives, and to reject the use of violence to affect political processes.  Many brave Libyans sacrificed to advance their country toward a more secure and prosperous future. We continue to stand solidly by the Libyan people as they endeavor to do so,"" Harf said. Secretary of State John Kerry, at the U.S. Embassy in Paris meeting with the Turkish and Qatari Foreign Ministers Saturday, called upon various factions to engage in a political process saying ""the current course of violence would only bring chaos.""  Kerry added that due to the ""freewheeling militia violence that is taking place in Tripoli"" the U.S. along with other countries, one of them Turkey have decided to ""suspended our current diplomatic activities at the Embassy."" Tensions escalate . The United Nations and other international organizations and businesses temporarily evacuated staff from Libya earlier this month. Nearly three years after the revolution and NATO military intervention that overthrew the regime of Moammar Gadhafi, central government has been outgunned by increasingly powerful militias. The civil war has given way to warring militias fighting over Tripoli's international airport. The State Department ""recommends that U.S. citizens currently in Libya depart immediately"" in a travel warning issued on Saturday. This comes nearly two years after attacks on U.S. government facilities in the Libyan city of Benghazi. The assaults of September 11-12, 2012, left four Americans dead, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, and spawned political controversy in Washington. Republican lawmakers have claimed the Obama administration tried to mislead the public about the cause of the attacks and should have done more to prevent them. GOP critics say they plan to make Benghazi an issue for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, under whose watch the attacks occurred, should she decide to run for president. How did this happen?

"A Guatemalan court convicted a former soldier for his role in a 1982 massacre and sentenced him to more than 6,000 years in prison. Pedro Pimentel Rios is the fifth former soldier convicted of atrocities for the killing of 250 people in the village of Dos Erres during the country's civil war. Pimentel was extradited from the United States to Guatemala in July 2011. Relatives of the victims said justice was late, but it finally came. ""By the grace of God I feel quite happy, because really you can see that justice is being done. ... It was an atrocity, what they did,"" said Ramiro Osorio, whose parents and siblings were killed in the massacre. Photos: Searching for the 'disappeared' in Guatemala . The evidence presented by the prosecution and the testimonies of the witnesses proved that Pimentel was involved in the killings, Judge Irma Valdez said Monday. He was sentenced to 30 years each for 201 of the Dos Erres killings and another 30 on a charge of crimes against humanity. The former soldier told family members of the victims in court that he was shocked by what happened, but denied involvement in the massacre and argued that Guatemalan authorities were influenced by foreign interests in the case. ""Now a group of liars are graduating, and this trial is the exam, and they passed it. Everything they said was believed,"" he said. The judge ruled that Pimentel was part of a special unit known as the Kaibiles, who stormed the village, thinking that residents were hiding left-wing guerrillas. Last year, four other former soldiers -- Carlos Antonio Carias Lopez, Reyes Collin Guali, Daniel Martinez Mendez and Manuel Pop Sun -- were also sentenced to more than 6,000 years in prison for the same massacre. That trial was one of Guatemala's first against former soldiers who served in the dictatorship era. More than 200,000 people were killed or ""disappeared"" between 1966 and 1996, the United Nations estimates. The organization documented 669 massacres in Guatemala during the nation's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.","Survivor: ""Justice is being done. ... It was an atrocity, what they did""

"Nothing says ""sore loser"" like threatening to leave the country after an election defeat. And that's what hundreds of thousands of Americans have done by petitioning for their states' secession on the White House website. It's reminiscent of the great British tradition of right-wing celebrities threatening to leave the UK if the Labour Party wins power. Alas, they never do. From the demography and geography of the vast majority of signers, it's tempting to conclude that this is just a Republican cry of rage against four more years of President Barack Obama. But it's more significant than that. Strip away the right-wing fantasies about whether or not secession is really possible (it isn't), and you have a movement that testifies to the extraordinary divisions within American politics. The far right feels angry and dispossessed. Rather than getting even, it's threatening to run away. If it weren't for the sheer number of signatures, the media wouldn't be paying attention. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana describes the secession movement as ""silly"" and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas has dismissed it, too. Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank points out that many of the petitioners live in states that are net beneficiaries of federal largesse: Louisiana gets $1.45 for every $1 it pays in taxes and Alabama gets $1.71 for every $1. Given how much they take from the less mutinous states, he cheekily suggests that the secession petitions ""give the opportunity to create what would be, in a fiscal sense, a far more perfect union."" Meanwhile, The Southern Poverty Law Center notes that the secession effort has attracted a predictable rogues'  gallery of racists and neo-Nazis. Given that there was no similar large-scale effort to secede when Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton or George W. Bush won re-election, liberals can't be blamed for detecting a particular white fury at Obama's success. Legally, secession is impossible, and all attempts to do it have failed. But it's not a philosophically unattractive idea. A democratic society works best when it's rooted in the principle of free association: We all get along with one another because we choose to. Good will is maintained because the individual's membership in the community is voluntary -- were it compulsory, that would breed resentment. But free association only works so long as the individual is free to disassociate when he or she wants. As with individuals, so with nations. In the case of the United  States, the states are historically there by choice. Although there is no mechanism for secession, the generous distribution of powers to the states reflects a spirit of voluntary federation. Since the end of the Cold War we've witnessed the surprising fluidity of supposedly fixed national identities. The Soviet Union broke up, adding 15 new countries to the map. Yugoslavia witnessed terrible wars for national self-determination. Belgium is on the permanent brink of fracture. And my native Great Britain is getting ready for a historic vote on the independence of Scotland. The complexities of Scottish independence illustrate that secession doesn't have to mean a violent rupture sparked by right-wing nationalism. The domestic program of the Scottish nationalist movement is broadly liberal; it will seek to join the European Union and its leaders often insist that the Scottish people will remain culturally British. In Europe's case, the motor for secession is ethnicity. In America, however, it's a politics turned toxic. The 2012 election encouraged the idea that the U.S. is split into two camps that are politically and culturally alien and with opposing economic needs. Mitt Romney's infamous formula of the 47%  (reiterated in his equally ugly post-election remarks about ""gifts"") played upon an old idea that one half of the country feeds off the taxes paid by the other half. Secessionists are likely to be those who see themselves as disadvantaged by the redistributive federal state: as taxpayers bled dry by freeloaders, and  businesspeople penalized by liberal regulation. WKRG-TV found an eccentric example of that when it interviewed the founder of the Alabama petition and discovered that he was furious at the government for shutting down his topless car wash: ""He said he was arrested and charged with obscenity by city officials in 2001. 'The government ripped my business away, and now they're choking America to death with rules and regulations,' he said."" But the 2012 election introduced the idea that the welfare-recipient minority is now the majority. A  common theme in conservative post-election analysis is that the Democrats now have an unbeatable coalition of ethnic minorities, single women and socially liberal youth that is turning the U.S. into a European social democracy. (Mark Steyn: ""Tuesday's results demonstrate that, as a whole, the American electorate is trending very Euro-Canadian."") If that is the consensus among the conservative talking heads, then it's rational for conservative grass-roots activists to conclude that the only viable future for the conservative minority is to form its own country. The call for secession will be mocked and dismissed. But while it is built on a legal fallacy, it does articulate honestly the feelings of a growing number of conservatives who feel emasculated in 21st century America. It's now the duty of the Republican Party to try to integrate them back into mainstream, legitimate politics.","Tim Stanley: Secession movement reveals real feelings of some conservatives .

"A 5-year-old boy freed Monday after being held captive in an underground bunker for six days is laughing and smiling and playing with his favorite toy dinosaur after being reunited with his family, authorities said. The boy's kidnapper is dead, but officials offered no details on the raid that freed the boy -- identified only by his first name, Ethan -- and left his abductor fatally shot. FBI Special Agent in Charge Steve Richardson visited Ethan at a hospital, where he was in a private area with heavy security. ""He is doing fine,"" Richardson told reporters at a late-night news conference. ""He's laughing, joking, playing, eating."" Dale County Sheriff Wally Olson had no new details about Ethan's rescue, and when asked if the boy saw his abductor, 65-year-old Jimmy Lee Dykes, killed during the rescue operation, Olson replied, ""He's a very special child. He's been through a lot, he's endured a lot."" Ethan looks great but will be hospitalized overnight, an uncle told people at a prayer vigil earlier Monday. Authorities said they were still working on the crime scene and the investigation should continue for several more days. The sheriff's office said the bomb squad was checking the bunker for potential explosive devices. Richardson earlier said an FBI team went in to get Ethan after negotiations had broken down with Dykes, who also was ""observed holding a gun."" Olson said it became very difficult to deal with and even communicate with Dykes over the past day. Believing the child to be in imminent danger, an FBI team entered the bunker at 3:12 p.m. CT (4:12 p.m. ET) and rescued the boy, Richardson said. One neighbor said he was outside when he was startled by the sound of an explosion. ""I heard a big boom and then ... I believe I heard rifle shots,"" said Bryon Martin, who owns a home near the bunker where the boy had been held since Tuesday. It was a loud noise that ""made me jump off the ground,"" he said. Authorities wouldn't say whether the blast was set off as a diversionary tactic or whether Dykes had planted explosives around the bunker. After the good news of the boy's release spread through the small rural community, travelers on a nearby highway honked their horns as they drove by. The FBI had borrowed from the U.S. military high-tech detection equipment similar to the technology used to discover homemade bombs in war zones, three Defense Department officials told CNN. It was unclear whether the equipment, which is not readily available to civilian law enforcement, had been used by the FBI. One of the defense officials said no members of the military were involved in the rescue. They would have been acting a technical advisers, the official said. Last Tuesday, police said, Dykes boarded a Dale County school bus and demanded the driver hand over two children. The driver, Charles Albert Poland Jr., refused, blocking access to the bus's narrow aisle as at least 21 children escaped out of the back emergency door, authorities said. The gunman killed Poland, then grabbed a kindergartner before barricading himself and the boy inside a nearby bunker he had built. Smith said Monday that Ethan has siblings, but none of them were on the bus last week. In the ensuing days, officials said little about what was going on in the bunker or in their strategy, or what -- if anything -- Dykes wanted. ""Based on our discussions with Mr. Dykes, he feels like he has a story that's important to him, although it's very complex,""  Olson said Monday before the hostage situation ended. He didn't elaborate. Ethan suffers from Asperger's syndrome and attention deficit disorder, state Rep. Steve Clouse said during the week. Dykes told authorities that he had blankets and a heater in the bunker, and authorities have previously said the bunker -- built 4 feet underground -- has electricity. Authorities did not say how they were communicating with Dykes. Meanwhile, residents and business owners in Midland City put up blue, red and black ribbons in support of the boy and Poland. Blue and red are the local school colors, and black is in honor of the slain bus driver. The U.S. Navy confirmed Monday that Dykes served in the military from 1964 to 1969. Naval records list him as an aviation maintenance administrationman third-class who served with units based in California and Atsugi, Japan. The job entails clerical work related to aircraft and aircraft maintenance, according to the Navy's job description. Neighbors and officials had described Dykes as a survivalist with ""anti-government"" views. Even as the hostage situation continued Monday morning, plenty of police were on hand as schools in neighboring Ozark, Alabama, reopened for the first time since the incident began. Dale County schools remained closed but were to reopen on Tuesday, the district said. In Ozark, school officials decided to begin strictly enforcing a 15-foot safety zone around school buses required by state law. The law prohibits any unauthorized adults, including parents, from approaching within 15 feet of a school bus stop. If an unauthorized adult gets too close, bus drivers are supposed to close bus doors or drive away, if necessary, school officials said .","Rescued child is in good spirits at hospital, authorities say .

"Singing competition shows like ""American Idol"" and ""The Voice"" don't only make stars, they rehabilitate them. Just ask Jennifer Lopez, whose seat at the ""American Idol"" judges' table paved the way for the success of her 2011 album and her recently announced summer tour. Or Maroon 5, who benefited greatly from frontman Adam Levine's spot on ""The Voice."" Even his fellow ""Voice"" judge, Christina Aguilera, cashed in on the group's best-selling single ""Moves Like Jagger."" But for a megawatt star like Britney Spears, who already experienced a comeback of sorts in 2008 with the release of ""Circus"" not long after her fall from grace, a judging and mentoring gig on ""The X Factor"" isn't needed to sell albums. Unlike her aforementioned reality show judge counterparts, Spears joins the Fox singing competition still riding the success of her seventh studio album, and her worldwide ""Femme Fatale Tour."" Even the star's personal life appears to be more in order these days. But the pop princess hasn't exactly been accessible to her fans since she was placed in a conservatorship in 2008. And as stars like Lady Gaga and Beyonce have figured out, there's more to being a singing sensation in 2012 than meets the ear. Fans want to relate to their favorite artists on a personal level, said Andy Greene, an associate editor at Rolling Stone. Becoming a mainstay on a show like ""The X Factor,"" and showing off her personality each week, could reignite the level of fame Spears experienced in the early 2000s, Greene added. Referencing the way Lady Gaga uses Twitter to stay connected to her fans, which she often calls her ""little monsters,"" Greene said, ""(Gaga) is part of their daily life, while Britney is not. And her handlers are realizing they have to loosen the reins a bit."" Even Beyonce has opened up to her fans since the birth of her daughter, Blue Ivy, joining Twitter and giving an intimate glimpse of her offstage life via her Tumblr page. Though Spears has used social platforms to share pictures of her two sons and announce her engagement to former manager Jason Trawick, she's come off as a sort of ""Stepford"" pop star of late, Greene said. ""She walks around like a robot. People can't relate to that,"" he said. ""This could prove to be a whole new phase of her career. Britney 4.0."" And lucky for Spears because, with a reported $15 million contract to appear on ""X Factor,"" this move is likely less about the money than it is about rebuilding her image. ""Britney off the cuff doesn't exist,"" said Phil Gallo, Billboard's senior correspondent for film and TV. ""It's really been a while since we've heard her give any kind of expansive commentary."" To that end, there's a risk involved, because ""the No. 1 dangerous thing that could happen,"" Gallo said, ""is if the artist doesn't appear genuine. You have to feel like that's Britney saying what Britney wants to say. It can't feel scripted, like she has someone in her ear telling her what to say."" While ""The X Factor"" played hardball in the ratings game last fall, fluctuating from 8.5 to 12.5 million viewers each week, the singing competition underwhelmed critics thanks to Simon Cowell's prediction that anything less than 20 million in viewers would be unacceptable. However, with Spears at the judges' table, ratings probably won't be a concern, Gallo said. If the show starts pulling ""Idol""-like numbers, he added, ""it will be driven by, 'What did Britney say?' 'What is Britney going to say?' Out of the gate, that's what it is."" Greene agrees people will tune in, if only to hear her talk. ""If you were a young person between '98 and '07, you find Britney fascinating,"" he said. ""There's just no way around it ... between her craziness and absence."" Of course, Greene added, Britney's team probably wouldn't let her on live TV if she couldn't handle it. ""There's a vote of confidence on Fox's part and Simon Cowell's part and Britney's team's part to say she's ready, and if it goes right, the potential is huge,"" he said. ""The real Britney I used to see is bubbly and funny. It would be nice to see that again.""","Spears joins the Fox singing competition still riding the success of her seventh studio album .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A winter storm that paralyzed the South churned up the Eastern Seaboard Tuesday, threatening heavy snowfalls and more misery for the Northeast. The Southern storm left a trail of treacherous conditions from Arkansas to the Atlantic, closing schools and government offices and contributing to the traffic deaths of at least three people. Southern states were crippled -- covered in sheets of ice that formed on roads, pavements, cars and atop the crunchy snow. Meanwhile, with memories still fresh of a monster Christmas weekend storm, Northern states again braced for heavy accumulations of snow and potential blizzard conditions. The National Weather Service predicted 4 to 8 inches of snow in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, area, 4 inches or more in northern New Jersey and 2 to 6 inches in southern Delaware from Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday morning. It will be all snow as well for the Interstate 95 corridor Tuesday night and Wednesday, with 8 to 12 inches predicted for the New York City area and between 12 to 16 inches in Boston, Massachusetts. The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for coastal Massachusetts, including Boston, on Tuesday night. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo activated the state's emergency management plan in an effort, he said, to ensure resources and equipment are positioned to clear roadways and respond to the approaching storm. Officials declared a ""weather emergency"" and advised motorists to stay off the roads. The move restricts parking and allows authorities to remove vehicles that block roadways or impede snow plows. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who faced sharp criticism over the city's slow emergency response a few weeks ago, said, ""It's going to be a difficult, difficult rush hour."" The city of Philadelphia declared a snow emergency Tuesday night, while public schools in Boston will be closed Wednesday because of the predicted snowfall. At least 30 states were under some sort of winter storm watch or warning Tuesday, and states of emergencies were declared in Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas. Florida is currently the only U.S. state with no snow, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Normally bustling Southern cities such as Atlanta, Birmingham, Alabama, and Charlotte, North Carolina, were silenced by winter, with the crunch of snow boots the only sound in some neighborhoods. Conditions are not likely to improve anytime soon as an Arctic low slides into the South, bringing with it plunging temperatures. Lows are predicted in the teens in many parts of the region and in single digits in higher elevations. Roads resembled ice-skating rinks in Atlanta and parts of major interstates were closed. The U.S. Postal Service said it was only able to deliver to roughly half of its north Georgia and Atlanta-area customers Tuesday. UPS did not make pickups or deliveries in portions of the Carolinas, Alabama and Georgia. ""The ice just made it dangerous and hazardous to ask employees to get out there today,"" said postal spokesman Michael Miles. Atlanta police were dealing with so many accidents that the department announced it would only respond to those with injuries and provided an online form for drivers to report others. The Georgia Department of Transportation warned that ""no one should be driving north of Macon,"" which is in the middle of the state. The worst problem was along Atlanta's normally jammed southern perimeter, which was blocked by semi-trucks that were stuck in the ice. At midday Tuesday, a 15-mile stretch of I-285 remained closed. Several truckers fell asleep in their stuck rigs, and in some cases, Georgia authorities had to call drivers on citizens band radio to wake them up, said Jill Goldberg, a Transportation Department spokeswoman. At Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest, most arriving passengers decided to spend the night rather than risk the drive home, and shared space with stranded passengers who had no choice. Airport authorities handed out blankets and amenity kits, but they did little to ease frustrations. Four out of five runways in Atlanta were operational Tuesday morning. Slick roads were a bigger problem, preventing many airline and airport employees from driving in to work. Delta Air Lines canceled 1,700 Delta and Delta Connection flights, which represented roughly 30 percent of the airline's total flights Tuesday. The company said it had canceled some 800 flights scheduled for Wednesday. AirTran Airways spokesman Christopher White said the airline was resuming operations slowly in Atlanta, but added it would take several days to get back to normal. The company canceled more than 260 flights Tuesday and has already canceled more than 50 Wednesday flights, he said. Most of the canceled flights were into and out of Atlanta, but some were at Northeastern airports, including Boston; Philadelphia; Baltimore, Maryland, and others. Michael Bernardo, an AirTran command center manager, said many of the same issues hampering passengers are also affecting airline workers. Another problem is the icy conditions at the gates. While most of the runways are open, ice at the gates makes working conditions treacherous for those servicing the aircraft. Both Delta and AirTran were offering one-time flight changes with no fees for a limited period. In other parts of the South: . -- One person died Monday in a weather-related traffic accident in Alabama as parts of the state got 6 to 10 inches of snow, said state Emergency Management spokeswoman Yasamie Richardson. -- Two people died Sunday and Monday in traffic accidents in Louisiana. Police cited icy road conditions as contributing factors. -- North Carolina and South Carolina both experienced freezing rain and sleet. Mountainous areas have already seen up to 18 inches of snowfall. South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford ordered state offices in 24 counties closed due to weather and the South Carolina Highway Patrol responded to 2,610 road-related incidents. -- The Tennessee Department of Transportation reported extremely hazardous conditions in the mountainous east, but ice and snow also were causing problems in other parts of the state. Meanwhile in New York, Bloomberg said his city would do everything possible to tackle the storm. ""We're going to spend the money,"" the mayor said, referring to 1,700 snow plows and 365 salt spreaders that sanitation workers will use to beat back the winter weather. ""Then we'll figure out where it's going to come from."" Those same workers are at the center of a citywide investigation into whether their supervisors intentionally delayed cleanup efforts after the Christmas blizzard as a retaliatory measure for budget cuts and demotions. ""The sanitation workers have got to realize that people are going to be watching them,"" Bloomberg said at a news conference. Sanitation union representatives have vehemently denied allegations of a deliberate slowdown, pointing to City Hall for the delayed response. CNN's Dave Alsup, Rob Marciano, Tristan Smith, Moni Basu, Holly Yan, Andy Rose, Nick Valencia and Brian Walker contributed to this report.","NEW: A blizzard warning is issued for coastal Massachusetts, including Boston .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- The Episcopal Church consecrated its first openly lesbian bishop Saturday in the face of objections from some conservative Anglicans. The Rev. Mary Glasspool, 56, is a new bishop surrounded by controversy. Conservative factions in the Anglican Communion, a 77 million-member denomination worldwide that includes the Episcopal Church, have opposed the ordination of gay bishops. Glasspool is the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church since Gene Robinson took office in New Hampshire in 2004. Episcopalians instituted a temporary ban on gay bishops after Robinson's ordination but revoked that ban last summer. The daughter of a priest, Glasspool was one of two openly gay candidates on the slate in the Los Angeles diocese. She has said that her sexual orientation is ""not an issue."" Bishop Jon Bruno of Los Angeles called Glasspool, an ordained priest for 28 years, a ""highly qualified and experienced"" cleric. ""She's not afraid of conflict and is a reconciler,"" Bruno said, according to the Episcopal Church website. He added that Glasspool and her partner of 19 years, Becki Sander, are an example of living service and ministry. Glasspool is the second female bishop in the 114-year history of the Los Angeles diocese, consecrated just hours after the first, the Rev. Diane Bruce, was consecrated Saturday. Glasspool's consecration drew opposition from Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, who said Glasspool's ordination would deepen rifts in the Church. It ""raises very serious questions not just for the Episcopal Church and its place in the Anglican Communion, but for the Communion as a whole,"" said Rowan, according to the church's website. The Church of Ireland also issued a strong condemnation. That church is part of the Anglican Communion in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. ""We wish to express sorrow that Mary Glasspool, a person who is living in a same-sex relationship, is to be consecrated,"" the Church of Ireland said in a statement. ""The elevation to senior church leadership of a person whose lifestyle is contrary to the will of God revealed in scripture is both wrong and disappointing."" Conservatives said the Episcopal Church was taking a provocative step that amounts to a deliberate snub to those in the church who believe homosexuality is a sin.","NEW: Episcopal Church on Saturday consecrated its first openly lesbian bishop .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The U.S. Navy succeeded in its effort to shoot down an inoperable spy satellite before it could crash to Earth and potentially release a cloud of toxic gas, the Department of Defense said Wednesday. A Delta II rocket lifts off, carrying a  reconnaissance satellite that failed hours later. The first opportunity for the Navy to shoot down the satellite came about 10:30 p.m. ET Wednesday. The plan included firing a missile from the USS Lake Erie in the Pacific Ocean west of Hawaii to destroy the satellite. ""A network of land-, air-, sea- and space-based sensors confirms that the U.S. military intercepted a non-functioning National Reconnaissance Office satellite which was in its final orbits before entering the Earth's atmosphere,"" a Department of Defense statement said. ""At approximately 10:26 p.m. EST today, a U.S. Navy AEGIS warship, the USS Lake Erie, fired a single modified tactical Standard Missile-3, hitting the satellite approximately 247 kilometers (133 nautical miles) over the Pacific Ocean as it traveled in space at more than 17,000 mph."" It was unknown whether the missile hit its precise target -- the satellite's full fuel tank. The Department of Defense said it wouldn't know for certain for 24 hours whether the fuel tank had been hit. However, several defense officials told The Associated Press the missile did apparently destroy the fuel tank.  Watch a report on the successful shootdown » . ""Debris will begin to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere immediately,"" the department said. ""Nearly all of the debris will burn up on re-entry within 24-48 hours and the remaining debris should re-enter within 40 days."" However, even if the missile didn't score a direct hit, ""any kind of hit provides a much better outcome than doing nothing at all,"" Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The missile didn't carry a warhead, with authorities saying the impact was expected to be sufficient to destroy the fuel tank. Navy gunners had just a 10-second window to fire, and officials had said they might not be able to take their shot on the first opportunity. Earlier Wednesday, officials had expressed concern about weather conditions, saying the launch could be delayed. However, the 10-second window would have occurred on each of the next nine or 10 days.  Watch Pentagon spokesman Jeff Morrell describe the launch window » . Officials had said the missile would not be fired until the space shuttle Atlantis landed, which it did Wednesday morning, to ensure the shuttle would not be struck by any debris from the destroyed satellite. The attempt cost up to $60 million, according to estimates. Without intervention, officials say, the satellite would have fallen to Earth on its own in early March. However, since it malfunctioned immediately after it was launched in December 2006, it had a full tank -- about 1,000 pounds -- of frozen, toxic hydrazine propellant.  Watch how the failing satellite failed to spark fears » . The fuel tank probably would have survived re-entry if the satellite had fallen to Earth on its own. That could have dispersed harmful or even potentially deadly fumes over an area the size of two football fields. Hydrazine is similar to chlorine or ammonia in that it affects the lungs and breathing tissue. The Chinese military destroyed an aging weather satellite last year, prompting questions about whether the United States is merely flexing its muscle to show an economic and military rival that it can destroy satellites, too. James Jeffrey, deputy national security adviser, denied that this week, saying, ""This is all about trying to reduce the danger to human beings."" But Beijing appears to have doubts. ""China is continuing to closely follow the possible harm caused by the U.S. action to outer space security and relevant countries,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said Thursday. ""China further requests that the United States ... promptly provide to the international community the necessary information ... so that relevant countries can take precautions."" In 1989, a U.S. fighter jet destroyed a U.S. satellite by firing a modified air-to-air missile into space from an altitude of 80,000 feet. That adds to evidence that the U.S. acted Wednesday strictly to guard against the prospect of a potential disaster, said Gen. James Cartwright, vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. The military timed its shootdown attempt so that resulting debris would tumble into the atmosphere and not interfere with other satellites, said Christina Rocca, a U.S. diplomat and expert on disarmament. Her comments were included in an online United Nations report on this month's Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, Switzerland.  See dangers and possible solutions to satellite problem » . The military also timed its efforts to minimize the chances that debris would hit populated areas. But the United States is ""prepared to offer assistance to governments to mitigate the consequences of any satellite debris impacts on their territory,"" according to a report of Rocca's remarks on the Web site of the Geneva office of the U.N. One Pentagon official said that since early January, a team including 200 industry experts and scientists had worked furiously to modify the Aegis air-defense missile system so it could shoot down the satellite. Among the team's challenges was modifying the sensors designed to detect the heat from an incoming warhead, as the satellite will be much cooler. The missile was to release a ""kinetic kill vehicle,"" enabling it to ""see"" the satellite and adjust its course toward it if necessary, officials said. In January 2007, China used a land-based missile to destroy a 2,200-pound satellite that was orbiting 528 miles above the Earth. The impact left more than 100,000 pieces of debris orbiting the planet, NASA estimated -- 2,600 of them more than 4 inches across. The U.S. agency called the breakup of the Fengyun-C satellite the worst in history. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Jamie McIntyre, Suzanne Malveaux and Miles O'Brien contributed to this report.

"The city of Livingstone, in Zambia, is located just 10 kilometers from the spectacular Victoria Falls. Its proximity to the falls makes it a tourist destination, but it also boasts an almost-forgotten past as the home of one of the oldest Jewish settlements in Africa. European Jews first came to Zambia at the end of the 19th century, when it was still Northern Rhodesia. Many settled in the capital, Livingstone. The early arrivals were pioneers looking for better economic opportunities; later they came as refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. Although Zambia's Jewish population was always small -- around 1,000 at its peak -- its members included significant figures in Zambia's economical and political life. Among the most influential was Simon Zukas, who played a key role in Zambia's struggle for independence from Britain in the 1950s, and went on to be a government minister after independence. Discovering the real Zambia . Zukas's father emigrated from Lithuania to southern Africa in 1936 in search of work, as the shadow of Nazism was descending on Europe. He settled in Northern Rhodesia, opening a shop in the town of Ndola, and his family joined him in 1938. Simon Zukas arrived as a 13 year old who spoke only a little English, struggling to adapt to a country where black people were treated as second-class citizens under British colonial rule. ""I knew something about the world because I was part of the Zionist movement in Lithuania,"" he recalls. ""I arrived with sympathy for the underdog, which included the black man. The biggest difficulty was to adjust to the custom of the treatment of blacks. There was a big gulf between the treatment of whites and blacks."" He remembers having to write permits every evening to allow the family's black cook to be able to go home after dark, because he was subject to curfew. Zukas says there was some anti-Semitism from British colonial officials, who could make it hard for Jews to get trading licenses, but generally Jews were welcomed. New arrivals formed a small community together with Jewish families who had immigrated to Northern Rhodesia in earlier years. Hugh MacMillan is a University of Oxford historian and author of ""Zion in Africa: The Jews of Zambia."" He says of the early Jewish settlers: ""The Jews arriving in Northern Rhodesia were both economic migrants and refugees, escaping from a kind of religious and political persecution in the Russian Empire, and also economic migrants looking for a place where they could make a better living."" Lithuanian Jews in particular migrated to South Africa during the diamond and gold rushes at the end of the 19th century, but some pioneers ventured further afield. ""The ones who got to Northern Rhodesia early on were the most adventurous -- frontiers people,"" says MacMillan. ""They were going way out into what were very difficult, remote places, originally as cattle traders."" Among the most influential Jewish immigrants were the Susman brothers, businessmen from Lithuania (then western Russia). They arrived in Northern Rhodesia in 1901 as cattle traders. They settled in Livingstone and went on to build a business empire that included copper mines and ranches. Butterfly farmers help protect threatened forests . MacMillan says the brothers were leaders of Livingstone's small Jewish community and led the construction of the city's synagogue in the late 1920s. The building is still standing, but these days it's used as a Christian church. A casual observer would never know it was once a Jewish place of worship but for the faint outline of the Star of David, the symbol of Judaism, just visible over the main entrance. By the 1930s, there were hundreds of Jews living in Zambia and the rise of the Nazis in Europe brought and a new wave of Jewish immigration. In 1938 and 1939 around 300 German Jews fleeing Nazi persecution found their way to Northern Rhodesia, as did smaller numbers of Jews from Lithuania and Latvia. By the early 1960s, around 1,000 Jews lived in Northern Rhodesia. But after Zambia's independence in 1964, numbers began to dwindle, part of a larger exodus of whites from the country. There are now fewer than 50 Jews left in Zambia. Zukas was an important activist for Zambia's independence. After a stint in the army and at university in Cape Town he campaigned against colonial rule, which led to him being deported to England in 1952. He continued to campaign from London, until being invited to return home when Zambia finally won its independence in 1964. He went on to hold two posts as a government minister and was chairman of the Forum for Democracy and Development opposition party in 2001. While Zukas may be the highest profile of Zambia's Jews, collectively the small Jewish community helped shape the country. ""Individuals of Jewish descent played an important part in Zambian history, especially in commercial business,"" says MacMillan. ""It's a tiny population that has been, or was, influential beyond its numbers.""","City of Livingstone, Zambia, was once the focus of the country's Jewish community .

"Vladimir Putin was the first G20 leader to leave Brisbane. The Russian president's jet lifted off soon as soon as possible -- after the final lunch of the summit meeting, but well before the final communique outlining the achievements of the summit had been announced. Given the mood of the summit, his speedy exit was hardly surprising. Putin had been a verbal punching bag for many of the G20 leaders, critical of Russia's reported movement of new troops and weapons into independent Ukraine. READ MORE: Putin ditches G20 after verbal jabs . Collective slight . It started with a deliberate snub as he arrived -- welcomed at the airport only by a junior minister in Tony Abbott's government. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper greeted the Russian leader the next day with the words: ""I guess I'll shake your hand but I'll only have one thing to say to you -- get out of Ukraine."" European leaders, led by Britain's David Cameron also had words for Putin, as did U.S. President Barack Obama. But Putin put on a happy face when he met Tony Abbott in front of the cameras on Saturday, despite the Australian leader's comments only a few days previously -- accusing him, in person, of trying to ""relive past glories of the Soviet Union"" in Beijing at the APEC summit a few days earlier. The Russian leader looked isolated throughout the Brisbane meetings, but he wasn't the only leader to have a tough G20. READ MORE: G20 agrees to boost growth . Abbott's travails . The host, Tony Abbott also had a difficult summit. It began badly with his first comments to the cameras, as he sat with all G20 leaders at a private retreat. Instead of concentrating on the big global picture, the Australian prime minister chose to tell the most powerful leaders in the world about his own problems on the domestic front, including the difficulties of getting Australians to spend $7 in fees when they visited the doctor. As one delegate said later, imagine having to translate that to the Saudi leader at the meeting. Critics lined up to castigate the Prime Minister's ""whinging"" performance, with opposition leader Bill Shorten describing it as ""weird and graceless."" Carbon mis-step . Abbott also pointed to his success in scrapping Australia's carbon tax. Both the U.S. and Chinese presidents had just days earlier announced sweeping new carbon emission cuts to general praise around the world. Abbott was on the wrong side of the carbon debate throughout the summit, with his government trying to keep it off the official agenda, arguing that the main purpose of the meeting was economics. But, reportedly under strong pressure from both Europe and the U.S., carbon emissions were part of the official final statement. Abbott also did not offer any financial support to Obama's new $3 billion green fund to help developing economies combat the effects of climate change. Productive trip for U.S. The fund was just part of a number of deals and initiatives announced by Obama during his three-country Asian tour. Trade deals and new climate change initiatives flowed from the U.S. camp, with the president clearly enjoying his trip, not to mention his rock-star treatment by students in Queensland and in Myanmar. Similarly, Chinese President Xi Jinping also had a good tour, starting with his own climate change initiatives announced at the APEC summit in Beijing, several new trade deals and a historic handshake with regional rival, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Some commentators are suggesting it could be the beginning of a de-escalation of tensions between China and Japan over territorial disputes in the East China Sea. And it's not over yet for the Chinese leader, who is staying in Australia for the time being. After addressing the country's parliament, a ""speech of historical significance,"" according to his Australian counterpart, he will next head to Tasmania, ticking off the last Australian state he has yet to visit. ""I don't know whether I should get a certificate for that,"" he joked. During his speech in Canberra, Xi announced a free trade agreement that will cover a raft of commercial and governmental deals between the two countries.","Russian President Vladimir Putin endures Ukraine criticism at global meeting in Australia .

"In yet another display of the city's commitment to 24-hour culture, Seoul is unveiling its biggest nighttime attraction yet in the neon-studded, wildly trendy shopping district of Dongdaemun. Designed by Iraqi-British Pritzker Prize winner Zaha Hadid, and completed at a cost of $451 million, the new Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) opens to the public March 21. Commissioned by the Seoul metropolitan government, the plaza features futuristic, spaceship-like curves characteristic of Hadid's previous work -- she's also the woman behind the radical design of the national stadium set for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. DDP will host concerts, conventions and other major events throughout the year. But the first order of business for Seoul's newest landmark and multipurpose cultural center is to kick off 2014 F/W Seoul Fashion Week. Running through March 26, Seoul Fashion Week will feature 81 fashion shows by South Korean designers, as well as Blueprint, a trade show from Singapore's Fashion Week. District makeover . The new building and its adjacent park replace an outdated stadium that had long been an eyesore in an increasingly trendy neighborhood. With most malls in the area open until 5 a.m. (some are open 24 hours), Dongdaemun (""East Gate"") is usually flooded with shoppers, especially at night. The new plaza will be open 24 hours. Architecture and exhibitions . Construction on the 85,000-square-meter structure began in 2007 and was completed in 2013. Exhibition spaces are spread over four floors and three underground levels.

"More than a week after Superstorm Sandy devastated the New York metropolitan area, some commuters will regain something of a sense of normalcy Wednesday morning. The Holland Tunnel is set to reopen to all commuter traffic at 5 a.m., according to a joint news release from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. On an average weekday, the release says, about 91,000 vehicles use the tunnel, which passes under the Hudson River between Manhattan and Jersey City, New Jersey. But for thousands of Sandy's victims, normalcy and reality are far apart. Tired, homeless and emotionally drained, 76-year-old Frank Gissi was not planning to vote Tuesday. The storm-battered ex-New York City cop is among the hundreds of displaced residents in the coastal Staten Island neighborhood of New Dorp with far more basic needs. ""I'm sick, crying,"" he said, eight days after Superstorm Sandy knocked out power and swept away homes. ""I lost everything."" The storm that broke records -- and hearts . Overall, more than 139,000 Staten Island households were affected by Sandy, and thousands there were among about 80,000 New York-area customers still lacking power Tuesday night, according to Con Edison, New York City's largest utility company. Elsewhere, Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited the hard-hit Rockaway neighborhoods of Queens, where sanitation workers continued to clean up downed trees, utility poles and homes. According to the latest count, Sandy has claimed 110 lives across the Northeastern United States. Next, freezing temperatures, lingering power outages and an incoming low pressure system could make matters worse. ""Now if the snow comes in heavy, we're cooked,"" Gissi said. Related: Polling places both 'inspiring' and 'insane' Tuesday morning brought life-threatening cold across the New York metropolitan region, with temperatures dropping into the 20s. Across the entire region hit by Sandy, nearly 9,000 storm survivors spent Monday night in public shelters, the Red Cross told CNN, while others slept in cars or stayed with family or neighbors. Forecasters predict rain will move in early Wednesday and will gradually become heavier, bringing 2- to 4-foot storm surges and up to 45 mph wind gusts. The weather will get worse, CNN meteorologists say, with daytime temperatures hovering in the 40s. ""Mother Nature is not cooperating, and this will complicate the restoration effort,"" said John Miksad, Con Edison's senior vice president of electric operations. At night, it could again get down to the 20s, leaving those without shelter in potentially deadly circumstances, while a renewed risk of floods again plagued the region. Related: Salvaging smeared memories in Sandy's wake . ""A lot of these beaches have had their sand eroded"" by Sandy, creating flood risks in areas that typically do not have them, said Bloomberg, who ordered all parks, beaches and playgrounds closed by noon Wednesday. More than a week after the storm hit, officials painted a picture of a recovery that left many survivors disappointed. In New Jersey, 566,000 customers were without power, Gov. Chris Christie said. ""It is like a war zone down there,"" he said, referring to places such as Mantoloking in Ocean County, where heavy flooding and fires wiped out large sections of the town. At least 20 homes burned to the ground there, mirroring a similar incident in Breezy Point, a neighborhood in Queens New York City, where a cluster of more than 100 houses caught fire during the storm. Related: Five ways to help kids cope with disaster . ""We don't know what to expect for the flooding situation as the shorelines have been changed,"" Christie said. ""For many of them, the dunes are gone. So moderate flooding under normal conditions become major in these conditions."" During the past six days, power has been restored to some 2.1 million customers, he said. But, ""2.1 million people with power back doesn't mean a damn to you if you don't have your power back,"" Christie told reporters. ""I want to see that 566,000 number come down to close to a quarter of a million by end of the day today, if we could. That's the goal."" New Jersey's largest power provider, PSE&G, said it made a dent in that number Tuesday, restoring power to nearly 90,000 of its customers between 6:30 a.m. and 9:45 p.m.  The utility company said it has restored power to about 87% of storm-hit customers so far. ""We hope to have 90% of customers restored by tomorrow morning,"" the company said on its website earlier Tuesday. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the number without power across the state Tuesday was 350,000. As many as 20,000 households across New York City and Westchester are not expected to back online by the weekend because of internal electrical damage to their homes, officials said, though Con Edison tweeted Tuesday afternoon that its crews had restored power to 80% of its Westchester customers. And many of those hunkering down in the dark were stocking up on blankets and fueling their generators on Tuesday as the wintry weather moved closer. ""With this storm coming in, everyone's a little bit nervous,"" said Kevin King, a 41-year-old Maplewood, New Jersey, resident who was still without power. ""I've got twin preemies (premature infants) being released from a neonatal care unit and no power,"" he said. ""I can't leave the area right now, I have to stay local."" Downed power lines and toppled utility poles still littered Maplewood streets, and King said PSE&G has frustrated residents by constantly shifting timetables of when restoration could be expected. ""If I knew it was going to be two weeks -- I know that's bad -- but at least you can plan for it,"" he said. The PATH train between New Jersey and New York restarted limited service under the Hudson River Tuesday, after having been shutdown ahead of the approaching storm last week, while long, slow-moving lines stretched around polling stations across New York City. Elections Commissioner J.C. Polanco called it ""an interesting day"" after the Board of Elections temporarily relocated or combined some polling locations because of storm damage. Related: Powerless in New Jersey . But bigger concerns loomed over the incoming nor'easter predicted for later Tuesday, albeit a far less severe storm than Sandy. ""When it rains, it pours. When it storms, you get more storms,"" Cuomo said. A nor'easter is a strong low pressure system with powerful northeasterly winds coming from the ocean ahead of a storm. ""What has compounded the problem has been the quote-unquote 'panic buying,' "" Cuomo added, referring to long lines that continue to wrap around gas stations as residents frantically stockpile reserves. In Staten Island, resident Katie Fairley, 25, said people were still sleeping in their cars. She said it felt like Staten Islanders had been forgotten, leaving them largely to fend for themselves.

"Actress Ann B. Davis, an American television legend who held ""The Brady Bunch"" together in her role as housekeeper Alice Nelson, died Sunday. She was 88. Bishop William Frey, a close friend of Davis, told CNN the actress died at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas, where she was treated after hitting her head in a fall. The actress suffered a subdural hematoma, he said, and never regained consciousness. Appearing in her trademark light blue maid's uniform with a white apron, Alice anchored ""The Brady Bunch"" with her cheerful attitude and witty one-liners. As the sitcom's famous theme song played, showing each member of the Brady family's face in a grid, the devoted housekeeper was always smiling in the center. In a 2004 interview with the Archive of American Television, Davis described how she created the iconic character. ""I made up a background story. I did have a twin sister, so I used that as a basis. ... I cared very much about this family. It was my family. It was as close to my family as Alice would ever get. I would have died for any single one of them at any point,"" she said. ""You know, they wrote me such gorgeous things to do, as the intermediary between the kids and the adults, and between the boys and the girls. And they gave me funny things to do."" See some of Alice's top moments from 'The Brady Bunch' In real life, Davis said she wasn't quite as handy around the house as her character. ""I basically don't do that well with children, although my sister says I'm a great aunt,"" she told People magazine in 1992, adding that she hated to cook. ""When it's my turn in the house,"" she told the magazine, ""we just eat out."" Even so, Davis penned ""Alice's Brady Bunch Cookbook"" in 1994, featuring recipes from the show and anecdotes from life on the set. Actress Florence Henderson, who played mom Carol Brady on the sitcom, said she was devastated to learn of Davis' death Sunday. ""I am so shocked and sad to learn that my dear friend and colleague, Ann B Davis, died today,"" Henderson said in a Facebook post. ""I spoke with her a couple of months ago and she was doing great!"" Davis had planned to study medicine at the University of Michigan but caught the acting bug from her brother, who was a dancer in the national company of ""Oklahoma,"" according to a biography of the actress on IMDb.com. Her big break in Hollywood came when she won the role of Charmaine ""Schultzy"" Schultz, the secretary on the 1950s sitcom ""The Bob Cummings Show,"" IMDb said. It was that character that won her two Emmy awards, two additional nominations for best supporting actress and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. But to generations of American TV viewers, she was best known as Alice. Frey, who knew Davis for 38 years, said fans often told her that they felt like they'd been raised by the character of Alice. ""Look how well you turned out,"" she would reply, according to Frey. ""All of us wish we had an Alice. I wish I had an Alice,"" Davis told People. ""What you see on 'The Brady Bunch' was who she was,"" Frey said. ""She was a very faithful Christian person."" Davis mostly retired from show business in the late 1970s to settle down in an Episcopal community. ""I'm convinced we all have a God-shaped space in us, and until we fill that space with God, we'll never know what it is to be whole,"" she told People. Even as she turned her focus more toward religion, she appeared in commercials and several stage productions. In the 1995 ""The Brady Bunch"" movie, she played a truck driver, persuading a runaway Jan to return home. While she also shone in movie and stage roles, she told the Archive of American Television that she loved working on the small screen. ""The neatest thing about television is that they write for you. ... They find out what you can do, what you do best, how it works, and how they can use you. And so from there on, it's wonderful. Because it's different. It's not like playing the same play forever and ever and ever,"" she said. ""But the character's still the same. It just gets better and more developed. So that's great fun.""

"The Obama administration condemned Saturday the Taliban's attack on a Kabul restaurant that killed 21 people, mostly foreigners, as revenge for an airstrike that caused civilian Afghan deaths. Among the dead are Americans, Canadians, Britons and Afghans. Two of the three Americans killed were identified Saturday. They are Lexie Kamerman and Alexandros Petersen, both employees at the American University of Afghanistan, the university said. A third American has not yet been named. ""She was an amazing young woman -- smart, strong, beautiful, funny, stubborn and kind. And fearless,"" Kamerman's family said in a statement provided by her aunt, Julie Pfeffer. ""She took the job at the American University of Afghanistan to help the young women of Afghanistan get an education and take their rightful place as leaders in Afghan society,"" the family said. ""As you could probably guess, her death is a shock to us all and we can't imagine a moment going forward when she won't be desperately missed."" Laura Coffman, a  family friend who had been Kamerman's water polo coach at the Latin School of Chicago, said Kamerman had recently visited her mother in Chicago. She said Kamerman was known as someone who never shied away from a challenge or visiting a place considered dangerous. ""I don't think that would make her hesitate a second,"" Coffman told CNN. ""What she would have said was: Just because it's dangerous doesn't mean she shouldn't be there."" U.S. officials excoriated the attack . The bomb and gunfire attack Friday occurred at a Kabul restaurant frequented by foreign workers from nongovernmental organizations. ""There is no possible justification for this attack, which has killed innocent civilians, including Americans,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a prepared statement. ""We call again on the Taliban to put down their arms and begin peace talks, which is the surest way to end the conflict in a peaceful manner. A U.S. State Department official said that three Americans died in the attack. Four of the people killed were affiliated with the United Nations: three U.N. staff members and a Lebanese national with the International Monetary Fund, said Ari Gaitanis, a U.N. spokesman. The attack was ""a heinous and cowardly act targeting innocent people working for a brighter future for Afghanistan,"" National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Twitter. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault as payback for an airstrike in Parwan province that caused civilian casualties this week. Suicide bombing and gunfire . A suicide attacker detonated his explosives at the gate of the restaurant in the evening. Two armed men rushed in and opened fire at patrons, many of them from overseas, said Deputy Interior Minister Mohammed Ayoub Salangi. There were 13 foreigners in total among the dead, including four women, the Afghan Interior Ministry said. The eight Afghans killed in the attack included one woman. Two other people were wounded. One of the two killed American employees of American University of Afghanistan had recently joined the political science faculty, the school told CNN. The other was a member of the student affairs staff. ""We are devastated by the news,"" university President Michael Smith said in a prepared statement. ""Our deepest sympathies go out to the families and to the AUAF community."" The university said it was planning a memorial service and moment of silence for the employees killed in the assault on La Taverna du Liban, a popular Lebanese eatery known among expatriates to be one of the more secure establishments in the city. ""Such senseless violence flies in the face of the sentiments of our students and the Afghan people who share our grief,"" Smith said.  ""We will pause to honor the courageous service of our colleagues as we continue to provide the high quality university education for which our students are so grateful."" 2 Britons, 2 Canadians among the dead . Two British victims of the assault have now been named. One is Del Singh, a candidate for the upcoming elections for the European Parliament from the southeast of England, a spokesman for the opposition Labour Party said, adding that a full tribute was being arranged. ""Del spent over 10 years carrying out vital work on development projects in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Sudan, Sierra Leone and other countries,"" Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said. ""He dedicated his life to working with people across the world who needed his support,"" he said. The Foreign Office named the second victim as Simon Chase, but provided no further information Saturday morning. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Saturday that one of the U.N. workers was a Russian national. A Canadian foreign affairs department spokeswoman said two of her country's nationals -- Martin Glazer and Peter McSheffrey --  died in the attack. Both worked for a consulting and auditing firm in nongovernmental organizations' projects in Afghanistan, said spokeswoman Caitlin Workman. They did not work directly for Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development. Taliban claim attack as revenge . Afghan security forces killed the two gunmen in a shootout. The restaurant is near the offices of many nongovernmental organizations, said Hashmat Stanikzai, a Kabul police chief spokesman. The Afghan interior minister condemned the attack in an online statement, saying ""these heinous acts go against the values of Islam and the values of peaceful Afghans. These attacks also demonstrate an extreme level of atrocity by terrorists on innocent and defenseless civilians. "" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the violence, saying through a spokesman such attacks ""are completely unacceptable and are in flagrant breach of international humanitarian law."" Among the killed was Vadim Nazarov, a senior political officer with the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, a U.N. website said. UNICEF identified two employees as part of the death toll: Basra Hassan, a nutrition specialist, and Nasreen Khan, a health specialist. Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, posted a statement online mourning the death of her agency's representative in Afghanistan, Wabel Abdallah. The 60-year-old Lebanese national was named to that position in June 2008. ""We at the fund are all devastated,"" Lagarde said. 'Huge shock' Afghanistan continues to be the site of sporadic violence, much of it blamed on militants tied to the Taliban. The terror group ruled the country before the U.S.-led invasion after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The international community has been extensively engaged in Afghanistan for more than a decade both with military troops and NGOs. Friday night's attack was a ""huge shock"" to those working there, said Paul Ross, the IMF's mission chief for Afghanistan, but it won't deter them from continuing their work. ""I think that many of the people, like Wabel, are dedicated to trying to help countries develop and prosper,"" Ross said. ""That's really part of their life mission statement. And that's what makes them go to places that are difficult to visit.""","Two Canadians who worked for a consulting/auditing firm are among dead .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Almost 50 percent of the world's primates are in danger of extinction, according to a report from an international conservation group that cites habitat destruction and hunting as the two greatest threats. The golden-headed lion tamarin has been brought back from the edge of extinction. The situation is especially dire in Asia, where the report says more than 70 percent of monkeys, apes, and other primates are classified as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered. ""We've raised concerns for years about primates being in peril, but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined,"" said Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International and chairman of the IUCN Primate Specialist Group. ""Tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause, but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas, even where the habitat is still quite intact,"" he said. The report from Conservation International, issued at this week's International Primatological Society Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland, looked at the world's 634 kinds of primates, mankind's closest relatives. Conservation International funded the review along with the Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation, Disney's Animal Kingdom, and the Swiss-based IUCN, or International Union for Conservation of Nature. The report found that about 90 percent of primate species in Vietnam and Cambodia were at risk of extinction. Populations of gibbons, leaf monkeys, langurs and other species had dwindled, the report said, because of ""rampant habitat loss exacerbated by hunting for food and to supply the wildlife trade in traditional Chinese medicine and pets."" Jean-Christophe Vie, deputy head of the IUCN Species Program, called the situation in southeast Asia terrifying. ""To have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is, quite frankly, unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date,"" he said in a news release. Great apes like gorillas and bonobos still faced challenges in Africa, the report said, but it was the smaller primates -- such as the red colobus monkey, with its striking white, black and rust-colored coat -- that could die out first. In Africa, 11 of the 13 kinds of red colobus monkeys assessed in the report were listed as critically endangered or endangered, and two may already be extinct, the report said. Bouvier's red colobus has not been seen in 25 years, and despite occasional sightings, no primatologist has recorded a living Miss Waldron's red colobus since 1978, the report says. Primates are important to the health of their surrounding ecosystems, the report's authors say, supporting a wide range of plant and animal life in the world's tropical forests. Healthy forests, in turn, provide vital resources for local human populations. Reforestation is crucial to restoring primate populations because it restores their habitat, the report said. It cites the cases of the black lion tamarin and golden lion tamarin in Brazil, which were downgraded from critically endangered to endangered after three decades of conservation efforts. ""If you have forests, you can save primates,"" said Anthony Rylands, a scientist with Conservation International and the deputy chair of the IUCN Primate Specialist Group. ""The work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates, but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.""","Report: Almost 50 percent of world's primates in danger of extinction .

"Editor's note: Mark Sawyer is associate professor of African American Studies and Political Science at UCLA and the director of the Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Politics. His published work includes a book, ""Racial Politics in Post-Revolutionary Cuba,"" which received the DuBois Award for the best book by the National Conference of Black Political Scientists and the Ralph Bunche Award from the American Political Science Association. Mark Sawyer says practitioners of blackface always try to justify it, but the defenses don't ring true. (CNN) -- Harry Connick Jr. almost got it right when he challenged the doctors who mocked the Jacksons in blackface on an Australian version of ""the Gong Show."" The fact is, even Australians know better. It isn't that they did not know that what they were doing was shocking and offensive; they just thought they could get away with it. ""If they turned up looking like that in the United States,"" he said on the ""Hey Hey It's Saturday"" television show, ""Hey, hey, there's no more show."" In a message posted on his Web site, Connick wrote that ""in the American culture, the blackface image is steeped in a negative history and considered offensive."" He also wrote, ""I do not believe that the performers intended any harm."" Let's put this in context. Australians have their own ugly history of racism against Aborigines. One in which half-white, half-Aborigine children were forcibly taken from their mothers and raised in group homes so they could learn to properly integrate into white society. They know better. There is no cultural context in which blackface minstrelsy is okay or acceptable. Blackface is one of the most pernicious and painful stereotypes about people of African descent. It is also global. Blackface has appeared everywhere from Mexico to Japan, and it is always ugly, despite what those who put it on claim. The doctors who did the Jackson ""tribute"" claimed that they were honoring Michael Jackson. They were mocking him, and that is what blackface has always been. The same applies for those like a responder on the Guardian Web site who suggests that blackface models presented in French Vogue magazine are simply cultural play: ""The American cultural imperialists of the Anglosphere are out in force again."" It is neither imperialist or wrong to point out racist imagery, even if done in good fun. In a cruel twist, the commenter takes the victims of racism and imperialism and calls them the perpetrators. But both the photographers and French Vogue are aware of the problems of racism in Europe and the barriers black women face in the fashion industry. Like old blackface minstrelsy, when you can't find blacks you think are worthy to play the part, you simply blacken up white actors or, in this case, models. The message: Real black people aren't good enough at being themselves. Whether it is the original white ""Amos and Andy"" or white fraternity/sorority girls and boys, blackface is always about mocking black skin and presenting stereotypical black behavior. Minstrels always clown around, sing and dance and otherwise dehumanize the individuals they represent. The blackface itself by whites reduces them to one critical feature: their black skin. And in almost every case, even this one, it's exaggerated. None of the Jacksons are that dark; it is a rank racial caricature. It always has been. Even in the early days of blackface minstrelsy, those who practiced it did not see themselves as promoting pernicious racial stereotypes and hatred but, like the doctors on the Australian show, honoring fun aspects of African-American culture and being. No one then or now who uses blackface cops to saying, ""I intend to dehumanize black people."" Everyone has an excuse or an alternative explanation of what it means. From the frat boys to the Spanish Formula One fans mocking black driver Lewis Hamilton to the soccer fans who throw bananas on a soccer field in Europe just for fun, they all make attempts to excuse the behavior by saying they're personally not racist and they never meant to hurt anyone. The most common response is, they don't understand the reaction. But they do. Blackface is always designed as comedy, to shock, to mock and to get a few laughs. For a Jackson tribute, one can see the prisoners from a jail in the Philippines dancing to Michael Jackson's ""Thriller."" Their moving homage didn't need blackface. Jackson's music and dancing were what moved, motivated and captivated them, not his skin color and hair texture. So whether it's racist caricatures on Mexican stamps or Australian doctors, the signs and symbols of demeaning black people are universal. They transcend continents, cultures and genres. At the same time, so are the denials. The people who traffic in them always have the same set of denials. They did in late 19th-century and early 20th-century America, and they do now in Australia, Mexico or Spain. They do it because they want to honor black people, they want to take in black culture and expression, and they can't do so without putting on blackface. They also all know it is offensive but think it isn't so offensive that they can't get away with it. They just can't resist race and blackness as the vehicle for comedy. Research shows that whites in countries like Cuba, Brazil, France and many others often express higher levels of racism against blacks in surveys and experiments that tap unconscious attitudes than in the United States. The rancor that has surrounded race in the United States -- while not creating a post-racial America -- has at least moved the dial substantially in terms of racial attitudes among whites and made a substantial portion of them more sensitive to the issue. Though many other countries look down upon the U.S. racial past, they often do so at the expense of asking hard questions about their racial present. The United States is certainly not perfect, but we also have elected a black president and come a long way toward making anti-racism a norm. Such that a white Southern musician recognizes an ugly racial caricature when he sees one. Harry, as a son of the South, you were both calling it right but also being polite. I applaud you for calling it as it is, but you gave them too much credit for ignorance. They knew they were offending; they just thought, like many others, they could get away with it. Fortunately, they didn't. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Sawyer.","Mark Sawyer: Harry Connick Jr. was right to condemn Australian use of blackface .

"Buckets of snow falling in Boston. Ice cracking trees and bringing down power lines in the Northeast. Temperatures as much as 40 degrees below normal in the High Plains. Another day, another storm, in what's proving to be a wet, wild and nasty winter. From the Midwest to New England, more than 120 million people are yet again bundling up against cold, ice, snow or all three, according to CNN meteorologists. Some are taking it in stride. ""Only perk of going to school in Boston: SNOW DAYSSSSSSSS,"" Facebook user Carla Torres posted. Others were ready for it to be all over. One item frequently shared Wednesday over social media was a picture of an angry-looking baby, with the words ""What do you mean more snow ..."" superimposed on it. Here's a look at what winter's bringing around the country: . Who's getting hit worst? For snow and ice, parts of the Midwest and Northeast in a band running from Illinois east all the way to Maine. For cold temperatures, it's the nation's midsection, from Montana east to Wisconsin all the way south to northern Texas. What's the forecast? It's going to be awfully cold in the Plains and High Plains -- as much as 40 degrees below average in some places, according to the National Weather Service. In Helena, Montana, for instance, Wednesday's high is forecast to be 3 degrees below zero. That compares with 2 degrees on Tuesday and the average high of 36. Snowy, icy conditions are expected from eastern Missouri into the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. Up to 2 inches of snow per hour may fall around Boston, with as much as a foot of snow predicted in parts of Massachusetts. Who's being affected? In New York, where heavy snows are taxing salt reserves, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared an emergency for the entire state and shut down Interstate 84. ""New Yorkers in affected regions should stay off the roads, check on their neighbors and loved ones, and stay inside their homes until the worst of the storm has passed,"" he said in a statement. Transportation regulators waived rest rules for salt-truck drivers to get remaining salt stockpiles moved to where they are needed: New York City and Long Island. In Pennsylvania, Villanova University announced that it would be closed Thursday and Friday after the school's power provider projected an extended outage in the area. And in Kansas, authorities announced a third weather-related death from the storm: a 58-year-old man died overnight after a traffic accident Tuesday, the Kansas Highway Patrol said. In Boston, the weather seemed little nuisance. CNN iReporter Jenifer Schwartz, visiting from California, marveled at how the city handled the storm. ""My flight home today is one of the many that was canceled, but getting a cab this morning to get to meetings around the city did not prove to be too much of a problem,"" she said. Relative Boston newcomer and native Southerner Josh Parsons was just trying to process it all. ""Since this is my first winter in the North, the snow still feels like a novelty to me,"" he told CNN on Wednesday. ""I enjoy seeing it falling and enjoy walking around in it right after the fresh snow. Having said that, I do not like some of the things that come along with the snow."" Such as? Salt, slush and the simple fact all the snow just won't go away. ""The roads get cleared, the sidewalks get cleared, but then there are just mounds or brown, dirty ice piled up everywhere,"" he said. Meanwhile, in Michigan, two Delta Air Lines aircraft got stuck in the snow in unrelated incidents at Detroit Metro Airport. This comes a day after a Southwest Airlines plane hit a snowbank as it was taxiing to a gate in Kansas City, Missouri, according to airline spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger. Nationwide, airlines had canceled nearly 2,800 flights, according to flight tracking website Flightaware.com. Most-affected among major airports include New Jersey's Newark Liberty International, New York's LaGuardia and Boston Logan International. The Federal Aviation Administration also reported significant delays at airports in Chicago, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina. Why all the severe weather this winter? Boston is about 8 inches ahead of its normal snowfall pace for the year, the National Weather Service said. In New York, the number is 23 inches. It's not unusual or unprecedented, Radley Horton, a climate scientist with Columbia University, told CNN's New Day. ""If we look at winters in the past, we can get this kind of setup with a very wavy jet stream. Colder air spills into one side (while) the other side of the country has extremely warm weather,"" he said. But climate change -- particularly the way melting Arctic sea ice may be affecting jet stream patterns -- could be increasing the frequency and severity of such wild weather rides, he said. ""There's always going to be variability,"" Horton said. ""There's always going to be these waves in the jet stream. But it does seem, according to some research, as we lose that sea ice in the Arctic, one possible surprise could be more cold air spilling south, more warm air going north.""","Third storm-related death announced in Kansas .

"Delbert Belton fought to the end. Police said Monday that the 88-year-old World War II vet, who died last week after a brutal beating in a parking lot in Spokane, Washington, tried to fend off his attackers. Two teenagers are in custody, including one arrested early Monday. Belton's death on Thursday came 68 years after he survived being shot in the leg during the World War II battle of Okinawa. ""He came close to losing his life in service to this country on Okinawa, and then he gets killed needlessly on the parking lot while he was waiting for a friend,"" Spokane police Chief Frank Straub Jr. said. Belton's efforts to defend himself may have worsened the attack, Straub said. The Spokane County Medical Examiner's Office said Belton died of blunt facial and head injuries. Straub said information provided by church leaders and family members led investigators to a Spokane apartment where they found 16-year-old Kenan Adams-Kinard early Monday morning. Police arrested him in connection with Belton's killing and arrested three others who were with him on charges of rendering criminal assistance, a felony. Straub did not identify the other three, and it was not immediately clear if they were adults or juveniles. He described them as friends of Adams-Kinard, one of two teenagers accused of trying to rob Belton in the parking lot of Spokane's Eagles Lodge. Straub called it a botched robbery, and said race did not appear to play a role in the attack, despite public speculation to the contrary. Authorities named Adams-Kinard during the search for him even though he is a juvenile, saying ""he represents ... an actual danger to the community."" Authorities have not released the name of the first suspect, who was taken into custody last week. But his lawyer identified him as Demetrius Glenn, also 16. Glenn had his initial appearance in district court on Monday and was advised of the charges, said attorney Christian Phelps. ""We didn't argue bond and it was previously set at $2 million,"" he said. It was unclear when Adams-Kinard would make his first court appearance. Both suspects were charged with first-degree murder and first-degree robbery, Straub said in a statement. Random killings spark laments, but reality shows long slide in crime rate . Monique Cotton, a spokeswoman with Spokane police, said the teens were charged as adults. Coming just days after an Australian baseball player died in a shooting that police said was conceived by three teenagers out of boredom, Belton's death shocked with its apparent brutality and random nature, and left friends and family wondering why it happened. ""He didn't drive a big fancy car. He didn't didn't dress in expensive clothes. He didn't have a lot of money,"" Belton's daughter-in-law, Barbara Belton, told CNN's Alina Machado last week. ""What did they think they were going to get from this man?"" Belton, a retired aluminum company worker, was wounded during a battle on the Pacific island of Okinawa while fighting in World War II. He was affectionately known to friends as ""Shorty"" because of his diminutive height. ""He was awesome,"" Lillian Duncan told The Spokesman-Review newspaper. ""Anybody that didn't get to know him missed out on a wonderful angel in their life.""","The two 16-year-olds are charged as adults, a spokeswoman says .

"A CNN correspondent was harassed by Turkish plainclothes police as he was live on air, reporting on tensions between the officers and demonstrators on the first anniversary of mass protests in Istanbul. International correspondent Ivan Watson had just finished explaining that police had closed off central Istanbul to prevent demonstrators from being able to lay flowers at the sight of last year's protests when he himself was manhandled by officers. Viewers of CNN International on Saturday morning watched as officers demanded to see Watson's press credentials and passport, as well as those of his crew. The camera kept rolling as the officers grabbed Watson and started walking with him. One officer kneed him in the back. They also broke the microphone off CNN's camera while wrestling it out of the hands of the cameraman. The veteran reporter told anchor Errol Barnett, ""Errol, we're being detained right now."" Watson and his team were escorted in police custody. Police officers argued that Watson's press accreditation, issued by the Turkish prime ministry, could have been ""counterfeited"" and that he had to produce a passport.  He was not permitted to leave until the passport was retrieved from the nearby CNN bureau. But officers didn't arrest him. According to Watson, after about a half-hour, the CNN team was released, and another officer apologized for the officer who had kneed him. Police also apologized for the inconvenience. Watson is based in Istanbul. In his 12 years in the country, the press credential has sufficed as proper identification for reporting. The demand to see a passport was unusual. He was at Taksim Square, where mass protests surged a year ago. The protests began over the proposed development of a park but swelled in large anti-government demonstrations that were met with a government crackdown. Activists called for nationwide demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the protests, but, as Watson reported, police were denying them that opportunity. On Saturday, Gezi park -- the place where the protests started -- was closed off, and both riot police and plainclothes officers were deployed in large numbers. The Turkish government accuses protesters of trying to undermine Turkey's economy and is not allowing public displays of dissent, especially in this sensitive place, Watson said. Protesters say they want to express their opinions freely. As night fell Saturday, police fired tear gas in Taksim Square to disperse the demonstrators. There were some scuffles between groups of protesters and riot police.","Ivan Watson was reporting live from Istanbul for CNN when cops approached him .

"If that isn't a wave out there on the horizon, it is, at the moment anyway, a big, Republican-leaning ripple. Consider this: . -- A new CNN/ORC poll shows President Barack Obama's standing on terrorism issues is in sharp decline just as voter concerns about ISIS is climbing. -- In that same poll, released Monday, more and more Americans see the country as heading in the wrong direction -- always one of the most telling indicators of the electorate's mood. -- Recent days also have brought a handful of polls in key Senate races that suggest Republican advantages in Kentucky, Arkansas and Alaska and only a narrow Democratic lead in Colorado. Odds of a GOP takeover of the Senate are looking up eight weeks to Election Day. CNN poll: Key Arkansas Senate race a dead heat . CNN poll: McConnell holds slim edge in Kentucky . ""It's much better to be a Republican candidate than a Democratic candidate, at least at the moment,"" says veteran GOP pollster Whit Ayres. ""Yes, the Republican brand sucks, but it is the President's image that dominates midterm elections, not that of our party."" If nothing else, the next few days are going to reinvigorate the debate over what constitutes a wave. Smart operatives in both parties for weeks now have shied away from that word -- mostly because there are fewer competitive House districts now than in past cycles. So, even if the GOP has a great Election Night, it is unrealistic to believe there could be a 30-seat gain in the House, as the Democrats enjoyed in 2006. Or a 60-seat pickup like the tea party wave in 2010. This cycle, GOP strategists say a great night would be adding 15-18 seats to the Republican majority; Democrats are hoping to keep their losses in single digits. Congress to-do list: Avoid shutdown, go campaigning . But the improving Senate climate for Republicans has reignited ""wave"" talk. ""I am now expecting a substantial Republican Senate wave in November, with a net gain of at least seven seats,"" the veteran prognosticator Stuart Rothenberg wrote Monday. Ayres is waiting for a bit more evidence. ""I don't see any evidence of a wave like we had in '06 or '08,"" says Ayres. ""But a few more polls like the one you cite could get me to change my mind."" In the CNN poll numbers, the encouraging news for the President is that he and the public are largely in sync about how muscular to be in responding to ISIS.  A clear majority opposes American combat boots on the ground, but 50% support using other military force, up from 34% a year ago. Challenges to predicting the November election results . But there is this damning finding: 67% say Obama does not have a clear plan for dealing with ISIS. Plus, only 37% approve of how he is handling ISIS, and just 41% approve of his handling of the broader terrorism issue. Perhaps the President can change those bad reviews with his speech to the nation later this week. Even so, his job approval rating is stagnant at 43%, and the percentage of Americans who think things are going badly in the country stands at 55%, up from 50% in April. Again, eight weeks is a long time. And Democrats insist they will again surprise us with superior voter outreach and turnout. But for now, the numbers are compelling: A weak President and a worried electorate are the trademark ingredients of a wave. Or a really big ripple.","Poll numbers indicate a sizable advantage for GOP in this year's midterms .

"While Labor Day is the unofficial end of summer, it's also the unofficial start to the campaign season. That means politicking will be on the rise, especially as control of the Senate is at stake as well as control of 36 state houses. So, if you turn on your TV, expect to see more -- and nastier -- political advertisements. In fact, Elizabeth Wilner, senior vice president of Kantar Ad Intelligence, says as much as $3.4 billion is going to be spent on advertising this midterm season. The race with the most at stake is the one for U.S. Senate in Kentucky. This is not just one of the only Senate races Republicans are at risk of losing, but also the race where the top Senate Republican is at risk of losing his job. The Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is in a fight for his political life against Alison Lundergan Grimes, a relatively inexperienced Democratic politician who was just 8 years old when McConnell started his first term in the Senate in 1985. McConnell, a shrewd politician, prolific fundraiser and expert campaigner, has had numerous missteps, making this race even more interesting. His troubles include a flubbed campaign ad, a campaign manager who was a little too honest, the recent resignation of that manager and a caught-on-tape moment. Grimes, meanwhile, has also stumbled when talking about foreign policy, and questions have arisen about a possible sweetheart deal involving her campaign bus. This is one of the most interesting and critical races in the country. How Mitch McConnell crushed the tea party . Here are four other races that are worth watching: . Wisconsin governor: The Wisconsin governor's race has many national repercussions, as Republican Gov. Scott Walker is locked in a tight re-election battle against former Trek bicycle executive Mary Burke. Economic policy is a central component of this campaign. Walker has gained prominence in conservative politics for governing as a fiscal conservative and making deep cuts to spending by cutting public union workers' pensions. He also drastically limited workers' bargaining rights. Meanwhile, Democrats, backed by labor unions, are again fighting to defeat Walker -- they forced a recall two years ago that Walker won -- to move forward on more Democratic economic policies, including lifting the minimum wage. Walker, who is also being investigated for alleged illegal campaign coordination with outside groups, is considered a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, but if he loses his gubernatorial race, his path to the presidency will be very, very narrow. Democrats and Republicans understand the stakes, and President Barack Obama traveled to Wisconsin on Labor Day to speak at a union event in a trip packed with political symbolism. Walker, Burke tied up in new poll . U.S. Senate, Louisiana: Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu always has tough races, and her fourth bid for the Senate seat is no exception. Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy is the person who is giving Landrieu another difficult run. Cassidy is tying Landrieu to Obama in this conservative-leaning state while painting her as a corrupt Washington insider. Landrieu, meanwhile, is attempting to paint her Senate tenure as a picture of independence. Most interestingly, a political roller coaster is possible. If Landrieu or Cassidy doesn't receive more than 50% of the vote on Election Day in November, a winner won't be named until that state's December 6 election. There's a chance the Louisiana race, and the balance of the Senate, might be dragged out until December. Sen. Mary Landrieu to reimburse Senate for charter flight . National Democrats go after Cassidy on Medicare . U.S. Senate, Iowa: When popular Sen. Tom Harkin decided to retire, Democrats had a small panic attack as this solidly Democratic seat was now in play. But when Rep. Bruce Braley jumped in, Democrats' confidence was restored. But then that confidence has been shaken as Braley has run a gaffe-prone campaign that involves digs at farmers and meandering chickens. His missteps -- combined with the surprising strength of Republican candidate Joni Ernst, who has run a great campaign that began with a breakout performance in the crowded Republican primary -- make this a possible and unexpected pickup for Republicans. Climate group attacks Ernst on tax pledge, not climate . Florida's 2nd Congressional District: There is little to no chance that Republicans will lose control of the House of Representatives, and some race analyzers say the GOP will even pick up seats. But this race could be a bright spot for Democrats. Even in what is expected to be a difficult year for Democrats, Democratic candidate Gwen Graham could pull out a victory in this Republican-leaning district of Tallahassee and the central part of the Florida Panhandle.

"Jerusalem (CNN)An adult and two minors have been indicted in what Israeli authorities say was the revenge killing of a Palestinian teen -- a death that helped stoke tensions between Israelis and Palestinians this month -- an Israeli district attorney said Thursday. Israeli authorities say the three abducted, beat and burned Mohammed Abu Khdeir, 16, ""only because he was an Arab,"" the Jerusalem district attorney said. Abu Khdeir's body was found in a Jerusalem forest on the morning of July 2. Prosecutors allege the killing was retaliation for the deaths of three Israeli teens whose bodies were found in the West Bank in late June. ""The indictment (that was) filed elaborates on a serious and shocking racist act carried out against (an) innocent boy,"" the attorney general's office said. The suspects are a 29-year-old man from the West Bank settlement of Adam and two of his 16-year-old relatives -- one from Jerusalem and the other from Beit Shemesh, Israel, prosecutors said. Abu Khdeir was heading from his home to a mosque in the middle-class neighborhood of Shuafat in East Jerusalem for prayers around 4 a.m. on July 2 when three people forced him into a car and drove off, his father, Hussain Abu Khdeir, told CNN. Prosecutors say the three defendants strangled and beat Abu Khdeir. Then, while he was unconscious, they burned him to death, prosecutors say. News of the boy's death led to several clashes in Jerusalem's Palestinian neighborhoods, the biggest of which was centered in Shuafat. Residents there threw stones at security forces, and Israeli authorities responded with occasional volleys of stun grenades and tear gas. During one of those clashes on July 3, Abu Khdeir's American cousin, Tariq Abu Khdeir, 15, was beaten by Israeli police. Amateur video showed Israeli police officers holding down, punching and kicking Abu Khdeir, a Florida resident who was visiting relatives. The 15-year-old and his family have said he did nothing wrong, and he returned to Florida this week after a brief home detention. Israeli authorities say they have suspended a police officer accused of beating him. The death of the Palestinian teen, Abu Khdeir, came less than a month after three Israeli teens -- Eyal Yifrach, 19; Gilad Shaar, 16; and Naftali Frankel, a 16-year-old dual U.S.-Israeli citizen -- were abducted while hitchhiking home from school in the West Bank. They were found dead on June 30. The Israeli government blamed the Islamic militant group Hamas, which praised the abductions but denied it was responsible. Israel responded in part by arresting Hamas activists. Militants in Gaza, the Palestinian territory that Hamas controls, stepped up rocket fire into Israel, and Israel responded with airstrikes. Starting roughly on July 7, Israel started an intense anti-Hamas airstrike operation in Gaza. At least 230 Palestinians have been killed and close to 1,700 have been injured since the operation began, according to Palestinian health officials. The rocket fire from Gaza has killed one man in Israel. Defendants accused of other crimes against Arabs . Two people indicted in Abu Khdeir's death -- the man and one of the minors -- also are accused of trying to commit crimes against Arabs in the East Jerusalem area on July 1, including trying to kidnap a 7-year-old and trying to burn cars, the Jerusalem attorney general's office said. As in the Abu Khdeir case, revenge was the motive, prosecutors said. They hurt both the child and his mother, prosecutors alleged without elaborating. Earlier, on June 15, the same two burned a shop in the Palestinian village of Hizma near Jerusalem because the man was angry with someone there, prosecutors said. CNN's Tal Heinrich reported from Jerusalem. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta.","Prosecutors: Adult, two minors retaliated for June deaths of three Israeli teens .

"From a sheep ranch in Western Australia comes the oldest slice of Earth we know. Scientists say they have dated an ancient crystal called a zircon to about 4.4 billion years, making it the earliest confirmed piece of the planet's crust. The findings -- the first to describe the zircon -- were published in the journal Nature Geoscience on Sunday. ""This is the oldest and the best dated of all the crystals that have been reported,"" said John Valley, lead study author and professor in the Department of Geoscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This crystal is a translucent red, Valley said, but glows blue when bombarded with electrons. At 400 micrometers long, its biggest dimension is just a tad larger than a house dust mite, or about four human hairs. The crystal was found in an arid region north of Perth, Australia, in a low range of hills called the Jack Hills, in 2001. Scientists say the crystal's chemistry -- specifically, the ratio of oxygen isotopes within it -- suggests that the temperatures on Earth 4.4 billion years ago would have supported liquid water, and therefore perhaps life. Two isotopes of an element are considered different if they contain different numbers of neutrons. ""What we've learned is that the Earth cooled much more quickly that people had thought,"" Valley said. ""The surface formed a crust much more quickly than people thought."" A brief history of Earth . Our planet is thought to be about 4.5 billion years old, but the oldest fossils are about 3.5 billion years old. That doesn't necessarily mean that no life existed before that time, but no direct evidence has been found yet. The first rocks that have been found deposited by water are about 3.8 billion years old, Valley said. But very little is known about the first 600 million years or so of the planet's history, known as the ""Hadean Eon"" because it was thought to be ""hell-like,"" Valley said. The leading theory is that Earth was bombarded by meteors in its early history. It took a big hit from an object the size of Mars about 4.5 billion years ago, leading to the formation of the moon. These impacts vaporized the Earth's crust and formed a super-hot magma ocean. Evidence including this zircon suggests that within the first 100 million to 200 million years of its existence, our planet cooled enough to make crust. Steam from the atmosphere condensed to make oceans. ""Once you know that there were oceans, it's very reasonable that there would have been life that early"" -- even when it was only 200 million years old, Valley said. How they did the study . Valley and colleagues reported on a different crystal from early Earth in 2001 from the same Jack Hills area. But there had been an open question regarding that crystal and others about how to determine the age. The standard method of dating such rocks involves looking at the radioactive decay of uranium atoms to lead. But if the lead has moved within the crystal over time, this could lead to a faulty estimate of age. If lead has migrated away from the area of the rock being tested, that could make the rock appear younger than it is, or older if lead has concentrated itself. In this new study, researchers used a technique called atom-probe tomography, which allows scientists to image single atoms of lead and determine the isotope ratio. Scientists found that clumps of lead atoms had formed 1 billion years after the zircon crystallized. These clusters are tiny, about 5 to 10 nanometers in diameter. All that means that the lead atoms hadn't moved enough to thwart scientist's existing methods of determining the crystal's age, Valley said. They determined that age to be 4.4 billion years old. ""Although incredibly laborious, their analytical technique can be applied to not only additional terrestrial zircons but also to zircons from meteorites and lunar samples, to perhaps tease out a detailed thermal history of magmatism and impacts,"" Samuel Bowring, professor of geology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in an accompanying article in Nature Geoscience. Meanwhile, on Mars . Earth and Mars formed around the same time in the solar system. Just as scientists are analyzing the chemical composition of rocks on Earth to learn about our planet's history, NASA's Curiosity rover is doing the same on Mars. But one can only do so much via robot. NASA is planning a 2020 rover mission that may be able to collect samples for later delivery to Earth. There, we may find even more extraordinary gems -- red or otherwise.","Earth is about 4.5 billion years old .

"Sure, Fido is a brown Lab. But inside, he may also be a little green. New research suggests that dogs can exhibit jealousy, a human emotion usually ascribed to squabbling siblings or the jilted third of a love triangle. A study by scholars at the University of California, San Diego found that dogs showed jealous behaviors when their owners displayed affection toward an animatronic stuffed dog that barked, whined and wagged its tail. The dogs snapped at and pushed against the stuffed dog and tried to get between it and the human. This may come as no surprise to any owner of multiple pooches who has seen them jostle for space on someone's lap. And it's not unusual for people to assign human feelings to their dogs, whose baleful eyes seem like deep pools of emotion when compared with those of, say, cats. 5 ways pets benefit your health . But animal-behavior experts say the study is a significant step forward in understanding our dogs' emotional lives. ""This is the first study I know of that directly asks this question: Do dogs get jealous?"" said Marc Bekoff, author of ""Why Dogs Hump and Bees Get Depressed: The Fascinating Science of Animal Intelligence, Emotions, Friendship, and Conservation."" The study by Christine R. Harris and Caroline Prouvost was published Wednesday in PLOS One, a peer-reviewed online scientific journal. For their research, the authors videotaped 36 dogs individually at their homes while their owners ignored them and interacted with a series of three objects: the fake dog, a children's book and a plastic jack-o'-lantern. The canines included 14 small breeds such as pugs, dachshunds, corgis and terriers. Researchers chose small breeds so they could more easily control the dogs if they acted out violently. The dogs acted jealous when their owners petted the stuffed dog and talked sweetly to it as if it was real, although they displayed less such behavior when the owner showered attention on the pumpkin or read aloud from the children's book, which had pop-up pages and played melodies. In this way, the study suggests, the dogs' jealousy was triggered by social interaction and not merely by their owners' ignoring them for an inanimate object. Eighty-six percent of the dogs sniffed the butt of the toy dog during the experiment, so many of them may have seen it as real. New app helps you find lookalike for Fido . The findings mirror those of other studies that found human babies as young as 6 months displayed jealous behaviors when their mothers interacted with a realistic-looking doll. The infants did not act jealous, however, when their mothers attended to a nonsocial item such as a book. ""These results lend support to the hypothesis that jealousy has some 'primordial' form that exists in human infants and in at least one other social species besides humans,"" the study said. Although most animals clearly demonstrate primal emotions such as anger or fear, studies have been less conclusive in determining whether dogs are capable of more complicated feelings such as guilt or shame, Bekoff said. But research has shown that dogs do understand when they're being treated unfairly, he said. ""Dogs are really keen social observers,"" Bekoff said. Animal behavioral expert Patricia McConnell, author of ""For the Love of a Dog"" and other books, said she was impressed with the new study's methodology. But she's not surprised by its findings. ""I think we share a tremendous amount of emotional life ... with dogs,"" she said. ""But I have never thought of jealousy as a particularly complex emotion (in animals). Is human jealousy exactly like dog jealousy? I'm sure it's not."" Does your dog ever act jealous? Share your experience in the comments section below.

"Actor Russell Johnson, best known as Professor in the 1960s TV sitcom ""Gilligan's Island,"" died Thursday, his agent said. Johnson was 89. Johnson played the iconic role of Professor Roy Hinkley, whose scientific schemes to get the castaways rescued were always foiled by Gilligan's bumbling. He died at his home in Washington, where he lived with his wife, Connie. She and their daughter, Kimberly, were at his side, said agent Mike Eisenstadt. Johnson is also survived by a stepson, Court, and a grandson, he said. Johnson worked up until his death, signing autographs over the holidays, said Eisenstadt. He called Johnson's death ""unexpected."" The chief deputy coroner in Kitsap County, Washington, told CNN that Johnson died from natural causes. Johnson was ""just a positive and nice guy"" who always treated people with respect, his agent said. His acting career began in the early 1950s with many jobs as a character actor on television. He played Marshal Gib Scott in two seasons of ""Black Saddle,"" a Western that ran in 1959 and 1960. Johnson acted in dozens of television shows after the four seasons on ""Gilligan's Island,"" but his career seemed stranded on its own island because of the popular sitcom role. A noteworthy big screen role was as a nuclear physicist in the 1955 science fiction film ""This Island Earth."" Share your memories . Johnson was in Ray Bradbury's 1953 sci-fi classic ""It Came From Outer Space."" Before becoming an actor, Johnson served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. He was on a B-24 Liberator when it was shot down during a bombing raid over the Philippines in 1945, according to his official biography, and used his G.I. Bill benefits to pay for acting school after the war. Johnson, in a 2004 interview for the Archive of American Television said the success of ""Gilligan's Island, which he never expected to last more than the initial order of 13 episodes, was the result of the ""great chemistry"" of the cast. Tina Louise, who played the glamorous Hollywood starlet Ginger on ""Gilligan's Island said she was "" very saddened to hear of the passing of Russell Johnson."" ""My prayers and condolences go out to his wife Constance and his family,"" Louise said.  ""He will always be in our hearts and remembered from Gilligan's island as part of American pop culture history. He will truly be missed."" Advice to young actors . Johnson's advice to young actors was to ""prepare yourself."" ""Most of us have to really learn how to do what we do, and that takes some studying and being part of an acting group,"" he said.  ""Preparation is everything, and that means studying."" Another important ingredient to acting success is perseverance, he said.  ""You can have all the talent in the world, but if you don't persevere, if you don't stick to it, it doesn't mean anything.""","Johnson played the iconic role of Professor Roy Hinkley on ""Gilligan's Island""

"Our galactic neighborhood just got a lot bigger. NASA on Wednesday announced the discovery of 715 new planets, by far the biggest batch of planets ever unveiled at once. By way of comparison, about 1,000 planets total had been identified in our galaxy before Wednesday. Four of those planets are in what NASA calls the ""habitable zone,"" meaning they have the makeup to potentially support life. The planets, which orbit 305 different stars, were discovered by the Kepler space telescope and were verified using a new technique that scientists expect to make new planetary discoveries more frequent and more detailed. ""We've been able to open the bottleneck to access the mother lode and deliver to you more than 20 times as many planets as has ever been found and announced at once,"" said Jack Lissauer, a planetary scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California. Launched in March 2009, the Kepler space observatory was the first NASA mission to find planets similar to Earth that are in, or near, habitable zones -- defined as planets that are the right distance from a star for a moderate temperature that might sustain liquid water. Tuesday's planets all were verified using data from the first two years of Kepler's voyage, meaning there may be many more to come. ""Kepler has really been a game-changer for our understanding of the incredible diversity of planets and planetary systems in our galaxy,"" said Douglas Hudgins, a scientist with NASA's astrophysics division. The new technique is called ""verification by multiplicity,"" and relies in part on the logic of probability. Instead of searching blindly, the team focused on stars that the technique suggests are likely to have more than one planet in their orbit. NASA says 95% of the planets discovered by Kepler are smaller than Neptune, which is four times as big as Earth. One of them is about twice the size of Earth and orbits a star half the size of Earth's sun in a 30-day cycle. The other three planets in habitable zones also are all roughly twice the size of Earth. Scientists said the multiplicity technique is biased toward first discovering planets close to their star and that, when further data comes in, they expect to find a higher percentage of new planets that could potentially have a life-supporting climate like Earth's. ""The more we explore the more we find familiar traces of ourselves amongst the stars that remind us of home,"" said Jason  Rowe, a research scientist at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, and co-leader of the research team.","Four of 715 newly discovered planets may support Earth-like life .

"Talking about race and class makes people uncomfortable. If that were not the case, we'd have more open conversations about these issues with our friends, families and co-workers, and would no doubt be a more understanding and loving society across the board. The situation in Ferguson, Missouri, after the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager, throws America's problem with talking about race into sharp relief. So if adults are having trouble talking openly about race and class, it's easy to see why some parents are either afraid, uncomfortable or unwilling to bring the topics up with their children. ""Talking about race, dealing with race, explaining race is hard,"" blogger Brandi Riley wrote on her Facebook page. Riley, who is African-American, told me her main priority when she talks to her 5-year-old daughter Ayva about race and class is teaching her that it's OK to be different. ""I don't want her to think that we're all the same, or to grow up not seeing color,"" said Riley. ""That's not realistic, and what happens to children that grow up like that is they aren't able to empathize or understand when things like Ferguson happen because 'they don't get what the problem is.' "" Riley, who blogs about parenting at Mama Knows It All, encourages parents not to be afraid to talk about race with their kids. One of the easiest ways to discuss it, she said, is to read books with children that showcase diversity. ""Expose them to cultures outside of their own through classes, or travel, and be intentional about it,"" she said. ""As much as we'd like to believe it, racial tolerance (and) acceptance doesn't just happen. It takes work. It takes being open to understanding and learning about each other's history, and making the commitment to teach our children as well."" Felicia King, a mother of three in Willingboro, New Jersey, said her family hasn't really had an on-going conversation about race because they have friends from so many different countries and cultures and haven't personally had to deal with racism. That said, King did talk to her son, who is 25 and almost 6 feet tall, about dealing with police officers -- a conversation many parents of color say they've had with their sons. She's made it clear that he has to be prepared for the possibility that some authority figures will judge him by his race before anything else. Opinion: Are we Ferguson? ""I taught him you must, when you're with an officer or anyone else say, 'Yes sir.' Give them that respect first and it benefits you."" The fact that African-American parents have to have that conversation with their sons -- a conversation most white moms would never think of having, pains Marcy Cohen, a white mom with a 1-year-old son in New York City. ""To talk to your child as if your child is seen as a threat is so upsetting,"" she said. Cohen said even before her son can talk, she and her husband are doing what they can to expose him to people of all walks of life, races and income levels. As a white boy growing up in a family with economic means, she also wants him to realize he's lucky and to see all human beings, regardless of race and class, as equal to him. ""I feel like there's a fear of others that we put into our children and I desperately do not want to put that on him,"" the stay-at-home mom said. For some white parents, there is a discomfort about talking about race especially since it's not something they live every day. There is also the painful realization of some of the social and economic benefits for whites of systemic racism, said blogger Elizabeth Broadbent, creator of the site Manic Pixie Dream Mama. In a blog post that has been widely shared in social media, the mom of three sons challenged white parents to recognize and talk with their children about ""white privilege."" ""For a mother, white privilege means your heart doesn't hit your throat when your kids walk out the door. It means you don't worry that the cops will shoot your sons,"" Broadbent wrote. ""It carries another burden instead. White privilege means that if you don't school your sons about it, if you don't insist on its reality and call out oppression, your sons may become something terrifying. Your sons may become the shooters."" It is uncomfortable and scary for some people to recognize the ""unfairness and injustice""  in a country that was, in some ways, ""founded on the principles of white supremacy and continues to maintain itself on principles of white supremacy,"" said Stephen Pimpare, author of ""A People's History of Poverty."" ""What I think is often very frustrating to poor and low income people who tend to be disproportionally people of color is the sense that people in positions of power don't recognize that and are still sort of in denial about that,"" said Pimpare, who is also an adjunct associate professor at Columbia University and New York University. Parents who live that reality day-in and day-out can't help but share their experiences with their children. Shelly Watson of Berkeley, California, an African-American woman with a biracial father, said her parents talked with her about race when she was very young and she has had similar conversations with her daughter, now 21. ""I've always taught my daughter that racism is still there and a lot of times it's very subtle,"" said Watson, who works at a major health care company as a computer coder specializing in electronic medical records. She said she's always told her daughter that as an African-American woman, she is ""going to be looked at differently."" Watson experienced that herself the day before our conversation when, during a visit to a New York City department store, she says she was followed around as she shopped. ""So when people say race doesn't matter, that is not true,"" she said. ""Racism will never die in this country until people change the way they perceive others and otherness in general."" Watson's daughter, Persiah Acorn, said she didn't really understand what her mother was talking about until she encountered racism in high school. Since then, she has watched people perceive her a certain way just because of the color of her skin. ""If I had on, let's say, clothes just like you, let's say I even worked at CNN, it wouldn't make a difference. People still treat me the same way because I'm African-American,"" said Acorn, a senior at Howard University. Opinion: Ferguson: The signal it sends about America . ""People still scoot away from me on the subway. I've had open seats and no one sits next to me, and it makes me wonder why. ... For some reason, there's still almost a fear or a distaste for me just because of my race."" One way to bridge the distance, Pimpare said, is to embrace the scary and uncomfortable -- and have conversations about race with our children. ""We're terrible about talking about race in particular and the way that we get better at talking about race is talking about race, and we have to find ways to do it,"" he said. What do you think is the best way to talk to children about race and class?

"A Bosnian immigrant who authorities said came within days of carrying out a plot to bomb New York City's subway system was sentenced to life in prison on Friday. Adis Medunjanin, 34, had been charged with conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction and conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda. After authorities foiled the plot, he then attempted to crash his car and kill himself and others. Medunjanin chanted versus in Arabic from the Quran in front of Judge John Gleeson as a part of his statement to the court.  He went on in English also criticized the U.S. for wars, hunger and torture. Medunjanin's immediate family and extended wept as he spoke to the court. Medunjanin maintained his innocence and denied being involved in the any subway bombing plot.

"In the dead of night, in the bohemian Los Angeles district of Fairfax, a ""guerrilla"" street artist is about to start work. In his day job as a professional photographer he has been in riots where rocks and iron bars were being thrown. That has given him an almost innate sense of detecting danger, but as long as he is careful and quick, this particular installation should pass off without incident. He lurks in the shadows on North Genesee, near the junction of Melrose Avenue with the tools he needs -- two stencils and two cans of aerosol paint, one black and one yellow. One last time, he glances up and down the street, making sure that  ""Black and Whites"" -- the name given to the L.A. Police Department's Ford Crown Victoria vehicles -- are not cruising nearby. With the coast clear, he gets down to work. Ten minutes later it is done. He breathes a sigh of relief and steps back to admire his latest masterpiece. It is a stenciled image of fallen American hero Lance Armstrong. The Texan is depicted wearing that iconic yellow Tour de France leader's jersey aerodynamically hunched over the handlebars of his bike. But something jars -- poking out of the disgraced cyclist's back is an intravenous drip, a graphic reference to the 41-year-old's doping past that has finally caught up with him. Armstrong admits doping . 'Are there any heroes anymore?' In infamy, just as he did in fame, Armstrong continues to hold powerful sway over the public's consciousness. Over many years he had vehemently denied cheating as he bestrode the world of cycling in the process of winning seven successive Tour de France titles -- now taken away from him -- until confessing to Oprah Winfrey that he had used performance-enhancing drugs and had illicit blood transfusions. The credits had barely rolled on that interview before reports of book deals and film rights of his spectacular fall from grace began to emerge. Now Armstrong has been immortalized in a piece of street art -- named ""Are there any heroes anymore?"" -- which is reminiscent of the subversive and polarizing exhibits of British graffiti artist Banksy at his very best. ""I was a keen cyclist, cycling three or four days weeks and doing a 90-kilometer ride on a Sunday,"" the work's creator ""Plastic Jesus"" told CNN, explaining why he was moved to labor for several hours in his spare time with his scalpel to produce the two stencils that were used to create the Armstrong exhibit. ""Lance was the ultimate cycling hero for me. He took cycling out of the geek enthusiast arena and brought it to a mainstream audience. People bought bikes and wore lycra because of Lance's profile, success and status,"" says the 48-year-old, who is also from Britain but moved to L.A. in 2007. ""I was following the story right from the start of the early drug allegations, and in conversations with friends, I'd support Armstrong and tell them that he was just an just an exceptional cyclist, genetically designed that way. ""I felt let down by Armstrong -- as I'm sure fellow cyclists, sportsmen and the general public did. I wanted to convey that by a piece of art."" ""Plastic Jesus,"" who chose that tag due to his atheism, previously ran a news photography agency in London that dealt with Britain's major newspapers -- hence his experience of covering riots. He continued to work as a photographer in the U.S. but inspired by Banksy -- his favorite image by the notoriously reclusive Bristolian is ""The Flower Thrower"" -- he began to experiment with stencils, scalpels and aerosol cans in homage to a subculture that began on the streets of New York in the 1970s. ""The art is in the message -- it's not about the technical quality of the piece,"" said the 48-year-old. ""I like the simplicity of conveying a quite deep political or cultural message."" Staying out of jail . Caution is the watchword when ""Plastic Jesus"" heads out to pursue his alter ego's creative impulses. ""Graffiti artists can face a $6,000 fine and imprisonment, and for multiple offenses it can lead to a federal court, which is very bad news,"" says the artist, who has never been caught when daubing his impressions on L.A.'s walls. From graffiti to galleries: Street vs. public art . Despite the risks, he loves his art so much he is considering giving up his day job as a photographer, though that depends on whether there is a demand for his work and ""if I can stay out of jail."" His latest creation has already featured in the Los Angeles Times as well as two British national newspapers, while the media coverage has led -- more bizarrely -- to two marriage proposals on Twitter. "" 'Are There Any Heroes Anymore?' has been creating quite a buzz,"" says Greg Linton, editor-in-chief of the street art blog Melrose and Fairfax. ""It could be said that 'Plastic Jesus' is becoming the Banksy of L.A."" And, just as Banksy has had problems with local councils cleaning up areas covered in his artwork, you might have to be quick if you want to see the latest message from ""Plastic Jesus."" The owner of this particular wall, which is also a favored spot for other L.A. street artists, whitewashes the graffiti away every so often...","Graffiti artist immortalizes Lance Armstrong's fall from grace on a Los Angeles wall .

"The Supreme Court on Wednesday unanimously ruled that police may not search the cell phones of criminal suspects upon arrest without a warrant -- a sweeping endorsement for privacy rights. By a 9-0 vote, the justices said smart phones and other electronic devices were not in the same category as wallets, briefcases, and vehicles -- all currently subject to limited initial examination by law enforcement. Generally such searches are permitted if there is ""probable cause"" that a crime has been committed, to ensure officers' safety and prevent destruction of evidence. Criminal suspects in Massachusetts and California were separately convicted, in part, after phone numbers, text messages, photos and addresses obtained from personal electronic devices linked them to drug and gang activity. Those cases were appealed to the high court, giving it an opportunity to re-enter the public debate over the limits of privacy rights, with a focus on the ubiquitous cellphone and its vast storage of information and video. The appeals were not related to the recent mass surveillance of phone metadata by the National Security Agency, which has raised similar constitutional concerns. ""The fact that technology now allows an individual to carry such information in his hand does not make the information any less worthy of the protection for which the Founders fought,"" the ruling said. ""Our answer to the question of what police must do before searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simple — get a warrant."" Ellen Canale, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the agency would work with law enforcement to ensure ""full compliance"" with the decision. ""We will make use of whatever technology is available to preserve evidence on cell phones while seeking a warrant, and we will assist our agents in determining when exigent circumstances or another applicable exception to the warrant requirement will permit them to search the phone immediately without a warrant,"" Canale said. Most people have cellphones . A January Pew Research Center survey found more than 90 percent of Americans now own or regularly use a cellphone, and 58 percent have a more sophisticated smartphone. They have become the most quickly adopted technology ever. It's estimated that most of the world's 7 billion people have access to mobile devices, according to the United Nations. Lower courts nationwide are divided over how to apply a 40-year-old high court precedent allowing searches of a suspect's items after arrest. Home searches generally require warrants and are given greater constitutional protection than vehicles or a person in public. Of the two cases addressed by the Supreme Court, David Riley's attracted the most scrutiny. Two convictions . He was detained in 2009 for having an expired vehicle registration and driving with a suspended license. When authorities impounded his vehicle, loaded weapons were found hidden under the hood. After the college student's subsequent arrest, San Diego police took a look at his smartphone. Text messages, contacts and video in the touch-screen device led officers to believe Riley had organized crime connections. A photograph of another vehicle owned by the suspect was linked to an earlier drive-by shooting. He was convicted in state court and received a 15-year prison sentence. Separately, Brima Wurie was arrested in 2007 for selling two packets of crack cocaine. He had an old-style flip phone in his pocket, and police in Boston used call logs on the device to trace his real home address, after the suspect gave a bogus one. There, officers with a search warrant found more drugs, a weapon and ammunition. Wurie was convicted in federal court and is serving 22 years. In neither case did police seek a warrant before the phones were searched. One appeals court upheld Riley's conviction, and another tossed out Wurie's. Broader impact . Unclear from the high court's ruling is whether other defendants convicted on such electronic evidence will also have their cases dismissed. But the court minced no words in separating such devices from other things a person might have on them when detained by police. ""Modern cell phones, as a category, implicate privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or a purse,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. ""Cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense from other objects that might be kept on an arrestee's person."" The Constitution's Fourth Amendment protects against ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" But the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed the government's discretion to conduct warrantless initial pat-downs and searches of people and vehicles -- to ensure officers' safety and prevent destruction of evidence. That included a 1973 ruling upholding the police search of a suspect's crumpled cigarette box, where heroin capsules were discovered. The motorist had first been stopped on suspicion of driving on a suspended license in Washington. Cellphones different . Similar law enforcement searches can include other closed containers, such as wallets and address books, even if it is not initially apparent the items are contraband or dangerous. But privacy advocates and defense attorneys had argued that portable, easily storable technology makes these appeals different. The court, in sweeping terms, agreed.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The U.S. military launched airstrikes targeting ISIS fighters around a key dam in western Iraq on Sunday, the Pentagon said. It carried out the airstrikes near Haditha Dam at Iraq's request, according to Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary. Anbar Province Deputy Governor Faleh al-Issawi told CNN that Iraqi forces launched a ground offensive with the protection of U.S. air cover and strikes. The aim of the offensive, he said, was to retake the area around the district of Barawana, which is about 6 miles west of Haditha. The city of Haditha and its dam have remained under the control of Iraqi security forces and Sunni Arab tribes despite ISIS' numerous attempts to seize them. If the terror group seizes the dam -- the second-largest in the country -- it could prove catastrophic. It provides water to millions of people in western and southern Iraq. Al-Issawi said the area was being used by militants to launch mortar and other attacks on Haditha and the dam and officials have been concerned that these attacks could hit the dam and cause flooding that would impact the entire province. The United States also fears the militants could use the water to flood villages and seize control of the nation's lucrative electricity industry. ""We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam, which remains under control of Iraqi security forces -- with support from Sunni tribes,"" Kirby said. Fighter and bomber aircraft carried out four airstrikes that destroyed ISIS positions and equipment, including Humvees, a checkpoint and a bunker, U.S. officials said. Dams as war weapons . ISIS fighters have sought to turn Iraq's dams into weapons. The group, whose acronym stands for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, now refers to itself as the Islamic State. Earlier this year, ISIS fighters opened the gates of Falluja Dam in an effort to stop an Iraqi military advance. Water from the dam flooded various villages. U.S. forces have kept an eye on Haditha Dam on the Euphrates River, where Iraqi troops held off an ISIS assault last month. The Pentagon said operations will continue to ensure Iraqi forces maintain control of the dam. ""Potential loss of control of the dam or a catastrophic failure of the dam -- and the flooding that might result -- would have threatened U.S. personnel and facilities in and around Baghdad,"" Kirby said in a statement. Recapture of largest dam . Last month, U.S. airstrikes helped Kurdish and Iraqi forces recapture Mosul Dam from ISIS. A breach of that dam, the largest in Iraq, would have endangered Iraqis who live downstream and the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad, U.S. President Barack Obama said at the time. If it gave way, it would send walls of water racing down the Tigris River toward Mosul and its 1.7 million inhabitants. Massive flooding would affect major cities farther downstream, including Baghdad. Mosul Dam had been the center of an intense battle between the ISIS extremists and Kurdish forces. The U.S. military used air support to help Kurdish forces, including fighters, bombers and unmanned aircraft. ISIS militants have killed thousands of Syrians and Iraqis as the Sunni extremist group seeks to build an Islamic caliphate stretching across a swath of territory. The militants have executed two American journalists in recent weeks, slayings analysts describe as a propaganda tool. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reported from Baghdad, and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Joe Sutton and Tom Dunlavey contributed to this report .","NEW: Anbar Province leader: Iraqi forces fought on ground near Haditha .

Many liberal and progressive activists don't trust Clinton because they think she sides with big banks and big money instead of the middle class and they're wary of her on national security. With a Clinton presidential campaign a possibility, they want the same treatment New York voters got. What would cause Clinton not to run for president? ""If there was an actual, authentic 'I am going to listen to you about your issues' from Clinton, instead of kind of pounding the drum of inevitability and stampeding over the left on her way to assumed victory, that would be effective,"" said Sally Kohn, a progressive activist, CNN contributor and Clinton critic. Until then, the trust deficit between Clinton and the left of her party will grow, Kohn and other liberals predict. Activists point to Clinton's voting record in the Senate, where she voted to authorize the Iraq war and increase domestic surveillance. They say that and decisions her husband made while president, like the Defense of Marriage Act and the authorization of the North American Free Trade Agreement, give her little street cred among liberals and populists. 5 things we learned from Bill Clinton interview . Possibly the biggest concern among liberals is Clinton's coziness with Wall Street, their big bogeyman. Since leaving the State Department in 2013, she has spoken at events sponsored by Wall Street giants like Fidelity, Goldman Sachs and Ameriprise Financial, and during her Senate runs and 2008 presidential run, Clinton defended lobbyists. ""I don't think she has been aggressive on the banks,"" said Nelini Stamp, a progressive political organizer from New York. ""When I think of Hillary Clinton, I actually think she is in bed with some of the banks and Wall Street is her ally."" There is also an overarching suspicion among liberals that Clinton is saying what she needs to get elected, but would govern differently. ""You wonder if it is a pivot or whether she is saying what the moment demands,"" Kohn said. Starting in May, before Clinton crisscrossed the country selling her book ""Hard Choices,"" the former secretary of state started to talk about populist and liberal issues like college affordability and income inequality. Zelizer: Are Democrats afraid of the income inequality issue? Clinton told an audience at the liberal New American Foundation in May that ""the dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach"" and because of that, ""many Americans understandably feel frustrated, even angry."" Clinton has also recently labeled college affordability ""one of the biggest problems we have in the country,"" and says if she were elected president she would ""tackle growth, which is the handmaiden of inequality."" People close to her have started to trumpet her record on pay equity and the minimum wage. ""She has come with a more populist tone because she knows what people want to hear,"" Stamp said. Asked if she trusts Clinton when she talks about income inequality, Stamp said bluntly, ""Right now, not that much."" Clinton would back limits on money in politics . Clinton's changing message has been overshadowed by gaffes during her book tour, like countering questions about her wealth by saying her family was ""dead broke"" when it left the White House. At the same time, possible opponents from the left -- like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Vice President Joe Biden -- have generated more buzz among liberals as alternatives to Clinton. Other than changing her tune, Clinton hasn't been quick to address liberals who have questions for her. Instead of sitting down with them -- something that a candidate would certainly do, especially one battling distrust -- she has continued to hold events around her book and her family's foundation. Polls might explain why she hasn't reached out yet: Right now, liberals don't matter that much to whether Clinton would win the Democratic nomination in 2016. A CNN/ORC International Poll from June found that only 11% of Democrats want a more liberal option to Clinton. Twenty percent want someone more conservative and 63% want Clinton. What's more, a Washington Post/ABC News poll from the same time showed that 72% of self-described liberals supported Clinton, a number that was larger than moderate and conservative Democrats. But liberals do make a lot of noise. Some of that has already boosted possible opponents from the left. Earlier this month both Biden and Warren ignited the crowd of liberal bloggers and activists at the annual Netroots Nation conference in Detroit. Warren's speech was interrupted by chants of ""Run, Liz, Run"" from eager supporters who want to see her challenge Clinton for the presidency. Clinton wasn't there, instead continuing with her ""Hard Choices"" memoir tour in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Madison, Connecticut. While Stamp, who attended Netroots Nation, said there wasn't an overarching feeling of being snubbed by Clinton, she acknowledged, ""It would have been interesting to hear her in a progressive setting."" ""People want to hear from a potential candidate and have those candidates hear about the work they are doing on the ground,"" she added. After the conference, left-leaning Democrats said they felt more energized and organized than ever -- and they hope that will lead to more influence on who their party nominates in 2016. Rubio calls Clinton a '20th century' candidate . ""She shouldn't be the inevitable candidate,"" said Erica Sagrans, the campaign manager for Ready for Warren, an effort to enlist Warren to run for president in 2016. ""Our take is that no one should feel like they can't support a candidate that they like or are excited about just because there is a lot of support for Hillary."" Ready for Warren is a direct response to what many liberal organizers say is an assumption of inevitability among the cadre of groups and political operatives organizing for a possible Clinton campaign. The name itself is a play on Ready for Hillary, an organized group of Clinton loyalists who have raised over $8 million to help Clinton if she chooses to run in 2016. Sagrans, whose group received a great deal of attention at Netroots this month, said it hopes to ""channel the excitement about Warren into tangible results and a tangible organization."" But just as much as the group's goal is to ""elevate Warren,"" as Sagrans said, progressives also want to direct the 2016 conversation. On this goal, progressives seem to be winning. Clinton has talked more about populist issues since embarking on the book tour and will likely be forced to continue this rhetoric if she runs for president. And liberals hope their influence will grow with time. ""There is this sort of inherent question, is Hillary ready for us?""  Kohn said about 2016. ""It is not enough to just be the next in line. The question is: Are you really, truly listening?"" Clinton stands by 'Russia reset' comments in the face of events .","Progressives see Clinton as closer to the banks than to the middle class .
Clinton's record on national security also makes them wary .
Liberals like Elizabeth Warren and Martin O'Malley are getting some buzz on the left ."
"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama's administration admitted it erred by failing to send a higher-ranking representative of the United States to the Paris unity march on Sunday. ""I think it's fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday afternoon. He said Obama himself would have liked to attend the march ""had the circumstances been a little different."" But planning began Friday night, 36 hours before the event began, and there wasn't enough time for the ""onerous and significant"" security work that needed to take place ahead of a presidential visit, Earnest said. He said Obama's presence also would have meant extra restrictions on the people who were there. ""That said, there is no doubt that the American people and this administration stand foursquare behind our allies in France as they face down this threat,"" he said. ""And that was evident throughout last week."" More than 40 world leaders, including the British, German and Israeli heads of state and Russia's foreign minister, joined at least 1.5 million people on the Paris streets Sunday for a unity march that became France's biggest-ever public demonstration. But Obama and his administration's top hands were nowhere to be found -- an absence that triggered complaints that he missed a key leadership opportunity. The United States appeared to have options to send to the march: Obama spent Sunday at the White House with no public events on his schedule. Vice President Joe Biden was at home in Delaware for the weekend, also with a blank public schedule. Outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder was already in Paris for security meetings -- and even recorded interviews with several U.S. Sunday morning programs -- but he didn't attend the march. A Secret Service official said the agency was not asked to draw up security plans for a potential presidential trip to Paris in advance of Sunday's march. ""We weren't asked or notified about a trip,"" the official said. But the agency had Secret Service agents on the ground in Paris, per its standard operating procedure. ""It would have been a challenging advance ... based on what we know,"" Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said. But Leary did not say that such an advance would have been impossible. During the White House briefing, Earnest suggested security challenges were a factor in not having the president travel to Paris. But Earnest acknowledged the Secret Service could have pulled it off. An agency official noted previous ""last minute"" presidential trips have happened during the Obama presidency, including a hurried visit to South Africa in December 2013 for the memorial service for Nelson Mandela. The White House noted that it was represented in Paris on Sunday -- and has offered support to France in recent days. U.S. Ambassador to France Jane Hartley was in the march, as was assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland. At a security summit, Holder was joined in those security meetings by deputy Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Obama personally visited the French Embassy in Washington last week to offer his support. Secretary of State John Kerry, meanwhile, will visit Paris on Friday. Kerry skipped Monday's march because he was in India on Monday for a long-planned event there with new Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- a key relationship as the United States tries to improve long-strained trade ties with the country. Kerry brushed the criticism off as ""quibbling,"" saying he'll visit Paris on his way back to the United States to make ""crystal clear how passionately we feel"" about the attacks and response. ""The U.S. has been deeply engaged with the people of France since this incident occurred,"" Kerry told reporters, adding that the United States has offered intelligence and law enforcement help. ""This is sort of quibbling a little bit in the sense that our assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was there and marched, our ambassador was there and marched, many people from the embassy were there and marched."" France's ambassador to the United States, Gerard Araud, sought to show there are no hard feelings, tweeting on Monday: ""I am extremely grateful for the overwhelming support France has received from everybody here, from the President to the ordinary American."" The White House's push-back comes as Obama takes heat -- particularly from Republicans considering 2016 presidential bids -- for his absence. Rick Perry tweeted that Obama ""should have stood with France in person to defend Western values and show support for victims."" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wrote for Time: ""Our President should have been there, because we must never hesitate to stand with our allies."" And Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Monday that ""it was a mistake not to send someone."" Rubio said on CBS' ""This Morning"" that he understands that the President's security detail can be problem in mass gatherings like the rally, but suggested Holder or Kerry should have gone in his place. ""I think in hindsight, I would hope, that they would do it differently,"" Rubio said. British Prime Minister David Cameron,  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov were among those who attended, along with religious leaders. Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN's ""Global Public Square,"" called the absence of top U.S. officials a mistake. France is the United States' ""deepest ideological ally,"" he said, and it would have been a meaningful image to have a senior administration member, or the President, standing shoulder to shoulder with other leaders. Zakaria noted that security concerns didn't dissuade Netanyahu or Abbas or other leaders from showing up. But Obama's absence did show that the struggle against radical Islam is ""not all about America,"" Zakaria said. ""Many people have tended to think that Islamic terrorism wouldn't exist without America,"" Zakaria said. ""This is really a struggle between the civilized world and a band of extremists. Even if you take the U.S. out of it ... the civilized world is up in arms."" And Jake Tapper, host of CNN's ""The Lead,"" said American leaders were conspicuously absent from historic Paris rally, perhaps the most important public demonstrations in Europe in the last generation. Tapper not only called out the President and his administration, but also prospective 2016 hopefuls from both parties, for missing the opportunity to share in the global moment. Obama spoke about the Paris attacks on Friday, saying he wants the people of France to know the United States ""stands with you today, stands with you tomorrow."" The White House also announced Sunday that it will host a February 18 summit aimed at countering violent extremism. Earnest said that event will ""highlight domestic and international efforts to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from radicalizing, recruiting or inspiring individuals or groups in the United States and abroad to commit acts of violence, efforts made even more imperative in light of recent, tragic attacks in Ottawa, Sydney and Paris."" He said the summit will include presentations, panel discussions and small group meetings, focused on the local, state and federal government levels.

"(CNN)North Korea lashed out at the United States on Sunday, calling a new set of recently levied economic sanctions repugnant and hostile. ""The policy persistently pursued by the U.S. to stifle (North Korea), groundlessly stirring up bad blood towards it would only harden its will and resolution,"" a statement attributed to North Korea's Foreign Ministry said. On Friday, the United States hit North Korea with the new sanctions after the FBI said North Korea was behind last month's computer hack at Sony. The White House said a new executive order targets leaders in North Korea's government, preventing them from accessing property and entering the United States. The isolated nuclear regime, which has denied involvement in the Sony hack, was already subject to a strict set of U.S. economic restrictions. The FBI has maintained North Korea was behind the broad computer breach at Sony, though some technology experts say others could be involved -- such as former employees of the studio. On Friday, officials said the new set of sanctions was further indication of their confidence in North Korea's culpability, and said that private tech firms aren't privy to the intelligence proving Pyongyang's guilt. Obama signed the executive order putting the new sanctions in place on the second-to-last day of his winter vacation in Hawaii. Before his vacation began in mid-December Obama said North Korea was responsible for the attack and the United States was preparing a response. The White House said Friday's announcement reflected the beginning of that response. RELATED: Obama says North Korea's hack not war, but 'cybervandalism' ""The order is not targeted at the people of North Korea, but rather is aimed at the government of North Korea and its activities that threaten the United States and others,"" Obama wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner. The country poses a ""continuing threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States,"" Obama wrote. Among the agencies targeted by the new sanctions Friday was the Reconnaissance General Bureau, an intelligence agency the United States said was responsible for ""major cyberoperations"" in North Korea. The new sanctions also target officials at North Korea's Mining Development Trading Corporation, which the United States says is responsible for the country's arms dealing and weapons export business. Seven officials who represent North Korea's arms dealing trade in Africa, Iran, Russia and Syria were designated by the U.S. Treasury as subject to the new economic sanctions. U.S. administration officials said the individuals targeted by Friday's sanctions are not thought to be responsible for the Sony hack. But in exposing their names and positions as North Korean arms dealers, the United States hopes to stymie their business prospects. U.S. officials said they didn't know whether the 10 North Korean officials listed by the Treasury Department held any assets in U.S. institutions. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the sanctions were meant to ""isolate key North Korean entities and disrupt the activities of close to a dozen critical North Korean operatives."" ""We will continue to use this broad and powerful tool to expose the activities of North Korean government officials and entities,"" Lew said. RELATED: North Korea lambasts U.S. over 'The Interview,' says Obama is the 'culprit' Speaking to CNN late last month, Obama said the United States would respond to the Sony hacking ""proportionately,"" without specifying what actions his government might take to punish Kim Jong Un's government. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Friday, ""Today's actions are the first aspect of our response."" That seemed to indicate the widespread Internet outages reported in North Korea last month were not a retaliatory response to the Sony hack, though administration officials would not confirm the blackout came at the hands of the United States. ""There are many possible explanations for (North Korea's) Internet outage, including the possibility that they had ended up doing it to themselves,"" one U.S. official said. CNN's Tina Burnside contributed to this report. Note: An earlier version of this story included a tweet from what was actually a parody account.  CNN regrets the error.","The U.S. announces new sanctions against North Korea .

"Hotels are working overtime to accommodate the needs of one of the fastest growing demographics in the travel industry: businesswomen. ""Women are nearing half of all business travelers, and they make up 85% of purchase choices in the household,"" says Carolyn Pearson, the founder of Maiden-Voyage.com, a website that connects female business travelers across the globe and rates femme-friendly hotel brands. ""A woman might choose a hotel for business travel and then, if she likes it, go back for a weekend stay, or book the room again with the family. Hotels are starting to realize that when it comes to travel decisions, women are really influential."" Pearson also trains hotels to look at their service from a female perspective, enabling them to tweak what they offer to appeal more to women. ""We take the entire hotel staff -- from concierge to food and beverage -- and really get them to see their hotel through a woman's eyes. We identify two things: how can they improve her experience, and how can they create more loyalty and value so that she's more likely to return,"" she explains. Maiden Voyage's rankings are based not simply on amenities but also on a hotel's discretion and safety. ""Does the receptionist announce the room numbers out loud?"" says Pearson. ""Are the rooms located next to the lifts?"" The Sofitel Le Grand Ducal, Luxembourg, for instance, receives high marks because of its low-risk location, 24/7 manned reception, on-site secure parking, room service delivered by female staff, as well as for its high-powered hair dryers and Hermes toiletries. Read more: Layovers become more pleasure than pain . ""There are differences between what men and women need,"" says Judi Brownell, professor and dean of students at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. ""Most women are more particular than their male counterparts. Both are concerned with safety and comfort but these things make more of a difference to women travelers. They want to feel that hotels have taken into consideration their needs as women, and so appreciate the small things that are done to make then feel recognized."" They Hyatt hotel group has spent the last 18 months surveying guests in 40 facilitated group discussions around the world on how they can improve their services. It was the largest guest listening exercise ever conducted by the brand, and it was made up completely of women. ""We've found that approximately 80% of all business travel decisions are made by females,"" notes Kristine Rose, Hyatt's vice president of brands. ""Whether it's a family trip, and mom is deciding what hotel to stay in, or it's a travel agent -- most of whom happen to be female. There's a rise of female travel globally, especially in China, where more and more women are traveling every day."" Based on the feedback, Hyatt rolled out a number of innovative amenities across all its brands (over 500 locations worldwide), including adding the dermatologist-approved KenetMD Skin Care line to their list of bath amenities. It also introduced the ""Hyatt Has It"" program whereby Hyatt hotels stock everything and anything a traveler might have forgotten to pack, from deodorant to humidifiers (and every color of nail polish under the sun). Guests can borrow these items free of charge, or purchase them at retail value. Though the initiative benefits all guests, regardless of gender, Rose says the program was inspired by the survey responses of their women travelers. ""When we talked to some women, they were very vocal about not being perfect all the time. They said, 'I forget things, I don't always want to worry about whether I packed shampoo or conditioner.'"" Read more: Economy class goes gourmet . This sort of catered service seems to have replaced the trend of ""female-only"" floors that surfaced in the hospitality industry last year. Some hotels maintain a single-sex block of rooms. The Georgian Court Hotel in Vancouver, for instance, has the Orchid Floor, a group of 18 rooms stocked with Aveda products, complimentary fashion magazines and the type of gadgets that supposedly speak to a woman's heart, such as curling irons and hair straighteners. Some hotels that originally instated single-sex units have since done away with them. Don Shula Hotel in Florida was one of the first hotels to introduce the concept back in 2006. Their Patrician Rooms had enlarged makeup mirrors, women's magazines and breast exam cards in the showers. During renovations last year, the hotel decided their occupancy was too low to justify their continuance. ""They served their purpose a few years back but simply lost their luster over time,"" admits Lisa Gory, the hotel's director of sales and marketing. Hyatt has also eschewed installing all-female floors. ""There's a difference between creating a tailored experience that meets their needs, and calling them out as a group of people who need special treatment. They actually consider that kind of offensive,"" says Rose.","Women make up nearly half of all business travelers .

"The new Web series ""An African City"" is fun, trendy and over the top. It's also breaking taboos, dismantling stereotypes and creating major buzz in the continent. Set in Ghana, the series focuses on five glamorous young women who've returned to Accra after living abroad for years. They navigate the chaotic world of love, adventure and careers -- all while trying to reconnect with their bustling capital in spiky heels and fabulous clothes. Fans describe it as  the African version of ""Sex and the City,""  a comparison that show creator Nicole Amarteifio readily welcomes. CNN caught up with Amarteifio to find out more about the series and what inspired the former expatriate to do it. And the story closely mirrors hers. Born in Ghana, her family  fled  to London in the 1980s to escape a coup. They later relocated to the United States, where she grew up before packing up her bags recently and returning home. ""I always dreamed of Ghana; Ghana was where I wanted to be,"" she says. ""Ghana had color, it had potential, it had opportunity."" CNN: How did the show come about? Nicole Amarteifio: I wanted something for African women, something for us and by us. I was tired of the sole narrative of the African woman being about poverty and disease. I wanted to see another narrative -- one of beauty, glamor and intelligence. I knew I had to do something about it.  I couldn't keep complaining about the problem. Why did you decide on this particular theme? After returning to Ghana from the United States, I was sitting in my living room watching re-runs of  ""Sex and the City,"" and that sparked a solution to the problem: ""An African City.""  I was first inspired by its model -- a Carrie, a Samantha, a Charlotte and, well, two Mirandas. Leading ladies being completely vulnerable and open in the discovery of themselves -- whether sensually or professionally. Women are raving about the fashion and makeup  ... Ghanaian designers graciously loaned us clothes to use during production. I wanted this show to be a platform for all creatives -- fashion designers, musicians, interior designers, painters, etc. African culture tends to be conservative, and sex conversations can be a taboo. But you went there ... Yes, African culture can be conservative. But you get enough African women in a room, and conservatism can easily give way to what is real, to what is intimate, to what is vulnerable. And I think as a continent we are ready to bring down the facade and just be real. For the sake of the next generation, there are too many societal issues that need to be addressed in a real and authentic way. Critics have said a lot of  African women can't relate to the show. Thoughts? Do we all have to be burned-out chemistry teachers with cancer to relate to ""Breaking Bad""?  Do we all have to be Italian-American mobsters living in New Jersey to relate to ""The Sopranos""?  In Ghana, my choices for film entertainment are limited. ""An African City"" is trying to be the answer to what is lacking in our film industry; it's trying to be of high production value while incorporating the stories of Ghanaians and others throughout Africa. Others have said the lives of the women in the show revolve around men ... Their lives do not revolve around men, but the show revolves around the part of their lives that does. However, if people really pay attention ...  there is a lot to learn. Episode six  touches on the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act while an upcoming episode nine brings up  training female cooperatives and fighting the IRS. The show focuses on a narrative rarely seen, even in Africa. Was that your goal? I wanted a TV show about modern, beautiful, educated African women -- sometimes doing unintelligent things or going through absurd situations -- but for comedic purposes. When it comes to the African woman, there is room for many stories. Stories that we --as Africans -- can take control of and share with the world. What about this show unifies all women, regardless of background? As women, we've all been in love. We are all looking for love. If you're a female CEO or a woman pounding yams in the village, you are trying to take stake of your love life. The love life you assumed you would have (because of societal/cultural ideals) versus the love life that realistically exists. But, for me, a key unifying factor is nearly every African woman wants the narrative on the African woman changed. This show is one of the many ways to do so. Why did you decide to go the YouTube way, instead of TV? I loved that I would not lose any creative control to a TV network. I wanted to push some boundaries and I didn't want any TV network telling me otherwise. Which brings me to the next question. Are you generating revenue from the show? You know, for me, it's not about the revenue. Season one was really about just doing something in regards to the narrative, even if I had to use my own savings to get that done. Best compliment you've received so far? There are women in Africa and throughout the African Diaspora who have written me to just say thank you, that they are not used to seeing themselves on the screen. They are grateful and I am honored. When mainstream media ignores you or constantly tells you that there is only one type of you, you feel invisible. ""An African City"" is about our visibility. Most misleading misunderstanding about the show? I wanted the show to start a conversation -- many conversations at that. The one conversation I would like to address is when people ask: ""Is this African?""  But, that's the thing -- what is African? Or, what is African ""enough""? In a world where you have African immigrants who are born and raised elsewhere, are they no longer African?  Who decides? Talk to the critics  ... what do you want them to know? I am aware of what they do not like about the show. But, I don't see those things as problems and they shouldn't either. This is our show -- the show for us as African women. We can all work together to make it better from episode to episode, from season to season. And to the fans: Thank you. Thanks for showing TV networks the kind of content that we are all thirsting for, and what we're all thirsting for is other narratives of the African woman.","Creator Nicole Amarteifio sets her story in Accra, Ghana .

"On a busy Friday morning in Manhattan, nine pedestrians suffered bullet or fragment wounds after police unleashed a hail of gunfire at a man wielding a .45 caliber pistol who had just killed a former co-worker. The officers unloaded 16 rounds in the shadow of the Empire State Building at a disgruntled former apparel designer, killing him after he engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said. Three passersby sustained direct gunshot wounds, while the remaining six were hit by fragments, according to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.  All injuries were caused by police, he said Saturday. One officer shot nine rounds and another shot seven. Police identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, who was apparently laid off from his job as a designer of women's accessories at Hazan Import Co. last year. Johnson, who served in the U.S. Coast Guard in the mid-1970s, had two rounds left in his pistol. It holds eight, Kelly said. Police identified the slain co-worker as Steven Ercolino, 41, who had apparently filed a prior complaint against his assailant, claiming that he thought Johnson would eventually try to kill him. Both men had filed harassment complaints against each other in April 2011, Kelly added. Ercolino was listed as a vice president of sales at Hazan Import Corp., according to his LinkedIn profile. ""It's not something that should happen to a loving person like that,"" said his brother, Paul. ""He's going to be so missed by everybody. He was a light of so many lives."" His longstanding dispute with the gunman ""apparently centered on the fact that Ercolino was not selling -- at least in Johnson's opinion -- as much of his product ... as he wanted him to,"" Kelly said. The suspect lost his job last year at Hazan ""as a result of downsizing"" but continued to return to the company regularly, engaging in ""a confrontation with Ercolino virtually every time he went back."" The violence erupted Friday morning just as visitors began to queue up to ascend the famous New York skyscraper in one of Manhattan's busiest neighborhoods. Six of the injured were treated and released at hospitals by Friday evening, while three others remained hospitalized, Kelly added. One of those wounded, Erica Solar, was on her way to get a cup of coffee at Dunkin' Donuts when a bullet tore through the back of her leg, her brother said. The Manhattan receptionist is being treated at the city's Bellevue Hospital. Experts: Empire State Building shooting won't keep tourists away . Others like Robert Asika, a 23-year-old city tour guide, were on their way to work and got caught in the crossfire. ""When I turned around, I saw a guy reach in his suit and he pulled out a gun,"" he told CNN affiliate WCBS-TV. ""I guess he shot at the police officer. And the police officer shot him. And one of them shot me in the arm, and I fell."" Witnesses recount chaotic, unsettling scene . Irene Timan recalled to CNN affiliate WABC how she was walking down West 33rd Street and chatting with Ercolino on Friday morning,  when she spotted Johnson. ""I was like, 'Oh my God, that's Jeff Johnson.' And I was like, 'He's going to kill him, he's going to kill him, I know he's going to kill him,'"" said Timan, who knew there was ""bad blood"" between Johnson and Ercolino but didn't know why. Then, as Ercolino was talking to Timan in mid-sentence, Johnson fired at him -- ""right next to me,"" she recalled. Kelly, the police commissioner, said that Johnson -- who was wearing a business suit and carrying a briefcase as he waited -- shot Ercolino once in the head and then in the torso. An emotional Timan said Saturday that she has been replaying the incident ""over and over in my mind. And I thought, 'Maybe you could have kicked the gun out of his hand and Steve would have only gotten shot once instead of five or six times.' ... I just ran, I didn't know what else to do."" Johnson then walked east, before eventually turning north. A construction worker was among those who dashed after the gunman after the initial gunshots. Eventually, the worker alerted two police officers in front of the Empire State Building that the suspect ""just killed a man around the corner,"" Kelly said. The police commissioner said the suspect pulled his gun out of his briefcase as the officers approached, pointing at them. The officers then fatally shot Johnson. A brief surveillance video released Friday night by police shows the man walking behind a large planter on a busy street. He appears to point something as two officers approach, coming to within a few feet of him. Then, as bystanders run in all directions, the man falls abruptly to the ground after apparently being shot. Witnesses said police shot Johnson at least three times. ""I heard the gunshots,"" said Anika Basu, who was on a bus near the building when the shooting happened. ""I looked toward the left and saw three people fall. ... The whole entire crosswalk emptied and people were running. When she heard the shots and saw people running, this time toward her, Timan said she feared Johnson was ""going on a shooting spree."" ""And I really thought he was coming back for me,"" she said. Police say Johnson used a semiautomatic handgun and was carrying extra ammunition in his briefcase. He purchased the weapon legally in 1991 in Florida but did not have a permit to carry it in New York City. The former Manhattan resident did not appear to have had a criminal record, but authorities were still checking, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. Johnson's neighbor, Gisela Casella, described him as a quiet animal lover whose death left her ""shocked."" ""He was the nicest guy. He must have snapped or something. I don't know,"" she said. His landlord, Guillermo Suarez, said he lived alone and that he'd seen Johnson leave the building around 8 a.m. in a suit. By around 9 a.m., the shootings had prompted local and federal authorities to close several streets around Fifth Avenue and West 34th Street, snarling traffic in the heart of Manhattan.

"After a shaky start, an extended cease-fire in Gaza appeared to be holding Thursday. Rocket fire from Gaza late Wednesday, near the end of the initial truce, and early Thursday, as the extension began, raised doubts about whether it would last. Israeli airstrikes in response to the rockets added to fears that fighting was ratcheting up again. But the exchange of fire was limited and didn't last long. Quiet returned to the skies over Gaza, aside from the familiar buzz of Israeli drones. By noon Thursday in Gaza City, many people had left U.N. shelters to visit the neighborhoods they had fled during the fighting, and traffic had once again filled the bustling streets. Israeli and Palestinian officials said they had accepted the five-day extension of the truce. The initial three-day cease-fire had expired at midnight. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev accused Hamas, the militant Islamic group that holds power in Gaza, of violating the truce with the overnight rocket fire. But Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri had earlier denied that the organization had anything to do with firing any rockets toward Israel, leaving it unclear which Palestinian group had launched them. 'Still sticking points' Israeli and Palestinian delegations had been negotiating in Cairo through Egyptian go-betweens in an attempt to find a more lasting end to hostilities. Under the cease-fire extension, they are expected to return to the indirect talks over the weekend. ""There remains a positive atmosphere towards reaching a comprehensive agreement,"" Azzam al-Ahmed, the lead Palestinian negotiator told reporters late Wednesday. ""But there are still sticking points."" Khalil al-Hayya, a leader of Hamas, described the negotiations as both difficult and serious. He accused Israel of ""playing semantic games."" ""Since we are determined (to work things out), we agreed to extend the humanitarian truce in order to hold more in-depth consultations -- and to allow more pressure on the Israelis, internally and externally, so they agree with our demands,"" the Hamas leader said. The two sides' demands aren't easy to reconcile. Israel says it wants Hamas to disarm and Gaza to be demilitarized. The Palestinian delegation in Egypt, which includes Hamas, has demanded an end to Israel's economic blockade on Gaza, an extension of fishing rights off the coast, the reopening of an airport and seaport and the release of prisoners held by Israelis. Al-Ahmed, head of the Palestinian team, said late Wednesday that there's still no agreement on the opening of crossings into Israel, ""the launching of a free fishing zone"" and various ""security issues."" Israel: Hamas is 'wild card' The Gaza conflict has killed more than 1,900 people on the Palestinian side, most of them believed to be civilians, and 67 on the Israeli side, most of them soldiers. Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system has intercepted some of the roughly 3,500 rockets fired from Gaza since the conflict began. Regev told CNN on Thursday that the key to a longer-term solution was an end to rocket fire from Gaza. ""If there's no hostile fire from Gaza into Israel, of course we can have serious discussions about easing restrictions,"" he said. They're only there in the first place as a response to the violence."" Hamas is the ""wild card,"" Regev said, expressing skepticism that the group would give up violence. But Hanan Ashrawi, an executive member of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the Israelis ""keep blaming Hamas for everything."" She suggested that the Israeli government ""stop trying to demonize, dehumanize and blame Hamas and the Palestinians,"" saying it should instead ""make the cease-fire hold and move to ending the occupation and dealing with all the root causes.""

"On a dusty, remote ranch across the Rio Grande from this Texas border town, an intimidating drug lord stood over 13-year-old Rosalio Reta and handed him a gun. Reta didn't know who the man was, but it was clear he instilled fear and commanded respect among everyone standing around watching the dramatic scene unfold. The American teen had never before met anyone who carried a pistol adorned with such an unforgettable decoration: the number ""40"" encrusted in diamonds on the handle. The cartel leader looked at Reta and ordered him to shoot and kill a man tied up on the ground. If he refused to murder the stranger, Reta recalls, the drug lord would have killed him. Rosalio Reta's career as a teen drug cartel assassin had begun. ""I knew that my life had just changed forever,"" Reta told CNN this week, 11 years later. ""That's a day that I'm never going to be able to forget. After that, I didn't have no life."" Reta's boyhood friend Gabriel Cardona says he started his life as a criminal by stealing cars and selling them across the border in Mexico. He graduated to smuggling drugs and weapons across the Rio Grande. Cardona says it wasn't long before he also became a drug cartel assassin. He was only 16. Reta and Cardona agreed to give CNN rare interviews from the Texas prisons where both men are serving life sentences for murder. They offered a first-hand glimpse inside the sinister world of drug cartels, a world that plagues innocent people on both sides of the border. The mysterious drug lord who ordered Reta to shoot the stranger at the ranch that day, Reta says, was Miguel Angel Trevino. For years, Trevino was the unrivaled leader of the ruthless Zetas drug cartel until police arrested him last month just outside Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Trevino, 40, faces charges of organized crime, homicide, torture and money laundering, a Mexican government security spokesman told reporters in July. There were at least seven warrants for his arrest. Many Zeta leaders often use numbers as their cartel nicknames. On the streets of Mexico, Trevino was known as ""Z-40."" One of the most feared and powerful drug kingpins in the world, Trevino took drug cartel brutality to never-before-seen levels. Mexican and United States law enforcement agencies accuse Trevino of killing hundreds of people while laundering hundreds of millions of dollars. Although Z-40 virtually ruled northern Mexico without fear, as Reta came to know him he began to see Trevino as a regular guy. Reta watched others respond to Trevino's tough leadership. Trevino had built control and protection systems to insulate his organization at every level from law enforcement agencies and politicians. To make a point, sometimes Trevino sent messages along with decapitated corpses of rival cartel members, said Reta. ""Absolute control,"" Reta said of Trevino's power. ""In a gun battle, in a confrontation, he's the first one to get out of his truck and lead his people. He's not going to ask people to do something that he's not willing to do himself. That's why a lot of people follow him."" Entering the narco world 'lifestyle' Reta, 24, and Cardona, 26, still bear signs of their years as feared assassins. Reta has bizarre markings around his eyes; Cardona has drawings of eyeballs tattooed on his eyelids. A large image of ""Santa Muerte""  -- or Saint of Death -- marks Cardona's back. Denounced by Mexico's Catholic Church, Santa Muerte is a popular symbol among drug traffickers. CNN was first to broadcast the police interrogation videos from which the world first learned about Reta and Cardona, sparking worldwide fascination with both men and making them infamous legends of a narco world. Cardona and Reta grew up on Lincoln Street in Laredo, just a few blocks from the city's largest border crossing checkpoint. Over the years the ramshackle neighborhood has developed into a discarded border region where homes sit on dilapidated foundations and families live under crumbling rooftops. Reta was one of 10 children and Cardona was one of five boys whose father disappeared early in his life. ""On the border, a lot of people get dragged into this lifestyle,"" Reta said. ""But what we fail to see is that we do it to ourselves."" Reta was a young boy headed down the wrong path. He had followed two friends to the ranch across the border where he was ordered to kill for the first time. The friends were mingling with questionable characters but he was ""curious"" about the narco world. When Reta arrived at the ranch, it was a crash course in drug cartel culture. ""They were torturing people and getting information from them,"" said Reta. ""I couldn't believe what I was seeing. People getting tortured, killed, decapitated.  It was kind of hard to believe."" Cardona was also making a name for himself at that time, and impressing the same narco leaders. If eyes are a window into the soul then unraveling the myth of Gabriel Cardona gets complicated. And like everything in the violent world of drug cartels, unraveling truth and myth seems fleeting. On the surface, Gabriel Cardona's eyes belong to a baby face. If you know nothing about him, it's hard to imagine he could have been a lethal assassin. But then there are those eyes tattooed on his eyelids. When you see those, they seem like the window into the cold, calculated soul that made Cardona a notoriously effective killer for the Zetas. Cardona smiled when asked how many people he remembers killing for the Zetas. ""I have no idea,"" Cardona said. ""It's a violent world."" After some prodding, Cardona estimates he probably killed close to 30 people in less than two years. Cardona and Reta say they were paid thousands of dollars a week just to be available -- ready at all times to answer the call to kill. When orders from cartel leaders came, the men would begin hunting their prey. Opinion: Horror won't end with cartel leader's arrest . It's hard to pinpoint just how much money they were paid. Cardona claims he was spending more than $10,000 a week. The men say cartel leaders provided them with a house and extravagant cars. Cardona was often seen driving around town in a Mercedes. For each ordered hit, they said, they were paid an extra fee -- about $10,000, and sometimes even more depending on the importance of the targeted victim. The money and lifestyle were so seductive and intoxicating that both teenagers dropped out of school and started living the high-rolling, lavish lifestyle. Reta dropped out sixth grade; Cardona left school in ninth grade. ""It gives you that sense that you could do anything without being touched and having that sense of power,"" Cardona said. ""You think that it's not going to end because it just keeps coming."" In interrogation videos made shortly after his arrest in 2009, Reta told a Laredo police detective how killing made him feel like ""Superman."" Related: U.S. teens were hit men for Mexican cartel . The job of a cartel assassin isn't one most people grow old and retire from. They either end up in prison, or it's likely their tortured corpse will be left along a blood-soaked path to nowhere in the Mexican countryside. Cardona and Reta didn't last long in that world. They each say they lived the life for about three years, Cardona from age 16 to 19; Reta, from age 13 to 16. Eventually Laredo police detectives zeroed in on the teen assassins. Cardona was arrested and pleaded guilty to killing seven men and to conspiracy to kidnap and kill in a foreign country. He was sentenced to more than 80 years in prison. Reta said he began to fear that rival cartel members were getting close to killing him as retribution, so while working on an assignment in Monterrey, Mexico, he called a contact at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and surrendered. Reta pleaded guilty to two murders and was handed two prison sentences, of 30 and 40 years. ""I've come to regret everything I've done,"" Reta said. ""I couldn't take it anymore. It was real hard for me. I wasn't living my life."" For his part, Cardona is not as remorseful. He doesn't spend a lot of time thinking about the violence he wielded, he said. His mind isn't haunted by violent images from his former life. ""I'm really a good person,"" he said. ""It just happened."" ""I always had thought that if I die, it's going to be by a bullet in the head,"" he said. ""I never thought that I was going to die in prison.""","Two men reveal details about their lives as teen drug cartel assassins .

"Another year of Emmy Award nominations, another year of ""They forgot who?!"" Though the Emmys are commonly known as the arbiter of excellence in television, with so many good shows on the air right now, they inevitably also become the leader of the snubs. What TV favorites had fans shouting at their screens after being left in the dark? Take a look: . Clone Club for the win. It seemed like a no-brainer. Last year's omission of Tatiana Maslany, the uber-talented lead actress from BBC America's sci-fi hit ""Orphan Black,"" left fans in fits of rage. The self-proclaimed Clone Club -- named after the actress' multiple clone characters -- did everything short of picketing the red carpet. Now, that she has been left out a second time, all bets are off. ""NO TATIANA. GET YOUR PITCHFORKS OUT NOW,"" one enraged fan tweeted. ""At least I have today off work to mourn Tatiana Maslany's Emmys snub in the privacy of my own home,"" another clone-clubber tweeted. Fans were so affected by the snub that #EmmyForMaslany was a trending topic on Twitter for much of Thursday morning. For those who watch the show, this outrage shouldn't be too much of a surprise. The actress impressively portrays more than six characters, and sometimes, all of those characters appear in the same scene. Sure, stand-ins and special effects offer a bit of assistance, but Maslany inhabits her characters so fully, it's easy to forget there aren't different actresses on screen. From reckless Sarah Manning to neurotic soccer mom Alison Hendrix, all the way to free-spirited scientist Cosima Niehaus, Maslany seamlessly jumps from one to the next. Who could forget that incredible dance scene in the Season 2 finale featuring four clones? ""How does the academy snub Tatiana Maslany for lead actress in a drama? She plays 6 characters!"" fellow actress Wendi McLendon-Covey tweeted. Fans shouldn't get too upset, though; Maslany is a back-to-back Critic's Choice Award winner for her portrayal of the duplicates. And hey, there's always season 3 (thank you, BBC America, for the much-needed renewal)! 'The Walking Dead': Alive in the ratings, still dead to the Emmys. In just four seasons, AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" has gone from ""that gory graphic novel show"" to the highest-rated cable program in history. But for some reason, this zombie apocalyptic drama is not a hit with the Emmys. It scored no nods in any of the major categories (though, to be fair, it did get one for editing and another for special effects). ""Oh look, Walking Dead got snubbed at the Emmys again..."" one disappointed fan lamented. ""Yet again The Walking Dead gets snubbed at the Emmys despite having some of the best writing and acting I've seen on tv. Lame,"" another ranted. And not for nothing, but how could they leave off the magnificent Melissa McBride in the supporting actress category? Starting as a scared and battered wife and mother, McBride has taken the character to one of the toughest women in television. Lena Dunham steals Mindy Kaling's thunder. Lena and Mindy: Two incredible actresses and comedians who have created, written and starred in their own shows, but one has just been snubbed by the Emmys. While writer/actress/director Lena Dunham is constantly recognized for her gritty and dark HBO comedy ""Girls,"" Mindy Kaling's much brighter Fox comedy about a single doctor struggling to find love is all but forgotten. Even more awkward? Along with Carson Daly, Kaling was announcing the nominations Thursday morning! ""Endless props to Mindy Kaling, who had to keep reading the TelePrompTer even after her snub,"" Vulture wrote on Twitter. ""Mindy Kaling robbed again by the Emmys. Can we just start our own campaign to award her queen of everything?"" tweeted one Kaling supporter. So what gives, Emmys? ""The Mindy Project"" is not only funny, Kaling is irresistibly adorable as the quirky lead. You also can't forget actor Chris Messina, who has helped mold the cliched love interest into the loveable Danny, now everyone's work crush. Shamelessly snubbing 'Shameless.' Yes, excellent lead actor William H. Macy did get a nomination, but the show received no other nods, a serious oversight. In its fourth season, the dark Showtime comedy was at its absolute best. Although the quality of many shows drops as the series progresses, ""Shameless"" has only gotten better. The Gallaghers are like family at this point, albeit the most dysfunctional one around. And where do we begin with the absence of lead actress Emmy Rossum for her portrayal of the family matriarch who manages to sometimes be a bigger wreck than her much-younger siblings? How could voters forget her when she has the same name as the awards show? ""Ew at that Emmy Rossum snub Emmys. Ew. Ugh. I hate you so much right now,"" a disgruntled fan tweeted. 'Americans' hustle. While FX's ""Fargo"" received plenty of love at this year's nominations, its sophomore drama, ""The Americans,"" was not as lucky. This espionage thriller not only keeps fans constantly guessing at what is coming next, it manages to make us fall in love with Soviet spies who are out to get America. It is possible that Showtime's perennial favorite ""Homeland"" stole all the attention from ""The Americans,"" but anyone who has seen both knows they are vastly different. And don't get fans started on the lack of a Keri Russell nomination for lead actress. Her performance is enough to make some Americans want to turn traitor just to partner up with her. ""The Emmys are anti-Americans,"" New York Daily News columnist Bill Hammond cleverly tweeted. Amy Poehler gets a nom, but her shows find no love. Yes, fans can rejoice; Amy Poehler nabbed a nomination for lead actress for her portrayal of politician Leslie Knope on NBC's ""Parks and Recreation."" Now, the trick will be for her to win, which hasn't happened with her previous nods. Unfortunately, her two shows were missing from the comedy series category: ""Parks"" is the most obvious miss, with a crackling cast that matches the chemistry of ""The Office"" mixed with the political satire of HBO's ""Veep"" -- both of which have been Emmy favorites. But the lesser-known snub would be Comedy Central's ""Broad City,"" of which Poehler is executive producer. ""Broad City"" follows two women in their 20s living in New York, and the rest is just too crazy to even explain. It's only one season in, and the hilarity that ensues between actresses Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson (who also created the show) is both bitingly smart and LOL-funny. ""It's a joke Broad City didn't get nominated for an Emmy. Funniest show on TV,"" a fan tweeted after the announcement. You can root for your favorites that were actually nominated (or shout at the screen in protest for those who were not) when the 2014 Emmy Awards air live on NBC at 8 p.m. ET August 25.

"Indian police are on the lookout for three Iranians they suspect of involvement in last month's bombing of an Israeli Embassy car in New Delhi, a senior investigator said Thursday. The investigator, who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity, identified the suspects as Houshan Afshar, Syed Ali Mehdi Sadr and Mohammad Reza Abolghasemi. The Iranian Embassy spokesman, Hassan Rahimi Majd, did not respond to CNN's calls for a comment. Syed Mohammad Kazmi, an Indian freelance journalist working for an Iranian news outlet, was arrested last week in connection with the February 13 attack, which left several people wounded. In a separate incident on February 13, another device was found on an Israeli Embassy car in Tbilisi, Georgia, and safely detonated. A day later, a series of bombs disguised as radios detonated in Bangkok, Thailand. The Bangkok blasts did not kill anyone, and their intended targets were not clear, although authorities have said they were intended for Israeli diplomats. The devices used explosive materials that are not available in Thailand and were likely smuggled in, police said. The first bomb went off in a rental house in Bangkok believed to have been leased to foreigners, according to Thai authorities. After the blast, two of the men left the scene, while a third detonated two more bombs -- one when a taxi driver refused to give him a ride and another when he tried to throw a bomb at police officers as they closed in on him. The last bomb exploded near the man, blowing off his legs below the knee, authorities said. Thai police released a photo of a radio set packed with explosives. The devices included C-4 class plastic explosives, steel balls to increase destructive power, and round magnets. Police said the bombs had a five-second delay to allow the bomber to escape. The Thai National Security Council has drawn a tentative link between the bombs in Bangkok and those in India and Georgia, saying the materials used in the devices were similar. Kazmi, the freelance journalist, was held on charges of plotting the New Delhi attack. Authorities did not say for which Iranian media organization he works. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Tehran for the attacks. But Iran has denied the accusation, saying that ""Israeli agents are often the perpetrators of such terrorist acts."" Three other Iranians are in custody. Allegations that Iran was involved in the attacks ""are fabricated and false and are prepared by the U.S. and the Zionist regimes,"" the official Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency, quoting a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said last month.","Indian police are looking for three Iranian suspects in last month's bombing in New Delhi .

"While traditionally hotels offering ""day rates"" conjure up seedy, by-the-hour hovels reserved exclusively for illicit trysts, the last couple of years have seen a rash of upmarket accommodations adopting the practice. According to many in the hospitality industry, day-rate rooms are more likely to be used for business and tourism purposes than they are romantic ones. Just behind world-famous department store Harrods sits one of London's most exclusive hotels. The Beaufort may be the only accommodation in the city with unlimited complimentary cream tea and an open bar (guests can guzzle all the champagne they can muster, free of charge). It can afford these amenities because the room rates start at £170 ($270) per night. ""The Beaufort is actually a very exclusive boutique hotel,"" explains Nassar Khalil, the director of sales and marketing. ""We cater to a unique set of people because our price bracket is such. It's not just for any Jack and Jill."" And it's not the type of place you'd expect would offer discounted day rates. Yet it is one of hundreds of high-end hotels that have started doing so in the last year. Khalil reckons that since implementing these mini-stays, The Beaufort has seen a 10% increase in occupancy. ""Most of the time, it's for business guests,"" says Khalil. ""Many of them might have an early meeting, and they want a place to get themselves ready and have a shower. ""Others have a late flight, and they want some place to leave their bag, and maybe have a drink at the bar or have some tea before heading to the airport."" See also: Airports' tiniest sleep spaces . The boutique Town Hall Hotel, also in London, has also seen an increase in its revenue after partnering with dayuse-hotels.com, an online reservation service that lists day rates offered by high-end hotels. Michael Benjamins, the senior sales manager at the Town Hall Hotel, estimates that in the year since they started taking day bookings they've generated an extra £10,000 ($15,880) in revenue. ""Usually, between 11am and 5pm our guestrooms are empty,"" explains Benjamins. ""Now, if we have one guest that wants to come for the day, and another who has a late check-in, we can use that room twice,"" he adds. If the hotel was situated closer to an airport, Benjamins reckons that the hotel's revenue would be substantially higher due to the demand from business travelers. Dayuse-hotels.com was the brainchild of David Lebée and Thibaud d'Agrèves, both of whom worked at the Hotel L'Amour in Paris. The hotel is particularly popular with touring artists and musicians. Often, the guests would ask about renting a room for a few hours, just for a place to relax before a performance. Lebée and d'Agrèves recognised that there was a gap in the market, and the idea for dayuse-hotels was born. Though originally it was strictly a Parisian company, dayuse-hotels.com has since become global, and today is partnered with 350 hotels in nine different countries, including the four-star Flatiron Hotel in New York, and the designer Hotel the Gray in Milan. While d'Agrèves purports that many of the site's users are indeed interested in the rooms for business reasons, the layout of the homepage says otherwise. Categories at the bottom include ""affair,"" ""infidelity,"" ""cheating,"" ""love hotel,"" and -- for the narcoleptic -- ""nap."" ""In Paris, it is more used for romantic reasons,"" admits d'Agrèves. ""It's just a much more touristic city; people don't visit Paris for business. ""In London and New York, it's different. Because our economy is so terrible, you'll see French businessmen coming to London for the day just to open a bank account. They need a room just for chilling, a rest, and a quick nap. Then they take the train back to Paris."" D'Agrèves sees the trend expanding, especially as dayuse-hotels.com is working on rolling out themed packages designed to pull in a more specialised clientele. Examples include fitness- or gastronomy-themed bundles that will lure in foodies and health gurus, and could ultimately transform the way day rates are perceived. Benjamins notes that while day rates have become more mainstream, they are not new to the luxury hotel market. ""There's always been a demand for it, but hotels have kept it really quiet,"" he notes. He's delighted that dayuse-hotels.com has created a platform for high-end day rates. ""It's given us an incremental revenue we would not have otherwise have,"" he says. ""You can't say no to that, especially in this economy.""","Top hotels such as The Beaufort in London have started offering rooms for a few hours .

"Deep inside Jwaneng, the world's richest diamond mine in southern Botswana, Tshepo Kgomokhumo drives his massive truck through piles of rocks forming a lunar-like landscape. His job is to ferry away ton after ton of unwanted rocks while a small army of bulldozers near him tears into the earth's crust in search of the precious stones. ""I'm a soldier for my country,"" Kgomokhumo says. For him, as well as many others in this small, arid country, diamonds are a source of both income and pride. The economy of Botswana, a landlocked country in southern Africa, has been transformed by diamonds. Since their discovery in late 1960s, the development of the country has been built on the gems buried deep in its soil. In 1969, the Botswana government signed a 50/50 deal with global diamond giant De Beers to explore and mine all of the country's diamonds. The partnership, called 'Debswana,' has helped turn Botswana  into one of Africa's most prosperous countries, boasting today a robust economy and one of the highest per capita incomes on the continent. The state mines the country's riches as an owner, getting a share of the profit in addition to just collecting taxes and royalties like many other mineral-rich African governments. This unique arrangement has allowed Botswana to make significant investments in education and health care, officials say. ""Since we partnered with De Beers, we have a lot to show from any community development standpoint,"" says Bank of Botswana governor Linah Mohohlo. She notes that this model can be emulated in other parts of the continent. ""If you were to replicate what we do in Botswana in other African countries, I have no doubt in my mind that there could be meaningful gains."" Watch: Inside Zimbabwe's diamond industry . And now, Botswana's diamond industry looks set to get a further boost after De Beers announced last year its decision to shift its rough diamond trading operation from London to Gaborone, the Botswana capital. The company says it expects the move to bring an extra $6 billion of diamond sales into the country. A new head office is also under construction while 80 staff members will be relocated from Europe to Africa. Watch: High-tech scanning machines safeguard diamonds . Kago Mmopi, of the Diamond Trading Corporation, says the sales agreement will set up Botswana as one of the world's key diamond centers. ""These diamonds are basically your top-of-the-range kind of diamonds,"" he says. ""These are gem diamonds, they will certainly go for jewelry."" Read more: Botswana's fearless legal eagle fights male bias . Those close to the deal say the impact of the De Beers move will be felt in many other ways too. Some international banks, which finance the diamond industry, have applied for banking licenses, says the government. Mohohlo notes that that extra $6 billion flowing through the country's banking system is the ""most significant"" offshoot of the deal. ""I was engaged in those negotiations and they were hard, long and daunting,"" she says. ""When you have partners, you can't always agree. But it is important that ultimately we agreed on what we believe serves both interests."" Officials also hope that more people in the country will now be trained and employed in the diamond industry -- 'Debswana' is already  Botswana's biggest  private employer. It is also expected that a growing number of companies will seek to set up shop in the country to have direct access to its rough gems. Yet, authorities are quick to point out that the country cannot rely solely on the precious stones, especially as diamond sales have been hard-hit in recent times amid the financial crisis. Read more: Botswana's heavy metal heads . ""That is obviously a worrying phenomenon,"" says says Ponatshego Kedikilwe, the country's minerals minister. ""The dependence on diamonds only has been given us sleepless nights, whether it's in terms of revenue, foreign exchange or taxes and the budget."" Mohohlo adds that the government is aware that diamonds are exhaustible and non-renewable. ""Therefore we have to continue to ensure that the benefits deriving from them are there for everybody to see,"" she says. For now, though, Botswana's economic future is linked to the precious stones still buried in the soil. The diamonds allure is enduring as people still consume them faster than they are being mined. And a growing gap between supply and demand will, for now, keep prices high.","De Beers is moving its rough diamond trading operation to Botswana .

The 50-year-old pop star had filed a petition to adopt a girl, Chifundo James, 4, whose first name translates to mercy in Chichewa, the country's national language. She has three other children, including a son she adopted from the southern African nation in 2006.  Watch more about the court's refusal » . The rejection follows weeks of criticism by human rights activists, who said Madonna was using her fame to circumvent a residency requirement for foreigners adopting in the country. Do you agree with the decision? A coalition of local nonprofits from across the country accused Madonna on Thursday of taking advantage of a weakness in the country's child protection system. Days earlier, the charity Save the Children UK had urged the American singer to rethink the adoption and let the child be raised by her relatives. Local media have reported that the child's teenage mother died days after she gave birth to her. ""This is a triumph for the children of Malawi,"" said Mavuto Bamusi, the national coordinator of Malawi Human Rights Consultative Committee. ""Inter-country adoption is not the best way of providing protection to children ... they should grow up in familiar cultural and religious surroundings,"" Bamusi said, adding that ""supporting children from outside our country only helps five of the 1.5 million orphans we have."" Despite the controversies, a majority of Malawians were rooting for the adoption. Marilyn Segula, a presenter at Capital FM, which broadcasts in at least five cities, including the capital, Lilongwe said Thursday that 99 percent of callers wanted the adoption to be approved. ""People are saying: 'Why are these [non-governmental organizations] pretending to care now? If anyone wanted to amend the law, they should have done it with other adoptions.' "" The recently divorced singer was married to British filmmaker Guy Ritchie. She has been involved with Malawi for several years and made a documentary, ""I Am Because We Are,"" to highlight poverty, AIDS and other diseases devastating children in that country. She also co-founded a nonprofit group, Raising Malawi, which provides programs to help the needy.","Official: The decision came down to residency requirement .

"In the second part of a long-ranging interview, al Qaeda's leader urged Muslims to capture Westerners as pawns that might be used to free prisoners aligned with his movement. Asked what he'd tell ""Muslims and the mujahedeen"" -- a term used for some Islamist militants -- to do to ""fulfill their duty"" toward their allies in custody, Ayman al-Zawahiri said, ""I advise them to capture Westerners -- and especially the Americans, as much as they can -- to exchange them for our captives."" This was one of many comments on a wide array of topics that al-Zawahiri touched on in a question-and-answer session with al Qaeda's media arm, audio of which was published on the radical Islamist website Hanein. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the recording, though the voice appears very similar to previous messages from al-Zawahiri. In the first part of the interview, which was posted online a week ago, al-Zawahiri insisted that al Qaeda is holding strong and, in fact, ""expanding"" 13 years after the United States launched its ""war on terror"" following the September 11, 2001, attacks. ""The upper hand is for the one who does not withdraw from his land,"" he said. ""Who has withdrawn from Iraq, and who has not? Who has withdrawn from Afghanistan and who has not?"" The second part of the interview was apparently published last Saturday. CNN learned about this part of the exchange via the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terror-related websites. In it, al-Zawahiri expresses solidarity with the Muslim Brotherhood in its struggle with Egypt's military-led government. Voters elected that Islamist group's candidate, Mohammed Morsy, as president -- a decision the al Qaeda leader said ""the West, led by America,"" did not respect. Since then, the Cairo government has banned the Brotherhood and detained many of its leaders, including the now-ousted Morsy. Al-Zawahiri said the Islamist group has ""all the right to use force against the injustice they are facing."" ""The secularists and the army attacked them with Gulf money, American planning, Israeli incitement and crusader plotting,"" he added. Al-Zawahiri also discussed Yemen, where the United States and its allies have been working with the Sana'a-based government to go after members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. A combination of ground assaults and airstrikes -- including by suspected U.S. drones -- April 19-21 killed more than 60 suspected al Qaeda militants, Yemeni officials have said. No reference was made to that operation in al-Zawahiri's interview posted to Hanein. In fact, it's not known exactly when he may have conducted the interview. Some in Yemen affiliated with ""the Islamist movements"" have ""conspired"" with that Arab nation's government ""by participating or remaining silent to the American presence and its repetitive aggression against the Yemeni people,"" al-Zawahiri said. It's a position they'll ultimate regret, he surmised. The al Qaeda leader predicted, ""It is the mujahedeen and the people of ardency from among the Yemeni people and its scholars, its true-born and its chiefs and their sheikhs (who will prevail).""","Al Qaeda's Ayman al-Zawahiri purportedly answers questions on range of subjects .

"The Egyptian prosecutor's office says evidence shows three suspects linked to al Qaeda targeted the U.S. and French embassies in Cairo, as well as an Egyptian army facility in the Sinai Peninsula, according to state news. The state-run Middle East News Agency, known as MENA, reported Wednesday that state prosecutors have evidence suggesting the alleged terrorists, who were arrested over the weekend, planned to detonate car bombs at the three sites. A source briefed by an Egyptian security official said Wednesday that he'd been told that France's embassy was allegedly targeted but was not told about the other diplomatic mission. Members of the alleged terrorist cell had 10 kilograms of ammonium nitrate, which is commonly used in bomb making, according to the source. Mubarak's retrial starts amid tight security . David Linfield, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, told CNN that he's aware of reports in Egyptian media that the American embassy was targeted but otherwise had no comment on the matter. And an Egyptian Interior Ministry spokesman refused to comment to CNN about the alleged targets. A prosecutor ordered one of those arrested, Mohamed AboulEla Aqida, to stay behind bars for at least 15 more days, rather than be put on house arrest, MENA reported Wednesday. The fate of the other two people detained was not immediately clear. The prosecutor's office pointed to new evidence that has surfaced linking Aqida to a leading figure of al Qaeda in Iraq named Daoud Al Asdi, as well as al Qaeda members in the Sinai Peninsula, according to MENA. He and others allegedly had gone beyond the planning stages and were getting ready to attack when Egyptian police arrested them, the source briefed by an Egyptian security official told CNN. A U.S. State Department travel alert issued Wednesday did not specifically mention this plot, though it did allude to a May 9 knife attack on a U.S. citizen. That American was outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, was asked if he was an American, then attacked. Egyptian police have a suspect in custody in that case, according to the State Department. The diplomatic alert also urged Americans ""to avoid all demonstrations in Egypt, as even peaceful ones can quickly become violent, and a foreigner could become a target of harassment or worse.""","Citing prosecutors, state news says those arrested targeted U.S., French embassies .

"It's a region of crises next door. A brutal civil war in Syria has spawned an equally, if not more, ruthless crusade in Iraq. Libya is at risk of becoming a failed state. And even Israel -- a relative oasis of calm -- is in the midst of a campaign in Gaza, where people are being killed nearly every day. What's going on? A casual observer could be forgiven for being lost. The region, rich in history, is as complex as it can be confusing. With so many conflicts, on so many fronts, here's a quick look at what's happening: . Iraq . Who's fighting? The Iraqi government and security forces are battling ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Since spilling into Iraq from Syria, the group has captured city after city, including the country's second-largest city, Mosul. The United States is supporting the Iraqi military in its effort, by bombing ISIS positions and making humanitarian airdrops. Why? ISIS is clear about what it wants: To create a caliphate, or Islamic state, spanning Iraq and Syria. Its Sunni Muslim fighters have been targeting Iraq's Christians and other minority groups, as well as Shiite Muslims. ""Those people are not people; they are monsters,"" said a student, 22, who spoke to CNN in the Iraqi city of Irbil, after fleeing his home. ""Not monsters; monsters are better."" What's the latest? The situation on the ground is in constant flux. U.S. airstrikes are ongoing. More than two years after President Barack Obama brought home forces from the country, officials have ruled out getting involved in a combat role. But, ""when we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye,"" the President said. Will anyone stop ISIS? Syria . Who's fighting? What started as a popular protest against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has swelled into a civil war of more than three years and counting. The armed opposition is made up of various groups, including the Free Syrian Army. The government says it is fighting terrorists. Why? Rebels want an end to the rule of al-Assad, whose government is determined to keep power. The United Nations says more than 150,000 people have been killed in the past three years. ""No one is winning; no one can win,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. ""Even if one side were to prevail in the short term, the devastating toll will have sown the seeds of future conflict."" What's the latest? ISIS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, is using the opportunity of war to carve a swath of territory deep inside Syria. It has consolidated control over several towns along the Euphrates River in the east. ""ISIL is no longer simply a terrorist organization. It is now a full-blown army,"" said Brett McGurk, with the U.S. State Department. Terror havens in Syria and Iraq: Five reasons the West should worry . Israel and Gaza . Who's fighting? Israel is faced off against the Palestinian side, which includes Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Counties in the region, and outside, also have a stake in the outcome. Egypt is attempting to help broker a peace, with the United States playing a supporting role in talks. ""It's a proxy war for control or dominance in the Middle East,"" said CNN's Fareed Zakaria. Why? Israel is calling for Hamas, the militant Islamic group that runs Gaza, to disarm. Hamas, meanwhile, wants an end to the Israeli blockade of Gaza, a measure Israel says is necessary to stop weapons being smuggled in. It's a decades-old conflict, with potentially new complications. Gaza: Why it's different this time . What's the latest? A brief period of calm was shattered Friday. The Israeli military said it carried out strikes on militant targets in Gaza in response to a barrage of rocket fire after a three-day truce came to an end without a longer-term agreement. Renewed hostilities mean more misery for the people of Gaza. Close to 1,900 people have been killed there so far, including hundreds of children, according to Palestinian health authorities. The United Nations estimates at least 70% of the dead were civilians. Israeli officials have said 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel died. Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepts many of the rockets fired at populated areas of the country. What is Hamas' endgame in Gaza? What is Israel's endgame in Gaza? Libya . Who's fighting? Nearly three years after Libyan rebels overthrew a longtime dictator, the country is no closer to a lasting peace. In fact, the fighting is the worst it has been since the revolution. The civil war that culminated in Moammar Gadhafi's 2011 death has given way to warring militias, which outnumber and outgun the country's security forces. Why? The overthrow of Gadhafi created a power vacuum. Many inside Libya are desperate to get out while others are moving in to take advantage of the increased instability. ""These people do not recognize borders. For them, if there's an opportunity for them to act, they act,"" Libyan Foreign Minister Mohamed Abdelaziz said about extremists. ""And we should not give the opportunity to them."" What's the latest? Witnesses reported heavy shelling and fighting last month around the international airport in Tripoli, which has been under attack by an alliance of powerful militias from the city of Misrata and Islamist groups. The fighters are trying to take the airport from militias from the city of Zintan, which have controlled it since the 2011 revolution. With Tripoli under siege, Libya's newly elected parliament met in far-away Tobruk. It called for an immediate cease-fire under U.N. supervision. ""I must really underline the fact that all the factors at the moment are leading in the direction of a failed state,"" Abdelaziz said.

"An architect of the Obama administration's ""reset"" policy with Russia says he will step down as the American ambassador to the country later this month. Michael McFaul, U.S. ambassador to Russia since January 2012, announced Tuesday he'll leave the post shortly after the Winter Olympics conclude in the southern Russian resort town of Sochi. McFaul has been a controversial figure in Russia, with some state-run media viewing him with suspicion for his outspoken support of pro-democracy groups. But in his online journal, McFaul said Tuesday that he would miss the job, stressing he was leaving for family considerations. McFaul said his wife and two sons moved back to California last summer because his oldest son wanted to be home for the last few years of high school. ""We tried to make a 9,000 kilometer commute work for our family.  But after seven months of separation, I simply need to be with my family again,"" McFaul wrote. ""I will leave Russia reluctantly,"" he said. ""I love this job. It is a tremendous honor to represent my country here. I will miss interacting with my partners in the Russian government and with Russians from all sectors of society."" As a Stanford University political science professor, McFaul became one of the best-known American experts on Russia.  After advising then-Sen. Barack Obama on Russia during the 2008 presidential campaign, McFaul took a leave from Stanford to become senior director for Russia and Eurasian affairs at the National Security Council. He helped develop the U.S. ""reset"" policy with Russia, after which the countries signed the New START arms control deal and agreed on a  transit treaty allowing the United States and NATO to use a route through Russia into Afghanistan. On his arrival in Moscow as ambassador in 2012, he got a rough reception from government-controlled media. An analyst on a government network said McFaul was a ""specialist purely in the promotion of democracy"" and suggested his agenda was dedicated to supporting opposition leaders in the country. That criticism came as protesters in Moscow were rallying against then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who was running again for president. Putin, who went on to win the presidency, accused the U.S. State Department of stirring things up. McFaul's ambassadorship came at a time of strained relations between the two countries, with quarrels over, among other things, Syria's civil war and the arrival in Moscow of admitted National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said Tuesday that President Obama ""is deeply grateful for Ambassador McFaul's extraordinary service over the last five years."" ""From the White House to Spaso House (the U.S. Embassy in Moscow), Mike helped shape policies that advanced America's interest -- from the New START treaty, to resupplying our troops in Afghanistan; from sustaining U.S.-Russian cooperation on negotiations with Iran, to deepening trade and commercial ties,"" Rhodes said.

"New York (CNN) -- Get in line, have your money ready and move to your extreme left -- Al Yeganeh, ""the Original SoupMan,"" is back. He reopened his famed soup store Tuesday in midtown Manhattan. Yeganeh and his Soup Kitchen International first rose to fame after he was caricatured in the long-running NBC-TV show ""Seinfeld"" as the ""Soup Nazi,"" a cranky and demanding soup-stand cook who bellowed ""No soup for you!"" to customers who didn't follow his strict rules for ordering. Yeganeh, who first opened his shop in 1984, closed the store six years ago, but kept the lease to pursue franchise opportunities and a line of frozen soups with the Original SoupMan brand. Loyalty to the brand apparently has not faltered. Avid soup fans lined up around the block Tuesday during New York's steamy heat wave to get a taste. Greg Packer secured the first spot in line by getting to the storefront at 5 a.m. ""I love Al. I love soup. And I can't wait for that first bowl of soup,"" said Packer, who chose chicken vegetable. Daniel Hank, also in the line, said he didn't care if it was 90 degrees or 90 below outside -- he would  wait for his favorite soup, the lobster bisque. ""It's like there's an entire lobster in the cup. You open up the top and a claw comes out and strangles your taste buds. It's so special,"" Hank said. Chef Dan Rubano, who mentored with Yeganeh, was at the store a day before its opening, helping to set things up. ""We are keeping the original recipes and adding more to the menu,"" Rubano said. Although Yeganeh didn't stop by for opening, Rubano said he's expected to make sporadic appearances. According to the ""Seinfeld"" Web site, Yeganeh was at first unhappy with the publicity from the ""Soup Nazi"" episode and was quoted as saying he threatened to ""smack"" comedian Jerry Seinfeld's face. Seinfeld, whose title character was banned during the ""Soup Nazi"" episode, declined to comment on the store's reopening. CNN's Jennifer Rizzo contributed to this report.","Soup Kitchen International reopened Tuesday .

"A report expected this week from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has Israel abuzz with talk of the potential for a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. Western diplomats have told CNN that the report says Iran has mastered the critical steps necessary to design and build a nuclear weapon. Missiles are not, of course,  the only way to launch an attack. Iran's nuclear facilities are under siege from cyber attacks. And one, the Stuxnet virus, was able to penetrate Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, researchers say. How did it work? Stuxnet was stealthy. The Natanz computer network is a closed system, separated from any other network or internet access.  So, Stuxnet infected a third party first, likely a trusted contractor to the Natanz facility. That contractor may then have unknowingly passed on the virus by plugging in an infected removable drive into the computers inside the Natanz facility. More importantly, Stuxnet was smart. It knew exactly what it was looking for: A specific software called Step 7 used specifically to run the Siemens controllers operating at Natanz. Stuxnet spread through the network undetected. If it didn't find the Step 7 software, it left things alone. But once it found its target, Stuxnet set to work. First, it effectively hijacked the Natanz control system, speeding up or slowing down the centrifuges, wearing them out prematurely. As the centrifuges destroyed themselves, Stuxnet sent back signals that everything was fine and running smoothly. So, the operators may not have known this was happening until it was too late. So, just how effective was Stuxnet? According to the Institute for Science and International Security, IAEA records show that between the end of 2009 and early 2010 about 1,000 centrifuges at Natanz  had to be replaced. Stuxnet is the suspected culprit. Still, that's only about one out of every nine centrifuges and, despite a minor dip in production, uranium enrichment continued apace. Who created Stuxnet is still a mystery. Many computer security researchers believe the virus is so complex and sophisticated that it would have needed the resources of a nation state -- or a combination of states -- to produce  it. Researchers at internet security firm Symantec say they have identified a new virus called Duqu that they believe is a successor to Stuxnet, although not all security experts agree. ""This is not a copycat,"" insists Orla Cox of Symantec. ""Whoever created this had access to the same source code as Stuxnet."" Cox says Duqu is, at this stage, a malware designed simply to spy and collect information from Iran's computer systems, but she suspects it may be ultimately intended for sabotage. ""It could be that Stuxnet didn't entirely achieve what was wanted the first time around,"" Cox told CNN. Duqu was released as late as August 2010, just after the Stuxnet virus had done its damage, stunning many researchers who had not expected to see another virus of the same complexity released so quickly. Ralph Langner, the German computer security specialist credited with discovering Stuxnet, says it doesn't matter who created Duqu. The problem, he says, is that Stuxnet, in its bid to stop nuclear proliferation, may have sparked its own arms race. ""The first cyberwar weapon is comparable to the first nuclear weapon,"" he wrote in a blog post recently. ""To build the first nuclear bomb, it took a genius like Oppenheimer and the resources of the Manhattan project. To copy the design, it requires just a bunch of engineers -- no genius needed.","Israel abuzz with talk of potential for pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities .

"At Munich Zoo you can watch the courtship rituals of the banded mongoose, hear the morning song of the scarlet ibis or visit the Indian elephants, who help keep the lights on with electricity generated from their dung. They can do this because Munich Zoo has harnessed ""poo power,"" energy stored in animal waste, which can be converted into a fuel known as ""biogas."" It works like this: The zoo has built three large containers, each capable of holding about 100 cubic meters of animal waste -- that's around  a week's worth of dung collected from all the vegetarian animals in the zoo. Once inside the containers, it's mixed with warm water and the bacteria in the dung is left to decompose in an oxygen-free environment for 30 days. The resulting biogas, mainly comprised of methane and carbon dioxide, rises naturally through vents in the ceiling to a corrugated hut on the roof where it's collected in a ""big balloon,"" says park supervisor Dominik Forster. The biogas is then fed into a gas-powered engine that's used to generate electricity. Forster says that the balloon -- which more closely resembles a small Zeppelin -- can store enough biogas to meet 5% of the zoo's energy needs. ""When you turn the biogas into electricity, it creates heat which we also store,"" says Forster. This is then used to warm the gorilla enclosure, ""but could be used to heat about 25 homes,"" he adds. Once the fermentation process that creates the methane is finished, the remaining solid matter, or ""digestate"" is used as an organic fertilizer for crops that will later be used as feedstock for the animals. ""We don't waste anything,"" said Forster, who claims that his is the only zoo in Germany to generate electricity in this way. A mature elephant can eat about 100 kilograms of fruit, vegetables and pretzels a day, producing a mountain of dung and Forster says that all the zoo animals together create roughly 2,000 tons of the stuff every year. This is enough to power about 100 Munich households -- a drop in the ocean when you consider Munich's population, which is 1.3 million, according to CIA World Factbook. The problem is that dung alone does not produce all that much energy relative to its size, says Geraint Evans, head of biofuels at the UK's National Centre for Biorenewable Energy, Fuels and Materials. ""By the time the food has been digested by the animal, a lot of the energy in it has been used up or burped out,"" he said. ""It's more efficient to just put the feed directly into the biogas generator."" Even if the returns are small at this stage, Evans says this project and others similar are still worth it. ""It's really important that we change our mindset from dependence on one source of energy to many different complementary sources,"" Evans said. ""Animal waste can create electricity, heat, fertilizer ... even clean water can be extracted from the solids to spray on crops ... So, it's emblematic of this very holistic approach."" In this spirit, Forster says there are now plans to install photo-voltaic solar panels on top of the animal enclosures over the coming year.","Zoo in Germany partially powered by electricity produced from animal dung .

"(CNN)If the management and the captain of the sunken tall ship HMS Bounty had ""exercised the proper responsibility, judgment and prudence,"" the deaths of two people would have been prevented, according to a U.S. Coast Guard investigation report released Thursday. Nineteen months after the Bounty sank in Hurricane Sandy off North Carolina, and more than a year after investigative hearings, the Coast Guard issued a wide range of recommendations in the disaster that killed rookie deckhand Claudene Christian and left Capt. Robin Walbridge missing and presumed dead. Fourteen crew members survived. Before it sank roughly 100 miles off Hatteras, the Bounty was arguably the most famous three-masted wooden square rigger in the world. The Coast Guard investigation asked life-and-death questions about proper ship maintenance, the crew's experience and the captain's decision to sail from Connecticut to Florida as Sandy pointed toward the East Coast. The report could determine who, if anyone, might lose maritime licenses as a result of the disaster. During the investigation, officials said the report's findings could be forwarded to prosecutors who would determine whether to file criminal charges. A year after Bounty tragedy, survivors honor victims . The ""most critical"" cause of the sinking, the report said, was the ""failure of the Bounty's management and [captain] to exercise effective oversight and risk management in the overall operation of the Bounty and specifically with undertaking its final voyage in the face of an impending hurricane."" The ""leading cause that contributed to the loss"" of Walbridge and to Christian's death was the captain's ""decision to order the crew to abandon the ship much too late,"" the report said. ""It was just so hard,"" said Bounty survivor Jessica Hewitt, describing her feelings as the report was made public. ""It was hard thinking about Robin and Claudene."" Hewitt, a deckhand on the Bounty, nearly drowned after Sandy's winds and waves tossed her and fellow sailors into the Atlantic. The decision to abandon ship so late after hurricane conditions worsened and the ""fact that the crew had not drilled in months,"" led the report to determine that the captain's ""actions/and or inactions in this regard constitutes negligence."" Hewitt said she agrees with the report's conclusion that Walbridge waited too long to give the order to abandon ship. ""But at the same time I can't even put myself in his shoes when it comes to making that call in a hurricane,"" she said. Since the disaster Hewitt has been struggling to overcome repeated nightmares and deep-seated fears linked to the Bounty, while working on an oil rig supply ship in the Gulf of Mexico. The ships' owner -- HMS Bounty Organization LLC, according to the report, ""committed acts of negligence that contributed to"" Christian's death and the presumed death of Walbridge. Fatigue played a contributing factor in the disaster, the report said. The ""crew was suffering from fatigue which was born out of lack of sleep, being sea sick, and from the physical exertion of fighting to save the vessel while in extreme weather conditions for over 24 hours."" The Bounty operated as a recreational vessel under ""less stringent safety standards,"" the report said. It recommended that the Coast Guard ""examine if legislative, regulatory or policy changes are needed."" ""Inspections should be thorough and should take a long time,"" Hewitt said. ""I would be in favor of a higher level of training when you're making passages."" But Hewitt remains protective of ships like the Bounty that serve as training vessels for inexperienced sailors such as Christian. ""You've got to keep that going,"" Hewitt said. The Coast Guard handled its investigation in a way that was both thorough and respectful of the crew, she said. Read the full report . The Bounty was a movie star, a re-creation of the infamous 18th-century British navy vessel of the same name, constructed by a Canadian shipbuilder for the 1962 MGM film ""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" starring Marlon Brando and Trevor Howard. Claudene Christian, who was 42, had said she was a descendant of the original Bounty's lead mutineer, Fletcher Christian. More recently, the Bounty had appeared in Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie franchise. But the Bounty was never designed to sail the sea for 50 years. And the aging vessel had maintenance issues that would be expected of a half-century old, 180-foot-long ship made of oak and Douglas fir. Did the crew have enough experience? Questioning during the Coast Guard hearing frequently centered around the crew's experience. The Bounty was Claudene Christian's first job on a sailing vessel. In fact, 10 of Bounty's 15 crew members had been aboard for less than a year, including two who'd joined less than a month before its last voyage. Christian had been hired just five months before. Life and death on the HMS Bounty . Her family remains in settlement talks in the wake of a $90 million civil lawsuit the Christians filed against the ship's owner, the New York-based HMS Bounty Organization, headed by Robert Hansen. Hansen declined to testify at the Coast Guard hearings, evoking his Fifth Amendment constitutional rights against incriminating himself. Hansen has repeatedly declined CNN requests for interviews, although he has said more than once he intended to tell his side of the story, eventually. On Thursday, in an e-mail to CNN, Hansen wrote, ""I cannot comment while there is pending litigation."" An attorney for Christian's family, Ralph Mellusi, said the report will help push his case toward a final resolution. The investigation also focused on Walbridge's decision to sail despite knowing that Hurricane Sandy was threatening to move up the East Coast. Walbridge set sail for St. Petersburg, Florida, from New London, Connecticut. Crew members testified that Walbridge's plan was to stay east of the storm as it moved up the coast. But two days into the voyage, the captain diverted from his plan and ordered a course change. Crew members testified that Walbridge wanted to pilot the ship northwest of Sandy to harness its winds. Turning more westerly, the boat crossed the path of the oncoming hurricane. The weather worsened. The Bounty found itself in big trouble. Seawater leaking into the ship knocked out power to water pumps and engines, leaving the Bounty adrift while being battered by the raging storm. Wind gusts above 100 mph and waves as high as 30 feet flipped Bounty on its side, tossing everyone into the predawn Atlantic. While the crew tried to keep their heads above the towering waves, the wind slammed the ship's mast and rigging on top of them. Getting tangled in underwater rigging nearly drowned some crew members, who were barely able to free themselves and swim to the ship's lifeboats. Hours later, Coast Guard rescuers were able to save 14 crew members. Christian was pulled from the water. She was unresponsive and couldn't be revived. As for the captain, Walbridge's body was never found. Shortly after Hewitt got word that the investigation report was available, she took a moment to try to read it. ""I started to cry,"" she said. ""And I said, 'I can't do this.'"" Hewitt said the release of the report has brought her emotional state back to 2012, during the painful hours immediately following the crew's rescue. Officials were asking her questions. ""I was sitting in a room and looking out the window and I remember the weather was really crappy outside and I'm thinking, 'Oh that's right, this nightmare is still going on. I'm being asked to tell this story.'"" For some reason, Hewitt still remembers that her hair was still wet that day, as she sat in that room. ""Now, with the report coming out, I kind of feel like my hair is still wet,"" she said. ""You know what I mean?"" 'We chase hurricanes' During the 2013 investigative hearings, Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board officials asked surviving crew members whether Walbridge believed it was acceptable to intentionally sail near hurricanes. As evidence, the Coast Guard introduced a YouTube video of Walbridge where he says, ""We chase hurricanes."" In the video, Walbridge explained how to ""get a good ride"" out of a hurricane by sailing ""as close to the eye of it as you can"" and staying behind the storm in its southeast quadrant. Without a doubt, the captain's harshest critic at the hearing was Jan Miles, one of the world's most respected tall-ship pilots and a self-described friend of Walbridge. Captain of the Pride of Baltimore II, Miles summed up Walbridge's actions in four words: ""reckless in the extreme."" The Coast Guard's report follows final conclutions released in February by the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB determined the Bounty tragedy was largely caused by Walbridge's ""reckless decision to sail ... into the well-forecast path of Hurricane Sandy."" NTSB says captain shares blame for Bounty disaster . Questions at the hearing pointed to the ship's maintenance record. Extensive repairs had been made to the Bounty twice in the past decade, and some work had been done weeks before it sailed, according to crew testimony. Rot infested 18-foot wooden planks on Bounty's forward right and left sides. Workers replaced them and caulked cracks and gaps in the ship's hull below the waterline. Walbridge was warned by the shipyard that some of the boat's frames -- its ribs -- also contained rot, multiple witnesses testified. The shipyard manager testified that the captain said he'd do the repairs later. But not before he chose to sail toward Hurricane Sandy. The way Bounty was licensed, it wasn't subject to the toughest Coast Guard inspections or mandatory repairs. The owners chose to license the ship as an uninspected passenger vessel, a classification described by experts at the hearing as a ""regulatory no man's land."" The status allowed the Bounty to avoid requirements reserved for higher classified ships -- including a sometimes expensive, time-consuming Coast Guard hull inspection every two years. The ship's classification also allowed it to hire less experienced crew to serve in officer positions. The ship made its money by charging admission for shipboard tours at dockside. Under the regulations, the Bounty required only a simple, brief Coast Guard inspection that checked for obvious safety issues such as major leaks or malfunctioning emergency equipment. The Bounty passed one of these about two months before the disaster. No safety inspections were required for the ship to go to sea because the Bounty carried no passengers.","Release of report dredges up dark memories for Bounty shipwreck survivor .

"Eric Harroun, an Army veteran from Phoenix who was accused of fighting alongside al Qaeda-affiliated militants in Syria -- and then freed after pleading guilty to a lesser charge -- has died, according to his family and officials in Phoenix, Arizona. Maricopa County spokeswoman Cari Gerchick confirmed his death and added that the county's medical examiner was scheduled to conduct an autopsy on Thursday. According to his family, 31-year-old Harroun died Tuesday of an apparent overdose. The family did not elaborate beyond saying on a Facebook page toxicology reports would provide more information. The former soldier, who served with the Army from 2000 to 2003, was arrested in March 2013 and charged with conspiring to use a rocket propelled grenade while fighting with the al-Nusra Front, an alias name for the terrorist group al Qaeda in Iraq. Harroun allegedly posted videos on the Internet showing him with weapons. In September, Harroun pleaded guilty to a lesser charge to avoid a possible sentence of 30 years to life if convicted of the more serious offense. Harroun had spent six months in federal prison in Alexandria, Virginia, including time in solitary confinement, and a federal judge sentenced to time served. He was then released from custody. The case presented U.S. attorneys with the challenge of prosecuting an American citizen for fighting alongside a U.S. designated terrorist organization, despite the group's alignment with American interests. The U.S., like the Jabhat al-Nusra Front, both opposed the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Harroun's attorney, Geremy Kamen, said this week that, to his knowledge, Harroun's case was unprecedented. Kamen noted that an FBI agent testified that there was no evidence of Harroun was involved in any terrorist activities.","Eric Harroun initially was charged with fighting alongside group affiliated with al Qaeda .

"By Election Day in November, Hillary Clinton will have stumped for candidates in over 15 states, with sometimes multiple events at each destination. What does this mean: Lots of speeches. As most politicians have some formula of commonly used phrases and lines of attack, the former secretary of state has started to shape a stump speech with similar wording for praise of those she endorses and jabs for her Republican opponents. The lines are more than just cliches, however. They shed light on the type of campaign Clinton would have if she decided to run for president in 2016, and highlight what she will focus on and how she has learned from many of the mistakes that caused her to lose to Barack Obama in 2008. Here are Hillary Clinton's seven most used lines on the 2014 stump: . 1.) [Insert candidate's name] is the ""right leader at the right time with the right plan"" This is Clinton's go-to endorsement line and she's used it regularly this fall. ""There is no doubt the governor is the right leader at the right time with the right plan,"" Clinton said during an event with Gov. Andrew Cuomo in New York last week. Clinton used the same line -- almost exactly  -- for Democratic candidate Tom Wolf in Pennsylvania and Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado this month. ""You are convinced as I am convinced that Tom Wolf is the right leader and the right time for Pennsylvania hard working people,"" Clinton said of Wolf. 2.) ""It's as though the other side wants to cast an air of amnesia"" Clinton, who spent four years separated from politics as America's top diplomat, has stepped up her Republican attack lines on the stump, and she seems extremely fond of linking the ""other side"" with ""amnesia."" ""It appears to me that the campaigns being run against them are depending on the voters of Colorado having a mass case of amnesia,"" Clinton said in her endorsement of Udall and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. They want voters to ""somehow just forget the accomplishments."" Clinton made a similar argument for Martha Coakley, Massachusetts' Democratic governor nominee, earlier this month. Republicans are counting on ""amnesia in this midterm election,"" Clinton said, adding they were hoping ""people will forget what they have done and what they could do. We have been down the road. That is what is happening."" At a fundraiser in California earlier this year, she said this: ""It's as though the other side wants to cast an air of amnesia."" The line appears to be borrowed from her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who while stumping for candidates in 2010 accused Republicans of ""amnesia."" ""The Republicans are trying to make this a referendum on people's anger ...  with a good dose of amnesia,"" Clinton said while endorsing Sen. Richard Blumenthal in 2010, according to reports. 3.) ""You can't take anything for granted."" Clinton usually employs this line when she is stumping for Democrats who are way up in the polls. ""If you don't show up, you don't know what is going to happen,"" Clinton said in Minnesota earlier this month where she endorsed Gov. Mark Dayton and Sen. Al Franken, two Democrats who look likely to win. ""You can't take anything for granted."" The line is more than just a call for voters to activate, however. In 2008, Clinton found herself with a sizable lead over then-Sen. Barack Obama. Clinton went on to lose the nomination fight and some critics of the campaign said it was because Clinton's top advisers saw her win as a forgone conclusion. But as much at it is a call to voters, the line is a nod to what Clinton has learned about campaigning. ""I want you to promise yourselves before you leave here tonight that you won't just come to this beautiful Constitution Center and listen to the speeches and the music then go home feeling good,"" Clinton said in Pennsylvania where she endorsed frontrunner Wolf for governor. ""You need to resolve to do everything you can to make sure you don't take this election for granted."" 4.) ""Everyone deserves a second chance, a third chance..."" Clinton has focused a great deal on economic populism on the stump, an issue other Democrats thinking about seeking the presidency in 2016 have started to tweak Clinton on. ""Everyone deserves a second chance, a third chance to keep going and to make something of themselves,"" Clinton said in Iowa earlier this year. ""That was one of the most important lessons of my life."" Clinton usually uses the line to encourage compassion from a crowd, and to show that she has compassion, too. ""The only direction that matters in life is forward,"" Clinton said in Minnesota. ""Never quit. Never lose faith. When you get knocked down get right back up, recognize there is worth and dignity in every human being and that everyone â€” everyone â€” deserves not just a chance but a second chance and even a third chance and a better life for themselves and their families."" 5.) ""Women hold a majority of minimum wage jobs in our country."" This is a double whammy for Clinton: In one line, she nods to women and the economic struggles that many women -- and men -- are experiencing. Clinton's many appearances have focused a great deal on women and this line has become a staple. ""Women hold a majority of minimum wage jobs in our country,"" Clinton said in San Francisco earlier this month. ""When women succeed, America succeeds."" Clinton used a similar line in North Carolina while stumping for Sen. Kay Hagan, at an event for the Democratic National Committee earlier this year at an event with other female politicians in Washington, D.C in September. ""If we had been able to close the gap between men and women participating in the work force, our Gross Domestic Product would be 10 percent higher,"" Clinton said at the event. ""Why are we leaving 10% on the table because we don't do enough to give women the support that they need to be empowered, to take care of themselves and their families?"" 6.) ""Grandmother glow"" Hillary Clinton recently became a grandmother, and those who attend her stump speeches get reminded of that pretty quickly. Clinton has made her new granddaughter -- Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky -- a staple of her stump speech and usually uses the one month old to pivot to her vision for the future and the world she and other Democrats want to leave for their children and grandchildren. Clinton unveiled the line during an October paid speech in Miami, Florida. ""You look beautiful,"" said the moderator of a question and answer with Clinton. ""I think it is a grandmother glow,"" she responded. Since then, the line has been regularly repeated. She took the line a step further in Charlotte, North Carolina on Saturday, giving a nod to the city's name within the first two minutes of her speech. ""It is pretty excited being here in Charlotte,"" Clinton said. ""I mean, it is true that I am a new grandmother, a month tomorrow. I still have that grandmother glow."" She added, ""But I just can't tell you how much we love the name."" 7.) ""Fear is the last resort of those who have run out of hope"" This is another way Clinton hits Republicans. She accuses the party of peddling fear because, as she says, that is what people do when they have ""run out of gas."" The line is regularly used when she is endorsing candidates who are facing stiff opposition and a sizable amount of outside spending and ads. ""Elections come down often to who's got more money, who's peddling more fear and who turns out,"" Clinton told the audience in North Carolina. ""We want leaders like Kay Hagan, who appeal to our hopes, not our fears,"" she later added. So far, $80 million has been spent in Hagan's race against Tillis and local voters have complained about the number of negative ads. ""There is a reason that the senators and the governor's opponents are running campaigns based on fear,"" Clinton said in Colorado. ""Fear is the last resort of those who have run out of hope... run out of gas.""","Hillary Clinton is shaping her campaign speech, including some recyclable lines .

"The irony of Dianne Feinstein's center-stage moment this week was palpable. Just as she is leaving her coveted position as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, handing the reins to the incoming Republican majority â€” and as questions abound in her home state about whether she will retire -- she seemed to reach the pinnacle of her power, once again showing willingness to buck members of her party and wave off critics. Facing few political consequences in California where her Senate seat is firmly in her grasp, Feinstein, 81, was defiant as she took the Senate floor Tuesday to announce the release of a 525-page summary of the Intelligence Committee's report on the CIA's treatment of detainees â€”the product of five years of line-by-line scrutiny of some six million internal government documents. It was a scorching condemnation of the harsh interrogation techniques of the Bush era with the striking conclusion that those ""deeply flawed"" tactics had failed to produce information that thwarted terrorist attacks or led to the apprehension of terrorist suspects. In fact, Feinstein said, torture often led to ""false information."" Even in a post-Sept. 11th era, the techniques revealed -- mock executions, waterboarding, detainees stripped and chained to a concrete floor, others deprived of sleep for up to 180 hours -- were chilling. Arrows flew at Feinstein from many directions. She was under pressure from Secretary of State John Kerry to delay the release of the report until the New Year, but did not buckle. The CIA scoffed at the report's ""flawed analyses of the techniques"" and refuted its central conclusion that their procedures had failed to prevent attacks. The FBI issued a warning that the report could spark a reaction from violent extremists. Republican critics like Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida took to Twitter deriding the document as ""a one-sided partisan Senate report that now places American lives in danger."" Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn argued that the report had vilified operatives at the CIA who should be hailed as heroes for attempting to protect the American public. Unapologetic . But the one-time mayor of San Francisco, who has held her Senate seat for 22 years, was unapologetic. While it was true, she said, that the report was going out in a ""period of turmoil and instability"" in many corners of the world: ""That's going to continue for the foreseeable future whether this report is released or not."" She added that she hoped the release would show the world that ""America is big enough to admit when it's wrong and confident enough to learn from its mistakes."" Feinstein also seemed to put a point on her own legacy: ""History will judge us by our commitment to a just society governed by law and the willingness to face an ugly truth and say: 'Never again.'"" Unlike some Senate Democrats who were voted out of office last month, Feinstein faced her critics this week without any concern of political consequences in her home state. ""Dianne Feinstein can serve in the United States Senate for as long as she wants,"" said Dan Schnur, who heads the University of Southern California's Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. ""It's hard to imagine her facing a credible challenge if she did decide to run for re-election, which puts her in the relatively rare position of not having to worry about public opinion on this.  A senator facing a precarious re-election campaign might be a little more worried about taking on the country's national security leadership."" Younger generation . Still, there is intense speculation within California about whether Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Boxer, who are up for re-election in 2016 and 2018, respectively, will step aside after their current terms. That would create a game of musical chairs for the younger generation of California Democrats like Attorney General Kamala Harris, Lieutenant Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and his successor, Eric Garcetti. Many Californians would like to see that fight play out. In a recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll, 59% percent of registered voters said California would be better off with new candidates as the state's U.S. Senators. But that does not mean that Feinstein is in danger of being tossed from her seat. The Republican Party has been decimated in California -- with no viable challengers on the horizon -- and it is highly unlikely that the party's younger generation would take her on. Unlike Boxer, 73, who has hinted from time to time about the possibility of retirement, Feinstein has given no indication that she is thinking about leaving the Senate. Feinstein, known across California and Capitol Hill as ""DiFi,"" has reached her enviable position as an unapologetic but sometimes unpredictable progressive with centrist tendencies. Her memorable introduction to the statewide stage in California was when she was ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1990 and delivered a speech to the Democratic state party convention embracing the death penalty. ""Yes, I support the death penalty. It is an issue that cannot be fudged or hedged,"" she told the crowd, which drowned her out with a loud chorus of boos. Seeking alliances . When she and Boxer were elected to the Senate in ""the year of the woman"" in 1992, they took markedly different paths. Both championed women's issues like abortion rights. But while Boxer became known as a shrill partisan, Feinstein earned a reputation as a hard worker who continually sought alliances with colleagues on the other side of the aisle. ""Feinstein has been known throughout her Senate career as conciliator, someone who can bring together warring parties to find common ground on difficult issues,"" said Schnur. ""But there are certain issues on which she doesn't compromise and she digs in and fights."" Those fights have sometimes surprised her supporters and made it difficult to slap her with the label of a California liberal. She has long championed the assault weapon ban, for example, but also supported the Iraq War and defended Bush administration surveillance practices that were anathema to liberals. She notably called Edward J. Snowden's leaks of classified information about U.S. intelligence ""an act of treason."" And she infuriated liberals with her backing of the NSA's broad-reaching and covert effort to collect data from the telephone calls of Americans. She felt compelled to do so out of a sense of obligation to ""keep this country safe,"" she told the New York Times in a 2013 interview, ""So put that in your pipe and smoke it."" That long history of contradictions has given Feinstein more running room than other Democrats on issues like torture, said California Democratic Strategist Dan Newman, who recently helped manage Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown's re-election campaign. ""She's viewed as thorough, thoughtful, and as close to non-partisan on the issue of national security as is possible in today's politically polarized environment,"" Newman said.  ""If it was a different Democrat, it would be easier for some to be dismissive of the questions she's raising, but she's built significant credibility as a trusted voice on national security, so she has to be taken seriously.  She's raising two critical issues which will define our debate about torture in the coming months: does it make us safer, and is it something we accept as consistent with our nation's moral code?"" As Senate Democrats transition to the minority, some have suggested that Feinstein is at the twilight of her career. Not so fast, her allies say. She's content to let others play that political parlor game, while she remains mum about her plans. Bill Carrick, Feinstein's longtime campaign consultant who began working with her in 1989, noted that her policy agenda is still lengthy, topped with complex issues like California's water woes. As for retirement? ""She doesn't spend any time thinking about that,"" he said.","Torture report was a powerful moment for Feinstein .
While some in California clamor for new leaders, Feinstein mum on plans .
Over her long career, Feinstein has defied labels ."
"It's not every day that White House has to defend its decision to nominate a soap opera producer to represent the country on one of the highest diplomatic levels. But it was that kind of Tuesday. Asked at the daily press briefing what makes ""The Bold and The Beautiful"" producer Colleen Bell qualified to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Hungary, White House spokesman Josh Earnest didn't exactly have an explanation. ""(She's) somebody who obviously has succeeded in, you know, in the business world,"" Earnest said. ""And she is somebody that the President has confidence will be able to maintain our relationship with the government and the people of Hungary."" Earnest also denied that Bell's hand in raising millions of dollars for the President's re-election campaign had anything to do with her appointment. ""Well, I can tell you that that's not the reason she was chosen,"" he said. Earnest said the reason Bell was nominated for the post was because the President ""has complete confidence in her ability to represent the United States in that country."" But not everyone will be satisfied with that answer. Just hours before, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, blasted Bell's nomination on the Senate floor. ""We're about to vote on a totally unqualified individual to be ambassador to a nation which is very important to our national security interests,"" he said. ""I am not against political appointees ... but here we are, a nation that's on the verge of seceded its sovereignty to a neo-fascist dictator getting in bed with Vladimir Putin and we're gonna send the producer of 'The Bold and the Beautiful' as our ambassador,"" McCain said. Bell was confirmed to the position Tuesday by a Democrat-led Senate. The chamber also confirmed Noah Mamet, another Democratic fundraiser, as the ambassador to Argentina. This is not the first diplomatic position the President has selected Bell for. In 2010, Obama appointed Bell to the President's Advisory Committee on the Arts at the Kennedy Center. â€‹ .","A soap opera producer was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Hungary by President Barack Obama .

"A pro-al Qaeda group responsible for a previous armed assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi is the chief suspect in Tuesday's attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya, sources tracking militant Islamist groups in eastern Libya say. They also note that the attack immediately followed a call from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri for revenge for the death in June of Abu Yahya al-Libi,  a senior Libyan member of the terror group. The group suspected to be behind the assault -- the Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades -- first surfaced in May when it claimed responsibility for an attack on the International Red Cross office in Benghazi. The following month the group claimed responsibility for detonating an explosive device outside the U.S. Consulate and later released a video of that attack. Noman Benotman, once a leading member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and now based at the Quilliam Foundation in London told CNN, ""An attack like this would likely have required preparation. This would not seem to be merely a protest which escalated."" Slain ambassador died 'trying to help build a better Libya' ""According to our sources, the attack was the work of roughly 20 militants, prepared for a military assault; it is rare that an RPG7 is present at a peaceful protest,"" Benotman said. ""According to our sources, the attack against the consulate had two waves. The first attack led to U.S. officials being evacuated from the consulate by Libyan security forces, only for the second wave to be launched against U.S. officials after they were kept in a secure location."" That analysis is supported by U.S. sources who say the attack on the consulate is believed to have been pre-planned. The sources say the attackers used the protest as a diversion to launch the attack, although the sources could not say if the attackers instigated the protest or merely took advantage of it. The sources do not believe the ambassador was directly targeted. Libyan Deputy Interior Minister Wanis al-Sharif, speaking at a news conference in Benghazi on Wednesday, said that ""among the protesters, there were some who infiltrated the march to start chaos."" Six things to know about the attack . Benotman, who had earlier warned of the likelihood of renewed attacks against U.S. interest in Libya, said the Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades is a prime suspect in the Benghazi attack Tuesday. He believes it is likely the deadly attack was also linked to a video statement released by al-Zawahiri on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. In the video, al-Zawahiri confirmed the death of al-Libi -- a prominent member of the al Qaeda-linked group -- adding:  ""His blood is calling, urging and inciting you to fight and kill the crusaders."" The video released by the Brigades in June showed nighttime explosions around the consulate, interlaced with footage of Osama bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, along with images from the 9/11 attacks. At the time the Brigades claimed it had launched the attack in response to the first reports of al-Libi's death in a drone strike in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Notably, the Brigades said the June 5 attack was also timed to coincide with preparations for the arrival of a senior U.S. State Department official. ""The time frame of attacks shows that the group has been following and actively involved in gathering information about the activities of diplomatic missions in the country,"" Benotman wrote in a June briefing paper on the group. He adds that it appears the Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades was also responsible for a rocket attack against the convoy of the British ambassador in Benghazi on June 11 and an attack against the Red Cross in Misrata on June 12. Libyan and Western security officials tell CNN that al Qaeda has taken advantage of a security vacuum to build up a presence in eastern Libya. A senior Libyan official told CNN in June that the United States had flown surveillance missions with drones over suspected jihadist training camps in eastern Libya. The official said that, to the best of his knowledge, they had not been used to fire missiles at militant training camps in the area. Ambassador's killing shines light on Muslim sensitivities around Prophet Mohammed . Another Libyan official told CNN at the same time that five radical Islamist militant commanders were operating in the Derna area, with 200 to 300 men under their command in camps in the area. Ironically, Christopher Stevens -- the U.S. ambassador killed in Tuesday's attack -- had written extensively about the rise of Salafist factions in and around Derna in a 2008 diplomatic cable. As CNN has previously reported, one of militant commanders, according to several sources, is Abdulbasit Azuz, a long-time associate of al-Zawahiri. Azuz was dispatched by al-Zawahiri to Libya from Pakistan's tribal areas in the spring of 2011 to create a foothold for al Qaeda in Libya, the sources say. Azuz is a veteran jihadist who fought the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan in the early 1990s, according to several sources. He later moved to the United Kingdom, where he increasingly came on the radar screen of British security services for his radical recruitment efforts in Manchester. In the period after the July 2005 London bombings, he was detained in the Belmarsh high-security prison and placed under a control order, according to the sources. He left the United Kingdom in 2009 and traveled to the tribal areas of Pakistan, according to the sources. According to one source, Azuz has dispatched men as far west as Ajdabiya and Brega in his attempt to build up al Qaeda operations in eastern Libya. According to Libyan security sources, within the militant ranks in Derna there are 20 to 30 hardcore jihadist fighters who are cause for most concern. One source said a number of Egyptian jihadists are also present in the Derna area, as well as fighters belonging to al Qaeda's North African affiliate, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Another militant whose activities have caused concern in eastern Libya is Sufian bin Qumu, a released Guantanamo detainee who is believed to be operating a camp in a remote area outside Derna. His detainee assessment at the prison camp described him as having a ""long-term association with Islamist extremist Jihad and members of Al-Qaida and other extremist groups."" Libyan officials confirmed his presence in the area to CNN in June. Townsend: Libya has been suffering 'fragile security' Libyan security services have so far not moved against the militants, casting doubt over their ability to bring security to the country. Many areas are still dominated by brigades that fought to topple Libya strongman Moammar al-Gadhafi and bands of heavily armed young men who have turned to criminality. Derna has for years been a recruiting ground for al Qaeda. In his 2008 cable, Stevens described the area as ""a wellspring of Libyan foreign fighters"" for al Qaeda in Iraq, and outlined how high youth unemployment, discrimination by the Gadhafi regime and the influence of veteran Libyan jihadists from Afghanistan all played a role in radicalizing a new generation. In recent months, hardline Salafists have increasingly asserted themselves in eastern Libya. In June hundreds of fighters wielding AK-47s and black Islamist banners converged on Benghazi to call for the imposition of sharia law. This spring al-Zawahiri's associate Azuz was confident enough to address a large gathering in the town square of Derna, an online video of which has been seen by CNN. Stevens warned in '08 about extremists near Benghazi . Collectively, some of the Salafist and jihadist elements in eastern Libya began to become known as Ansar al Sharia, or ""Partisans of Sharia."" According to reports, eyewitnesses have claimed Ansar al Sharia was responsible for organizing the demonstration outside the U.S. Consulate. But Benotman told CNN Ansar al Sharia is not really a grouping at all but rather a term applied to an amorphous coalition of Islamist and Salafist groups in eastern Libya with no leadership structure. Despite concerns over the growing audacity of Salafist-jihadist groups, the victory of secular parties in elections in July had created a measure of optimism about Libya's future. Benotman tells CNN the reality is that a large majority of Libyans, including the majority of Islamists, are opposed to al Qaeda's ideology of global jihad. He predicts a backlash against the perpetrators of the attack. ""People will curse them for this,"" he told CNN.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on two top al Qaeda suspects, according to a Bush-era Justice Department memo released by the Obama administration. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, seen in a December sketch, was waterboarded 183 times in a month, a memo says. The controversial technique that simulates drowning -- and which President Obama calls torture -- was used at least 83 times in August 2002 on suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah, according to the memo. Interrogators also waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times in March 2003. Mohammed is believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Obama released the memo Thursday, saying that ""exceptional circumstances surround these memos and require their release.""  Watch other tactics outlined in memos » . The memo, dated May 30, 2005, was from then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury to John Rizzo, who was acting general counsel for the CIA. It paints a different picture from the one described by former CIA officer John Kiriakou. In a December 2007 interview with CNN, Kiriakou said Zubaydah had been waterboarded for ""about 30 seconds, 35 seconds"" and agreed to cooperate with interrogators the following day. In an interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Michael Hayden, who directed the CIA from 2006 to 2009, was asked about the number of times Mohammed was waterboarded. Hayden denounced the release of the memos and did not comment on the number, saying it was his understanding that the frequency of waterboarding was among the operational details that had not been declassified.  Watch one expert say tactics 'worse than Abu Ghraib' » . The 2005 memo refers to a letter that had contained the numbers as well. Part of the reference to the letter was redacted in the released memo. Waterboarding is among the interrogation tactics that Obama has prohibited through an executive order. The CIA also has admitted waterboarding Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the first person charged in the United States for the 2000 attack on the USS Cole in Yemen that killed 17 U.S. sailors. Obama said last week he felt comfortable releasing the classified memos because the Bush administration acknowledged using some of the practices associated with the memos, and the interrogation techniques were widely reported and have since been banned. ""Withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time,"" Obama said in a statement. ""This could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past, and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the United States."" The president applauded the work of the U.S. intelligence community and said no one who ""carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice"" would be prosecuted.","Memo: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed waterboarded 183 times in one month .

Those are some of the many questions about reports of the arrest of a woman that regional sources describe as al-Baghdadi's wife, al-Dulaimi, but who Iraq's Interior Ministry said Wednesday is anything but. What makes the situation even murkier is how little is known about al-Baghdadi. Yes, he heads the self-declared Islamic State, leading a group that has used brutal tactics -- think beheading innocents, kidnapping civilians, raping women -- to overtake vast swaths of Syria and Iraq. Yes, he fashions himself as a spiritual authority as he spearheads efforts to spread his group's extreme form of Sharia law to any territory it touches, and to punish nonbelievers along the way. But al-Baghdadi the man is a mystery. And so is his family, his wife or wives included. Which brings us back to the woman being held by Lebanese authorities. Is she not his wife, as the Iraqi ministry suggests, or perhaps an ex-wife, as American sources in Washington say? Or is she a ""powerful figure (who is) heavily involved in ISIS,"" as a source with knowledge of her arrest told CNN? And if it's the latter, what role did she play in the terrorist group? And what was she doing in Lebanon, a country on the fringes of Syria's years-long civil war? She's his wife, or his ex-wife, or neither . The reported detention of a wife and child of al-Baghdadi has made many wonder who exactly the woman is and what she might know about the terrorist group's inner workings. Authorities in Lebanon, where the woman was arrested, haven't officially commented on the matter. Neither has the CIA, amid suggestions that Western intelligence was involved in her capture. But the Iraqi Interior Ministry, citing a source in an intelligence cell under its authority, said the woman's identity didn't match up with either of the names it has for al-Baghdadi's two wives, Asma Fawzi Mohammed al-Dulaimi and Israa Rajab Mahal Al-Qaisi. ""There is no wife named Saja al-Dulaimi,"" the ministry stated bluntly, saying al-Dulaimi is the sister of a man who is imprisoned in Iraq and has been sentenced to death for a series of bombings. It doesn't help that Baghdadi's family life is cloaked in mystery. A biography posted on jihadist websites last year gave little away, stating simply that he was ""married."" CNN was told that al-Baghdadi has two wives. The news agency Reuters, citing tribal sources in Iraq, said he has three. And ISIS certainly isn't confirming anything. Some of its members took to social media Tuesday to deny that any wife of al-Baghdadi had been arrested. She wielded power, but how much? If the woman is indeed Al-Dulaimi, she is ""very active"" in the organization, a regional source with knowledge of the operation told CNN. She was reported to have previously been held by the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. In March, al-Dulaimi was released from Syrian custody as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in return for a group of Syrian nuns, an intelligence source told CNN. But her apparent attempt to cross into Lebanon with a child at a time when authorities there are tightening security around the border raises questions about the state of her relationship with al-Baghdadi. ""Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?"" asked Sajjan M. Gohel, the international security director at the Asia Pacific Foundation. Uncertainty also remains about how much influence al-Dulaimi would have had within ISIS, which is known for its oppressive treatment of women. Analysts say women who join ISIS may find their role limited to that of housewife for jihadi men. But in February, ISIS formed Al-Khansaa, a female battalion with about 60 members whose job is to inspect women who pass through checkpoints and to enforce the organization's strict morality code for women. She could reveal vital intelligence, or hardly anything . The arrest of al-Dulaimi, if it was her,  was a coordinated operation involving intelligence agencies from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, an intelligence source familiar with the arrest told CNN. The source said the Iraqis had help from the U.S. intelligence community, an account corroborated by a second source in the region with knowledge of the operation. But in Washington, the CIA had no comment on the matter. Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, expressed confidence that the United States would be able to ""gain some intelligence"" from al-Dulaimi. ""We may get insights into al-Baghdadi's movement, who he surrounds himself with, whether he was injured, and the degree of his injuries,"" he said, referring to recent reports that al-Baghdadi was hurt in airstrikes. Not everyone was convinced she would provide a treasure trove of insight into ISIS, though. Expressing skepticism, a former senior U.S. military official told The New York Times that in the Iraq war, the Americans captured a wife of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader or al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIS' forerunner. ""We got little out of her, and when we sent her back, Zarqawi killed her,"" the unidentified official told the newspaper. And since al-Dulaimi was reportedly seized more than a week ago, what intelligence she carried may already have passed its sell-by date. ""In military conflicts, information flows are very immediate, and they become yesterday's news very quickly,"" said Michael Stephens, a Middle East research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. She was with a son, or a daughter . The identity of the child with al-Dulaimi is still the subject of conflicting reports. An intelligence source told CNN that the child was al-Dulaimi's 4-year-old son. Other news organizations, including Agence France-Presse and The Associated Press, also reported that it was a young boy. But Reuters, which originally reported the same thing, later revised its reporting to say that she was with a daughter. The New York Times also said it was a daughter rather than a son. Deepening the intrigue, one regional source even told CNN that al-Baghdadi himself has been calling up, asking for his son to be released. The full picture of who exactly Lebanese authorities have in their custody is still to be revealed.","There are conflicting reports on many details about the woman detained in Lebanon .
Some intelligence officials have said she's the ISIS leaders' wife, others say an ex-wife .
A source tells CNN she was with a son, but other reports suggest it was a daughter ."
"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's decision to order a raid against Osama bin Laden in Pakistan was a courageous and gutsy call, said U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates. ""I've worked for a lot of these guys and this is one of the most courageous calls -- decisions -- that I think I've ever seen a president make,"" he said during a CBS ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Sunday night. ""It was a very gutsy call."" The outgoing defense secretary said he had ""real reservations"" about the intelligence surrounding the raid. ""I was very concerned, frankly,"" he said. ""My worry was the level of uncertainty about whether bin Laden was even in the compound. There wasn't any direct evidence that he was there. It was all circumstantial, but it was the best information that we had since probably 2001."" U.S. officials had tracked a trusted bin Laden courier for years, who they believed was living with and protecting the al Qaeda leader. They were confident the courier lived at the Pakistan compound, but were not certain that bin Laden lived there too. The courier and his brother were among those killed in the raid. Gates said it would be ""premature"" to talk about whether bin Laden's death could accelerate the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, now slated to start in July, but said he believes the United States is gaining the upper hand there. ""We have over the last 18 months put in place, for the first time, the resources necessary to ensure that this threat does not rebuild -- does not re-emerge -- once we're gone. I think we could be in a position by the end of this year where we have turned the corner in Afghanistan,"" he said. Gates, the only Cabinet member from the previous administration to stay on when Obama came into office, is expected to step down this year. Former President George W. Bush nominated Gates as the nation's 22nd secretary of defense in December 2006 to replace Donald Rumsfeld, one of the architects of the Iraq war. During the early months of his tenure, Gates focused on implementing the ""troop surge"" in Iraq, a strategy change that was under consideration before he became secretary. It called for increasing the number of troops in Iraq and focusing their efforts in Baghdad. The goal was to have Iraqi troops take the lead in military matters and allow political progress to proceed by isolating extremists. Although many on both sides of the political spectrum opposed the idea of 20,000 more American troops in Iraq, by 2008 violence declined, and Gates began overseeing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country, an endeavor that continues. ""I think had we left here with our tail between our legs, and with chaos, it would have been very bad for our army and for our military,"" he said. Still, Gates told CBS that he was worried the United States would be ""penny-wise and pound-foolish"" in Iraq in the months and years to come. The defense secretary also lashed out at the institution he runs during the wide-ranging interview, criticizing Pentagon bureaucracy. ""I think the hardest thing for me to deal with is leading a department that is organized to plan for war but not to fight a war. And so everything that I wanted to do to try to help the men and women in the field, I've had to do outside the normal Pentagon bureaucracy ... that's been very frustrating,"" he said. ""I've ruffled a few feathers at all the institutions I've led, but I think that's part of leadership.""","Gates says Obama's call was gutsy and courageous .

"Longer lines at airport checkpoints would result from eliminating a nearly $1 billion Behavior Detection Officers program, the head of the Transportation Security Administration told a congressional committee Thursday. The Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques, or SPOT, program trains officers to identify terrorists before they act by looking for passengers showing signs of stress, fear or deception. The Government Accountability Office investigated and said in a report this week there was no proof it works, and urged Congress to cut funding for it. Transportation Security Administration administrator John Pistole defended the program as an essential component of a web of protections. ""If we remove one whole layer of security, that being BDOs, who again are the least invasive and are looking for intent rather than items then that gives us an exposure to potential terrorists that we don't currently have,"" he said. Government report slams TSA program to spot possible terrorists . Behavior Detection Officers also operate a program called Managed Inclusion which evaluates passengers at the checkpoints and allows some to enter the faster Pre-Check lanes. ""Defunding the program is not the answer,"" Pistole said. ""There would be fewer passengers going through expedited screening, there would be increased pat downs, there would be longer lines, and more frustration by the traveling public."" The union representing TSA officers defended the program. ""An imperfect deterrent to terrorist attacks is better than no deterrent at all, "" said American Federation of Government Employees National President David Cox, speaking in a conference call after the hearing.  ""Is it a perfect program?  No, but until we have a better program, we shouldn't just trash and burn this program."" But some members of  the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee saw the Behavior Detection Officer program as troubling. ""We cannot continue to fund programs with the hope that they will work. We must prioritize limited funds for programs that have been proven effective,"" said Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, the committee's ranking Democratic member. House Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, praised the concept of detecting behavior, but worried the current operation may be flawed. ""I am concerned that TSA will continue to spin its wheels with this program instead of developing a more effective and efficient approach,"" he said. The hearing also focused on the recent shooting at Los Angeles International Airport where 23-year-old Paul Ciancia allegedly shot and killed TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez, and injured two others at a security checkpoint. Los Angeles World Airport Police were on site within four minutes and subsequently shot Ciancia. Administrator Pistole said agreements with local law enforcement on response times are being reviewed in wake of the incident. ""Under the aviation security program that TSA has with the (330 largest) airports, there is an agreed upon response time which is typically five minutes,"" he said. ""Clearly five minutes was too long in this case and that is something we are looking at as part of our review.

"A Swiss hostage abducted two years ago made a daring dawn escape Saturday  from Islamist extremists in the Philippines, the military said. During the escape, Lorenzo Vinciguerra, 49, seized one of his captor's bladed weapons and attacked a guard and a kidnapper,  said Col. Restituto Padilla, a spokesman for the Philippine military. Vinciguerra wounded the two and fled, prompting other  Abu Sayyaf rebels to shoot at him, Padilla told CNN affiliate 9TV.  He suffered a minor injury on his cheek. He fled while Philippine soldiers were conducting law enforcement operations in the area, Chester Ian Ramos, a local joint task force spokesman, told state-run Philippine News Agency. ""So the troops who were operating on the ground were able to recover him in that area of Barangay Timpook, where that incident happened, where they were operating,""  Padilla said. Ramons said he escaped about 5:20 a.m. local time. He was treated at a nearby base hospital for wounds that weren't life-threatening, authorities said. A second hostage, Dutchman Ewold Horn, 52, is still being held by the Abu Sayyaf  militant group.","Lorenzo Vinciguerra fled while soldiers conducted law enforcement operations .

"Nearly nine out of 10 people ""stopped and frisked"" under a controversial New York Police Department policy in 2011 were African-American or Hispanic. The data comes from a report released by the NYPD Monday, which showed that of the 685,724 stops made by police that year, 53% of those questioned were black, 34% were Latino, 9% were white and 3% were Asian. The citywide population in 2011 was 23.4% black, 29.4% Hispanic, 12.9% Asian, and 34.3% non-Hispanic white, according to the report. N.Y. judge halts 'stop-and-frisk' tactic outside Bronx building . Brooklyn's 75th precinct, which includes East New York and Cypress Hills, had the most ""stop and frisk"" incidents with 31,100.  Of those, 97% of the people involved were either black or Hispanic. The population in that precinct in 2011 was 53.5% black, 37.9% Hispanic, 5.1% Asian, and 3.5% white. The top reason for stop-and-frisks in 2011 was for suspicion of weapons possession, accounting for more than 25% of all stops. The much-criticized method, in which police stop, question and possibly search those they consider suspicious, is used to deter crime, the police department has said. But it has also brought on a slew of lawsuits by residents complaining of unlawful stops. Last year, amid mounting public pressure from advocacy groups, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly outlined new police policies in an effort to ""increase public confidence."" New York police tout improving crime numbers to defend frisking policy . Under the policies, officers report all ""stop and frisk"" encounters at a local level, and are provided training curriculum and videos, Kelly said. There are also programs reaching out to the community, he said. Kelly said at the time that the department prohibits racial profiling and aims to ensure a ""greater level of scrutiny"" by having captains of precincts ""personally conducting an audit of the Stop, Question and Frisk report worksheets that have been prepared within his or her command."" The NYPD report did not list how many of the stop-and-frisks resulted in arrests.","The New York Police Department releases figures on its ""stop and frisk"" policy .

"Turkey's lawmakers voted Thursday to authorize military force against the Islamic State terror group in Syria and Iraq, opening the door to cooperation with a U.S.-led coalition going after ISIS as its fighters laid siege to towns just south of the Turkish border. The Turkish Parliament voted 298-98 to not only to let the country's military leave its borders to go after ISIS and other terror groups, but also allow foreign troops to launch operations from Turkey. The authorization takes effect Saturday. It is a big shift for Turkey, a NATO member, which until now offered only tacit support to a U.S.-led coalition of about 40 nations going after ISIS in Iraq and Syria in various capacities. The mood of Turkey's leaders changed in recent days, with ISIS on the nation's doorstep and tens of thousands fleeing across its border. The Prime Minister asked Parliament to consider military action this week, submitting a motion declaring that Turkey was seriously threatened by the chaos in Syria and Iraq, where ISIS has captured land and is trying to establish an Islamic caliphate. For months, ISIS has been advancing, capturing portions of northern and eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq for what it says is its new Islamic state, or caliphate. The fighting has only intensified in the region in recent days, with ISIS advancing and nearly surrounding the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani, known in Arabic as Ayn al-Arab, just a few miles from the border with Turkey. If ISIS takes Kobani, it will control a complete swath of land from its self-declared capital of Raqqa on the Euphrates River to the Turkish border, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. Residents told to evacuate . Residents in Kobani were ordered to evacuate Thursday by the local defense force, the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG), as ISIS advanced on three fronts, seizing a number of villages just outside the city, Mustafa Abdi, a media activist in the city, told CNN. Abdi said he was waiting at the border at Mursitpinar with approximately 3,000 people waiting to cross into Turkey. Saroat Saeed, a university student, said he had made it across the border after waiting with what he said were the last civilians to leave Kobani. Only fighters trying to defend the city now remain, he said, but it is surrounded by ISIS and they face a dire situation. Alan Minbic, a YPG fighter, said Kobani had now been declared a military zone by the Kurdish force's leaders. ISIS has Kobani surrounded from three sides and its fighters are positioned very close to the city, he said. Kurdish snipers have taken up positions on high ground around the city but can expect ISIS shelling to try to dislodge them, he said. The YPG is now expecting ISIS to try to enter the city itself, Minbic said, adding that guerrilla warfare is the best chance for the defenders of Kobani because they hold the city and know it well. 'We are not afraid to die' Another YPG fighter who gave only his first name, Botan, said from Kobani that the Kurdish forces were determined to fight on. ""ISIS has surrounded us but we will fight, we are keeping our morale high,"" he said. ""We know, we have also seen, what ISIS is capable of, what brutality they can do. ... We know what they can do but we are not afraid to die, we are not afraid to fight. We know what will happen if ISIS takes over our town and what they will do to us."" The fighters will resist neighborhood by neighborhood, he said. ""Our fight is not just for the Kurds, it is a fight for all of humanity. When people are getting their heads chopped off and tossed aside like animals, it is a duty to fight."" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, said Thursday that clashes had been reported between YPG and ISIS fighters only a few hundred yards from the east and southeast of the city. ISIS militants have seized more than 350 villages in the past 16 days and displaced no fewer than 300,000 people from Kobani and the surrounding countryside, it said. Many have taken to social media to ask why there has been seemingly little attention by the United States and its coalition partners paid to helping the Kurdish fighters in Kobani hold off ISIS. On Twitter, people are using hashtags #ObamaHearKobani and #SaveKobani as part of an effort to raise the question. There was at least one airstrike near Kobani on Thursday by the coalition, according to the U.S. military. The strike targeted an ISIS checkpoint near the town, the military said. Turkey's decision on military action came a day after newly appointed NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg stressed at his first news conference that the defense alliance was committed to protecting Turkey if it comes under attack. Special forces deployed . A possible threat to an ancient tomb -- located in Syria but considered a Turkish enclave -- also appeared to be a factor in Turkey's decision to approve going after ISIS. Reports had emerged that ISIS surrounded  the tomb of the grandfather of the founder of the Ottoman Empire. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed reports that ISIS had surrounded the site. But the debate in Parliament mentioned  increasing security risks to the white marble mausoleum. As part of the Treaty of Ankara in 1921, which ended the Franco-Turkish War, Turkey was allowed to keep the tomb despite its location in Syria, to place guards at it and to raise a Turkish flag over it. Opinion: Will Turkish boots on ground really defeat ISIS? There have been conflicting reports in recent days about what has happened at the tomb and its guards, with some claims emerging that ISIS fighters briefly took the guards captive. It has also been widely reported that ISIS has had the tomb surrounded for months. So valued is the tomb said to contain the remains of Suleyman Shah -- grandfather of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire -- that Turkey deployed special forces soldiers in March when ISIS began to take villages and towns surrounding the tomb. Allen: 'Important moment' for anti-ISIS coalition . U.N. report details abuses . While Turkey approved the use of military action against ISIS, a new United Nations report outlined ""a staggering array"" of human rights abuses committed by ISIS in Iraq over a nine-week period, including executions, killings, rape and the desecration of religious sites. The report documents ""acts of violence of an increasingly sectarian nature"" by ISIS and associated armed groups and says their abuses appear to be widespread and systematic. From women reportedly being shot in the head for refusing to treat ISIS fighters, to the execution of Sunnis who refused to swear allegiance to ISIS, to the suicide bombing of a Shia mosque, it's a litany of horrors. Produced jointly by the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the report covers the period from July 6 to September 10, when ISIS was advancing across a swath of northern Iraq. The abuses ""include attacks directly targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, executions and other targeted killings of civilians, abductions, rape and other forms of sexual and physical violence perpetrated against women and children, forced recruitment of children, destruction or desecration of places of religious or cultural significance, wanton destruction and looting of property, and denial of fundamental freedoms,"" the report said.

"A naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia was convicted Thursday of plotting -- unsuccessfully -- to bomb a Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon, more than two years ago. A federal jury in Oregon capped a 14-day trial by finding Mohamed Osman Mohamud, 21, guilty of one count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, namely explosives. Mohamud is scheduled to be sentenced May 14. He faces up to life in prison and a $250,000 fine. ""When an individual concocts a plan to commit mass violence -- and is determined to follow through -- law enforcement has an obligation to take action to protect the public,"" said Lisa Monaco, a U.S. assistant attorney general. Mohamud was a 19-year-old Oregon State University student when he was arrested on November 26, 2010, for trying to blow up what he believed to be an explosives-laden van parked near a holiday event in Pioneer Courthouse Square, authorities said. The bomb -- which Mohamud described that day as ""beautiful,"" according to his arrest affidavit -- was actually fake, thanks to federal agents involved in the extensive undercover operation. Born in Mogadishu in 1991, Mohamud moved to the United States and became a naturalized U.S. citizen, settling in the northeastern Oregon city of Corvallis. Years before he enrolled at Oregon State University, he'd started thinking -- at age 15, according to the U.S. Justice Department -- of taking part in a violent jihad. In February 2009, he began exchanging the first of about 150 emails with Samir Khan, a now deceased al Qaeda member who published two online publications tied to the terrorist group, Jihad Recollections and Inspire. According to the Justice Department, Mohamud wrote several articles under assumed names for the former publication. The Oregon resident began communicating electronically in August 2009 with another accused terrorist, Amro Al-Ali. (Al-Ali is now being held in his native Saudi Arabia on terrorist charges, federal authorities said.) The two discussed Mohamud's possible travel first to Yemen, then to Pakistan's northwest frontier province, for terrorist training. ""Yes that would be wonderful, just tell me what I need to do,"" Mohamud wrote back in December 2009, the affidavit stated. That trip never happened, despite Mohamud's efforts to contact intermediaries to facilitate it. But he was reached in summer 2010 by a man who, unbeknownst to him, was an undercover FBI employee. ""Mohamud said that he wanted to become 'operational,'"" the affidavit said in describing Mohamud and the federal agents' conversations. The FBI probe moved to another level, including several discussions and trips involving Mohamud and undercover agents. On November 4, 2010, on the way back  from a trial run to a remote location to detonate a bomb, he was asked what he hoped would happen to those attending the Portland holiday ceremony, a family event that includes men, women and children. ""I want whoever is attending that event to leave ... either dead or injured,"" Mohamud said, the affidavit states. Having already canvassed to the area to find a spot to inflict the most casualties, Mohamud got what he believed to be a live bomb from the undercover agents. But the device was inert, and after his second attempt to detonate it, Mohamud was taken into custody. ""This trial provided a rare glimpse into the techniques al Qaeda employs to radicalize home-grown extremists,"" said Amanda Marshall, U.S. Attorney for Oregon. ""With the verdict today, the jury has held this defendant accountable.""","Mohamed Osman Mohamud said he wanted people to leave the lighting ""dead or injured,"" an affidavit says .

"(CNN) -- A growing pilot and passenger revolt over full-body scans and what many consider intrusive pat-downs couldn't have come at a worse time for the nation's air travel system. Thanksgiving, the busiest travel time of the year, is less than two weeks away. Grassroots groups are urging travelers to either not fly or to protest by opting out of the full-body scanners and undergo time-consuming pat-downs instead. Such concerns prompted a meeting Friday of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano with leaders of travel industry groups. Napolitano met with the U.S.Travel Association and 20 travel companies ""to underscore the Department's continued commitment to partnering with the nation's travel and tourism industry to facilitate the flow of trade and travel while maintaining high security standards to protect the American people,"" the department said in a statement. Federal officials have increased security in the wake of plots attributed to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Industry leaders are worried about the grassroots backlash to Transportation Security Administration security procedures. Some pilots, passengers and flight attendants have chosen to opt out of the revealing scans. More of the units are arriving at airports, with 1,000 expected to be in place by the end of 2011. ""While the meeting with Secretary Napolitano was informative, it was not entirely reassuring,"" the U.S. Travel Association said in a statement. ""We certainly understand the challenges that DHS confronts, but the question remains, 'where do we draw the line'? Our country desperately needs a long-term vision for aviation security screening, rather than an endless reaction to yesterday's threat,"" the statement said. ""At the same time, fundamental American values must be protected."" The travel industry is concerned that consumers may decide not to take a plane to Aunt Gertrude's for the holiday. ""We have received hundreds of e-mails and phone calls from travelers vowing to stop flying,"" Geoff Freeman, an executive vice president of the U.S. Travel Association, told Reuters. A 2008 survey found that air travelers ""avoided"" 41 million trips because they believed the air travel system was either ""broken"" or in need of ""moderate correction,"" the U.S. Travel Association said. The decisions cost airlines $9.4 billion, the survey said. One online group, ""National Opt Out Day"" calls for a day of protest against the scanners on Wednesday, November 24, the busiest travel day of the year. Another group argues the TSA should remove the scanners from all airports. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a non-profit privacy advocacy group, is taking legal action, saying the TSA should be required to conduct a public rule-making to evaluate the privacy, security and health risks caused by the body scanners. Pilots' unions for US Airways and American Airlines are urging their members to avoid full-body scanning at airport security checkpoints, citing health risks and concerns about intrusiveness and security officer behavior. ""Pilots should NOT submit to AIT (Advanced Imaging Technology) screening,"" wrote Capt. Mike Cleary, president of the U.S. Airline Pilots Association, in a letter to members this week. USAPA represents more than 5,000 US Airways pilots. ""Based on currently available medical information, USAPA has determined that frequent exposure to TSA-operated scanner devices may subject pilots to significant health risks,"" Cleary wrote. Napolitano told industry leaders that biometric identification, such as retinal scanning and thorough background checks will expedite the screening of 80,000 passengers who participate in ""trusted traveler"" programs, the department said. In a blog posting this week, the TSA said pat-downs ""have long been one of the many security measures TSA and virtually every other nation has used in its risk-based approach to help detect hidden and dangerous items such as explosives like the one we saw in the failed terrorist attack last Christmas Day."" The agency said only a small percentage of passengers end up needing a pat-down. ""There's nothing punitive about it; it just makes good security sense,"" the blog post reads. ""And the weapons and other dangerous and prohibited items we've found during pat-downs speak to this."" But the chorus against the security measures is getting louder. The website ""We Won't Fly"" urgers travelers to ""Act now. Travel with Dignity."" ""We are opposed to the full-body backscatter X-ray airport scanners on grounds of health and privacy. We do not consent to strip searches, virtual or otherwise. We do not wish to be guinea pigs for new, and possibly dangerous, technology. We are not criminals. We are your customers. We will not beg the government anymore. We will simply stop flying until the porno-scanners are history,"" the site says. ""National Opt Out Day,"" organized by Brian Sodegren, encourages solidarity on November 24, amid the crush of Thanksgiving travelers. ""It's the day ordinary citizens stand up for their rights, stand up for liberty, and protest the federal government's desire to virtually strip us naked or submit to an ""enhanced pat-down"" that touches people's breasts and genitals. You should never have to explain to your children, 'Remember that no stranger can touch or see your private area, unless it's a government employee, then it's OK.' "" According to the group, passengers who say ""I opt out"" when told to go through body scanners are submitted to a pat-down. ""Be sure to have your pat-down by TSA in full public -- do not go to the back room when asked. Every citizen must see for themselves how the government treats law-abiding citizens,"" the website says. The Facebook page of the group includes a litany of complaints about the scanners. ""I'm completely appalled by this,"" one woman wrote. ""What happened to our right to privacy? Has Homeland Security forgotten our rights because they think its going to stop terrorists?"" Meanwhile, the Council on American-Islamic Relations has issued its own travel advisory over pat-downs many ""describe as invasive and humiliating."" Muslim women who wear a hijab and are selected for secondary screening because of a head scarf should remind TSA officers ""that they are only supposed to pat down the area in question, in this scenario, your head and neck. They should not subject you to a full-body or partial-body pat-down,"" the group said. The TSA has deployed nearly 350 advanced imaging technology (body scanner) units in nearly 70 U.S. airports, administrator John Pistole said recently. ""By the end of calendar year 2011, we plan to have deployed approximately 1,000 units."" The agency is exploring enhancements to the technology. ""This capability would make screening more efficient and would eliminate most privacy concerns about the technology,"" Pistole said. Privacy concerns aren't the only reason for protests. Some scientists and two major airline pilots unions contend not enough is known about the effects of the small doses of X-ray radiation emitted by one of the two types of airport scanning machines. The Transportation Security Administration's advanced imaging technology machines use two separate means of creating images of passengers -- backscatter X-ray technology and millimeter-wave technology. While the TSA says the machines are safe, backscatter technology raises concerns among some because it uses small doses of ionizing radiation. The use of millimeter-wave technology hasn't received the same attention, and radiation experts say it poses no known health risks. The risk of harmful radiation exposure from backscatter scans is very small, according to David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University and a professor of radiation biophysics. The TSA says the technology has been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.

"She's the second consecutive New York beauty queen to take the Miss America title, but she's the first Indian-American to wear the national crown -- er, tiara -- atop her perfectly coiffed head.

"Iraqi security forces have regained control of the area of Jurf al-Sakhar, a town south of Baghdad, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said Saturday, as they battle to keep ISIS militants in check. In a post on Facebook, al-Abadi saluted the efforts made by Iraqi forces to liberate the area and said they ""have inflicted a strong blow to the terrorist organization ISIS."" Jurf al-Sakhar is on the outskirts of Hilla and is a mixed Sunni-Shiite area. The town was also the site of intense fighting in June between Iraqi forces and ISIS over the control of a military facility, where an infantry brigade is based, Iraqi security officials said. Farther north, Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces have liberated the northern Iraqi town of Zumar, west of the Mosul Dam, and its surroundings, according to the ruling party of the Kurdish Regional Government and Iraqi state TV. ""Zumar is controlled by the Peshmerga forces. ISIS completely evacuated it,"" Sheikh Ahmad Mohammad, a Peshmerga commander, told Kurdish news agency Rudaw. Specialized teams subsequently moved into the town to defuse all rigged homes and booby traps that ISIS left behind, Peshmerga operations commander in Mosul Sa'eed Mamzayn told CNN. Peshmerga forces also regained control of 10 villages around Zumar and killed 81 ISIS fighters, Heman Hawrami, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party Foreign Relations Office, said via Twitter. Airstrikes pummel ISIS . The U.S. military said 10 coalition airstrikes had been carried out against ISIS forces Friday and Saturday west of the Mosul Dam, destroying five ISIS units, a building used by the group and several fighting positions. Another coalition airstrike struck a large ISIS unit southeast of the Mosul Dam, according to the U.S. Central Command. Altogether, 22 airstrikes have targeted the Sunni extremist group in Iraq since Friday. ISIS took control of Zumar back in August when Peshmerga troops were forced to pull out after being surrounded by ISIS militants and being isolated from any support, Kurdistan Democratic Party regional official Ismat Rajab told CNN. Kobani awaits Peshmerga reinforcements . News of the reported gains against ISIS in Iraq comes as Kurdish forces in Syria continue to battle ISIS for control of the Kurdish town of Kobani, known in Arabic as Ayn al-Arab. Clashes could be heard in the border town Saturday, but the Kurdish defenders appear to be holding their ground against ISIS as the militants seek to regain territory. There's been heavy fighting this week around Tal Shair, a strategic hill to the west of Kobani, as well as to the south and east of the city. Turkey has said it will allow Kurdish Peshmerga forces from Iraq to pass through its territory into Syria to join the fight for Kobani, which lies on the Syrian-Turkish border. Saleh Muslim, chair of the PYD, a Kurdish poitical party in northern Syria, told CNN that the Peshmerga and his party finalized their pact Friday night and fighters could enter Kobani Saturday evening or Sunday. The precise timing is unclear and dependent on part on Turkish permission, he said, adding that the armed wing of the PYD may also influence the timing in Kobani, the site of fierce fighting. As many as 150 fighters could be allowed in, but it's not yet clear exactly how many or when the reinforcements will arrive. One fighter in Kobani told CNN they could come as soon as Saturday night. There was one U.S. airstrike in Syria from Friday to Saturday, against an ISIS artillery piece near Kobani, U.S. Central Command said.","Official: Peshmerga clear booby traps from once ISIS-occupied Iraqi town .

"Stephen Slevin's 22 months in solitary confinement in a county jail left him traumatized and physically weak, but he'll soon be a multimillionaire for his suffering. The New Mexico county that locked him up on a drunk driving charge, isolated him from other inmates and accused of essentially forgetting about him for nearly two years agreed this week to settle his lawsuit for $15.5 million. Slevin, now 59, went to jail in August 2005 as ""a well nourished, physically healthy adult,"" but emerged with a long beard, bed sores, bad teeth and weighing just 133 pounds in June 2007, according to the lawsuit. Jailers separated Slevin from other inmates because of his history of mental illness, according to the lawsuit filed by Albuquerque civil rights attorney Matthew Coyte in December 2008. The charges of driving while intoxicated and receiving a stolen vehicle were never prosecuted. ""They threw him in solitary and then ignored him,"" said Coyte a year ago after a federal jury awarded Slevin $22 million. ""He disappeared into delirium, and his mental illness was made worse by being isolated from human contact and a lack of medical care."" Slevin suffers from post-traumatic stress from what he called physical and mental mistreatment by corrections officials in Dona Ana County, which shares a border with Mexico in the southern part of the state. The county's commissioners agreed this week to drop their appeal of the jury's verdict in return for Slevin accepting the lesser amount. ""The Board of County Commissioners deeply regrets the harm Mr. Slevin suffered during this period,"" the county said in a statement Thursday. ""Over the past seven years, Dona Ana County has made significant improvements to detention center staffing, training, facilities and procedures. Dona Ana County is committed to ensuring consistent and appropriate treatment of every detainee in its care."" Slevin's lawsuit alleged he became malnourished, lost significant weight, developed bedsores, fungus and dental problems and was not aware of his situation or surroundings. He was transferred to another state facility for two weeks, given a psychiatric evaluation and then sent back to the Dona Ana County Detention Center, where he was again placed in solitary confinement. Coyte said Slevin did receive a brief competency hearing a year into his imprisonment, but the case against the man never proceeded. After 22 months as a pretrial detainee, Slevin was released and the charges dismissed. He then filed suit, claiming his rights of due process were violated since he was not given a hearing before being placed in solitary confinement. Photos taken before and after his confinement show dramatic appearance changes. The plaintiff said things were so bad he was forced to pull his own tooth while in custody, and that his pleas for help were dismissed. In pretrial motions, the county denied ""that there was lack of medical care. For most of the other allegations, officials either denied them or said they were ""without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief"" of the veracity of the claims. Coyte told CNN he and Slevin hope their victory would ""help bring a stop to the use of solitary confinement in America. Other countries recognize it as a form of torture, whereas America uses it as a routine method of incarceration."" ""The families and friends of the people who have been subjected to this barbaric treatment know what we are talking about,"" Coyte wrote in an e-mail.  ""They see the effects of it every day. Hopefully Stephen's story can make a difference to them and others who are currently sitting in a concrete cell 23 hours a day."" The county said it has taken ""bold steps"" to improve the 846-bed jail, which it said would make it ""the model for detention centers and the care of the mentally ill in the state of New Mexico."" ""In the wake of this large settlement, we can say definitively that we have learned from the past,"" its statement said. ""We can also say with confidence that we are leading the way for the future."" Slevin continues to have serious medical issues, and is fighting lung cancer, his lawyer said. ""Stephen is optimistic in his ongoing battle with cancer and is doing as well as can be expected while undergoing some pretty difficult treatments,"" Coyte wrote. ""Mentally, he will always suffer the effects of his inhumane treatment at the hands of Dona Ana County. The money can never replace what they took from him.""","""They threw him in solitary and then ignored him"" for 22 months, Stephen Slevin's lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- A Seattle, Washington, police officer who was caught on video punching an alleged jaywalker did nothing wrong, the Seattle Police Officers Guild said. Seattle police are reviewing the incident, which was caught on a witness's cell phone camera, a department spokesman said. Police officials originally said that Officer Ian Walsh had been sent to a training unit to review police tactics, but later said that the officer was not reassigned, Detective Mark Jamieson told CNN. Walsh, who joined the force in November 2007, has not been disciplined in the Monday incident, which remains under investigation, Jamieson said. The event has been referred to the department's Office of Professional Accountability for review, he said. ""The officer did nothing wrong. We always will review incidents like this, that's how police officers learn,"" Sgt. Rich O'Neill, president of the Seattle Police Officer's Guild, told CNN. ""I am confident that the review will show that the officer was totally justified. He was defending himself."" According to a police statement, Walsh was on patrol and in uniform Monday afternoon when he stopped a young man for jaywalking. While interacting with the man, Walsh observed four women jaywalking at the same location and ordered them to step over to his cruiser, police said. The department described the women as being ""verbally antagonistic toward the officer."" One of the women began to walk away and appeared to raise her hand in a dismissive gesture after being ordered to step over to the car, police said. Walsh escorted the woman back to the cruiser, but she then started to yell at him and pull away, ""breaking free of the officer's grip several times,"" police said. When the officer tried to handcuff the woman, another woman placed her hands on the officer's arm, police said. ""The officer pushed the second subject back, but she again came at the officer, at which time he punched her,"" police said. O'Neill forcefully defended Walsh's actions. ""The focus needs to be on the two individuals,"" O'Neill said. ""If you watch the entire video, he is trying to de-escalate the situation, first by voice commands, then by taking her by the wrists, and then she reacts by pulling away and swinging. ""My critique is that he could have used more force and taken the girl to the ground,"" O'Neill said. ""He could have grabbed her, it's called a leg sweep, handcuffed her and it would have been over a lot faster, but when you take someone to the ground you risk more injury."" The 19-year-old woman who allegedly grabbed Walsh's arm was booked for investigation of assault on an officer, police said. The other woman, who police said was 17, was booked for obstructing an officer. Both suspects were also cited for jaywalking.","NEW: Officer did nothing wrong, officers guild says .

"I don't trust cops and I don't know many black people who do. I respect them. I sympathize with them. I am appreciative of the work they do. But when you've been pulled over for no good reason as many times as I have; when you've been in handcuffs for no good reason as many times as I have; when you run out to buy some allergy medication and upon returning home, find yourself surrounded by four squad cars with flashing lights and all you can think about is how not to get shot, you learn not to trust cops. The first instance of injustice surrounding the Trayvon Martin tragedy occurred February 26, the night George Zimmerman decided to pursue, confront and ultimately shoot and kill Martin. The second started the moment the Sanford police failed to properly investigate what, given the 911 tapes, is clearly a questionable claim of self-defense made by Zimmerman. But seeing that Martin's parents were forced to sue the police department just to hear the tapes, it seems as if Zimmerman isn't the only questionable component in this case. Thursday, Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee stepped down ""temporarily.""  On Wednesday, Sanford city commissioners had voted ""no confidence"" in him. Opinion: What every black mother fears . But at a town hall meeting hosted by the NAACP on Tuesday, Sanford's black residents said they lost confidence in the police long before because of the extensive history of prejudicial treatment in the area. Law enforcement isn't easy. In fact, it is extremely dangerous. But that in no way excuses improper procedure and lies. And given the amount of effort put forth by the Sanford chief to exonerate Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watchman with a history of 911 calls that suggests paranoia, versus efforts to find out the truth, it sure feels like another case of racial profiling and police trying to cover up an impropriety. The shooter may not have been a police officer, but the story of how the police handled this case is oh-so-familiar. It's the same story the nation heard from blacks in Los Angeles surrounding the 1991 Rodney King beating. It's the same story heard from blacks in New York City surrounding the murder of Amadou Diallo, who was only carrying his wallet when he was shot 41 times by four plainclothes policemen in 1999. Opinion: How ""duty to retreat"" became ""stand your ground"" That same story was heard in New Orleans, where black men were shot and killed for sport by police officers off  the Danziger Bridge in 2005. The police department covered it up for two years before any arrests were made. Charges were even initially dismissed by the district judge before the Justice Department got involved and finally, last summer, officers were convicted. And people wonder where the impetus behind NWA's ""___ the Police"" came from. I'll tell you where it came from.  It came from knowing  there are far more stories like Trayvon Martin's that the world never hears about. In fact, we almost didn't hear about this one. The nation heard the 911 tapes from last month's tragic shooting at Chardon High School in Ohio within 24 hours of the incident. Martin's parents had to file a lawsuit before they could hear the ones in this case. Why? If the  police department had done everything it was supposed to do, if it was truly ""PROHIBITED from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time"" as the letter released by the city manager states, then why hold back until there is national media attention? Opinion: Killing shows flaws of NRA-backed law . The letter said the department was still investigating the case and didn't want to compromise it, but the authorities never brought Zimmerman in for questioning. They still haven't. They tested Martin's body for drugs and alcohol, but not Zimmerman's. The only person with a weapon was Zimmerman. Martin was unarmed. Just like the victims in New Orleans, Diallo, King. ... In 2010, the family of Sean Bell was awarded $7 million by the city of New York after five police officers sprayed his car with more than 50 bullets, killing him. He was unarmed and to be married the next day. ""No amount of money can provide closure, no amount of money can make up for the pain,"" his fiancee, Nicole Paultre Bell, said after the ruling. ""We'll just try to learn how to live with it and move on.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The global financial crisis has increased the worldwide trade in trafficked persons, says a State Department report released Tuesday. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says the report aims ""to shine the light brightly on ... modern slavery."" The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report also says trafficking has increased in Africa and slaps six African nations on a blacklist of countries not meeting the minimum standard of combating trafficking. The report, mandated by Congress, features data and statistics from 175 countries around the world regarding the amount of human trafficking that goes on within their borders. The report cites the International Labor Organization, which estimates that at least 12.3 million adults and children are victims of forced labor, bonded labor and sex slavery each year. ""This is modern slavery. A crime that spans the globe, providing ruthless employers with endless supply of people to abuse for financial gain,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said as she announced the report. ""With this report, we hope to shine the light brightly on the scope and scale of modern slavery, so all governments can see where progress has been made and where more is needed."" The report says the global economic crisis is boosting the demand for human trafficking because of a growing demand for cheap goods and services. ""A striking global demand for labor and a growing supply of workers willing to take ever greater risks for economic opportunities seem a recipe for increased forced labor cases of migrant workers and women in prostitution,"" it says. It predicts that the economic crisis will push more businesses underground to avoid taxes and unionized labor, which will increase the use of forced, cheap and child labor by cash-strapped multinational companies. African countries Nigeria and Mauritius are praised in the report for making strong efforts to combat trafficking. But six African nations -- Chad, Eritrea, Mauritania, Niger, Swaziland and Zimbabwe -- were put on the report's ""Tier 3"" blacklist of countries whose efforts to combat trafficking are inadequate. Most of the countries are ""source"" and ""destination"" countries, the report says, meaning trafficking victims both come from and are sent there. Most are trafficked throughout Africa, but many end up in the Middle East, it says. Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria remain on the blacklist for another year, with the report saying they often become a destination for trafficked persons who are sold into domestic servitude. Other repeat offenders on the list include North Korea, Myanmar and Fiji. The State Department also put Malaysia in the Tier 3 list, because of its trafficking of Burmese refugees. The report cites information that Malaysian immigration officials sold refugees to traffickers operating along its border with Thailand. When the victims were unable to pay a ransom demanded by the traffickers, the report says, they were sold for labor and commercial sex exploitation. The blacklisted countries are subject to U.S. sanctions if they don't make greater efforts to fight trafficking. The Philippines, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Pakistan were added to a ""watch list"" because of what the report calls a worsening trafficking record in those countries. The 52 countries on the watch list have failed to to meet the minimum anti-trafficking standards but are making efforts to do so. For the first time, countries that have been on the watch list for two years -- including China, Russia, India, Sri Lanka and Egypt -- will automatically be moved to the Tier 3 blacklist next year without a presidential waiver if they fail improve their trafficking record, the State Department said. This year, the Justice Department also put out a report on U.S. efforts to combat trafficking efforts at home. In 2008, the FBI opened 132 trafficking investigations, made 139 arrests and obtained 94 convictions. Clinton invited to Tuesday's event members of Congress who are active on the issue, as well as global advocates for trafficking victims, in an effort to give the issue a higher profile and shine a spotlight on the need to combat it. Calling for a renewed worldwide partnership between countries and non-governmental organizations to combat trafficking, Clinton said, ""Trafficking thrives in the shadows, and it can be easy to dismiss it as something that happens to someone else, somewhere else. But that's not the case. ""Trafficking is a crime that involves every nation on Earth, and that includes our own,"" she said, calling trafficking a ""grave problem"" in the United States. For the first time, she said, the United States next year will rank its own efforts at combating trafficking along with the rest of the world. She expressed hope that it will be on the Tier 1 list of countries that are making robust efforts.","State Department report cites higher demand for cheap goods and services .

"Editor's note: Leonard Pitts Jr., a columnist for the Miami Herald, won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for commentary and is the author of a new novel, ""Before I Forget"" and of ""Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to Fatherhood."" Leonard Pitts says neither the black nor white yardsticks on race present the full picture. (CNN) -- They're not going to like this. Indeed, one suspects the National Urban League's recently released 2009 State of Black America report quantifying racial inequities in employment, housing, education, criminal justice, health and other arenas will be about as welcome as graffiti on the Lincoln Memorial among those Americans who convinced themselves in November the country had entered a ""post-racial"" era. Those Americans will be overwhelmingly white and will resist with mighty determination the report's implicit argument: that we have not yet overcome, not yet reached the Promised Land, not yet come to a point where race is irrelevant, Barack Obama notwithstanding. Years spent engaging Americans on the knotty conundrums of race leave me confident in that prediction. So does a 2008 Gallup poll in which 46 percent of non-Hispanic whites said there is no widespread racism against blacks. But it took a Yale University study to help me understand why some whites feel that way. Psychology professor Richard Eibach was reported last year in the Washington Post as having found that in judging racial progress, white people and black ones tend to use different yardsticks. Whites use the yardstick of how far we have come from the nation we used to be. Blacks use the yardstick of how far we have yet to go to be the nation we ought to be. The most complete picture, of course, requires both measures. But who can be surprised that blacks and whites each tend to gravitate toward the measure that is most forgiving of their individual groups, that shoves the onus for change off on the other? The black yardstick, after all, leaves black people no obligation other than to demand justice and equality from white people. The white yardstick requires of white people only that they exhort black people to become more self-reliant and take more responsibility for their own problems. But what if you are an American who realizes there is no either/or here, no need to buy into a false dichotomy that requires you to choose one yardstick over the other? Then you might understand the National Urban League report as what it is: a valuable document we do not have the luxury of dismissing. And yet, at the same time, a document that presents an incomplete prescription for the uplift of African America. African-Americans do not, after all, need its policy suggestions to fix many of their most intractable problems. We do not need a government program to turn off the TV, realizing it's hardly coincidental that people who watch more television per capita have poorer academic performance. We do not need federal monies to tell our children to wait until they are married or, at the very least, in stable, long-term relationships, before they bring babies into the world. We do not need Washington's input to know we must quit allowing our community to be defined by a coarse popular culture whose words and images are indistinguishable from the Ku Klux Klan's. And yet... Once you've turned off the television and encouraged black children toward academic excellence, you still must contend with the fact that their schools are too often crumbling, underfunded and staffed with inexperienced teachers. Once you've gotten black women and men to raise their children in the context of families, you still have to deal with the fact that those families need places to live, jobs to support them and doctors to keep them healthy, all of it elusive as long as structural discrimination persists in all those areas. And, once you have convinced black children to stop defining themselves by denigrating stereotypes, you still have to fix a racially biased justice system that treats them as crimes waiting to happen. Make no mistake: There is value in the yardstick white Americans use. Not to acknowledge the progress black people have made and the need to fix those things that are within our power would be ridiculous. But there is value in the yardstick black Americans use, too, the measure the National Urban League provides in its annual studies. To resist or dismiss this truth, to pretend these inequities are a thing of the past, is to make yourself part of the problem. We have not yet reached the Promised Land and we all have a moral responsibility toward that goal. But before we can fulfill that responsibility, we must learn to speak the same language where race is concerned, and to mean the same things when we do. And here, it is worth noting another of Eibach's findings. Namely, that while black people see reaching ""the Promised Land"" as a real and urgent necessity, white ones tend to regard it as an ideal, something it might be nice to achieve someday. Of course, it's easy for them to say that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leonard Pitts Jr.","Leonard Pitts: Whites want to view race in terms of progress blacks have made .
He says blacks view race as the distance it will take them to achieve equality .
He says neither picture is complete and it will take both to reach desired goal .

"With negotiations for a longer-lasting cease-fire set to begin soon, many Gazans returned to their neighborhoods Tuesday while some remained at shelters not trusting the break in the violence. For now, a 72-hour humanitarian pause is in place, allowing delegations to gather in Cairo, Egypt, to talk about how to make the truce last. For Gaza's 1.8 million residents it also offered a chance to go to a street market for food and goods, or to check on abandoned homes. For Israel, where more than 2,300 rockets have landed since early July, there was, for a change, no sirens blaring. In Gaza City, one man told CNN he was happy the shooting had stopped, but his problems were just beginning. The man said he couldn't understand what he was seeing -- the home his family invested $100,000 in, now destroyed. No insurance company will give him money to rebuild, he told CNN. There are no winners in this war, he said. But on Twitter, the Israel Defense Forces declared: ""Mission accomplished."" The IDF said it had destroyed 32 tunnels -- many of which ran under the border into Israel -- during the four-week conflict. Israel says Hamas militants used the tunnels to sneak into Israel for terror attacks. Nearly 1,900 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the conflict, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. It's unclear how many were militants. The United Nations estimates that about 70% of the dead were civilians. But the IDF says it estimates about 900 militants were killed. IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said it was a preliminary figure based on field reports from troops returning from battle. Israeli officials have said 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel died in violence. 'Peace? What peace?' After the cease-fire began, residents trickled into Shujaya, an area near Gaza City that experienced some of the most destructive violence of the conflict. They found craters and ruins where homes and shops once stood. People scaled crumbled concrete and twisted metal to rummage for any belongings left in the rubble. Nal Mohammed, a Ph.D. student whose family home was demolished, lamented the situation. ""Peace? What peace? We have no home, no water, no power,"" he said. ""There is no peace here."" Residents were stunned as they returned to their neighborhoods for the first time since being displaced by the fighting. ""After the cease-fire agreement took effect, the world will now see the level of destruction which should serve as an evidence of the level of crimes of the enemy,"" Ismail Haniyeh, a senior leader of Hamas, said in a statement aired on Hamas-run Al-Aqsa television, according to a CNN translation. The conflict has displaced more than 200,000 people across the densely populated territory. Residents are coming back to similar sights -- rubble, ruins, buildings pockmarked by shrapnel. A white-haired man, Hany Mahmoud el Harezen, stood on the roof of his collapsed two-story home. ""I am a wedding photographer, I have nothing to do with this war,"" he said. ""Maybe if we had gotten some concessions, it would be worth it. But we got nothing."" For the first time Tuesday, the number of people packed into U.N. shelters decreased, said U.N. official Chris Gunness in Gaza. But not everyone left the U.N. facilities. Others were more pragmatic, thinking it best to wait and see. ""They said there was a truce before and we left,"" one man told CNN. ""But five minutes after we got home, the airstrikes started."" Israel released a map noting numerous sites it targeted in Shujaya, which it said ""Hamas used for military purposes."" The IDF said the map showed locations of tunnels, hideouts, rocket firings and launchings, and more. Troop withdrawal . ""We have no forces within Gaza,"" IDF spokesman Lerner told CNN Tuesday. With its goal of demolishing the tunnels achieved, Israel announced the withdrawal of ground forces for what is supposed to be a three-day cease-fire with Hamas. Israel is implementing the Egyptian-brokered truce, which took effect Tuesday morning, while maintaining ""defensive positions"" outside Gaza, the IDF said. Officials from the United Nations and United States, who have been pushing for a cease-fire for weeks, hope that the 72-hour pause will allow negotiations to take place for a more lasting peace. Why are so many civilians dying in Hamas-Israel war? Meetings in Cairo . An Israeli delegation arrived Tuesday evening in Cairo for negotiations, two senior Egyptian government officials told CNN. The officials, who asked not to be named, said they expected indirect negotiations to begin Wednesday, with the Egyptian officials acting as intermediaries. The two sides are not expected to talk directly to each other. Egyptian and Palestinian negotiators had arrived over the weekend. Key to any talks, Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said, is that Hamas must disarm. Hamas leaders say that they want to negotiate an end to the Israeli blockade of Gaza, or at least a body other than the Israelis controlling the borders. Haniyeh, the senior Hamas leader, said his televised statement that Hamas members will work with the Palestinian delegation to end the blockade. Israel: 'The onus is on Hamas' Israel repeatedly accepted an Egyptian cease-fire proposal during the conflict, which Hamas rejected. Temporary humanitarian cease-fires repeatedly crumbled, with each side blaming the other. ""The onus is on Hamas,"" Regev told CNN of the 72-hour truce. ""We are entering this with our eyes open,"" he said. ""We have been burnt more than once."" The sentiment was similar from Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan, who told CNN that as long as Israel honors the agreement, so will the Palestinians. ""We hope they can take it and be committed to a cease-fire,"" he said. While Egypt has not released details of the truce, Regev suggested it was the same agreement that Israel has accepted all along. The United States urged both sides to honor the cease-fire agreement. ""The United States has been steadfast in our insistence on an end to rocket and tunnel attacks against Israel and an end to the suffering of the people of Gaza,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon ""urges the parties to commence, as soon as possible, talks in Cairo on a durable ceasefire and the underlying issues,"" his office said in a statement. British minister resigns over Gaza . In the latest example of the ripples the conflict has sent around the globe, a British government minister said she was resigning over her country's policy on Gaza. ""With deep regret I have this morning written to the Prime Minister & tendered my resignation. I can no longer support Govt policy on Gaza,"" Sayeeda Warsi, senior minister of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, wrote on Twitter. Warsi, a member of the House of Lords and the first Muslim in a British Cabinet, posted a photo of her resignation letter on Twitter.","Israeli, Palestinian delegations in Cairo with Egyptian officials to act as go-betweens .

"(CNN)New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie again insisted he hasn't yet decided whether to run for president, but his family won't be able to veto him if he does decide to jump in the race. He added, however, what his family thinks about the prospect ""matters deeply to me."" ""And just as importantly, what the potential impact would be on each and every one of them is something that weighs enormously on me, "" he said during his monthly ""Ask the Governor"" radio show. Could Chris Christie be bullied out of 2016? The New Jersey governor said that ""just this morning as I was getting ready for work"" he was thinking about how his youngest daughter, 11-year-old Bridget, would be affected by a run. Christie said he's asking himself three questions: ""Is it right for me, is it right for my family, is it right for the country â€”Â in that order."" ""I'll decide,"" on the answer to those questions, he said, ""and then after that I'll make the decision about when to let everyone know."" Christie has repeatedly said he hasn't made up his mind on 2016, but has made no secret of his interest and his supporters are moving to build the operation he'll need if he does decide to jump in the race. Allies of the governor are in the early stages of starting a leadership political action committee that would serve as an apparatus for him to travel and to hire staff, CNN confirmed earlier this month. During his Thursday evening radio show appearance, Christie wouldn't confirm that those plans were underway. ""There's lots of people making lots of suggestions to me ... There's a whole bunch of different options on the table, but I haven't made any final decision about what to do,"" he said. 'Huggable Christie previews presidential road map . With former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announcing last month plans to ""actively explore"" a run, and 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney telling donors and supporters he's seriously considering it, Christie's path to the nomination looks to have narrowed, as both Bush and Romney would vie for the same universe of establishment-minded donors and voters as Christie. But Christie made clear that the rest of the field will have no bearing on his eventual decision. ""'I'm not gonna allow other people to dictate to me my time frame,"" he said. Christie has said before that running against Bush would be ""stressful"" because ""you don't like to run against people who are your friends."" The New Jersey governor helped raise money for George W. Bush's 2000 bid, and Bush later appointed him U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. But Christie said on Thursday night he felt even if the two ran against each other, ""I don't think that means it has to end a relationship."" ""Friends have run against each other before though ... it's just the way it goes,"" he said. ""If Jeb decides ultimately to run and I decide ultimately to run â€” I hope that what we could do is to run based upon  our particular visions for the country and for our party, and may the best person win."" Indeed, Christie invited the wide-open primary fight that's developing, arguing that ""if it's a smart, respectful, substantive debate, that's good for the party."" ""To the extent that it becomes difficult and divisive, it depends on how those people who are on the receiving end of that deals with it,"" he said.","New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he hasn't yet decided whether to run for president .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Officials say two men in Iran have been stoned to death for adultery and murder, while another escaped death by digging his way out of the hole where he was buried to face a similar fate, according to media reports. The sentences follow sharp criticism by human rights groups of Iran's use of such punishments. Judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi on Tuesday told reporters about the stonings, which took place in the northeastern city of Mashhad about 20 days ago, the reports said. According to the Mashhad prosecutor, the men committed various crimes, including adultery and murder, Jamshidi said. In the practice, the men are buried up to their chests and people pelt them with stones until they die. A third was supposed to have been stoned to death. However, he freed himself by climbing out of the stone hole. He still awaits punishment. ""Stoning is a horrific practice, designed to increase the suffering of those facing execution, and it has no place in the modern world,"" Amnesty International said last year. Jamshidi said Iran's judiciary chief, Ayatollah Heshemi Shahroudi, had made recommendations that would ban the practice and said that a measure has been introduced in Parliament to stop the punishment. But ""until this measure is approved and becomes law, the judges have the independence not to pay heed to the recommendations of the Judiciary chief,"" Jamshidi said. Amnesty said in a report last year that Iran's penal code allows execution by stoning as the penalty for adultery. The group said the law calls for stones ""large enough to cause pain, but not so large as to kill the victim immediately."" In August, Amnesty International issued a statement welcoming an announcement that stoning had been suspended and several women had their sentences commuted. In that announcement, the group said at least one stoning execution was carried out in 2007 in Qazvin province and a woman and a man were known to have been stoned to death in Mashhad in May 2006. ""The majority of those sentenced to death by stoning are women. Women are not treated equally with men under the law and by courts, and they are also particularly vulnerable to unfair trials because their higher illiteracy rate makes them more likely to sign confessions to crimes they did not commit,"" Amnesty said. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","Officials say two men in Iran stoned to death for adultery and murder .

"Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina is known as a humble man, a capable administrator and -- as expected of a new pope -- a man of great faith. Those and other qualities will be put to the test as he embarks on his most historic role yet. Cardinal Bergoglio elected pope . On Wednesday, cardinals elected Bergoglio to be the first non-European pope in the modern era. He is the first pontiff from South America, and the first Jesuit to be elected head of the Roman Catholic Church. ""The new pope is a very humble man,"" said the Rev. Eduardo Mangiarotti, an Argentine priest. ""He takes public transport every day. He is a strongly devoted man to the poorest and suffering people in his dioceses. He is a passionate preacher and a man of prayer."" At the same time, Mangiarotti described Bergoglio, who will be called Pope Francis in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, as a man of action, and someone who can command attention. 5 things to know about Pope Francis . ""When he preaches, he's a man who can make the people listen to him. And not only Catholic people, I mean not only the people who belong to the church, but he's also very known nationwide. The people in our country really know him and also look up to him --- the way he addresses issues regarding social justice, education, our own identify as a nation,"" Mangiarotti said. In his first public act, the new pope broke with tradition by asking the estimated 150,000 people packed into St. Peter's Square to pray for him, rather than bless the crowd first. ""He is a very simple man,"" said Luis R. Zarama, auxiliary bishop of Atlanta. ""It's very clear from the way he approached the people and asked them to bless him and pray for him. It's a beautiful sign of closeness and humility."" A voice for the poor . Francis, 76, was born in Buenos Aires on December 17, 1936. The son of an Italian immigrant, he trained as a chemist before deciding to become a priest. He was ordained by the Jesuits in 1969 and became co-archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1997, sole archbishop of that city one year later. He was made a cardinal in 2001 and served as president of the Argentine bishops conference from 2005-11. As cardinal, Francis clashed with the government of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives. Pope's name choice 'precedent shattering' He was runner-up in the 2005 papal conclave, behind then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, according to a profile by CNN Vatican analyst John Allen published by the National Catholic Reporter. The new pope brings together the first and the developing worlds, Allen writes. Besides his Italian roots, Francis studied theology in Germany. His career coincided with the so-called Dirty War in Argentina, which lasted from 1976 until 1983. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 people were killed or disappeared during the country's military dictatorship. The church was seen by some as having not have done enough that period. In particular, Francis was accused in a complaint filed three days before the 2005 conclave of complicity in the 1976 kidnapping of two liberal Jesuit priests, Allen writes. Francis reportedly denied the charge. He is known for his simplicity and has a reputation of being a voice for the poor. ""We live in the most unequal part of the world, which has grown the most yet reduced misery the least,"" Allen quoted Francis as saying during a gathering of Latin American bishops in 2007. ""The unjust distribution of goods persists, creating a situation of social sin that cries out to heaven and limits the possibilities of a fuller life for so many of our brothers."" First Latin American pope 'very exciting' 'The butt kicker that's needed' Francis is fan of the San Lorenzo soccer club in Argentina, and a lover of tango, according to Telam, Argentina's state news agency. Telam says the new pope has just one lung, but a Vatican spokesman said he was unable to confirm whether that report was true. As a Jesuit, Francis is a member of the Society of Jesus, one of the biggest and most important orders in the church. Jesuits are recognized for their exceptional educational institutions and focus on social justice. ""The new Pope Francis is supposedly a reformer of sorts. He reformed the Jesuits, fighting against liberation theology when that was on the rise in Argentina,"" said Raymond Arroyo, a CNN contributor and Catholic television host. About 480 million of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics live in Latin America, but no one from the region had ever been chosen as pope. By electing who they did, the cardinals sent a strong message about where the future of the church may lie. Francis takes the helm of a Catholic Church that has been rocked in recent years by sex abuse by priests and claims of corruption and infighting among the church hierarchy. ""From the people I've spoken to here in the Vatican who know him well, they say he is, pardon the French here, the butt kicker that's needed,"" Arroyo said. Opinion: Pope Francis - humble, authentic and credible .","The new pope reportedly has just one lung; he is 76 .
He is the first Jesuit to become pope .
He will be called Pope Francis, in honor of St. Francis of Assisi .

"President Obama won the 2012 presidential election by accumulating some of the most one-sided electoral constituencies in modern political history. Looking at a breakdown of the 2012 election exit polling, Obama won the 18- to 29-year-old vote 60% to 37%, in spite of the fact that half of all recent college graduates are unemployed or underemployed. He won women by 11 points and unmarried women by an incredible 36 points. The marriage gap was far greater than the gender gap. Obama won African-Americans with 93% of the vote, virtually unchanged from the 95% he won in 2008. Latinos, one of the fastest growing demographics, went 71% to 27% in favor of Obama. And he won with Asians by a similarly enormous margin. Among those who make less than $50,000 a year, Obama won 60% to 38%. Jindal: 'Stop being the stupid party' Mitt Romney, on the other hand, won white voters 59% to 39% and those making over $50,000 a year by 53% to 45%. This was the drumbeat of the Obama campaign. To women they said: Republicans are waging a ""war on women,"" trying to outlaw abortion and contraception and would take them back to their rights in the 1950s. To minorities they said: Republicans are anti-government services, cold-blooded individualists, and cannot represent minority communities. To middle and low income Americans they said: Republicans are the party of the rich, who will slash taxes for only the richest Americans and cut social safety nets for the poor. Rather than offer a broad sweeping vision for the country, Democrats played identity politics. Republicans were the culprits, and women, young adults, black, Latinos, etc... were the victims. And voters believed it. Why? For the same reason this litany -- gender, race, ethnicity, class -- sound so familiar. Opinion: Democrats, don't get too cocky . Voters believed it, not because it was something new or groundbreaking, but because this has been the template of many of our character-building institutions -- our public schools, our colleges, and public universities -- for the past 50 years. Go to any major university in America and this is the mindset that is taught, preached, and ingested. It also gets an assist from television drama, from the movies, and from much of the mainstream media. For decades liberals have succeeded in defining the national discourse, the terms of discussion, and, therefore, the election, in these terms. They have successfully set the parameters and focus of the national and political dialogue as predominantly about gender, race, ethnicity, and class. This is the paradigm, the template through which many Americans, probably a majority, more or less view the world, our country, and the election. It is a divisive strategy and Democrats have targeted and exploited those divides. Poll: Fiscal cliff headache for middle class . How else can we explain that more young people now favor socialism to capitalism? According to a Pew Research poll taken last year, 49% of Americans age 18-29 have a positive view of socialism while just 46% have a positive view of capitalism. Such a view has roots. So while we Republicans opine about election strategies and changing demographics, and appropriately so as that is our immediate order of business, in the long run we must address the problem at its source: the culture. Politics are downstream from the culture. Plato summarized the two most important questions in a society: Who teaches the young and what do we teach them? For the past 50 years liberals have had majority control of the character-forming institutions. If the national dialogue stays on their terms -- gender, race, ethnicity, class -- Republicans will continue to lose. Opinion: Failure to attract millennials is sinking the GOP . We must counter the discourse and speak and educate in terms of family, faith, freedom, principle, values, work, country, community, improvement, growth, and equality of opportunity. No longer can the Republican Party be solely the party of business. Who controls the terms of discussion, dialogue, and education controls the country and, therefore, the election. It's time for Republicans to take it back. This will require much work and time, but there is no more important business.","William Bennett: Democrats played identity politics in the presidential race .
Bennett: Voters believed it because they have been preached at for the past 50 years .

"(CNN) -- Nine sites in the central Pacific will be set as sanctuaries for marine life and bases of research for scientists, President Bush said Tuesday. The new designated areas make up the largest area of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world. The sites, designated in three regions of the central Pacific, will make up the largest expanse of ocean set aside for marine conservation in the world: 195,280 square miles. ""For sea birds and marine life, they will be sanctuaries to grow and thrive. For scientists, they will be places to extend the frontiers of discovery,"" Bush said. ""And for the American people, they will be places that honor our duty to be good stewards of the Almighty's creation."" For the designation, Bush used the 1906 Antiquities Act, which President Theodore Roosevelt first used to set aside public lands such as the Grand Canyon as national monuments. Many areas created under the act later became national parks. Watch Bush dedicate the central Pacific sites » . The Marine Conservation Biology Institute and the Environmental Defense Fund partnered to identify eight of the nine sites the president set aside Tuesday. All but one of those eight remote areas have Fish and Wildlife Service refuge areas at their cores. The eight sites are Rose Atoll, Wake Island, Johnston Island, Palmyra Island, Kingman Reef, Baker Island, Howland Island and Jarvis Island. Rose Atoll, part of American Samoa, is the smallest atoll in the world, but more than 500 fish species swim in the waters around it, and it supports 97 percent of America Samoa's seabird population. It is also the nesting ground for several threatened turtle species. The Pew Environmental Fund identified the ninth site: the waters around the northern Marianas and the deepest ocean canyon in the world, the Mariana Trench, 11,033 meters (36,201 feet) at its deepest. The new designations will expand protection to a 50 nautical mile area off the islands, where commercial fishing will be prohibited. Other uses of the area -- research or recreational fishing -- will be allowed but will require a permit. Bush also announced that the United States will submit a request to establish George Washington's Virginia home, Mount Vernon, and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument as UNESCO world heritage sites. UNESCO is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Bush designated 138,000 square miles in Hawaii two years ago, making Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument the ""largest fully protected marine area in the world,"" Bush said. CNN's KC Wildmoon contributed to this report.","Sites cover 195,280 square miles, world's largest expanse set aside for conservation .

"(CNN) -- When Ana María Tekina-eirú Maynard filled out her census form last year, she checked the box for Latino, and for the first time, she also checked the box for Native American. It had taken her more than 30 years -- plus research and genetic testing -- to discover her ties to the indigenous Taínos of Puerto Rico, to claim her identity and re-learn what she thought she knew of her history. She's not the only one. Since 2000, the number of Hispanics who identified themselves as Native American grew from 407,073 to 685,150, according to the 2010 census. Census: Hispanics drive growth of U.S. white population . Some attribute the increase to immigration from parts of North and South America where there are large indigenous populations. In some cases, it's because of recently discovered ties to native cultures. Growing up in the Bronx, New York, and spending summers in Puerto Rico, Maynard said she had no words to identify who she was. She just felt ""different."" How do you self-identify? Tell us in CNN iReport's Cultural Census . ""It is one thing to know that you have indigenous blood,"" Maynard said. ""And I have always known it. I look at the faces of my mother and grandmother, and that reality is undeniable."" But Maynard had long been taught that Taíno Indians, the indigenous people of Puerto Rico, were ""gone, dead and buried"" for centuries, decimated by Spaniards who arrived on the island in the 16th century. ""Why would you question what you have always been taught and what was considered as common knowledge?"" she asked. Still, 14 years ago, Maynard founded the Puerto Rican Folkloric Dance & Cultural Center in Austin, Texas, to preserve the culture of indiginous Puerto Ricans. Today, Maynard gives dance and singing classes as a volunteer at the center, in addition to her full-time job as an engineer with IBM. Four years ago, Maynard heard about the work of Dr. Juan Carlos Martinez Cruzado, a geneticist from the University of Puerto Rico. In an island-wide genetic study, he found that at least 61.1% of those surveyed had mitochondrial DNA of indigenous origin. Cruzado's findings eventually cast doubt upon the notion that the Taínos of Puerto Rico had been completely extinguished but suggested that they assimilated. ""When I learned about (Cruzado's) work, my life changed,"" Maynard said. ""It was an awakening that the Taíno heritage was not extinct."" Map how the United States has changed . For Maynard, this was a living heritage to reclaim. Months later, she took a DNA test that confirmed she was Taíno via her mother's ancestry. ""I walked through that door and for the first time had a deep understanding of who I was,"" she said. Despite diminished numbers -- the Taíno population decreased from 8 million in 1492 to 20,000 in 1520 to 200 in 1560 -- the Taíno culture has survived and is still present in the language today, said Jose Barreiro, assistant director for research at the National Museum of the American Indian. ""I am originally from Cuba, and I like to say to my fellow Cubans that Cuba is a Taíno word,"" Barreiro said. ""They have no idea that when they say the word Cuba, they are speaking Taíno. It means 'big land, well-planted.' "" Mario Garza created the Indigenous Cultures Institute in 2005, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the research and preservation of indigenous cultures. It tries to educate people with indigenous roots who label themselves ""Hispanic,"" Garza said. The increasing number of people who identified as Latino and Native American in 2010 give him hope. ""The Spaniards tried to destroy our civilization and history, outlawed our ceremonies, yet we are still here,"" Garza said. ""With a bigger group of Native Americans, we have a better chance of getting federal recognition and grants."" But for Maynard, it wasn't about gaining political power; it was a way to acknowledge her newly discovered Taíno heritage. Her Census form showed that the culture was still alive. In a sacred ceremony, Maynard's priest gave her a consecrated Taíno name: ""Tekina-eirú."" It means ""sweet teacher."" The name is apt, Maynard said, as she wants to teach the Taíno culture to those that come to her cultural center. Her two children will need to learn their own lessons about identity. She wants her children to know about what she yearned for: their roots.","Ana Maria Tekina-eirú Maynard discovered her Taíno heritage in her 30s .

"(CNN)It's enough to make Mulder and Scully seethe with envy. Nearly 130,000 pages of declassified Air Force files on UFO investigations and sightings are now available in one place online. Declassified government records about UFOs have long existed on microfilm in the National Archives in Washington, DC. Many of them also live on websites devoted to the topic, sometimes free, sometimes not. But UFO enthusiast John Greenewald says his database, Project Blue Book Collection, is the first to compile every single declassified document from the Blue Book project -- headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio from 1947 to 1969 -- in one place for anyone to search or download for free. The collection consists of files from Project Blue Book, Project Sign and Project Grudge, the names given to official investigations into unidentified flying objects by the United States military. Greenewald's efforts are not motivated by a close encounter or personal experience with unidentified flying objects. He says he's just driven by curiosity. ""I'm a history buff. I think this stuff should be accessible,"" he said. ""Secrets are not bad things; I think we should know about this and it should be in history books."" Greenewald started requesting information related to Project Blue Book through the Freedom of Information Act 15 years ago. His interest was piqued by the first case he received information on about a 1970 UFO incident in Iran, after Project Blue Book ended. ""It defied explanation,"" he said, ""and 5,000 FOIAs later my curiosity hasn't gone away."" The collection contains 10,000 PDFs, each representing a different case. The files include the details of some of the most famous UFO cases, including the Exeter incident, the Kenneth Arnold sighting and the Mantell crash. Still, Greenewald believes the contents are ""just the tip of the iceberg."" ""It's all a puzzle,"" he said. ""Just when you think you've got all the pieces to make a picture, you realize it's only a piece of a bigger puzzle."" The Blue Book project was discontinued after a joint review concluded that no significant information had come from it, according to declassified documents on the National Archives website. Specifically, the review said no UFO ""reported, investigated and evaluated"" ever gave ""any indication of threat to our national security."" Nor did the investigations suggest that the sightings ""represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present-day scientific knowledge,"" a 1985 Wright-Patterson fact sheet said. ""Since Project BLUE BOOK was closed, nothing has happened to indicate that the Air Force ought to resume investigating UFOs."" Greenewald is not so sure -- especially not after viewing all the documents, which are full of blacked-out material. If the U.S. military can't identify some unidentified flying objects, then who can, he wonders? And what are they? ""The biggest takeaway for me is don't believe the company line,"" he said. ""I think something big is going on. How big, I don't think anyone will know for quite some time because government continues to make the rules. ""It's a hard game to when they make the rules and they're the referee.""","Project Blue Book Collection contains nearly 130,000 pages of investigations into UFOs .

"(CNN) -- Filmmaker Roman Polanski has been arrested on an arrest warrant stemming from a decades-old sex charge, Swiss police said Sunday. Roman Polanski attends a film premiere in Paris, France, in June 2009. The Academy Award-winning director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, acknowledging he had sex with a 13-year-old girl, but fled the United States before he could be sentenced. U.S. authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in 1978. He was taken into custody trying to enter Switzerland on Saturday, Zurich police said. Polanski, 76, has lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the U.S. He declined to collect his Academy Award for Best Director in person when he won it for ""The Pianist"" in 2003. He was en route to the Zurich Film Festival, which is holding a tribute to him, when he was arrested by Swiss authorities, the festival said. Polanski was nominated for best director Oscars for ""Tess"" and ""Chinatown,"" and for best writing for ""Rosemary's Baby,"" which he also directed. ""Roman Polanski, who is one of the greatest film directors of all time, would have been honored for his life's work in Zurich today,"" the film festival said in a statement. ""However yesterday, on Saturday, he was taken into custody while attempting to enter Switzerland due to a request by U.S. authorities in connection with an arrest warrant from 1978."" The Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was put ""in provisional detention."" But whether he can be extradited to the United States ""can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalised,"" a ministry spokesman said in an e-mail. ""It is possible to appeal at the federal penal court of justice against an arrest warrant in view to extradition as well as against an extradition decision,"" the spokesman wrote. ""Their decisions can be taken further to the federal court of justice."" Polanski was accused of plying a 13-year-old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts, including intercourse, with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson's house. He was 43 at the time. Nicholson was not at home, but his girlfriend at the time, actress Anjelica Huston, was. According to a probation report contained in the filing, Huston described the victim as ""sullen."" ""She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25. She did not look like a 13-year-old scared little thing,"" Huston said. She added that Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl. ""I don't think he's a bad man,"" she said in the report. ""I think he's an unhappy man."" Polanski pleaded guilty to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years, but the sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to return to attend hearings. Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who ""drugged and raped a 13-year-old child."" Polanski's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out, but a Los Angeles judge rejected the request. In doing so, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court. Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way Polanski's case was handled years ago. According to court documents, Polanski, his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they'd worked out a deal that would spare Polanski from prison and let the young victim avoid a public trial. But the original judge in the case, who is now dead, first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing. Then, on the eve of his sentencing, the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days. Polanski fled the United States for France, where he was born. In the February hearing, Espinoza mentioned a documentary film that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media-obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he didn't send Polanski to prison. ""It's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct,"" said Espinoza. But he declined to dismiss the case entirely. Legal experts said such a ruling would have been extremely rare. Polanski's victim is among those calling for the case to be tossed out. Samantha Geimer filed court papers in January saying, ""I am no longer a 13-year-old child. I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim, have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception. ""Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court, great focus is made of me, my family, my mother and others. That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety, the continuation of the case."" Geimer, now 45, married and a mother of three, sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement. She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly, she said, because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled. Following Espinoza's ruling earlier this year, Geimer's lawyer, Larry Silver, said he was disappointed and that Espinoza ""did not get to the merits and consider the clear proof of both judicial and prosecutorial corruption."" He argued in court that had ""Mr. Polanski been treated fairly"" his client would not still be suffering because of publicity almost 32 years after the crime. Polanski was arrested two days after one of his wife's killers died. The director's pregnant wife, actress Sharon Tate, and four others were butchered by members of the Manson ""family"" in August 1969. Polanski was filming in Europe at the time. By her own admission, Susan Atkins held the eight-months-pregnant Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, stabbing the 26-year-old actress 16 times. Atkins, 61, died Thursday. She had been suffering from terminal brain cancer. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.","NEW: Extradition can be fought in court, Swiss Justice Ministry says .

"H.R. Giger, the Swiss surrealist artist whose works of sexual-industrial imagery and design of the eponymous creature in the ""Alien"" movies were known around the world, has died. He was 74. His death was confirmed by a statement from his longtime friend and manager, Leslie Barany. ""We are absolutely heartbroken over the loss of this loving husband, selfless friend and supremely talented artist,"" the statement read. ""He truly was one of a kind, committed to his craft, to his friends and to his family. His warm personality, incredible generosity and sharp sense of humor were in stark contrast with the universe he depicted in his art."" Giger's art -- often featuring skeletal, tentacled, protomechanical (Giger called them ""biomechanical"") figures rendered in shades of blue-gray and brown -- was a mainstay of dorm-room bookshelves and science-fiction hallucinations. Among his most widely known works was the cover for Emerson, Lake & Palmer's 1973 album ""Brain Salad Surgery."" But he's probably best known for his design of the Alien, the extraterrestrial species in Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi/horror film ""Alien"" and its sequels. With its oblong, skull-like head, dozens of teeth, narrow torso and spiny, whip-quick tail, it was a fearsome creature that salivated acid and appeared to come and go at will. Indeed, the being that terrorizes the spaceship in the first film literally explodes out of actor John Hurt's chest before skittering away. Encouraged by ""Alien"" screenwriter Dan O'Bannon, Scott turned to Giger after seeing similar creatures in the artist's 1977 book, ""Necronomicon."" Giger and the special effects team won an Oscar for their work. The Alien, also known as the Xenomorph, later appeared in ""Aliens"" (1986), ""Alien 3"" (1992), ""Alien: Resurrection"" (1997), ""Alien vs. Predator"" (2004) and its 2007 sequel, and -- in somewhat different form -- ""Prometheus"" (2012). Giger, who called the creatures ""my monsters,"" told CNN in 2011 that his work was, indeed, shaped by nightmares. ""I feel very, very safe and happy and I have no more nightmares, but at the time, in earlier days, I could heal myself through doing my work,"" he said. Barany's statement addressed Giger's fondness for the Xenomorph. ""It was certainly a design which Giger prized, much as he took great pride in his collaboration with myriads of music industry and film artists, since he began his glorious journey as a world-class painter, sculptor and designer,"" read the statement. Hans Rudolf Giger was born on February 5, 1940, in Chur, Switzerland. The son of a pharmacist, he showed a talent for drawing at an early age and originally trained to be an architect. But he maintained a separate life as an artist, turning to the field fulltime in the 1960s. He had a longterm relationship with actress Li Tobler, who served as the model for several of his works. Tobler committed suicide in 1975. Giger was married twice; he is survived by his wife, Carmen Maria Scheifele Giger. In the late '60s, a friend published a number of Giger's works as posters. Within a couple years, he was in demand by galleries and curators. In 1974, Giger was asked to do the design for Alejandro Jodorowsky's doomed version of ""Dune,"" now the subject of a documentary, ""Jodorowsky's Dune."" Among the other participants in ""Dune"" was one of Giger's heroes, the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dali. Giger also created the cover for Debbie Harry's 1981 album ""Koo Koo,"" which featured the Blondie singer with long needles impaling her face, and was a designer on the 1996 film ""Species."" His work was much praised. ""I think his ideas are very existential,"" Norwegian curator Stina Hogkvist told CNN in 2011. ""What makes up a human being; when does a life start, when does it end; what is natural and what is unnatural. It's always interesting and always relevant."" In later years, Giger had his own museum in Gruyeres, Switzerland. It included his own work, as well as pieces by Dali and Ernst Fuchs. His life, Giger said in 2011, had grown much calmer. ""I have not to work absolutely now. I like to be free to dream,"" he said. People we've lost in 2014 .","H.R. Giger created ""Alien's"" Xenomorph along with album covers .

"An employee of the Florida State Attorney's Office who testified that prosecutors withheld evidence from George Zimmerman's defense team has been fired. Ben Kruidbos had been on paid administrative leave since May 28 from his job as director of information technology for the State Attorney's Office. A spokeswoman for Fourth Judicial Circuit State Attorney Angela Corey said Kruidbos was no longer an employee of the office. Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, is on trial in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin last year. Kruidbos testified before Zimmerman's trial began that Martin's cell phone contained images of Martin blowing smoke, images of marijuana and deleted text messages regarding a transaction for a firearm and that those images had not been given to Zimmerman's defense team. He received the termination letter, dated July 11, on Friday, the same day jurors began deliberating Zimmerman's case. The letter states: ""It has come to our attention that you violated numerous State Attorney's Office (SAO) policies and procedures and have engaged in deliberate misconduct that is especially egregious in light of your position."" Read the termination letter . Kruidbos said that, when he printed a 900-page Florida Department of Law Enforcement report from Martin's cell phone in late 2012 or early 2013, he noticed information was missing. Concerned that attorneys did not have all the information they needed to prepare the case, he said, he reported his concerns to a State Attorney's Office investigator and later to prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda. Kruidbos said he generated a report that was more than three times the size of the one that had been handed over. For example, Kruidbos said that 2,958 photos were in the report given to the defense but that his report contained 4,275 photos. Kruidbos also said that he has been told to not put specific case-identifying information into internal e-mails. Through his attorney, Wesley White, Kruidbos informed Zimmerman's defense team that the information existed. Did investigators blow the Zimmerman case? In court, Kruidbos testified that he was concerned that he could be held liable if all information wasn't shared. ""All the information is important in the process to ensure it's a fair trial,"" he said. In a six-page dismissal letter, the State Attorney's Office, Fourth Judicial Circuit, blasted Kruidbos' assertions and motivations. Managing Director Cheryl R. Peek accused Kruidbos of having erased data from a laptop in violation of the Public Records Law and derided his concern about being held liable as ""feigned and spurious"" and ""nothing more than shameful manipulation in a shallow, but obvious, attempt to cloak yourself in the protection of the whistleblower law."" She concluded, ""Because of your deliberate, willful and unscrupulous actions, you can never again be trusted to step foot in this office. Your have left us with no choice but to terminate your employment."" But the defense said Kruidbos' testimony supports its claim that the state violated the rules of discovery. Ex-Sanford police chief: Zimmerman probe 'taken away from us' ""When it takes me six months to get a color picture of my client, when the first one I get is a black and white, when I look at it and go, 'This is off a cell phone; cell phones don't take black-and-white pictures,' and I ask for a color copy, that takes two months,"" defense lawyer Mark O'Mara said Wednesday in an interview with CNN's Martin Savidge. ""And then I get a pastel-colored color copy of it, and it takes me to file a motion and have a hearing set before I get the actual .jpeg, no, that's frustrating. That should not happen. I've done this too long to make believe in my own mind that that's happenstance."" O'Mara said he learned about the missing information months after he was to have received it. ""The only way that we really found out about it ... and the only way that we really found out about the intensity of the failure to give us information was when a person from their own office, a whistle-blower, came forward and said, 'I gave them that information in the middle to end of January' and we didn't get it until June 4th."" He said he was ""beyond"" shocked. ""It could have derailed the trial,"" he said. The defense said it did not get the complete report until a few days before the trial. O'Mara and co-counsel Don West argued that they needed more time to go through the information found on Martin's phone and asked for a delay, which was denied. Judge Debra Nelson said before the trial that the possibility of sanctions -- requested by the defense -- would be addressed after the verdict. The defense team declined to comment Saturday.","State worker Ben Kruidbos had been on paid leave since May 28 .

"President Barack Obama apologized Thursday to those Americans whose insurance plans are being canceled due to the federal health law he championed even though he said repeatedly they could keep their coverage if they liked. ""I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,"" he told NBC News in an exclusive interview. ""We've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this,"" he added. Obama's comments come days after he attempted to clarify what he meant when he assured Americans in previous years that they would be able to keep their plans under the Affordable Care Act, a controversy that is prompting legislation in Congress to address it. Obama further alters 'you can keep your plan' pledge . Republicans have hammered Obama over the promise since insurers began discontinuing coverage for some of the 12 million Americans who buy individual policies on the private market that don't meet Obamacare requirements for more comprehensive care. GOP moves past troubled Obamacare website . Insurance companies appear to be doing this for a variety of reasons; some are pulling all their plans from certain states where they have fewer subscribers in order to save money. In many cases, affected policyholders are being squeezed. They either don't qualify for subsidies to lower the cost of new premiums or they may have to pay more in the health care exchange marketplace. When Obama says he's looking to fix it, he primarily means steps that can be taken administratively, senior administration officials said. Some experts suggest one possible approach would be to ask insurers to delay the cancellation of plans and extend them into the New Year so that people are not left without insurance. That has been done, for example, in the state of California. But House Speaker John Boehner said an Obama apology was in order and said the Republican-led House had its own plan in mind. ""What Americans want to hear is that the President is going to keep his promise. That's why the House will vote next week to allow anyone with a health care plan they like to keep it,"" Boehner said. ""If the President is sincerely sorry that he misled the American people, the very least he can do is support this bipartisan effort. Otherwise, this apology doesn't amount to anything."" The administration eventually knew that many policies would be changed by the insurance carriers after Obamacare was introduced, and the associated political uproar since its October 1 online rollout has also angered Democrats and fueled Republican efforts to extend related controversies onto the campaign trail. Vulnerable Senate Democrats voice concerns . In 2010, the Health and Human Services Department estimated that 40% to 67% of individual plans would eventually lose their ""grandfathered"" status, which only was conferred if a plan was purchased before the health care law was approved in 2010. Although Obama said the ""buck stops"" with him on Obamacare problems to date -- including the rocky rollout of the website -- he still was resolute that his initiative to provide coverage for the uninsured and better coverage for many others would be better for the country. ""Most of the folks who ... got these cancellation letters, they'll be able to get better care at the same cost or cheaper in these new marketplaces,"" Obama said, also noting that ""we have to make sure"" people do not feel as if they've been betrayed by an effort carried out with their best interests in mind. ""They'll have more choice, they'll have more competition. They're part of a bigger pool. The insurance companies are going to be hungry for their business. So the majority of folks will end up being better off,"" he said. Key elements of the health law prohibit discrimination for pre-existing conditions and require new plans cover maternity care, mental health and other areas. The program was developed to put comprehensive care within reach of millions of uninsured Americans. About 95% of legal U.S. residents receive health insurance through private employers or the federal government, the Obama administration says. But more than 48 million Americans don't have any coverage. Debunking 4 Obamacare myths: Both sides get it wrong . Obama's apology comes a week after similar refrains were made by Vice President Joe Biden and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius regarding the botched Obamacare online rollout. Five things we learned from Obamacare records . WH: Chief tech officer too busy for congressional testimony . Asked if he thinks Americans will be able to trust what he says in the future, Obama said he thinks he'll ultimately be ""judged on whether"" Obamacare is better for Americans overall. ""When you try to do something big like make our health care system better ... there are going to be problems along the way, even if ultimately what you're doing is going to make a whole lot of people better off, and I hope that people will look at the end product and they're going to be able to look back and say, you know what, we now have protections we didn't have before,"" he said. In the NBC interview, Obama reiterated the administration's line that he's ""confident"" a ""majority of people"" will be able to use the website and apply for insurance by November 30. But he did not say whether he would push back the March 31 deadline to enroll or the penalty for those who do not purchase insurance. Obamacare depends on younger, healthier Americans to buy into the program and pay premiums to offset costs for covering older people who need more health care. Those without insurance who do not sign up for a plan face a fine. What else could go wrong with Obamacare? A Gallup poll conducted just over a week ago showed 36% of Americans said they didn't think that in the long run the Affordable Care Act would make much of a difference to their family's health care situation. Just over a third said the health care law would make matters worse, and one in four said that Obamacare would make things better. Opinion: Here's the truth about Obamacare .","Obama says in interview with NBC he's sorry .

"European officials reacted with fury Sunday to a report that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on EU offices. The European Union warned that if the report is accurate, it will have tremendous repercussions. ""I am deeply worried and shocked about the allegations,"" European Parliament President Martin Schulz said in a statement. ""If the allegations prove to be true, it would be an extremely serious matter which will have a severe impact on EU-US relations. On behalf of the European Parliament, I demand full clarification and require further information speedily from the U.S. authorities with regard to these allegations."" German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger ""said if the accusations were true, it was reminiscent of the Cold War,"" ministry spokesman Anders Mertzlufft said, adding that the minister ""has asked for an immediate explanation from the United States."" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius called for a swift explanation from American authorities. ""These acts, if they are confirmed, would be absolutely unacceptable,"" he said in a statement. The outrage from European officials over the weekend was the latest fallout since Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency computer contractor, started spilling details of U.S. surveillance programs to reporters earlier this month. Citing information from secret documents obtained by Snowden, the German news magazine Der Spiegel reported Sunday that several U.S. spying operations targeted European Union leaders. Der Spiegel said it had ""in part seen"" documents from Snowden that describe how the National Security Agency bugged EU officials' Washington and New York offices and conducted an ""electronic eavesdropping operation"" that tapped into a EU building in Brussels, Belgium. The magazine's report also says that NSA spying has targeted telephone and Internet connection data in Germany more than any other European nation. An average of up to 20 million phone connections and 10 million Internet data connections are surveyed daily, Der Spiegel said, noting that the intensity of surveillance puts the U.S. ally on par with China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Another report Sunday claimed that surveillance extended beyond European offices. The Guardian newspaper reported that one NSA document leaked by Snowden describes 38 embassies and missions as ""targets"" and details surveillance methods that include planting bugs in communications equipment and collecting transmissions with specialized antennae. Targets included France, Italy, Greece, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, India and Turkey, according to The Guardian. CNN has not independently confirmed the allegations in the reports from Der Spiegel and the Guardian. U.S. officials did not immediately respond to the Guardian's report. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment Sunday on specific allegations published in Der Spiegel. ""The United States government will respond appropriately to the European Union through our diplomatic channels, and through the EU/U.S. experts' dialogue on intelligence that the U.S. proposed several weeks ago,"" the office said in a statement. ""We will also discuss these issues bilaterally with EU member states. While we are not going to comment publicly on specific alleged intelligence activities, as a matter of policy, we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations."" Ben Rhodes, White House deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, said he had not seen the report and ""would not comment on unauthorized disclosures of intelligence programs. The intelligence community would be the most appropriate to do that."" Rhodes added that ""those are some of our closest intelligence partners, so it's worth noting that the Europeans work very closely with us.  We have very close intelligence relationships with them."" Father proposes deal for Snowden's voluntary return . U.S. asks Ecuador to reject any asylum request from Snowden . Michael Hayden, a former director of the NSA and CIA, told ""Face the Nation"" on CBS on Sunday morning that he didn't know whether the report was true. ""I've been out of government for about five years, so I really don't know, and even if I did, I wouldn't confirm or deny it,"" he said. ""But I think I can confirm a few things for you here this morning. Number one, the United States does conduct espionage. Number two, our Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans' privacy, is not an international treaty. And number three, any European who wants to go out and rend their garments with regard to international espionage should look first and find out what their governments are doing."" European Union spokeswoman Marlene Holzner, in a e-mail to CNN, said, ""We have immediately been in contact with the U.S. authorities in Washington D.C. and in Brussels and have confronted them with the press reports. They have told us they are checking on the accuracy of the information released yesterday and will come back to us."" In Brussels, Der Spiegel says, the agency targeted the Justus Lipsius Building, which houses the European Council and the EU Council of Ministers, the union's main decision-making and legislative body. And in Washington, the magazine report claims, the NSA installed bugs in the European Union's building and infiltrated its computer network. Der Spiegel's report comes as negotiations for a trans-Atlantic trade agreement between the United States and the European Union are set to start next month in Washington. Obama: Pay no attention to that man we can't capture . Snowden has revealed himself as the source of documents outlining a massive effort by the NSA to track cell phone calls and monitor the e-mail and Internet traffic of virtually all Americans. Critics slam him as a traitor. Supporters hail him as a hero. Now Snowden, who faces espionage charges in the United States, is in Russia and seeking asylum from Ecuador. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden asked Ecuador ""to please reject"" the request for asylum, according to Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa. ""That's not acceptable,"" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday. Assange, whose organization facilitates the release of classified documents and is assisting Snowden's asylum bid, said he couldn't reveal details about the former NSA contractor's specific location or the status of his case. He criticized U.S. officials for pressuring Ecuador on the matter. ""Asylum is a right that we all have. It's an international right. The United States has been founded largely on accepting political refugees from other countries and has prospered by it. Mr. Snowden has that right,"" said Assange. ""Ideally, he should be able to return to the United States. Unfortunately, that's not the world that we live in and hopefully another country will give him the justice that he deserves."" Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro weighed in on Sunday. In a letter to Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega published in Cuban state media, Castro praised Ecuador's president for standing up to U.S. threats over Snowden. On Saturday night, Correa said the ball was in Russia's court. ""We didn't ask to be in this situation. Mr. Snowden has been in touch with Mr. Assange, who recommended he ask for asylum in Ecuador. In order to process this request, he needs to be in Ecuadorian territory,"" Correa said in an interview with Ecuador's Oromar TV on Saturday night. ""At this point, the solution for Snowden's final destination is in the hands of the Russian authorities."" Russian President Vladimir Putin has said it's up to Snowden to figure out his next step. ""The sooner he selects his final destination point, the better both for us and for himself,"" Putin said. A top Russian lawmaker said Sunday that Russia must not hand Snowden over to the United States. ""It's not a matter of Snowden's usefulness to Russia, it's a matter of principle,"" Alexei Pushkov -- who heads the international affairs committee at the Duma, the lower house of parliament -- said on Twitter.

"(CNN)Azerbaijan is an oil and gas rich nation that hugs the western shore of the Caspian Sea. Bordering Iran, Georgia, Russia and Armenia, it has a population of 9.6 million people, according to the CIA World Factbook. Roughly a quarter of the country's residents live in the capital, Baku, a cosmopolitan urban center that combines ultra-modern skyscrapers with a historic Walled City that is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Islam is the most prominent religion in Azerbaijan although, according to the country's government, there are also minority Jewish and Orthodox Christian communities. Azerbaijan gained formal independence from the former USSR in 1991 after initially declaring its national sovereignty in 1988. Since then, it has been locked in an ongoing territorial dispute with ethnic Armenian separatists. A six-year conflict between 1988 and 1994 saw separatists, backed by troops from Armenia, and Azerbaijani forces fight over the Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakichevan regions in the southwest of the country. A ceasefire was agreed in 1994, but by then the separatists, who are seeking full independence from Azerbaijan, had taken control of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding provinces. Azerbaijan still claims sovereignty over these areas but has tried to resolve the issue by diplomatic means in the period since, according to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. But violence continues, and at least three Armenian soldiers were killed in clashes with Azerbaijani troops near Nagorno-Karabakh in March. Much of Azerbaijan's history has revolved around its vast oil and gas reserves. Ancient fire-worshipping civilization the Zoroastrians erected temples in the vicinity of burning gas vents at various sites across the country as far back as the third century, according to the Azerbaijan tourist board. These temples are now popular tourist attractions, with one of the most well preserved situated in Surakhani on the outskirts of Baku. At the beginning of the 20th century, however, Azerbaijanis hit on a new use for their bountiful natural resources -- industrial fuel. Vast sums of money poured into the country to fund oil exploration, and at one stage it was one of the world's major oil centers. Nowadays, Azerbaijan has a major role in oil exporting and is a major shareholder in an oil pipeline that runs from the Caspian Sea to Ceyhan in Turkey. In recent years, Azerbaijan has attempted to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on its natural resources. The country has developed successful construction, banking, retail and real estate sectors, although these were hit by the global financial downturn. Economic growth reached double digit figures between 2006 and 2008 before sliding back to 4.5% in 2014, according to the CIA World Factbook. Like many emerging market economies experiencing rapid growth and with access to vast natural resources, Azerbaijan has been impacted by corruption. Transparency International ranked the country 126th out of 178 countries in its Corruption Perceptions Index 2014, although the Azerbaijani government maintains it is attempting to eradicate graft. Azerbaijan has built closer ties with regional and international partners in recent years. The country joined the Council of Europe -- which aims to develop a common legal and democratic area across the continent -- in 2001, and works in conjunction with a consortium of western oil companies to extract its abundant natural resources. It is also working towards the legal and regulatory reforms that would enable accession to the World Trade Organization, according to the U.S Department of State. In October 2011,  Azerbaijan was awarded one of the six non-permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council. From January 2012, the country sat alongside permanent members of the Security Council -- France, China, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. -- for two years. Culturally, Azerbaijan has also been looking to raise its profile internationally. In 2011, the country won the Eurovision Song Contest, a continent-wide musical competition. As a result of this success, it hosted the Eurovision in Baku in May, 2012, which the country's state broadcaster said gave it the opportunity to further display its culture and traditions to the whole of Europe. On June 12th, Azerbaijan brings up the curtain on the first-ever European Games when its capital, Baku, welcomes some 6,000 athletes to this inaugural sporting festival. The Games, which will take place every four years, were brought into being at a vote by members of the European Olympic Committee (EOC) in 2012 and announced at a meeting of the body's General Assembly in Rome that December. Thirty-eight of the 49 EOC members backed the Games, which provide a European equivalent of the multi-sport Asian Games and the Pan-American Games, both of which have been part of the calendar since 1951. Azerbaijan wants to put itself and its capital at centre stage, with sports minister Azad Rahimov saying in an interview with the Guardian newspaper: ""The main important thing is to position our country on the map of the world and our country on the map of Europe. ""The best instrument to do that is sport and culture. Sport has a bigger potential for reaching the most people.""","Azerbaijan is a small nation that achieved independence from the USSR in 1991 .

"As you and your family look forward to countless holiday meals yet to come, the recently celebrated Antibiotic Awareness Week might have passed by unnoticed. Perhaps you've never heard of this global effort to bring attention to the increasing problem of antibiotic-resistant infections. But if you found yourself pausing in front of the ""antibiotic-free"" turkey on sale in many stores at Thanksgiving, wondering what those words meant -- and why these birds are more expensive than ones without that label -- you've already joined the debate about antibiotic use and misuse. The discovery of antibiotics revolutionized medicine some 75 years ago. It meant that bacterial infections that would otherwise result in death could be cured with miracle drugs like penicillin, sulfa and tetracycline. Infections following battlefield injuries or surgical procedures could finally be treated. Antibiotics could even be used to protect patients undergoing chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant from the potentially lethal consequences of a weakened immune system, allowing doctors to be more aggressive in the treatment of cancers. Some infections didn't respond to antibiotics, because the bacteria that caused them were ""resistant"" -- that is, they could disable an antibiotic, or pump it out as fast as it got into a bacterial cell. Some bacteria simply made alternate versions of the enzymes normally targeted by antibiotics, versions that were no longer blocked or inhibited by an antibiotic. Usually, there was another antibiotic on the shelf that could still be counted on to work. But that is no longer the case for many of the multi-drug-resistant bacteria causing infections around the world. How did we get to this point? The answer is complicated, but we can start with the turkey. For over 60 years, poultry and livestock have been fed antibiotics for their ""growth-promoting"" and ""disease-preventing"" effects. The Pew Charitable Trusts estimated that almost four-fifths of the 37 million pounds of antibiotics sold in the United States in 2011 were for meat and poultry production. Worldwide, more antibiotics are used for agriculture, aquaculture and horticulture than for treating humans.  These antibiotics act on the bacteria that live on and in all animals, suppressing the growth of bacteria that are sensitive to the antibiotic and favoring the growth of bacteria that are resistant. A nightmare health scenario we can stop . This selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animals has consequences for humans. Food-borne infections are increasingly caused by antibiotic-resistant Salmonella or campylobacter, with outbreaks causing recalls and warnings. But the less headline-grabbing effects might be worse.  Antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the feces of livestock and poultry make their way to environmental water sources, contaminate commercially sold meat, and are transferred directly to humans with animal contact. These antibiotic-resistant organisms can transfer the genetic know-how for antibiotic resistance to other bacteria within us. Because of this, the European Union banned the use of antibiotics in animals as growth promoters in 2006. Why hasn't the U.S. Food and Drug Administration done the same? The agency on Wednesday issued a proposal to phase out the use of certain antibiotics in food-producing animals. As early as 1973, the FDA published a rule in the Code of Federal Regulations directing drug companies to provide evidence that ""subtherapeutic"" antibiotic use in food animals to promote growth and prevent infection was safe -- or face withdrawal of approvals for such use. In 1977, the FDA made an announcement, proposing to withdraw approval of penicillin and tetracycline for use in food animals for any purpose other than treating active infection. Public hearings on the proposed withdrawals were to be held -- and that was the last action by the FDA until it withdrew the hearing notice in 2011 in response to suits by the Natural Resources Defense Council and others demanding that the FDA finally follow through on its plan from 1977. A ruling by U.S. magistrate judge Theodore Katz in March 2012 ordered the FDA to reissue its findings and initiate withdrawal proceedings, a decision the FDA has since appealed. In the intervening 40 years, the evidence linking antibiotic use in food animals and antibiotic-resistant infections in humans has continued to grow. The 2008 report of the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production documented this evidence, and made a priority recommendation to ""phase out and then ban the nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials"" in food animals. CDC sets threat levels for drug-resistant 'superbugs' Legislative efforts at the federal and state levels to implement this recommendation have met with no success, however, as detailed in the October 2013 follow-up by the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. The FDA has done little more than to urge drug companies to ""voluntarily"" stop marketing antibiotics for growth promotion -- but antibiotic use for disease ""prevention"" is not discouraged, and proposed rules even weaken veterinary oversight of this practice. Some opponents warn that modern agriculture will collapse if growth-promoting antibiotics are banned in food animals, but the evidence suggests the opposite. Countries such as Denmark, which reduced antibiotic use in animals by 60% since 1994 through bans, government monitoring and voluntary cutbacks, saw no declines in total production of poultry or pigs as a result -- and no increase in the amount of feed needed to produce a pound of meat. In fact, pork production has increased by 50% since 1994, and Denmark now exports 90% of all it produces. Lisa Heinzerling, a professor of law at Georgetown University, argued this year in the Vermont Law Review that the FDA is facing a ""moment of truth,"" a moment when ""an administrative agency must confront evidence concerning a social problem it is charged with addressing, and speak the truth, as best it can, about it."" Clearly, however, many entities involved in the sale and use of growth-promoting and preventive antibiotics in food animals profit from this practice and have effectively fought to delay its regulation and restriction. What can we do? To start, vote with our wallets and buy turkey or chicken or ham that's ""raised without antibiotics."" It sends a small but important message that encourages farmers who voluntarily avoid the use of antibiotics for growth promotion or disease prevention. But it's clear that the solution requires action on a bigger scale if the United States is to implement recommendations made repeatedly for more than 40 years to limit antibiotic use in animals to the treatment of infections. Hopefully, most of us have taken our doctors' advice to heart and no longer demand antibiotics for ourselves or our children at the first sign of a cold, sore throat, or cough -- all common symptoms of viral infections, on which antibiotics have no effect. What government tests found in your meat . Encouragingly, the resulting decreases in antibiotic use in the community can be linked to decreases in antibiotic-resistant infections. Campaigns to promote judicious use of antibiotics in hospitals are likewise followed by decreases in the number of infections caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Perhaps, in spite of the pressures to economize during this season, we can also examine the reasons used to justify antibiotic use in agriculture -- a bigger turkey or pig, sent to your table for a lower price -- and ask, are we really getting a bargain?","The EU in 2006 banned antibiotics in animals as growth promoters .

"Nineteen years ago, Ron Davis and Lucia McBath celebrated the birth of a son. Sunday, they should have celebrated Jordan Davis' birthday with him. Instead, they faced the prospect of a new trial for the man accused of killing him. A jury in Jacksonville on Saturday found Michael Dunn guilty of attempted second-degree murder for opening fire on three other teens in the same SUV as Jordan Davis -- but deadlocked on the murder charge against him in Davis' death. Prosecutors had argued that Dunn recklessly shot at the teens after complaining about the volume of their music in a convenience store parking lot. Three of his 10 shots struck Davis, one of them cutting through his liver, a lung and his aorta. Dunn testified that Davis threatened him and that he thought he saw a gun sticking out of the Dodge Durango. But Ron Davis said his son was a good kid and didn't deserve to be collateral damage in an argument over loud music. McBath said she was happy for a little bit of closure. ""It's sad for Mr. Dunn that he will live the rest of his life in that sense of torment, and I will pray for him,"" McBath said. ""And I have asked my family to pray for him, but we are so grateful for the charges that have been brought against him. We are so grateful for the truth."" And moments before prosecutor Angela Corey said she would seek a new trial on the murder charge, McBath said she and her ex-husband will continue to stand up for their son, who was 17 when he was killed. ""We will continue to wait for justice for Jordan,"" she said. Verdict evokes mixed reactions . Shooter faces decades in prison . A jury on Saturday night convicted Dunn of three charges of attempted murder for shooting at the other three teenagers in the SUV and one count of shooting into the vehicle on November 23, 2012. As the jury's decisions became clear about 7 p.m. Saturday, Dunn looked ahead solemnly with a frown but no tears. His lawyer, Cory Strolla, told reporters later that his client was ""in disbelief."" ""Even as he sat next to me, he asked, how is this happening,"" Strolla said. ""... It has not set in. I don't think it will set in anytime soon."" Ron Davis was pleased that Dunn face 60 years or more in prison for the attempted murder charges. ""He is going to learn that he must be remorseful for the killing of my son, that it was not just another day at the office. My son will never be just another day at the office where (Dunn) can leave the scene and be stoic,"" he told reporters. He wanted it known that Jordan was not a troublemaker. ""It wasn't allowed to be said in the courtroom, but he was a good kid. We will say it. He was a good kid,"" he said. ""There are a lot of good kids out there ... and they should have a voice. They shouldn't live in fear and walk around the streets worrying about if someone has a problem with somebody else that if they are shot, it is just collateral damage."" The incomplete finale to this hot-button trial -- emotionally charged partly because Dunn is white and the teenagers he shot at are black -- echoed George Zimmerman's trial for the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin about 120 miles down the road in Sanford, Florida. While the state's ""stand your ground"" law wasn't used by Dunn, his lawyers did argue that he fired in self-defense. Opinion: Florida shooter saw black, thought 'threat' Another murder trial? Given the partially hung jury, Corey, Florida's state attorney, said prosecutors would press for a new trial in Duval County on the murder charge. ""Justice for Jordan Davis is as important as it is for any victim,"" said Corey, whose office also handled the Zimmerman case. Even without a final decision on the murder count -- and pending defense appeals -- the 47-year-old Dunn is looking at a lengthy prison term. Prosecutor Erin Wolfson explained Saturday night that each attempted second-degree murder conviction carries a minimum sentence of at least 20 years. There's also a 15-year sentence possible on the conviction for shooting into the teenagers' vehicle. ""You are looking basically at life in prison,"" Strolla said, even as he vowed to challenge the convictions. ""At 47 years old, that's a life sentence regardless of count one."" CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said in most cases prosecutors will take some time after a mistrial to reflect on the case before planning the next steps. ""If he winds up with 60 or 75 years in jail, from a pragmatic standpoint it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to retry the case,"" he said Sunday. ""On the other hand if you're the parents of Jordan Davis and you believe, as well  you should, that your son's reputation has been besmirched by this self-defense claim, the family (might) want a retrial, and that's something that a prosecutor has to consider carefully. ""Hopefully (Corey will) look carefully  at the pluses and minuses of  doing a retrial."" The decision to convict on these counts, and not on murder, didn't come easily for a jury that had deliberated for about 30 hours since getting the case late Wednesday. Judge Russell Healey acknowledged earlier Saturday that the jury of four white women, two black women, four white men, an Asian woman and a Hispanic man was ""struggling, obviously."" ""But it's not for want of trying to reconcile all of this,"" he said then. ""I think we've got some analytical people in there who are trying to do just that -- trying to analyze this from every possible angle."" The lack of a murder conviction upset some, including protesters who marched outside the Jacksonville courthouse calling for Corey to lose her job. ""The people united will never be defeated,"" they chanted. Confrontation at a gas station . It was November 23, 2012, when Michael Dunn pulled into a gas station in Jacksonville, parking next to a red Dodge Durango with four teenagers inside. The teens had come in for gum and cigarettes; Dunn, meanwhile, had just left his son's wedding with his fiancee, who'd gone inside the convenience store for wine and chips. Dunn didn't like the loud music -- ""rap crap,"" as he called it -- coming from the teens' SUV. So he asked them to turn it down. What followed next depends on whom you believe. Dunn says Davis threatened him, and he decided to take matters into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the Durango. But prosecutors say it was Dunn who lost control, firing three volleys of shots -- 10 bullets total -- at the SUV over music he didn't like. Prosecutors challenged what he did next: He left the gas station and drove to his hotel, about three miles away. There, Dunn walked his dog, ordered a pizza, then drank rum and cola -- ""stunned and horrified, (shocked how) things escalated the way they did over a common courtesy."" After learning almost six hours later that he had killed Davis, Dunn testified that he became ""crazy with grief,"" experiencing stomach problems for about four hours before taking a nap. ""My intent was to stop the attack, not necessarily end a life,"" he testified. ""It just worked out that way."" Yet his fiancee, Rhonda Rouer, testified that Dunn had never mentioned any weapon to her -- be it a shotgun, a stick, a barrel or a lead pipe. In fact, police found a basketball, basketball shoes, clothing, a camera tripod and cups inside the teenagers' Durango. There was no gun. Dunn himself never called police. The first contact he had with them was at his home in Satellite Beach as he was being apprehended. Arguing that he wasn't in a rational state of mind, Dunn admitted, ""It makes sense that I should have (contacted authorities). We didn't. I can't tell you why."" Echoes of Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman . Some people were quick to compare Dunn to Zimmerman, who ultimately was acquitted of murder for the shooting of Martin. Martin's own parents were among them, claiming Davis' killing is another reminder that, in Florida, ""racial profiling and stereotypes"" may serve as the basis for illegitimate fear ""and the shooting and killing of young teenagers."" But Dunn's defense attorney, Strolla, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Friday that the Zimmerman and Dunn cases aren't so similar. There was a physical confrontation between Zimmerman and Martin, and police gave Zimmerman the benefit of the doubt about defending himself, Strolla said. ""My client did not wait to become that victim,"" he said. ""My client did not wait to either get assaulted by a weapon or have someone potentially pull a trigger,"" he said. Though a weapon was never found, Strolla maintains the youths could have had one and somehow ditched it. He said the key point was that Dunn believed they were armed and that his life was in danger. ""Now, does it sound irrational? Of course it sounds irrational. But have you ever been in that situation?"" the lawyer asked. Strolla said Saturday the four convictions leave him with regret, even as he said he couldn't immediately think of anything he'd do differently in the case. At the same time, the prosecution didn't manage a conviction on what was by far the biggest charge: first-degree murder. This mixed bag means that no one can fully celebrate the jury's decision. ""Everybody lost something in this,"" the lawyer said. His client ""will live to fight another day"" in court, but he and his loved ones are suffering now, Strolla said. He acknowledged, too, the pain felt by Davis' family.","Michael Dunn is convicted on three counts of attempted second-degree murder .

"(CNN)An Indianapolis Colts linebacker charged with felony rape ""unhesitatingly denies all allegations,"" according to a Thursday statement from the player's lawyer. The Colts announced they have placed Joshua McNary, who they signed as a free agent in April 2013, on the Exempt/Commissioner Permission list, so he will not be allowed to play in the team's upcoming playoff matchups, but he will continue to be paid, in accordance with the National Football League's updated personal conduct policy. McNary was released early Thursday, according to the Marion County, Indiana, jail website. He posted a $25,000 bond and was ordered to wear an ankle bracelet for GPS monitoring, said Peg McLeish, a spokeswoman for the county prosecuting attorney. He appeared at an initial hearing at which a preliminary not guilty plea was entered for him, she said. His next court date is a March 11 pretrial conference. Defense attorney Edward Schrager said he would not be commenting further on the case, but said in his statement that the charges and affidavit ""are not evidence of wrongdoing, but simply one side's story. ""Joshua has full faith and confidence in the American way, including its justice system, which he pledged to protect and defend as a West Point graduate and lieutenant in the United States Army."" McNary, 26, was taken into police custody and charged with felony rape, felony criminal confinement and misdemeanor battery resulting in bodily injury. According to a probable cause affidavit, a 29-year-old woman reported to police on the morning of December 1 that she was raped hours earlier at the apartment of a man she met at a bar. The woman recounted having numerous drinks at three establishments before she arrived at the apartment, and she didn't remember exactly how she got there, the affidavit says. She recalled ""being flirty"" and ""touchy-feely"" as she and the man kissed, she told police. ""This wasn't a problem and it was not aggressive,"" she said, according to the affidavit. Soon, though, she told the man that she ""needed to lay down"" because she was ""really drunk,"" the affidavit says. She lay in the man's bed, and he began kissing her, which made her uncomfortable, and she noticed that he had taken his shirt off and she was ""completely naked,"" she told police. ""No. I'm too drunk for this. I need to lay down. I have to work, and I'm not OK with this,"" she recalled telling the man, according to the affidavit. She said she told the man several times she didn't want to have sex and fought with him, scratching him on the face, neck, back and shoulder. The man initially tried to talk her into it, and then forced her to have sex on his bed, she told police. She told the man she wanted to leave on multiple occasions, but he wouldn't let her, at one point, saying, ""You're gonna stay,"" the affidavit says. She eventually left the apartment and mistakenly took the man's cell phone with her, she told police . A forensic nurse examined the woman and found injuries to her vagina and dried blood behind one ear. The document indicates detectives used the cell phone to identify McNary the next day. When police arrived to search his apartment, he pointed to a pile of bedding in front of a washer and told police, ""I preserved it for you because I knew you would be coming."" He had also taken photos of the sheets, in particular ""blood stains and other soiled areas of the bedding,"" the affidavit says. McNary was cooperative, police indicated, and he asked for a lawyer after being advised of his rights. A nurse found abrasions and scratches on his stomach, back, neck and shoulder, the document says. Investigators also found the woman's clothing and an earring in McNary's apartment. The Colts said they were aware of the incident, but that was the ""limit of our knowledge."" The team was working to gather facts before forming an opinion, the statement said. Colts spokesman Avis Roper said that after reviewing documents surrounding ""the very serious criminal charges,"" the team asked Commissioner Roger Goodell to place McNary on the exemption list. ""If the request is granted, Josh will not be eligible to practice or attend games with the Club while designated as Commissioner Exempt. That designation will permit the investigation provided by the League's Personal Conduct Policy to run its course and will afford Josh the opportunity to focus on his defense against the charges,"" the statement said. A later statement confirmed McNary had been placed on the list. The National Football League said the matter is ""under review."" Recently, the NFL revised its personal conduct policy. It includes a minimum six-game suspension for crimes involving violent conduct, including domestic violence and sexual assault. The league reviewed its stance after widespread criticism of its handling of the Ray Rice case. McNary is listed as a second-string inside linebacker for the Colts, who play the New England Patriots on Sunday in the AFC championship game. He has 28 tackles -- mostly on special teams -- in 15 games this season. The 6-foot, 251-pound player is in his second season. He played college football at Army and served in the military from 2011 to 2013 before joining the Colts. CNN's Jill Martin, Susan Candiotti, Tina Burnside, Dave Alsup, Erica Henry and Wayne Sterling contributed to this report.","Preliminary not guilty plea entered for the 26-year-old linebacker .

"Back in 2010, Google launched a short-lived social network service called ""Buzz."" Instead of simply promoting Buzz and urging users to sign up for it, or opt in, Google chose instead to sign up Gmail users as Buzz users. If users weren't happy, they could always opt out. It was a mess. Private e-mail addresses became publicly available as social network contacts. Users rebelled. The Federal Trade Commission investigated, Google backed off, and eventually the company settled with the FTC and agreed not to rope users into new services that they haven't signed up for. Now Google is back at it. This week the company announced that it was tying the inboxes of Gmail users to  Google+ users. By using Gmail addresses to autocomplete messages from Google+ users, Google is basically giving strangers who may not know your e-mail address a way to connect with you through Gmail. This move may bolster short-term value for Google but reduces privacy for Gmail users. This announcement is partly about the ongoing competition with Facebook, but it is also about Google's increasing integration of user data across various Internet services. That happened when Google decided to revise its privacy policy for Gmail and other Google products so that it could target more advertising and do more profiling of users. The consequences for users and for the Internet are troubling. From a privacy perspective, Google's action makes it more likely that personal information of users will become more widely available. And as the Internet's most dominant company, Google is exploiting its control over key Internet services to beat back competition and expand its market reach. Those who favor a free, open and democratic Internet should take note. Google is also unfairly expecting Gmail users to opt out of a service they never signed up for to maintain their current expectations of privacy. It's fine if some users like the new feature. They should be free to opt in. But those who value privacy should not be expected to check their privacy settings every time a company alters its business model. With the latest change to Gmail, Google is testing the resolve of regulators to protect privacy. If government officials do not intervene, things could get much worse. At the moment, Google is simply using Gmail account addresses to auto-complete e-mail addresses for Google+. But of course Google is sitting on the biggest search database in the world and could also use that data it has collected from users to auto-complete e-mail addresses and much more. In 2010, Google was right to back off the plan for Buzz and the Federal Trade Commission was right to pursue an investigation and help ensure that similar fiascos do not occur. But now that Google is once again commingling data in e-mail accounts and social network accounts, the Federal Trade Commission will need to intervene. Opting out is not the solution.","Google+ users can now e-mail people without knowing their e-mail address .

"(CNN)When the sound of gunfire rattled out of the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris, it looked like the systematic murder of cartoonists and staff at the satirical magazine could have been the work of lone wolf extremists, two brothers named Said and Cherif Kouachi. When a policewoman was gunned down the next day, police first thought the incident was unrelated. But when that gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, took hostages at a kosher supermarket the next day, demanding that police stand down from a siege of the Kouachi brothers happening just outside the city, a web of connections started to become clear. And as investigators look into the horrific events that shook France and the world this month, it becomes clear that the links spread from Paris out to Yemen, Syria, Iraq and beyond. A week after the Charlie Hebdo killings, al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, said that it had planned and funded the attack years earlier. In a video message, AQAP credited the American-born radical preacher Anwar al-Awlaki with giving the orders before he was killed in 2011. Separately, a video emerged that appeared to show Coulibaly pledging allegiance to the leader of another terror group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-proclaimed caliph of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Through legal papers, jihadi websites, press reports and its own investigations, CNN has pieced together other connections. When they were in their 20s, the Kouachi brothers were part of a circle of Parisian Islamists inspired by Farid Beyettoun, police allege in court papers seen by CNN. Later, Cherif Kouachi was in jail with Djamel Beghal, who was accused of being a top al Qaeda recruiter. Coulibaly and his wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, often visited Beghal when he got out of prison, as did Kouachi. Both Kouachi brothers and Coulibaly are dead, but Boumeddiene is on the run, and investigators are continuing to look into who knows whom, and what the connections could reveal. CNN's Scott Bronstein and Florence Davey-Attlee contributed to this report.","Attackers' links to terrorism reach Yemen, Syria, Iraq and beyond .

"New Delhi, India (CNN)Up to 80 bodies, mostly decomposed skeletons, surfaced in the Ganges, which is India's holiest river after its water level went down on Tuesday, authorities said. Some of the corpses were half-burnt, and many just skeletal remains, said Saumya Agarwal, the chief of the riverside district of Unnao where the bodies were recovered. ""Most of them are believed to be very old."" In Hinduism and some other Indian faiths, funerals are conducted by cremation. The ashes are then scattered into rivers. The Ganges, Hinduism's holiest river, is dotted with numerous cremation spots along its shores. A full Hindu funeral costs up to 7,000 Rupees (around $110), Agarwal said. Sometimes, poor people cremate their dead with limited firewood as a ritual and float the partly-burnt bodies into the river, she said. Many people also bury dead children and unwed women in graves along the river. ""These bodies and decomposed skeletons from dismantled graves surfaced when the water level dropped as low as to the riverbed,"" she said. All remains have now been buried in the riverbed at the same site, Agrawal added. The Ganges, India's most sacred and polluted river, originates from a glacier in the Himalayas. It passes through Varanasi, one of the most sacred Hindu centers. As part of his executive plans, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to clean up the Ganges -- called the Ganga in Hindi -- with a range of measures, including a special ministry and a fund. Efforts to contain river pollution date back to 1986, but little success has been achieved. India has also launched what it calls a National Mission for Clean Ganga involving various stakeholders, including religious figures and environmentalists.

"Apparently sexism isn't just a social problem -- if you're in the path of a hurricane, gender bias might actually kill you. A study suggests people prepare differently for hurricanes depending on whether the storm has a male or female name. ""Feminine-named hurricanes (vs. masculine-named hurricanes) cause significantly more deaths, apparently because they lead to a lower perceived risk and consequently less preparedness,"" a team of researchers wrote in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In other words, a hurricane named ""Priscilla"" might not make people flee like a hurricane named ""Bruno"" would. The study analyzed death rates from U.S. hurricanes from 1950 to 2012. It suggests that changing a severe hurricane's name from Charley to Eloise could nearly triple its death toll. ""For severe storms, where taking protective action would have the greatest potential to save lives, the masculinity-femininity of a hurricane's name predicted its death toll,"" the study said. Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which left more than 1,800 people dead, was not included in the study because it was considered a statistical outlier. Neither was Hurricane Audrey in 1957, which killed 416 people. The study does note that both of those very deadly hurricanes had female names. Forecasters: Fewer storms in the Atlantic this year? Questioning the data . But not everyone buys the team's hypothesis. Jeff Lazo of the National Centre for Atmospheric Research said the pattern is most likely a statistical fluke, according to National Geographic. He notes that all hurricanes had female names until 1979 -- meaning the study included 29 years without male hurricane names. That's significant because hurricanes have generally gotten less deadly over time, Lazo told National Geographic. ""It could be that more people die in female-named hurricanes simply because more people died in hurricanes on average before they started getting male names,"" Lazo said. Study: Experiments back up the claim . But the researchers said they didn't just analyze death tolls from actual hurricanes, they also conducted a series of experiments to test their hypothesis. In one experiment, participants predicted the intensity of 10 hurricanes -- five with female names and five with male names. The male hurricanes were deemed more intense -- regardless of the gender of the participant. In another test, participants were asked to judge the risks of a hypothetical ""Hurricane Alexander"" and a ""Hurricane Alexandra."" Despite being told both had uncertain intensity, respondents considered Hurricane Alexander to be riskier. A third experiment tested whether participants would be more likely to evacuate due to a ""Hurricane Christopher"" vs. a ""Hurricane Christina."" As expected, more people would flee their homes if Hurricane Christopher came barreling toward them compared to an impending Hurricane Christina. Why name hurricanes anyway? Giving hurricanes short, easy-to-remember names helps reduce confusion when two or more tropical storms are brewing at the same time, the National Hurricane Center said. For decades, all hurricanes were given female names in part because hurricanes were unpredictable, the study said, citing the ""Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons and Cyclones."" ""This practice came to an end in the late 1970s with increasing societal awareness of sexism, and an alternating male-female naming system was adopted,"" the report said. Each year's list of hurricane names is alphabetical, alternating between male and female monikers. If you're trying to get your name on the hurricane list, don't bother. A U.N. World Meteorlogical Organization committee has already set up six years' worth of names. The lists repeat after each six-year cycle. ""The only time that there is a change is if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for obvious reasons of sensitivity,"" the National Hurricane Center said. This year's list of names include ""Omar"" and ""Sally."" It's unclear how people might prepare differently if caught in the paths of those storms. Breaking down the climate report by region .

"(CNN) -- Militants gunned down 10 soldiers at a military checkpoint in southwestern Yemen, authorities said Thursday. The incident occurred Wednesday in the town of Lawdar, security officials said. In an unrelated incident Wednesday, the Yemen Defense Ministry said it had killed Waleed Osairi, an al Qaeda commander, along with several other suspected al Qaeda militants. The deaths occurred in Abyan province and is part of an effort to clear the area of the terror group, the government said. Yemen has been consumed by unrest for months as protesters have demanded an end to the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule. Saleh and other senior officials were wounded June 3 in an attack on the mosque at the presidential palace. Saleh is being treated in Saudi Arabia. Officials have said he will return when he has recovered. In recent weeks, government troops have battled both tribal forces and Islamic militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

"(CNN)They were two rising stars of American skiing -- colorful personalities with bright hopes for the future. Their deaths in an avalanche at a resort in the Austrian Alps have left their friends on the U.S. Ski Team in shock. ""I haven't cried like this in a very long time,"" Katie Ryan, a member of the Alpine B Team, wrote on her blog, in a post titled ""Ski in Peace Boys."" Ronnie Berlack, 20, and Bryce Astle, 19 were two development-level ski racers who were among six people skiing when the avalanche struck. The four others were able to ski out of danger. ""The sudden deaths of Ronnie and Bryce will shake the entire Ski Racing community as it has shaken me,"" Ryan wrote on her blog. ""They were funny oddballs, great teammates and fierce competitors. I have no doubt they would have gone on the race World Cup and beyond,"" she wrote. ""My heart breaks for their families, for the teammates who witnessed it all and for their coaches."" It's a ""very sad day for the U.S. Ski Team, said head men's coach Sasha Rearick on CNN Tuesday. ""We're holding strong as a family together. For sure it's been an emotional 24 hours."" Hopes for future . In his last post on Instagram, Astle hinted at his hopes for the coming year and beyond. ""2014 was definitely badass...but 2015 will be badasser,"" said his caption on a photo of sunlight bursting over craggy snow-covered mountains. The post, from five days ago, said he had ended the year at the Alta Ski Area in Utah and was next heading ""off to Europe!"" One of the hashtags he added was #roadtopyeongchang, a reference to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Astle, from Sandy, Utah, had been invited to train with the development team. He was 13th in giant slalom at the U.S. Alpine Championships last March, ending as the top junior. Skier Devin Davis, who roomed with Astle at U.S. nationals, called him ""sunshine on a cloudy day."" ""He showed me the joy of the sport and the love and the passion and made me want to come back and keep skiing,"" Davis told CNN affiliate KSL. ""Brice always had a smile on his face, always enjoyed whatever he was doing -- whether it was training hard or hanging with friends,"" said Rearick. Berlack, from Franconia, New Hampshire, was named to the U.S. Ski Team's Development Team after a spring 2013 tryout camp. He finished 11th in downhill and 17th in super G at the 2013 U.S. Alpine Championships in Squaw Valley, California. An autographed photo of Berlack hangs in Franconia Village Store. ""He was a fine young man,"" owner Steve Heath told CNN affiliate WMUR. ""Always had a big smile on his face. We're always real happy to see him. The type of kid that would come in and say, 'Hi Steve,' and look right at you.'"" Heath said Berlack was in the store during the holidays. His parents and sister live in the town, WMUR reported. The skier told the store owner that he was heading to Europe to ski the Europa races, the affiliate said. Berlack had attended Burke Mountain Academy in Vermont, which released a statement saying that the skier was ""loved and deeply respected"" and praising his ""huge spirit."" ""He was a talent, but more than a talent, he was someone who didn't see limitations,"" school headmaster Kirk Dwyer told WMUR. ""And he thought that if he wanted to achieve something, he just set his mind out to do it, and generally he did."" ""Everyone loved [Berlack's] enthusiasm for being part of the team,"" said Rearick. Rescuers 'tried everything to save them' Hansjoerg Posch, a cable car manager at the resort in Soelden where the two Americans were killed, said they and the other four skiers left the safe slopes and went out into an open area Monday. There had been a lot of wind over the past few days that had moved new snow into the area before the avalanche, Posch told CNN. The avalanche risk was set at level 3 out of 5, with warnings on TV and radio not to go off piste, he said. A team of around 60 rescuers, including dogs and two helicopters, took 40 to 50 minutes to find Astle and Berlack, Posch said, adding that it took so long because the two Americans weren't wearing gear that sends out signals to rescuers after avalanches. Four U.S. men's skiers tried immediately to rescue their teammates. ""The amount of strength and courage that those individuals demonstrated was remarkable,"" said Rearick. The searchers eventually found the two men about 3 to 4 meters (10 to 13 feet) under the snow, he said. The rescue team ""tried everything to save them"" but without success, Posch said. Tom Kelly, the vice president of communications with the U.S. Ski Team, said the four surviving skiers had no injuries -- ""none whatsoever."" Ryan talked on her blog about the risk that skiers face from avalanches. ""It could have been any one or all of those six boys caught in that avalanche,"" she said. ""It could have been any two of my teammates. It could have been me.""

"(CNN)Twenty-five year old Lujain al-Hathloul -- a Saudi holding a valid UAE driver's license -- drives from Abu Dhabi to Saudi Arabia's border and attempts to cross on November 30 as a form of protest at Saudi Arabia's driving ban for women. Saudi authorities hold the activist in her car overnight, confiscate her passport, and then jail her on the morning of December 1. She remains in prison, according to Human Rights Watch. According to some reports, the accusations against al-Hathloul are focused on her social media activity rather than her driving. A prominent Shiite cleric calls for peaceful rallies against what he calls systemic discrimination against the Shiite minority in Saudi Arabia. The Gulf state sentences Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr to death in October for ""breaking allegiance with the ruler,"" ""inciting sectarian strife,"" and supporting violence, Saudi officials tell CNN. Nimr's family accused the court of a politically motivated decision and continue to appeal the verdict. A blogger starts the ""Free Saudi Liberals"" forum in 2008 to encourage discussion about Islam and particularly the intrusion of the religious police in personal lives. A Jeddah court convicts Raif al-Badawi of ""insulting Islam"" and hands down a 10-year prison term and 1,000 lashes. Prison for female driving, death for dissent, lashes for liberalism - these are some of the punishments, human rights groups say, Saudi Arabia has handed down in recent months. A key ally in the U.S. led coalition against ISIS -- a terror group known to behead, flog, and crucify its victims -- Saudi Arabia faces accusations of hypocrisy for institutionalizing what some consider similar acts of barbarity. Under the country's Sharia or Islamic law system, these practices are acceptable ways to penalize criminals convicted by the Saudi judiciary. The country's friends in the West are also under fire for meek condemnations after Badawi endured the first of 20 consecutive weekly floggings in Jeddah. ""Canada is deeply concerned by the public flogging of Raif Badawi. This punishment is a violation of human dignity and freedom of expression, and we call for clemency in this case,"" Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister said in a statement. While Mr. Badawi is not a Canadian citizen, we will continue to make our position known, both publicly and through diplomatic channels."" The U.S. State Department described the sentence as ""inhumane."" In a statement it said: ""The United States Government calls on Saudi authorities to cancel this brutal punishment and to review Badawi's case and sentence. The United States strongly opposes laws, including apostasy laws, that restrict the exercise of these freedoms, and urges all countries to uphold these rights in practice."" Madawi al-Rasheed, a Professor at the Middle East Center of the London School of Economics, told CNN's Becky Anderson this week: ""None of those countries are willing to challenge Saudi Arabia as they challenge other countries deemed as opposed to the West."" Al-Rasheed said: ""The United States adopts double standards when it deals with a country like Saudi Arabia because of the importance of Saudi Arabia for U.S. interests and for European interest."" The defiant Gulf State says its judiciary is independent and impartial and bases its sentencing on Islamic law, a system freely and willingly chosen by the sovereign state. ""The Kingdom is proud and cherishes Islamic law and its constitutional curriculum, where justice and the preservation of rights is ensured for all beings made by the Almighty Creator,"" Mohammed al-Muadi, of the government backed Saudi Human Rights Commission told CNN. The Riyadh government drew the ire of the international community when a video surfaced last year purporting to show a beheading by sword, the predominate form of execution. The country executed 87 people in 2014 most by decapitation, Human Rights Watch told CNN. ""The Kingdom will not back down on the issue of justice, the issue of applying the rules of God,  particularly in capital cases.  And no sentence is carried out without providing the full legal right to the defendant,"" said al-Muadi. Under Saudi interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence charges of murder fall under a system of retribution which allows the family of the victim to choose the fate of the perpetrator. Relatives may accept ""diyya"" meaning blood money instead of the death penalty. ""We emphasize respect for the right to life as one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the law. It should not make us forget the rights of other parties violated by the perpetrators, which has to be seen with the same degree of respect, ""al-Muadi said when asked specifically about the practice of beheadings. Last month, Saudi executioners cut off Filipino worker Carlito Lana's head for killing his employer in 2010, a CNN affiliate in the Philippines reported. The Lana family said the father of three acted in self-defense. The Department of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines says that the family of the victim opted for the death penalty, rather than accept any money from Lana and initially tried to raise funds to pay the Saudi relatives. ""This is a dark day for migrant Filipinos, especially for those on death row abroad,"" a statement by the group Migrante International, which defends the rights of workers abroad, said. The statement added that the case highlighted the ""vulnerability of migrant laborers."" The scheduled flogging of Raif Badawi -- for blogging about the discussion of faith -- has begun. Every Friday, he will be flogged 50 times, until his sentence of 1,000 lashings is complete. In the unverified video of the public act, a man in uniform can be seen striking a shackled prisoner with a cane as a crowd gathers around. Men in the crowd whispered ""he spoke about God and his Prophet"" shortly before the flogging. Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, said the video was difficult to watch. ""It's a scene I cannot describe. It was horrible,"" she said from Canada. ""Every lash killed me,"" she told CNN. The flogging again shines the spotlight on the nation that analysts say effectively manipulates its justice system to silence dissent and create strife among opposition on both sides of the aisle. U.S. officials have also called on Saudi officials to withdraw the sentence and review Badawi's case. But Saudi Arabia maintains its right to carry out their laws. ""Raif Badawi and others with charges against them are afforded all legal rights including the right to attorney,"" said Saudi Arabia's Mohammed al-Muadi. But analysts say it's as much about the internal conflict within the country. ""The case of Raif al Badawi tells us a great deal about the polarization in Saudi society between the Islamists and the liberals,"" Professor Madawi al-Rasheed explained. ""The Saudi regime tries to appease both by showing as if it is equal in punishing both groups that endorse discourse or opposition.""","The Flogging of liberal blogger Raif Badawi has placed a spotlight on Saudi Arabia's justice system .

"If the CIA did, in fact, secretly remove classified documents from Senate computers during an oversight probe, there will be consequences, the chairman of the House Intelligence committee told CNN Wednesday. ""We're going to have to unwind this, find out what the truth is,"" Republican Mike Rogers of Michigan told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" ""If someone broke the law, they're going to have to pay the penalty."" Rogers' comments followed Tuesday's accusation by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, that the CIA removed some documents from her staff's computers in the middle of an oversight investigation. Feinstein said the CIA searched Senate computers last year because they believed the panel's investigators might have gained access to materials on an internal review they were not authorized to see.  The committee launched a full-blown investigation after learning in an initial review that the CIA had ""withheld and destroyed information about its detention and interrogation program."" Her concern is that the search may have violated federal law regarding domestic spying as well as congressional oversight responsibilities under the Constitution. Just the fact that Feinstein would publicly make the accusation indicates there is something to it, Rogers said. ""It's troubling to see this, but I do have immense respect for Sen. Feinstein,"" Rogers said. ""If she's going down to the floor, she clearly believes that something untoward happened."" CIA Director John Brennan, speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations Tuesday, denied the accusations, saying ""nothing could be further from the truth."" Rogers expressed concern about the situation, but declined to speculate. On one hand, he said, there is a need to get to the bottom of the accusations so that it doesn't prevent the CIA from doing its work. On the other hand, if laws were broken, it would destroy the legislative-CIA relationship, he said. The Inspector General has referred to the issue to the Department of Justice, he said. The Justice Department is looking at whether to launch an investigation involving the committee's review of millions of documents at a Virginia facility and counterclaims by the CIA about Intelligence Committee staffers gaining access to things they shouldn't have seen. There is plenty of oversight cooperation between the CIA and Congress, Rogers said, and these accusations should not taint the entire agency. Feinstein says CIA spied on Senate computers . Opinion: Feinstein is no bomb thrower .","Rep. Mike Rogers wants to get to the bottom of the accusations against CIA .

"KARACHI, Pakistan (CNN) -- Vowing to help return democracy to Pakistan, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto ended eight years of self-imposed exile and returned Thursday to her native country, where she was greeted by a massive crowd of supporters. Former Pakistani PM Benazir Bhutto cries upon landing at Karachi International Airport Thursday. Shortly after arriving in the southern port city of Karachi, Bhutto entered the bustling city streets in an armored motorcade for protection against the crush of supporters celebrating her arrival. Bhutto said she was ""emotionally overwhelmed"" by the welcome, but she wasted no time addressing the political situation in Pakistan. Minutes after her arrival at Karachi International Airport, Bhutto called for a return to democracy to repair Pakistan's tarnished image as a haven for terrorists. ""The people that you see outside are the real image of Pakistan,"" she told reporters. ""These are the decent, hard-working, middle classes and working classes of Pakistan who want to be in power so that they can build a moderate modern nation where everybody has equality. ""This is the real Pakistan, and if we get democracy, this is the face of Pakistan the world will see, not the face of extremists who have thrived under dictatorships."" ""I hope I can live up to the great expectations which people here have,"" she said. Her arrival comes amid death threats, which she told CNN were the result of ""the rise of extremism"" and a ""fear"" of her return. ""I am aware of the threats for my security, and this has been discussed with (President) General Pervez Musharraf,"" Bhutto told CNN's Mohsin Naqvi Wednesday. However, Bhutto warned of ""hidden hands"" that would take action ""if any untoward action happens."" The threats come as the result of ""certain people who have gained a lot through dictatorship,"" she said, referring to Musharraf's grip on power. ""They have presided over the rise of extremism, they have created safe havens in the tribal areas of Pakistan for the Taliban and other militants, and they fear my return."" The streets of Karachi were packed with tens of thousands of supporters waving banners, dancing and chanting slogans calling for Bhutto as the next prime minister. An independent analyst and journalist in Pakistan told CNN that Thursday's reception was one of the country's biggest. See . While there have been no official numbers, Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party estimated more than a million people turned out to greet the former Pakistani premier. Moved by the massive crowd, Bhutto said ""I can't believe how many people are outside that can see me. This is the most memorable moment in my life."" Hear Bhutto talk with CNN by phone upon arriving in Pakistan » . Throngs of police and security guards fortified the city, strategically placed on rooftops and other posts in efforts to secure a peaceful homecoming. In addition, side streets were blocked with barriers. Riding in a bulletproof truck, Bhutto led a caravan to the tomb of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, despite requests by authorities not to. See crowds gathered around Bhutto's bulletproof truck as welders add finishing touches . Several hours after her arrival, the caravan had only moved a short distance, not even clearing the airport premises. The motorcade will travel some 20 km (12 miles) to the tomb, and it may take until Friday morning before she reaches it due to the dense congestion, Pakistani officials said. Bhutto will eventually travel to her home in an upscale area near the coast. The 54-year-old Bhutto, the first woman ever to lead an Islamic nation, hopes to secure a third term as prime minister after January elections -- possibly under a power-sharing deal with Musharraf, who has seen his support plummet in recent months. Bhutto's adviser has said she wants only a return to democracy. Earlier this month, Musharraf cleared the way for Bhutto's return after agreeing to drop outstanding corruption charges against the former prime minister and a number of other politicians, as part of his own bid to stay in power. A union with Bhutto would allow Musharraf to stave off criticism about his grip on power, which would be significantly weakened if he stands by his pledge to abandon his position as military chief. He overwhelming won a third term as Pakistan's president earlier in October in a parliamentary vote. Bhutto has said she would only join Musharraf's government if he abandons his military post, which he has vowed to do sometime before he is sworn into office on Nov. 15. The Bush administration continues to support Musharraf, whom it views as a key ally in the war on terrorism. However, administration officials have toned down that support in recent months after intelligence assessments indicated Musharraf's agreement with tribal leaders gave al Qaeda and Taliban militants free rein along the Afghan border. That agreement has since been scrapped and the Pakistani military has resumed operations in the tribal regions. Despite seeking a power-sharing deal with Musharraf, Bhutto continues to criticize the Pakistani leader for allowing terrorists to thrive in the western tribal regions. Some of Bhutto's critics warn that her desire to return to office is not simply about restoring democracy in Pakistan. Karachi-based social scientist S. Akbar Zaidi said he doesn't think Bhutto ""has any democratic sentiment in her at all."" ""This is a way to power in Pakistan -- you make a deal with whoever happens to be in power,"" he said. ""It's got nothing to do with democracy. I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. has been promoting this liaison between Musharraf and Benazir, hoping that it will bring democracy.""

"Manila, Philippines (CNN)Weighing in on last week's terror in France and the debate over freedom of expression it stirred, Pope Francis said en route to the Philippines that killing ""in the name of God"" is wrong, but it is also wrong to ""provoke"" people by belittling their religion. The Pope stressed that there was no justification for the killing of 17 people in three separate incidents, including a massacre in and around the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The assailants were reportedly Islamist extremists, some of whom called out ""Allahu akbar,"" which is Arabic for ""God is great,"" as they singled out the magazine, French authorities and Jewish people. ""One cannot make war (or) kill in the name of one's own religion,"" Francis said on his way to the Philippines. ""... To kill in the name of God is an aberration."" Still, even as he decried the violence and generally spoke in support of freedom of expression, the pontiff said that such freedom must have its limits. He didn't mention Charlie Hebdo specifically, or its cartoon depictions of Mohammed, something that many Muslims find offensive. A previous cartoon was one reason the Paris magazine was targeted, and it didn't back down afterward, with its post-attack cover showing Mohammed again, this time crying and holding a sign with the rallying cry ""Je suis Charlie,"" French for ""I am Charlie."" Still, even without talking about the magazine by name, the Pope prefaced his remarks by saying, ""let's go to Paris, let's speak clearly."" He then referred to recent violence there, as well as the debate about freedom of expression. Francis said on his flight from Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Manila that everyone had not only the liberty, but also the obligation, ""to say what he thinks to help the common good."" But he added that this should be done without giving offense, because human dignity should be respected. If a friend ""says a swear word against my mother, then a punch awaits him,"" Francis said. Vatican Radio reported that he then ""gestured with a pretend punch"" directed at the friend, Alberto Gasbarri -- an action that many journalists interpreted as a joke. Vatican spokesman Thomas Rosica later told CNN the remark was ""spoken colloquially,"" adding the Pope wasn't advocating violence or in any way justifying the terror attacks. Right after the punch gesture, Francis said, ""It's normal, it's normal. ""One cannot provoke, one cannot insult other people's faith, one cannot make fun of faith."" Later, Francis arrived in the Philippines, Asia's most Catholic nation and one hungry for his arrival. Everything from the country's supreme court to backstreet businesses have closed down, but the streets have come alive. People have been pouring into the capital from all over the country to greet the head of the Catholic Church as he starts his five-day visit. On street corners, in malls, on public transport, it's impossible not to feel the presence of the Pope. Giant billboards with an official red and blue ""Pope logo"" adorn many of Manila's buildings, while curbside vendors sell images of his smiling face on everything from stamps and towels to fans and key chains. Filipinos have been granted a national holiday for the visit, the coast guard has declared a no-sail zone within a mile of Manila Bay, many of the capital's main roads will be closed, and Manila's airport has limited its operations. An estimated 40,000 security personnel will be deployed to keep the Pope safe during his time in Manila and Leyte, where he will celebrate Mass in Tacloban, a city still coming to terms with the devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan a year ago. Pope Francis' visit is being billed as one of ""mercy and compassion."" But in a country where a conservative church has fought strongly against legislation allowing government distribution of birth control, as well as the legalization of divorce, some Filipinos hope this pontiff's more open-minded approach might lead to change. READ MORE: Cardinal: Pope says visit not about him . Young people, such as John Laureta, a 24-year-old student who is traveling six hours to see the Pope in the capital, says he's the kind of leader in the church that the young need. ""He's approachable, listens and answers questions, explains and does not ignore questions that are controversial,"" he said. Ginelle Peterson, also 24, agreed. ""Since he is not so black-and-white, it makes us think, 'I want to hear more of what he has to say about this,'"" she said. Indeed, for many people in the Philippines, having a head of church with these qualities is welcome. Anthony J. Vizmanos, 25, was asked to leave his home when he came out as gay to his ""deeply religious"" parents. He said he still prays, goes to church and receives sacraments but has been driven away by what he calls irony in the church's teachings. ""The church says it's OK to be gay as long as you don't engage in homosexual acts. But if you say you accept us for being gay, then why are you stopping us from acting gay? We are not plants that photosynthesize. We need love and affection, too."" Vizmanos, who went to Catholic schools for most of his life, told CNN, ""I no longer join Catholic community groups. I practice what I know and believe instead of what they are telling me to believe."" One woman, who described herself as a ""modern"" Catholic but preferred to remain anonymous, said the Vatican hierarchy needs to be revamped. ""The Pope is introducing changes that the ancient church needs to keep in step with the 21st century. There are too many antiquated, irrelevant rules that turn off the youth. This Pope is a breath of fresh air."" The church's staunch position on artificial birth control -- that it's a sin and will relax moral standards -- is an example. ""A woman should have the right to decide what form to use to prevent unwanted pregnancies,"" she added. ""Birth control is not abortion!"" Vizmanos says he feels the church in the Philippines is less tolerant than the Pope and hopes its clergy will become more moderate after his visit. ""A priest near my home says in each homily that gay people are condemned to damnation,"" he said. ""I hope the Pope can shed some humility to people like him. The church here is too rooted in their causes, whereas the Pope is more accepting."" One of the most divisive issues in the Philippines in recent years is a controversial bill that addresses birth control. The Reproductive Health Bill, which allows the government to distribute and educate the public about artificial birth control, finally passed last year after a 14-year battle, but the fight with the church and more conservative elements in the Philippines over its implementation continues today. READ MORE: A 14-year fight for birth control . Christine Gomez, 48, who works for a women's youth organization, does not believe in divorce or birth control. ""Of course we have problems, but introducing these things will not solve them. It's better to educate people in virtues like chastity or fortitude -- learning to face difficulties without giving up easily."" Although media have widely reported the Pope making what could be considered more liberal comments about controversial issues such as birth control, homosexuality and divorce -- which is illegal here -- he has not actually made any changes to church policy. Father Catalino Arevalo, a prominent Filipino theologian, says Pope Francis has just started changing how he handles his people. ""He just said that you should openly discuss these things; let everybody have the chance to talk. But then, when the discussion is over, he and his advisers will make a decision, but the decisions have not been made."" Catholics like Ginelle Peterson hope that the Pope's progressive approach may one day lead to the right to divorce. But Teodoro Bacani Jr., bishop emeritus of Novaliches, says divorce -- which critics say will ruin the family, a cornerstone of Filipino life and faith -- is something that will never be allowed. READ MORE: The fight to make divorce legal . ""I don't think the Pope will even hint to Filipino bishops and say: 'Hey guys, soften up on this, will you?' Because this would not be in accord with the Catholic spirit and teachings. I am sure he will never agree to gay marriage either,"" he said. Peterson says he believes it's about trust and being open to different interpretations. ""Don't you trust your people enough to give them a choice? If I was solid in my faith and didn't believe in divorce, then I would not do it,"" she said. ""You can't define a family from the dictionary. Does that mean if you grew up with just a father that it's not family? That you were not taken care of, or protected or loved?""

"(CNN)NASA is sending astronaut Scott Kelly to live on the International Space Station for a year. That's the longest any U.S. astronaut has spent in space and twice as long as crew members usually stay on the space station. A year is a long time to stay anyplace. But staying a year in space has some special challenges. There's what to pack: How many changes of clothes do you bring? Kelly says NASA supplies most of what he needs but he's taking his own tool pouch, some sweatshirts and special shoes to use when he's lifting weights. ""I bought a special kind of shoes I thought would be better for that,"" Kelly said at a NASA briefing on Thursday. Then there's what to do for a year in space. You get a great view of Earth, so the scenery is amazing. But the space station orbits Earth about every 90 minutes, or about 16 times a day. Could get a little repetitive. So how do you keep from getting bored? Experiments. Lots and lots of experiments. NASA says space station crews normally work on about 200 experiments over six months, but Kelly will be doing many more. He says he's actually fascinated with the space station itself as a giant experiment in living in space. ""Building this facility that allows us to understand how to operate for long periods of time in space to allow us someday to go to Mars."" In his free time Kelly says he'll spend a lot of time talking to people on Earth, messaging on social media, reading email, watching TV and writing. ""I'm going to keep a personal journal of the experience,"" Kelly said. He also will share some of his journal with researchers studying the psychological impacts of long-term space flight. Will he tell all? ""I plan to be completely honest about it,"" he said, but ... ""who knows, maybe there are some crazy thoughts I'll have at the end that I wouldn't want to share."" Kelly also might get to do a bit of singing. British singer Sarah Brightman will visit the station as a space tourist during Kelly's year in orbit. Will he and the other crew members sing along with her? ""It will be either all of us or none of us,"" Kelly joked. One other thing Kelly has to plan for: near-zero gravity. Turns out our bodies really like gravity. Stay in orbit too long and your eyes, heart, bones, muscles -- basically everything -- change, and usually not for the better. On the upside, you get a bit taller. At least briefly. ""You do grow when you're up there for a long time,"" Kelly said. ""Unfortunately it doesn't last. But it did last long enough that I could stand next to my brother and look down at him a little bit."" Kelly was joking about his twin, former astronaut Mark Kelly (who is also known for being the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords). Mark Kelly has volunteered for NASA's ""Twins Study"" -- 10 investigations into how the identical twins change over the year in two very different environments. Even though Mark will be on Earth getting poked and prodded by researchers while Scott makes history in orbit, Scott said his brother doesn't mind. ""He thinks it's great that he can still be a participant in this,"" Scott Kelly said. The Kelly brothers' experiments should help NASA understand what happens to astronauts who spend a long time in space and help plan longer spaceflights to an asteroid or to Mars. Despite all the health risks and personal sacrifices, Kelly said there's a big reason to stay in space a year. ""It's a lot of fun,"" he said. ""Space station is a magical place."" The mission is a first for NASA, but not for Russia. Between 1987 and 1995, four cosmonauts spent a year or more in space. And another Russian will be with Kelly for his yearlong mission: cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko. Both men are space veterans. Kelly has flown on two shuttle missions and has already done two stints on the space station. In all, he's logged more than 180 days in space. Kornienko has spent 176 days in space. The two will ride to the space station on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka, who is staying for six months. The trio will launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 27.","Astronaut Scott Kelly to live in space one year .

"Hargeisa, Somaliland (CNN) -- In 1856, British explorer Richard Burton described Somalia as a nation of poets. It may seem an unlikely moniker for a country that has since become defined by piracy, state collapse, and the many horrors unleashed by Al-Shabaab -- the Islamic extremists who control much of the country. But, much has changed since then. Despite appearances, the country used to be one of East Africa's most dynamic artistic enclaves, and much of the region's cultural activity took place in Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, the internationally unrecognized state that broke away from Somalia in 1991. ""Hargeisa used to be the cultural hub for the Somali republic. There was a beautiful Chinese-built theater; also the main public library, at one time the biggest in Somalia,"" recalls Jama Muse Jama, who six years ago founded the Hargeisa Book Fair. The theater and library, like much of Hargeisa, was flattened during the civil war that preceded Somalia's collapse and Somaliland's declaration of independence. Now, Jama is hoping to restore some of what his country lost. ""If at the end of the fair, we have one more reader, we have succeeded,"" he says. The fair, which takes place during a week in August (this year's ended August 13), has become one of the most anticipated literary events in East Africa. Part book expo, part cultural festival (poets, musicians and dancers are as popular as the author panels), the fair attracts a variety of local literary legends like Hadraawi, widely considered the most famous living Somali poet. Outside, the hundreds in attendance throng around stalls selling new books published by the likes of the Redsea Online Publishing/Ponte Invisible -- a publishing company run by Jama -- and second-hand tomes, all to meet demand in this literature-hungry city. The city's dedication to the written word is particularly poignant, given that the Somali language didn't even have its own written alphabet until 1972. That year, Somali President Mohammed Siad Barre introduced a standard written version of the Somali language using Latin script. The Barre regime's move -- driven by a 5% literacy rate (according to the United Nations) -- represented a new approach beyond the oral poetic tradition. ""Government workers were given three months to learn. Anyone who failed was fired,"" recalls Said Salah Ahmed, an author, playwright and teacher of Somali at the University of Minnesota, who was a school principal at the time. As the campaign stretched from the cities to the towns to the smallest villages, he says teaching took place ""wherever -- under trees, under walls, wherever there was shade."" Jama also considers that period fondly. ""It was one of the best things that happened in Somali society,"" he says. While the first books to be published in the new language were mostly textbooks, there was also a smattering of European classics, with ""Animal Farm,"" ""Gulliver's Travels,"" and even Dale Carnegie's ""How To Win Friends And Influence People"" appearing on book shelves, according to Liban Ahmad, a Somali writer and teacher based in London. The period also brought on new forms of Somali literature, alongside poetry. ""Modern trends started to emerge, including original fiction works,"" recalls Mohamoud Shiekh Dalmar, who was working with the Somali Broadcasting Service. According to the UN, the Somali literacy rates climbed to 55% by the mid-1970s. Such progress wasn't sustainable though, as civil war and drought ultimately split the country. By 1990, literacy rates fell to 24%. Jama recalls books being burned at his school library. The official excuse given, he says, was that they fostered colonial sentiment, but he reasons that it was because they underlined Somaliland's separateness. ""It had been a flowering.

Saleh points out that new books are again being translated into Somali. Jama himself remains dedicated to his path: using the occasion of the 2014 fair to launch a new, permanent, European Union-funded cultural centre in Hargeisa.

"Yemen's defense minister escaped an assassination attempt Tuesday when a suicide bomber attacked his convoy, the Yemeni government said. A bomb-laden vehicle exploded at 11 a.m., targeting Gen. Mohammed Nasser Ahmed's convoy in Tawahi, Aden, along Yemen's southern coast, the Defense Ministry said. The bomber was killed. Witnesses said two explosions were heard and that clashes followed for 10 minutes. An Interior Ministry source, citing the suicide bombing and the clashes, said the attack bears the hallmarks of al Qaeda. Sultan Khaled, a witness, said, ""The explosions were powerful and the city saw hundreds of troops spreading quickly."" Within minutes of the attack, government troops had blocked all entrances into Aden and set up checkpoints. In late August, senior security officials in Abyan province said Ahmed survived an assassination attempt when a roadside bomb exploded near his vehicle, killing two of his guards. But an official in the defense minister's office at the time denied that the convoy was attacked. A senior official in Abyan said then that the ministry may have denied that attack because it did not want Abyan to be seen as outside complete government control. Tuesday's attack came as anti-government protests in Yemen continued to attract huge crowds. President Ali Abdullah Saleh returned Friday from three months in Saudi Arabia, where he received medical treatment following an assassination attempt in June. Tens of thousands took to the streets of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Monday. ""We are escalating, and soon we will march directly towards the presidential palace,"" said Tawakul Karman, a prominent revolutionist. ""The will of the people is stronger today, and Saleh is already part of the past."" But at the United Nations in New York, Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu-Bark Al-Qirbi accused opposition powers on Tuesday of using the ""tidal wave of change"" that has swept across much of the Arab world this year ""to prevent Yemen from achieving democratic change through elections."" Al-Qirbi cited unbridled population growth, poverty, drought and scarcity of water and oil -- which had been a primary source of income -- for the nation's high rates of youth unemployment. He cited the opposition's refusal to endorse Saleh's 2006 re-election, after 27 years in power, as ""the main reason for the upheaval that is taking place in Yemen."" In a televised address Sunday, Saleh blamed ""terrorists"" for recent deadly violence at anti-government protests. The motive of the ""criminal terrorists,"" he said, is ""to seize power and to steal the wealth of the country and to undermine stability."" Protesters insisted that Saleh was trying to buy himself more time in office with the remarks. Scores of protesters have been reported killed by Yemeni forces in protests in recent days. Saleh said his vice president has the authority to sign a proposal by the Gulf Cooperation Council that would result in early presidential elections. The United States has called on Yemen to follow the council's proposal. The United States, the United Nations and the European Union have called on Yemen to halt the violence and called on both sides to establish a peaceful transfer of power.","The attack bears the hallmarks of al Qaeda, an Interior Ministry source says .

"(CNN) -- If, as the popular saying goes, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, the people who run our public schools fit that description. For several generations now, schools have been failing students the same ways over and over and expecting a different result. Teachers lecture, students sit and some listen. Class happens at the same time, with the same material, and at the same pace for everyone. This is an 1890s model of education -- teaching to the ""average"" student, rather than the individual. In an age when most information and knowledge is transmitted digitally and is increasingly personalized—think about how Netflix, Pandora, Twitter and Facebook work— we should be able to do much better than that. Pioneering projects like Khan Academy, Udacity and Coursera are pointing toward a future of learning that is more like Netflix than the chalk-and-textbook system we have today. Each of them is using technology to help students learn at their own pace, on their own path, and toward their own goals. As Udacity founder Sebastian Thrun told me in an interview for my book ""Breakout,"" ""I think we found the magic formula. That may sound pretentious, but the magic formula for me is high-quality education at scale. I think we owe students a personalized, high-quality experience."" New resources like Khan Academy have enabled creative teachers to integrate digital learning into the classroom and to coach students to offer better, more personalized instruction. This ""blended learning""—having some teaching done by a teacher and some through digital learning systems—is a revolutionary concept that when effectively implemented has led to impressive learning gains, especially among students who have traditionally underperformed. Now this model is getting a boost from a forward-thinking leader in Congress. This week, Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington, introduced legislation to set up five state pilot programs to implement this new instructional method . Her idea is to harness the extraordinary progress that charter schools, along with other innovative public and Catholic schools, have had by combining teachers with personalized digital learning systems. To acquire technology and train teachers often requires an up-front investment. Rodgers' bill pledges $25 million to states in the form of block grants to set up this program. And unlike most federal spending proposals, these grants actually are investments that pay off over time. The long-term cost of educating students, which has been rising exponentially since the 1960s, declines dramatically under blended learning. Taxpayers and students win with a little help from innovation. This model works precisely because it asks much of teachers and their students. Students' skills are assessed daily or weekly through interactive systems like Khan Academy (which you can try here; it's completely free). Future lessons are tailored to fit their needs. Then teachers, armed with detailed data about each student, can lead small group and one-on-one sessions to help clear up problems. If, for example, Susie is having trouble grasping fractions, a teacher would be able to identify her difficulty, often that same day, and intervene to make sure she doesn't get left behind. Under the traditional model of education, students who are having trouble often pass from lesson to lesson, falling further and further behind until the teacher has the time to review the entire class' progress. By then, Susie has probably become frustrated and tuned out. In the case of subjects like math that build upon previous lessons, this phenomenon can be devastating. Students can fall entire grade levels behind before anyone notices they have missed basic concepts that are impeding their progress. Educators with online tools, on the other hand, can usually accelerate the pace of instruction. In some cases, students skip whole grade levels while using blended learning. The results of this method of teaching have been astounding, especially in charter schools that have adopted it early, like KIPP Empower Academy in Los Angeles. Nestled in an impoverished neighborhood where most students receive free or reduced lunch (a proxy for poverty), KIPP Empower has adopted blended learning and has seen progress that was once unthinkable. It recently scored an amazing 991 (out of 1,000 possible points) on the California Academic Performance Index. That makes KIPP Empower the top-performing school in Los Angeles County and one of the best in the state of California. Traditional public schools have also benefited from this model. Oakland Unified partnered with the Rogers Foundation to set up a similar program in a handful of inner-city schools in that district. The results are far fewer discipline problems and much better scores. At one of the pilot schools, the number of students reading at grade level actually doubled. Promising blended learning programs are underway in settings as wide-ranging as Washington, D.C., South Carolina's Horry County Schools, and Middletown, New York, according to the Lexington Institute's Don Soifer. In addition to these achievement gains, blended learning is also proving to be more cost-effective for taxpayers than the traditional model. The cost of educating each student declines in blended-learning environments, in part because schools require fewer teachers to manage the classrooms. With fewer discipline issues, students become more engaged in the material and as a result, learn better. Additionally, teachers have more free time to spend with each student. This makes classroom size rules obsolete, and since compensating teachers has been the main cost driver in education, it is a big breakthrough. Contact your member of Congress today and voice support for Rep. Rodgers' bill to help more schools start blended learning pilot programs. It's time our education system enters the 21st century.

"(CNN)Tally-ho, Marlboro Man. Best known as the rugged cowboy who starred in the Marlboro Man cigarette advertisements, Darrell Winfield died Monday at home in Wyoming at age 85. His cause of death was not listed in his obituary on a Fremont County, Wyoming, news website. Often called the most successful tobacco advertising campaign ever, the Marlboro Man appealed to American men because of his masculinity, individuality and freedom. Though some of the Marlboro Men in the famous cigarette advertisements launched in the 1950s were actors, Winfield was the real thing. Winfield was working at a Wyoming ranch in 1968 when Leo Burnett/Philip Morris Advertising came looking for real cowboys to feature in the campaign, according to his local obituary. He often wore his own clothes and provided many of the animals in the photo shoots. ""His family said he loved horses, rodeo, especially team roping, ranching, and the cowboy way of life,"" according to his obituary. ""He liked to tease, was quite a character, and never met a stranger. He collected bits and spurs, loved to read western non-fiction, history, and stories of the Native Americans."" Other Marlboro Men became disillusioned with the campaign, eventually starring in anti-smoking campaigns. At least four actors who played the iconic cowboy died of smoking-related illnesses, the Los Angeles Times reported. The Marlboro Man's run ended when the tobacco companies and state attorneys general reached a settlement in 1998 that banned the use of humans and cartoons in U.S. tobacco advertising. Yet Winfield stayed true to the brand from the time he was hired in 1968 until he died, according to his obituary. He is survived by his wife, Lennie, their six children, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild. People we lost in 2015 .","Marlboro Man Darrell Winfield was a real cowboy .

"(CNN) -- ""Breaking Bad's"" Walter White may have cleverly dodged authorities during his career as a drug kingpin, but his action figure hasn't dodged the wrath of a Florida mother. Susan Schrivjer, a mother from Fort Myers, launched a petition in early October to have White -- and other ""Breaking Bad"" action figures -- removed from Toys R Us. As of Monday morning, the Change.org request has received more than 2,000 signatures. In the petition, Schrivjer -- who wrote the appeal under the name ""Susan Myers"" -- gets right to the point. ""Toys R Us is well known around the world for their vast selection of toys for children of all ages,"" she wrote. ""However their decision to sell a Breaking Bad doll, complete with a detachable sack of cash and a bag of meth, alongside children's toys is a dangerous deviation from their family friendly values."" In an interview with CNN affiliate WFTX of Fort Myers, Schrivjer expanded on her thoughts. ""Kids mimic their action figures, if you will,"" she told the station. ""Do you want your child in an orange jumpsuit?"" Signers to her petition agree. ""It's sick that a company would design kids toys that glorify the making of meth. It's just as sick to sell them,"" wrote Jaime Keasler. ""While I support free enterprise and there may be a market for these figures, this is a children's toy store,"" said Monica Tessmer. ""It shouldn't even be a question that this is inappropriate. Not a smart move Toy r Us."" The action figures include White -- the chemistry teacher turned meth lord -- and his assistant, Jesse Pinkman, in hazmat suits, as well as White as his gun-toting alter ego, Heisenberg. It's not ""Breaking Bad"" itself, Schrivjer hastens to add. She says she was a fan of the show. ""I thought the show was great,"" she said. ""It was riveting."" But she draws the line at seeing the characters in Toys R Us. Her goal? ""Just to get those taken off the shelf and put them in an appropriate store."" ""Breaking Bad"" star Bryan Cranston, who played White, responded jokingly to Schrivjer's movement. "" 'Florida mom petitions against Toys 'R Us over Breaking Bad action figures.' I'm so mad, I'm burning my Florida Mom action figure in protest,"" he tweeted. Toys R Us has yet to respond to a CNN query. In a statement to WFTX, the toy giant said, ""The products you reference are carried in very limited quantities and the product packaging clearly notes that the items are intended for ages 15 and up.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States might replace its ambassador to Libya after WikiLeaks published his colorful cables to Washington about the eccentricities of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, complicating relations with the notoriously sensitive regime. Ambassador Gene Cretz, a career diplomat named to the post in 2008, is back in Washington for consultations with the State Department. A senior U.S. official, speaking on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, said, ""One of the issues that we are evaluating is his ability to serve our interests as ambassador in light of what's happened."" The cables refer to Gadhafi as ""mercurial and eccentric"" and describe a ""voluptuous"" blonde Ukrainian as his nurse and companion. ""Have the Libyans expressed concerns to us about WikiLeaks? Yes,"" the official said. ""Our relationship with Libya is complex. It was complex before WikiLeaks, and it is complex after WikiLeaks, perhaps more complex."" Publicly, the State Department says there has been no request from Libya to remove Cretz, and P.J. Crowley, State Department spokesman, insisted in his daily briefing that ""he is still our ambassador to Libya."" Crowley, however, added, ""One of the issues we will be discussing with Ambassador Cretz is his return to Libya."" The fallout from WikiLeaks continues to roil U.S. diplomatic relations and, according to the senior official speaking on background, Libya is not the only country to be affected. ""This is not unique to Libya,"" he said. ""If you look globally, the relationship between our ambassadors and a number of governments has been affected by disclosure of these cables. On an ongoing basis we are evaluating whether any changes will have to be made."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however, wants U.S. diplomats to continue providing candid and unvarnished feedback to Washington, the official said. ""We are not going to change who we are or what we do,"" the official said, adding: ""We are concerned about the candor in our ongoing, day-to-day dialogue with governments. Some governments have told us they are going to be less candid in the future and that is something that the secretary has made clear we will just have to work through over time.""","Ambassador Gene Cretz filed colorful cables regarding Moammar Gadhafi .

"There are two Web clips featuring Beyonce that have been getting a lot of attention. Clip No. 1 features a host of celebrities and community leaders, including Bey, involved with a movement trying to ban the use of the word ""bossy"" in reference to young girls. The reason being that ""bossy"" is often used in a derogatory way to describe girls who display leadership traits, thus discouraging them from asserting themselves. ""I'm not bossy, I'm the boss,"" the superstar says. Clip No. 2 features Beyonce wearing a bedazzled thong and not much else, as she sings about ejaculate landing on her dress after performing oral sex in the back of a limo. ""I just want to be the girl you like,"" she pleads to her husband, Jay-Z, in the ""Partition"" video, the second single from her latest release, ""Beyonce."" The first single, ""Drunk in Love"", included a line from her husband that made light of a domestic violence scene documented in the Tina Turner biopic ""What's Love Got To Do With It."" Beyonce the artist is above reproach. With 17 wins, she has only one less Grammy than Aretha Franklin. She has more than 13 million Twitter followers despite only tweeting eight times. And she famously crashed iTunes by releasing a full CD without any promotion. However, Beyonce the role model is questionable as hell. I'm all for handcuffs, hot wax, stripper poles, whips -- whatever it is two consenting adults want to do in the privacy of their bedroom to keep the relationship fresh. But increasingly, Beyonce has chosen not to keep such things private. The lyrics to ""Partition"" pale in comparison with some of the more graphic phrases heard on her latest CD, and many parents complained that having her sexually charged performance open this year's Grammys was inappropriate given the time of night. Beyonce: Gender equality is a myth . I was not one of those parents, mind you. But then again, I have a 17-year-old son, not an 11-year-old daughter. Fox's Bill O'Reilly was mocked recently for his pseudointerview with Russell Simmons, in which instead of talking about Simmons' new book on meditation -- which the hip-hop star came on the show to do -- he ranted about ""Partition."" ""Teenage girls look up to Beyonce, particularly girls of color,"" O'Reilly said. ""Why on Earth would this woman do that?"" And by ""that,"" he means sing about having sex in the back of a limo. ""I believe an entertainer like Beyonce, and a mogul like you, have an obligation to protect children. Not put out exploitative garbage that you know harm impressionable children,"" he said. Now as a fan of many genres of music, I know O'Reilly could replace Bey's name with any number of popular artists and the question would still be applicable. For example, country artists sing about getting drunk and having sex in the back of pickups quite often. And in 2011, the National Center for Health Statistics reported teenage birth rates for 15- to-19-year-olds were highest in states such as Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and Kentucky, where country music is most popular. So O'Reilly singling out the music of Beyonce can certainly be seen as either unfair or even a not-so-subtle attack on the White House, given Beyonce's ties to the administration. But O'Reilly's motives aside, Beyonce does position herself as a role model for young girls. Like the ""Bossy"" video encouraging young girls to be leaders. Or the ""Move Your Body"" video released in conjunction with Michelle Obama's anti-obesity campaign directed at kids. I doubt the first lady would be happy to see Sasha or Malia dancing to ""Partition"" the way Beyonce does in her music video. Not because dancing seductively or expressing sexuality through song is inherently wrong. But doing so at 15 and 12 -- while singing ""I just want to be the girl you like"" -- isn't ideal. Currently, Vevo is heavily promoting the video, and the song jumped from No. 97 to No. 23 on Billboard in one week. Of course the President and first lady are excellent parents who will guide their daughters down the appropriate path. Unfortunately, too many daughters, too many children have TVs for baby sitters. That isn't Beyonce's cross to bear. Nor is it a cross O'Reilly should attempt to leave on her doorstep. But it is a cross any artist who brands herself or himself as a role model for young impressionable minds needs to be aware of. Beyonce makes grown-folks music, and I love it. But if she truly wants to be kid-friendly, she should consider leaving the foreplay in the bedroom because trying to have it both ways makes parenting for some harder than it should be.","Beyonce appears in two popular new videos; one is to encourage girls to be assertive .

"The DEA is launching an investigation into claims that NFL players illegally have been given powerful painkillers, among other prescription drugs, to keep them on the field, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. The federal drug enforcement agency is looking into records pertaining to the distribution of prescription drugs handed out to players by trainers and doctors, the source added. Those records would include documented visits and examinations by doctors, diagnoses and authorized prescriptions written for players. The investigation is described as being in its ""early stages."" The DEA would not respond Monday to inquiries specifically on the NFL. Agency spokeswoman Erin Mulvey in New York told CNN, ""We cannot confirm or deny the existence of any investigation."" Depending on what is found, the case could become a civil and/or criminal case with doctors potentially going to jail if convicted of drug-related offenses. In part, the investigation was prompted by a class-action lawsuit filed in May, 2013 in federal court by nine named retired NFL players representing 1,300 others who claim the NFL ""intentionally, recklessly, and negligently created and maintained a culture of drug misuse, substituting players' health for profit,"" according to court documents. The players' suit accuses NFL trainers of handing out pills without prescriptions and without regard to possible dangerous interactions with other drugs. The named players in the lawsuit include former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon who, according to the lawsuit, says he got hooked on painkillers taking as many as 100 Percocet pills a month. ""Our more than 1300 clients welcome any government investigation which aims to protect them from further harm,"" Steve Silverman, attorney for the plaintiffs suing the NFL, said in a statement to CNN.

"(CNN)Sometimes ordinary people can have an extraordinary impact on American politics. The new movie ""Selma"" recreates the grass-roots protests that resulted in the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In this riveting film, audiences get to see how average citizens have been able to push politicians to take action that they don't have the courage to do on their own. The movie depicts President Lyndon Johnson as a leader who was extraordinarily hesitant, to the point of being hostile, toward proposing a voting rights bill. ""The voting thing is going to have to wait,"" Johnson tells a frustrated Martin Luther King Jr. in one scene. ""It can't wait,"" King responds. The storyline of the movie revolves around a courageous group of civil rights activists who put their lives on the line when Washington wasn't helping them until they convinced the President to send a bill to Congress. After the violent response by police to the marchers, Johnson finally listens to King, who had warned that he will be remembered as ""saying 'wait' and 'I can't.' "" A controversy has opened up about the film, with a number of critics, including former members of the administration, pointing out that the movie offers a skewed portrayal of LBJ. He comes across as a president uninterested in voting rights and primarily focused on secret FBI surveillance of King. The best place to look for some answers is in the historical archives. This is the first in a series of columns this month that I will be writing that explore some of the conversations in the White House telephone recordings of President  Johnson—on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Great Society, the wide range of domestic programs enacted by the 89th Congress in 1965 and 1966—to understand some of the lessons that these conversations offer us in today's political world. By the time of his landslide election victory against Arizona Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964, President Johnson believed that Congress needed to pass a strong voting rights bill that would guarantee the ability of African-Americans to register to vote and actually cast their choice on election day. For much of his life he had been opposed to the racial inequality of the South and the civil rights movement in the 1950s and early 1960s had further strengthened his belief in the necessity of federal legislation. In 1964, Congress, with Johnson's strong support, had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which ended racial segregation in public accommodations. President Johnson didn't need any more grass-roots protests to convince him that voting rights legislation was necessary. This is one big thing the movie gets wrong, which has led some scholars, including the head of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum and former adviser Joseph Califano to rightly complain of how the film depicts him. Indeed, the White House tapes tell a very different story. Only a month after his election victory, President Johnson can be heard telling Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach on December 14, 1964, that he should start crafting a strong piece of legislation that would create a ""simple, effective"" method to register African-Americans to vote. Over the next few months, Johnson instructed Katzenbach to conduct secret negotiations with Republican Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen to design the framework for a bill, which they would reach agreement on by early March. But the movie is correct in asserting that Johnson disagreed with civil rights leaders on the timing; he was not ready to actually propose a bill to Congress.  While Johnson wanted a bill, he didn't feel he could deal with the issue until later in 1965.  Johnson feared that the time was not right. He sensed that he wouldn't be able to find enough support in the House and Senate. Congress had just passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he said, so another heated debate over race relations could tear the Democratic Party (then divided between Southern Democrats and liberal northerners) apart. Civil rights activists were unwilling to wait any longer. They believed that when Congress refused to act on major civil rights issues, always with the justification that the time was not yet right, the chances increased that the bill would never see the light of day. King liked to speak about the ""fierce urgency of now,"" by which he meant that it was intolerable to postpone resolving the fundamental issues of the day. In American politics, delay was often the way major legislation was left to die. Johnson, who for years had seen the kind of trickery Southern conservatives were capable of when it came to civil rights, could not be moved by logic. During a conversation with King on January 15, 1965, the President made it clear to the civil rights leader that he was determined on moving forward on a number of other domestic issues, such as education, Medicare, poverty and more (all of which, Johnson reminded him, would be enormously helpful to African Americans). In Johnson's view, they had to get the bills passed before what he called the ""vicious forces"" concentrated in Congress to block them. King tried to appeal to Johnson's practical side, highlighting how the African-American vote in the South would create a powerful coalition, along with moderate whites, in a ""New South."" Johnson would have none of this. Johnson says to King that he and the civil rights movement needed to help him build support for legislation by talking about the kind of rights violations that were common in the South. But he was not prepared to send anything to Congress. The proposal would have to wait. This is the moment when the civil rights activists stepped in. King had warned Johnson that if Congress did not take up this issue, activists would force them to do so. The civil rights movement mobilized in Selma, Alabama, one of the most notoriously racist cities in the South, to organize protests in favor of voting rights. The violence the activists encountered when they were viciously attacked by Sheriff James Clark, an ardent racist who dressed in military garb and wore a button that said ""Never!"" and his men was shocking. As Johnson watched and read the news, he became convinced he might have to take action sooner than he thought. The protests culminated with the historic march from Selma to Montgomery over the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7. The violence that protesters encountered over the Pettus Bridge, on a day that would be remembered as ""Bloody Sunday,"" shocked legislators and the President into concluding that legislation was needed immediately. As Rep. John Lewis, then Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee leader, whose skull was cracked by the police, recalled, ""They came toward us, beating us with nightsticks, bullwhips, tramping us with horses, releasing the tear gas. I was hit in the head by a state trooper with a nightstick. My legs went from under me. I thought I was going to die. I thought I saw death."" On March 10, after asking if the white preacher James Reeb, who had been attacked by white racists after having participated in another march in favor of voting rights, was dead, Johnson admitted to Katzenbach that he was ""anxious"" the public would see him as a ""Southern president"" who was tacitly supporting racist law officers allied with the forces against the civil rights movement. Johnson took action. He delivered a dramatic address to a joint session of Congress that brought Martin Luther King Jr. to tears. The activists had achieved their goal. Their marches, and the violent response by the white police, had pressured Johnson into taking up this issue before Congress had finished its work on all the other proposals. In the days that followed the protests, Johnson worked hard to move the bill and to contain the forces of white racism. Johnson called Alabama Gov. George Wallace, who was allowing this violence to take place and doing little to establish order, a ""treacherous son of a bitch"" when speaking to former Tennessee Gov. Buford Ellington on March 18. On March 24, 1965, Katzenbach (who had been appointed attorney general in February) felt confident that the civil rights forces were pleased with the administration and the activists were subsiding, though he warned the President that he didn't want to give the impression ""because we get this voting bill quickly . . . we can all turn our attention to something else and forget about civil rights. Because they'll continue to raise some hell."" Katzenbach and Johnson were clearly aware of the impact that the grass-roots would have. The Senate passed the bill on May 26 and the House passed it on July 19, 1965. LBJ signed the bill on August 6. In the current era, when Congress seems so broken, Selma is an important way to remember that, ultimately, real political change is in the hands of citizens. Leaders, even those who can be bold and who actually want to get things done usually tend to hesitate on tackling controversial issues, often paralyzed by the pressures of political necessity and opposition. Without citizen pressure, the status quo usually wins even when there is a president who supports reform. But the status quo didn't win in Selma. Civil rights activists made sure their leaders took action. They gave LBJ the political space he needed to maneuver. The result of their efforts transformed American history. Within only a few months, almost 250,000 new African-American voters were registered to vote with the help of federal protection -- and millions more would follow. ​ .","New film 'Selma' tells story of violent repression of civil rights protests, leading to enactment of Voting Rights Act .

"(CNN) -- A few decades ago, in the very early stages of one of the most volatile presidential campaigns in American history, Mitt Romney's father was seen as the man to beat for the Republican nomination. As it turned out, his candidacy did not even last until the first of the 1968 primaries. He was done in by his unscripted outspokenness - a trait not generally attributed to his more cautious son, whose first run for the White House in 2008 survived through Super Tuesday. And who, until recently, was front-runner in this year's GOP sweepstakes. Ten years after his presidential foray, I interviewed George Romney over a lunch of grilled cheese and chocolate milk at his suburban Detroit home. He squeezed me in between a morning round of golf and his afternoon tennis match. At 70, he was retired from politics but still keeping the whirlwind schedule of a campaigner, preaching citizen activism and the Mormon religion from Michigan to Moscow. Reflecting on his 1968 campaign experience, he said: . ""If I had been elected president, I would have undertaken to do things that would have been so opposed by the special interests that they would have chopped me into little pieces."" Like father, like son -- in business . Like his son years later, George Romney first made his bones in the business world, leading fledgling American Motors Corp. in the 1950s war on the ""gas-guzzling dinosaurs"" offered by Detroit's ""Big Three."" AMC introduced less profitable but more affordable compact cars to a welcoming marketplace. He entered politics in the 1960s, coordinating a classic grass-roots citizen drive to adopt a state constitution in Michigan, became a civil rights activist and was elected governor. In nearly six years in office, he enacted the state's first income tax against the strident opposition of many in his own party and tussled with President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat who saw him as a potential 1968 re-election challenger, over sending federal troops to help end Detroit's bloody 1967 race riot that left 43 dead. He also toured South Vietnam for 31 days in 1965 with a group of his fellow governors at a time that Americans still largely supported U.S. involvement in the Southeast Asian country. It's what he said when asked some two years later why he had changed his position on the war that doomed his presidential aspirations. ""When I came back from Vietnam, I just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody could get,"" he told Detroit TV interviewer Lou Gordon in August 1967. ""Not only by the generals but the diplomatic corps over there. They do a very thorough job."" An early backer of the U.S. efforts ""to reverse a shift in the balance of power"" between Communist North Vietnam and democratic South Vietnam, Romney said the additional research he did on his return convinced him -- well before many of his countrymen -- that it was the wrong war at the wrong time. ""I think it's tragic we got involved in the conflict there,"" he told Gordon. ""...The Vietnam War is a farce, so somebody had to speak up and it turned out to be me."" 'Brainwashing' doomed presidential chances . It was the ""brainwash"" line that caught fire and did him in. As he told me in the interview years later, ""It was a good example of being right too soon on a political issue."" By the time the controversy exploded, Romney already had lost his very early lead in the polls to Richard Nixon. By the time he dropped out, just before the New Hampshire primary, he was hopelessly behind. That was the first in a series of dramatic political developments that year - Johnson jarred the nation by announcing he would not seek re-election, the man whose candidacy he most feared, Robert Kennedy, was assassinated on the night he won the California primary, riots rocked the Democratic convention in Chicago and Nixon was elected president over eventual Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey. Romney later became Nixon's Housing and Urban Development secretary, but left that post because of his inability to get White House support for urban initiatives he wanted to launch, blaming the political climate of the times. ""Nixon was a crook, but he was no dummy,"" Romney told me -- another example of his often stunning candor even in the context of that era. He remained a media darling for years after that. Every time he paid a courtesy call on Michigan's state Capitol in Lansing when I was working as a reporter there in the 1970s, the entire press corps would scramble for a quick headline. He rarely disappointed. ""It was just all so natural for him,"" said Keith Molin, who worked on Romney's campaigns for governor, became an influential state GOP operative and served as state labor director and then commerce director under Romney's successor as governor, William Milliken. ""When George walked into a room, that room was his."" 'He stood up and took responsibility' And when he took a position, no matter how controversial, he stuck with it, Molin said in a recent telephone interview. ""He came out in support of an income tax ... he was one of the leading advocates,"" he said. ""Conservatives went bananas. ""He took on his own party. And the party had to make some adjustments. There were no oaths, no signed statements, no read my lips. He stood up and took responsibility for leading the charge."" Comparing father and son, Molin said: ""I watch Mitt pander to the tea party -- I'm sorry, there's no other way I can describe it. In 1962, at his first (state) convention as leader of the party, George Romney faced the same situation with the John Birch Society, and he took 'em face on. He didn't try to find an accommodation, and went on and beat 'em. ""But that was George Romney. He knew who he was. It was a very different time, but that was George. ""He helped craft a new model of education in the urban area. His son did the same thing with health care. He didn't invent government. He just made it work,"" Molin said. ""Stop apologizing for what you've done."" Bill Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics, an online newsletter, was research director for the state Republican Party while Romney was governor, and later became a state lawmaker, a director of state agencies and U.S. deputy assistant secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. ""The contrast between the personalities of Mitt and George is pretty pronounced,"" he told me. ""Though both fairly forceful, dynamic characters, Mitt, quite frankly, is the plastic man. ""He looks like his father in many respects but the directness and openness of George Romney simply is not there. You get the feeling everything is calculated, beyond his changing positions on the issues. It's like everything he says -- it just doesn't have the veracity, the ring of candor that you got from his father."" 'My dad was the real deal' Asked for reaction to the comments of Molin and Ballenger, a spokeswoman for the Mitt Romney campaign directed me to Bob Danhof, who served as George Romney's legal counsel when he was governor, but he could not be reached. George Romney, whose wife Lenore ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate after his departure from politics, died in 1995. He's still remembered with obvious affection by those who knew him well. ""He was a character,"" Ballenger said. ""He had a reputation before he was even elected governor. He was the guy who talked about gas-guzzling dinosaurs and was on the cover of Time magazine. You talk about somebody who's prescient, and rather prudent - here's a guy who was talking about green energy years before it was any kind of issue."" Both Ballenger and Molin called my attention to a recent Washington Post account of Mitt Romney's encounter in New Hampshire with an 83-year-old Polish immigrant who pulled out her autograph book and showed him the autograph she had gotten from his father. ""My dad was the real deal,"" Mitt Romney told her. Later the woman told reporters she liked Mitt, too. ""I liked his smile. He came through human-like,"" she said. Of the relationship Mitt Romney had with his father, Molin said, ""He worshipped the ground he walked on.""","George Romney was outspoken, a trait not generally attributed to his son, Mitt Romney .

"Nearly three-quarters of Americans questioned in a CNN/ORC poll say they don't think Russia can be trusted to uphold the terms of the ceasefire agreement it recently reached with Ukraine. Seventy-three percent of the 1,014 Americans questioned said Russia can't be trusted to keep the terms of the ceasefire, while 24% said Moscow could be trusted to honor it. Although the two countries agreed to a ceasefire, spotty violence continues. Pro-Russian rebels killed 10 civilians in a rocket attack in eastern Ukraine Wednesday, according to the Ukrainian military. While many Americans are concerned about the situation in Ukraine -- with 72% saying they are either somewhat or very concerned -- they are fewer than the 78% who expressed similar sentiments in May. The declining concern may reflect the calmer situation in Ukraine, and the fact that Americans are becoming more concerned about the terror group ISIS as the United States gets more involved in trying to stop its activities in Iraq and Syria. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is in Washington Thursday, meeting with President Barack Obama and addressing Congress. The Ukraine issue appears to have a bipartisan consensus, with 71% of those who say they're concerned about it identifying themselves as Democrats and 75% of respondents saying they're Republicans.

"Some state legislators in South Carolina want to teach a lesson -- to two of the state's public universities. The legislators want to reduce funding for the College of Charleston and the University of South Carolina Upstate because the schools assigned materials to students that dealt with homosexual themes. The state House of Representatives is preparing to vote this week on a budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year that would strip the College of Charleston of $52,000 and the University of South Carolina Upstate in Spartanburg of $17,162. The cuts are a fraction of the universities' proposed state funding for next year -- College of Charleston is set to receive $20 million and USC Upstate $9.5 million. But the proposed cuts, despite being small portions of the schools' overall budgets, have drawn outrage from students, faculty, and even some alumni from both institutions. Many have taken their complaints to a website created to protest the cuts, and  hundreds of individuals have posted, expressing their disapproval. ""I am a gay USC Upstate faculty member and a proud CofC alumnus...and SC is my home too. I won't stand by and let my academic freedom AND my civil rights be devalued,"" one post read. The situation stems from freshman assignments at both schools. Last summer, the College of Charleston provided incoming freshmen with a memoir, ""Fun Home,"" in which the author deals with coming out as a lesbian. The University of South Carolina Upstate, meanwhile, assigned ""Out Loud: The Best of Rainbow Radio,"" which features an account of South Carolina's first gay and lesbian radio show. Rep. Garry Smith, a Republican from Simpsonville who proposed the cuts in the state House Ways and Means committee, says he heard of the assignments after receiving an e-mail of concern from a constituent whose 17-year-old daughter was bound for the College of Charleston. Smith contacted the college's board of trustees, inquiring if there were options for students ""offended"" by the subject matter. He says the school's administration told him there were no options. ""I think the university has to be reasonable and sensible to the feelings and beliefs of their students. That was totally ignored here. I was trying to hold the university accountable,"" Smith told CNN. ""Their stance is 'Even if you don't want to read it, we'll shove it down your throat.' It's not academic freedom -- it's academic totalitarianism."" The College of Charleston says that all of its more than 2,000 incoming freshmen do receive a copy of ""Fun Home"" as part of the school's ""College Reads!"" program, but that the memoir is not required reading. If a faculty member assigned the book in class and a student was offended, the students could move to another section where the book was not assigned, according to the school. USC Upstate assigned ""Out Loud"" to its more than 1,100 freshman as summer reading for English 101, but noted that students could take the class in their second year if they chose to do so. The president of the College of Charleston, P. George Benson, said in a statement to CNN that a university education must include a forum for students to engage controversial ideas, and that the looming budget cuts would undermine the school's integrity. ""Any legislative attempt to tie institutional funding to what books are taught, or who teaches them, threatens the credibility and reputation of all South Carolina public universities,"" Benson said. Smith, meanwhile, pointed out that the cuts from both universities are the exact costs of those two specific reading programs, and that the dollar amount for the programs, on which the cuts were based, was provided by the universities themselves. So far, there is no indication that momentum to pass the budget, and the cuts, is slowing down. The 2014-2015 state budget has already cleared the Higher Education subcommittee, as well as the House Ways & Means committee, where it passed 20-1. Ways and Means committee member Rep. B.R. Skelton, a Republican and former professor at Clemson University, tried to reverse course by proposing an amendment to restore funds to both universities. It was voted down in the committee 13-10. ""I feel that as a legislative body, it's not our place to introduce social issues and punish or reward someone for what we like or what we don't like,"" Skelton told CNN. ""I have serious problems with censorship. We don't need to go down that slippery slope of taking retribution for content."" The ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter of Orange County, also opposed the budget cuts but she said the amendment to restore funding was voted down because a number of the committee members didn't want to face backlash from conservative voters in South Carolina. ""That vote was not a vote of conviction, but a vote of self-preservation to protect themselves from a primary challenger,"" she said. If the proposed cuts are approved by the full House this week as part of the larger budget, the budget bill will then move to the state Senate. If it passes there, it will go to the desk of Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican. The governor's office did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. Rep. Smith says many people have written and called him supporting the proposed cuts. ""They appreciate me taking a stand,"" he said. ""I anticipate it will be a very active debate (in the full House),"" Smith added. ""We'll see how it comes out.""

"Two American missionary workers infected with the deadly Ebola virus were given an experimental drug that seems to have saved their lives. Dr. Kent Brantly was given the medication, ZMapp, shortly after telling his doctors he thought he would die, according to a source familiar with his case. Within an hour, doctors say his symptoms -- labored breathing and a widespread rash -- dramatically improved. Nancy Writebol, another missionary working with Samaritan's Purse, received two doses of the medication and has also shown significant improvement, sources say. As there is no proven treatment and no vaccine for Ebola, this experimental drug is raising lots of questions. 1. Who makes the drug? The drug was developed by the biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc., which is based in San Diego. The company was founded in 2003 ""to develop novel pharmaceuticals for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, focusing on unmet needs in global health and biodefense,"" according to its website. Mapp Biopharmaceutical has been working with the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an arm of the military responsible for countering weapons of mass destruction, to develop an Ebola treatment for several years. 2. Are there other experimental Ebola drugs out there? Yes. In March, the NIH awarded a five-year, $28 million grant to establish a collaboration between researchers from 15 institutions who were working to fight Ebola. ""A whole menu of antibodies have been identified as potentially therapeutic, and researchers are eager to figure out which combinations are most effective and why,"" a news release about the grant said. Tekmira, a Vancouver-based company that has a $140 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop an Ebola drug, began Phase 1 trials with its drug in January. But the FDA recently halted the trial, asking for more information. At least one potential Ebola vaccine has been tested in healthy human volunteers, according to Thomas Geisbert, a leading researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch. And last week, the NIH announced a safety trial of another Ebola vaccine will start as early as September. 3. How does ZMapp work? Antibodies are proteins used by the immune system to mark and destroy foreign, or harmful, cells. A monoclonal antibody is similar, except it's engineered in a lab so it will attach to specific parts of a dangerous cell, according to the Mayo Clinic, mimicking your immune system's natural response. Monoclonal antibodies are used to treat many different types of conditions. Sources told CNN the medicine given to Brantly and Writebol abroad was a three-mouse monoclonal antibody, meaning that mice were exposed to fragments of the Ebola virus and then the antibodies generated within the mice's blood were harvested to create the medicine. However, the drug can also be produced with proteins made from tobacco plants. ZMapp manufacturer Kentucky BioProcessing in Owensboro has been working with Samaritan's Purse and Emory University Hospital to provide limited quantities of the drug to Emory, according to company spokesman David Howard. 4. Why did American missionary workers get the drug? Many have asked why these two workers received the experimental drug when so many -- around 1,600 -- others in West Africa also have the virus. The World Health Organization says it was not involved in the decision to treat Brantly and Writebol. Both patients had to give consent to receive the drug, knowing it had never been tested in humans before. The process by which the medication was made available to the American patients may have fallen under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's ""compassionate use"" regulation, which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials. 5. Did doctors know it would work? No. The drug had shown promise in primates, but even in those experiments, just eight monkeys received the treatment. In any case, the human immune system can react differently than primates', which is why drugs are required to undergo human clinical trials before being approved by government agencies for widespread use. The two Americans' cases will be studied further to determine how the drug worked with their immune systems. 6. Will the drug be made available to other Ebola patients? It's unclear. Rolling out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would be very difficult, Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. Experimental drugs typically not mass-produced, and tracking the success of such a drug if used would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says scientists have to be careful about assuming this drug will work in other patients as it appears to have worked in Brantly. ""Having worked with administering antibodies for people for a really long time, that would be distinctly unusual,"" he told CNN. ""As we all know in medicine ... you have to withhold judgment."" 7. Does the company have more vials of the drug? The company has very few doses ready for patient use, Fauci told CNN. ""(Kentucky BioProcessing) is working closely with Mapp, various government agencies, and other parties to increase production of ZMapp, but this process will take several months,"" Howard said. 8. Who paid for the drug and how much did it cost? We don't know. Samaritan's Purse covered the cost of Brantly and Writebol's evacuations but did not pay for the drug, according to a spokesman. When a patient gets an experimental drug, the drug company can donate the product under compassionate use. Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. might have done that in this case. Health insurance companies typically do not pick up the tab for treatments that have not been approved by the FDA. But they usually would cover the cost of any doctor fees associated with giving the drug and any costs associated with monitoring how the drug is working. 9. Would this drug stop the Ebola epidemic? If it were widely available, it certainly couldn't hurt. An effective Ebola drug could help doctors treat the deadly virus, which is killing about 60% of the people infected in West Africa. But a vaccine would be a much more effective tool in stopping this, and future, epidemics. Vaccines are given to healthy people to prevent them from ever becoming infected. One challenge with Ebola, experts say, is that companies don't believe they could make much money from developing a vaccine, so few companies show interest.","Ebola drug ZMapp can be produced using tobacco plant proteins .

"""Are you open yet?"" a passerby asked. It was 10 a.m. on a sunny fall day here, where a small group of staffers met a CNN camera crew outside of Smitten Ice Cream. By the time the doors officially opened two hours later, a handful of others had inquired about when they could get a scoop. The people wanted their ice cream. You see, this is not your typical ice cream parlor. ""Here at Smitten we actually make every single batch of ice cream to order,"" explained store founder Robyn Sue Fisher. ""So nothing is frozen until you order it, and we make everything from scratch that morning."" Using seasonal and local ingredients, Fisher's team creates creative flavors like cinnamon apple crisp, maple brown sugar squash and Meyer lemon gingersnap. Smitten doesn't use preservatives, emulsifiers or stabilizers in any of its ingredients. And because its creations are frozen before your eyes in seconds, the process involves some serious science. ""We do get super nerdy about our ice cream and we get nerdy because we think it makes a better product,"" said Fisher. No wonder Vogue called Smitten, ""arguably the freshest, if not the best, ice cream on earth."" After a few years in the corporate world and attending the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Fisher decided to follow a childhood dream. ""My mom used to tell me that I had two stomachs and one of those was solely reserved for ice cream,"" Fisher said. So the little girl with the big appetite invested her life savings, teamed up with some engineers and spent five years prototyping ice cream machines in her backyard. The final product was a high-tech, patented mixer called a Brrr machine. Those who serve the silky smooth ice cream at Smitten are aptly named, Brrristas. Each order takes about 90 seconds to make and many customers took full advantage of that wait by snapping pictures and videos of the Brrr machine in action. Brrristas pour in organic cream along with other ingredients and set the Brrr in motion. It whirrs and spins and the mixing bowls become surrounded by a fog of evaporating liquid nitrogen. ""We use nitrogen because it's super, super cold. It's actually negative 321 degrees Fahrenheit,"" explained Fisher, ""And a super, super cold freezing process actually has the ability to make a smaller ice crystal, and a smaller ice crystal means a really, really smooth product."" One of three different patents for the Brr machine is a double-helical beater that's designed to scrape every surface of itself and every surface of the bowl to develop the tiny ice crystals. It also has ""smart"" software that's programmed to know when the ice cream is ready to be served. ""A smaller ice crystal makes a smoother, more luscious texture,"" said Fisher, ""so our ice cream is actually a lot creamier than other ice cream in addition to being a lot more fresh."" But before the brick-and-mortar store and the frenzy of foodie fans, Fisher had to hit the streets to dish out her treats. She rigged up a Radio Flyer wagon with a battery pack to power the Brrr and tweeted her location for the day. ""I was totally broke and that's why the only thing I could do was sell ice cream out of a Radio Flyer wagon -- which was a super amazing way to learn about what people wanted,"" said Fisher. ""I tested a bunch of different flavors and I already had teamed up with our amazing chef, Robyn Lenzi, and so she made a different flavor every day. I'd pick it out at her house and go into the street."" The combination of fresh ingredients, the magic of the mixer, and word-of-mouth proved to be a winning combination. ""This past summer we served over 20,000 people a month out of this tiny little 320-square-foot shop, so that's a pretty good number for us,"" Fisher said. Smitten plans to open up three new locations in the San Francisco area within the next year. ""We're keeping it local, but we're going to be spreading the Smitten love,"" Fisher said.","A high-tech mixer, called a Brrr machine, can make ice cream from scratch in 90 seconds .

"On Tuesday, three U.S.-trained scientists won the Nobel prize in physics, for finding definitive evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Their discovery did not fit any existing theory, so it had mind-blowing implications for our understanding of the physical world. At the same time, it's relatively easy to explain to nonspecialists. So fasten your seat belts for a quick tour of this frontier of knowledge: What was the actual discovery, why is it important, and what does it mean for our world? Flash back to the 1990s, when two independent research teams set out to ""weigh"" the Universe -- one led by Saul Perlmutter, a young physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the other by  a Harvard professor of astronomy, Bob Kirshner, with former graduate student Brian Schmidt, now at the Australia National University, and then-graduate student Adam Riess, now a senior astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Johns Hopkins University. These astrophysicists knew the universe was a vast, mostly empty space, dotted with galaxies of stars in a thin sea of atoms. Thanks to work 70 years earlier by Edwin Hubble (after whom NASA's space telescope is named), they also knew the universe has been expanding for billions of years. Like all astronomers, they expected the expansion to be slowing due to the pull of gravity between galaxies and other matter. It's pretty simple: The more stuff in the universe, the greater the gravitational ""braking"" of the expansion. So, the Nobel prize-winning experiments were designed to measure the rate of deceleration of the expansion, and thus the total amount of material in the universe. What could go wrong? After all, gravity was the only known force that could play a role. Both teams measured the distances to supernovae in distant galaxies, expecting they would be closer to us than if there were no gravity at all. Imagine the shock when the data indicated the expansion was speeding up. Supernovae appeared to be more distant -- fainter -- than if the expansion speed were unchanging.  What?! The accelerating rate of expansion signaled that gravity, a force we have known about and loved since the first apple fell from a tree, is a paltry thing compared to some new, utterly unknown, energy field that pushes galaxies apart. We call this new thing ""dark energy"" -- signifying the energy that appears to push outward, with the adjective ""dark"" signifying that we know nothing whatsoever about its nature. Moreover, in 2003, NASA's WMAP cosmology satellite showed convincingly that dark energy is the dominant constituent of the universe. This stuff wasn't predicted by any physics theory and was completely unknown until the Nobel prize-winning teams of astronomers and physicists made their measurements -- yet there is more of it than anything else in the universe. More than the atoms that make up you and me and our Earth, more than the hydrogen and helium that pervades the universe, more than the unknown dark matter particles that cause attractive gravity and allow galaxies to form in the first place. Whatever it is, it's teaching us something utterly new about how matter and space and time behave. A fundamentally new physics theory is needed. The fact is, dark energy is the biggest mystery in science. It has driven a huge amount of research in the past decade, and was a key driver in last year's ""New Worlds, New Horizons"" report from the National Academies of Science, which prioritized future astronomy and astrophysics projects. Making better measurements of the properties of dark energy was very high on the list, using the James Webb Space Telescope, now nearing completion, as well as an infrared-optical space telescope to be built in the coming decade. Both teams measured the expansion rate using supernovae, which are stupendous explosions at the end of a star's fuel-burning life. Astronomers know that a certain type of supernova always emits roughly the same amount of light, meaning it is a ""standard candle"" that can be used to indicate distance. Fainter supernovae would be farther away, and brighter ones would be closer. To make their measurements of supernovae, the teams used telescopes around the world and in space, most run by the National Science Foundation and NASA. A supernova's spectrum (how light is distributed across the blue-green-yellow-red optical spectrum) reveals the speed with which it is receding from us due to the expansion of the universe. You've probably noticed how the tone of a siren changes as it moves toward or away from you, and that the change is larger the faster the vehicle moves. Light emitted from supernovae shows the same kind of frequency shift, so its speed can be measured very accurately. One more ingredient was essential for the experiment: the ability to look back in time. It takes a very long time for light to travel to us from these supernovae, which are rare occurrences in distant galaxies. Light from a nearby supernova might take hundreds of thousands of years to reach us, while light from the distant ones sought by the Perlmutter and Schmidt-Riess-Kirshner teams travels for billions of years. This means that looking at supernovae or galaxies at different distances maps the expansion history of the universe -- that is, the rate at which it was expanding at different times in the past. Measuring the change in expansion speed -- the deceleration -- was the experimenters' goal. Instead the Perlmutter and Schmidt-Riess-Kirshner teams found the expansion was accelerating -- as unexpected as seeing a ball fall upward when you drop it. New data were critical to the bizarre new picture. Adam Riess, using the Hubble Space Telescope to measure extremely distant supernovae, showed that earlier in the universe gravity was actually winning over dark energy -- that is, the initial big bang expansion of space was slowing down. Later, as galaxies moved farther apart, the attractive force of gravity between them weakened, and dark energy, which seems to be a constant property of space itself, took over. In today's universe, 13.7 billion years after the big bang, gravity is far weaker than dark energy. So Riess' discovery clinched it: Alternative explanations for the original discovery would not have shown this evolution from gravity-dominated to dark energy-dominated space. Astrophysicists are hot on the trail of dark energy. A fellow physics professor asked me, following Yale's Leigh Page Prize lecture on dark energy by Saul Perlmutter, one of the Nobelists, ""Doesn't this just keep you up at night, wondering what this stuff could be?"" It's keeping a lot of us up at night. What does this discovery mean for the rest of the world, for people not engaged in figuring out the laws of nature? Dark energy does not directly impact our lives, at least not now. Our galaxy has billions of years to go before dark energy could be strong enough to rip it apart.  Events move slowly on universe-al time. But if history is any guide, understanding the physics of particles, space and time has proved incredibly valuable time and time again. Much of the technological innovation that drives our economy today is derived from physics discoveries decades ago, according to the 2006 ""Gathering Storm"" report from the National Academies of Science. The development of the quantum mechanics theory of matter in the 1920s led to the electronics in today's computers, industrial and household electronics, from your iPod to your toaster. Diagnostic imaging used to discover cancers or other disorders has its roots in the scattering of light and particles by matter, as studied by physicists using particle accelerators. Astronomers led the development of electronic imaging devices which are now used widely in digital cameras. Airport X-ray scanners were built by a company run by astronomers interested in detecting X-rays from stars and galaxies. The list goes on and on. When Brian Schmidt became an expert on supernovae, he was thinking about how stars explode, not a Nobel prize. When Adam Riess started graduate school, he was thinking about how the cosmos evolved to the present day. When Saul Perlmutter persuaded his laboratory to do his supernova experiment, he wanted to weigh the universe. When Bob Kirshner attracts hundreds of students to his astronomy classes at Harvard, he teaches them about distant objects and events that seem impossibly remote from our daily lives. But their passion for science led to a Nobel prize-worthy discovery. It reminds us that the United States remains one of the leaders in cutting-edge scientific research and the training of future scientists. This discovery has challenged our very best theorists and attracted clever young people to science. And some day far in the future, understanding how dark energy could be a property of empty space throughout the universe may well have a profound impact on how we live back here on Earth.","Three U.S.-trained scientists won the Nobel prize in physics last week .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- For most of his 82 years, Luis Posada Carriles has endeavored with a single-minded determination to bring down the Cuban Revolution. An anti-Castro Cuban exile and former CIA operative, Posada is accused by the Cuban government of blowing up a commercial airliner, masterminding a bombing campaign of Havana tourist attractions and attempting to assassinate Fidel Castro. While denying that he was behind those attacks, Posada, in his rare public comments, called himself ""a soldier"" not opposed to using violence to force change in Cuba. Before falling ill and stepping down as president, Fidel Castro referred to Posada as the ""most dangerous terrorist in the Western hemisphere"" and called for him to be bought to justice for alleged attacks that date back over 30 years. On Monday, Posada will face trial -- but not on those charges and not in Cuba. He will be tried in the United States for lying to immigration officials. The ""case reads like one of Robert Ludlum's espionage thrillers, with all the plot twists and turns Ludlum is famous for,"" one of the judges who has heard the case over the last five years wrote in the court records. Posada faces 11 counts of lying to officials about how he entered the United States in 2005 and his alleged involvement in attacks on Cuba. He faces five to eight years in prison if convicted. For Margarita Morales, Posada's trial provides little comfort. Morales' father Luis Alfredo Morales Viego was killed in the 1976 bombing of a Cubana Airlines flight. ""It's painful to know that Posada Carriles is only being tried for lying to immigration officials,"" Morales said, tears in her eyes. ""How long do I have to put up with him being called a liar when he's a killer, a terrorist?"" The bomb exploded shortly after Cubana Flight 455 took off from Barbados, killing all 73 passengers and crew aboard. Morales, a trainer for Cuba's national fencing team, was one of 24 team members to die in the crash. Following the crash, Posada was arrested and tried in Venezuela where he had worked for the country's intelligence services. While awaiting trial for the airplane bombing, he escaped from jail. Posada denied involvement in the attack. But a declassified CIA document obtained by the National Security Archive at George Washington University quoted Posada as saying, ""we are going to hit a Cuban airplane."" Venezuela, whose president Hugo Chavez is a staunch ally of Cuba, continues to seek Posada's exradition for the airliner bombing case. So far, U.S. courts have declined to extradite Posada citing his fear of being tortured in Venezuela. ""If Posada Carriles were instead named 'Mohammed,' he would have been extradited a long time ago,"" said Jose Pertierra, the attorney handling Venezuela's extradition request. ""There's a lot of skeletons in those closets and I am sure there's folks in Washington who don't want to see Posada Carriles get extradited because he might sing like a canary."" While Posada is not being tried for being a terrorist, he does face charges for allegedly lying about terrorism. In 2005, Posada was arrested by Homeland Security agents after giving a press conference in Miami where he denied involvement in the airline bombing or targeting civilians in his war against the Cuban government. Initially, he was charged with entering the United States illegally but then federal prosecutors also indicted Posada for lying to immigration officials about his alleged involvement in a series of bombings in Havana in 1997. In 1998, Posada admitted to The New York Times that he had dispatched a group of operatives to Cuba to set off bombs in hotels and restaurants in the hopes of ruining the island's tourism industry. An Italian businessman Fabio Di Celmo was killed in one of the bombings. ''It is sad that someone is dead, but we can't stop,'' Posada told the newspaper. ''That Italian was sitting in the wrong place at the wrong time."" Asked if he felt remorse, Posada told the paper, ''I sleep like a baby.'' Several of those operatives were captured in Cuba and implicated Posada during their trials, according to Cuban government media reports and video shown on the island of the men's testimony. In court filings, Posada's attorneys argue that his English was too poor to understand the reporter's questions. The interviews were recorded though and are expected to be a central part of the government's case against Posada. Fabio Di Celmo's father, Giustino, has lived in Cuba since the 1997 bombing that took his son's life. He was in his room at the Copacabana Hotel when the C-4 plastic explosives went off in the lobby where his son was. ""I never thought that a bomb had gone off,"" Di Celmo said in an interview. ""Fifteen minutes later, I was told Fabio had been killed."" A piece of shrapnel from the bomb had gone through his son's neck. ""If the bomb went off 15 or 20 minutes later when the (hotel) restaurant was open, it would have been a bloodbath,"" Di Celmo said. ""How do you fight ideas by murdering people?""","Cuba accuses Posada of blowing up a commercial airliner and other terror acts .

"More people have been infected with measles in the United States during the first four months of this year than have been infected in the first four months of the past 18 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data released Thursday reveal a dramatic rise in measles outbreaks.  Health officials say 13 outbreaks and 129 cases have been recorded this year, according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. California is reporting the highest numbers, with 58 cases from January 1 to April 14. That's the most cases of measles in the state since 1995. In the past 13 years, the average number of measles cases was nine per year. The CDC says many of the California cases are a result of people visiting the Philippines, which is experiencing a very large measles outbreak; at least 20,000 confirmed and suspected cases have been reported in the Asian nation. Visitors may pick up the disease and bring it back to the U.S., potentially infecting those who cannot be vaccinated against the measles because they are too young, for example, or who have intentionally remained unvaccinated. Another problem that may be contributing to the increase in cases is a lack of awareness among doctors. ""Because of the success of the measles vaccine, many clinicians have never seen measles and may not be able to recognize its features,"" Dr. Julia Sammons writes in a commentary published Thursday in Annals of Internal Medicine. Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. Symptoms usually include fever, cough and conjunctivitis, along with a rash. In rare cases, measles can lead to pneumonia and brain infections, which can be fatal. The last time there was a reported death from measles in the U.S. was in 2005, says Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Schuchat credits the CDC's Vaccines for Children program with contributing to high immunization rates and the dramatic decrease of measles in the U.S. In the U.S., half of all  children under 19 are eligible for the program, which provides vaccines to children whose parents or caregivers can't afford them. According to the CDC,  vaccinations have proved to be very successful in the U.S., preventing an estimated 323 million illnesses and 732,000 deaths. Schuchat says it's impossible to predict what the coming months will bring, but she thinks more people could die from measles. ""Unfortunately, it's probably just a matter a time."" The CDC recommends that children get two doses of the measles vaccine beginning at 12 months, with the second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years old. Infants 6 to 11 months old should get the vaccine before international travel. Schuchat says it's absolutely crucial for measles vaccinations to be up to date. To further reduce the spread of measles, the CDC also recommends that all U.S. residents born after 1956 ensure that they are still immune to measles or receive a new MMR vaccination, particularly if they expect to travel outside North or South America.","13 outbreaks and 129 cases have been recorded this year .

"(CNN)The Republicans have taken control of Congress, and with it ownership of health care reform.  As long as the Republicans were in opposition, they could just complain. And they did, voting repeatedly — and futily — to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Now, they are coming up with actual reform ideas. Their first reform proposal — to redefine full-time employment as 40 hours a week under the ACA — may be emblematic of what is to come. The idea is favored by business groups that support the GOP financially.  But such a change would increase the number of uninsured and raise the federal budget deficit by $53 billion over the next 10 years. Currently, full-time employment is defined as 30 hours per week, and under the health care law, large companies must offer health insurance to those working full time. Most American workers now work close to 40 hours a week and are insured. But under the Republican proposal, employers could send employees home a half-hour early on Friday and drop their coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this change could  ""lead employers to make changes that would affect many more workers than will be affected under current law"" as well as cause a million American workers to lose their employer-sponsored health insurance. Nearly five years after its enactment, the ACA remains unpopular, despite the fact that many of its reforms — ending pre-existing condition exclusions, covering adult children to age 26, and closing the Medicare drug doughnut hole — are very popular. The ACA has also been remarkably successful in achieving its goals.  Both the percentage of Americans who are uninsured and the rate of growth in health care spending are at historic lows.  Republicans continue to talk repeal, but actual repeal would at this point be disruptive. One of the great virtues of the ACA is that it has managed to extend coverage significantly without disrupting the three primary forms of coverage enjoyed by most Americans.  Nearly half of Americans are insured through their employment, while Medicare and Medicaid each cover another sixth. The ACA has expanded benefits for employed Americans by requiring coverage for preventive services and capping out-of-pocket expenditures. Employer-sponsored enrollment has remained largely stable under the ACA, while Medicare and Medicaid enrollment have grown.  Premiums for employer coverage and for Medicare have increased more slowly than in previous years. Republican reform proposals, on the other hand, take aim squarely at the most widespread forms of coverage.  Conservatives have long called for an end to the tax exclusions that have helped to make employer coverage nearly universal in the United States.  They would not eliminate them entirely, rather replacing provisions that currently exempt employer-sponsored coverage from income and payroll taxes with capped deductions and exclusions.  For many employees this will result immediately in higher taxes or premiums.  Moreover, Congress is unlikely to adjust the fixed dollar subsidies to keep pace with health care inflation, so excess cost increases will simply be shifted — dollar for dollar — to employees. Republicans also have long proposed shifting Medicare to a premium support program.  Seniors and the disabled would no longer be able to count on a guaranteed benefit, but would be given a fixed government contribution and have to shop for their own coverage.  Republicans propose turning Medicaid into a block grant program, shifting to the states responsibility for bearing the increasing costs of the program. One of the most problematic features of ACA coverage is the high deductibles and co-insurance that come with many marketplace plans for those whose incomes are too high to qualify them for cost-sharing reduction payments. But conservatives have supported high cost-sharing, and Republican proposals to repeal the ACA would wipe out the out-of-pocket expenditure caps it imposes.  Republicans support generous tax subsidies for health savings accounts to help cover cost sharing, but HSAs only benefit those wealthy enough to put savings aside, and particularly those in high tax brackets. Of course, any legislation that would undermine health coverage for Americans will have to survive a filibuster in the Senate and a veto from President Obama.  Republicans believe they now have a trump card: King v. Burwell, the case the Supreme Court will decide this summer.  Plaintiffs in King ask the court to read a few words of the ACA out of context to deprive millions of Americans of the help they are now receiving through the federal marketplaces. Congress could easily clarify the meaning of these words through the kind of technical amendments that Congresses have always adopted after major legislation.  ACA opponents, however, are encouraging Congress to use a potential adverse Supreme Court decision to push through much broader changes. Notice that Republicans are not promising if you like the coverage you have now you can keep it, whether you are covered by employer-sponsored coverage, Medicare or Medicaid.","Now that GOP has control of Congress, they are proposing reforms to health law .
Their plan to redefine full-time employment as 40 hours a week would hurt Americans ."
"On January 14, 2013, George H.W. Bush was released from a Houston hospital after seven weeks of treatment for bronchitis, an infection and a persistent cough. On Thursday he was sky-diving to celebrate his 90th birthday. A year and a half ago, Bush was already suffering from a form of Parkinson's disease, and some people weren't sure how much he would be able to bounce back after his lengthy  hospitalization. But not only has he been able to travel -- and now sky-dive -- he has also seen a political resurgence. Bushes thank Clinton, Obama for well wishes . In April of last year, he attended the opening of his son's presidential library, telling the audience, ""It's a great pleasure to be here to honor our oldest son."" In July, he visited the White House, where President Barack Obama recognized him for his commitment to volunteerism through his ""Points of Light"" initiative. ""We are surely a kinder and gentler nation because of you,"" Obama told Bush. Democrat Nunn features Bush 41 in first ad . Just in the past month, he received several prestigious honors recognizing his decades of public service and his presidency. The proud Yale '48 graduate received an honorary degree from archrival Harvard, even attending the ceremony, and he also was given a Profile in Courage award by the JFK Library for the 1990 budget deal, which included the politically toxic tax hikes. He admitted at the time that cutting the deal would probably cost him politically, and it did. He lost his re-election bid in 1992. He and his presidency are now seen in a much better light than they were then. Bush's earthbound celebration will be a dinner with 200 friends and family and a performance by Irish tenor Ronan Tynan. His jump was a tandem one from a helicopter with Mike Elliott and members of the All Veteran Group, former members of the U. S. Army Golden Knights parachute team. Bush also celebrated his 75th, 80th and 85th birthdays with jumps. A just-released CNN/ORC International poll shows 58% of Americans now have a favorable opinion of Bush, compared with 47% in 1992. His poll numbers jumped to near 70% during the early days of his son George W. Bush's presidency. His approval rating is second only to Bill Clinton's 66% rate among living presidents. The 41st president marked the 25th anniversary of his inauguration this year. He and his wife, Barbara, attended a celebration event in April featuring hundreds of former administration officials, family and friends, who gathered at his presidential library in College Station, Texas. The Bushes attended some of the seminars examining his presidency and its effects and talked to many of the attendees. ""They just relished it,"" former Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a friend since the 1960s, said of the Bushes' reaction to the event. Bush was especially touched, Simpson said, by the attendance of Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa at the event that spotlighted their work together pushing the Americans with Disabilities Act, which Bush signed into law. ""History is sorting"" through Bush's presidency now, and he is receiving more credit than while he was in office, Simpson said. ""Wait a minute -- the (Berlin) Wall came down ... this guy did things,"" he said. ""25 years ago this hour, the people placed their hopes and trust in our team. Still hard to believe I had the honor to serve as President,"" the former president posted on his Twitter account in January on the actual anniversary of his inauguration. Ron Kaufman, a longtime friend and former Bush White House official, said, ""History is going to be very, very kind to 41 for many reasons. ... Clearly there's a resurgence of people looking at 41, his lifetime and his presidency and after his presidency. ... Respect grows for him and for his family."" The former president, who had mostly stayed away from politics in recent years, now finds himself a big financial draw for Republicans thanks to his fascination with colorful socks. As of last week, the Republican National Committee said it had raised around $1 million selling pairs of striped yellow, orange, green and blue socks it created under Bush's name. As for Bush's birthday and the attention it will bring, Simpson said, ""I think he will say. 'I don't deserve this.' (But) the fact is, you (celebrate) the big 7-0, big 8-0, big 9-0 -- he'd be tickled to death."" Kaufman said Bush doesn't want people ""puffing him up"" and will leave it to history to judge his legacy. ""He really enjoys life to the fullest,"" he said. Kaufman added that after Bush's illness, he is ""less worried about death ... more enjoying his life as it is."" That includes shaving his head to show solidarity with the son of a member of his Secret Service detail who has cancer, and traveling to Duke University to honor Coach Mike Krzyzewski for his work supporting cancer research. As for how the nation views him today, Simpson said Bush ""is quite touched"" by an outpouring of love and affection he receives from people across the nation. ""Wherever he goes, people love him,"" Kaufman said. Opinion: What Bush at 90 can teach millennials . Neil Bush: What 41 wants for his birthday . 41 things about Bush 41 .","George H.W.

"Just $50,000. That was the humble fundraising goal Ryan Grepper set on July 8, lowering his expectations for the second Kickstarter campaign for his Coolest Cooler creation, a high-tech cooler jam-packed with all sorts of fun gizmos -- from a built-in ice crushing blender to Bluetooth speakers and a USB charger. See, the first time Grepper took to the crowdfunding site -- back in November 2013 -- his goal was far more ambitious: $125,000. Yet, after an encouraging strong start, interest in the campaign began wavering. By closing, the project managed to raise a little over $100,000 in pledges and eventually failed to hit its mark. The failure dealt a blow to Grepper's confidence -- but the entrepreneur, who describes himself as ""part visionary, part mad scientist"" refused to give up. Taking the lessons he'd learned from the failed campaign, Grepper re-grouped and last month re-introduced an advanced version of his creation. The result? Just over a month later: more than $8.2 million in pledges and some 41,000 backers. With 21 days still to go, Grepper's project has become the third most-funded campaign on Kickstarter ever -- and could very well hit the top spot if pledges continue to pile in. So, what was the secret behind Grepper's astonishing comeback? And what are the best tips that could help turn your business idea into a crowdfunding mega-success? To find out, CNN's Future Finance spoke to Grepper himself and Julie Wood from Kickstarter, as well as crowdfunding experts Piers Duruz and Salvador Briggman about their top tips for being a Kickstarter success. Ryan Grepper, Coolest Cooler creator . Make sure the design is visually compelling. My first Kickstarter campaign failed and I believe one of the biggest reasons was that I had not advanced the design far enough to capture the Kickstarter audience. Kickstarter is a very visual platform. When I took my design further along in the process I was better able to share my love of the Coolest and more people naturally connected. Consider the time of year when customers will be most receptive. I originally launched the Coolest in November. At the time I was thinking we might hit the Christmas shopping and tailgating audience, but what quickly became apparent was that folks were not focused on coolers in November. Relaunching in July was perfect because people are thinking about coolers during the summer and it was much easier to get exposure. This sounds obvious now, but I believe in learning from my mistakes. Develop a following before the campaign. Although my first campaign failed, I saw that some people were very interested in the Coolest. We nurtured that interest in between our first and second campaign and worked hard to grow that excitement. By the time we launched our second campaign we had a terrific core of interested backers. Now I can't believe how our group of backers has grown. Julie Wood, Kickstarter spokesperson . Make a video! Projects with videos have a higher success rate than those without. Your video doesn't have to be super pro looking. Some of our favorite project videos have a very DIY feel. Offer great rewards!  Some rewards are straightforward, like a copy of the album you made. Other rewards are more creative and unique. The best projects tend to have a mix of both -- it's important to have great rewards at at all pledge levels. The most popular pledge amount on Kickstarter is $25, and the site-wide average for all pledges is about $70. Updates are a great way to build a relationship with your backer community. While your project is live, keep your backers informed about new developments and funding milestones. It'll inspire them to help you spread the word. Treat your project like a story that's unfolding before their eyes. Detailed updates like ""Pics from last night's show!"" or ""We found a printer for our book!"" are fun for everybody to follow along with. Piers Duruz, founder of Crowdfunding Dojo . Start building an email and social media audience immediately, with the promise of content that interests them for following you. Growing an audience takes time, but you can do it while you plan everything else. Even your journey to prepare can be interesting to the right people. The first 48 hours of your campaign is the most critical. If you can get your followers to visit and pledge at any time, make it right at the start. Read this: How to start your own currency . Start your promotion with the people who are closest to you and work your way out. Each group provides social proof to the next group, by showing other people have already backed you when they arrive. Salvador Briggman, founder of CrowdCrux . Don't re-invent the wheel. Study the creators that have come before you. How did they structure their Kickstarter page? What rewards did they offer? How many updates did they do throughout the campaign? In addition, by backing several popular projects in your category, you can see how other creators do backer communication and how long it takes them to fulfil their promises. Also, by browsing their list of backers, you can get an idea of whether the supporters are part of the Kickstarter community (backed multiple projects) or are first-time supporters, meaning the project drove a lot of its own traffic. Focus on emotion, but back it up with technical ability. It's no secret that part of what makes crowdfunding campaigns spread quickly and gather a supporter base is social media. Whether it's networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest ,or social bookmarking websites like Reddit, StumbleUpon, Digg, Blogs, and Tumblr, information can disseminate in a matter of hours and light up the web 2.0 news networks. What many people overlook is the reason why information spreads: it spreads when it makes a reader feel a certain way, which then makes them want to share that link. The feeling that prompts a backer to share that link could be ""This is so cool!"" or ""This is an important cause."" It's easiest to invoke a feeling when you have a prior relationship with your backers, as is the case with the multi-million dollar ""Reading Rainbow"" campaign. Although ultimately, you want your backers to come away from your video and campaign feeling something, you must also back up your pitch with technical ability. What prototype have you created? Why can your team deliver on their promises? You must engage both the left and right hemisphere of the brain when crowdfunding. Everything is sales. Typically, when we think of a salesman, we think of a slimy quick-talking city slicker with too-white teeth and a $2,000 suit. These types of individuals are an instant turnoff. The best types of salesmen don't make you feel like you are being ""sold to."" They have the ability to create the urge to buy. Usually this is the result of giving people what they want, or connecting problems people experience with an appropriate solution. Since you are going to be doing a lot of self-promoting, it's important that you adopt the mental mindset of your potential backers. What types of rewards would get them excited? How would they want to be pitched? What would turn them off? Read this: How to start your own currency . Read this: Would you bank with Starbucks?","Want to launch a successful Kickstarter campaign?

"Partisan hyperbole has ratcheted up as the Obama administration grapples with thousands of young undocumented immigrants surging the U.S.-Mexico border and facing angry protesters on the way to overcrowded detention centers. Republicans blame President Barack Obama for exacerbating the problem. They say the policy of  temporarily deferring deportations of children sent a signal to thousands of kids fleeing poverty and violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador that they could stay in America. Immigrant children tread treacherous political landscape . And even one Democrat, Rep. Henry Cuellar, whose Texas district borders where immigrant children cross the Rio Grande Valley, feels Obama has been ""one step behind."" Obama and many Democrats say House Republicans are to blame for rejecting Senate-passed immigration reform last year without coming up with their own plan. And in the latest development on Monday, the White House said most children involved probably won't be allowed to stay in the country. Beyond the bickering, both sides have valid points, immigration policy and law experts say. Here's a reality check. 1. Why is this happening? Unaccompanied minors have been trekking to the United States in steadily increasing numbers since 2012, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Over roughly the past year or so, however, both the numbers and home countries shifted dramatically. Where previously Mexican children made up the bulk of them, a surge more recently from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador has been seen. ""In reality, there is no single cause. Instead, a confluence of different pull and push factors has contributed to the upsurge,"" the institute's analysis found. ""Recent U.S. policies toward unaccompanied children, faltering economies and rising crime and gang activity in Central American countries, the desire for family reunification, and changing operations of smuggling networks have all converged."" An administration program that defers the deportation of children brought in illegally by their parents or guardians has also had unintended consequences, immigration policy and law experts say. Although most children pouring over the border now would not qualify for ""amnesty,"" drug smugglers have used misperceptions about the program to entice kids with the promise of ""permisos,"" or a pass to stay in America, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a congressional committee recently. Inaction by the House on immigration reform has also exacerbated the problem, experts say. Such reforms would help stabilize employment prospects for immigrants who left their kids behind. As a result, those children might not feel as compelled to flee, experts say. 2. Should government have seen it coming?: Yes. Last year, federal agencies noticed an uptick in minors crossing the border — particularly in the Rio Grande Valley, according to a report from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. The same agencies have also realized those ""children present unique operational challenges"" for Border Patrol and Health and Human Services. The administration was also aware that it couldn't simply deport them. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which was signed into law and reauthorized several times during President George W. Bush's administration set guidelines on how to best handle unaccompanied immigrant children. In 2008, the Department of Health and Human Services was authorized to take over the care of kids, which includes helping meet their health and legal needs, no later than 72 hours after being picked up by the Border Patrol. At a House Homeland Security Committee hearing last month, federal officials said they were having difficulties meeting the 72-hour hand off. The administration has asked Congress to give the Border Patrol more leeway in deportation decisions but doing so is murky, immigration advocates say, since it involves a young and vulnerable population. 3. What's being done now? Obama is vowing to act on his own and use his executive authority to sidestep the House, changes some proponents say could help address the problem. Should Obama use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform? Obama has discussed Mexico's role with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Vice President Joe Biden brainstormed strategies with Central American leaders in Guatemala. Johnson also will travel to Guatemala this summer and he made a public service announcement in Spanish and English last month aimed at Central American parents. He stressed sending children to smugglers who sneak them across the border is dangerous and illegal. Immigration officials also released graphic ads over the weekend with the same message. There is also an effort against drug cartel smuggling rings, and consideration of deploying more Border Patrol agents. White House to spend millions to curb undocumented children crossing border . Obama will request more than $2 billion from Congress to help deal with the problem. Though now, the administration plans to spend roughly $100 million in aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help the immigrant children get back home and stay there. It also setting aside $161.5 million this year for programs designed to help Central American countries respond to ""pressing security and governance challenges."" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday the ""law will be enforced."" This means children who have been apprehended ""will go through the immigration court process"" and it's unlikely that most who do so ""will qualify"" to stay in the country. 4. Would an immigration bill have prevented this? Perhaps, immigration law and policy experts say. Obama likes to blame the House for not passing a Senate immigration bill that also included a path to citizenship for an estimated 8 million of the more than 11 million undocumented workers in the country. Those reforms would have helped immigrant families become more economically stable. Those parents, in turn, would have more money to send back home which, as a result, would help eliminate the type of poverty affected kids experience. 5. Will Obama go to the border? He is in Texas for fundraisers and for an economy event this week. However, White House officials say he has no plans to visit the border now. The White House feels that things are in hand. ""The President is very aware of the situation that exists on the southwest border,"" Earnest said, noting that other officials have traveled there and what they've seen ""is troubling."" Texas Gov. Rick Perry has loudly called for Obama to visit the border.","Partisanship flares as frustrations mount over surge of undocumented immigrant kids .

"It's like finding a needle in a universe-wide haystack. Researchers have located a planet roughly the size of Earth that could be habitable. Designated Kepler-186f, the planet is 490 light-years away.  But in the search for worlds similar to ours, nothing has come closer. ""This is the first definitive Earth-sized planet found in the habitable zone around another star,"" said Elisa Quintana of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute at NASA.  ""Finding such planets is a primary goal of the Kepler space telescope."" ""This discovery not only proves the existence of worlds that might be similar to our own but will undoubtedly shape future investigations of exoplanets that could have terrestrial surface environments,"" the institute said in an announcement Thursday. After spotting it, the institute wasted no time searching for emissions that could indicate the presence of ETs.  So far, no emissions have been found. The size -- estimated to be 10% larger than Earth -- and distance from its star don't just make for interesting factoids.  They give scientists hope that Kepler-186f might sustain life as we know it. Of nearly 1,800 ""confirmed exoplanets"" that have been found, approximately 20 orbit their host stars within habitable zones, where it's believed surface water would not freeze or boil. In 2011, NASA announced that Kepler had observed five planets approximately the size of Earth and in the habitable zone. But the ""previously discovered worlds are larger than Earth, and consequently their true nature -- rocky or gaseous -- is unknown,"" the SETI Institute said in a written announcement on Thursday.  ""On the basis of the observed dimming of starlight from Kepler-186, the authors estimate that this newly discovered planet is roughly the same size as the Earth."" Theoretical models and observations tell scientists that planets the size of Kepler-186f likely have a composition of iron, rock and ice, like Earth, Quintana told reporters Thursday. Even if Kepler-186f is rocky, it's not necessarily habitable, scientists warned Thursday. First, a lot would depend on the atmosphere, if it has one, Thomas Barclay of NASA's Kepler mission said. And scientists right now don't have the technology to know what the atmosphere is. The star's size -- it's an M-dwarf star, smaller and less hot than our sun -- also could come into play. Because it is smaller, the habitable zone is closer, so radiation could prevent life if the atmosphere isn't dense enough, said Victoria Meadows of the University of Washington Virtual Planetary Laboratory. But the Webb space-based telescope, now under construction, should be able to gather images of planets around closer dwarf stars and study their atmospheres. Scientists are especially keen about checking dwarf stars because their habitable planets are more easily detectable, and because they are the most abundant type of star in our galaxy, Barclay said. For researchers, the discovery of Kepler-186f is like a beginning.  It's a first but ""not a record we wish to keep,"" Quintana said.  ""We want to find more of these."" It's likely they will.  Astronomers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Hawaii, using data from Kepler, estimate there are tens of billions of Earth-size, possibly habitable planets in our Milky Way galaxy.","Researchers find an Earth-sized planet that may be habitable .
It ""proves the existence of worlds that might be similar to our own,"" institute says .

"(CNN) -- A child was killed Friday because that child went to school. The shooting Friday at a high school in Marysville, Washington -- just miles from my home in Seattle -- is a tragedy on two levels. First, most profoundly, two people are dead, four others wounded, and the parents, relatives, friends, teachers and classmates of the shooter and his victims have had their lives grievously changed. But this is not the first shooting in and around schools and colleges in America since the most infamous shooting at Sandy Hook. There have been many. (The exact numbers differ depending on how you count.) The other tragedy, then, is that gun violence -- in schools, in workplaces and across our communities -- has become virtually normal in America. It should not be. It cannot be. It is not normal, in a civilized nation, to have over 30,000 gun deaths a year. It is not normal, in a civilized nation, to expect educators and parents and first responders to have plans at the ready for a shooting at their school. It is not normal, in a civilized nation, to assert that the best solution to gun violence is for more people to have more access to more guns. So the question we must confront is: Are we a civilized nation? Earlier this week, I listened to a BBC correspondent open a report on the shootings in Ottawa, Ontario, by saying: ""In a scene reminiscent of America... ."" That is not the kind of exceptionalism America should be proud of. Though the Ebola crisis makes us rightly careful about using the word ""epidemic,"" it is no overstatement to say that the United States has been in a years-long epidemic of gun violence. The sheer volume of homicides, accidental killings, suicides and merely disabling injuries is staggering. The number, both in absolute and per capita terms, exceeds by many times that of any other developed country on Earth. What also makes this an epidemic is that it is contagious. The more it spreads, the more it spreads. The more that a minority of citizens block prevention and treatment, the less effective prevention and treatment become for all. To put it bluntly, gun violence is orders of magnitude more deadly to Americans than Ebola. So, what do we do about the public health crisis of gun violence? We have to turn to both law and norms. Many gun-rights absolutists respond to the death and mayhem of a Marysville or a Sandy Hook by saying that a particular gun law -- say, background checks for gun purchases -- wouldn't have prevented that tragedy. But when someone driving under the speed limit dies in a car wreck, we don't throw out speed limits and declare them an ineffective burden. We recognize that speed limits and seat belt laws are part of a grown-up system of rules that reduce the overall likelihood of traffic fatalities. In precisely the same way, a requirement of background checks for gun purchases reduces the overall likelihood that people will die of gun violence. That's why in the state of Washington, I've been working with other citizens to secure passage of a ballot initiative that will create such background checks. And it's why that measure seems to most people here not like tyranny but like common sense. The challenge extends beyond lawmaking to norm-setting. The coalition of parents, faith leaders, educators, businesspeople and others in Washington who are uniting behind background checks do so in the name of a core social norm: responsibility. All our American rights -- and particularly Second Amendment rights -- come with responsibilities. The responsibility, for instance, to minimize the danger inherently created by the circulation of weapons that can kill en masse. The responsibility to foster a culture of safety, especially for our youth. When middle-aged ""open-carry"" activists walk into Kroger with semi-automatic rifles slung over their shoulders, they aren't exercising their rights with an ethic of responsibility. They're trying to intimidate their way to respect and esteem. They're acting out, demanding attention and rejecting curbs on their desires. That's not being a citizen. It's being a toddler. We the people get to decide whether that's normal. Whether it's acceptable or laughable to brandish firearms in the produce aisle. Whether it's tolerable or disgraceful that we average more than one school shooting a week now. Laws like background checks can help set a tone for what's OK. But ultimately, with our family and friends and neighbors, each one of us must decide what kind of civilization we expect in the United States. Somebody's child was killed Friday because that child went to school. Somebody has to do something about it. In ways full of both risk and responsibility, you are that somebody.","Eric Liu: A child was killed because he went to school in Marysville, Washington, today .
Liu: Steady stream of shootings makes them virtually normal. Is this ""American exceptionalism""?
It's contagious epidemic. Gun activists wrongly say background checks won't help, he says .
Liu: We the people must set tone, standards, with laws, norms. It's our responsibility ."
"The number of new Ebola cases is growing faster than the ability of health officials to handle them, the head of the World Health Organization said Friday. ""In the three hardest hit countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them in the Ebola-specific treatment centers,"" said Margaret Chan, the WHO director-general. ""Today, there is not one single bed available for the treatment of an Ebola patient in the entire country of Liberia."" This week, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced it will donate $50 million to help fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. At least 2,400 people have died in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the outbreak has been concentrated, Chan said. Cases have also been reported in nearby Nigeria and Senegal. The foundation says the money will be used to enable international aid organizations and national governments ""to purchase badly needed supplies and scale up emergency operations in affected countries."" This is considered the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. The World Health Organization said Monday the rapid spread of the virus in Liberia shows no sign of slowing. ""The number of new cases is increasing exponentially,"" the WHO said, calling the situation a ""dire emergency with ... unprecedented dimensions of human suffering."" Taxis packed with families who fear they've contracted the deadly virus crisscross the Liberian capital, searching for a place where they can be treated, the WHO said. ""As soon as a new Ebola treatment facility is opened, it immediately fills to overflowing with patients,"" the U.N. group said. To help ease some of the burden on West Africa's already overtaxed medical system, the United States announced Tuesday it will send $10 million in additional funds. That's in addition to the $100 million Washington has already sent to help fight the outbreak. USAID also announced it will make $75 million in extra funds available. The new funds will pay for transportation and support to send 100 more health care workers to help fight the epidemic. The WHO and several nonprofit agencies on the ground have repeatedly called for the international community to send additional trained help. USAID funding has already provided 130,000 sets of personal protective equipment, 50,000 hygiene kits and 1,000 new beds. USAID has created a website where trained nurses, physician assistants and doctors who want to help can sign up. On Sunday, President Barack Obama said the Ebola outbreak needs to be a ""national security priority."" He told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the U.S. military could help set up isolation units and provide security for public health workers. ""If we don't make that effort now, and this spreads not just through Africa but other parts of the world, there's the prospect then that the virus mutates. It becomes more easily transmittable. And then it could be a serious danger to the United States,"" he said.

"Plane spotters sometimes talk about grabbing a ""Wayne's World"" moment. If you've seen the 1992 movie, you may remember when Mike Myers as Wayne and Dana Carvey as Garth are parked near an airport runway. They're reclining on the hood of a funky AMC Pacer, discussing ""Babe-raham Lincoln,"" when suddenly a huge airliner swoops by just a few feet overhead. That's when they begin screaming above the airplane's deafening roar. Phil Derner admits it. ""I've done that. There are so many times when I just want to ... lay down near the approach lights and watch the planes go overhead and just take it in."" He's talking about plane spotting. Beginning around the mid-20th century, countless plane spotters have been trotting the globe to view and photograph the world's most impressive aircraft. Schwing! ""Some people like cars,"" said Derner. ""But we like something that's bigger and faster, and it freaking flies."" Derner, who created the plane spotting site NYCAviation.com in 2003, said the hobby is growing more popular as more people are lured in by the magic of flying machines. Think about it, said Derner, ""Something that weighs up to a million pounds is taking to the air, and you know the next time it comes down is going to be on the other side of the world. I think that's fascinating."" ""It's a passion that keeps me sane,"" said Chicago-based spotter Kevin Koske. Read this plane spotting how-to. Intrigued? We've listed some tips and suggested vantage points below. But first, let's talk about what's arguably the most famous plane spotting destination on the planet: Maho Beach on the tiny Caribbean island of St. Maarten. You may have seen Maho in unbelievable interweb photos showing giant airliners flying just a few dozen feet above the beach. These photos went viral years ago, and no, they aren't Photoshopped. They're real. ""If you like airplanes, Maho is like the cherry on top"" of a beautiful beach vacation, said Justin Schlechter, a 747 pilot who's visited Maho several times. For Koske, Maho is the ""mecca of airplane spotting."" The beach sits at one end of a short runway at Princess Juliana International Airport. The short runway forces approaching planes to come in low, about 30 to 50 feet over the beach. Larger planes need to touchdown as close as possible to the end of the runway because they need as much runway as they can get. As a result, plane spotters get one of the world's closest public views of giant airliners as they take off and land. ""It's a lot closer than you can get at a typical airport, in the States especially,"" said Schlechter. Read more about Schlechter's trips to Maho. There's a bar on the beach, the Sunset Bar & Grill, where customers cheer with each flyover. ""They go crazy,"" said Dianne Carbon, an employee there. ""People literally try to see if they can touch the planes,"" she said. ""In our office, when they're taking off or coming in, it's almost like it was an earthquake."" But paradise for plane spotters also has its dangers. When airliners prepare for take off and rev their engines, daredevils will stand against the airport fence and hold on. The jet blast is powerful enough to throw people off the fence and onto the ground. Spotters say their hobby is more than a celebration of aviation. It's about fully recognizing the majesty of machines that give us the super power to defy gravity. And, perhaps surprisingly, it's also about camaraderie. Yes, that is correct. Plane spotting at popular vantage points comes with a social bonus. ""When you have a group of 20 people with a lot of different personalities and people from all walks of life, it's a very diverse group, and we have a great time,"" said Derner. Some plane spotters will even hook up on occasion, Derner said, because obviously there's nothing more romantic than a roaring Airbus A380 blotting out the moon and lighting up the night sky. Derner said he met his girlfirend, his ""Babe-raham Lincoln"" if you will, a year and a half ago when she responded to his tweets about plane spotting. Oh yeah, and she's a pilot. Koske, who's a Chicago radio host when he's not chasing aircraft, made a long anticipated journey to Los Angeles last September to visit Imperial Hill, the primo vantage point for spotters at LAX. ""To finally go out there and spend four days spotting, sun up to sun down, was just great."" What's on his bucket list? Amsterdam, a spotter-friendly airport with aircraft rarely seen in the United States. Excellent, as Wayne might say. You told us: Top 5 spots for plane geeks . TipsAs promised, here are a few plane spotting tips shared by Derner, Koske and aviation enthusiast Rob Mark at Jetwhine.com: . 1. In general, stay off airport grounds. Airport security for obvious reasons can be very sensitive about curious strangers wandering the property with expensive photo gear. Worst case: you could be arrested and your equipment could be confiscated. Best case: you could be politely asked to leave. Some airports such as Amsterdam and Frankfurt offer public observation areas. 2. ""Always carry ID and wear a smile,"" said Derner. Police patrolling areas around the airport may question you. Most of the time, they're OK with plane spotting activities. But sometimes they're not. Rule of thumb: be nice. 3. Some of the best spots are located in parking lots of private businesses. If asked by an employee, you must leave. Where planes go to die . Spots . This isn't a ranking list or obviously a comprehensive list, but here are a few good plane spotting sites: . 1. Eagle County Airport, Colorado: The Costco parking lot at 170 Cooley Mesa Road, Gypsum, Colorado . 2. O'Hare International Airport, Chicago: southeast of the airport at the USG Building parking lot near Mannheim Road and Lawrence Avenue . 3. LaGuardia Airport, New York: Landing Lights Park, south of the airport off 25th Avenue between 78th and 79th streets; Planeview Park south of the airport on 23rd Avenue next to Vaughn College . 4. John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York: southeast of the airport in the parking lot near Bay Boulevard and Rockaway Turnpike . 5. Los Angeles International Airport: Imperial Hill, south of the airport near Imperial Avenue and Sheldon Street; In-n-Out Burger, northeast of the airport near West 92nd Street and South Sepulveda Boulevard . 6. Manchester Airport, England: south of the airport off Altrincham Road, according to plane-mad.com . 7. Frankfurt, Germany, airport observation deck: Terminal 2, Concourse E next to McDonald's . 8. Amsterdam Schiphol airport Panorama Terrace: between Arrival Halls 1 and 2 and via Arrival Hall 3 . 9. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport: Gravelly Point Park, Arlington, Virginia, north of the airport off George Washington Memorial Parkway . The place where dead airplanes come back to life . Daytrippers . One more thing: if you find yourself booking airline day trips to spot planes in nearby cities, well, clearly you're hooked. Derner admits to hopping flights from New York to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport's unique gawking spot built on a landfill. It's called Gravelly Point Park. Watch a cool YouTube video. What's so special? Planes zoom as low as 100 feet above your head as they aim for the runway about 400 feet from the park. Aside from its amazing proximity to the aircraft, Gravelly Point rocks because it's within walking distance of the airport terminal. ""You don't have to rent a car,"" said Derner. ""Just walk over, watch planes and then just fly home."" One final tip for newby plane spotters, and it's a direct quote from that scene in ""Wayne's World:"" Like Wayne says as the airliner passes overhead, ""Keep looking up!""

"The first thing I noticed as we drove into the indigenous Talang Mamak village of Semerantihan was a giant satellite dish. Immediately I knew this village was very different from the traditional Talang Mamak villages I had read about before coming to Sumatra. These villagers had houses built for them by the government in 1995 when the 30 Hills National Park was established. They had a generator, given to them by a timber company, to power lights and a television. We were a western television crew in giant trucks that had just driven in to film, and the villagers, who knew we were coming, didn't seem bothered by us at all. It's hard to imagine all the changes these Semerantihan village elders, seemingly in their forties and fifties, had seen in their lifetimes. In the last few decades, deforestation has taken around half of Sumatra's rainforest, changing the physical landscape and the social dynamic for these indigenous people. Read more: Why you should care about Sumatra's rainforest . Traditionally, Talang Mamak people would have lived in dwellings on stilts with walls made out of bark. They would have hunted and gathered everything they needed from the surrounding rainforest and they would have had very little interaction with the outside world. We came here with the Frankfurt Zoological Society who have set up an education program in more than 30 villages surrounding 30 Hills National Park. The educators work with each of the villages, teaching the people about conservation and their work releasing former-pet orangutans. Their main goals are to help villagers appreciate the forest and keep the villagers from hunting or killing the orangutans. FZS educators come to this village twice a month to talk to the elders and hold classes for the kids. Walking into the classroom, this seemed like any other western school. It was a two-room building with a tile floor and the kids were a range of ages from around 5 to 10 years old. They wore brightly colored clothing, some with western logos like SpongeBob SquarePants. Their desks were pushed up against the wall and the children were sitting in a circle learning from the two FZS educators. The children colored pictures, drew animals, sang songs and played games. Interactive: Mission to save Sumatra's rainforest . What struck me the most about these children is that they were so well behaved and seemed to really enjoy the class. We joined them, filming and participating in the activities. The kids didn't seem to mind at all. Going back through the footage, none of the children acted out to the cameras. Most of them didn't even look at our cameramen Scott and John as they were filming. In a classroom in the U.S., that wouldn't have been the case. A few of the adult villagers leaned against the walls outside waiting for the class to finish. I had read about Talang Mamak people shunning the outside world, refusing to educate their children and insisting on living the way their ancestors had lived. This village seemed to have embraced their western neighbors and many of their habits. They still kept to some of the old traditions, though. They survived on hunting wild pig, as we found out when one of the villagers came by with his spear during our interview with the village chief. It was also then that we learned that they were animists, a religion believing that animals, plants and places have a spiritual significance. Read more: Profitable palm oil leaves environment poor . The villagers were so well adapted to the outside world, I had expected them to have converted to Islam, the main religion in Indonesia. Villagers here gather non-timber forest products like a medicinal plant they called ""dragonsblood"" which they sell to by petrol for their generators. But as more and more of the surrounding rainforest is cut down, the elders of the village worry what will happen to their way of life if the forest is completely cut down. These villagers have all adapted so much to the outside world already. Would their traditions, passed down from generations of Talang Mamak people, disappear? Would a way of life that had endured centuries die out because of the encroaching timber, palm and paper industries?","Jenni Watts produced Expedition: Sumatra, CNN's new environment special .

"(CNN) -- There are 5 1/2 feet of snow outside and on top of Chrissy Hazard's home in the Buffalo suburb of Cheektowaga, New York. A treadmill and table prop up a door felled by the snow's attempted push into the home. But everything's all right for now, she told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""We're good. We're buried in the house but we're doing OK,"" she said. Hazard is stuck inside the home with her husband, a friend, seven children and some dogs. It may be three or four days before they can get out, she said. There is a small patch of yard that offers the pups a chance to go outside. And there's more wintery precipitation on the way after a respite Wednesday. CNN Severe Weather Expert Chad Myers said that 20 to 30 more inches of snow will fall Thursday during a 10-hour window. There is so much snow, Buffalo officials aren't even plowing. Instead hundreds of dump trucks venture out to haul snow away from the 10 square miles that have been pummeled by the lake-effect snow. Other areas of New York's second-most populous city only received 1 to 6 inches, officials said. Seven deaths in the region -- including one man whose car was buried under more than a foot of snow -- are blamed on the extreme storm, authorities said. Firefighters came to check on the Hazard family on Tuesday as many emergency workers put in double shifts and got little sleep. Stories about acts of bravery and kindness were emerging even as the snow was piling up and up in the city on Lake Erie. Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown and city officials Wednesday recounted stories of rescuers trudging around snow drifts as high as houses to get people to hospitals, of fire stations turned into temporary shelters and police officers delivering special baby formula to a pair of infants. ""It is clear that we are one Buffalo,"" Brown said. Buffalo prides itself as ""The City of Good Neighbors."" ""Buffalo itself, known as a city of neighbors, has come together and shown a real sense of community and neighbor helping neighbor, which is always good to see,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters. Snow across the land . About 50% of the United States had snow on the ground Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. There were also forecasts for heavy snow for counties in Michigan and Vermont. All 50 states registered temperatures below freezing Tuesday morning, even traditionally warm ones. Temperatures at Mauna Kea on Hawaii's Big Island dipped to 31 degrees while Florida's Panhandle was in the upper 20s, with freeze warnings in effect. The cause of this mayhem: Arctic air pouring over the relatively warm waters of the Great Lakes is producing extreme lake-effect snows. Unheard of amounts of snow . Buffalo Niagara International Airport, about a 20-minute drive from downtown, was operating Wednesday afternoon but many people were having trouble navigating the snow-covered streets to get to the airport. Most airlines canceled some flights, according to airline representatives and airport spokesman C. Douglas Hartmayer. ""This storm is basically a knife that went right through the heart of Erie County,"" said Mark Poloncarz, Erie County executive. ""I can't remember and I don't think anyone else can remember this much snow falling in this short a period."" Mayor Brown and other western New York officials said the cost of cleaning up after this week's storm will be significant, requiring the city and neighboring municipalities to seek assistance from the state and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Buffalo State Assemblyman Sean Ryan Wednesday said the area may get ""more snowfall this week than the rest of the whole winter combined,"" wiping out entire storm budgets in one event. Wednesday night's football game between the State University of New York, Buffalo and Kent State was postponed because of travel issues. The Buffalo Bills, who play the New York Jets on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET, are seeking the public's help to clear an estimated 220,000 tons of snow from Ralph Wilson Stadium, the team announced on its website. The helpers will be paid $10 an hour, plus game tickets if they work a certain number of hours. The team said the NFL would decide if the game should be rescheduled. Temperatures are expected to break through freezing on Saturday and reach the 50s on Sunday, the National Weather Service said. But rain is also likely. ""That would be a terrible thing,"" Myers said. ""If it rains -- and it probably will at least on the weekend -- all of that snow is not going to melt right away. That snow is going to hold that rain in and then that snow on top is going to get heavier and heavier."" This is only the area's first snowfall of the winter, but South Buffalo has seen almost as much snow in 24 hours as it experiences in an entire season. About 84 inches is normal, but about 6 feet -- 72 inches -- has fallen since Tuesday. Brown predicted a ""long way to go"" before efforts to clear Buffalo's roadways are finished. Already, more than 6,500 tons of snow have been removed from city streets and highways. ""It is going to be a slow go,"" the mayor said. ""Historic amounts of snow have fallen. There is no place to put that snow."" A driving ban remains in effect in South Buffalo, with rescuers using snowmobiles to respond to emergency calls. Emboldened by Wednesday's sunshine many people headed out onto the streets only to find themselves stranded. Authorities received 12 calls from people stuck in the snow. Thankfully, there were relatively few power outages in and near Buffalo, where 72 customers didn't have electricity Wednesday night, New York State Electric and Gas Corp. reported. Snow fatalities . Of the seven deaths blamed on the storm, six were in Erie County and one in Genesee County. Erie County officials said one of the deaths was from a car accident and three other people died due to cardiac issues that resulted from shoveling snow. In Alden, New York, a 46-year-old man was found dead inside a car buried in 12 to 15 feet of snow, authorities said. In Genesee County, Jack Boyce, a 56-year-old county employee, died after collapsing Tuesday morning while operating a snow blower outside the county sheriff's office, according to county manager Jay Gsell. On Wednesday, Erie County Health Commissioner Dr. Gale Burstein said an elderly man with a known heart condition had died. ""He had an exacerbation of his condition where he needed emergency medical care and he was unable to be transported to a care facility that had the highest level of care,"" she said, adding that the patient died at an ""urgent care center."" Trapped at the fire station . The snow left people stranded in cars and turned roadways into parking lots. It also forced residents to seek shelter in unusual places. About 70 people took refuge at a Buffalo fire station and 20 others holed up in a police station Tuesday night, authorities said. By morning, most had returned home. And as they waited, those at the fire station got a teeny weeny gift. A baby girl was delivered there when an ambulance was unable to take her mother to the hospital, Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield said. ""She was born, she's safe and she's healthy,"" Whitfield said. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Faith Karimi, Daniel Verello, Kevin Dotson, Chuck Johnston, Martin Savidge and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: 20 to 30 more inches of snow expected Thursday .

"To people on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, and many around the world who watched it unfold, it seemed like a scene out of another country. ""They are now firing into the crowd,"" a reporter says Wednesday night as loud blasts and fiery sparks show tear gas canisters apparently being shot by police. Screams follow. ""They're firing rubber bullets,"" a reporter with KARG Argus Radio is heard saying on video. ""They're attacking reporters; they are attacking civilians. They are firing up on the media."" Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said pepper bullets were used. A CNN crew also found spent crowd-control stun grenades lying in the street. All the details of what happened amid protests over a police officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed teen have yet to come in. Multiple law enforcement agencies from the city, county and state levels have been dispatched to calm the protests. In the chaos, it was not immediately clear which agencies did what exactly -- though Ferguson Mayor Jay Knowles did say Thursday that St. Louis County police have been ""in charge tactically since Sunday."" Change is coming. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced Thursday the Missouri State Highway Patrol will head up security because ""at this particular point, the attitudes weren't improving."" Missouri state troopers take over security in Ferguson . Even if things turn around quickly, though, it won't erase the memories from this past week or end the debate about tactics. Chief among them are decisions like deploying heavily armed officers and using military equipment, which some experts say helped to make a bad situation even worse. Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honore knows a thing or two about this kind of thing, having been dispatched to New Orleans in 2005 to lead recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina. What authorities in Ferguson should have done, he said, is have ""front line policemen"" to face protesters, not a SWAT team. ""The tactics they are using, I don't know where they learned them from,""  Honore said Thursday on ""CNN Newsroom."" ""It appears they may be making them up on the way. But this is escalating the situation."" 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . What should police do with unruly protesters? Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, echoed that view Thursday, saying her ""constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests, and the police need to respect that right and protect that right."" ""This kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution,"" she added. Police said they responded with force only after the Molotov cocktails were thrown at them, and news photos showed some young men in the crowd lighting them. Yet Alderman Antonio French of St. Louis disputes this sequence, saying police started the violence and protesters responded. Joey Jackson, an HLN legal analyst, said if there are some protesters who are unruly -- unlike the majority -- then police ""need to isolate those people and perhaps respond to them as opposed to firing upon the crowd in general."" But the chief said police can't possibly go through the crowd and just remove certain individuals. ""If the crowd is getting violent, and you don't want to be violent, get out of the crowd,"" he said of protesters. Mike Brooks, a former Washington police official who now serves as HLN's law enforcement analyst, cautioned against rushing to judge police over Wednesday night's fighting.  ""If there were, being thrown, rocks and bottles and Molotov cocktails, then they had to respond in kind,"" he argued. But Brooks also said he has serious questions about the arrest of two journalists inside a McDonald's by an officer who, according to reports, refused to provide his name. ""Why did the police come in and ask them to leave?"" Brooks asks. If there were a problem, it would be ""up to the manager, the general manger of that establishment, to ask them to leave. I want to know what department these officers were from.  And if I ask an officer, 'What is your name and badge number,' that officer better give it to me."" Michael Brown shooting, protests highlight racial divide . 'In middle America, you don't need leftover equipment from Iraq' Critics of the law enforcement response include Attorney General Eric Holder, who said ""the scenes playing out in the streets of Ferguson over the last several nights cannot continue."" Some blame lay with protesters, he said. Even though ""the vast majority ... have been peaceful,"" others have been marred by violence, looting and antagonizing of law enforcement. Yet law enforcement's aim should be to ""reduce tensions, not heighten them,"" he said. That means respecting ""at all times"" the rights of those gathered to express sympathy with Brown's family as well as the ability of journalists to report the story. (Two reporters were detained and then released without charges Wednesday.) ""At a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community, I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,"" Holder added. Throughout the week, authorities in Ferguson have said the armored vehicles and weaponry have been in place to keep the peace. Yet civil liberty advocates and others disagree, saying the response in Ferguson is symptomatic of larger, disturbing trends in law enforcement. In an extensive report issued weeks ago, the American Civil Liberties Union stated ""American policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized, in large part through federal programs that have armed state and local law enforcement agencies with the weapons and tactics of war, with almost no public discussion or oversight."" ""Militarization of policing encourages officers to adopt a 'warrior' mentality and think of the people they are supposed to serve as enemies,"" the report added. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver is among those who don't think such equipment makes sense in Ferguson. He told CNN he and Rep. Lacy Clay want to personally urge Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to institute ""very stringent requirements"" whenever military equipment is disbursed, including special training of police. ""I think the heavy equipment probably should go to only cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, where there is always a threat of some kind of a terrorist attack,"" Cleaver said. ""But in middle America, you don't need leftover equipment from Iraq."" Veterans critical of police response . Josh Weinberg, an Army veteran who focuses on security issues for the Truman Project, contends that police sometimes do ""need high-powered weaponry"" and other tools to go after ""up-armored"" and heavily armed criminals. ""It's really scary,"" he says. But that doesn't mean the way Ferguson police used some of that equipment made sense, he argues. Videos showed ""a bunch of guys on top of an armored personnel carrier,"" Weinberg said.  ""When we're rolling around in Afghanistan and there is a threat of being shot, you don't sit on top of an APC. That defeats the purpose."" Weinberg says it's unfair to the military to call what happened in Ferguson evidence of ""militarization,"" saying U.S. soldiers are well ""trained in escalation of force."" The police apparently ""had their weapons up and pointed at protesters who are obviously unarmed,"" he said.  In the military, he learned that ""your force posture matches the threat.

"He was a powerful Russian businessman whose falling-out with his government left him self-exiled in England. He blamed the Kremlin for the death of a former Russian spy who was poisoned by radioactive material. Now, Boris Berezovsky himself is dead. Police scouring the scene Sunday have found no sign so far of ""third party involvement,"" a detective said. But details surrounding Berezovsky's death remain a mystery. Police say they haven't determined the cause. After a paramedic's radiation detector went off at the scene, investigators declared the area ""safe and clear to work in,"" the Thames Valley Police said in a statement Sunday. They did not specify what they believe triggered the alert, but emergency officials from the South Central Ambulance Service said the device, which is a regular part of paramedics' kits, can register false alarms. As forensic investigators combed the scene Sunday, Berezovsky's body was still inside his house. On Saturday, a bodyguard told police he found Berezovsky lying on the bathroom floor. Speculation over the tycoon's cause of death ran the gamut from suicide to heart attack. Some pointed to his declining fortune as a possible clue. Last year Berezovksy lost what has been called one of the most expensive private lawsuits in history. ""Initial suggestions that Berezovsky may have committed suicide were quickly quashed by his close associates,"" Russia's state-owned RIA Novosti news agency reported. The agency said a family friend told Russian media that Berezovsky had suffered a heart attack. ""It would be wrong to speculate on the cause of death until the post mortem has been carried out,""  Kevin Brown, the deputy senior investigating officer in the case, said in a statement. ""The investigation team are building a picture of the last days of Mr. Berezovsky's life,"" he said, ""speaking to close friends and family to gain a better understanding of his state of mind."" A Putin foe . Berezovsky, a staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, accused the Kremlin of causing the 2006 death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned with the radioactive substance polonium-210. Like Berezovsky, Litvinenko had fled to England. In a deathbed statement, Litvinenko blamed Putin, an accusation the Kremlin strongly denied. The British government has evidence Russia was involved in Litvinenko's death, a British lawyer said in December. Russia did not immediately comment on the claims of evidence of its involvement in Litvinenko's death. For years, Berezovsky bankrolled the effort of Litvinenko's widow to push for an inquest into her husband's death. Berezovsky later sued a Russian broadcaster for libel after it claimed in a report that he was behind the death of Litvinenko. He won the claim against All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, and the High Court in London awarded him 150,000 pounds ($223,400) in damages. From math professor to oligarch . Berezovsky began his working life as a math professor and then became a systems analyst who switched to more lucrative jobs in post-Soviet Russia, said CNN's Jill Dougherty, who interviewed him many times. Berezovsky went on to sell cars ""at a time when that was a luxury,"" she said. ""There were a lot of people who wanted to buy them, and he parlayed that -- as so many of these oligarchs did -- into something much, much bigger."" While Berezovsky made a good portion of his money from luxury car sales, his wealth and political influence skyrocketed when he bought into Russian media. He invested in the Moscow Independent Broadcasting Corp., which -- with TBS as a partner -- founded Moscow's first independent television station, TV-6. Under President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian Federation's first president from 1991 to 1999, ""there were really no rules governing anything,"" Dougherty said. Businessmen who came to be known as oligarchs amassed massive wealth and political influence in the 1990s during the privatization of Russia following the fall of the Soviet Union. Businessmen like Berezovsky wound up lending the fledgling Russian government money ""when it was desperate for money,"" Dougherty said. ""These guys picked up companies on the cheap -- for pennies on the dollar."" A year or two later, the companies were worth much more, and the owners became wealthy. In return for backing Yeltsin, Berezovsky gained political influence within the Kremlin. He later backed Putin for president, pouring money into the latter's political party. Fall from political favor . But after he was elected, Putin saw that the oligarchs had the potential to gain too much political power and moved to thwart them, Dougherty said. It has been widely reported that Putin resented the meddling of the oligarchs, particularly Berezovsky. ""He was obviously very ambitious, and he wanted, I think, to be in political control of Russia during Yeltsin's time, and that didn't work out for him,"" said Stuart Loory, a former Turner Broadcasting System executive vice president, who was a consultant to Berezovsky during the 1990s. Berezovsky did not have an easy time of it as an oligarch. ""There were two attempts on his life, one at his country home outside Moscow in a gated community. Somebody planted a bomb in his car and, fortunately, it didn't work very well,"" Loory said. ""And the other was when he was leaving his club and there was a car bomb in the car and his driver was killed and he escaped without injury."" Fleeing to England . Within months of Putin's election in 2000, the government began trying to collect on tax claims against the oligarchs, including Berezovsky. That's when Berezovsky fled. Berezovsky began agitating from Britain against Putin, calling for a coup to oust the Russian president. In 2003, as Russia was seeking his return, Berezovsky was granted political asylum by British authorities after they realized he was wanted on political grounds, not criminal, according to published reports at the time. The case strained relations between Moscow and London. Berezovsky was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in absentia by a Russian court in 2007. But about two months ago, he sent a letter to Putin asking permission to return to Russia, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. ""He admitted that he had made a lot of mistakes, asked forgiveness for the mistakes and asked Putin to let him return home,"" Peskov said, according to a duty officer with the presidential press service. It's unknown whether Putin responded to the letter, but Berezovsky did not return. Putin has been told of Berezovsky's death, Peskov told Russian state television. A declining fortune . Berezovsky was found Saturday afternoon by his bodyguard at his home in the affluent community of Ascot, Berkshire, west of London, said an official at Bell Pottinger, a public relations firm that represented Berezovsky. The bodyguard told police he forced open a bathroom door that had been locked from the inside and found Berezovsky's body on the floor. Berezovsky made headlines last year after losing what has been called one of the most expensive private lawsuits in history against a former friend and ally, Russian magnate Roman Abramovich. Berezovsky sued Abramovich, owner of the Chelsea Football Club, for $5.1 billion, alleging that he was forced to sell his stake in the Russian oil company Sibneft for a fraction of its true value. The judge called Berezovsky's testimony unreliable and, at points, dishonest. The case raised a public curtain on the world of Russia's oligarchs. Berezovsky's fortune has reportedly been on the decline in recent years, and it took a huge hit after he lost the case against Abramovich. Analysts put the price tag for legal fees alone at more than $250 million spent between the two figures. In recent weeks, reports emerged that Berezovsky was trying to sell pieces of his estate, including an Andy Warhol painting, ""Red Lenin,"" to pay debts. Damian Kudriavtsev, a friend of Berezovsky, said Sunday that his friend was unhappy and was in financial trouble, but wouldn't have harmed himself. Berezovsky, he said, had always hoped to return to Russia someday.","After a radiation detector goes off, authorities investigate and declare the scene safe .

"Republicans who pressed President Barack Obama for a more coordinated federal response to the Ebola outbreak are blasting the appointment of Ron Klain, a veteran Democratic political aide, as the ""Ebola czar."" ""This appointment is both shocking and frankly tone deaf to what the American people are concerned about,"" Pennsylvania Rep. Tim Murphy said in a written statement. Murphy chaired a hearing on Thursday on the federal government's response to the outbreak and said the decision to tap Klain won't calm those Americans who are worried about the spread of the disease. First on CNN: Obama will name Ron Klain as Ebola Czar . One after another, top GOP members on Capitol Hill zeroed in on Klain's campaign experience as the wrong kind of background for the post. ""While the President's pick may have the ear of the White House and experience from the campaign trail, I am concerned he doesn't have significant relationships in the medical community that are imperative during this current biological emergency,"" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said. McCaul called on the President to rethink his selection, and instead create a permanent position within the government to coordinate the response. Another Texas Republican wasn't impressed, either. ""We don't need another so-called 'czar'; we need presidential leadership. This is a public health crisis, and the answer isn't another White House political operative,"" Sen. Ted Cruz said in a statement. A former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden and also to then-Vice President Al Gore, Klain is currently president of Case Holdings and general counsel of Revolution, an investment group. He has clerked for the U.S. Supreme Court and headed up Gore's effort during the 2000 Florida recount. Midterm campaigns swing through Ebola hearing . House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-California, also questioned Klain's credentials, asking in a written statement, ""why the President didn't pick an individual with a noteworthy infectious disease or public health background?"" But the White House defended the choice, saying it's not just about medical expertise. Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters, ""That's why somebody with Mr. Klain's credentials, somebody that has strong management experience, both inside government, but also in the private sector, he's somebody that has strong relationships with members of Congress and, obviously, strong relationships with those of us who worked with him here at the White House earlier in the administration."" GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona suggested on CNN last Sunday that the administration needed one point person.  ""... I would say we don't know exactly who's in charge. There has to be some kind of czar,"" McCain said. But the White House initially resisted the idea, and pointed out that McCain said in 2009 that the Obama administration had ""more czars than the Romanovs."" Kerry sends out call to arms on the Ebola crisis .","Republicans are against the president's decision to appoint Ron Klain as the ""Ebola czar""

"A shooting instructor is dead, the victim of a gun-range accident. A 9-year-old girl is surely traumatized. And plenty of people, including many gun enthusiasts, are asking: Why give a child a submachine gun to shoot? The deadly incident occurred Monday morning at a gun range in Arizona that caters to Las Vegas tourists, many of whom drive an hour from the gambling center to fire high-powered weapons. Charles Vacca was accidentally shot in the head as he instructed the 9-year-old girl how to fire an Uzi, an Israeli-made 9mm submachine gun. As she pulled the trigger, the gun jumped out of her left hand toward Vacca, who was standing beside her. ""To put an Uzi in the hands of a 9-year-old ... is extremely reckless, "" CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said. Gun experts contacted by CNN on Wednesday said young children should be taught to shoot with single-shot firearms rather than submachine guns. They also said that safe learning is connected to the ability and experience of the instructor. ""It's always the supervision,"" said Greg Danas, president of Massachusetts-based G&G Firearms. ""But you also have gun enthusiasts running businesses where they place firearms in the hands of the uninformed, whether they're 9-year-old kids who are not capable or adults. It all stems from gun enthusiasts running businesses that require a level of professionalism and education. The unexpected with firearms is something that's only learned through years of being a trainer, not a gun enthusiast."" Representatives of the gun range declined CNN requests for comment on the incident. But Sam Scarmardo, who operates Bullets and Burgers, told CNN affiliate KLAS on Tuesday they ""really don't know what happened."" ""Our guys are trained to basically hover over people when they're shooting,"" Scarmardo said. ""If they're shooting right-handed, we have our right-hand behind them ready to push the weapon out of the way. And if they're left-handed, the same thing."" Vacca had his right hand on the girl's back and his left hand under her right arm when he was shot. Opinion: Why is a 9-year-old firing an Uzi? Danas questioned why the instructor in Arizona was standing immediately to the left of the Uzi, which would have recoiled in that direction. ""It's an awful shame,"" he said. ""He shouldn't have been to the left side of the gun... But that child should not have been shooting anything other than a single-shot firearm."" Danas, whose daughters are 11 and 13, said his girls learned to shoot when they were 4 years old, with a single-shot, .22-caliber pistol. Fuentes, who was a firearms instructor while he was with the FBI, said students are taught to fire in three-round bursts. It's not like in the movies where somebody shoots 30 rounds nonstop, he said. ""You're going to lose control."" The wrong gun? Greg Block, who runs California-based Self-Defense Firearms Training, said not only was the Uzi the wrong gun to use -- ""That's not a kid's gun"" -- but that instructors should stand to the rear and to the right of the shooter. ""He was literally in the line of fire,"" Block said of the instructor. ""He did pretty much everything wrong, and I don't like saying that because it cost the man his life."" Steven Howard, a Michigan-based gun expert who runs American Firearms & Munitions Consulting, said it was difficult to comment based on the limited information available about the Arizona shooting, but added that the clip on the submachine gun should not hold more than three rounds during instruction. ""Teaching people machine gun 101, even with adults, even with people going through military training, the first few times they shoot machine guns you don't have them shoot a full freaking clip,"" he said. ""The thing begins to fire and it begins to jump and buck all over the place. Your first human instinct is for your hands to clamp down, and you clamp down on the trigger and if the thing has a 32-round magazine ... it starts spraying all over and people get killed."" Some Uzi submachine guns can be modified to control the powerful recoil. Howard said some submachine guns can be used to train children. ""It can be done under the right circumstances,"" Howard said. ""There are some machine guns that I could have trained my 8-year-old on."" The website of Bullets and Burgers, the shooting range where the accident happened, says children between the ages of 8 and 17 can shoot a weapon if accompanied by a parent or guardian. Kids and guns: What's your parenting style? No charges to be filed . Chief Deputy Mohave County Attorney Jace Zack told CNN on Wednesday that prosecutors didn't foresee criminal charges. The Mohave County Sheriff's Office said the girl was with her parents. The three reside in New Jersey. Asked about the culpability of the girl's parents, he said: ""We have considered the parents, but if anyone was culpable it would be the instructor for putting a deadly weapon in her hands."" Authorities said the death was being handled as an industrial accident, with state occupational safety and health officials investigating. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also was notified. An autopsy on Vacca was completed but the cause and manner of death were pending, according to Colleen Pitre, a representative of the medical examiner's officer. She would not say how many times Vacca was shot. Video shows fatal shooting . In Arizona, cell phone video released by authorities Tuesday shows the moments before the fatal shots were fired, CNN affiliate KLAS reported. In the video, Vacca and the girl are at an outdoor range. The wind blows a target in the distance.  Vacca shows the child how to hold the gun and then helps her establish her grip and her stance. She fires one round and dirt flies above the target. Vacca adjusts the Uzi, places his right hand on her back and his left under her right arm. She fires several rounds in rapid succession and the gun kicks to the left as she loses control. Experts said an Uzi can fire five rounds one third of a second. The video ends before the fatal head shot. In releasing the video, authorities did not identify who made it. Vacca was married and well-liked, KLAS said. He was an active member of the California National Guard since May 1995, National Guard spokesman Brandon Honig said. The range says on its Facebook page: ""We separate ourselves from all other Las Vegas ranges with our unique 'Desert Storm' atmosphere and military style bunkers."" Bullets and Burgers is part of a tourism niche offering packages costing up to $1,000 to shoot different high-powered weapons. The range offers bachelorette parties, birthdays and weddings events. It is one of at least a dozen gun ranges in the Las Vegas area catering to tourists from around the world. ""This tragedy illustrates how you never know what could happen, and we really do need to use common sense when thinking about when a child can have access to a weapon like that,"" said Michael McLively of the California-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Child dies at gun show . In the Massachusetts incident, former Pelham Police Chief Edward Fleury was found not guilty in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter in the 2008 death of 8-year-old Christopher Bizilj, who was firing the micro Uzi when he accidentally shot himself in the head at a gun show Fleury helped organize. The boy died instantly. Fleury also was acquitted of three counts of furnishing a machine gun to a minor. Christopher's father, Charles Bizilj, was present at the time of the shooting and videotaped the entire incident. Parts of that tape were shown to the jury, which also heard emotional testimony from the father. ""I ran over to him. His eyes were open and I saw no reason for him to be on the ground,"" Bizilj told members of the Hampden County jury. ""And I tried to talk to him and he didn't respond. I put my hand behind his head to try to pick him up and there was a large portion of his cranium missing. And I put my hand against the back of his head.""","Experts question whether girl should have been handling a submachine gun .

"A 4-year-old boy was shot and killed by his 4-year-old female cousin while they were playing with a gun, Detroit police said. The shooting happened Thursday in a home on the city's west side. There were three children -- all cousins -- at the home at the time of the incident,  said Detroit Deputy Chief Rodney Johnson. The third child was 5, he said. Detroit Police Public Information Officer Adam Madera said the children found a ""long gun"" under a bed, pulled it out and began to play with it. ""At this time, although it's early in the investigation, this appears to be a tragic accident,"" Madera said. There was an adult present in the house, but that person was a family friend and unrelated to the children, Johnson said. ""It's too early to say if charges will be filed in this case,"" Johnson said. This is the latest incident involving children who accidentally shoot someone or die of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. In October, a babysitter in Vidor, Texas, was charged after her 5-year-old charge fatally shot himself with her gun, police said. Two weeks earlier, a 2-year-old girl fatally shot herself in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and the toddler's father faced involuntary manslaughter charges, police said. In New Orleans, a 5-year-old girl died June 23 after she came into contact with a .38-caliber revolver and accidentally shot herself in the head while her mother was at a store, police said. Last August, a 3-year-old boy in Dundee, Michigan, found a .40-caliber handgun belonging to a family friend on a closet floor in his home. He died after accidentally shooting himself in the head, police said. A study of Colorado trauma center data found a surprising number of children were being injured, many of them seriously, by guns. According to the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 703 children under the age of 15 died in accidental firearms deaths between 2001 and 2010, the latest year for which data are available.

"(CNN)Daniel Traub knew North Philadelphia in his youth, accompanying his artist mother from their home in the more affluent central Philly as she helped residents transform vacant lots with sculptures and murals. After growing up and working 10 years on photos examining economic divides in China, he knew where he wanted to look next. ""North Philadelphia"" is Traub's new 124-page portrait of the people and properties in a struggling area where more than 40% of residents in three local ZIP codes live below the poverty line. From crumbling buildings to abandoned lots long overgrown by nature, Traub says he examined neighborhoods long troubled by destitution yet ripe with beauty and possibility. ""I want to show the complexity of the place. ... It has a lot of hidden richness that maybe has been overlooked,"" Traub said. For example? Start with the ubiquitous churches, some recently converted from commercial buildings. Others, as he writes in the book's essay, were ""built in more prosperous times, such as the Church of the Advocate, which played an important role in the Civil Rights era."" ""I was most drawn to those that were smaller and in flux, changing denominations and pastors frequently. They seemed more like local businesses vying to attract congregations,"" he writes. He explored the area from 2008 to 2013, mostly in the first two years when he lived on the edge of North Philadelphia upon his return from China. A large-format camera -- hood over head, with a tripod -- was his tool of choice. ""People thought I was a surveyor or real estate developer,"" Traub said, and asked what he was up to. ""But for the most part, when I told them what I was doing, they were quite open and welcoming -- happy that someone was taking interest in the neighborhood."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Traub's choice of subjects reflected his personal experience in the area. North Philadelphia has both significant African-American and Hispanic populations, but Traub -- of German-Jewish and Chinese heritage -- focused on black residents and neighborhoods. It was in those neighborhoods that his mother, a Chinese-American, started a renewal project that would transform vacant lots into a series of art parks. He helped in the summer and grew close to those he worked with. His mother's roots also drew him to China in the late 1990s. Wanting to explore his Asian heritage, he worked on a photo project examining people who migrated from the countryside to look for opportunity in cities like Beijing. It was a study in contradictions -- cities were newly prosperous, yet the workers remained poor, living on the margins. Traub returned to the United States thinking he'd explore economic divides there. That's not exactly how it turned out, he says. He went to Baltimore and cities in Ohio and elsewhere in the Rust Belt. Something didn't click. He turned to North Philadelphia. Once there, his interests were less about making a social point. ""While I was interested in economic differences and racial divides, I felt there was something more personal for me in the project,"" he said. ""I realized I had some kind of a specific connection in North Philadelphia. I was interested in looking at the place itself, not looking at it as a way to explore broader social issues."" It was a return to a place that grabbed his imagination years ago. ""On one hand it is ignored and in decline, but it also is a place of tremendous possibility and great human resources -- people who are marginalized but also have a tremendous amount to offer,"" he said.

Republicans have kept their focus on Clinton, and they've argued that if the former secretary of state runs, she will become President Barack Obama's third term, not Bill Clinton's. Even some close to Clinton have quietly expressed concern that one of the most effective critiques could be that her presidency, should she run and be elected, would be nothing more than President Barack Obama's third term.

"There is something mirage-like about Kazakhstan's capital Astana. Little surrounds the city for 1,200 kilometers, save a handful of provincial towns dotted across the world's largest steppe, a flat, empty expanse of grassland. Shooting up from this void is a mass of strangely futuristic structures. The newest of these is the Norman Foster-designed Khan Shatyr, a shopping mall that doubles as the world's largest tent. Foster was also the architect behind the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, a 60-meter-tall glass pyramid. There's also the Central Concert Hall, which from above looks like a budding flower, a flying saucer-shaped circus, a presidential palace designed to replicate the White House, and Baiterek, a 100-meter-tall tower that has drawn comparisons to a giant lollipop. Yet just 15 years ago the city didn't really exist at all. In 1997 Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev moved the capital from Almaty in the southeast of the country to the newly-named Astana (previously it was called Akmola), which was then an empty patch of land by the Ishim River best known as a former gulag prison camp for the wives of Soviet traitors. Today the bulging, science fiction-like skyline has started to earn the country some international recognition. Neil Billett, a managing director and partner at Buro Happold, the engineering consultants that partnered with Foster's firm on the Khan Shatyr and the Palace of Peace, lauds the local architects' progressive thinking. ""They do quite like a challenge, and they do organize themselves to get on with it in a way that's quite refreshing,"" he says. ""These projects would have taxed the mind of many a high-end contractor, and in Kazakhstan, they have to address the same problems in a much harder climate."" Send in your photos from Kazakhstan . The capital's climate does make construction much more complicated. In the winter months temperatures can fall to minus 40 degrees Celsius (minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit), making it the second coldest capital city in the world. In the summer, the mercury can reach up to 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). According to George Keliris, a structural engineer at Buro Happold, this temperature variance proved particularly challenging when constructing the Palace of Peace. ""We had to allow a system that relieved the stress and let the structure breathe,"" he says. The solution they came up with was to lock down one corner of the pyramid, while placing the remaining corners on bridge bearings. Though common with bridges, such bearings are practically unheard of with entire buildings. ""Basically, it's on roller skates,"" says Keliris. ""Because of the climate, (the structure) was bound to be futuristic."" From a distance, Astana's architecture looks disparate, however a strong Kazakh theme runs through it all. Baiterek is meant to evoke the local legend of the ""Tree of Life""; the story has a golden egg, and the building is topped with a golden orb. The shape of the Central Concert Hall was purposefully made to resemble a traditional Kazakh instrument, known as a dombra. Since it became the country's capital, Astana's population has more than doubled to 750,000. Despite this urban growth the size of the new buildings can still seem excessively large. The Central Concert Hall is one of the largest in the world, and seats 3,500 spectators, while the Astana Arena seats 30,000. However, according to Serik Rustambekov, a local architect, the reach of these projects matches the local way of thinking. ""You need to understand the Kazakh background to get a better picture of our world view. We're a nomadic civilization that developed over thousands of years in the vast expanse of Eurasia. Free space is more impressive to the Kazakh mindset than the type of congestion found in many European centers."" Numerous architects from across the world have had a hand in shaping the new capital's skyline, but the one man who has had the greatest impact in the city's transformation is President Nazarbayev. Manfredi Nicoletti, whose Rome-based firm, Studio Nicoletti, designed the Central Concert Hall, confirms that Nazarbayev was very hands-on in the structure's implementation. ""He used to joke that the building was right in front of his residence (the Presidential Palace), and that the project's construction site -- and us, of course -- were always under his control."" In many ways, Astana looks like a vanity project for Nazarbayev. At the top of Baiterek, which grew from a sketch Nazarbayev did himself, visitors can touch his gilded handprint, and each year, the city's anniversary celebrations happen to coincide with his birthday. Nazarbayev's advocates, however, argue that Astana isn't a symbol of his ego, so much as his ambition for the Kazakh nation. One of Nazarbayev's strongest supporters has come in the unlikely form of Jonathan Aitken, a former British politician, who wrote a recently published biography of the president based on 23 hours of personal interview, and a retrospective of the country. ""While I'm sure (Nazarbayev) does have a large ego, it's more of an 'I love the country'-centred ego, not an I-centred ego,"" says Aitken. Aitken equates Nazarbeyev with the type of patrons that dominated 18th century Europe, in particular, Louis XIV. ""Just as Versailles and parts of Paris were all created by one man's vision, so too was Astana,"" he says. The city's futuristic design shows Kazakhstan's ambition and desire to distance itself from the Soviet legacy that has marred many of the surrounding Central Asian nations. ""Architecture always represents the development of the state, of technology and of culture,"" notes Rustambekov. ""As Astana is positioning itself as the center of Eurasia, a place where East meets West, a mixture of styles is quite appropriate.""","Astana became capital of Kazakhstan in 1997 .
City is becoming known for striking modern architecture .

"House Republican leaders were forced on Thursday to delay rolling out their bill to raise the nation's debt limit, after conservatives complained the package failed to include deep enough budget cuts and significant changes to entitlement programs. Boehner signals GOP focus now on debt ceiling . The setback comes as Speaker John Boehner prepares to wrestle with his conference over how to ultimately handle short term spending and the prospect of a government shutdown beginning on Tuesday, if Congress does not act to refill federal coffers. Boehner and his top lieutenants initially hoped to move ahead with their proposal to permit Washington to borrow more money to pay its bills while waiting for the Senate to vote on a plan -- called a continuing resolution -- to keep the government funded through mid-November. The debt package includes a lengthy list of GOP priorities, including a one year delay of Obamacare, provisions to roll back regulations on businesses, tax reforms, and approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. But the added items have not garnered enough support from House Republicans. ""It definitely has a lot of goodies in it. Things that arguably would grow the economy and would arguably would generate more revenue,"" Alabama Republican Rep Mo Brooks told reporters, saying he was undecided on how he would vote on the plan. But he added that the issue of government spending overall must be considered. ""Washington has a spending problem and this debt ceiling bill does not address the problem,"" Brooks said. Rep. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CNN that she was also undecided but wanted to see deeper budget cuts on the measure. ""I came here to cut spending and to reduce the size of the federal government so when those opportunities arise I want to take advantage of them,"" Lummis said. Some House Republicans questioned the strategy of skipping ahead to the debt ceiling fight before Congress resolved the question on spending and the possible shutdown. They argued the GOP still had some leverage to force a change to Obamacare on that measure. ""I think we need to focus on the CR first.  I think it's important that we complete that before we move onto the debt ceiling,"" Minnesota Republican Michele Bachmann said outside the House floor. The draft plan GOP leaders had been working on was really a collection of bills previously approved by the Republican-controlled House. Leaders learned from the last bruising fight in 2011 over the debt limit that a bloc of conservatives would resist any legislation to authorize new borrowing by the Treasury, so they decided to attach sweeteners. Kansas Republican Rep Tim Huelskamp complained the GOP plan fell short of Boehner's pledge to demand an equal amount of spending cuts for the amount of the increase in new borrowing authority. He also said it contained ""very little"" in the way of changes to entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid for the elderly and poor. When asked early on Thursday about the scope of cuts, Boehner told reporters that ""in this bill, we have spending cuts and we have issues that will help spur more economic growth.  We think the balance is correct."" House Republican leaders likely will need to modify the package. They need a unified conference because House Democrats won't vote for it, insisting the House should pass an extension of the debt limit without any conditions. Senate Democrats mocked the proposal. ""The House is attaching the Republican Party platform to the debt ceiling. In a week full of absurdities, this takes the cake,"" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said in a written statement. At an event in Maryland on Thursday, President Barack Obama reiterated that he would not negotiate over the debt ceiling. As Boehner works to corral his own members on the debt limit vote he also needs to beat the clock to avoid a government shutdown. Senate Democrats are scheduled to vote Friday on the House GOP passed spending bill and are expected to strip out the provision that defunds Obamacare. Boehner indicated on Thursday that House Republicans will modify that bill and kick it back to the Senate as the clock ticks down toward the deadline. The speaker dodged questions on what specifically House GOP would tack on, but he downplayed that this move - with so little time remaining - would increase the chances of a possible shutdown. ""We have no interest is seeing a government shutdown, but we've got to address the spending problems that we have in this town and so there will be options available to us. There's not going to be any speculation about what we're going to do or not do until the Senate passes their bill,"" Boehner told reporters on Capitol Hill. Multiple House GOP aides and members have told CNN that there are no final decisions, but the House could add a one year delay of the Obamacare requirement that all individuals enroll in health care coverage. The administration already allowed a one year delay for corporations to provide coverage. Another possible option, one most GOP aides believe could be used, is to add a provision that repeals a tax imposed on medical device manufacturers that helps pay for part of the costs of the new health care law. On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called the medical device tax a ""stupid tax,"" but told reporters he doesn't want to deal with it as part of the stopgap spending bill. Later, a Reid spokesman clarified that the Nevada Democrat was referring not to the tax itself, but to the idea of attaching that provision to the spending bill, saying the House should pass a ""clean"" spending measure. Another option under consideration is adding a provision to the spending bill that repeals federal support for health care premiums that the government covers for members of Congress and their aides. Under the Affordable Care Act, which is set to take effect in the states on Tuesday, members and their aides would obtain coverage under the new health care exchanges and the government, as their employer, would cover a major portion of that premium. Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Charlie Dent told reporters he could support a so-called ""clean"" spending bill that continues funding, but warned ""if there's going to be a relaunch it should be something that the Senate will accept before October 1st."" Boehner pushed back on the notion that continued back and forth over the measure only increases the chances of a shutdown. Though he said, ""I do not expect that to happen.""","House speaker had hoped to roll out proposal to raise U.S. debt limit on Friday .
Conservatives complain package doesn't adequately address spending cuts, entitlements .
Wrangling over temporary spending bill needed to avert shutdown still raging in Congress .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Did a Russian fire the missile that downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17? That depends on who you ask. A top Ukrainian official says he has no doubt. Vitaly Nayda, Ukraine's director of informational security, told CNN the person who shot down the flight was ""absolutely"" a Russian. ""A Russian-trained, well-equipped, well-educated officer ... pushed that button deliberately,"" he said. ""We taped conversations"" between a Russian officer and his office in Moscow, Nayda said. ""We know for sure that several minutes before the missile was launched, there was a report"" to a Russian officer that the plane was coming, he said. ""They knew the plane was coming with constant speed, in constant direction,"" and should have known it was not a fighter jet but ""a big civilian plane,"" he said. U.S. officials say pro-Russian rebels were responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, but they now believe it's likely the rebels didn't know the plane was a commercial airliner when they opened fire, U.S. intelligence officials said Tuesday. The officials have determined that Russia bears some responsibility for the incident because of its support for the rebels, but they haven't been able to determine exactly who fired the missile, whether Russian military were at the site or whether the Russians were directly responsible for launching the missile. Moscow has denied claims that it pulled the trigger. And Russian Army Lt. Gen. Andrei Kartapolov suggested a Ukrainian jet fighter may have shot the plane down. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko rejected that in an exclusive interview with CNN, saying that all Ukrainian aircraft were on the ground at the time. Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, was asked Monday about different intercepted recordings, purportedly of pro-Russian rebels talking about shooting down a plane. Churkin suggested that if they did, it was an accident. ""According to them, the people from the east were saying that they shot down a military jet,"" he said. ""If they think they shot down a military jet, it was confusion. If it was confusion, it was not an act of terrorism."" Pro-Russian rebels have repeatedly denied responsibility for the attack. At crash site, an eerie calm . Now that rebels have handed over the black boxes and the bodies of victims killed when Flight 17 went down, the crash site in eastern Ukraine was eerily quiet on Tuesday, a spokesman for observers in the area said. There were no more local emergency workers or teams combing the wreckage -- even though Dutch officials said they weren't sure whether the remains of all the victims had been recovered. ""They had even taken down the tents,"" said Michael Buciurkiew, spokesman for the monitoring mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. ""There was no activity whatsoever. ... We had an internal discussion today on whether to say it's already trending towards a cleanup operation. There's no active recovery of remains going on right now."" As investigators arrive at the scene, it's unclear what evidence they'll find. Before activity died down at the site, Buciurkiew said, observers saw emergency workers moving around wreckage. ""Major pieces of the fuselage have been moved,"" he said. At one point, he said, observers witnessed teams at the scene ""taking out diesel-powered saws and sawing quite invasively into the cockpit."" Dutch PM: Identifying bodies could take months . A train carrying the remains of crash victims arrived in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Tuesday. Investigators were going through the train cars and transferring bodies to a factory, where a facility was set up to transfer them to coffins and get them on a military plane to the Netherlands for forensic investigation. But officials offered conflicting reports about how many bodies were on the train, with a top Dutch official expressing concern that the remains of more victims could still be at the crash site. Malaysian official Mohd Sakri, who traveled on the train with the remains, said there were 282 corpses and 87 body parts aboard -- the same tally Ukrainian officials earlier gave to describe the remains recovered from the crash site. But Dutch investigators only confirmed there were at least 200 bodies transported from the crash site, Jan Tuinder, head of the Dutch delegation, told reporters. Another Dutch official said investigators were still going through the train cars and it was possible all the crash victims were on the train. There were 298 people aboard the plane when it crashed. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he expects the first plane carrying the remains to arrive Wednesday in Eindhoven. As soon as the remains are identified, families of the victims will be informed. In some cases, that could happen quickly, Rutte said, but in other cases, identification could take weeks or even months. Frans Timmermans, the Dutch foreign minister, said bringing the victims' remains home is his country's top priority. ""To my dying day, I will not understand that it took so much time for the rescue workers to be allowed to do their difficult jobs,"" he told the U.N. Security Council on Monday, ""and that human remains should be used in a political game."" What's next in the investigation? Ukrainian rebels handed over the so-called black boxes Tuesday after what Malaysian officials said were repeated attempts to negotiate with the rebels. ""In recent days, we have been working behind the scenes to establish contact with those in charge of the MH17 crash site,"" Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Monday. But the handover is only the beginning. British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted that Britain agreed to a Dutch request for accident investigators at Farnborough, southwest of London, to retrieve data from the boxes for international analysis. And the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said one of its experts will help retrieve information from the black boxes. The voice recorder could include audio from the cockpit, which would show whether the pilots knew the plane had been hit, said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. And the flight data recorders will give investigators information about engine settings, pressurization and electronic communications, among other details, she said. But even the black boxes might not answer the two most pressing questions: who shot down the plane and why. U.S. and other officials have said it appears the plane was shot down by a sophisticated surface-to-air missile in rebel-held territory. Evidence supporting that conclusion includes telephone intercepts and video of a Buk missile launcher traveling into Russia with at least one missile missing. U.S. President Barack Obama, Cameron and others have said the pro-Russian rebels could not have shot down such a high-flying jet without weapons and training from Russia. Obama called on Russia to rein in the rebel fighters, who he said had treated remains poorly and removed evidence from the site. ""What exactly are they trying to hide?"" he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that his country would use its influence with Ukrainian rebels to push for a full investigation, the Reuters news agency reported. But those assurances did little to stem efforts to crack down on the rebels and their supporters. The European Union's Foreign Affairs Council agreed Tuesday to establish a new list of entitles and individuals, including some from Russia, to face EU sanctions. Timmermans said the Netherlands would seek sanctions involving various fields, including defense, high technology, the energy sector and financial services. A brawl broke out Tuesday in Ukraine's parliament, where fighting takes place frequently, as lawmakers voted to increase the number of troops battling pro-Russian rebels. Nikolai Levchenko, who is from the Donetsk region and has been noticed at separatist rallies, accused the government of killing its own people. A nationalist lawmaker then ran up to him. Soon many lawmakers swarmed around them, with some apparently trying to break up the fight. Ukraine opens criminal case . The U.S. government has released a map of what it says was the flight's path and the site from which the missile was fired. It also released images that it said showed a weapons buildup at a Russian training facility near the Ukraine border. As Ukraine ratcheted up accusations that Moscow was involved in downing the plane, it also opened criminal cases against Russia's defense minister and a Russian businessman, calling both ""accomplices of terrorists."" The Ukrainian Internal Affairs Ministry accused Russian Defense Minister Gen. Sergei Shoigu of helping form ""illegal military groups"" in the Donetsk region, where pro-Russian rebels have declared their own government. ""The illegal military groups, which are led by citizens of the Russian Federation, make regular attacks on government institutions and other organizations that have led to multiple human deaths, destruction and other consequences,"" the ministry said in a statement. And the ministry accused Russian billionaire Konstantin Malofeev of financing the ""illegal military units."" Russian officials have repeatedly denied involvement in fomenting violence in the region. A June profile on Malofeev by Bloomberg News noted that the ""self-proclaimed head of the unrecognized Donetsk People's Republic and its rebel army leader have both worked for Malofeev, though the financier denies any role in the unrest."" Earlier this month, Ukraine opened a criminal case against the head of Russia's Border Service.

"Four years ago an unknown startup called MakerBot showed up at the South by Southwest Interactive conference here with a prototype of its first desktop 3-D printer, which spit out plastic replicas of small objects. Bre Pettis, the company's co-founder, took the machine around to Austin's watering holes, set it on the bar and showed off its capabilities by printing shot glasses. ""They were pretty popular,"" he said. On Friday, Pettis was back at SXSW, this time as a keynote speaker before a packed hall of 3,000 people, further evidence that 3-D printing is a hot trend in the tech world. Once again, he brought a new prototype with him. This time MakerBot unveiled a desktop device that can scan small three-dimensional objects. Called a MakerBot Digitizer, it's meant to complement the company's Replicator printer by letting customers scan objects, then feed the resulting digital files to the Replicator to be printed. The Digitizer uses two lasers and a webcam to scan objects up to about 8 inches in diameter (Pettis brought a small plastic garden gnome as an example.) The process takes less than three minutes. Once the digital scan is completed, an object can be printed right away. It's easier and faster than using software to design a digital printing model from scratch. ""This is something you would envision being science fiction, but in fact, it is real -- and it is so cool,"" said Pettis, who described the Digitizer as a great tool for archiving or replicating prototypes, models, parts, artifacts, sculptures and other objects ""If something gets broken, you can just scan it and print it again."" He said the scanner will hit the market this fall. Pettis did not say how much it would cost, although if the price is comparable to MakerBot's printers -- $2,000 to $3,000 -- it'll be within reach of most small-business owners. The process of 3-D printing uses computer-created digital models to create real-world objects -- everything from simple toys or jewelry to more complex objects with moving parts. The printers follow the shape of the model by stacking layer upon layer of molten plastic to produce the items. The emerging 3-D printing industry got a boost last month when President Obama highlighted it in his State of the Union address as something that could revive manufacturing and fuel new high-tech jobs in the United States. The New York-based MakerBot has emerged as a pioneer in the burgeoning field by making home 3-D printing relatively affordable.  Pettis, who was splashed on the cover of Wired magazine last year, has become the industry's poster boy. ""I think we can safely say that if there is a 3-D printing revolution, he is the commander in chief,"" said SXSW Interactive Director Hugh Forrest in introducing Pettis, MakerBot's CEO, on Friday. In his remarks, Pettis said he has been excited to see the many ways people have used 3-D printers to enhance their lives. He showed a slide of a boy in South Africa, born without fingers on his right hand, who received a low-cost prosthetic made by a 3-D printer. ""There's a renaissance going on (in 3-D printing) now. It's never been easier to make and share things,"" he said. ""You can fill the world with garden gnomes if you want."" Somebody in the audience asked Pettis if 3-D printers will someday be able to print any object you could possibly need. ""Yes, eventually,"" he said. ""There are some limitations (now),"" he added, citing MakerBot's messy attempts to print food, such as chocolate. MakerBot's announcement of its Digitizer scanner is an unusual occurrence at SXSW Interactive, which is typically known for launching apps and social media tools, not hardware. But the small but growing company -- Pettis said he's looking to hire 50 people -- is already becoming a role model for other startups. ""As an entrepreneur you have to believe that it's possible (to succeed),"" he said in response to a question from an audience member. ""One of the reasons MakerBot worked is that we didn't know how hard it was going to be.""","Startup MakerBot on Friday unveils a desktop device that can scan small 3-D objects .

"So NBC has signed Bill Cosby for a new sitcom. The 76-year-old comedian is slated to play the patriarch of a multigenerational family, NBC told CNN on Wednesday. Bill Cosby to return to NBC in new sitcom . A network representative did not elaborate on anything else involving the show. No doubt, NBC is hoping this version of Cos brings back memories of his eight-year run as the gruff but warmhearted Dr. Cliff Huxtable on ""The Cosby Show"" -- and not the failed gumshoe of ""The Cosby Mysteries,"" which lasted one season in 1994-95, or the cranky retiree of ""Cosby"" (1996-2000), which started out strong but sank quickly in the ratings. The return of Cosby coincides with other figures from the '80s and early '90s making their return to prime time in one way or another. Michael J. Fox has been heading a clan on ""The Michael J. Fox Show"" since September, and Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos are reuniting for a yogurt commercial to air during the Super Bowl. (No word on whether the Olsen twins will be in tow.) ""Full House"" stars reunite for Super Bowl . But nostalgia and Q scores -- those popularity measuring sticks marketers love so much -- only go so far. Sure, Cosby is a popular guy. People still have warm feelings about the comedian, even if it's been ages since he was TV's most popular pitchman. (Don't laugh -- the man's in the Advertising Hall of Fame.) And ""The Cosby Show"" was a landmark in TV sitcoms, not only showcasing a bright African-American family but leading the ratings for five straight years in the 1980s. NBC began more than a decade of dominance thanks to ""Cosby's"" success. ""Bill Cosby is always going to be welcomed into people's homes because of nostalgia for the Huxtables,"" says Amanda McClain, a communications professor at Holy Family University in Philadelphia. The trick, however, is the show he'll be placed in. ""A famous name is itself no guarantee,"" wrote Time's James Poniewozik, observing that Fox's show has suffered because it's depended too heavily on memories of the lead instead of making his show interesting. ""Bill Cosby, like the Jell-O he once pitched, remains a beloved brand. But if his show makes it to air, the proof will be not in the brand but in the pudding."" 'Television isn't very reflective of reality' So what might a new Cosby sitcom look like? Probably something like America -- whatever that is these days. After all, TV families have always reflected our culture, even if they've sometimes been a year or two behind the times. In the 1950s, ""Father Knows Best"" showed off a happy nuclear family in Springfield, USA. In the 1960s, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" offered a Kennedyesque household in suburban New York. The 1970s included ""The Brady Bunch,"" about a blended clan for a time in which divorce and second marriages were becoming commonplace. (However, divorce was still stigmatized enough that it was never revealed whether Carol Brady was a widow or a divorcee.) In the wake of ""All in the Family"" and producer Norman Lear's other edgy shows, 1970s TV families took on the broader appearance of society. ""Good Times"" was set in a Chicago housing project; ""One Day at a Time"" featured a single-mother household in Indianapolis. But TV is also nothing if not aspirational, says McClain, and Lear's unflinching sitcoms -- exceptional even in their time -- were swept aside in the 1980s. ""Television isn't very reflective of reality,"" she says. ""There's underrepresentation of people of color, underrepresentation of many different types of people. Still today, there are very few Asian-American or Latino people on television."" Even ""The Cosby Show,"" with its upper-class doctor and lawyer living in Brooklyn Heights, was often more aspirational than realistic, she says. Viewers, however, apparently like aspirational. Since the '80s, the dominant family shows have been ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Family Ties,"" ""Home Improvement"" and ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" ""Two and a Half Men"" and ""Modern Family."" Some have unusual family structures -- ""Modern Family,"" famously, includes a gay couple, an old-young husband-wife combination and several stepchildren -- but they generally feature white clans and take place in well-off circumstances. Though there have been several sitcoms featuring people of color or folks in working-class circumstances, about the only breakout exception has been ""Roseanne,"" Roseanne Barr's early '90s hit, which regularly reflected genuine working-class circumstances. ""Compared to like the '70s, where you had true diversity -- 'Sanford & Son' and 'Good Times,' people of all walks of life, jobs and bank accounts -- today it's as if we've regressed in some ways,"" says John Griffiths, president of the Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association and TV critic for Us Weekly. He suggests one reason might be because Hollywood is somewhat insular. ""The networks try really hard at having diverse sitcom writing staffs, but there's still an issue with a lot of white guys who maybe went to Harvard and live on the west side of L.A. who write these shows,"" he says. Next step: Senior citizens? There have been some attempts to change the view on broadcast television, he points out, though new styles have struggled to catch on. ""The New Normal,"" which featured a same-sex couple and their relationship with a surrogate and her family, was canceled after one season; ""The Middle,"" about a middle-class family in Indiana, has plodded along, ""underrated,"" in Griffiths' opinion. Cable television, which has the luxury of targeting its ""reality"" shows -- many of which are simply sitcoms in different guise -- at specific demographics, has opted for upscale families (""Keeping Up With the Kardashians""), heartland groups (""Duck Dynasty"") or a mix of flavors (""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo""). Families come in many forms on television, of course -- what was ""Friends"" if not about a family of sorts? -- and the next wave may include more senior citizens. With baby boomers starting to take care of aging parents and being called ""the sandwich generation,"" a Cosby show truly reflecting issues across generations could be a hit, says McClain, the communications professor. Or perhaps a new Cosby show could simply focus on the elderly, Griffiths says. ""The aged are very underrepresented,"" he says. He observes that his group's pick for unsung TV show of the year, HBO's ""Getting On,"" is set in an extended-care unit and includes a closeted homosexual, an African-American nurse and a variety of senior citizens. (HBO is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN.) ""It's almost like a Norman Lear show,"" Griffiths says. A Cosby show need not go that far -- it'll be on NBC, not HBO, after all -- but the lead could make of it what he wants. ""The great thing is that Cosby is at an age where he'll be playing a grandfather,"" Griffiths says. All you need is one successful show to start a trend, and if a wider range of ages is shown on a TV show, it could lead to others. After all, the ultimate family show -- even in these days of DVRs and second screens -- is watching TV, McClain says. ""Television is a family event,"" she says. ""Families watch television together.""","Bill Cosby is set to star in a new NBC sitcom .

"Last week, a hunter stunned the world by paying $350,000 to kill a black rhino. The deal went went viral and brought death threats against the hunter. And that was just people trying to protect one endangered rhino. Imagine more than 1,000. That is how many poachers in South Africa killed last year, authorities said, a harrowing record for the nation with the world's largest  population of the animals. As demand for the horn soars in China and Vietnam, so does the number of rhinos slaughtered. In Asia, some believe the horn can cure ills such as cancer, diabetes and hangovers. The 2013 record in South Africa is almost double the year before. Last year, 1,004 rhinos were illegally killed in the nation compared with 668 the previous year, the environmental affairs ministry said in a statement. Most of the poaching occurred in  Kruger National Park. South Africa is home to both white and black rhinos. Conservation group Save the Rhino estimates there are 25,000 African rhinos left worldwide, a majority of them in in the nation. The black rhino is critically endangered, and conservationists are fiercely protective of it. Hunter Corey Knowlton is the U.S. hunter who's now become the hunted. Last week, he paid $350,000 at the Dallas Safari Club's auction for a permit  to hunt a black rhino in the southern African nation of Namibia. Even though he said the money would go toward conservation, death threats against him escalated, forcing him to get extra security. Knowlton stepped into a passionate debate. Organized crime syndicates are using military-grade helicopters, night-vision equipment and guns fitted with silencers, taking rhino poaching to a whole new level and leaving conservationists struggling to keep up. Kenya and South Africa have invested in unmanned drones, sniffer dogs and increased security. Despite stepped up efforts, they have failed to halt the rising tide of rhino slaughter. Experts say the rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs. A kilogram fetches about $20,000 --  with a single horn weighing about 10 kilograms (22 pounds).","Poachers killed more than 1,000 rhinos for their horns last year in South Africa .

"Northern Nigeria (CNN)Charred ground and cinders mark the sites where once thousands of homes stood. That's according to a series of satellite images released Thursday by Amnesty International, which the rights group said shows the ""horrific scale"" of the devastation wrought by Boko Haram militants. As they've trickled out, accounts of the bloody attacks on the northern Nigerian town of Baga and surrounding villages have shocked even those all too used to reports of violence by Boko Haram militants. Witnesses told how the attackers sped into the town on January 3 with grenade launchers -- their gunfire and explosions shattering the early morning calm. Some terrified residents fled, while others took refuge in their homes -- and were torched with them. Local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as 2,000 people. But authorities have yet to access the remote area near the border with Chad to get a full picture. Amnesty International said that satellite images taken on January 2 and five days later ""provide indisputable and shocking evidence"" of the extent of the destruction in Baga and neighboring village of Doron Baga, also known as Doro Gowon. The before-and-after images demonstrate that the attacks left more than 3,700 structures damaged or destroyed, the rights group said. More than 3,100 of those were in Doron Baga, which was ""nearly wiped off the map,"" it said. Other nearby towns and villages in Borno state were also targeted in the series of attacks that started on January 3. ""These detailed images show devastation of catastrophic proportions in two towns, one of which was almost wiped off the map in the space of four days,"" said Daniel Eyre, Nigeria researcher for Amnesty International. ""Of all Boko Haram assaults analysed by Amnesty International, this is the largest and most destructive yet. It represents a deliberate attack on civilians whose homes, clinics and schools are now burnt out ruins."" Many of the wooden fishing boats that can be seen along the shoreline in the images of Doron Baga from January 2 are gone in the later images, the group said. This agrees with witness accounts of desperate residents fleeing by boat across Lake Chad. Another rights group, Human Rights Watch, has also published satellite imagery that it said showed the results of fires set by Boko Haram. The rights group said 11% of Baga and 57% of Doro Gowon were scarred by the flames. Asked by CNN about the Amnesty satellite images, Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Center, said, ""This is a government that analyzes any and all sources of information."" Amnesty International last week described the massacre as possibly Boko Haram's ""deadliest act"" yet. The Nigerian military said that description was ""quite valid."" ""The attack on the town by the bloodhounds and their activities since January 3 should convince well meaning people all over the world that Boko Haram is the evil all must collaborate to end,"" it said. Nigeria's government has called for Boko Haram to be seen as a problem requiring a concerted international response, as seen after the terrorist attacks in Paris last week. On Wednesday, a new message surfaced from Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, in which he praised again and again the deadly rampage at the Charlie Hebdo offices in France. ""Nigeria has always said this is a global challenge and viewed as such requires global military action,"" said Omeri. ""The combatants we capture are often not even Nigerian. They don't even speak our languages. What started as copycat attacks is now a newly devised network."" The government has come under fire from critics who say President Goodluck Jonathan is more interested in campaigning for the presidential election next month than in dealing with the problem of Boko Haram. Soldiers who spoke to CNN in northern Nigeria painted a troubling picture when asked about their efforts to take on the Islamist extremist group. They said Boko Haram outgunned and outnumbered the military on the battlefield. While the militants are equipped with anti-aircraft guns on the backs of trucks that have a range of three-quarters of a mile, they have only AK-47 weapons, with a range of a few hundred yards, the soldiers said. Adding to their difficulties, they are issued only 60 bullets when they go into battle, they said, while the Boko Haram fighters have many more. Many soldiers also have to buy their own uniforms and lack protective gear, they said. Morale is low, and this is one of the reasons that Boko Haram is making gains on the battlefield, they said. Responding to the claims that the military is outgunned, Omeri said: ""Nigeria is in the process of acquiring new equipment and we will continue to intensify those efforts."" In a rare piece of good news, Nigerian soldiers thwarted a Boko Haram attack Wednesday in the town of Biu, in southern Borno state, the military said. The Nigerian Defense Headquarters said five terrorists and two anti-aircraft guns were captured. Officials gave no casualty tolls, but residents told CNN that at least 40 Boko Haram fighters were killed when Nigerian soldiers surprised them and fought a lengthy gun battle. Omeri said, ""We've always said this is an ongoing process. We're happy that this success has come in quick succession to Baga. We hope more will be achieved."" The continuing violence has displaced many people from their homes. Of the 30,000 people displaced during the attacks around Baga, 20,000 camped in Maiduguri city, capital of Borno state, while another 10,000 headed to Monguno town, nearer Baga. Others were stranded on Kangala Island on Lake Chad. ""These people are adding to the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people and refugees, who have already stretched the capacity of host communities and government authorities,"" Amnesty International said. ""Amnesty International is calling on the governments of Nigeria and Chad to ensure these displaced people are protected and provided with adequate humanitarian assistance."" Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. It has also kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in April -- and remain missing. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. CNN's Nic Robertson reported from northern Nigeria, and Laura Smith-Spark reported and wrote from London.

"New York (CNN) -- You could be forgiven for thinking no one cares -- or even should care, right now -- about climate change. For starters, there's all that other terrifying stuff competing for attention: President Barack Obama's war with ISIS; the Ebola outbreak, which recently put Sierra Leone on national lockdown; Ukraine; Scotland; wife-beating athletes. That scary guy in Pennsylvania. The world seems like a pretty big mess right now. The climate? Not top of the agenda. Polls indicate Americans care less about climate change than pretty much anything. Even among those of us who are inclined to care about the planet, there's the holy-crap-I-can't-even-deal-with-it factor. It seems too big, too daunting -- and like so much damage is already being done. But I put those doubts completely to rest on Sunday as I wove through hopeful crowds of thousands at the People's Climate March in New York, which was billed by organizers as the biggest rally against climate change world has ever seen. There was no independent estimate of the size of the crowd immediately available, but organizers said as many as 310,000 people attended -- many from far reaches of the globe, ahead of a UN climate summit here this week. Marchers sound urgent call for climate change action . World leaders are expected to discuss the topic and, hopefully, build momentum for more-concrete climate talks in Paris next year. Climate marches also were held on Sunday in 2,800 other locations, according to organizers, from Paris to Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Related: 'I'm on the front lines of this crisis' In a world disinclined to care about the urgent threat of climate change, these were the people who are both experiencing the crisis -- right now, not 100 years in the future -- and who also believe there's still time to make a difference. ""I am fearful, but for the most part, I'm optimistic,"" said Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, a 26-year-old who came to New York from the Marshall Islands, in the Pacific. Sea level rise already is washing away grave sites and lashing homes on the islands, she said. She came to New York in part to represent her 7-month-old daughter, who she hopes will be able to live on the island, rather than relocate. ""I see this movement and I see this march and I see all these thousands of people coming together for climate change; I believe there are things we can do to change the world. ""I believe it can happen."" It's not possible for her to ignore this issue like the rest of us. ""The thing you have to imagine is the ocean is huge next to our islands,"" she told me. ""Our islands are completely tiny ... You don't get to forget how vulnerable you are."" The march, which wandered along the edge of Central Park and through the streets of Midtown Manhattan, took on the feel of a celebration for a planet that's worth saving rather than a funeral for one already lost. I saw accordions, drums, a giant-dancing-puppet representation of Mother Earth. The mood was a bit surprising considering some climate scientists and policy experts say the world already has acted far too slowly to curb carbon emissions and that we're locked into some level of harmful warming. The atmosphere already has warmed about 1-degree Celsius because of people, said Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, which helped organize the events. ""That's enormous,"" he told me. ""It's been enough already to melt the summer Arctic"" and to increase ocean acidification by 30%. ""As astonishing as those changes are, they are a very small trailer for the horror movie that's coming if we don't act quickly,"" he said. And that's what people here were calling for: Quick, assured action. A reduction in harmful carbon emissions. Real targets, based on science. New, clean industry. A revolution, really -- an economy that looks beyond the fossil era. I met people from China, Tibet, West Virginia, Arizona -- all of whom want the world to act. ""We are here representing the Earth,"" said WhatwenÃ¯ne ""Freida"" Jacques, 64, who moving with the crowd in a motorized wheelchair. ""I really think this should have happened a good 20 years ago."" Jayeesha Dutta, a 36-year-old from New Orleans, marched in New York wearing a Mardi Gras mask and carrying one side of a banner that read, ""The Seas Are Rising and So Are We!"" ""We are at the front lines of climate change,"" she said, echoing a familiar refrain. ""Our communities are going to be the first climate change refugees of our country ... As we lose the land, we're also going to be losing cultures."" Some of the most poignant pleas for action came from people impacted by Superstorm Sandy, which hit New York in October 2012, filling subways with water, displacing coastal residents and killing more than 100 people in the United States as well as more than 60 in the Caribbean and Canada. Hurricanes are expected to continue to get stronger as the climate warms, and locals here fear a repeat tragedy. I met Silaka Cox, 19, from the Rockaways, at the city's edge. It was hit hard by Sandy. If climate change isn't stopped, Cox told me she worries her community, where she still lives even though it means a 1 1/2 hour commute to New York University, where she's a sophomore, might not be viable. ""The sea levels are just going to keep rising if we don't do anything about it,"" she said. And I met Brendan McAvoy, a 21-year old who lost his home in the storm. He came to the rally Sunday with a blue sign simply reading, ""Hope."" The letters were made of sand he collected from the beach in New Jersey. He told me he initially made the sign for his mom, to help get her through the months after the storm. ""That's all you have when the water takes away your house and takes away your family,"" he said, referencing the fact that he attributes his father's death, after the storm, in part to the stress caused by the displacement. ""All you have is hope."" Climate change is a collective tinnitus -- always ringing in the background, but so constant and seemingly incurable that we try to ignore it. That's impossible for McAvoy and the others I met on Sunday. For them, climate change is sounding an alarm far too loud to be silenced. To demonstrate this in the most literal of ways, rally attendees raised their hands in the air in a moment of silence at 12:58 p.m. Then at 1 p.m., they let out a collective yelp. It was so loud and heartfelt it gave me chills. I hope it brought some degree of comfort -- and maybe inspiration -- to all those attending whose lives already are being shaken up by this crisis, which the world should act far more urgently to address. As I heard from many people I met, we have the technology and the popular will to fix this. It's just time for someone in power to listen.","Organizers say more than 300,000 gather in New York for climate rally .

"Decatur, Georgia (CNN) -- A former Georgia sheriff's deputy was found guilty Wednesday of murder in the shooting deaths of his wife and a day laborer. A Dekalb County jury deliberated for about 22 hours before convicting Derrick Yancey, 49, of two counts of malice murder and two counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime in the June 9, 2008, killings of Linda Yancey, 44, and Marcial Cax-Puluc, 23. Yancey was apprehended on Sept. 21, 2009, in Punta Gorda, Belize, where he had fled after escaping house arrest. Defense attorney Ruth McMullin said Yancey shot Cax-Puluc in self-defense after the Guatemalan day laborer shot his wife in a robbery attempt. However, over the course of four days of testimony from almost 40 expert witnesses, neighbors and family members, DeKalb County Prosecutor Don Geary convinced jurors that Yancey instead hatched a plan to shoot his wife in the basement of their Stone Mountain home and then implicate Cax-Puluc, whom he had picked up at a nearby gas station frequented by men looking for day work. Linda Yancey's family listened with little visible reaction to the reading of the verdict. Yancey faces a possible life sentence when is semtenced, which is scheduled to take place over the next several weeks.","Derrick Yancey is convicted of murdering his wife and a day laborer .

"(CNN)Two fraternities at the University of Virginia say they won't sign an agreement dictating new safety procedures after a student's claim of being gang raped. The policy calls for fraternities to have security at doors, guard their stairs, have keys to each room, sober brothers at parties and to eliminate pre-mixed drinks. In November, the university suspended all fraternities and associated parties until this month after a Rolling Stone magazine article about the student's claims. Despite scrutiny of the article's depiction of the alleged rape of a then-UVA freshman, identified in the article as Jackie, the university stuck to its promise to review how sexual assault is handled and to make Greek life safer. UVA gave its fraternity members until Friday to sign the agreement if they wanted to have the suspension lifted. But Alpha Tau Omega and Kappa Alpha Order released statements on their national fraternity letterhead saying they would not do so. They said the university unfairly punished members of Greek life when it uniformly suspended social activities two days after the Rolling Stone article was published, and said they are concerned the demands will create new liability and ""set a dangerous precedent of an erosion of student and organizational rights."" Instead, both fraternities plan to ignore the new rules set by UVA and resume activities. The university said the rules were developed by student groups and said it won't comment until after the Friday deadline for fraternities to sign the agreement has passed. A source familiar with the thinking of the national fraternities said this could result in litigation if UVA tries to limit the fraternities that won't sign the new agreement. The Washington Post reports that Phi Kappa Psi is one of the fraternities that signed the agreement and remains committed to improving safety during events. Jackie told Rolling Stone that she was assaulted by seven men at  a Phi Kappa Psi party. In the weeks that followed the article, the Washington Post and other news organizations began scrutinizing the details of Jackie's story. CNN spoke to Jackie's friends, who told a different version of events from that night, and Phi Kappa Psi produced records that seemed to dispute what she said happened. Charlottesville Police investigated after the story was printed, and said earlier this week that police found no ""substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article occurred at Phi Kappa Psi."" Police have not said whether they believe Jackie was raped. Rolling Stone apologized and launched an investigation of its own. The magazine editor acknowledged that the writer never contacted some of the witnesses or any of the accused.","In Rolling Stone article, student says she was gang raped at fraternity .

"One of the three Drug Enforcement Administration agents under investigation for allegedly soliciting sex in Cartagena, Colombia, had a long-term relationship with a prostitute, potentially exposing himself to blackmail by drug cartels or other criminals, according to two government sources familiar with the investigation. Investigators at the Department of Justice and the DEA are trying to determine if that woman was aware that the man she had multiple liaisons with was stationed by the DEA in her drug-torn country.  Officials have tried to interview her -- even compelling the agent to get her on the phone -- but have not been able to talk to her yet, the sources said. ""The reason this is troubling is that these women are really unknown to our law enforcement personnel,"" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is investigating the use of prostitutes by Secret Service agents in Colombia before President Barack Obama's visit there last month. ""We don't know if they are associated with drug cartels.  Whether they have been sent into entrap the agents or compromise them in some way which could endanger their mission -- whether it's protecting the president in the case of the Secret Service agents, or whether it's pursuing drug activities in the case of the DEA agents."" The DEA agents were not involved in the security for the president's trip, the government sources said. The DEA agent's relationship with the prostitute came to light after a Secret Service agent voluntarily reported to his superiors that he was at a party at the agents' Cartagena apartment on April 13 with the three DEA agents and several women, according to the government sources.  One of the sources said the Secret Service agent reported that he went into a bedroom with one of the women and had ""a massage with a sexual aspect to it."" Later, the Secret Service agent witnessed the women he was with being paid in local currency by one of the DEA agents, the sources said.  But the Secret Service agent has insisted to investigators that it was not his intention to pay for sex. ""Because of all the pressure, he wanted to self-report and basically confess that this had occurred instead of getting caught,"" said a government source who described the Secret Service agent as ""guilt-ridden."" The Secret Service agent is the 13th agency employee to get caught up in the Colombia prostitution scandal. He is currently on administrative leave but is not expected to lose his job because he came forward on his own to report the incident, according to several sources. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King, R-New York, told CNN the Secret Service agent took and passed a polygraph test.  But he said the alleged behavior by the DEA agents puts lives at risk. King said any time U.S government personnel are ""involved in any sexual manner...you are leaving yourself, at the very least, you're opening yourself to blackmail. Secondly in these countries like Colombia or the old Soviet bloc, you run the risk (of people) being recruited to get something on you or to drug you to get information from you, to compromise you, to kidnap you."" The Colombia scandal will be the subject of a hearing Wednesday before Sen. Collins' committee. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan will testify at the hearing in his first public appearance before Congress about the incident. In remarks prepared for delivery as her opening statement at the hearing, Collins says, ""This reckless behavior could easily have compromised individuals charged with the security of the president of the United States."" She adds, ""The facts so far lead me to conclude that, while not at all representative of the majority of Secret Service personnel, this misconduct was almost certainly not an isolated incident.""","Sources cite potential for agents being blackmailed by drug cartels or other criminals .

"(CNN)We have all seen a great deal of hypocrisy from politicians, pundits and the like. But there's a new king of hypocrisy: al Qaeda. On Wednesday, al Qaeda released a video featuring Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi, one of its top commanders in Yemen, claiming responsibility for the horrific attack last week on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. He gave two reasons for the attack. First, he claimed it was in revenge for Charlie Hebdo's printing of cartoons lampooning the Prophet Mohammed. Al-Ansi then went on to state in much greater detail that the attack was in response to France and the West killing Muslims: ""We will tell you once again ... stop spilling our blood."" And then he urged Muslims across the world to ""take vengeance for Muslim blood spilled."" Well, if spilling Muslim blood is the deciding factor for us Muslims to decide who we should take vengeance against, then al-Ansi and others in al Qaeda should immediately go into hiding. Simply put, al Qaeda has been slaughtering Muslims for years. Islamic clerics, doctors, nurses, women, children, etc. -- you name any type of Muslim, and al Qaeda has butchered them. In fact, a report released in 2009 by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point documented the people killed by al Qaeda between 2004 and 2008. It found that only 12% of the victims of al Qaeda were Westerners. That suggests that al Qaeda has killed seven times as many Muslims as non-Muslims. And these attacks were just the ones for which al Qaeda had publicly claimed responsibility. And since that report, al Qaeda in Yemen has engaged in even more vicious attacks on Muslims. Keep in mind that 99% of the population of Yemen is Muslim (65% Sunni and 35% Shia) so with a few exceptions, virtually every person the group kills there is a Muslim. In December 2014, for example, an al Qaeda bomb killed 15 children and 10 adults when the bus they were on was blown up by an al Qaeda car bomb intended for a competing militia leader in the area. This attack followed another in which al Qaeda sent a suicide bomber into a crowd of protesters in the nation's capital, killing 47 people and injuring 140. And back in December 2013, al Qaeda launched an attack on a hospital, killing 52 people and wounding 167 with two car bombs before gruesomely shooting patients and doctors in the hospital. The list goes on, but al Qaeda is not alone in killing Muslims who stand in its way. ISIS has done the same in Iraq and Syria. A U.N. report released late last year found that ISIS had killed thousands of Muslims -- both Sunni and Shia -- between July and September of that year. This includes the slayings of three nurses in Mosul, Iraq, because they refused to provide medical care to ISIS fighters. ISIS also killed numerous Sunni imams for refusing to swear allegiance to ISIS, and beheaded another Sunni leader for refusing to support the group. And the reality is that that's truly what al Qaeda and ISIS are about. They are not about the concept of ""submit to Islam or die,"" as some have claimed. It's submit to ISIS/al Qaeda or die. Both organizations clearly don't care how many Muslims they kill. Yet at the same time they will both claim they are carrying out their actions in the name of Islam. In fact, al-Ansi stated in Wednesday's video that the terrorist brothers who carried out the attack on the Charlie Hebdo officers were ""two heroes of Islam."" He couldn't be more wrong. But that isn't to say there weren't heroes of Islam in Paris that day -- it's just that they are two quite different people. Ahmed Merabet was the French police officer shot in cold blood while lying on the sidewalk by the so-called ""heroes of Islam."" As his brother stated at a press conference, Merabet was a proud Muslim who gave his life defending French values of ""liberty, equality and fraternity."" And there was Lassana Bathily, the Muslim employee at the kosher deli in Paris who reportedly saved the lives of seven Jewish patrons by helping them hide when Amedy Coulibaly entered the store with guns blazing. Bathily's actions exemplified the famous Quranic verse, ""Whoever saves one -- it is as if he had saved mankind entirely."" Obviously, calling out the hypocrisy of al Qaeda and ISIS won't change these organizations' goals -- they will continue to invoke Islam as cover for their political ambitions because it helps them entice new recruits and raise funds which are vital for their continued existence. But maybe if their hypocrisy is consistently laid bare then it might help all understand the true motivation of these terrorist groups and hopefully even give pause to any Muslims thinking of joining their un-Islamic cause. After all, al Qaeda and ISIS aren't interested in upholding the principles of Islam. They are focused only on power, however many Muslim lives they take.​ .","Dean Obeidallah: Al Qaeda kills more Muslims than non-Muslims .

"The attorney for a 14-year-old Florida girl charged with aggravated stalking that allegedly led to the suicide of a 12-year-old classmate told CNN that her client isn't responsible for a controversial Facebook post that led to the suspect's arrest. Police on Monday arrested two girls, ages 14 and 12, in connection with the death of Rebecca Sedwick, who jumped from the top of an abandoned concrete plant last month. Authorities said the 14-year-old girl was Rebecca's chief tormenter, and the girl posted a taunting message Saturday on the Internet about what had happened. ""Yes IK I bullied REBECCA nd she killed her self but IDGAF,"" the Facebook post read. Grady Judd, sheriff of Polk County, Florida, said the online vernacular meant ""I don't give a (expletive)."" The 14-year-old's lawyer, Andrea DeMichael, told CNN her client ""says that this is not as clear cut as it seems."" The girl denies she stalked Rebecca and she hasn't accessed Facebook recently, DeMichael said. The girls, minors who are not being named by CNN, were charged with aggravated stalking. Rebecca's mother called the arrests the best birthday present her daughter, who would have turned 13 this weekend, could have received. ""Because justice is finally being served,"" Tricia Norman told CNN. ""Something's finally being done about these girls that are bullying her. That's all she ever wanted was somebody to listen and do something about it."" It all started with a boy . The intense bullying that authorities say led to Rebecca's suicide stemmed from a dispute between her and a former classmate over a boy they had both dated, police said Tuesday. After the Facebook post Saturday, police contacted the suspects and their parents and asked them to come in, according to DeMichael, who advised her client not to do so. Judd said his office acted after the taunting post. ""She forced this arrest,"" Judd said of the 14-year-old's alleged decision to post the message. He said investigators don't believe her Facebook account was compromised. Parents, beware of bullying on sites you've never seen . Judd sent detectives to arrest her and a 12-year-old friend at their homes. They were booked Monday, and the 12-year-old was released to her parents, Judd said. The 14-year-old made her first court appearance Tuesday and was being kept at a juvenile detention facility. Friends have a falling out . According to Judd, the girl was upset that Rebecca had once dated her current boyfriend and began bullying and harassing her more than a year ago when they were both students at a Florida middle school. In addition to sending harassing messages over the Internet, the girl physically attacked Rebecca at least once, Judd said. She also recruited the girl's former best friend -- the 12-year-old charged Monday -- to bully her, Judd said. DeMichael disputed there was any harassment or fight. She said the 14-year-old and Rebecca did have a falling out over the boy, and there was some ""back and forth"" at school between the former friends, but the girl never threatened Rebecca. ""She was actually upset at what happened to the victim,"" DeMichael said. Are we too quick to cry 'bully'? 'I'm jumping' Among the online messages that drove Rebecca to jump to her death were, ""You should die"" and ""why don't you go kill yourself?"" Judd said. The night before Rebecca killed herself, authorities say, she messaged a boy she had befriended online, writing, ""I'm jumping. I can't take it anymore."" Judd, clearly upset about the incident, expressed frustration that neither girl's parents were willing to bring them in for questioning. He said he was astonished to find out that the 14-year-old in the case was still being allowed to post to the Internet after what had happened. He said he would charge the child's parents if he could, but said investigators were aware of no ""obvious charges"" against them. ""I'm aggravated that the parents aren't doing what they are supposed to be doing,"" he said. Norman said she blamed the parents of the two girls and the staff at the middle school. She and Rebecca reported the bullying to the school, she said. While bullying was not in itself against the law, Judd said, the girls' actions allegedly harassing Rebecca in school and online formed the basis for the stalking charge. He did not expect any other charges would be filed. No court date has yet been set for the girls, who Judd said will probably not see any time in juvenile detention because they have no previous criminal records and the charge is a class-three felony, one step up from a misdemeanor under Florida law. Had Rebecca been 17 or older, he said, authorities could have filed nothing more than misdemeanor charges. He implored parents to take more responsibility for the actions of their children online. ""We've lost sleep over that child dying needlessly, and we want to see things change,"" he said. ""We want to never, ever, ever investigate a case like that again.""

"(CNN)Duke University officials on Friday cited security concerns as part of the reason for the school's reversal of its decision to allow a Muslim call to prayer to sound from a campus chapel bell tower. Neither the Durham, North Carolina, school nor the local FBI office, which was made aware of the situation at Duke, would specify details of these concerns, but Michael J. Schoenfeld, the university's vice president of public affairs, said the number and tone of the calls were ""pretty loud and nasty."" ""We have heard from a lot of people who have a lot of interesting and important opinions and perspectives on this,"" Schoenfeld said. In a statement Thursday, the school said plans changed because its effort to ""unify was not having the intended effect."" The Duke Muslim Students Association had planned to chant the call, or adhan, from the Duke Chapel bell tower. The adhan signals the beginning of the weekly prayer service. Jummah prayers have taken place in the basement of Duke Chapel for many years. ""Duke remains committed to fostering an inclusive, tolerant and welcoming campus for all of its students,"" Schoenfeld said. ""I think when you do these kind of things you like to think and you hope that it will be seen by others as you see them as enlightened ways to introduce diversity and the celebration of faith tradition, but unfortunately it doesn't happen the way you would like it."" Plans for the audible call to prayer have been in the works since fall semester and are not in response to recent criticism of Muslims after the latest terror attacks and arrests, a source with close knowledge of the situation told CNN. The source also said  the request did not come from the Muslim community on campus, but rather the university administration. The university's Imam Abdullah Antepli said his community was disappointed in the school's reversal. But he had praise for Duke, calling its offerings to the Muslim community ""far more comprehensive than many other universities in the entire U.S."" Schoenfeld said there will continue to be a call to prayer and service as usual. ""The only thing that has changed,"" he said, ""is that it will not come from the bell tower of the Duke Chapel as previously announced."" There were no shortage of opinions on both sides after the reversal. Franklin Graham, son of legendary evangelist Billy Graham, applauded the school. Graham had called on donors to withhold support over the plan to allow the adnan, questioning whether evangelical Christians at Duke would be allowed to broadcast their ""message across campus."" Others expressed their disappointment in Duke for the reversal. Omid Safi, head of Islamic studies at Duke University, directed a criticism at Graham. ""Spare me,"" Safi's Facebook post says, ""Spare me the paranoia of a wealthy white male Christian who talks about being marginalized in America."" The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights group, called the decision unfortunate, saying the university bowed to intimidation. Members of the Muslim community will now gather on the quadrangle outside the chapel, a site of frequent interfaith programs and activities, before moving to their regular location for prayers. More than 700 of Duke's 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students identify as Muslim. ""Our Muslim community enriches the university in countless ways,"" Schoenfeld said. Antepli added, ""I see as opportunity, opportunity for people of all faiths, backgrounds and customs to come together and to learn from one another and to love each other."" CNN's Emma Lacey-Bordeaux contributed to this report.","Source tells CNN that the request for the call from the tower had come from Duke's administration .

"(CNN)Eight inmates and two correctional officers were killed Wednesday morning when their transport bus left the roadway and collided with a moving train in west Texas, officials said. Five more people -- four inmates and one staff member -- were injured in the incident outside Penwell and were taken to an Odessa hospital, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said.

"U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sustained a concussion after becoming dehydrated and fainting, and will no longer testify Thursday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Clinton had been suffering from a stomach virus at the time, according to a statement on Saturday from Philippe Reines, deputy assistant secretary of state. She is being monitored by doctors and is recovering at home. She was never hospitalized, Reines said. ""At their recommendation, she will continue to work from home next week, staying in regular contact with Department and other officials.  She is looking forward to being back in the office soon,"" Reines said. A senior State Department official added that the fainting occurred earlier in the week and the concussion was ""not severe."" Source: Obama to tap Kerry to be secretary of state . Secretary Clinton had been scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill Thursday about the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, in September that killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador. Jodi Seth, spokeswoman for Democratic Sen. John Kerry, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, said in a statement that Clinton would not testify before that committee Thursday. ""Secretary Clinton's team contacted Senator Kerry this morning to inform them of the Secretary's concussion. Senator Kerry was relieved to hear that the Secretary is on the mend, but he insisted that given her condition, she could not and should not appear on Thursday as previously planned, and that the nation's best interests are served by the report and hearings proceeding as scheduled with senior officials appearing in her place,"" Seth said.

"(CNN)The family of boxing legend Muhammad Ali hopes he will be home from the hospital in time for his 73rd birthday on Saturday. Ali, who has Parkinson's disease, has been in an undisclosed hospital this week getting follow-up care for a urinary tract infection, a spokesman for the family said Thursday. Bob Gunnell said Ali is in stable condition and doctors indicated he would be released Friday. Ali was initially released from the hospital on January 7 after an 18-day stay. Born Cassius Clay, the fighter won an Olympic gold medal as a light-heavyweight at 18. In 1964, he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory against Sonny Liston. Shortly thereafter, he changed his name to Muhammad Ali to reflect his conversion to Islam. The boxer was also known for his protest against the Vietnam War and refusal to be drafted into service because of his religious conviction. He won his first 31 fights before losing to Joe Frazier in a 1971 fight hailed by some boxing experts as one of the greatest matches of all time. He retired from boxing in 1981 as a four-time heavyweight champion and announced his diagnosis with Parkinson's disease three years later.","Muhammad Ali is getting follow-up care for a urinary tract infection, a spokesman says .

"(CNN)About halfway up the cobblestone stairwell, the screeching starts. Loose stones tumble from the tops of the walls far up on the hilltop. All around me, tree limbs shake. It's just after dawn, and I'm alone, climbing the trail to the 15th-century royal compound on the hilltop at Great Zimbabwe in southern Africa. Alone, except for the baboons. Like all the stone structures here, the stairwell is open to the sky, but the incline is so steep and the curves so sharp that I can't see more than 10 feet in front of me. Sure enough, around the next bend a baboon is waiting for me on one of the dozens of terraces that skirt the hillside. We watch each other for a few moments until I'm certain he's not interested in me, and then I keep walking. Baboons freak me out, but these moments are part of what makes Great Zimbabwe such an incredible place to visit. Baboon standoffs . Unlike the world's more visited ruins -- which is basically every other ruin -- here it's easy to lose yourself in the mystery of the place, even if that means the occasional standoff with a baboon. The stairwell leads to a narrow passage through a cleft in the rocky hilltop. Stone walls that form the perimeter of the royal complex tower overhead. They once would've extended even farther out over the stairs, but a terrace collapsed since the city was abandoned, bringing a wall down with it. It's hard to find a vantage point to see the entire complex. The old city, which was the capital of a trading empire and home to 10,000 people in the 1400s, stretches over 1,800 acres. Essentially the hilltop functioned as a palace and cathedral, the center of political and religious power. On the planes below, circular stone walls form a series of enclosures. The most iconic, aptly called the Great Enclosure, is the largest pre-colonial structure south of the Sahara. The walls rise up 36 feet and stretch 820 feet around. At one end, an inner wall forms a narrow passage that leads to a conical tower, the most distinctive landmark in the old city. I like the hill complex more. Here the walls curve around each other and the granite boulders, which are incorporated into the design. Different chambers are linked by a labyrinth of narrow passages that snake up and down over the giant rocks. At the far side is a chamber with a towering stone ledge that once held a small stone wall that acted like a balustrade. Destructive treasure hunters . Like all the structures here, the stones were assembled without mortar. Each layer was slightly recessed, creating a slope that held it all together. Over the centuries, some walls were knocked down by treasure hunters, or just by the elements. The chamber below is where a famous set of carved birds were found. Most of them are now housed in a small museum inside the park, which is worth a visit if only to see them. The image of a bird appears on the national flag, and is as much a symbol of Zimbabwe's national identity as the Statue of Liberty is to the United States. There's a good chance of being here alone. Visitors might see schoolchildren passing through on their way to class, or the occasional park worker, but not many other visitors. Tourism in Zimbabwe has been in a long and slow recovery. In the 1990s, Zimbabwe was for a moment the most visited country in sub-Saharan Africa. By the time the nation hit rock bottom in 2008, hardly any foreign visitors came. Now major attractions like Victoria Falls are bouncing back, but places like Great Zimbabwe have fallen far off the radar. The ruins are easily accessible by road, but it takes several hours from Harare or a full day from Johannesburg, so not many people make the effort. But this is a place I love returning to. Expert tours . In the colonial days when Zimbabwe was known as Rhodesia, white families used to vacation here, and remnants of those days remain. The national park has simple rondavel huts for hire, and there's the dated but charming Great Zimbabwe Hotel (Great Zimbabwe, Masvingo; +263 39 262274) just outside the gates, as well as the posher safari-style Lodge at the Ancient City (No 1 shephared Plot, Great Zimbabwe, Masvingo; +1 888 790 5264). The inn's restaurant -- where the buffet is designed like the stone walls -- serves lucky travelers fresh bream from the nearby dam. If not, there's almost always a fisherman selling his catch on the roadside, which can be grilled outdoors -- or ask the restaurant to prepare it. On my latest trip, I went with an excursion organized by The Wits School of Arts at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Those going on their own can hire a guide on site. Every guide I've ever had here has been articulate and charming and well-informed, but it's even more amazing to spend a few days exploring the ruins with people who actually wrote the book on Great Zimbabwe. You can find their offerings at wsoa.wits.ac.za, under History of Art. Practical tips: Zimbabwe has started an online visa system (www.evisa.gov.zw/), which isn't working at the time of this writing. When it does, applying online will get visitors a letter that they must present on arrival, which is when the visa is actually issued. Those that require a visa might be better off simply getting it on arrival. Anyone driving up from South Africa can save themselves a lot of hassle at the border by contacting the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority ahead of time. They can arrange to have an officer to wait at the border post and walk visitors through the immigration and customs process. This can save hours and endless headaches.

"Alan Freed, the DJ credited with coining the term ""rock 'n' roll,"" will be physically removed from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Monday. An urn with Freed's ashes was taken from its spot at the Cleveland museum on Friday, and Freed's son will pick up his father's remains Monday, according to Executive Director Greg Harris. Lance Freed told CNN that the museum was being ""disrespectful"" to his father's legacy as a pioneer of rock 'n' roll, but Harris said Freed will continue to be ""very prominent"" in the hall. Harris disputed the Freed family's description of the removal as an eviction, but according to the son, it is not a voluntary removal. Freed's ashes are being ousted just days after the museum opened a Beyonce exhibit featuring the singer's costumes, including the black leotards worn in her 2008 ""Single Ladies"" video. Freed started playing R&B records on his Cleveland radio show in 1951, a time when stations that targeted white listeners ignored black artists.  He called it ""rock 'n' roll.""  His ""Moondog Coronation Ball"" at the Cleveland Arena in March 1956 is considered the first major rock concert. The rock 'n roll song that started it all . Freed put Cleveland on the music map and rock 'n' roll on the radio.  His connection to the city was a major reason the northeastern Ohio city was chosen as the home for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, both his son and Harris said. Freed was initially interred in New York, the city where he died at 43 in 1965. His family moved his remains to Cleveland years later and then to the museum 12 years ago, Lance Freed said. ""I thought this was the last move, but then I got this call to move him,"" Freed said. ""He said, 'You've got to come pick him up.' "" It was not a rushed or unilateral decision, Harris said. ""The museum world is moving away from exhibiting remains"" since ashes don't help tell a story, he said. ""Museum community colleagues across the country agree."" Lance Freed said he believed his father's exhibit is being downsized and moved to another area of the museum, but Harris said it is not being changed beyond removal of the gold urn. Harris suggested that Freed's son might feel better about the move after he visits the museum Monday morning. ""We are conscious of his important role and will continue to honor him,"" Harris said.  The museum's radio studio is named for him, and there ""are many touch points"" in the hall that relate to Freed, he said. Freed's role in breaking down racial barriers in U.S. pop culture in the 1950s, by leading white and black kids to listen to the same music, made put the radio personality ""at the vanguard"" and made him ""a really important figure,"" Harris said. Harris defended the ouster of Freed's ashes coming at the same time that Beyonce's leotards are welcomed into the hall of fame.  ""Rock and roll isn't just about yesterday,"" he said.  ""It continues to evolve, and we continue to embrace it and refine our operations."" The Freed family will spend the next several weeks deciding where in Cleveland to take the urn, his son said. They want to ""create some sort of modest memorial where people who want to pay respect, or reflect,"" can visit, he said. ""I'm a little bit emotional right now, because this is the third time I'm moving my dad,"" he said. ""But hopefully it will be the last."" Emotional night at Rock Hall of Fame Induction .

"Washington (CNN)The House of Representatives' Sergeant at Arms said Thursday that Congress was ""never in danger"" from a plot by a United States citizen to attack the U.S. Capitol, but that officials are still monitoring the situation. In an email obtained by CNN that was sent to all House members and staff, Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving says that ""law enforcement was diligent from the onset and the FBI was able to quickly identify the threat, investigate, and make an arrest."" ""The public, and in particular the Congressional community, was never in danger during the investigation. The United States Capitol Police (USCP) remains in close coordination with the FBI and my office continues to monitor the situation,"" Irving writes. ""We will keep you informed of any important developments that may arise."" Irving also urges the Capitol community to ""maintain vigilance and security awareness at all times."" ""I know you have heard it before, but it bears repeating today: if you see something, say something,"" he adds. The email comes just the day after the FBI successfully foiled a plot to attack the U.S. Capitol that was being developed by Christopher Lee Cornell, a 20-year-old Ohioan who was allegedly inspired by ISIS. The incident is the latest to highlight the threat posed by radicalized young men used by terrorist groups to carry out attacks in their own countries. The terrorists in France last week became increasingly radicalized while in prison before traveling to Yemen, where at least one met with the American jihadist Anwar al-Awlaki, a notorious al Qaeda cleric. The brothers' travel to Yemen and intelligence reports that one also traveled to Syria turned the West's worst fears — foreign fighters returning to the West to carry out attacks — into a grisly reality. And Maine Sen. Angus King, a member of the Senate's intelligence and armed services committee, said on Thursday echoed intelligence assessments that ""lone wolf"" terrorists are the ""toughest"" threat to counter. ""The real weapons of mass destruction today are unemployed 22-year-olds who fall for this radical ideology and we've got to figure out how to counter that,"" he said on CNN's ""New Day."" Sen. King on torture report: 'This is not America' But he disagreed with his Republican colleagues, most notably Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona), who argue that the U.S. needs to ramp up its military effort against ISIS and other terrorist organizations. ""We've been in the stamping out business for the last 12 or 13 years and it hasn't worked all that well,"" King said. ""Part of the problem is the more we, the U.S. and the West, are active — particularly with troops on the ground — the more it becomes a recruiting tool for the extremists."" Instead, King said the U.S. needs to address what he called a ""deeper question"": figuring out how the U.S. can combat the radical ideology spread increasingly online by extremists like ISIS and al-Qaeda. King pointed to a program being developed in the United Kingdom, where officials are working to ""de-radicalize or anti-radicalize"" their prisons, which can be hotbeds of extremist recruitment. Even ISIS, which now controls swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria and seeks to inspire the lone wolf attacks U.S. officials are most concerned about, was reportedly formed from an American military prison in Iraq, Camp Bucca, according to The Guardian. There, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi met the men who would years later become the branches of ISIS's senior leadership. King stood firm against calls from McCain and other Republican hawks like freshman Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) who are calling on President Barack Obama to escalate the military fight against ISIS. And American troops certainly shouldn't be the ones ""rooting them (ISIS) out door to door in Mosul,"" a city ISIS captured in Iraq. RELATED: Tom Cotton on terror threat: 'We have to win on offense' ""We are not going to be able to take them out by killing them one at a time. It's not going to work,"" King said. ""We've got to go deeper than just police, FBI, CIA and military. We've got to talk about how do we stop this movement toward radicalization because otherwise this is going to be a 100-year war."" Obama and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron made it clear in an opinion piece published Thursday that they are closely watching the threat of lone wolfs, vowing not to be ""cowed by extremists,"" whether they come in the shape of terrorist groups or ""lone fanatics."" Reacting to the foiled Ohio plot in an interview with NewsMax, potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate Texas Gov. Rick Perry made a quick connection between terrorism and border security, one of his top issues. Perry said there is ""very good intelligence"" that the south Texas border with Mexico could allow ""individuals"" to come into this country. ""Americans will sleep better knowing that their government is actual doing their constitutional duty,"" Perry said.","After an Ohio man's alleged ISIS-inspired plot was foiled by the FBI, King says the U.S. needs to counter radicalization .

"(CNN)""Birdman"" had wings. ""The Imitation Game"" cracked the code. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" did grand business. But not all esteemed films did so well at the Oscar nominations Thursday morning. Complete list of Oscar nominations . Here are 5 things we learned: . 1. Fifty years after the event it portrayed, ""Selma"" is (again) a flashpoint . The highly praised movie about a key period in the civil-rights movement stars David Oyelowo as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and was directed by relative newcomer Ava DuVernay. Both Oyelowo and DuVernay, in particular, had been singled out for acclaim, but when the Oscar nominations came down, both were shut out. ""Selma"" ended up with just two nominations: best picture and best song. The Internet, noting the lack of diversity among the acting and directing categories, reacted with scorn. ""Selma"" had been criticized for the way it portrayed some aspects of history -- particularly the role of President Lyndon B. Johnson --  but as a movie, the reviews were resoundingly favorable, with 99% approval on RottenTomatoes.com. Noting that other directing nominees weren't penalized for their movies' inaccuracies, Forbes' Scott Mendelson wrote, ""Ms. DuVernay, more than her peers, arguably needed that Oscar validation as a bargaining chip."" He added, pointedly, ""I'm angry because one of the best films of the year has been libeled and that said libel apparently worked."" But Common, who received a best song nomination for the film, handled the issue gracefully. ""I believe when people vote, they have their perspectives, they have what they think is right and we have to understand, it's a vote,"" he told CNN. ""I just say whatever color we are, keep making quality work and I know it will eventually be recognized."" 2. The divide between blockbusters and low-budget films grows . With the expanded list of best-picture nominees, more box-office hits -- films earning $100 million or more domestically -- have made the Oscar grade in recent years. But of this year's eight nominees, the highest-grossing film domestically is ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" which came out in March, and it's made just $59 million. CNNMoney: Box office duds threaten Oscar ratings . Such hits as ""Gone Girl,"" ""Into the Woods,"" ""Unbroken"" and ""Interstellar,"" all considered awards possibilities, didn't make the Academy's shortlist. (Admittedly, some of the nominees have just been released, so their box office could climb significantly.) Los Angeles Times film writer Steve Zeitchik, who wrote about the snubs and surprises, is surprised himself that more blockbusters didn't make the list. ""The Academy is probably going back and wondering, did we accomplish what we wanted to accomplish by expanding it?"" he says. ""The fact that there's no 'Gone Girl,' no 'Unbroken,' no 'Interstellar,' is certainly notable on an Academy list that's meant include films of that type."" 3. Score one for veterans . Sure, there were some Oscar newcomers, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Redmayne, Rosamund Pike, Emma Stone and Felicity Jones. And though Steve Carell and Michael Keaton are established performers, they'd never gotten Oscar nominations. But the nods were full of familiar names, some of which surprised observers. Robert Duvall, who at 84 is now the oldest supporting actor nominee ever, received his seventh nod. Julianne Moore now has five nominations. Bradley Cooper made it for the third year in a row. Clint Eastwood, though not nominated for best director, was recognized through his ""American Sniper,"" which got six nominations (including Cooper's). And Meryl Streep, as always, is in a class by herself. Her nomination for playing a witch in ""Into the Woods"" is her 19th overall, extending her own record. Is it deserved? That's a whole different discussion. 4. Watch out for ""Budapest"" -- and ""Whiplash"" ""Birdman"" and ""Boyhood"" have been battling it out all awards season. It'll be no different on Oscar night: Although ""Birdman"" has more nominations, ""Boyhood"" is generally considered the favorite. But in a mild surprise, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" which has stayed in the discussion despite being released 10 months ago (just after the 2014 ceremony, in fact), has continued to build steam, including its best comedy/musical win at the Golden Globes. Wes Anderson finally earned a directing nomination, and the movie has a gravitas that could make it a popular second choice for Oscar voters, despite its comic tone. ""Whiplash"" almost certainly won't win best picture, but the nominations for this Sundance winner about a hard-driving music teacher and his egocentric student are an achievement on their own given its minuscule budget and limited distribution. Damian Chazelle, who's at work on another musical (this one with ""Whiplash"" star Miles Teller and Emma Watson), will be a name to watch, and J.K. Simmons may soon become the most-esteemed M&M in history. 5. 'Lego' falls apart . Besides the ""Selma"" shocker, perhaps the biggest surprise of the morning was the lack of love for ""The Lego Movie."" What could have been two hours of product placement was instead a clever, heartwarming film about the need for affection and togetherness, and it was widely expected to earn a nomination for best animated feature -- and perhaps its screenplay. Instead it got just one nomination, for its song ""Everything Is Awesome."" Zeitchik wonders whether the movie was too hip for the room. ""The feeling has been that a more conservative or stodgy voter would not quite spark to the film,"" he says. ""I think there's a constituency within the (animators') branch that maybe felt that this was a little too cutting-edge."" ""Lego Movie"" co-director, co-writer and co-producer Philip Lord, however, wasn't going to be denied. He posted a photo of an Oscar -- made of Lego.","""Selma's"" lack of nominations prompts backlash .
Of the eight best picture nominees, none has been a big hit .
Many had expected ""The Lego Movie"" to get an animated-feature nod ."
"A federal judge set bail Friday for four of 10 men facing kidnapping charges after allegedly arranging the violent assaults of Orthodox Jewish husbands, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Judge Douglas Arpert set bail at $1 million for Jay ""Yaakov"" Goldstein, while the other three -- Moshe Goldstein, Avrohom Goldstein and Simcha Bulmash -- had bail set at $500,000, said Matthew Riley, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, District of New Jersey. Jay Goldstein's attorney, Aidan P. O'Connor, told CNN on Thursday he hoped his client would be able to leave jail and reunite with his family. Goldstein, Rabbi Mendel Epstein and Rabbi Martin Wolmark, along with seven other defendants, are accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars to orchestrate the kidnappings of Jewish husbands to persuade them to grant divorces to their wives, according to a criminal complaint. Goldstein is a sofer, a Jewish scribe who transcribes the Torah and writes other religious documents, including divorce papers, according to his attorney. On Wednesday, Arpert set bail between $500,000 and $1 million for the two rabbis, along with four other defendants: Ariel Potash, Binyamin Stimler, David Hellman and Sholom Shuchat. Arpert also ordered home arrest -- with exceptions to leave for medical reasons, attorney meetings and religious purposes -- for all six, according to court documents. Jay Goldstein, the rabbis and the other men were arrested after an FBI undercover investigation that led to a raid on October 9, according to the criminal complaint. In one conversation with undercover FBI agents, the complaint alleges that Epstein talked about forcing the divorces with the help of hired ""tough guys,"" who he said used plastic bags to cover the husbands' heads, and electric cattle prods and karate to assault them. ""I guarantee you that if you're in the van, you'd give a 'get' to your wife. You probably love your wife, but you'd give a 'get' when they finish with you,"" Epstein told the undercover FBI agents. A ""get"" is a document that Jewish law requires a husband to present to his wife to be issued a divorce, the complaint says. Without it, a woman is considered an ""agunah,"" a chained woman bound to a man no matter how over their marriage might be. The implications of not having a get are serious in the Orthodox Jewish world. For Jews of other denominations, who interpret Jewish law differently, the requirement of a get is less stringent or dismissed altogether. An Orthodox Jewish woman who does not receive a get, however, runs the risk of being shunned in her community and labeled an adulteress if she dares move on. And any future children she has are considered bastards permitted to marry only other bastards. The complaint says that Epstein told the undercover FBI agents that his organization had kidnapped a husband every 12 to 18 months. The complaint also says that Wolmark told the agents, ""You need special rabbis who are going to take this thing and see it through to the end."" ""I can say that we are pleased the court accepted our bail proposal. I anticipate Rabbi Wolmark will be released shortly,"" said Marc Agnifilo, Wolmark's attorney. ""The rabbi is a highly respected Gittin scholar, and he steadfastly denies the allegations that he ordered violence,"" said Agnifilo. Wolmark, Esptein and Potash's attorneys all told CNN that they are confident their clients will have their bail processed and be out on a house arrest by the end of this week. CNN's calls to the other defendant's attorneys were not answered. All 10 defendants pleaded not guilty last week. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of life in prison.","Jay Goldstein has bail set at $1 million; 3 others get $500,000 bail each .

"Perhaps it was a foregone conclusion, what with the Internet's proven ability to turn any new technology into a platform for showing naked people. But Twitter's new video-sharing app, Vine, is under scrutiny after early adopters started using it to flash six-second porn clips to the app's users and to the larger Twitter community. It's an issue that has Twitter scrambling to appease concerns. And it's raising questions about how Apple, the only place where smartphone users can download the app, will respond after recently banning other apps that provide access to sexual content. The issue gained attention Monday when Vine users noticed a video of what was described as hard-core pornography showcased in the prominent Editor's Picks section of the mobile app. Users took to the comment section of that video to complain. Twitter apologized Monday, saying it was a mistake. ""A human error resulted in a video with adult content becoming one of the videos in Editor's Picks, and upon realizing this mistake we removed the video immediately,"" the company said in a statement sent to CNN. ""We apologize to our users for the error."" Released Thursday, Vine is a Twitter-owned app that lets users create and share videos lasting up to six seconds. As with photo-sharing app Instagram, Vine users can follow other people, whose posted videos show up in a feed on their phones or can be shared on Twitter and Facebook. The app is available only for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Vine's Apple-only status raises interesting questions. Just last week, Apple banned image-sharing app 500px from its App Store because it could give users access to sexual content. The 500px app features artistically rendered nudes among lots of other photos, but so do other apps with user-generated content, such as Tumblr, which remain available on Apple's iOS mobile system. The Vine app is rated 12+ on iTunes for ""infrequent/mild sexual content or nudity,"" among other reasons, meaning it's deemed appropriate for users 12 or older. As of Monday, it was the fifth most popular free app in the App Store. Apple did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment for this story. Vine had been listed on Apple's own Editor's Choice list as early as Monday morning, but appeared to have been removed by Monday afternoon. Apple observers Monday were noting the strange position the company finds itself in. Apple has famously kept tight reins on what appears in its App Store and on its mobile operating system in general. The late CEO Steve Jobs famously argued that control on the front end delivers a user experience free from porn, spam and other digital unpleasantness. But as the digital Web grows and evolves, it's becoming tougher to parse the blurry line between apps that promote adult content (and which are turned down or banned by Apple as a matter of course) and those which simply provide access to such fare. What, for example, is the distinction between the banned 500px app and the app for Tumblr, the blogging platform which, among its millions of blogs, includes many that host explicit sexual content? ""From the start, Apple has said they'd get the App Store wrong, and come across things they didn't anticipate, but that they'd learn and grow,"" said Rene Richie, editor of Apple-centric blog iMore, in a post Monday. ""This particular problem has been around for years, but as social sharing has become easier, it's come to the surface again."" Interestingly, it was just a little less than a year ago that Apple banned Viddy, a video-sharing app that has been compared to Vine, because it gave access to user-generated adult videos. The Viddy app was eventually returned to the App Store. On Twitter's end, the anything-goes aspect of Vine jibes with the site's overall philosophy. Compared to Facebook, which believes social sharing is best when tied to a user's true identity and real-world networks, Twitter allows its users to register under fake names and has fought governments and law-enforcement agencies seeking user information. As such, Twitter has taken a more hands-off approach on adult content. It's not hard to hunt down hashtags its users are employing to share adult content on a daily basis. (#TwitterAfterDark becomes a trending topic on the site nearly every day -- clicker beware). By contrast, searching for several suggestive hashtags (such as #naked or #porn) on Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app bought by Facebook last year, render no results. Because Instagram is an Apple-like closed environment, sexually explicit images are difficult, if not impossible, to find there. By Monday afternoon, hours after Vine had apologized and deleted the porn video from its Editors Picks, what uproar there was online was subsiding. As some observers noted, Vine isn't otherwise experiencing anything new in the tech world. ""As virtually every new video or photo-sharing service has shown us since the dawn of the Internet, from Flickr to ChatRoulette, it's very difficult to keep these sites or apps G-rated. So the companies either learn how to police it well, like Flickr does, or they wither and die, as ChatRoulette did,"" wrote The Atlantic Wire's Adam Clark Estes in a post titled ""Vine has a porn problem because, of course it does."" In a statement to CNN, Twitter noted what had already become apparent on the app -- that users can report videos they deem inappropriate. ""Videos that have been reported as inappropriate have a warning message that a viewer must click through before viewing the video,"" a spokesperson said in the statement. Reported videos that are determined to violate Vine guidelines will be removed from the site and the user account that posted them may be terminated, according to the statement. Vine's terms of service ban illegal activity, harassment or abuse and behavior such as impersonating another user or violating trademark and copyright.","An error led to a porn video being listed as an editor's pick in Twitter's new Vine app .

"(CNN)Lassana Bathily risked his own life to help save others, a Muslim who protected Jews in the face of an armed terrorist. Now the French government is helping out Bathily -- by making him a citizen. The Malian native's citizenship application, which he filed in July, will be expedited, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve announced Thursday. Cazeneuve will conduct Bathily's citizenship ceremony himself Tuesday. This event will add to what has been an emotional few weeks for Bathily, starting with his heroic actions Friday, after a gunman burst in while he was working at the kosher Hyper Cacher grocery store near Paris' Porte de Vincennes. The man took several people hostage but not the 15 whom Bathily led downstairs into a walk-in freezer. Bathily, who describes himself as a ""practicing Muslim,"" told CNN affiliate BFMTV he switched off the freezer, turned off the lights and told everyone to stay calm. ""I'm the one (who) is going to go out,"" the 24-year-old reportedly told the customers. ""I took the elevator and went upstairs."" Bathily told BFMTV that he went up after the hostage-taker -- whom authorities have identified as Amedy Coulibaly -- ""asked us to all come upstairs."" If they didn't? ""Otherwise, he would kill everyone who was downstairs,"" the young man said. So Bathily did go upstairs, taking a freight elevator. But he didn't go toward Coulibaly. Instead, he ran outside. Police apprehended Bathily there, and he told them the location of the freezer and gave details about those inside. ""When (the hostages) came out, they congratulated me,"" Bathily told BFMTV. That's because his actions might have saved their lives. Four people, plus the gunman, ended up being killed by the time the hostage situation ended. French media quickly ran with the story of Bathily, with L'Express newspaper proclaiming ""Lassana Bathily, Malian Muslim, hero of the hostage situation in Vincennes."" People around the world also cheered Bathily, with about 300,000 signing a Change.org petition asking that he be given the Legion d'Honneur, a highly prestigious award given to those who done exceptional things for France. ""Even in darkness and desolation, there's always a ray of light somewhere,"" wrote the petition's creator, Thiaba Bruni. ""Such is the case with Lassana Bathily."" Such positive recognition was also all over Facebook, where a man who claimed to be Bathily's cousin, Abdoul Bathily, posted, ""Lass Bathily, you showed courage yesterday. The rest of the world would not have done it."" Another person wrote, ""I have no words to express my pride in you. You put your life in danger to save others. God saw all of it, and his mercy will be without fault. You are blessed in the eyes of humanity."" Gunman tried to justify market raid to hostages, recording apparently shows .

"North Korea is accusing the U.S. government of being behind the making of the movie ""The Interview."" And, in a dispatch on state media, the totalitarian regime warned the United States that its ""citadels"" will be attacked, dwarfing the hacking attack on Sony that led to the cancellation of the film's release. Obama: North Korea's hack not war, but 'cybervandalism' While steadfastly denying involvement in the hack, North Korea accused U.S. President Barack Obama of calling for ""symmetric counteraction."" ""The DPRK has already launched the toughest counteraction. Nothing is more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. Our target is all the citadels of the U.S. imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans,"" a report on state-run KCNA read. ""Our toughest counteraction will be boldly taken against the White House, the Pentagon and the whole U.S. mainland, the cesspool of terrorism,"" the report said, adding that ""fighters for justice"" including the ""Guardians of Peace"" -- a group that claimed responsibility for the Sony attack -- ""are sharpening bayonets not only in the U.S. mainland but in all other parts of the world."" 'Act of cybervandalism' The FBI on Friday pinned blame on North Korea for a hack into Sony's computer systems. In an interview broadcast Sunday on CNN, Obama called it ""an act of cybervandalism,"" not war. He said the United States is going to review whether to put North Korea back on a list of states that sponsor terrorism. ""We've got very clear criteria as to what it means for a state to sponsor terrorism. And we don't make those judgments just based on the news of the day,"" Obama said. ""We look systematically at what's been done and based on those facts, we'll make those determinations in the future."" The Republican National Committee urged cinema chains to show the movie. In a letter to their CEOs, RNC chairman Reince Priebus wrote: ""As a sign of my commitment, if you agree to show this movie, I will send a note to the Republican Party's millions of donors and supporters urging them to buy a ticket -- not to support one movie or Hollywood, but to show North Korea we cannot be bullied into giving up our freedom."" 'Dishonest reactionary movie' While the film was the work of private individuals, North Korea insisted otherwise in its statement. ""The DPRK has clear evidence that the U.S. administration was deeply involved in the making of such dishonest reactionary movie,"" it said. ""The Interview"" is a comedy, with plans for an attempted assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a central plot point. In a CNN interview on Friday, Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton said the studio had not ""given in"" to pressure from hackers and was still considering ways to distribute the movie. But that's not what the company initially said after canceling the film's release. On Wednesday night, a studio spokesperson said simply, ""Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film."" But in its latest statement, released Sunday, the company said: ""No decisions have been made. Sony is still exploring options for distribution.""","North Korea warns it will go after the White House, Pentagon and ""whole U.S. mainland""

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- Anger mounted Tuesday as police in the Philippines acknowledged mistakes in a hostage rescue effort that ended with the deaths of eight people on a tourist bus. Police shot and killed the gunman, former police officer Rolando Mendoza, who was apparently upset at having lost his job. He held hostage a busload of tourists from Hong Kong on Monday and according to witnesses, he was willing to cooperate before he was shot dead. In Hong Kong, flags flew at half-staff and radio talk shows were abuzz with criticism of authorities in the Philippines. The word ""incompetent"" was repeatedly heard. The deadly standoff unfolded live on television, which the gunman was able to watch on a monitor on the bus. ""We do not want to pass sweeping judgment or make early conclusions except to say that our intention to peacefully end this hostage drama was spoiled when the hostage-taker suddenly exhibited violent behavior and began shooting the hostages,"" Philippine National Police Chief Director General Jesus A. Verzosa said in a statement. National police said officials have already noted ""some observations and defects during their close monitoring of the unfolding events."" The statement did not provide details, but listed ""poor handling of the hostage negotiation,"" ""inadequate capability, skills, equipment and planning of the assault team,"" ""improper crowd control,"" ""inadequate training and competence of assault team leader,"" and ""non-compliance to media relations procedures in hostage situations."" Survivors were scheduled to leave the Philippines on Tuesday as officials and family members called on authorities to investigate. ""The investigation has got to find out, what was the turning point? What happened?"" Philippine National Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon told CNN on Tuesday. It was a dark moment for President Benigno S. Aquino III, who was elected by a landslide last spring with a promise to restore the nation's reputation. He declared a national day of mourning Wednesday. Gordon told CNN that interviews with survivors have revealed that the situation inside the bus changed dramatically toward the end of the 10-hour standoff. ""Apparently the man went berserk. He was telling everybody he was not going to harm [them]. ... He said that nobody's going to get harmed. He said that he was probably going to die, but not the hostages,"" he said. A woman who was on the bus told reporters her husband was killed when he tried to stop the gunman. ""My husband was very brave. He rushed out from the back of the bus to try to stop the killer,"" said the woman, who identified herself as Alicia Leung. She told reporters that she pretended to be dead in order to survive. ""Why did authorities not rescue us? There were so many of us on the bus. Why did no one come to rescue us? It is so cruel,"" she said. In Manila, Aquino said he had ordered an investigation and would wait until it is completed before deciding whether anyone should lose his or her job. In Hong Kong, officials and residents questioned how Filipino authorities had handled the hostage situation. ""This is a serious blow to Hong Kong people. We all feel very devastated,"" Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang told reporters Tuesday, saying that the government would soon announce community mourning events. Four men and four women were killed in the standoff, authorities in Hong Kong said. One passenger was critically wounded and six others were hospitalized with less serious injuries after the 10-hour standoff erupted into gunfire, Tsang said. The Hong Kong-based tour guide was among those who died, Hong Thai Travel said in a statement. Some of the victims were insured and would be compensated, the travel agency said. The gunman released nine of the hostages, including a mother and her three children, a man with diabetes, and two photographers. The bus driver also escaped. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office said Tuesday that two of the released hostages were British nationals. Manila police official Leocadio Santiago told CNN that Mendoza's family members spoke with him early in the standoff and that he appeared ""very reasonable and very psychologically stable."" Mendoza was a decorated police officer, winning several accolades. But his career spiraled downward when he was dismissed a year ago for extortion, Manila Vice Mayor Ikso Moreno said, and he wanted his motion for reconsideration to be heard. ""He felt that it was being neglected,"" Moreno said. ""So he went on hostaging a bus full of foreign individuals. So when we talked to him this afternoon, that's what he wanted."" Moreno said that Mendoza's brother was arrested because he was ""guilty of conspiring with his brother"" and allegedly helped instigate the shooting. Gordon said the brother's arrest may have pushed the gunman over the edge. ""When he saw his brother getting accosted by the policemen, he went berserk and he started firing,"" he said. CNN's Sarita Harilela and journalists Constance Cheng, Maria Ressa and Arlene Samson-Espiritu contributed to this report.","Gunman was able to watch live coverage of the standoff .

"(CNN)A best picture nomination is not exactly nothing. Many would argue that it's just about everything. Yet there was brush-fire-level rage on and off the Internet -- see #OscarsSoWhite -- following Thursday morning's announcement of this year's Academy Award nominations over the fact that ""Selma,"" the critically acclaimed drama about Martin Luther King Jr.'s epochal campaign for voting rights in the South, received only two Oscar nods, one of them for best picture. (The other was for best song: ""Glory,"" the Golden Globe-winning anthem co-written by Common and John Legend, which one can safely label the prohibitive early favorite its category.) Much of the anger was tilted, especially, toward the omission of the film's director, Ava DuVernay, whose nomination would have broken fresh ground as the first African American woman to compete for the best director Oscar. David Oyelowo's performance as King was likewise snubbed for a best actor slot while neither Paul Webb's original screenplay nor Bradford Young's cinematography, both deemed worthy competitors by movie critics, received the Academy's acknowledgment in both their respective categories. ""Selma's"" partisans cried racism at the Academy voters, even though a few of these critics pointed out that this was the pretty much the same Academy that a year ago conferred the best picture, best adapted screenplay and best supporting actress Oscars to ""12 Years a Slave."" I was prepared to offer that perspective, too -- until I noticed a distressing dichotomy looming on this branch. A depiction of African Americans in shameful, soul-depleting captivity is one thing; African Americans organized in open rebellion against their oppressors is very much another. Movie history has many films with black slaves and black victims. It's much harder to think of a Hollywood movie in which African Americans are depicted as the active agents of their own salvation. ""Selma"" is one of those movies. And its relative dearth of worthy nominations is viewed, fairly or not, as a collective snub of not just a movie, but of African Americans' vision of their own empowerment. It may have been bad timing, as the movie's nationwide release only took place last weekend. And many blamed Joseph A. Califano Jr.'s opinion piece in The Washington Post, which excoriated ""Selma's"" depiction of his former boss, Lyndon B. Johnson, as an impediment in King's campaign. That some journalists brought up Califano's grievances in other articles about the film may have contributed to some restraint, at least, in the campaign for greater Oscar support by Paramount, Selma's distributor. But one wonders about this: We are in a time when the voting rights legislation passed 50 years ago with the active support of both King and LBJ is under siege both in the courts and in some states. Why are people less focused on this clear and present danger and more caught up in questions of historical veracity of a Hollywood movie? Well ... we're still weeks away from the final vote. And however the chatter has leaned on ""Selma,"" those who support the movie should be grateful that there is chatter at all carrying the movie to the finish line. With Hollywood, one never knows. That best picture nomination could very well become a best picture win. Why? Why not?","Gene Seymour: At #OscarsSoWhite, many complain the 'Selma' Oscar snub is about race .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- An Orlando, Florida, airport official wants to join the small group of U.S. airports who use a private company to screen passengers instead of the Transportation Security Administration. Larry Dale, president of the Sanford Airport Authority in Orlando, says the airport first considered the change in February and it was approved on Oct. 5. ""Airports are unique...one size doesn't fit all,"" Dale told CNN's American Morning on Friday. Dale says his board and staff have been looking at other airports that provide their own security in preparation for making the switch at Orlando Sanford International Airport. Dale says his research shows that using a private security screening company would be ""more efficient and more enjoyable to the public."" Dale's comments come during a week in which the TSA has been under fire for it's airport screening procedures, including imaging technology and pat downs. TSA is in charge of protecting the nation's transportation systems. Private airport security is not uncommon. The TSA lists 16 airports that are currently participating in its Screening Partnership Program. They include San Francisco International Airport, Kansas City International Airport, Greater Rochester International Airport and Key West International Airport. Participating airports work with TSA to hire an approved security contractor and must follow TSA security guidelines when screening passengers and baggage, according to the TSA website. ""All commercial airports are regulated by TSA whether the actual screening is performed by the TSA officers or private companies. The TSA sets the security standards that must be followed and includes the use of enhanced pat downs and imaging technology, if installed at the airport,"" said TSA spokesman Greg Soule. Congressman John Mica, R-Florida, the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, wrote a letter to the nation's 100 busiest airports urging them to ditch the TSA for private security.

"(CNN)Picking through the rubble of war-damaged buildings in combat zones, looking for enemies, survivors, booby traps or worse is one of the most dangerous jobs in the military. To take the dirt and danger out of mopping up operations, a Pentagon agency is developing a surveillance robo-hawk that could fly through the detritus of the urban combat jungle at 45mph. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) -- already famous as the maker of some of the U.S. military's more far-fetched war robots -- aims to develop autonomous drones small enough to fit through an open window. Speeding through unstable buildings or threatening indoor spaces at 20 meters per second, the unmanned aerial vehicle would obviate the need for physical entry that puts troops or civilian response teams at risk. Part of a military brief called the Fast Lightweight Autonomy program, the study is looking at developing new algorithms to allow a small UAV operating without a remote pilot and without use of GPS waypoints to navigate stairways, corridors and other obstacles. ""Birds of prey and flying insects exhibit the kinds of capabilities we want for small UAVs,"" said Mark Micire, DARPA's Program Manager. ""Goshawks, for example, can fly very fast through a dense forest without smacking into a tree. ""Many insects, too, can dart and hover with incredible speed and precision. ""The goal of the FLA program is to explore non-traditional perception and autonomy methods that would give small UAVs the capacity to perform in a similar way, including an ability to easily navigate tight spaces at high speed and quickly recognize if it had already been in a room before."" Ultimately, the agency says the algorithms developed in the program could enhance other types of unmanned missions, including underwater environments where GPS systems don't work. ""Urban and disaster relief operations would be obvious key beneficiaries, but applications for this technology could extend to a wide variety of missions using small and large unmanned systems linked together with manned platforms as a system of systems,"" said Stephanie Tompkins, director of DARPA's Defense Sciences Office. The aim of the program would be to take the grunt work out of repetitive tasks where fatigue can mean the difference between life and death. ""By enabling unmanned systems to learn 'muscle memory' and perception for basic tasks like avoiding obstacles, it would relieve overload and stress on human operators so they can focus on supervising the systems and executing the larger mission."" Miniaturizing drones that could negotiate indoor environments has also been a focus of the U.S. military. Its Army Research Laboratory, known as ARL, in Adelphi, Maryland, are currently working on a project to develop robotic surveillance insects with wings just 3-5 centimeters in length. The wings are made of lead zirconium titanate, known as PZT, a material that flaps and bends when a small voltage is applied. ""We demonstrated that we can actually create lift,"" said Dr Ron Polcawich who heads the team. ""So we know this structure has the potential to fly."" Powered by tiny ultrasonic motors that measure just 2 to 3 millimeters, the team has also designed a millipede-like robot that simulates crawling when voltage is applied to the PZT material. While the team has shown that the project works in principle, Polcawich said that it may take a further 10-15 years of research before the Army has a fully functional robotic surveillance insect. He said that more research would be needed to establish algorithms that would allow a robotic insect to stabilize itself. More collaboration with other institutions -- Harvard University, for instance, has a ""robo-fly"" project three-times larger than the ARL's robotic insect -- would be necessary to make a fully working prototype. Polcawich said the smaller the mechanical device, the more intricate are its aerodynamic problems. In a gust of wind a fly ""doesn't instantaneously stabilize itself,"" Polcawich said. ""It will tumble, tumble, and then stabilize itself."" Creating this type of artificial intelligence or ""cognitive ability"" would take time, he said, and a number of different systems must be integrated to develop a robot that functions like an insect.

"(CNN)Like anyone with an Instagram account, I've been captivated in recent weeks by the insane-and-pioneering efforts of two men attempting to free climb a vertical rock face at Yosemite National Park. On Wednesday, the climbers, Kevin Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell, became the first people in the world to free climb the ""Dawn Wall"" route of Yosemite's El Capitan face. It's a path marked by ""pebble-size holds,"" according to the New York Times, so sharp they'll make your fingers bleed. Like, literally will make your fingers bleed. Check out this photo from Jorgeson's Instagram account. He reportedly sanded and super-glued the ends of his fingers to try to make them strong enough to grip the nearly sheer face of rock. It's one of the hardest climbing routes in the world. Which is why Jorgeson and Caldwell, who started the journey on December 27, and who slept in tents tacked to the vertical face, could be forgiven for thinking that they ""conquered"" this route, or this mountain. But, thankfully, that's not how they see it. Here's what Jorgeson had to say on Twitter: . It's about ""realizing a dream."" Competing with yourself. Achieving the impossible. Being struck by the awesomeness of nature, as it's clear the pair often were, based on their social media posts. But certainly not about ""conquering"" it. That's a refreshing opinion in the age of fracking and mountain-top removal. We live in a culture that tends to nature as a thing to be subverted and used, not respected. Jorgeson and Caldwell's epic ascent of the Dawn Wall should be a reminder of how small we humans are in the face of the natural world -- and also of how much we tiny humans can accomplish with enough hard work. The problem is that most of our efforts are misplaced. Rather than seeking to understand and explore the many uncharted parts of the world -- the 95% of the ocean that is unseen by humans, for example -- we extract capital. We drill deeper wells into the ground, sucking out water at such an unsustainable rate that California's Central Valley is sinking. Elsewhere, we inject wastewater into the land as part of the process of pulling out oil and natural gas. These injections, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, contribute to earthquakes in odd places like Oklahoma. We've turned farms into factories. Animals are bigger-fatter-tastier products, not living things. Or, worse, they're status symbols, as in illegal rhino horn or pangolin meat. The drop in the price of oil has slowed some efforts to go after the hardest-to-get energy sources, like oil hidden below the ocean floor, and underneath more than a mile of water. But it hasn't changed this ethic -- this core belief, which you can link back to the Bible if you wish, that humans have ""dominion"" over the world, that it's ours to rule and/or plunder as we choose. There are, however, signs this mindset is changing. New theories suggest we can and should live in partnership with the natural world -- removing dams from rivers, and letting them run free into the flood plain; harnessing energy from the wind, not from deep beneath the ocean. The Patagonia documentary ""DamNation"" gives a sense of this seismic shift. The Yosemite climbers offer hope, as well. ""Free climbs are puzzles,"" wrote Andrew Bisharat for National Geographic. ""The harder the movements get -- twisting, stretching, lunging, swinging, dangling -- the more painstaking the process of solving the puzzle becomes."" The world is a puzzle to be solved -- an adventure to be had. The rest of us would benefit from seeing it that way, too.","Rock climbers complete one of the world's most difficult routes .

"(CNN)Texas Gov. Rick Perry struck a moderate tone in a farewell address to the Texas legislature that could very well double as a presidential stump speech if the potential 2016 contender eventually decides to jump in the race. Perry, a conservative favorite that fell largely off the map following his failed and blundering 2012 presidential run, mixed concrete details on Texas' economic strength under his watch with sweeping comments about the ""endless possibilities"" in his state. He tacked to the center in the speech, touting his accomplishments greening Texas and striking a compassionate note on drug and alcohol addiction. And in comments that may just as well have been directed at the GOP as a whole, Perry declared: ""Compromise is not a dirty word if it moves Texas forward."" ""Do not place purity ahead of unity,"" he added. Despite the largely moderate tone, however, he threw red meat to conservatives on immigration, framing Texas as the last stand for a nation beset by threats from its neighbor to the South. ""Texas has done more to secure the border than any other state in the nation — and as long as Washington will not secure the border, Texas will be up more than up to the task,"" he promised. Perry also outlined economic accomplishments under his watch, including a budget surplus and billions left in a rainy day fund, and touted his efforts to make Texas a cultural hub. With 14 years under his belt, Perry leaves office the state's longest-serving governor, and Texas' economic and cultural strength under his watch would be a key factor in his presidential pitch if he decides to make another bid for the White House. He's made no secret of his interest, and will join a handful of his potential opponents — including 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney — in speaking to the Republican National Committee's winter meeting this week. During his Thursday speech to the legislature, Perry offered a taste of what his presidential stump speech could look like, offering sweeping rhetoric about the promise of Texas that could've easily been referencing the country as a whole. Speaking about the crises that have battered the state during his tenure, including multiple hurricanes, the border crisis and Ebola, he declared that ""each time Texans have responded to these tests with great character."" ""As long as there has been a Texas, there has existed a people whose character has been refined by fire, whose souls are resilient, who respond to tragedy with grace, who look to the future with hope — what we have done together is preserve Texas as a land of opportunity,"" Perry added.","Texas Gov.

"PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- A highly decorated Green Beret, Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth died a painful death in Iraq this year. He died not on the battlefield. He died in what should have been one of the safest spots in Iraq: on a U.S. base, in his bathroom. Ryan Maseth, a 24-year-old Green Beret, died in his shower January 2. The water pump was not properly grounded, and when he turned on the shower, a jolt of electricity shot through his body and electrocuted him January 2. The next day, Cheryl Harris was informed of his death. A mother of three sons serving in Iraq, she had feared such news might come one day. ""I did ask exactly, 'How did Ryan die? What happened to him?' And he had told me that Ryan was electrocuted,"" she said. Her reaction was disbelief. ""I truly couldn't believe he would be electrocuted ... in the shower,"" she said. Maseth, 24, was not the first. At least 12 U.S. troops have been electrocuted in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003, according to military and government officials.  Watch mom describe horror, heartbreak over son's electrocution » . In fact, the Army issued a bulletin in 2004 warning that electrocution was ""growing at an alarming rate."" It said five soldiers died that year by electrocution, with improper grounding the likely culprit in each case. The Army bulletin detailed one soldier's death in a shower -- eerily similar to Maseth's case -- that said he was found ""lying on a shower room floor with burn marks on his body."" Maseth's mother says the Army was not immediately forthcoming with details about her son's death. At one point, she says, the Army told her he had a small appliance with him in the shower on his base, a former palace complex near the Baghdad airport. ""It just created so much doubt, and I know Ryan, I know Ryan, I know how he was trained, I know that he would not have been in a shower with a small appliance and electrocuted himself,"" she said.  Watch ""I can't make sense around Ryan's death"" » . The Army refused to answer CNN's questions about the case, citing pending litigation by Maseth's family. Maseth's mother says she pressed the military for answers, eventually uncovering more details about her son's electrocution. The surging current left burn marks across his body, even singeing his hair. Army reports show that he probably suffered a long, painful death. Fellow soldiers had to break down the door to help, said Patrick Cavanaugh, an attorney for Maseth's parents. ""When they kicked down the door, they smelled burning hair, and they rushed over, saw Sgt. Maseth lying there unconscious, and one of the rescuers himself was shocked electrically and sustained a fairly good jolt because the water and the pipes were still electrified,"" Cavanaugh said. Army documents obtained by CNN show that U.S.-paid contractor Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) inspected the building and found serious electrical problems a full 11 months before Maseth was electrocuted. KBR noted ""several safety issues concerning the improper grounding of electrical devices."" But KBR's contract did not cover ""fixing potential hazards."" It covered repairing items only after they broke down. Only after Maseth died did the Army issue an emergency order for KBR to finally fix the electrical problems, and that order was carried out soon thereafter. In an internal e-mail obtained by CNN, a Navy captain admits that the Army should have known ""the extent of the severity of the electrical problems."" The e-mail then says the reason the Army did not know was because KBR's inspections were never reviewed by a ""qualified government employee."" Larraine McGee is the mother of Sgt. Christopher Everett, another soldier electrocuted in Iraq. ""The impression I got was that this was the first time that it had happened,"" McGee said. Her son was cleaning a Humvee on his Iraqi base with a power washer that was not properly grounded in 2005. ""I thought Chris was the first and that because of that, they were going to correct the problem, and it wasn't going to happen again,"" she said. When she learned of Maseth's electrocution, she was stunned. ""It makes me very angry, because there is no reason for this to be going on,"" said McGee. The electrocution of soldiers is prompting anger in Washington. ""How did this happen?"" asked Rep. Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Oversight Committee. Waxman has called for an investigation. ""Why wasn't it corrected when we had the first signs that people were dying from electrocutions?"" In a statement to CNN, the U.S. Department of Defense said it ""considers this to be a serious issue and has referred it to the DoD Inspector General's office for action."" The Defense Department said that there are nearly 40,000 structures and housing units in the Iraqi theater and that ""we believe there was adequate oversight of the KBR contractors."" ""In the past 12 months, KBR performed over 2 million service or work order repairs across the theater,"" the Defense Department said. It went on to say that the Pentagon has ""no information"" that personnel with Defense Contract Management Agency, which handles the KBR contract, was aware of the 2004 Army bulletin or that they ""failed to take appropriate action in response to unsafe conditions brought to our attention."" The Defense Department inspector general's office said it could not comment on the new investigation at this time.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Some answers may be revealed in blood-stained halls or deep in the rubble of Nairobi's Westgate Mall. Others may never be known. That's the reality for investigators and the people of Kenya on Wednesday, still coming to grips with a vicious attack and armed standoff that ended a day earlier. At least 61 civilians and six Kenyan security officers died in the four-day attack and rescue efforts, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Tuesday, but the death toll will rise as recovery workers retrieve bodies buried in the rubble of the partially collapsed mall. Kenyan forces killed five terrorists, and 11 others are in custody over possible links to the attacks, Kenyatta said, declaring that his country had ""ashamed and defeated"" the attackers. But even though Kenyatta declared the siege over, an immense amount of work remains to learn how Al-Shabaab, a terror group thought to be badly bruised by recent losses in its Somalian homeland, was able to pull off such a well-coordinated and brazen attack. President: Mall siege attackers 'ashamed and defeated' How did they do it? It started Saturday when the attackers stormed into the upscale mall and began shooting. A senior Kenyan government official said they took ""very few"" people captive; the attackers were primarily out for blood. ""They were not interested in hostage-taking,"" the official said. ""They only wanted to kill."" The attackers were equipped well enough to kill dozens of civilians, then fend off Kenyan security forces for four days -- not the sort of action that can be pulled off on a whim. That raises a number of questions: How could such a significant plot, involving travel arrangements, arms transfers and other details, have escaped the attention of intelligence officials? Did the attackers have inside help, either at the mall or within security forces? So far, Kenyan and U.S. authorities aren't answering such questions, certainly not publicly. Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness . U.S. wants access . U.S. security and law enforcement personnel are pressing for access to the mall and the bodies of the terrorists so they can begin to determine if Americans were among the attackers, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the situation. ""That is the million-dollar question,"" the official said. ""We do not have much fidelity on this. We haven't had access to the scene."" But based on what the United States knows so far, ""this was meticulously planned,"" the official said. ""This is not something where the attackers walked into the mall all of the sudden."" The United States is looking at the possibility the attackers stored their weapons inside the mall ahead of time and may have even rented a store there as a base of operations. The Americans are also looking at reports the attackers may have had access to blueprints of the mall and knowledge of the location of employee and service personnel stairways as well as ventilation systems. FBI experts from the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center are assisting Kenyans on a preliminary basis. They have specific expertise in analyzing explosives and fingerprints. But the United States wants autopsy and forensic data, including DNA samples, to help determine if Americans were involved, the official said. The United States also will scour any communications or intercepts for clues, according to other officials. American experts also will try to analyze any evidence of grenades and heavy belt-fed machine guns being used, the official said. He noted grenade attacks by Al-Shabaab are fairly common. The U.S. belief so far is that Al-Shabaab hard-line leader Ahmed Abdi Godane ordered the attack, the official said. ""Nothing like this would have gotten off the ground without him. It's safe to assume this is something he would have blessed,"" the official said. Who were the attackers? Kenyan authorities have said 10 to 15 attackers were believed to be involved. One attacker was Dutch and another British, Kenya State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu told CNN on Wednesday. Al-Shabaab previously had said Americans were involved in the attack, a claim Kenyatta also noted Tuesday but said has not been verified. Esipisu said Wednesday that Kenyan authorities believe attackers of ""a few other nationalities"" were involved. Kenyan Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku told reporters Wednesday that authorities cannot confirm the nationalities of the terrorists until forensic testing is complete. He said the United States, Israel, Britain, Germany and Canada are helping in the mall forensic investigation. Somali jihadists recruit in United States, Canada and Europe . Reports that a white woman was among the terrorists who stormed the mall have prompted a slew of media speculation about Samantha Lewthwaite, a British woman whose husband was one of the suicide bombers in the 2005 London terror attacks. Known as the ""White Widow,"" Lewthwaite has been wanted by international counterterrorism officials since authorities found bomb-making materials in her Mombasa, Kenya, apartment in 2011. She vanished shortly before a raid. Was the ""White Widow"" involved? A senior Kenyan official said Tuesday a woman was involved in the attack. Esipisu said Wednesday that authorities can't say much about who the woman was or what she was doing. ""What we've been told by multiple witnesses is that they saw a woman. We have also been told that if it is the same woman that they say they saw, that she would have been killed very early on in the attack,"" Esipisu said. ""We don't know for sure that we had a woman. And secondly, because of the bodies trapped under the rubble, we don't know if she is who everyone says she might be."" Where are they? Some of them are dead, inside the rubble of the partially collapsed mall, Kenyatta said. But while he said five terrorists had been killed by Kenyan forces and 11 people were in custody, it was not clear if all the attackers had been accounted for, or if some may have been able to slip out in the chaos. A senior Kenyan official said forces were able to drive two attackers trying to escape by car back inside the mall, but it's unclear if any others might have been able to elude authorities early in the crisis. Others could have escaped by posing as civilians, perhaps after ditching weapons and changing clothes. How to help . On Wednesday, a high-level source who asked for anonymity told CNN that Kenyan counterterrorism police had arrested a British national of Somali descent who had injuries on his face and was acting suspiciously as he tried to board a Turkish Airlines flight. It's not clear if Kenyan authorities suspect the man of being inside the mall during the attack, but authorities found they had no record of the man's entry into the country, the source said. There is conflicting information on the man. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office told CNN the detained man is not connected to the terrorist attack. The office did not say how it knew that man was not involved and declined to elaborate. Kenyatta, whose country boasts deep counterterrorism ties to the United States, vowed to track down and punish the attack's perpetrators. ""These cowards will meet justice, as will their accomplices and patrons wherever they are,"" the Kenyan leader said Tuesday. The Kenyan spirit cannot be broken, says eyewitness .

"(CNN)For most of us, a blood test begins with a needle, a syringe and the promise it will all be over quickly. But at the back end, testing blood often requires transporting the vial to a clinic, a range of laboratory equipment and trained clinicians and doctors to get an accurate result. The whole process can take days, and in some cases even weeks. But imagine if you could put the whole laboratory into a portable unit that delivered a reading immediately? One Irish company says it has developed the solution -- a ""clinic-in-a-box"" that can test for a range of diseases or medical conditions in minutes, from just a single drop of blood. ""The physicians were crying out for a simple-to-use device,"" Jerry O'Brien, a farmer's son from Cork who broke with the family tradition to pursue a career in healthcare, told CNN. ""There was a huge unmet clinical need. It was very obvious from the start they wanted a simple device that would test for any condition off a finger-prick of blood within a matter of minutes."" He said a quick look at the antiquated equipment often still used by laboratories immediately told him that there was a better mousetrap to be built. ""We looked at the gold standard piece of equipment, we opened the hood on it and inside there were vacuum tubes, technology from the 50s and 60s and that was the spark,"" O'Brien said. After six years of research and development, O'Brien's Cork-based company Radisens Diagnostics, came up with its Gemini prototype. Cartridges packed with tiny beads with a molecular coating specific to the disease that is being investigated are loaded into the machine. A drop of blood is spun with the beads and any disease molecules present in the blood sample appear in the form long chains. Analyzing these samples under a green light immediately shows how much of the disease is present in the sample. Doctors would be equipped with cartridges specific to the diseases they may be diagnosing; from heart or liver disease to diabetes. The device has multiple applications and can be used in remote locations where access to laboratory facilities is limited or even non-existent. One of its major investors has been the European Space Agency who are looking to use the device in space. ""(It would) give the European Space Agency a device for testing astronauts -- for testing not only there and then but tracking their physiology over their long stays in space in zero gravity,"" he said. One of the advantages of the system, said O'Brien, is that doctors can reinforce their medical advice with an instant diagnosis. ""If you can get the diagnostic or monitoring test there and then, the physician can look you in the eye and say ... you've not been managing your health, when you come back in three months' time, I want to see better test results.

"An Egypt-backed cease-fire between Israel and Hamas fell apart Tuesday as rocket attacks from Gaza were again answered by Israeli airstrikes. The rocket attacks from Hamas militants in Gaza never ceased, Israeli officials said. For its part, Israel refrained from airstrikes for about six hours before announcing it was resuming them. A CNN crew witnessed at least five Israeli strikes just as the announcement was made. ""Hamas closed the diplomatic option. We woke up this morning in the hope there'd be a cease-fire and, as you reported, Israel restrained from all our activities, all action against terrorists in Gaza for a full six hours. We gave this cease-fire our full support,"" Mark Regev, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" ""But Hamas said no to everyone. Hamas said no to the cease-fire, both in word and in deed,"" Regev said. The faltering of the cease-fire attempt means there may be little hope of seeing an end to the near constant exchange of fire that has so far killed more than 190 Palestinians in Gaza. The first fatality on the Israeli side was a man killed Monday after being hit by a mortar shell, Israeli Rescue Services said. He was an Israeli volunteer who was at the Erez border crossing to deliver food to soldiers. Israeli leaders had agreed to the cease-fire, but from the outset warned it would be short-lived if the attacks from Gaza didn't stop. The Israeli Security Cabinet met early Tuesday morning and decided to halt aerial strikes beginning at 9 a.m. (2 a.m. ET). It resumed strikes about six hours later, by 3 p.m. (8 a.m. ET). Gaza crisis: Who's who in Hamas . The barrage from Gaza continued, with more than 140 rockets fired from there since early Tuesday -- or one rocket every six minutes -- according to the IDF. ""Hamas have decided to continue, and will pay the price for that decision,"" Netanyahu said Tuesday. His Security Cabinet met again late in the day for emergency talks. The Egyptian plan calls for all sides to cease hostilities in Gaza. It also calls for the opening of border crossings, once the security situation is stable, and for high-level talks among those involved. ""The achievement of the success of this Egyptian effort is a must for all of us,"" said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat. ""It's an interest for all of us, and if we allow things to deteriorate I think it's going to be a disaster all over."" He continued: ""Failure is not an option here."" When the plan was announced, there was a split reaction from Hamas. Its military wing rejected any possibility of a cease-fire, while its political wing had said it was considering it. Ismail Haneyya, deputy chairman of Hamas' political wing, said at the outset of the Egyptian efforts that there is a bigger issue than a cease-fire for Palestinians. He said that what Palestinians really want is an end to the Israeli blockade on Gaza that is suffocating the daily lives of the 1.8 million Palestinians living there. Haneyya, speaking on Hamas-owned Al Aqsa TV, also accused Israel of not freeing Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, as had been agreed to under an earlier truce. These, he said, are elements the Palestinians would like to see in a comprehensive cease-fire agreement. Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan later stressed that Hamas never received the proposal through political channels. ""We are still working with Egypt. We are still talking to other sides,"" he told CNN. ""I believe a proposal is supposed to be prepared after the sides agree on it.  It's supposed to be published if two sides give agreement on it. You can't publish it in the media and then ask everyone to accept that or reject that."" Asked why Hamas won't stop firing rockets while talks are ongoing, the spokesman replied: ""We are not the side who is killing the other side. We are are the side being killed."" Trapped in war: 'This is tyranny' Civilian casualties . The stakes are high and climbing. By Tuesday, the death toll from a week of Israeli airstrikes on Gaza had reached 194, with at least 1,400 wounded, according to Palestinian health authorities. The toll is now greater than the number of people killed in Gaza during the 2012 conflict between Israel and Hamas. The United Nations has said that most of the people killed by Israel's aerial attacks are civilians. ""I urgently call on the Israeli Security Forces to put an end to attacks against, or endangering, civilians and civilian infrastructure which are contrary to international humanitarian law,"" said Pierre Krahenbuhl, commissioner general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA. There are now 17,000 refugees taking shelter in 20 schools in Gaza, UNRWA said, and the airstrikes have damaged 47 of its buildings, including clinics, schools and warehouses. The Israeli military says it uses a variety of methods, including phone calls and leaflets, to warn civilians of impending strikes. ""As part of our effort to avoid harming civilians, we are sending messages to residents of northern Gaza to leave homes for their own safety,"" the IDF posted to Twitter late Tuesday. But UNRWA called on Israel to exercise maximum restraint and precautions to avoid more casualties. ""Clearly, at this stage not enough is being done in that regard,"" Krahenbuhl said. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner accused Hamas of holding the people of Gaza hostage. ""They are using and abusing the houses, the infrastructure there, in order to carry out these attacks. We really don't have any other choice,"" he said. Hamas on Tuesday closed a crossing between Gaza and Israel but allowed 25 Palestinians -- some of them needing medical attention -- to cross into Israel at Erez. The border crossing at Erez was closed not as punitive measure, but because the Gazan side has been targeted in airstrikes, said Maher Abu Subha, the head of the committee for border crossings in Gaza. Employees at the crossing have been targeted three times in three days, and it was closed out of fear for the lives of the workers, he said. The crossing can be reopened quickly if Israel can guarantee the workers' safety, he said. Kerry delays trip . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was preparing a possible trip to the Middle East to lay groundwork for a cease-fire, but he postponed the visit to give Egyptian efforts a chance to take root. One official said the United States wants to give Egypt a chance to reassert itself as a power broker in the Middle East, as it did during the 2012 cease-fire. Kerry continued to follow that line Tuesday. ""The Egyptian proposal for a cease-fire and negotiations provides an opportunity to end the violence and restore calm,"" Kerry said from Vienna, Austria. ""We welcome the Israeli Cabinet's decision to accept it. We urge all other parties to accept the proposal."" Kerry strongly condemned the rocket launches by Hamas in the face of the cease-fire plan, and said he is prepared to fly to the Middle East as early as Wednesday, if needed. The current Egyptian President, the ex-military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has weaker relations with Hamas than former President Mohamed Morsy, who brokered the 2012 deal. Morsy was ousted by the military in 2013. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will travel to Egypt on Wednesday to meet with the President and to discuss a possible cease-fire, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported. Abbas also is scheduled to visit Turkey. Earlier, Kerry spoke by phone with Netanyahu and expressed U.S. concerns about escalating tensions. He reiterated that the United States is prepared to help bring about a cease-fire, a senior State Department official said. But ""offering facilitation is not enough,"" Yousef Munayyer of the Washington-based Palestine Center told CNN's ""New Day."" ""It's important that the United States demand a cease-fire,"" he said.
