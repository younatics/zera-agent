Hamilton staring at a 29-point deficit to Rosberg, he knows he cannot . afford for that gap to grow any larger heading into his home event where . a crowd of 125,000 is expected on Sunday. Two retirements this campaign have proved expensive for Hamilton, in contrast to Rosberg who has not been out of the top two in the eight races to date. Hamilton, though, has no intention of relying on any misfortune to Rosberg to aid his cause. Asked of Hamilton whether he was a believer in situations balancing themselves out and that Rosberg was due a couple of retirements, he replied: 'I'm not convinced that's the case. 'That would mean in the next 11 races Nico would need to have two he does not finish, and I do not think that is going to happen. 'I cannot rely on that, I just have to focus on doing better than him, which I am capable of. 'The edge I have is in my ability.

I earned my money, so that was good,"" said Hamilton, who was runner-up behind Rosberg. 'I know I'm 29 points down now, but even though I've not finished as many races as I would like and I lost another seven points to Nico in Austria, there's still a long way to go.

'I had a lot of pace in Austria, and although I didn't capitalise on it, I'll take it into the British Grand Prix and make sure I do. 'I'm excited about our pace. I'm going to Silverstone with the best package I've ever had, so I'm thrilled about that . 'I just have to execute that pace over a weekend, so I will work hard to make sure I do that.""It could be argued Hamilton is due at least some luck bearing in mind what occurred in last year's grand prix.

"Jenson Button will surprisingly start from third on the grid in an emotional British Grand Prix during which he – and thousands of fans in pink shirts – will pay tribute to his father John, a popular motor-racing figure who died suddenly earlier this year. The McLaren racer will don a pink helmet and has urged fans to wear the colour, which John sported as his ‘lucky’ race-day shirt. The proceeds from the sale of the specially-designed t-shirts will go to the Henry Surtees Foundation, a brain trauma charity that was established in memory of former world champion John Surtees’s son who died on track.

He’s definitely smiling down today. ‘This was probably dad’s favourite race because it reminded him of the karting days when it was father and son, just us trying to beat the world. ‘We came here camping in ’94 across the road from the entrance, in a caravan, and I remember the toilets being horrendous. ‘To come back here and to see his son race in a Formula One car meant a lot to him.

"A San Francisco Bay Area woman was sentenced to more than 16 years in prison for running what prosecutors said was a sham university that served as a front for an immigration scam. Susan Xiao-Ping Su, founder and president of the phony Tri-Valley University in Pleasanton, was accused of charging foreigners tuition and other payments for visa-related documents that allowed them to live in the U.S. while she purported that they were here legally to study. She made more than $5.6 million and used the money to buy commercial real estate, a Mercedes Benz and multiple homes, including one at a golf club, federal prosecutors said Monday. Scammer: Susan Xiao-Ping Su, was sentenced to more than 16 years in prison for running what prosecutors said was a sham university that served as a front for an immigration scam . Scandal: In the Tri-Valley case, employees testified that the school had no graduation and admission requirements, and that Su instructed her staff to fabricate transcripts and other documents . U.S. District Court Judge Jon S. Tigar sentenced Su, 44, on Friday after she was convicted in March of visa fraud and other charges. She was also ordered to forfeit $5.6 million and pay more than $900,000 in restitution, prosecutors said. 'Student visas are intended to give people from around the world a chance to come to this country to enrich themselves with the vast learning opportunities available here,' Tatum King, acting special agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigations, San Francisco, said in a statement. 'But in this case, the defendant was interested in a different kind of enrichment, her own.' The Tri-Valley case is not unique in the Bay Area. Scheme: Su allegedly paid recruiters for referring new students . Jerry Wang, the chief executive officer of Herguan University and the University of East-West Medicine in Sunnyvale, is also facing visa fraud charges in connection with what authorities say is a similar scheme. He has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go on trial next month. In the Tri-Valley case, employees testified that the school had no graduation and admission requirements, and that Su instructed her staff to fabricate transcripts and other documents. The school described itself as a 'Christian higher education institution' that provided higher education in engineering, business and ministry, according to court documents.

"A Harvard University student, 21, accused of making a bomb threat to get out of a final exam may avoid federal prosecution. The U.S. attorney's office asked a judge to defer Eldo Kim's prosecution to allow him to undergo a pretrial diversion program. The arrangement requires the 21-year-old to serve four months of home confinement, pay restitution to agencies that responded to the alleged threat, complete 750 hours of community service and publicly apologize. May avoid prosecution: Eldo Kim, pictured leaving the Federal Courthouse by a side door last year, may avoid federal prosecution . Possible pretrial diversion: The arrangement requires the 21-year-old to serve four months of home confinement, pay restitution to agencies that responded to the alleged threat, complete 750 hours of community service and give a public apology . Federal prosecutors announced on Friday they charged Kim in what's called a criminal information with emailing several bomb threats to offices associated with the university nearly 10 months ago. He previously was charged in a criminal complaint. The government would drop charges if the court agrees to defer Kim's prosecution and he successfully abides by all the terms of pretrial diversion. Kim was freed on $100,000 bond after making an initial court appearance in December of last year. Eldo Kim's attorney, Ian Gold, said his client was under a great deal of pressure and seems to regret his actions. ‘He’s a very remorseful, shattered young man,’ Gold said. The exam fell on the third anniversary of his father's death. Under the conditions of his release, he cannot enter Harvard’s campus without prior approval of Harvard and the federal court, other than to retrieve his belongings with an escort. Mr Gold, a federal public defender, said Kim was dealing with the pressure of finals and the third anniversary of the death of his father, a professor at a South Korean university. Made a bomb threat: Federal prosecutors on Friday announced they charged Kim in an information with emailing several bomb threats to offices associated with the university nearly 10 months ago . According to the lawyer, Kim became a naturalized U.S. citizen in fifth grade and renounced his South Korean citizenship. Kim, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, has been charged with sending the electronic threats to multiple offices associated with the Ivy League university. Kim confessed to sending the emails from an anonymous address in order to get out of taking an exam, according to court documents. The missives falsely warned there were 'shrapnel bombs placed in science center, sever hall, emerson hall, thayer hall, 2/4. guess correctly. be quick for they will go off soon.' The subject line of the emails read 'bombs placed around campus.' An undated Harvard University bio page lists an Eldo Kim in the department of psychology . He lists his graduation date as 2016 in an article he wrote in April for the Harvard Independent. He also performed with the Harvard Breakers dance troupe. If he were convicted, he could face a maximum of five years in prison an a fine of $250,000. Kim attended Kamiak High School, graduating in June 2012, Andy Muntz, a spokesman for the Mukilteo School District, said Wednesday. While there, Kim was a National Merit Scholarship finalist and participated on the tennis and debate teams, Muntz said. Authorities said Kim told them he emailed the bomb threats about a half-hour before he was scheduled to take a final in Emerson Hall. He said he was there at 9 a.m. when he heard the alarm sound and knew his plan had worked, according to an FBI affidavit. On Saturday night before the exam, Kim sent an email over his dorm Listserv, The Harvard Crimson reported. After the threat: Police scoured the area  and looked for bombs after the student sent out the bomb threat . Under pressure: Kim's lawyer has said that Eldo Kim didn't want to take the exam on the third anniversary of his father's death and that he was under extreme pressure . ‘I was wondering if anyone had taken GOV 1368: The Politics of American Education (Paul Peterson) in the past,’ Kim wrote in the email. ‘I have several quick questions about the course.’ As a sophomore at Kamiak, Kim was a National Peace Essay Contest winner with other students nationwide, a program sponsored by the federally-funded United States Institute of Peace, whose mission is to 'increase the nation's capacity to manage international conflict without violence . His contest biography described him as a member of varsity tennis and the swim team, as well as the debate team. ‘Eldo is also a member of National Honor Society and tutors students in mathematics. He is enrolled in the Seattle Conservatory of Music and plays the viola,’ the biography said. Kim also was described as a voluntary research assistant for a professor at Korea University, and has assisted in the development of a model for public acceptance of the management of radioactive waste. ‘During the summer of 2008, he traveled with fellow high school students to Peru and rebuilt rural communities,’ the biography said. ‘He enjoys writing and competing in sports. Eldo plans to major in Political Science and is excited for what the future holds in the coming years.’ Two hours after threats were sent to officials and the Harvard Crimson newspaper, authorities had already decided they were likely a hoax. Investigators from several agencies searched the buildings for hours before determining there were no explosives. One of the buildings was a freshman dormitory; classes are held in the other three. In a statement to the Harvard community, Harvard Executive Vice President Katie Lapp said that the buildings were evacuated ‘out of an abundance of caution’ and that activities at the Ivy League school in Cambridge were returning to normal. ‘I am relieved to report that no suspicious devices were found,’ Lapp said in her statement.

"Former Fulham captain Brede Hangeland has launched a scathing attack on manager Felix Magath. Norwegian defender Hangeland claims the management style of the German, who took over at Craven Cottage in February, actually contributed to their relegation last season. The 33-year-old also feels Magath is not the right man to lead Fulham to promotion next term. VIDEO Scroll down to see Magath say he only wants players that are committed to the club . Under fire: Magath has been heavily criticised by his former captain Hangeland . Hangeland told Sky Sports News: 'He's very difficult to work with. 'He's a very strict manager and his main tool is to try to mentally and physically batter his players and hopefully get some results out of that. 'Is that the right fit for English football? I don't think so. I thought rather than help us try to avoid relegation he made things worse. 'I hope I'm wrong but I don't think he is the right man (to get Fulham promoted) and things will get worse before they get better.' Tough regime: Hangeland hit out at Magath's style of management and said he would not win promotion . Hangeland left Craven Cottage under a cloud this summer after six-and-a-half years in west London, and last month revealed he only found out he was being released from his contract via email. But the player added he would have been willing to stay with the Cottagers in the Championship had he received assurances about the future direction of the club. He said: 'With the right signs and the right players coming in I would have been prepared to stay. 'There was a release clause in my contract which they decided to take. I would have hoped for at least (to have been told) face-to-face or a pat on the back after six-and-a-half years.' Fulham have since insisted that 'all personal protocol was followed' when Hangeland was informed of his release.

"Liverpool have snapped up 20-year-old defender Kevin Stewart, who was released by Tottenham this summer. But, having announced the move on Twitter himself, no-one seems to know that much about the player. Here, Sportsmail reveals all... What happened at Spurs for them to let him go? He signed as a full-time scholar in 2010 when he turned 16 and joined the club with a lot of promise. Youth coaches there had high hopes that he'd push on and break through into the senior team. That was why he was called into first-team squads as a teenager, making the bench for a Europa League game against PAOK in 2011. Move: Kevin Stewart was released by Tottenham in the summer but has signed for Liverpool . Was there any attitude problem there then? Not at all, by the sounds of it. One source who knows the player said: 'He was popular amongst his age group and very polite. There were never any issues there, he got on with everyone.' But why have Liverpool picked up a player deemed not good enough for Spurs? The key link in all this is Liverpool's Under 21 coach Alex Inglethorpe, who used to be a youth coach at... Spurs. Inglethorpe was at the north London club from 2006-2012 when Brendan Rodgers signed him as part of his coaching staff. It is thought that Inglethorpe has been instrumental in the signing of Stewart. Tweet: 20-year-old defender Stewart took to Twitter to announce the deal himself . Dream come true: Kevin Stewart wearing a Liverpool strip as a kid as he mentioned in his tweet . What's he like as a player? Stewart has been described by those who know him as 'energetic' and 'a solid defender' who very rarely makes mistakes but can lapse in concentration at times. He can play across the back, on the left or right flank or as a centre half. Last season, wearing the No 59 shirt, he was used predominantly as a centre-back. He is 5ft 7ins, so not exactly the tallest of players, and his height would suggest he is more suited to full-back. Run: Stewart can play on the left, right or in the centre, even though he isn't the tallest at 5ft 7ins . Strength: Stewart is known as 'energetic' and a 'solid defender' that has potential to get better . Did he achieve anything at Spurs? Stewart was part of the Spurs squad who won the Under 21 Southern League three years ago and was also a regular in the side who beat Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the 2011/12 Next Gen competition. That will have been another occasion when he came under Liverpool's radar. Earlier in the tournament they also smashed Inter Milan 7-1, with Stewart in the side.

"A teenage boy who shot his girlfriend dead on his birthday has been sentenced to nine years' detention for her manslaughter. Shereka Fab-Ann Marsh, 15, was hit in the neck by a single bullet from a fake 1930s Italian Beretta pistol which the boy was looking after in a mire of 'violent gang confrontation', a court heard. The 15-year-old boy - who cannot be named due to his age - was cleared of murder after jurors hears he loved Shereka and fired the gun by accident. Killed: Shereka Fab-Ann Marsh, 15, died after being hit by a single bullet shot by her boyfriend. The boy who shot her, who cannot be named, was jailed for nine years for manslaughter today after being cleared of murder . Weapon: The court heard the boy was asked to look after this gun in the context of 'violent gang confrontation' But the jury convicted him of manslaughter and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. Judge Charles Wide told the Old Bailey it was plain from the evidence that he had been pointing the gun at Shereka to 'frighten' her. And the circumstances in which he had the gun and ammunition in the first place were in the context of 'violent gang confrontation', the judge said. The judge told the boy: 'Having come into possession of the gun and ammunition plainly in the context of being asked to look after it ... you then got it out. 'I have no doubt at all you pointed it at Shereka and pulled the trigger to frighten her and you shot her dead.' Defence: The boy insisted the gun went off by accident and he had no reason to hurt his girlfriend (pictured) During the trial, the boy insisted that he loved his girlfriend and had no reason to hurt her. After the gun went off in the bedroom of a house in Hackney, east London, the boy phoned 999 but she was pronounced dead later that afternoon. On his arrest at the house, the boy told officers it was 'an accident' and exclaimed: 'Am I going to hell?' Later he said: 'My girl died on my birthday.' Police later found two pictures of him posing with handguns on his mobile phone, one of which was pointing at the person who took the photograph. Grief: Shereka's mother Shyrine Mills, pictured outside court, said in a statement: 'Guns are not toys' Soon after the shooting, the boy said he and his girlfriend were sitting on the bed and holding the gun together to feel how heavy it was. But he changed his story and admitted in court that he had been standing in front of her, waving the gun around with both hands, not thinking it was loaded. The defendant also initially claimed to have found the gun on Hackney Marshes, but later said he had been given it to hide for a man in his 20s - who he refused to name. Today, Judge Wide told the boy that he observed he had behaved with 'quite remarkable coolness' while describing in court how he shot his girlfriend . He also took account of his previous violent behaviour - two convictions for robbery, one armed with a screwdriver. The court heard that the boy had been excluded from school three times, twice for violence. A text message referring to 'shanks' - thought to mean homemade knives - showed he had been involved in an incident of violence in the past, the judge said. The youth had previously pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition but was not sentenced separately for those offences. Shereka's family were in court as her killer was sent down to begin his sentence without showing any emotion. Her mother Shyrine Mills issued a statement saying: 'Guns are not toys'. 'Shereka's life was tragically cut short because of the negligent actions by one of her peers who took it upon himself to involve himself in activities that no child should ever be involved with,' she added. 'Guns are not toys and should only be handled by trained professionals in extreme circumstances. 'Shereka and the defendant should be in school preparing for their GCSEs, and we all should have been going about our normal daily business, while the courts deal with hardened criminals.' In court the boy admitted he had held the weapon (pictured) in front of Shereka and waved it with both hands . Deadly: The bullets found after the shooting of Shereka Marsh.

Masterpieces of engineering, these wind tunnels at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in the small town of Farnborough, Hampshire, were the testing grounds for Britain's earliest aircraft. The country's best aeronautical engineers flocked to the Pyestock National Gas Turbine Establishment at the RAE to build and test generations of aircraft in the hangars that now lie silent and disused. Awe-inspiring: The wind tunnels at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough, Hampshire, were where prototypes for Britain's earliest aircraft were tested . The age of the wind tunnels is only given away by the odd outdated touch: These wooden fan prop blades now lie still in a vast, 24ft wide fan . History was made here: This shot looks like something out of a science fiction film, but is the Cell1 jet engine test area at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough . The R52 wind tunnel control room at the RAE site was at the cutting edge in its day  - now the control room looks more like a museum than the nerve centre it used to be . Testing ground: Britain's best aeronautical engineers built and tested generations of aircraft in the enormous hangars at Farnborough that now lie silent . Masterpiece of engineering: One can only imagine the noise, and the force of the wind produced when these 24ft fan blades were going at full blast . Tests for prototypes of early WWI biplanes, later aircraft including the Hurricane and Concorde, were carried out in these tunnels, as well as trials for atomic bomb casings and even Sir Malcolm Cambell’s record breaking speedboat. The structures, one built in 1916 and the other in 1934, stand as testament to the world leading engineering work carried out in the now disused buildings. Photographer Matthew Emmett captured a unique glimpse of the age-worn tunnels and surrounding buildings, which are currently closed to public view. Wooden fan blades, vintage control rooms and concrete air tunnels may give an outdated feeling to the engineering, but it was once at very the cutting edge of aircraft development. The huge fans would drive airflow around a series of 90 degree turns within the tunnels. They used a series of bladed fins to guide the air efficiently back around the loop and finally through a narrow aperture - where it was accelerated into the testing area. The site still functions today as Farnborough Airport, the headquarters for the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, and for defence use. To see more of Mr Emmett’s work, visit his Facebook page. Glimpse into Britain's aeronautical history: This is a balance mechanism within the tunnel where items were tested for aerodynamic efficiency; right: one of the fans . Looking more like something out of a Ridley Scott blockbuster, Cell 3 at the RAE actually lies in the Hampshire countryside at the National Gas Turbine Establishment . The buildings at the RAE are home to complex machinery and powerful structures - on the right is the blast nozzle of a supersonic engine test cell . This is the stunning and cavernous turbine hall, or air house, that powered the wind tunnels at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough . Vast machinery: Cell 4 was built to fly Concorde's Olympus jet engine at mach 2 and a lowered air pressure to simulate the conditions flying at 57,000ft . Rarely seen: The beautiful photographs of the wind tunnels, which closed in the 1960s and are hidden from public view, were taken by Matthew Emmett . A prototype of the Hawker Hurricane fighter plane, pictured above, was developed and trialled at the Royal Aircraft Establishment before it closed . The supersonic Concorde, pictured, was also developed and tested in the Farnborough wind tunnels under the guidance of the country's top aeronautical engineers .","Wind tunnels at Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough, Hampshire, were testing grounds for prototype planes .

"The 'sexy Ebola containment suit' is on sale online . Websites and bars appear to be cashing in on the Ebola crisis by selling costumes for Halloween, mocked up to look like a containment suit being worn by volunteers risking their own lives to treat people infected with the deadly disease. The costume - which is available in a male and female version - has appeared on the brands on sale website. A description of the suit says: 'As the deadly Ebola virus trickles its way through the United States, fighting its disease is no reason to compromise style.' The costume has gone on sale as flyers have been released advertising a 'Saturday Night Ebola Fever' Halloween event in London. Last night the WHO confirmed the number of people who had been infected with the disease had reached 10,000. Almost 5,000 people have so far died of Ebola, most from Africa and the WHO estimates the figure could be higher due to under reporting in Africa. The costumes, which are being sold for $59.99 (£37) come complete with a white costume dress, face shield, breathing mask, safety eye goggles and blue gloves. The site sells the lace up yellow boots separately for $79.99 (£49). The description adds: 'The short dress and chic gas mask will be the talk of Milan, London, Paris, and New York as the world's fashionistas seek global solutions to hazmat couture.' It says the male and female outfits are the perfect way for couples to dress up for Halloween parties. On the male version the website adds: 'This will literally be the most ""viral"" costume of the year.' The Scotch of St James, a music venue in Mayfair in London, is due to hold an event called Saturday Night Ebola Fever for Halloween weekend. Flyers and a Facebook invite, complete with a banner with Halloween-themed writing, have been released - drawing criticism from charities attempting to deal with the outbreak. However organisers say the event is being held to raise awareness of the deadly disease, and they planned to raise £1,500 through discretionary donations for Doctors Without Borders, a charity working in west Africa. But Tom Dannatt, chief executive and founder of Street Child, a charity running an Ebola crisis appeal, told the Telegraph that anyone trying to make light of the crisis or a profit out of it is 'reprehensible.' Organisers at the Scotch said the name of the flyer is a play on words, and that the theme was not Ebola but 1970s Saturday Night Fever. A spokesman said: 'The organisers of the charity event aim to raise awareness as well as hard funds, in the region of £1500, that would go towards the fight against the spread of Ebola, and victims affected by the disease.' He said it was a 'great shame' the event was now being viewed negatively. He added: 'The voluntary donation has always been stated from the start, as the original intention of the event was always to raise money as much money as possible for a good cause.' A flyer advertising the Saturday Night Ebola Fever event due to take place at The Scotch of St James in Mayfair . It has been organised by Mom X Dad, a London-based production agency. A spokesman for Mom X Dad said they were now not sure if the event would go ahead because of the negative reaction to it. He said: 'We knew that during Halloween people spend a lot of money and we wanted to capitalise on that to give something back. A burial team in Liberia, dressed in protective gear, are burying a suspected victim of the Ebola outbreak . It has been confirmed the number of people infected with Ebola has now exceeded 10,000 across the world . Three people suspected of having contracted Ebola wait outside a hospital for treatment in Monrovia, Liberia . 'The theme was never Ebola. It was always Saturday Night Fever, Ebola is the cause we are fighting for.' He said they had never intended to 'make light' of the current crisis. The Scotch is a music venue for popular and emerging musicians and has seen Sir Paul McCartney and Jimi Hendrix perform there. The Ebola crisis has been referred to as 'the most severe acute health emergency in modern times' by the World Health Organisation. (WHO) The RFA Argus, equipped with hundreds of medics and sailors, is due to arrive in Sierra Leone to help deal with the Ebola crisis after it set sail from Falmouth in south England on October 17 with life saving equipment . More than 4,500 people have died from Ebola so far, most in west Africa. Almost 400 medics and marines left the UK on a 'floating hospital' earlier this month bound for Sierra Leone - one of the worst hit areas affected by the crisis. Prime Minister David Cameron has said more needs to be done to help victims of the crisis. Ebola spreads through close contact with a sufferer's bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat, vomit, faeces, urine, saliva or semen. The Ebola virus  infected more than 10,000 people . It can be incubated for 21 days and symptoms include a fever, flu-like body aches and abdominal pain, and then vomiting and diarrhoea. According to the WHO the number of confirmed, probable and suspected cases of the disease is now 10,141 with 4,922 fatalities. The number of suspected cases has increased by 200 over the past four days. There has been just one known British case. William Pooley, a nurse, was infected with the disease while treating patients in Sierra Leone. He was flown back to the UK by the RAF and treated in an isolation tent and eventually cured of the disease. He has now returned to the country to help more victims.","A 'sexy Ebola containment suit' for men and women is being sold online .

Team news . Southampton . Ronald Koeman has no fresh injury concerns as he prepares his side for the visit of Leicester on Saturday. Saints sit second in the Premier League table following a fine run of form, aided by the fact Koeman has been able to select from the majority of his squad for much of the season. Only James Ward-Prowse (foot) and long-term absentee Jay Rodriguez (knee) are missing with Sadio Mane pushing for a start having come off the bench late on in the win at Hull last weekend. Provisional squad: Forster, K Davis, Cropper, Clyne, Fonte, Gardos, Alderweireld, Bertrand, Targett, Schneiderlin, S Davis, Wanyama, Reed, Cork, Tadic, Yoshida, Mane, Long, Mayuka, Pelle, Gallagher. Ronald Koeman has no fresh injury concerns ahead of Southampton's game against Leicester . Leicester . Leonardo Ulloa is set to return for Leicester after being rested following a groin injury last week. The striker was on the bench for the 1-0 home defeat to West Brom but is primed to return at Southampton. Matt Upson (foot) is still out but Foxes boss Nigel Pearson is hopeful the defender, who is yet to play since joining in the summer, could return before Christmas. Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Smith, Morgan, Moore, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Drinkwater, Hammond, James, King, Cambiasso, Albrighton, Mahrez, Knockaert, Vardy, Ulloa, Nugent, Schlupp, Wood, Powell. Leicester forward Leonardo Ulloa is set to return to the starting line-up for the trip to St Mary's . Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Victor Wanyama has scored three goals in his last six Premier League appearances, having failed to net in his previous 26. The last eight league meetings between Leicester and Southampton have been in the Championship, with the teams drawing both matches the last time they were together in the top flight in 2003-04. Southampton have conceded just five league goals this season; fewer than any other team in England’s top four divisions. Leicester City have failed to score in four of their last five Premier League matches. Matt Mills (second right) scores Leicester's second goal in their 2-0 Championship win at Southampton in January 2012 - the last time the teams faced each other in all competitions . The Saints have won five and lost none of their last seven Premier League matches at St Mary’s. Southampton have conceded only three goals in their last nine on home soil and kept six clean sheets in that run. If Southampton win this game without conceding they will have the same W-D-L and goals conceded record as Wigan did after 11 games in 2005-06. The Latics eventually faded to finish 10th. The average finishing position for teams who have conceded five goals or fewer in their opening 10 games in the English top-flight is fourth. Southampton only conceded four goals in their opening 10 Premier League games last season; they conceded 19 in their next 10, only managing one clean sheet. Leicester have attempted just one direct-free kick shot this season, which was blocked. Only nine opposition players have been booked facing Leicester this season, fewer than any other club.","James Ward-Prowse and Jay Rodriguez still missing for Southampton .

"It's only three months since she welcomed first daughter Nelly with fiancé Greg Shepherd, but Billie Faiers has snapped back into her pre-pregnancy shape - and is definitely already thinking about baby number two. Speaking to MailOnline about getting back into shape after giving birth, the 24-year-old said: 'I still have some baby weight to lose but I'm very relaxed about it - I am wearing a lot of looser tops and then tight trousers so am dressing around it. Scroll down for video . Back in shape: Billie Faiers, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, gave birth in July but is already showcasing a toned physique and has hinted that she's thinking about baby number two . 'My priority is Nelly and I want to feel healthy not hungry so I'm not on any diet. The other day I ordered toast and macaroni cheese with bacon! 'I do find myself running around all the time and particularly with a young baby so I didn't feel too guilty.'

"Billionaire media mogul and founder of CNN Ted Turner is selling his private island off the coast of South Carolina for $23.7milllion - because his family does not use it enough. The 75-year-old entrepreneur and philanthropist, who is reportedly worth more than $2billion, bought the 4,680-acre St. Phillips Island in 1979, adding to his giant portfolio that has made him the largest landowner in the United States. The property, which is southeast of St. Helena Island near Port Royal Sound, is only reachable by boat, with a huge network of surrounding docks, while residents can only travel around in an SUV. The main house - set on a dirt road four miles from the island's dock - has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a large screened-in porch. The island is also self-sufficient, with its own water tower, solar panels and generator. Turner, who used to own the Atlanta Braves, told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday he was selling the island because it isn't used enough. Previously his family had enjoyed sailing, fishing and entertaining visitors there during vacations. On the property's listing, he wrote: 'My family and I have owned St Phillips Island along the South Carolina coast for many years now. While we have enjoyed the island and made so many memories there, we, unfortunately, are not able to visit as much as we would like. Therefore, we have chosen to sell the property in an attempt to pass on St. Phillips Island to another family who will enjoy this natural oasis as much as we did.'

Holiday home: He purchased the property, which is southeast of St. Helena Island near Port Royal Sound, in 1979 and ever since his family have enjoyed fishing, sailing and entertaining visitors there during vacations . Transport: It is only accessible by boat, but is surrounded by a large network of docking systems. Once on the island, visitors or residents generally use an SUV to get around, or can enjoy the scenery on foot . Vast: According to the Plantation Services, the estate agents based in Albany, Georgia who are selling the island, very few off the South Carolina and Georgia coast are totally private and have such a large amount of land . Landscape: Marsh and Creeks North End (pictured) offers stunning views of the Atlantic. Turner said one of the reasons he was selling the space is because his family could not visit it as much as they would like .

"A huge wasps nest measuring about 10 feet long has been found in a camper, in South Carolina. Robert McDougal of Hurry Up Towing in the sleepy town of Moncks Corner, had no idea there was a nest in the fold-down camper in his storage yard until he lifted it with a forklift. Incredibly he wasn't stung as he sat perfectly still for 20 minutes and waited for pest control to arrive. The nest is believed to have been one of the largest ever cleared in South Carolina. Scroll down for video . The buzz: A huge  nest about 10 feet long has found in a camper in South Carolina containing 350,000 bees . Pest control: Eric McCool of McCool Wildlife Services came in to tackle the nest and deal with the wasps . Eric McCool of McCool Wildlife Services estimated the nest be 10 feet long by 7 feet wide and 2 feet tall with an estimated 350,000 wasps. 'I was virtually inside the nest,' he said. 'It was very hot, stuffy. It was like crawling through a bunch of cushions, and you could feel them buzzing against the bee suit', he told the Post & Courier. The singing truth: Yellow Jackets or wasps are capable of stinging multiple times... and it hurts! McCool managed to keep his cool as he removed 37 queens, by hand. He refused to use pesticides despite the advice of a number of colleagues in the bee extraction business to simply burn the thing out. 'Bee vacuum and grabbing bags,' he said, literally tearing loose pieces of the comb and stuffing them into trash bags. 'Quite an adrenalin rush.' He was stung a half-dozen times, but in a two-decade career extracting hives and nests, he figures he's been stung more than 6,000 times. Yellow jacket nests are occasionally very large. Known as the 'lightweight' bee, they are casually brushed away by people who would be more circumspect around a honey bee, wasp or hornet however they do sting and are capable of multiple stings with their venom carrying quite the kick. A trash can-sized nest found in Charleston County in the 1990s was estimated to have 250,000 worker bees.

"Disgraced Luis Suarez received a hero’s welcome when he appeared on the balcony of his home after being kicked out of the World Cup. The shamed striker was sent back to Uruguay after being hit with a nine-game international ban and four-month suspension from all football for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini last Tuesday. But standing on the deck of his home in Lagomar, near Montevideo, the 27-year-old looked unperturbed by the ordeal. Some might say he even looked happy to be home, giving a thumbs-up to admirers who had gathered. Thumbs up: Luis Suarez gestures to fans from the balcony of his home, near Montevideo . Wearing a hooded grey top, smiling Suarez was accompanied by his children Benjamin and Delfina. His return came as his team-mates trained in Rio ahead of their clash with Colombia and news that Liverpool are set to sell him to Barcelona for £80million. Earlier in the day fans flocked to Carrasco International Airport to greet the arrival of the banned striker. Uruguayan President Jose Mujica was even there at one point but left when he heard Suarez’s flight from Brazil had been delayed. Because of the delay, the crowd of about 1,000 fans were moved from the airport terminal to an adjacent air force base to await his arrival. Angry: Uruguay national coach Oscar Tabarez claims the forward has been made a worldwide scapegoat by FIFA . The Uruguayan Football Association are preparing an appeal against the severity of the sentence, which also includes a £64,000 fine and national coach Oscar Tabarez claimed the forward had been made a worldwide scapegoat by FIFA. During an extraordinary press conference at the Maracana on Friday evening, Tabarez read a pre-prepared 13-minute statement to claim that pressure from the English media forced FIFA to ban him for four months. The Uruguay coach then immediately quit his position on FIFA’s technical committee and told Suarez that he has the full support of his country’s people. Rapturous reception: Luis Suarez was joined by his children as he greeted the army of fans who had gathered . Tabarez said: ‘Many times you forget the scapegoat is a person who has rights and that in this specific case, besides the mistakes and faults he has committed, he has made significant contributions on the pitch. It is the contribution made by great football players is essential. ‘As a coach and a professor, and as a former teacher, I am presented with the theory of the scapegoat. You know what I am talking about, of giving a punishment, to someone who commits a transgression, not a crime. ‘We know the protagonists and not only because of the profile he has because of the mistakes, but there is another side to him. That is a message: the severity was excessive. ‘Perhaps I do have the answers but like many people, those who not only have to make disciplinary decisions - who wins? Who loses? Who benefits? Who is harmed? Who got things their way? ‘To one of these questions, I will not give you a final answer, but I will try to find a response. On the basis of these exaggerated decisions, only with decisions of this nature I doubt it. After the Suarez and Chiellini episode we have seen other things measured with a different measure. ‘When that happens we have the omission because not all cases have to do with the transgression with indiscipline. Unavoidably this leads to exaggeration in terns if punishment. Acknowledging his fans: Luis cradled his daughter as he waved to fans from his balcony . ‘We should punish and sanction, but one must always give the opportunity to hear from the person.’ Tabarez was highly critical of the FIFA’s disciplinary panel after they failed to give Suarez the chance to speak for himself after the incident with Chiellini. FIFA’s strict regulations rule Luis from any involvement in football mean he cannot even watch Liverpool or Uruguay in action — he is banned from football stadiums and must train alone away from Liverpool’s Melwood training ground. Suarez can be sold during his spell in football exile — a strong possibility — but cannot personally join in negotiations. Barcelona have made it clear that Suarez’s ban does not impact on their intention to sign him and Liverpool have already started to get replacements. Liverpool are taking specialist legal advice, while the striker’s lawyer Alejandro Balbi was in Barcelona to discuss his client’s future . Adam Lallana will become a Liverpool player in the next 48 hours after Southampton relented and accepted a £25million offer for the England forward, four weeks after receiving the call from Anfield officials. Showing their support: Fans carrying banners waited outside Luis Suarez's home after he returned home from the World Cup . Backing their man: Luis Suarez has been hit with a nine-game international ban and four-month suspension . Liverpool have also launched a bid to sign Lazar Markovic from Benfica. Following this third, high-profile biting incident, it is no surprise that Suarez’s major sponsor Adidas are thinking of ditching him. He has already been punished for racially abusing Patrice Evra and biting Branislav Ivanovic. A statement said: ‘Adidas does not condone Luis Suarez’s recent behaviour and we will again be reminding him of the high standards we expect from our players. We have no plan to use Suarez for any additional marketing activities during the World Cup. We will discuss all aspects of our future partnership directly with Suarez and his team after the tournament.’ Another of Suarez’s backers, 888poker, are likely to drop him, with a spokesman saying: ‘888poker is seriously reviewing its relationship with the player as we will not tolerate unsporting behaviour.’ The independent FIFA disciplinary committee, chaired by Claudio Sulser of Switzerland, reached the decision to hand  Suarez a World Cup record ban after 10 hours of talks spread over Wednesday night and Thursday morning before it was announced at FIFA’s daily briefing at the Maracana. The player and the Uruguay FA had been informed minutes beforehand. The suspension starts with immediate effect. Causing England havoc: Suarez scored the winner in Uruguay's 2-1 win over Roy Hodgson's side . The committee took into account that it was not the first time Suarez had bitten an opponent. His first victim was PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal in 2010, for which he received a seven-match ban, and then Chelsea’s Ivanovic in 2013, which brought a 10-game ban. Sulser said: ‘Such behaviour cannot be tolerated and in particular not at a World Cup when the eyes of millions are on the stars on the field. The disciplinary committee took into account all the factors of the case and the degree of Mr Suarez’s guilt in accordance with the relevant provisions of the code.’ The Uruguayan media claimed that Sulser’s committee had come under pressure from South American football chiefs, including the English-hating Argentinian football president Julio Grondona, not to punish Suarez too severely. Will Suarez wear a Liverpool shirt again?: Despite the controversy Barcelona are still keen to sign the striker . But FIFA insisted that there was no interference at all in the process. The world body’s president Sepp Blatter had been in Manaus watching Switzerland beat Honduras and  flew back to Rio while the Suarez hearing was going on. Meanwhile, the Football Writers’ Association, who made Suarez their player of the year last season, decided not to strip the Liverpool star of his title. Uruguay face Colombia in the last 16 on Saturday Central defender Jose Maria Gimenez said the team were ‘more united than ever’, while the country’s sports minister Liliam Kechichian commented: ‘We are hurt by this excessive sanction. Now let’s see how we can help this human being and whether the group can show its class and its love for La Celeste.’","Uruguay striker shows no sign of strain as he waves at fans .

"The former German chancellor Helmut Kohl branded the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana 'idiotic', an explosive new book has claimed. The 84-year-old, who led Germany from 1982 to 1998, also added that had Diana become queen immediately, she 'would have done her bit in bed'. It has also emerged he described Prince Philip as a 'blockhead' and accused former prime minister Margaret Thatcher of falling asleep at meetings. Scroll down for video . Former German chancellor Helmut Kohl pictured at a book signing event in 2005. An explosive new book about him has been published by journalist Heribert Schwan . In the book, Mr Kohl says the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana was an 'absolutely idiotic' affair . The claims come in a controversial book by by journalist Heribert Schwan and is based on extensive interviews with the former chancellor. According to the book, Mr Kohl told Mr Schwan that while Prince Charles was 'entirely friendly', he was unimpressed with his marriage to Diana Spencer in 1981. He said: 'Her marriage was an absolutely idiotic affair. 'Had she become queen immediately she would have done her bit in bed, created three princes and her duty to the nation would have been fulfilled. But like this she had to travel around, talk to mayors and so on and then she withered away.' The royal family also comes in for more criticism with Prince Philip described as a 'blockhead'. The former chancellor also criticises the behaviour of Prince Philip, pictured with the Queen, describing him as a 'blockhead' The book also accuses Margaret Thatcher of falling asleep during meetings saying she would 'doze off during summits' Mr Kohl, who has retreated from public life in recent years, had instructed lawyers to halt the publication, of 'Legacy: the Kohl transcripts'. Mr Schwan had been asked to write the former chancellor's memoirs and had already conducted more than 600 hours of taped interviews between 2001 and 2002 when the pair fell out. Earlier this year, a court told the journalist he must return the tapes, but he was able to delay handing them over until he was able to make full transcripts of the conversations, and published the book without Mr Kohl's permission. Meanwhile the book also features Mr Kohl's views on other former world leaders, including Margaret Thatcher. In one interview he recalled how the former prime minister would 'doze off during summits and nearly fall of her chair, clutching her handbag.' He claimed that former US president Bill Clinton, pictured, could not focus his mind because he was too busy dealing with the Monica Lewinsky affair . He also spoke about former US president Bill Clinton, saying he could not focus his mind, because he was too busy dealing with the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Meanwhile he has also claimed that current German chancellor Angela Merkel could 'barely hold a knife and fork properly' while saying that at state dinners, 'she loitered around so much I had to repeatedly tell her to pull herself together.' But the co-author of the book has defended its publication saying it shows Mr Kohl is a man with a sense of humour. In recent years, Mr Kohl, who has retreated from public life since suffering a bad fall and lives with his 50-year-old wife.","Claims come in an explosive new book based on interviews with Mr Kohl .

"A wearable drone that is worn on the wrist has won a prestigious wearable contest run by chip giant Intel. Called Nixie, the drone folds up and attaches to a wrist strap, and is the world's first wearable drone. When the wearer wants it to start filming, they press a button and the drone unfolds and flies overhead, tracking their movements using motion sensors. Scroll down for video . The Nixie wearable drone was created by researchers at Stanford University and is a finalist in Intel's annual Make It Wearable competition. Nixie is a drone, worn on the wrist (concept illustrated) and expands at the touch of a button. The team has created a prototype version and recently received $50,000 (£30,700) in funding . Last week, Polaroid and HTC both released details about handheld devices set to rival GoPro. The former is planning to release the Polaroid Cube - a tiny action camera with a square design. And a teaser video and leaked images reveal that HTC is planning to release a similar device of its own, in the shape of a toy periscope. The Polaroid Cube will be available for £89 ($99.99) from 1 October. HTC's camera is due to launch next month. The drone then returns to the wearer's wrist, which could be controlled using a timer, or summoned using gestures. It was developed by Dr Christoph Kohstall, a physics researcher at Stanford University, with colleagues Jelena Jovanovic and Michael Niedermayr. Today, the drone won Intel's annual Make It Wearable competition. As a result, the team has been awarded $500,000  to help make it a reality. 'We are very happy, humbled and really honoured,' Jelena Jovanovic of Nixie told MailOnline. 'We have all the core functionality of the drone - we've solved all of the hardest challenges, we have stable wristbands that can unfold and are stable in flight, and navigation is solved. 'The next stage is that we have half a million dollars, and we want to make it real.' Jovanovic said the final product will be 'safe, beautiful and intuitive' 'Ww will target people who do adventure sports like rock climbers, we are offering a lot of value - and we think will be a bit more expensive that a GoPro. 'Ultimately we want to target the point and shoot camera market, and we want to be in than range. 'We hope we can revive the camera market.' In addition to the prize money, all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the Santa Clara-based tech giant. Dr Christoph Kohstall has also created an early prototype, which will be developed and is set to undergo further testing later this year. 'Nixie is a tiny wearable camera on a wrist band,' the firm said. 'The wrist straps unfold to create a quadcopter that flies, takes photos or video, then comes back to you. 'Nixie is in development. Stay tuned!' Second prize winner, Open Bionics was awarded $200,000, using low cost, high efficiency 3-D printing and scanning to bring customized products to amputees for less than $1,000. Third prize winner and recipient of $100,000, ProGlove is offering an enterprise invention that seeks to reduce physical work stress, improve ergonomics and reduce costly workplace mistakes . When the wearer wants it to start filming, they press a button and the drone unfolds (illustrated) and flies overhead, tracking their movements using motion sensors. The drone then returns to the wearer's wrist, which could be controlled using a timer, or summoned using gestures . The Nixie drone is a cross between a GoPro action camera (Hero4 pictured left) and a traditional quadcopter (stock image pictured right) Other finalists include the Vumbl sports and activity necklace, a wrist-worn air conditioning unit, and a production glove. Make It Wearable is a year-long contest, open to students over the age of 13, designers, engineers, and makers. CEO Brian Krzanich in January launched the 'Make it Wearable' contest to encourage entrepreneurs and hobbyists to use Intel's chips to develop new kinds of wearable technology. The prize money is meant to help the winners bring their prototype to market. 'This was an experiment to see what we could do in this space and see what kind of creativity we could spawn,' Krzanich said at an award event on Monday. 'The real value in this was the diversity of the teams and ideas.' Finalists included a pad that lets premature babies in incubators feel the heartbeat of their mothers, and a necklace that uses patterns of pulses felt on the chest to give cyclists turn-by-turn directions so they don't need to look at their smartphones. Stanford University and physics researcher Dr Christoph Kohstall has also created an early prototype, (pictured) which will be developed and is set to undergo further testing later this year. It is unknown when the Nixie will go on sale, and how much it will retail for, but MailOnline has contacted the firm for more information . Samsung Electronics, Motorola and other technology companies are rolling out growing numbers of smart watches and fitness bands, but the wearable category has yet to gain major traction with consumers. Apple plans to roll out a smartwatch in 2015. Intel, whose chips are ubiquitous in personal computers and servers, this year bought health tracker startup Basis. It also has teamed up on other wrist-worn gadgets with Fossil and Opening Ceremony. Krzanich, a weekend tinkerer who restored a 1974 Land Cruiser in his free time, is betting that other hobbyists have as much chance as major technology companies of dreaming up compelling wearable computing gadgets. In addition to the prize money, all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the Santa Clara-based tech giant. The winner of Intel's competition will be announced on 3 November. This illustration reveals where the camera on the Nixie drone is positioned . To that end, Intel launched Edison, a tiny computer packaged in an SD-card form factor aimed at making it easy for clothing and gadget makers to integrate the platform into wearable products. Earlier this year, Helio Aerospace Industries unveiled the first 'pet' drone that automatically follows its owner - and could change the way sports are filmed. It is not wearable, like Nixie, but the Airdog drone can be fitted with a GoPro camera to capture high definition footage of extreme sports, tracking everything from skateboarders to BMX riders. AirDog tracks and follow users and their trajectory, and has a flight time of up to 15 minutes. It can also reach speeds of 40mph (64km/h). To use AirDog, a programmable remote is strapped to the wrist or helmet, and it is likely to retail for $995 (£612).","The Nixie wearable drone was created by researchers at Stanford University .

"Phil Neville’s Manchester United future should be resolved this week after he arrived back into the country from the World Cup in Brazil. Neville, who served as first-team coach at Old Trafford under David Moyes last season, has finished his punditry duties with the BBC and flew back into London on Monday afternoon. He will now return to Manchester and it is understood that he will have discussions in the coming days with senior officials at the AON Training Complex at Carrington to clarify whether there will be a role for him at Old Trafford under new manager Louis van Gaal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Man City fan mock Phil Neville on a train . Something to smile about? Neville is back in Manchester from BBC co-commentary duties in Brazil . His future remains clouded in mystery but it would seem unlikely that he will maintain such a senior position at the club next season. A United insider was last week keen to stress that the ‘Class of 92’ are ‘part of the fabric of the football club’ and but Neville is still to be informed what role, if any at all, that the club can find for him following the exit of Moyes. Neville may exit as the club look to make a break with the dismal campaign endured by Moyes, with Van Gaal having already brought in Marcel Bout as his assistant coach, although it could yet be that United find a reduced role for the former England international in the academy. Nicky Butt, meanwhile, will remain with the club, as Sportsmail first revealed last week. End of an era: Neville was part of the unsuccessful team which led United under Moyes last season . One of the graduates of the Class of 1992, Butt is contracted with the club and works alongside Warren Joyce with the under-21 team and manages the under-19 side in the UEFA Youth League. It is believed that he is set to continue in that position next season. Sportsmail understands that Butt has made no indication to the club that he would be unwilling to continue in his role with a highly-placed source saying: ‘The Class of 92 are very important to Manchester United. ‘Nicky is a member of staff at the club, he has a position here and he is working with Warren Joyce, who will remain at the club.’ Butt was promoted to the first-team fold following the sacking of David Moyes in April as he assisted close friend Ryan Giggs after the Welshman assumed managerial responsibilities at Old Trafford. Once Van Gaal was handed the job, there were suspicions that the Dutchman may look to weed out the influence of the Class of ‘92 to make way for his own backroom staff but with Giggs on board as assistant, the new manager has indicated his desire to maintain a link with United’s heritage. Class of 92: Neville remained on the coaching staff with other famous faces including Scholes and Butt . Have a word: Neville offers some guidance to Giggs, who took charge of United after Moyes was axed .","Phil Neville has returned to England for talks with Manchester United.
Neville was first-team coach under David Moyes last season.

"Mario Balotelli has made it clear he wants to join Arsenal. The striker is furious he has been blamed for Italy getting knocked out of the World Cup. He was always set to leave AC Milan this summer but he is now convinced, not least because he feels he is a target for ‘ultras’ racists and despite problems he encountered in the Premier League while at Manchester City, he recognises that England is more cosmopolitan – especially London. VIDEO Scroll down for Mario Balotelli: I don't want to be the World Cup star . On the move? Mario Balotelli wants to join Arsenal after a disappointing World Cup with Italy . Home: Balotelli is back in Italy after a disastrous World Cup in Brazil with his national team . Balotelli wants to force a deal through with Arsenal next week because he is worried the Gunners have other striker targets in mind, such as Real Madrid’s Alvaro Morata. Southampton, who sold 18-year-old Luke Shaw to Manchester United for £27million plus add-ons, could snap up 16-year-old left back protegee Oscar Borg from West Ham. Borg is yet to sign as a scholar for the Hammers but would cost the Saints around £220,000 under academy compensation rules. Real Madrid have pulled out of the race – first revealed in the Football Grapevine – to outbid Barcelona for Luis Suarez. Instead, Real are poised to sign Colombian Radamel Falcao – who has missed the Word Cup through injury – from Monaco in a £60million deal. That could see Madrid drive down Suarez’s fee significantly. Moving on? Luis Suarez (left) and Radamel Falcao (right) could join Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively . Uruguayan Edinson Cavani, currently of Paris St Germain, will come back on the radar of Manchester United if Wayne Rooney does not agree to how Louis van Gaal wants to utilise him. It is understood Van Gaal is set to play hard-ball with Rooney as a statement of intent of who is charge at Old Trafford. Fernando Torres wants to stay at Chelsea and Frank Lampard may even offer to play for the club rather than go ‘on loan’ to QPR ahead of playing for New York City in the MSL. Tottenham believe they will sign Swansea left-back Ben Davies when the transfer window opens on July 1. In the market: Tottenham want to sign Swansea's Ben Davies (right) iSay . This week there is really only one thing to say. Despite some terrific games, goals and excitement, professional football no longer feels Jogo Bonito – the beautiful game. Allegations of FIFA corruption, bungs for betting syndicates and a player assaulting a fellow professional for no reason. There is an old newspaper saying: Dog bites man, no story. Man bites dog, big story. But, far from losing his livelihood or even liberty, Suarez arrived back in Uruguay following his ban after an unprovoked assault on Italian Giorgio Cheillini hailed as a national hero. Banned: Luis Suarez was handed a four-month suspension for biting Giorgio Chiellini . Indeed, he can look forward to a pay rise if a move to Barcelona goes through. Sometimes justice and morality around modern football seems to be upside-down. After all his grandmother has been quoted as saying the FIFA ban was ‘barbaric’ and he has been treated like a, er, ‘dog’ as if HE has been the victim of rough, rough justice. Talk about barking. Libero . Roy Hodgson clings onto Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, but how can they possibly be the future? Both of them have been great players. And top blokes, too. But the fact is that, either as a partnership or in their own right, for all their caps they have not influenced their country as they have done their respective clubs. Yet, misguidedly, Hodgson thinks Gerrard and Lampard can help bring the Young Lions on. Time to move on: Frank Lampard (left) and Steven Gerrard have yet to decide on their England futures . Yes, having some experience in the middle of the park would help Ross Barkley, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and, possibly, Ravel Morrison. So why not look to West Ham’s Mark Noble and Hull’s Tom Huddlestone? They are both 27 and were both magnificent midfield leaders for their clubs last season. Back Heel . Luis Suarez has moved into No 1 position for the most outrageous incident on the pitch at a World Cup. And the previous worst? Well, not his ‘Hand of God’ incident at the last finals, nor Diego Maradona’s in 1986, and not even the Antonio Rattin turn out in 1966. The spat between Dutchman Frank Rijkaard and German Rudi Voller at the 1990 finals was vile. BTW . In a week when football has been in moral maze – some might argue malaise – let’s not forget the positive power of the game.

For more information, go to www.mofarahfoundation.org.uk . Stop Press . A Dutch aerospace engineering company, Ruimtevaartbedrijf SXC, have said that if Holland win the whole thing, they will fly the squad and manager Van Gaal into space. It brings a new dimension to the old cliche about being ‘Over The Moon.’ FOTB . It’s understandable why Liverpool have kept their foot on the ball and not responded to the Suarez situation until they have seen the fine print. Last time around, the club’s knee-jerk reaction backfired. What next? Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool must decide what to do about Suarez . VIDEO Suarez family say he should leave Liverpool . But it’s not as if Liverpool are close to taking a moral stance. They want to maximise a commercial asset. Condemning Suarez would only result in his transfer fee plummeting even more. Liverpool wanted £100million but now think they can still get £80m despite all the baggage. That’s how the business of football has become – even for a club with such strong views on morals. Y-Factor . Why does the FA think a proper post-mortem into the debacle in Brazil is not required? Why is Hodgson, who has presided over dire showings at two tournaments, seemingly fire proof? The answer is, for all the so called modernisation at the FA, the ‘blazers’ in charge want a yes man who ticks the boxes rather than a man who would tear up some trees. I-bet .

"West Ham will have the word ‘London’ inserted on their new club crest when they move into the Olympic Stadium in 2016, if fans approve. As the Hammers enter their penultimate season at Upton Park, the Barclays Premier League club have proposed plans to evolve their emblem with supporters invited to cast a deciding vote on the design. Sportsmail understands the inclusion of ‘London’ in the sleek design is a nod to West Ham’s historic standing in the capital, while helping the ambitious Hammers make strides in a competitive global football market when they move into their new Stratford home in less than two years. VIDEO Scroll down to watch West Ham unveil their new kit for the 2014/15 season . Proposal: The new badge, with the word London prominent on it, has been put to fans for approval . The Boleyn Castle, a symbolic feature on the badge for many years, has been replaced as part of a ‘bolder, cleaner and more vibrant crest’ following a detailed supporter consultation from thousands of fans which concluded last week. Two gold Hammers will remain through the centre, maintaining a link to the club’s Thames Ironworks inception back in 1895. The design has received a mixed reaction from some supporters on social media, however. Twitter user @westhamtransfer wrote: ‘Why do we need ‘London’ on our badge? If you want to know where West Ham is then use Google’. Another fan, @LDHarv, said: ‘The new badge has the right idea but the font used is rubbish.’ Legends: The likes of Moore (above) and Brooking (below) have worn the famous crossed hammers . But @TezzyWilsonWHU gave his backing to the new design, saying: ‘The badge is nice. All they have done is remove the castle and added the word London’. And @JC_Kemp added: ‘Talks about the updated West Ham badge sound positive. Finally some proper design thought being applied.’ West Ham fans, who have a history of buying tickets with the club, have until this Friday to submit their vote on what will be the 16th evolution of the badge that has been worn proudly over the years by greats such as Bobby Moore, Sir Geoff Hurst and Sir Trevor Brooking. An statement on the club’s official website read: ‘The board understand that the success of the club’s move depends on its acceptance among supporters as the home of West Ham United. ‘The club is therefore on the cusp of a multi-million pound investment at the stadium and so it is imperative to ensure that, together, we get it right from the outset. New home: The change of badge will coincide with West Ham's 2016 move to the Olympic Stadium . Evolution: The current badge, as seen on new signing Diego Poyet, is the 15th version of the crest . ‘The crest’s evolution is the handiwork of world-class designers, who, crucially, are lifelong supporters of the club too. 'Its final design is the product of careful deliberation following supporter consultation and the comprehensive feedback received, as well as a reflection of feeling among the club’s stakeholders.’ West Ham are not the only Premier League club to propose plans to modernise their crest. Everton have also set up a voting process for fans to pick their new badge. Sportsmail has obtained further images of how the flat design would look, with the 3D version only being used for digital purposes. A . club source said: 'The two shades of claret are a graphical . representation of the HMS Warrior's bow, the inspiration behind the new . crest shape. 'However, . they will only ever be visible in a 3D form and this is not how the . crest will appear in the majority of its applications. The 3D . presentation of the crest will primarily be used across digital . platforms. New look: The two shades of claret are a graphical representation of the HMS Warrior's bow, the inspiration behind the new crest shape .

"A woman who was too overweight to wear a car seatbelt lost  20st through dieting and exercise after refusing to burden the taxpayer with NHS weight loss surgery. Emma Sealey, 35, from Redditch, believed she would die before she reached her 40th birthday unless she slimmed down her 28st 8lbs frame. Despite family members urging her to petition her GP to have an NHS gastric band fitted, she decided to lose the weight naturally and lost an incredible 19st 9lb. She dropped from a size 32 to a size eight, slimming down to 8st 13lb in just two years. Scroll down for video . Left: Emma Sealey pictured at her heaviest weight of 20 stone; Right: Emma at her current weight of 8 stone 13lbs . She said: 'I could barely walk from my house to my fiancé's car, let alone walk around the block, and when I got there I couldn't even fit the seatbelt over me.' 'I hadn't stepped on scales for years but when I found out how much I weighed I was disgusted with myself,' she added. 'I needed to do something about it, but I knew it was my problem and I had to get myself out of it. I didn't want surgery on the NHS - I want the NHS to concentrate on spending money on people who actually need it.' Emma Sealey, 35, of Redditch (pictured left at her heaviest), was too overweight to wear a car seatbelt and lost a stunning 20st through dieting (pictured right recently) Emma exercising part way through her weight loss journey, which saw her drop 20 stone . Emma started gaining weight in childhood after a close friend died. She said: 'I was devastated, and I expect it was one of the triggers for my comfort eating. I had a fairly tumultuous childhood. At one point I was sent to boarding school, and didn't want to go home at the weekends because I was so unhappy there. 'I found it easy to turn to food to cheer me up - things like chocolate and crisps. But the lift was always temporary. Before long I was overweight and I was suffering inside, feeling ashamed of myself.' Emma after her weight loss with her fiancé Brian (left) and ready for a night out (right). Her weight started to fall away at a rate of a stone a month after she adopted a healthy eating plan . By September 2010 Emma weighed nearly 29st and her health was starting to deteriorate. She said: 'Looking back, I was lucky I wasn't in a wheelchair. I couldn't walk up stairs without becoming out of breath and putting the seat belt on in Brian's car around me left me hugely uncomfortable. 'My mother told me to apply for a gastric band on the NHS. I refused. 'I don't agree with weight loss surgery on the NHS in general. It should be given only to those who can't exercise. If your legs work, and there's nothing critically wrong with your body, you can find a way out of it.' She visited her local GP in the hope of getting a referral for weight-loss classes. Emma before she lost weight. Emma lost a stunning 20 stone after refusing to burden the taxpayer with NHS weightloss surgery . She said: 'I hadn't stepped on a weighing scale for years and I was terrified about what it was going to tell me. When I realised I was 28st 8lbs I was absolutely disgusted with myself. 'It was the first time I'd been weighed in years. I didn't need the doctor to say anything. I knew I had to do something - in my heart I knew that if I didn't do something, I wouldn't live to see my 40th birthday. My BMI was 73.2.' Considering the ideal BMI is 18.5-24.9 and over 40 is considered obese, Emma knew she had to take action. 'It was nothing to be proud of. It was the wake-up call I needed.' With the help of a local Cambridge Weight Plan consultant, Emma started to wean herself off fattening convenience foods. Before beginning her weight loss regime, Emma typically ate nothing for breakfast, followed by sausage rolls and a large bag of cheese and onion crisps for lunch, with a chicken curry with rice and naan bread for her evening meal. Emma part of the way through her weight loss  (left) and exercising on her cross trainer at home (right) when nearing her goal weight . She would also snack on chocolate, particularly Kit Kats during the day. To lose weight, she switched to Bran Flakes with skimmed milk for breakfast, with a tuna sandwich on brown bread for lunch, with steamed white fish with fresh vegetables for her evening meals. When she snacks, she tucks into apples, oranges, strawberries and pears. As her weight started to fall away at a rate of a stone a month, she also began regular exercise. She said: 'I go on a cross-trainer I have at home and I love jogging and cycling when the weather is good enough.' Emma now weighs 8st 13lbs and can wear a size eight dress, having dropped 12 dress sizes - an incredible total weight loss of 19st 9lbs. She said: 'I'm a lot more confident now - I love walking past the shop window and looking at my reflection. 'Being with Brian is more fun than ever, and he loves my new figure. It's so nice to be able to take trips in the car with him and not have to worry about fitting into the seatbelt.'","Emma Sealey, 35, from Redditch, dropped from 28st 8lbs to 8st 13lbs .

"Dozens of people are being infected with the deadly Ebola virus each day in Sierra Leone, as the terrifying disease tears through the country's capital city, Freetown. Yesterday, forty-nine new cases were confirmed in just 24 hours, the National Ebola Response Center (NERC) reported. So many people are succumbing to the deadly virus that removing the dead bodies is becoming a serious problem. Lawmaker Claude Kamanda who represents a western area of the country said that more than 20 deaths are being reported each day. Scroll down for videos . Sierra Leone health workers working with the bodies of Ebola victims at Kenema Hospital in the east . He told the local Politico newspaper that authorities are experiencing challenges collecting corpses from both quarantined and non-quarantined homes. Sierra Leone is one of three West African nations at the epicenter of the worst outbreak of the disease on record. According he latest statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has killed more than 4,500 people since first appearing deep in the Guinean forest last December. Authorities say the uncontrolled movement of people from the interior to Waterloo - which is the gateway to Freetown - has fueled the increase of Ebola cases in the west.

There are 851 total confirmed Ebola cases in the  Western Area Urban and Western Area Rural zones, NERC reported. In terms of numbers of cases, the two western zones may soon surpass a former epicenter of the outbreak in Sierra Leone - the eastern districts of Kenema and Kailahun where there have been a total of 1,012 confirmed cases. No new cases were reported yesterday in Kenema and Kailahun but a WHO spokeswoman said it is too early to declare that the epidemic has burned itself out in the east. Orphans from Sierra Leone whose parents have died of Ebola sharing a meal in the eastern district of Kenema . 'There was a drop in new cases in Kenema and Kailahun and fingers were crossed but there has been a bit of a flare up thanks to a couple of unsafe burials,' said Margaret Harris, WHO's spokeswoman in Sierra Leone. 'So it's too early to say we have a real decline ... definitely too early to say it's been beaten there.' The World Food Program delivered emergency food rations to people in Waterloo over the weekend, as local media reports suggest the western city may also have to be quarantined. 'The growing fear has left the public with no choice but to call on the Government for Waterloo to be quarantined as was done to other places including Kailahun, Kenema, Bombali, Port Loko and Moyamba Districts,' the Exclusive newspaper said. Most of the Ebola cases are still found in the eastern districts of Kenema and Kailahun but the disease seems to be taking a hold in the western areas of the country and spreading through the capital city, Freetown . A Red Cross burial team at Jobo Farm in Waterloo disinfects after recovering the bodies of an 80 year old grandmother and her granddaughter believed to have died of Ebola and abandoned for four days . Many residents of the capital note that Ebola has followed the same route across the country as rebels who in 1991 started a savage war in Kailahun district. The war ended in Freetown a decade later where the final battle was fought. Now the enemy is a disease, and the president is putting in place a  military-style response. President Ernest Bai Koroma last week appointed Defense Minister Alfred Palo Conteh as CEO of NERC.

The U.S. Embassy in Rwanda has urged Americans who may have a fever or who have traveled to Ebola countries 'to weigh carefully whether travel to Rwanda at this time is prudent'. 'Please note neither the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs nor the U.S. Embassy have authority over quarantine issues and cannot prevent a U.S. citizen from being quarantined should local health authorities require it,' the embassy said.","So many  are dying from Ebola that removing bodies is becoming a problem .

"House prices are set to fall next year as Britain’s housing market hits a ‘turning point’, according to a leading economic research group. The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) today says 2014 has seen the largest rise in home values since the financial crisis hit in 2007. Prices this year are expected to rise by 7.8 per cent – more than double the 3.5 per cent national average increase last year. Scroll down for video . Prices this year are expected to rise by 7.8 per cent – more than double the 3.5 per cent national average increase last year (File photo) But after three years of soaring prices the market is about to reach a ‘turning point’, it warns. Prices will slip by 0.8 per cent during 2015 after the market ‘got ahead of itself’ in the early months of this year, the group predicts. All of the figures are national averages, and do not reflect the wide disparity in house price movements between London and the South East and the rest of the country. Young buyers risk being priced out of the rising market, while an expected rise in interest rates will ‘startle’ prospective home owners, it says. Scott Corfe, a director at the CEBR, said: ‘Leading indicators already point to price declines in some parts of the UK, alongside falling new buyer enquiries and properties staying on the market for longer before they sell. ‘Affordability has become such an issue in the more expensive regions of the UK that buyers are starting to baulk at high prices.’ All of the figures are national averages, and do not reflect the wide disparity in house price movements between London and the South East and the rest of the country (File photo) New mortgage rules, introduced in April, have also led to a slowdown in lending that will ‘curb demand for property in the short term’, he said. A rise in interest rates from the Bank of England next year is also expected to cool house price growth in the short term, he said. He added: ‘Although rises are expected to be very gradual, with rates remaining much lower than before the financial crisis, prospective buyers are likely to be startled by the first such increase – leading many to hold off from making purchases. ‘This too will lead to lower prices.’ But he stressed: ‘We are not anticipating a crash. The market is adjusting after getting ahead of itself at the start of 2014.’ The last time house prices grew by a double digit amount was in 2007 when they climbed by 10.9per cent, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. The CEBR predicts that, after slipping in 2015, prices will start to rise again, growing by 2.6 per cent during 2016, 3 per cent in 2017 and another 2.7 per cent in 2018. House prices fell in September for the first time in 17 months, Nationwide said last week. The 0.2 per cent dip knocked more than £1,000 off the value of a typical British home. Last week the Bank of England said it would not interfere with the Government’s Help to Buy scheme, which critics had accused of inflating house prices. Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, previously said he expects house prices ‘to rise at a more retrained restrained rate over the coming months’. In June, the Bank of England curbed mortgage lending by saying that no more than 15 per cent of a lenders’ new mortgages could be worth more than 4.5 times the income of the borrowers. Tougher industry-wide rules also came into force during April, where lenders are forced to ask more details about the lifestyles and spending habits of prospective borrowers. But the new rules have been criticised after the Mail revealed that mortgage applicants were being whether they play golf or eat steak, and asked how much they pay for a haircut. The line of questioning also saw mothers asked how many more children they were planning to have, and whether they wanted to return to work. Supporters of the new scheme say the ‘stress tests’ are designed to prevent a return to the reckless lending behind the financial meltdown of 2008.

"While it may seem like everyone's on Tinder these days, if you're a mass murdering Nazi - who has been dead fifty years - then you might have thought your chances of securing a date are rather slim. But it seems not. One old romantic has signed up to the dating app as a 22-year-old Adolf Hitler - and a surprising amount of women are swiping right. Returning from beyond the grave and into the world of internet dating, Hitler describes himself as 'selfish, impatient and a little insecure about having only one testicle'. Hitler appears to be looking for love on Tinder - nearly 50 years after he died in a bunker in Berlin . 'I make mistakes,' he adds. 'But if you can't handle me at my worst you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.' He also - with questionable taste - promises to be 'the Final Solution to your loneliness'. Tinder is a popular dating app where strangers who are in close proximity can 'like' a profile by swiping right. If the person in the profile swipes right too then the couple are able to chat via the app. Despite his less-than-flawless credentials, the German dictator appears to be enjoying more than his fair share of success on the dating app. One woman messages him saying: I knew it would be a good idea to swipe you right.' To which he replies: 'Lol I shouldn't have swiped across Europe. Those damn Russians.' Despite his less-than flawless credentials, the German dictator appears to be enjoying more than his fair share of success on the dating app with a number of women engaging in conversations with him . A surprising number of women swiped right for the dictator - who is best known for murdering 6 million Jews . Hitler promises to be the 'Final Solution' to loneliness - but warns he is 'selfish, impatient and a little insecure' Little is known about the person who took it upon himself to pose as the man responsible for the extermination of six million Jews, but it is thought that he has been on the app as Hitler for about one month. But, as for the real Hitler, he had a surprising amount of success with the opposite sex. He was believed to have had a number of girlfriends, including two fiancées, and was married to Eva Braun, albeit rather briefly. But as The Daily Dot points out, it's probably worth noting two of his former lovers committed suicide and two others made attempts - so whether it's 1945 or 2014, dating the dictator might not be such a good idea after all.

"A  committee of MPs has called on the Government to do more to stop citizens being duped by the 'copycat' sites which are charging for services (file picture) Motorists have been warned to be wary of copycat government websites which are charging users for services that are normally free. Unofficial websites which have been described as 'impersonators' have led to drivers paying extra for services such as applying for a driving test or driving licences or paying the congestion charge. A cross-party committee of MPs has now called on the Government to do more to stop citizens being duped by the 'copycat' sites. The Transport Select Committee said efforts were needed across Whitehall to tackle the problem, with search engines such as Google being alerted to problem websites. The committee's Labour chairwoman Louise Ellman said the Government 'must do more to warn motorists' about the misleading sites. The report looked into the work of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) and the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA). The AA told the committee it had seen an increase in complaints about 'impersonator websites' charging for services such as applying for a driving test or driving licences. The committee's report said that in written evidence to the committee, the motoring organisation recognised there was a case for services that added value such as 'checking services' or 'fast track services'. But it said the Government agencies appeared to co-exist with alternative, unofficial 'service providers'. The AA thought it 'almost immoral that (such sites) can ply a trade that basically tricks people'.' In the capital, Transport for London (TfL) had asked the DVLA to send letters to drivers who had used an unofficial website to pay the congestion charge. TfL is also consulting on a proposal that it should refuse to accept payments from copycat websites or other unauthorised third-parties, the report said. The committee noted that the problem goes beyond the Department for Transport, with the Government Digital Service (GDS) leading efforts to address the issue. The MPs heard that GDS tracks the activity of such sites and shares this information with Google, and other search engines, so they can identify and take action against 'websites that add little or no value to existing online Government services'. The National Trading Standards Board has also received an additional £120,000 in funding to 'clamp down on misleading websites'. The committee said the problems on the first day of the paperless car tax system, which descended into chaos with the DVLA website struggling with the demand, were an indication of the challenges facing the Government in moving services online. Unofficial websites have led to drivers paying extra for services such as applying for a driving test  (file picture) Ms Ellman said: 'DVLA and DVSA are important for delivering essential services related to tax, licensing, testing, and vehicle safety. 'The Department for Transport must ensure that its current re-organisation programme for these agencies delivers high quality services that benefit everyone. 'The recent problems experienced by motorists when road tax renewal went online demonstrates the importance of responding to change, having clear communication with the public and an effective contingency plan to maintain confidence . 'We welcome greater information sharing across the motoring agencies and the expansion of online services that we found were well-liked by many customers. 'However, the motoring agencies must continue to meet the needs of those customers who can't access or use digital services. 'Linked to this the Government must do more to warn motorists about misleading 'copycat' websites that charge for services provided for free by motoring agencies. 'We also call on DVLA to do more to explain the legal basis for the sharing of personal data with organisations engaged in parking enforcement and the steps it takes to deal with private parking companies caught misusing personal data supplied by the motoring agencies.' Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: 'David Cameron's incompetent Government has presided over digital tax disc chaos, delays to driving tests and rip-off copycat websites. 'Drivers deserve better, and this report is clear that ministers need to stamp out copycat websites and ensure motoring agencies have the tools they need to keep rogues off our roads.'","'Impersonator' websites charging motorists for services that are usually free .

"The pillar of rock known as ‘God’s Finger’ points to the sky above Brazil’s training base in the hills above Rio de Janeiro as if demanding a moment of respectful silence. Drumroll. Luiz Felipe Scolari will now attempt the same trick — holding together a nation using only the power of football — without the aid of a safety net. The knock-out stage adds even more drama to the World Cup. Scolari’s players completed the final session before leaving their stylish mountain retreat with a flourish of the crispest penalty kicks, to the delight of fans who must have been concerned by the awful display of finishing from open play which had gone before. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Marcelo set up Thiago Silva with cheeky backheel in training . Top boss: Scolari has transformed Brazil but Chile pose the toughest test he has faced so far . Pressure? What pressure? Scolari laughed off journalists' questions on Friday ahead of the game . Brazil have a fine tradition in penalty shoot-outs and they boast a formidable record against opponents Chile, unbeaten in 12 games since 2000. Yet doubt is rife ahead of the last-16 tie. ‘Our numbers are good against Chile, very good, but I’ve seen all their group games and this is one of the best Chile teams for a long time,’ said Gilberto Silva, the former Arsenal midfielder, who won the World Cup with Brazil in 2002. Gilberto’s caution reflects not only his playing style but also the public mood. It is positive and supportive — protests are not aimed at the team but at FIFA and the authorities who sank millions into football in a country devoid of many basic social facilities. Scolari’s squad left Teresopolis in a cavalcade of emergency service vehicles, including two fire engines with lights flashing in the twilight, and townsfolk lined the streets to wave them off. Arriving in Belo Horizonte, mothers held up children to the team bus windows and stars such as Thiago Silva responded with a smile of appreciation. And still there is an undercurrent of mild dread about what might happen if it goes wrong, as it did 64 years ago, when Brazil lost the final to Uruguay in the Maracana. Prodigy: Scolari has been getting the best out of Neymar and will be hoping he can fire Brazil to the title . Tough: But Alexis Sanchez and co will provide a big test as they come up against the host nation . ‘We want to avoid the ghost of 1950,’ said Gilberto. ‘I grew up  listening to those stories.’ Scolari didn’t help when he said he would rather have avoided Chile. Chile, slick and clinical, have  accounted for Spain and Brazil’s centre forward Fred found himself fielding questions this week about his team’s height advantage. Aerial bombardment is not normally the Brazilian way. Fred nodded politely and said: ‘The high ball could be a good option for us. They’re not tall, but they use their bodies a lot and have good pace.’ There are times Brazil demands a certain type of football. This is not one of them. This time it is not about step-overs and ball-juggling in the airport with Denilson and Ronaldo. This is about winning. Scolari is trusted to deliver. Despite his Chelsea flop, Big Phil gets along with the World Cup. He made the last four with Portugal and won it with Brazil — taking control in the midst of a stumbling qualifying campaign and injecting a sense of destiny. Friends: Thiago Silva was very big on his praise for the Brazil boss ahead of their last 16 tie . Tactician: Scolari runs his players through what he wants from them as Brazil train ahead of the Chile clash . ‘We had to build slowly,’ said Gilberto. ‘Not many believed we would win it. The first game against Turkey was very hard but we won and grew in confidence. ‘When we reached the next stage and won our first game, we knew we could go all the way. When we reached the final, we saw it in each other’s eyes. Ronaldo wanted to end the frustration from ’98, but every player was important.’ Parallels are being drawn here. Paulinho is expected to be replaced by Fernandinho today just as, 12 years ago, Scolari adjusted his midfield by dropping Middlesbrough’s Juninho after four games and bringing in Kleberson for the final three. ‘As a manager, he does not lose control of what he wants,’ said  Gilberto. ‘This is what makes him special to his players. He puts everyone in the right mind.’ Ringing the changes: Paulinho is expected to be replaced by Fernandinho after his goal against Cameroon . Danger man: Chile will challenge themselves to make it difficult for the seemingly unstoppage Brazil striker . When Scolari returned in November 2012, the brief was clear. Win the World Cup and cleanse the horrors of the Maracanazo. He started by losing 2-1 to England at Wembley in February 2013. There was room for improvement. England, since then, have not beaten a team which qualified for this tournament. Brazil, in contrast, have won 17 of the last 19 games, winning the Confederations Cup on the way. Perhaps more crucially, Scolari devised a platform for Neymar to perform freely. ‘He is the main player, a special guy,’ said Gilberto. ‘It is also important other players start to believe. I would like to see Oscar score more goals and Fred.’ There were encouraging signs in the win against Cameroon but from here there is no margin for error for Big Phil and his high-wire act. Nation expects: Neymar is the hero of millions as Brazil seek to win the World Cup on home soil .

"Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar? Brazil fans have brought posters of the Rolling Stones front-man dressed in a Colombia shirt to try and ensure they don't lose like Jagger. Mick Jagger has developed a reputation for his woeful predictions as every team he has backed so far has crashed out of the World Cup. And superstitious Brazilians have sought to harness his power of incorrect prediction by depicting him supporting their quarter-final opponents. Mockers: Brazil fans with a cardboard cut-out of Mick Jagger wearing a Colombia shirt and supporting them . Support: Jagger has built a reputation across the last two tournaments for supporting losing teams . New talisman: One fan holds up a picture of Jagger's head on Colombian star James Rodriguez's body . Jagger's reputation has developed over the past four years, but has been particularly noticeable this World CUp. At a concert in Rome last month he predicted to 70,000 fans that four-time World Cup champion Italy would pull off a clutch victory over Uruguay to advance to the knockout phase. The Italians lost 1-0 and headed home after the Group Stage. At a show in Lisbon in May, the singer predicted that Portugal, led by Cristiano Ronaldo, would win it all at the month-long tournament in Brazil. Portugal also went home before the knock-out stages. Earlier in the World Cup, Jagger suffered some good-hearted ridicule after taking to Twitter on June 19 to urge on his native England in a game, also with Uruguay. ""Let's go England! This is the one to win!!,"" he wrote. England lost. While Brazilians may laugh at Jagger, they love his music. The Stones' 2006 concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro drew an estimated 1 million people, a lot more than the 20,000 or so that have been packing the beach to watch World Cup games on a giant screen.

Brazil love: Jagger is known to be a fan of Brazillians having fathered a child with Luciana Gimenez (left) The number of football fans that have packed the Copacabana is tiny compared to those that watched Jagger . Jagger also loves Brazilians, having fathered one 15 years ago with former Brazilian model Luciana Gimenez. Brazilians' obsession with Jagger's footballing insights, or lack thereof, began four years ago at the World Cup in South Africa. Searching for an explanation for their country's stunning quarterfinal loss to the Netherlands, Brazil's fans settled on Jagger, who showed up at the stadium accompanying his son dressed in a Brazilian shirt. Earlier in that tournament, he had already earned a reputation for picking losers by showing up in the stands with Bill Clinton to cheer on the United States, who lost to Ghana in the second round, and then a day later watched as England were trounced by Germany 4-1.","Jagger has been wrong with all his World Cup predictions so far .

"Bacary Sagna has hit back at critics who labelled him greedy when he quit Arsenal for Manchester City by saying: 'It's not about money – I wanted to boost my career.' The French full-back has finally joined City after months of wrangling, having turned down offers from Arsenal to renew his contract, which ends this month. And after helping France through to the last 16 of the World Cup in Wednesday night's goalless draw with Ecuador in Rio, Sagna hit back at the rumours he had been trying to simply hike up his wages at Arsenal, pointing out that he had been on the same deal at the Emirates for the past six years. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sagna scores incredible volley in France World Cup training . All smiles: Sagna has ended a seven-year spell with Arsenal to sign a three-year £150k-per-week deal at City . Sagna is free to join City when his contract runs out on June 30 and he said: 'I am a City player.' But he was keen to clarify why he turned down Arsene Wenger's offers to stay at Arsenal. 'I’m going to clear everything up because I keep reading that I did it for money and I’m greedy,' he said. 'What I want to say is I have stayed with Arsenal on the same contract since 2008 and I never asked for more money. 'For people who think it’s for money, it’s not. I just wanted to change. I needed a boost in my career and I think it was about time. 'It was not an easy time because we were still involved in the FA Cup and it was hard to stay focused. I stayed focused on my team because I have a lot of respect for Arsenal. 'It’s not easy to read every day things which are wrong most of the time. I told my family to keep away from speculation and I stayed focused.' Tearful exit: Sagna's last game for Arsenal was in their 3-2 FA Cup final victory against Hull City in May . High note: The FA Cup victory was the only trophy Sagna won during his seven-year spell at Arsenal . And although he finally won his first trophy with Arsenal when they beat Hull in the FA Cup final last month, he admits going to join Manuel Pellegrini will give him the chance of Premier League and Champions League glory. 'It is an exciting time for me and my career. I think we have a good team with City and we can do great things. 'Arsenal made me grow up as a player and as a man as well. We finally won a trophy, but it’s not even about that because Arsenal have a quality. 'It’s just that, personally, I wanted a boost. I needed to start again.' And Sagna is not worried about competing with Argentinian star Pablo Zabaletta for the right-back position. 'I know they have a very good right-back in Zabaleta and I will have to fight to find some time on the pitch. But I’m looking forward to it.' Before joining up with his new team-mates, Sagna believes he can help France win the World Cup, with the experience of manager Didier Deschamps a decisive factor. The French crashed out of the past two tournaments after internal rows between players and staff, but Sagna says Deschamps has brought harmony to the camp – and has the experience of winning the World Cup in 1998. He said: 'We have started very well, so we have to be ambitious. 'In the past we were maybe too arrogant, too confident. Sometimes it’s good to start from the bottom. We’ve worked hard as a team for a few years and today we are here. We have managed a good start to the World Cup and we want to go to the end. 'The coach has been a player himself, he's been a world champion so he knows how to manage and lead a team with feeling. 'At the moment I’m not thinking about anything else, I’m giving my maximum to go to the World Cup final.'","Sagna joined Manchester City from Arsenal on a free transfer .

"Uruguay captain Diego Lugano has described Luis Suarez's four-month ban as an act of 'barbarity' that breaches the player's human rights. FIFA suspended Suarez from all football-related activity until the end of October after he bit Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's final group game on Tuesday. Suarez sat out Saturday's second-round match against Colombia and Uruguay suffered without him, falling to a 2-0 defeat thanks to a brace from James Rodriguez. VIDEO Scroll down for FIFA president Sepp Blatter: What Suarez did was not fair . Suspension: Luis Suarez was banned for four months after appearing to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini . Barbaric: Defender Diego Lugano has claimed the ban on Suarez is against the frontman's human rights . After the match, Lugano lashed out at FIFA for imposing the record ban on Suarez. 'It's a breach of human rights that a player cannot go into a stadium where there are 80,000 people or into a hotel with his team-mates, that he cannot work for four months,' the defender said. 'He has committed a crime, but this (ban) is barbarity. 'Not even a criminal would receive this penalty.' Uruguay were weak up front without Suarez in the Maracana, where James Rodriguez scored two stunning goals for Colombia. Diego Forlan, 35, played poorly and Edinson Cavani did not have the same impact as he did against England when he played alongside Suarez. Lugano thinks Uruguay were always going to find it hard to make the quarter-finals without their star man. 'He is irreplaceable,' the former West Brom defender said of Suarez. Seansational strike: James Rodriguez struck against Uruguay with a magnificent effort from outside the box . 'Against Colombia we weren't able to replace the skills he has. 'For years he has been our best player. 'Us losing him is much worse even than Brazil losing Neymar or Argentina losing (Lionel) Messi.' Cavani insisted the Suarez saga had not proved to be too much of a distraction in the build up to the game, though. 'From the moment we knew about the sanction, we only thought about Colombia,' the Paris St Germain striker said.

"A man who hit on a woman in the streets of eastern Kazakhstan got more than he bargained for - he got floored by the response. Kondrat Golubev, 32, had been partying with friends in the city of Atyrau when he went outside for a cigarette and spotted two girls. Initially Mr Golubev asked them if they fancied a drink, but when his offer was rebuffed he changed his tact and asked them how much they charged for sex. Scroll down for video . So how much? Kondrat Golubev asks the women how much they charge for sex in the eastern Kazakhstan city of Atyrau and the response he gets isn't a positive one . I'll hit on you: One of the woman takes offence to the question and punches Mr Golubev in the head . Anatoli Pokrovski, 36, who witnessed the ill-fated pick-up attempt said an argument soon broke out between the trio. He said: 'The women were clearly offended and he never expected what happened next, even though the woman really telegraphed the punch. She hit him so hard he fell flat on the pavement.' Mr Pokrovski said the other women then kicked the man while he was on the ground, before her friend said 'he'd had enough'. He said the pair then walked off as if 'nothing had happened'. Mr Pokrovski said: 'It was pretty shocking really, but what a punch.' Timber: Mr Golubev falls backwards, losing his balance, as the woman delivers a solid right hand blow .

"Ahmed Abu Khatalla is accused of the 2011 attack on the US compound in Benghazi which claimed the life of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others . A Libyan militant accused of the 2012 terrorist attack on the US embassy in Benghazi was told that he faces the death penalty after a grand jury indicted him on 18 charges. Ahmed Abu Khatalla, 43, was captured by US special forces in June and brought to the court where a grand jury decided upon which charges he should face. Khatalla was initially held on one count of conspiracy to support terrorists resulting in the death of US officials. But additional charges were added to the indictment. As a result of the indictment, Khatalla faces multiple death penalty charges. Among the capital charges, Khatalla is accused of the murder of an internationally protected person as well as killing a person in a federal facility. After his arrest, Khatalla was brought to the US on a naval vessel and remains in custody in Alexandra, Virginia. Khatalla has so far pleaded guilty although he is due to return to court in Washington next week. His public defender Michelle Peterson said: 'It is important to remember that an indictment is merely a set of allegations or charges, it is not evidence. We will vigorously defend Mr. Abu Khatallah? in court where the government will be forced to prove his guilt, based upon actual evidence.' Khatalla is accused of being a ringleader in the September 11, 2012 attack which killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other US nationals. It is also claimed that the terrorists ransacked a number of classified computers inside in the compoud. According to prosecutors, Khattala drove to the diplomatic mission with other militants and a group of about 20 breached the main gate and later launched an attack with assault rifles, grenades and other weapons. That initial attack killed Stevens and communications specialist Sean Smith and set the mission ablaze. Prosecutors say Khattala supervised the plunder of sensitive information from that building, then returned to a camp in Benghazi where a large group began assembling for an attack on a second building known as the annex. The attack on that facility, including a precision mortar barrage, resulted in the deaths of security officers Tyrone Snowden Woods and Glen Anthony Doherty, authorities say. US ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens was among four Americans killed in the 2011 terrorist attack . The gunmen attacked the embassy compound in Benghazi and an adjacent CIA facility . Gunmen celebrated inside the compound's perimeter in the aftermath of the attack on September 11, 2011 . In the attack's immediate aftermath, Obama administration officials, including Susan Rice, currently White House national security adviser, stoked political controversy by initially saying the attack was a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim video that had surfaced in the United States. Evidence later emerged that U.S. agencies had been warning for months about weak security and possible attacks against U.S. facilities in Libya. Evidence also emerged that soon after the attack, the United States had strong reason to believe that organized militant groups had been involved. In media interviews before his capture by U.S. forces, Khatallah denied involvement in the attacks against a compound used by the State Department as a consular office and a nearby compound used by the CIA as its Benghazi base. The new U.S. indictment alleges Khatallah had been the commander of an militant Islamist militia called Ubaydah bin Jarrah. That group later merged with another Libyan group called Ansar al Sharia, and Khatallah became one of its Benghazi-based leaders, U.S. authorities said.","Ahmed Abu Khatalla is believed to have masterminded the 2011 terror attack .

"Argentina fans have mocked stricken Brazil star Neymar after they were filmed celebrating with a spinal chord skeleton. Coach Alejandro Sabella ignored his country's bitter rivalry with Brazil when he said 'football had shed a tear' after Neymar was ruled out of the World Cup, but it would seem the their fans aren't quite as sympathetic. Neymar, who has carried Brazil to the semi-finals, suffered a broken vertebrae during the 2-1 quarter-final win against Colombia on Friday and will miss the rest of the tournament. The Argentina fans have since been filmed waving a spinal column in the air while chanting what seems to be a cheap shot at the Brazilian star's back injury.

Agony: Neymar clutches his back after going down injured during Brazil's win over Colombia on Friday . Sabella, however, was much more sympathetic, saying: 'When I played football, I was a skilful No 10... so I like to see football played well, and I am delighted by great players. 'When a team loses a player of such great qualities, it's as if football has shed a tear.' 'One feels sad, not just as a coach and but as a spectator,' Sabella added after his side beat Belgium 1-0 to join Brazil in the last four. 'The worst thing that can happen to a player is to get injured, especially at a crucial moment of a World Cup which he has been dreaming about for so long, and working towards for so long.

"Plans by the health watchdog to allow relatives to spy on poor care homes have been branded an ‘admission of failure.’ The Care Quality Commission will this month publish guidelines setting out how families can place hidden cameras in the rooms of their loved ones if they suspect abuse. It follows several harrowing cases that were only uncovered by relatives or whistleblowers taking matters into their own hands and secretly filming the treatment of carers. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Faderera Grace Bello abusing a 92-year-old. She was jailed for four months in June . But critics say the CQC is not doing enough to monitor care standards, while the care home industry says it is unacceptable for filming to be encouraged. The watchdog insists covert filming should be used only as a last resort after families have raised concerns with it and with care home managers. But Stephen Burke, chief executive of the Good Care Guide, a TripAdvisor-style website for care homes, said: ‘The fact that the CQC are sanctioning people to undertake secret filming suggests that the system is not working. That’s a huge admission of its own failings as an inspector of care. ‘We would expect the CQC to pay much more attention to what families are saying. If the families are flagging up that there a problem, a worry, serious concern, we would expect the CQC to be in there... and tackle the early signs of poor care before it’s too late. ‘The key to improving care is not by introducing a Big Brother-style culture but to ensure the industry is well inspected, regulated and staff are properly trained, supervised and managed while punishing those who provide inadequate care.’ Professor Martin Green, chief executive of Care England, which represents private care homes said: ‘It’s unacceptable to give the green light for people to do covert filming. Where is the choice of the older person in all that? I’m at a loss as to why the regulator is coming out with this as a position.’ Bridget Rees was secretly filmed being abused by Faderera Grace Bello, 54, pictured, a staff nurse at an NHS care home . In 2012, the family of Gladys Wright, 79, secretly filmed carers pushing her and swearing at her at a £800-a-week home in Somerset. One employee was later jailed. The family of 92-year-old Bridget Rees, suspicious after noticing bruises on her arms and legs, secretly filmed a carer throwing objects at her face, poking her, slapping her and swearing at her at a North London nursing home. As a result, Faderera Grace Bello was jailed for four months in June. And in April, BBC1’s Panorama secretly filmed staff ignoring the cries of a 98-year-old woman while another was seen being slapped. It resulted in seven staff being sacked from the home in Essex. The CQC guidelines, to be published this month, will also set out how managers can covertly film staff they suspect of abuse. Andrea Sutcliffe, CQC chief inspector of adult social care, said providers and relatives will be advised what issues they need to take into account when filming, adding: ‘Respecting the dignity of people is central.’ The CQC has just begun tough new inspections of all 25,000 care homes and home help services in England. Teams of three or four inspectors will give an Ofsted-style rating from outstanding to poor. It follows several high-profile scandals, including the shocking abuse of adults at Winterbourne View in Bristol, exposed by a Panorama investigation in 2011. The CQC had passed the home as safe and ignored the concerns of a whistleblower. It also gave Furness General Hospital in Cumbria a clean bill of health in 2010, even though up to 14 women and two babies are feared to have died needlessly in the past decade. It emerged that the CQC’s former chief executive, Cynthia Bower, and chair, Jill Finney, tried to cover up a failed inspection although both deny the claims.

Brazil’s . squad contains five players who did not even play what would amount to a . full season in their domestic league before departing - including Hulk, . whose career at home amounts to one game for Vitoria of Salvador in . 2004. So when France and Germany meet tonight in the Maracana Stadium . in Rio de Janeiro, it should be with no inferiority complex about what . lies ahead. Europe will be guaranteed at least one  representative in the semi-finals, perhaps as many as three. Indeed, . the most eye-catching, emphatic  performances of the competition so far - Spain 1 Holland 5, Germany 4 Portugal 0, France 5  Switzerland 2 - . have come from the Europeans, even if the outstanding individuals - . Neymar, Lionel Messi, James Rodriguez, Luis Suarez - have been South . American. High five! Holland's emphatic victory over Spain was one of the outstanding matches of the World Cup so far . VIDEO Team Profile: Netherlands highlights . Progressed: Romelu Lukaku scores against USA to see Belgium make it through to the quarter-finals . Icon: Mario Kempes was the only member of the 1978 Argentina World Cup squad not to play in his homeland . Times have changed. A trip to the southern hemisphere is no . longer so daunting for players who travel in the Champions League on an . almost weekly basis and regularly undertake pre-season or mid-season . trips to distant continents. In 1930, when the first World Cup was . held in Uruguay, the four European participants, Belgium, France, . Romania and Yugoslavia, all left on the same ship, along with the three . European referees, FIFA president Jules Rimet and what was to become his . trophy. The hosts won, but it wasn’t a complete disaster for the . European visitors. Yugoslavia beat Brazil and Bolivia, Romania defeated . Peru and France got the better of Mexico. Only Belgium did not record a . victory over a continental rival. In 1950, when the World Cup came . to Brazil the last time, the prospect of travelling across the Atlantic . was still so alien that Scotland, Turkey, Portugal and France qualified . but chose not to compete. The group stage record of the European clubs . against South and Central American opponents, then, is very creditable: . they lost only two of 10 games, and won six. Nothing to fear: France have impressed at this summer's tournament having breezed through the group stage . Team effort: Germany have been seen one of the tournament's favourites since before it started . VIDEO Team Profile: Germany highlights . In 1962, in Chile, six . of the eight quarter-finalists were European, even if Brazil defeated . Czechoslovakia in the final. So the idea that it is impossible for a . European country to win on South American soil, while evidence-based to . here, is not unreasonably challenged. Certainly, the Germans, who . have not failed to make it beyond the World Cup’s group stage since . 1938, looked very at home at their Rio de Janeiro hotel base on Thursday. A . viral illness had affected a number of the squad, but those who were . fit and able happily bathed in the sun by the swimming pool, signing . autographs, posing for photographs and looking very relaxed. Bastian . Schweinsteiger went for a walk along the beachfront alone and returned . surrounded by an excited mob. There were screams and squeals from . supporters kept behind barriers every time a player made an appearance . on his balcony. The player waved, the fans squealed some more, and some . held up perfectly inscribed pieces of card, explaining why they needed . a T-shirt signed. Very ordered autograph hunters, the Germans. None . of this chasing Mesut Ozil down the road shouting, ‘Oi mate’. They . would have an  Arsenal replica shirt, with his name on the back, plus a . legible, formal, written request clearly displayed and a black marker . pen ready. It was almost as if, instinctively, they knew the drill. Being German, they probably did. Settled: Germany have made themselves at home at their Rio De Janeiro base this summer . Considering the envy for this German team in England, there is a surprising swirl of dissent around . Joachim Low and his selections. There is criticism of his back four, . which amounts to a quartet of  centre-halves, and fury that this means . he now plays Philipp Lahm in midfield, echoing his new role under Pep . Guardiola at Bayern Munich. Further negative Catalan influence is seen . in Low’s preference for a false nine, with the squad’s only striker, . Miroslav Klose, on the bench. Fine when putting four past Portugal, less . so when taken to extra time by Algeria. Certainly, Lahm will have . his work cut out on Friday night, up against arguably the most powerful central . midfielder in the competition, Paul Pogba of France. Comparisons with . Patrick Vieira now seem very apposite, although in time the Arsenal man . thinks they will come to flatter him. He feels Pogba is more capable of . changing games going forward, and is probably right. Even so, . Germany remain narrow favourites. ‘We have big ambitions, more than ever . now we are in the last eight,’ said Chelsea’s Andre Schurrle. ‘When you . come to a World Cup with Germany, you are expected to win it.’ Ozil was . in agreement. ‘We would be legends as the first European team to win in . South America,’ he added. 'We can beat anyone on our day.’ Star man: France midfielder Paul Pogba has been compared to compatriot Patrick Vieira . VIDEO Team Profile: France highlights . IIt will . be hot at the Maracana, 30 degrees, but there was a heatwave in Germany . in the 2006 World Cup, too. Certainly the climate hasn’t been the killer . of European ambitions that many suspected. Manaus was difficult, but . when England played Uruguay in Sao Paulo, for instance, the temperature . was more conducive to a European team than a South American one. Germany . think the debilitating bug may have been caused by a  sudden drop in . temperature in  miserable Porto Alegre, having got used to the sunshine . of Recife. Given the vast travelling distances involved, jetlag seems . more of an issue than sunstroke right now. How great a part will be . played by continental allegiance, though, remains to be seen. Does the . fact that Brazil and Argentina have almost as many players who are based . in Europe - 18 and 19 respectively - as either Germany, France, Holland . or Belgium mean South America’s advantage on their own continent is at . an end? The locals even have a name for the Brazilians who play . abroad - estrangeiros, they call them.  Foreigners. Of the four still . based in Brazil, two are the reserve  goalkeepers, Jefferson and Victor. The first-choice goalkeeper, Julio Cesar, now plays for Toronto. Strangers: Brazilians who play in Europe, like goalkeeper Julio Cesar, are called foreigners by fans . Maybe . that is why the Brazilian national anthem is sung with such passion and . conviction by the team, some with tears running down  their cheeks. Exiles are often the  ones who most crave emotional  connection with the . homeland. Low, Germany’s coach, even believes this is a potent force . that makes the South Americans harder to beat. ‘They are all at home . here, but it is not just about that,’ he said. ‘The South Americans, . even the Central Americans, want to show their class on their home . continent. They want to show the world “This is where we come from”. They will do whatever is necessary to satisfy the fans and the nation. They are strong teams anyway, so with that, it is no  surprise to me . that they play well. You can feel that emotion.’ For a while, though, . the Maracana Stadium will echo to old world rivalries tomorrow, but . estrangeiros await the winner in the semi-final. That will decide what . matters in Brazil: where you’re from, or where you’re at.","The four World Cups held in South America have all been won by a South American team .

The Copacabana Palace is also the hotel where all the senior FIFA executives are staying, and the latest police involvement is another embarrassment for the world governing body. Jaime Byrom, executive chairman of MATCH, and Whelan's brother-in-law, said in a statement released earlier on Thursday: 'Notwithstanding our belief that the action taken against Mr Whelan was illegal and baseless, MATCH Services and I personally remain totally committed to assist the authorities from the 18th Precinct [police] or any other jurisdiction in FIFA's fight against illegal ticket sales.'

"The owner of the yacht where Natalie Wood spent her final moments has put it on the market after claiming the actress still haunts the decks. Ron Nelson bought The Splendour in 1986, five years after the West Side Story actress mysteriously drowned off the coast of Catalina Island. But now, 28 years later, he has revealed the force of Wood's spirit is too strong, forcing him to get rid of it altogether. Scroll down for video . Haunted? The new owner of The Splendour claims Natalie Wood still haunts the yacht 33 years after she died . Mystery: Wood drowned in November 1981 after being on the yacht with her husband Robert Wagner . The numerous 'supernatural' incidents include a number of 'weird falls', he told the National Enquirer. 'It’s just like my feet came out from under me and I fell,' he explained. Another time a being sat on his bed: 'Something sat down on the bed and then left.' And during the recent Hurricane Ana, The Splendour became suspiciously waterlogged, he said. In 2011, Nelson, a former United Airlines flight attendant, admitted to Hawaii's KITV.com that 'there's been a lot of strange things that have happened on the boat.' He even had the yacht blessed by two Hawaiian kahunas - a kind of shaman - to clean teh boat's spirit. Incidents? Ron Nelson, who bought the boat in 1986, claims he has had a number of 'weird falls' on board . 'Ghost': Nelson said he was lying in bed one night and a spirit came and sat on the bed then left . But despite his efforts, he says, it is unbearable. He hopes a museum will buy The Splendour to preserve it. The stateroom contains many of the same tiles, the same blue bed remains in exactly the same spot and the initials WW are still etched into the captain's seat. Nelson bought the boat from Robert Wagner, Wood's husband. He carried out small renovations, before taking two friends on a trip to Catalina Island, where the actress died. He said it was a 'last goodbye to Natalie'. Afterwards, they made the two week trip to Hawaii where he has spent 10 years restoring the boat. He said he was now almost ready to begin chartering voyages. Hurricane: The boat became waterlogged after the recent Hurricane Ana - the last straw for spooked Nelson . Blessed but still haunted: Nelson got two Hawaiian shaman to cleanse the boat but it is 'still haunted', he says . He said he tried to keep his makeover as close to the original as possible, and has kept the stateroom with the blue bed, dubbed 'Natalie's Room', and most of the tiles. The initials WW are still etched onto the captain's seat, just as they were when Wagner and Natalie owned the boat. Nelson said the 60ft boat's history was one of the reasons why he bought it, and told Hawaii's KITV.com said: 'I have read pretty much every article ever written about her death.'","Natalie Wood 'haunts The Splendour yacht' where she was last seen alive .

"Accused murderer Gable Tostee has dumped his lawyer in favour of another just before he launches a second bail application attempt. The 28-year-old has spent the last month in police custody following the death of 26-year-old New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright who he met on dating app Tinder before she plunged to her death from the 14th floor of his Gold Coast apartment's balcony. Tostee has reportedly dismissed his former lawyer Michael Purcell and instead sought representation from Robertson O'Gorman Solicitors, headed by Terry O'Gorman, the Courier Mail reports. The legal change comes not long after Mr O'Gorman publicly slammed the released of court documents allegedly detailing phone recordings found by police on Tostee's phone. Scroll down for video . Gable Tostee was last month charged with the murder of Warriena Wright after she fell from the balcony of his apartment in Gold Coast, Queensland, on August 8. Tostee has denied the charge . The transcripts, which were filed by Queensland police in the Brisbane Supreme Court in opposition to Mr Tostee's bail application, allegedly detail minute-by-minute conversations between Tostee and Ms Wright inside apartment 1404 just before her death on August 8. They reveal controversial comments including the moment a male voice was heard saying 'you are lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony, you goddamn psycho little b****'. Following the transcripts' publication across a variety of media outlets, Mr O'Gorman expressed his concern over the threat it caused to justice, saying it was 'absolutely worrying'. 'There is a view that access to court documents in respect of matters before the court has the potential to prejudice potential jurors at a later date,' Mr O'Gorman told The Brisbane Times. Tostee has reportedly dismissed his former lawyer Michael Purcell and instead sought representation from Robertson O'Gorman Solicitors, headed by Terry O'Gorman (pictured) 'The question, therefore, has to be asked ... where has the affidavit come from? 'Was it supplied to the media by the police?' Tostee, who has been in police custody for the past month, recently thanked his friends and family on social media for their support. He wrote in the Facebook post: 'To my friends and those who have been supporting me, I want to thank you and say that I miss you all.' 'I have been in custody for almost a month now for a crime I did not commit and have lost contact with almost everyone.' 'I maintain my absolute innocence and hope that this nightmare will be over soon.' New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright met with Tostee after the pair met on mobile dating app Tinder . Gable Tostee posted this message on Facebook while in police custody . An alleged account of Ms Wright's final hours by police claims Tostee held Ms Wright in a 78-second long stranglehold and may have made her drink 'vodka' brewed from a homemade still inside his Surfers Paradise apartment before her death. It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink. Gable Tostee was an active Tinder dater in the months leading up to his meeting Warriena Wright on August 7 . It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly went to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink . Sounds of groaning can be heard, then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, and says 'I don't like being beaten up'. According to documents submitted by police to the court, the sounds of a struggle begin at about 2.10am after the sound of drinks being poured had been heard a few minutes earlier. Over the next few minutes the argument gets worse and at 2.13am the sounds of a struggle are interspersed with his swearing and her saying 'OK, it is all good' while she sounds out of breath. During the 10 minutes leading up to 2.21am he calls her a 'god damn psycho' twice and there are further sounds of the struggle. The transcript allegedly documents Ms Wright's tryst with Tostee, heavy drinking, a violent argument and her fatal fall . 'There are sounds of slapping and [Tostee] saying 'let go, let go'. The sounds of restricted breathing coninue for 78 seconds and only stops when there is the sounds of something dropping and then [Tostee] complains about her trying to hit him. 'At this stage the deceased's airway is no longer restricted and she starts yelling out 'no' repeatedly. 'This escalates in crescendo and anxiety and there are sounds of the balcony door being opened, and scuffling consistent with [Tostee] dragging the deceased towards the balcony.' The Crown continues: 'This part of the struggle' takes just under one minute, commencing 'at 2.19.48am and continues until 2.20.46am, at which point the door can be heard slamming shut leaving the deceased on the balcony and [Tostee] inside the unit. 'The last thing said before the deceased is outside the balcony is her screams intensifying as she screams 'just let me go home'. '[Tostee] says in a very aggressive tone, 'I would but you have been a bad girl'. 'Her voice becomes more muffled and it is apparent she is on the other side of the door. 'At 2.21.12am, one hour, 24 minutes and 25 seconds into the recording, a scream can be heard that fades, consistent with the deceased falling.' A judge on Monday described the charge of murder against Tostee as 'difficult' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony at the time Ms Wright fell to her death. Police have claimed Tostee taunted Ms Wright in his flat when she threatened to call the police after discovering her iPhone was missing . Police have opposed the bail application for Tostee, saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright . It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer . Tostee had an application for bail with the Supreme Court denied by police, who were concerned he had contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright. A document filed in the bail application says: 'police hold a strong belief that if Tostee is granted bail, he will recommence his using social media.' 'Police believe Tostee's blatant disregard for human life and his propensity of violence displayed in this instance would place the safety of the community at an unacceptable risk.'

"Amazon is planning to open its first physical store in Manhattan, it has been claimed. The firm has signed a lease on a building on 34 Street, opposite the Empire State Building, the Wall Street Journal said. It would act as a pickup and returns centre for customers, as well as a showroom for the firm's Kindle line. Amazon's new store will be opposite the Empire State Building. It will act as a pickup and returns centre for customers, as well as a showroom for the firm's Kindle line. In some locations, instead of delivering a parcel an address, Amazon customers can opt for their purchases to be dropped at a locker location. This removes the risk of being out when it is delivered in the post. Once the parcel arrives at the locker, the buyer will get an e-mail notification with a unique pick-up code and a barcode. The email will also include details of when the lockers - often located in stores - are open. When the customer arrives at the locker, they then enter the pick-up code or scan the barcode, releasing the package. Opening a physical location is 'about marketing the Amazon brand,' said Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analys told the WSJ. 'Same-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that.' People familiar with the matter cautioned that Amazon's plans could change, and that the store is an experiment and could be deemed unsuccessful. If it is successful, however, the New York location could presage a rollout to other U.S. cities,it is claimed. The 12-story building on 34th Street, owned by Vornado Realty Trust, once housed an Ohrbach's department store and now has Mango and Express stores at street level. There are two loading docks at the back of the building, useful for bringing merchandise in and out. It is believed the location was chosen to take advantage of the footfall of tourists. The Empire State Building last year attracted 4.3 million visitors to its observatory, and Macy's flagship store nearby draws more than 20 million annual visitors.

"There is something magical about the No 10 shirt. Something mystical. Spiritual almost. It is the shirt of the World Cup gods. The shirt of the Hand of God. The shirt of god-given football talent. Wear it in the heavenly tradition and immortality can beckon. Here in Brazil a veritable host are knocking on the door of No 10. Seeking the power. Most of you can name them: Neymar, Messi, Benzema. Yes, and then who? VIDEO Scroll down to watch James Rodriguez hone his free kick taking . Iconic: Neymar's four goals have carried Brazil into the knockout stages . Magical: Lionel Messi has also scored four goals in Brazil as Argentina prepare to face Switzerland in the last 16 . Not Wayne Rooney. The No 10 can be a curse, too. One goal in three World Cups. A tap-in at that. Back home already. To be conferred with the No 10 is an honour but you accept it at your peril. Deliver or stand condemned forever. So, who else? The more dedicated students of the game will be aware of him, but James Rodriguez will be a stranger to the majority. Yet Senor Rodriguez has already scored three goals at Brazil 2014, the same as Benzema and just one behind Neymar and Lionel Messi. At just 22. For Colombia. The team who arrived here as nobody’s favourites, outside Bogota and the old drugs capitals such as Medellin, are suddenly in the last 16. And now hardly anybody is betting against them beating Uruguay. We tend to associate Colombian football with Bobby Moore being falsely accused of pilfering a bracelet there en route to the World Cup finals of Mexico 1970. Or defender Andres Escobar being killed after Colombia exited the competition in 1994. Now we have a much better reason to pay attention. Namely James David Rodriguez Rubio. New hero: Colombia's James Rodriguez . has starred with goals and assists . Leader of the dance: Colombia have won three out of three games and face a Uruguay without Luis Suarez . So far at this World Cup he has scored one and made two against Greece, headed one and made one against the Ivory Coast and scored one and made two against Japan despite resting on the bench until the second half. This young man slipped into Porto under the radar from club football in his native country and Argentina. He arrived in Portugal clutching a host of youth football honours, team and individual, but virtually unknown in Europe. Porto won their league title in each of the three years he was with them. He became the youngest player to be awarded Portugal’s Golden Ball. Someone was paying attention. Someone who is no stranger to football and the world beyond football. Sir Alex Ferguson has not formally confirmed that United offered Porto €30 million last year to take Rodriguez to Manchester United. What he does say on the record is brief and revealing: ‘This lad is a game-changer.’ And not just because he scores a few goals — 61 in 223 senior appearances, eight of them in his first 25 matches for Colombia. The real beauty of Rodriguez is his creativity, his orchestrating of the play with such elegance that there seem to be times when even the most hostile of opponents cannot help but stand back and admire. He's electric: Rodriguez nods Colombia ahead against Ivory Coast . A star is born: Rodriguez has justified the hype with some wonderful displays for Colombia . When he was emerging from the cocoon of boyhood they could not work out whether he was a winger, a midfield player or a forward. What we are coming to realise at this tournament is that he is something which is simpler but more profound. A footballer. An inspiration: Carlos Valderrama took Colombia to the last 16 in Italia 90 . Is he left-footed or right-footed? Take your choice. Is he a goal-maker or a goal-taker? You pay your money and you take your choice. In the case of AS Monaco you pay €45m while United are dithering. You make him the most expensive footballer ever to come out of Colombia, one of the most expensive in the world. You pay the money even though you know he trains to be lithe and elusive rather than modern and muscle-powered. Rodriguez  prefers to play the beautiful rather than bruising game. Perhaps that is why he is blossoming in Brazil. Although he is clean-cut, his hero is Carlos Valderrama, the bohemian virtuoso with the hedge-like blond afro hair who inspired Colombia to over-perform in World Cups past. ‘I actually met Mr Valderrama once,’ he says with touching respect. ‘I always admired him a lot. He was not only a great player but a great person and very intelligent. He gave a lot of happiness to our country.’ When it is mentioned that he might be talking about himself in the very near future, he says: ‘I only hope I can do the same.’ If so, it will be in similar, fantasy style. Like Valderrama, young Rodriguez seems to float through even the most frenzied matches as if on a cloud of dreams. Warning signs: Rodriguez had this goal disallowed fo Porto against Manchester city in the Europa League . Big-money move: Rodriguez moved to Monaco from Porto for ¿45m . In the tradition of most great players, he finds time and space amidst the maelstrom. And as  Ferguson observed, he uses it to prise open the most robust defences with the most delicately penetrating passes. At times he is an illusionist, making the ball reappear in the most unexpected places. If United’s bid failed it may have more to do with the style of football he prefers than the money. Life's a beach: Radamel Falcao relaxes in Miami while his team-mates forge a path into the knockout stages . There is talk of him moving again soon, to an even more major league than the French.But when that possibility is raised he says, with both charm and candour: ‘The Premier League is very physical. In Spain, for  example, it is more about the  technique and guile which can give a player like me more touches of the ball. That is what I love about playing this game.’ That is why fellow Colombians love him. When their initial hope for a successful World Cup, the  at-times brilliant Radamel Falcao, was deprived by injury of the  biggest moment of his career, depression descended. Then along came James, to drive them south to Brazil in their scores of thousands, following their new Pied Piper. He says: ‘Having the World Cup in Brazil, where so many of our fans can travel, is enormous for us.’ Valderrama was nicknamed El Pibe, The Kid. Now they call Rodriguez El Nuevo Pibe, The New Kid.While Brazil and Argentina await the ascensions of Neymar and Messi, could it be that Colombia have found their Pele, their  Maradona, their new Valderrama? Rodriguez will be 23 the day before the World Cup final at the mighty Maracana on July 13. Might he still be here to celebrate? If he is, if he leaves here as the number one No 10. His throne in the pantheon awaits.","Neymar, Lionel Messi and Karim Benzema are shining in the most iconic shirt in football .

At one point he was seen gesturing with his hand before he placed it across his face in an act of apparent despair.

An error occurred and this error was fatal. Missing: Scolari shares a hug with injured Brazil star Neymar (centre) Out: The Brazil squad trained for the first time since their 7-1 World Cup semi-final defeat against Germany . 'If I could explain what happened in those six minutes, I would answer. But I do not know. 'We can lose by one or two but we lost in a way that we had never done before in the history of Brazilian football.' Earlier on Thursday, Scolari was called 'an old jerk' and 'repulsive' by injured star Neymar's agent. Ribeiro produced a list of 'six requirements to be Brazilian coach' and proceeded to belittle many achievements in Scolari's managerial career. He wrote on his Twitter account: 'One - being Portugal Coach and winning nothing.' Last chance: Brazil will play Holland in the 2014 World Cup third place play-off . 'Two - going to Chelsea and being sacked the following day.' 'Three - going to coach in Uzbekistan.' 'Four - returning to Brazil, taking over a big team [Palmeiras] and getting them relegated to the second division.' Low point: David Luiz will be hoping to get over his poor performance against Germany . 'Five - leaving the club 56 days before the end of the Brasileirao [season] to 'escape' the relegation. 'Six - being an old jerk, arrogant, repulsive, conceited and ridiculous.' Ribeiro's outburst seemed to echo public opinion after Brazil's heavy defeat to Germany. The final whistle had barely sounded when the media turned on the Selecao. Main man: Neymar (left) joined his team-mates out on the training field . Some newspapers said they 'learned what real shame is', others told Scolari to 'go to hell', and another told their readers to write their own front page. And their damning analysis of Brazil's performance reached the people, too, after every copy of every newspaper sold out at Belo Horizonte airport.

"To say Diego Maradona’s presence will loom large as Argentina try to win the World Cup for the first time since 1986 does not go far enough. His face will be in the Maracana dressing room before kick-off and on the pitch too. So fond is Ezequiel Lavezzi of Maradona, and body art for that matter, he has a tattoo of the national icon heading a ball inked on to his hip. It is a startling tribute to a player Lavezzi has  himself been compared with. Lionel Messi does not hold the patent on such matters. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ezequiel Lavezzi slap Argentina staff member on the team bus . All smiles: Ezequiel Lavezzi (centre) laughing in training ahead of the World Cup final on Sunday . Clearly Messi is the one doing his utmost to retell the narrative from Mexico 86, when a modest group was propelled to glory thanks to a diminutive virtuoso of huge talent. But were the Barcelona star to have another match of minimal impact, as against Holland in the semi-final, then others will need to step up to beat Germany. Lavezzi could be that man. He is another stocky forward of skill and speed, and earned that Maradona comparison by becoming a hero at Napoli. Those fans adored him as one third of a triumvirate with Edinson Cavani and Marek Hamsik as Napoli challenged for Serie A and won Coppa Italia. There is a rock ’n’ roll edge to his personality that echoes Maradona, demonstrated by several tattoos, including an evil clown on his shoulder and a handcuffed pocket-watch on his back, alongside portraits of Jesus and the Virgin Mary (his Christian name means ‘God strengthens’). Hero: Diego Maradona lifts the World Cup in 1986 after being the star of the tournament . Passion: Lavezzi celebrates with team-mates after Argentina beat Belgium . After a Champions League game against Manchester City  in 2011, Lavezzi was seen with Sergio Aguero opening a bottle of beer with his teeth and he once said: ‘If I have a chance to party then I will, no problem.’ Rather than Maradona, Lavezzi would reference a likeness to Carlos Tevez, sharing a dogged personality fused with nimbleness, vision and bursts of pace. Those are the attributes Lavezzi has brought to this World Cup with his influence growing as the tournament has progressed. Coming on as a late substitute against Iran he passed to Messi then darted into the area, creating just enough uncertainty for Messi to curl in a superb winner. Injuries to Angel Di Maria and Aguero have promoted Lavezzi to starting roles and against  Holland he was one of the better players, bustling into space and linking play, albeit unable to  conjure a moment of magic. Devoted: Lavezzi has a tattoo of his hero Maradona on the side of his body . Stars: Both Messi (foreground) and Lavezzi (background) have been nominated for the Golden Ball award . At 29, he has reached the  pinnacle of his career, winning two Ligue 1 titles after moving to Paris St-Germain for €30million. He holds his own in a team including Zlatan Ibrahimovic. And yet at 17 he gave up the game, frustrated in the lower  levels of Argentina, and spent 18 months out as an apprentice electrician. Estudiantes offered him a way back then, and Chelsea are reported to be interested now — little wonder after he has twice pulled them apart in the Champions League. In 2012 he scored a brace in Naples and this year once in Paris. He has suffered heartache away from football too. In February he celebrated a goal by pointing to the skies days after his uncle Jorge, his first coach, had been shot dead in Rosario. Humour remains though, and he was caught on camera  squirting water over Argentina manager Alejandro Sabella  during the World Cup group stage clash with Nigeria. Others managers might have hooked him on the spot, but Sabella is more relaxed, which is useful when there is a World Cup to be won and Lavezzi could provide the spark to seal it.","Lavezzi has the chance to evoke memories of Maradona in 1986 .

"Ex-CIA agent Tony Mendez disclosed his Parkinson's disease earlier this month alongside his wife and fellow former spy, Jonna Mendez. The Mendezes attended a Focused Ultrasound Foundation symposium in October where they broke the news of his disorder, The Washington Post reported. 'If we can fill a room, to get a bunch of people to listen, whether it’s about ""Argo,"" whether it’s about ""This is how I deal with Parkinson’s"" … then this is just his latest operation,' Jonna Mendez told the newspaper. Speaking out: Tony Mendez, seen at the 2013 Oscars in this file photo, disclosed he has Parkinson's disease earlier this month . On the big screen: Ben Affleck portrayed Mendez in the 2012 movie 'Argo' Ben Affleck portrayed Mendez in the 2012 film, in a dramatized account of how the real-life CIA agent helped a group of Americans safely get out of Iran. The couple attempted to cover up his illness during the publicity blitz stemming from 'Argo,' The Washington Post reported. 'He really had trouble accepting that diagnosis,' Jonna Mendez told the newspaper. 'I think [Ben Affleck] just thought that was Tony's demeanor,' she also said. 'But Tony was never taciturn before Parkinson’s.' Tony Mendez told The Washington Post 'We got to a spot in the disease where it’s not gonna be much fun living. So out of desperation you go back to your physician and go, ""What else you got?""' His condition has improved following the implantation of an electrode into his brain, The Washington Post reported. Bravery: Mendez is seen meeting President Jimmy Carter in this 1980 file photo . Escape: Mendez had a group of Americans pretend to be members of the film industry in order to get out of Iran . Meanwhile, he and his wife are interested in the potential for how Focused Ultrasound may help with Parkinson's, according to the newspaper. Jonna Mendez recently told The Times 'We were both chief of disguises at the CIA separated by ten years and, I’ve said this to Tony many times, for this Parkinson’s, I’ve been his disguise. I just tried to hide what was going on there.' She also told the newspaper 'At the Golden Globes, he was on stage with John Goodman. We practised and practised, but it was so hard. Tony muffed his line, but it was almost endearing, it was like, ""Oh, he’s a real person, not a movie star who can do this in his sleep."" He looked kind of cute.' Michael J. Fox reportedly reached out to Mendez at the awards ceremony and gave the former spy his phone number, according to the newspaper. Tony Mendez told The Times he was not upset with the diagnosis, saying 'No, I took an ‘it’s not happening to me’ attitude. I have used that positive thinking elsewhere in my life and I was fairly confident I could do it again. But time will tell. Everybody’s gotta croak some day.' More information on Focused Ultrasound Treatment can be found at the webpage for The Focused Ultrasound Foundation. Advocates: Both Tony Mendez and his wife Jonna Mendez worked for the CIA.

"It is the only all-European quarter-final of this World Cup and perhaps the most intriguing; two countries with three final appearances between them since 1998. France are building momentum from an unfancied position, Germany are stuttering a little among plenty of expectation. Each will play a variation on 4-3-3, with France fielding a more compact midfield and Germany a less-obvious centre-forward. But it will come down to how the players perform. Here is Sportsmail’s analysis of the probable starting line-ups. Scroll down to see the final score . Masters: Germany are looking to reach their fourth consecutive World Cup semi-final . Together: The French squad, who have surprised many, show their team spirit in training . Goalkeeper . Hugo Lloris (Tottenham Hotspur) - Age 27, Caps 61 . Captain has performed well and enhanced his reputation in Brazil. Some fine saves coupled with an alertness for danger. The extinguisher: Lloris has continued his fine form for Tottenham into the World Cup . Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich) - Age 28, Caps 49 . Operated more like a sweeper in the extra-time victory over Algeria and dominates his area. Can be rushed on kicks. Sweeper-keeper: Manuel Neuer let nothing get past him, or in front of him, in the win over Algeria . Verdict: Two goalkeepers magnetically repelled to their own goal-line, Neuer edges it by stature and big-match experience. VIDEO All Star XI: Manuel Neuer highlights . Right-back . Mathieu Debuchy (Newcastle United) - Age 28, Caps 24, Goals 2 . Arsene Wenger wants him to replace Bacary Sagna at Arsenal. He gets the nod for his nation in any case. Dependable and an attacking threat. Wanted man: Debuchy is being tracked by Arsenal as a replacement for Frenchman Bacary Sagna . Jerome Boateng (Bayern Munich) - Age 25, Caps 43 . Shifted to right-back by Philipp Lahm’s move to midfield, the position is not his best. Perfectly capable and good on the ball but looks odd. Odd ball: Boateng has had to fill in at right-back, and could be Germany's weak link in Rio . Verdict: Debuchy is playing in his preferred position and will be more comfortable than Boateng. Left-back . Patrice Evra (Manchester United) - Age 33, Caps 61 . Ageing limbs led to criticism at Manchester United but he has blossomed in Brazil, putting in shifts of pace and poise. Experience: Evra has shown he still has it in the locker in Brazil after some uneasy times at Old Trafford . Benedikt Howedes (Schalke) - Age 26, Caps 25, Goals 2 . Flexibility across the back-line gives Germany greater options and as club captain for Schalke offers leadership. Nothing spectacular. Solid: Benedikt Howedes has justified his selection at left-back during the World Cup . Verdict: Another position where a specialist looks a surer bet, while Evra also brings huge experience. Centre-back . Mamadou Sakho (Liverpool) - Age 24, Caps 22, Goals 2 . The man with the intense eyes and intense style has begun to show why Liverpool paid £18million for him. Athletic if a little erratic. Rebuilding reputation: Sakho (below) has shown why Liverpool splashed the cash on him last summer . Per Mertesacker (Arsenal) - Age 29, Caps 102, Goals 4 . Developed into a favourite at Arsenal and is a composed character on and off field. Towering presence while immobility made up for by anticipation. Cleared: Mertesacker was on the form of his life last season, and has brought his confidence to Brazil . Verdict: Mertesacker has an ability to organise that Sakho does not – could be key with malleable opposition attacks. Centre-back . Raphael Varane (Real Madrid) - Age 21, Caps 10 . Looks at ease on this stage for a 21-year-old. Silky smooth in possession and a threat from corners. Rock: Real Madrid centre-half Varane looks to have experience way beyond his years . Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) - Age 25, Caps 33, Goals 3 . Brings blood and thunder from Borussia Dortmund and a high level of technical proficiency. Towering: Hummels (right) goes up for a challenge with USA's Jermaine Jones in the 1-0 group stage win . Verdict: Real Madrid’s Varane may be young but can become a great. He pips the elder man. Centre-midfield . Yohan Cabaye (PSG) - Age 28, Caps 33, Goals 3 . Has shone for France in deeper role, dictating play from in front of the back four and advancing to unleash trademark shots from range. Poise: PSG midfielder Cabaye has dropped deeper for France, and the team have benefited . Philipp Lahm (Bayern Munich) - Age 30, Caps 110, Goals 5 . The Pep Guardiola experiment continues for the national team. Quite astonishing he can adapt so seamlessly to such a degree. Next up: Philipp Lahm applauds the fans after their narrow 2-1 win over Algeria . Verdict: A very close call. Lahm is the more established, even if newer to this position, and his wealth of knowledge vital. Centre-midfield . Blaise Matuidi (PSG) - Age 27, Caps 27, Goals 5 . Has enjoyed a real break-out moment this tournament. Gets France ticking at good tempo and performs essential defensive function too. Surrounded: Matuidi has shone both up and down the pitch during his four appearances . Bastian Schweinsteiger (Bayern Munich) - Age 29, Caps 105, Goals 23 . Has seemed short of his best at the World Cup. At his peak a player who can drive on a team through desire and technique. Midfield man: Germany legend Bastian Schweinsteiger should earn his 106th cap on Friday . Verdict: Matuidi is quietly producing some excellent stuff, in a similar vein to Emmanuel Petit from 1998. Centre-midfield . Paul Pogba (Juventus) - Age 21, Caps 15, Goals 3 . Grows as each match goes by, dominating central areas with strength and finesse. May look like a gazelle but is hard as rhino. Central man: Pogba put in a magnificent midfield performance against Nigeria . Mesut Ozil (Arsenal) - Age 25, Caps 59, Goals 18 . Much like his debut Arsenal season, has sparkled at times and been subdued at others. Can turn a game with a flick of his boot. Hands aloft: Arsenal man Ozil scores his 18th goal for Germany in the 2-1 win over Algeria on Monday . Verdict: Ozil was once a 21-year-old taking the World Cup by storm, but this is Pogba’s time now. Right-wing . Mathieu Valbuena (Marseille) - Age 29, Caps 37, Goals 6 . The personification of a pocket rocket. Small in stature, big on impact. Provides a nimble outlet from defence to ease pressure and cutting edge too. Overjoyed: Valbuena (right) looks delighted as the French secured their place in the quarters . Toni Kroos (Bayern Munich) - Age 24, Caps 48, Goals 5 . Such an elegant player. Through the middle would be his preferred role but the interchangeable nature of this forward trio means he can influence matters. Eye on the prize: Kroos is concentrating on his international duty despite heavy rumours of a transfer . Verdict: Valbuena is in his pomp at this World Cup, and for this match looks a key player. Left-wing . Antoine Griezmann (Real Sociedad) - Age 23, Caps 8, Goals 3 . Surname sounds German, developed his football in Spain, but has emerged as the solution to France’s issue on the left. Very gifted. Winger: Real Sociedad star Griezmann is Les Bleus' answer on the left of midfield . Mario Gotze (Bayern Munich) - Age 22, Caps 33, Goals 10 . Has been one of Germany’s best players at this tournament and offers Thomas Muller support on the goal hunt. Agile and intelligent. Denied: Gotze sees his shot saved by Algeria goalkeeper Rais M'Bolhi during the last 16 game . Verdict: Similar players, both diminutive and excellent on the ball – Gotze edges because of his experience. Centre-forward . Karim Benzema (Real Madrid) - Age 26, Caps 70, Goals 24 . The required spike to France’s attack, has scored goals, created chances and come-of-age at a major international tournament. Up top: Benzema has three goals and two assists in his four appearances at this World Cup . Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich) - Age 24, Caps 53, Goals 21 . Nine World Cup goals in nine matches is some feat for a guy who nobody would recognise as an out-and-out striker. Drifts across the front and will shot on sight. I'm the man: Thomas Muller has scored four and assisted two goals in his four games so far . Verdict: So different, so difficult to compare. Muller is the ultimate scorer at this event though, so he wins out. Managers . Didier Deschamps - in charge since 2012 . Really impressive in his initial squad selection – omitting Samri Nasri for purposes of unity – and has continued during match. Able to rotate his players and tactics accordingly. In charge: Low (left) has been in charge for eight years, while Deschamps has seen a huge improvement . Joachim Low - in charge since 2006 . A master of this team, overseeing development from promise to fruition. Now the challenge is to adorn his work with a trophy. Verdict: A tie. Final score: France 6-5 Germany . VIDEO Team Profile: France highlights .","European heavyweights meet in Rio on Friday, but how do they compare?
Germany, with Mesut Ozil, Thomas Muller and Manuel Neuer, are looking for their fourth straight World Cup semi-final .
Didier Deschamps France won the World Cup in 1998 and reached the final in 2006, and will call upon Paul Pogba and Karim Benzema to do so again .

"At the end, Grigor Dimitrov fell to his knees. For most of the five sets he played against Alexandr Dolgopolov on Friday night, the 11th seed looked like he was down on them and crawling home. It was ropey and inconsistent, rough and erratic. In short, it was not the graceful tennis  typically associated with a player known as Baby Fed and considered to be the ‘best of the rest’ in men’s tennis. But he came through, scrapping for a 6-7, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-1  victory that carries him into the fourth round here for the first time. Main man: Grigor Dimitrov celebrates after defeating Alexandr Dolgopolov in their singles match . Good game: Dimitrov battled for five sets with Alexandr Dolgopolov before emerging victorious . The 23-year-old had his share of luck along the way, at one stage drawing an animated flapping of the arms from Dolgopolov after his fourth favourable net cord in a matter of minutes. Ultimately it was his superior nerve that made the difference, not to mention the fitness that has come since he linked up with coach Roger Rasheed last October. He was out of sorts in the first set, which Dolgopolov took on a tiebreak, and continued to struggle to find his range as he levelled in the second. ‘The Dog’, gifted but temperamental, took the third before Dimitrov found his reserves of extra strength. He broke in the ninth game of the fourth . and the Ukrainian’s spirit vanished, as the 25-year-old coughed up three . breaks in a 20-minute fifth set. Dimitrov said: ‘Alex is a great competitor, especially on grass. He started pressuring me from the start with great serves. ‘I couldn’t do much in the first set but I got my act together and in the end I was just too strong. ‘I have put in a lot of work and I knew nothing would go to waste. I really wanted it. I knew that even though I was not at my level, I had the fuel. I am into the second week so let’s see what happens.’ Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, meanwhile, can finally have a day off. The No 14 seed played from Monday through to Friday because of two five-set matches suspended overnight for bad light and rain — so he could do with a breather. A 6-2, 6-2, 7-5 victory over qualifier Jimmy Wang from Taiwan elicited his trademark twirl of celebration and permits him the opportunity of a weekend’s rest. In action: Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has played on every day of Wimbledon so far . He will probably need it, because up next comes Novak Djokovic, the man who has done most to deprive Tsonga of a Grand Slam title. Their maiden meeting came in the Australian Open final of 2008, when Djokovic broke his major duck. No sooner had Tsonga delighted SW19 with his celebration dance after defeating Roger Federer in the quarter-finals three years ago, than the Serbian snuffed out his joy, winning their semi-final on route to the title. Tsonga has promised to dance again if he beats Djokovic on Monday. But he is 29-years-old, and even though cracks are appearing in the Big Four’s dominance, the chances for Tsonga to make that ultimate breakthrough are becoming slimmer. Almost: Lleyton Hewitt battled back from two sets down but fell to Jerzy Janowicz in the fifth . The Frenchman said he would draw on his victory over Federer here in 2011, which required a comeback from two sets down. ‘I will use this whole match to remember in which mind I was and try to do the same,’ he said. ‘Of course, for me the goal will be to make my dance at the end.’ Lleyton Hewitt looked like he might stage an overnight comeback from two sets down against 15th seed Jerzy Janowicz. The Aussie saved two match points in the third-set tiebreak but ran out of steam in the decider.  Janowicz will meet 23rd seed Tommy Robredo today. Elsewhere, 20th seed Kevin Anderson beat 16th seed Fabio Fognini in another five-setter, with the erratic Italian appearing to give up in the final set.","Grigor Dimitrov defeated Alexandr Dolgopolov in fives sets .

"A harpist has spent nearly a decade playing to gorillas at her local zoo to cheer them up. Terri Tacheny enjoyed taking her young daughters to Como Zoo in St. Paul, Minnesota, except for the Primate House, where she thought the gorillas, orangutans and monkeys seemed a little lethargic. So she decided to brighten their moods by playing her harp to them. Terri Tacheny, a harpist, has spent nearly a decade playing to gorillas at Como Zoo in St. Paul, Minnesota, to cheer them up .

'I don't speak gorilla, but there's a gorilla purr that occurs when I begin to play. And that's their happy sound,' Tacheny said. As the shimmering sounds of Tacheny's harp drift through the leafy zoo, a male gorilla stares through the fence at the musician, then chews contentedly on vegetation.

'I don't speak gorilla, but there's a gorilla purr that occurs when I begin to play. And that's their happy sound,' Tacheny said . Families stop to snap pictures. A therapeutic harpist, Tacheny plays for hospital patients to help them deal with pain and anxiety. She thought if the soothing sounds helped calm humans, it would work for the primates too. 'I would love to see every zoo have a harpist. I think it benefits the animals,' said Tacheny, a quick-to-smile woman. Tami Murphy, a zookeeper at Como, said Tacheny has played for all the animals at the zoo. Some animals appear ambivalent, Murphy said, but the harp music 'seems to be a really calming thing for the apes to listen to.' Tacheny says she's never gotten a negative review from her ape audience. 'I've never had anything thrown at me,' she said. Chimpanzees like to listen to music - but have very specific tastes, researchers revealed earlier this year. While preferring silence to music from the West, chimpanzees like to listen to the different rhythms of music from Africa and India, researchers found. The research is the first to discover primates have a preference for music, according to the American Psychological Association, which published the study. The researchers admit they made the discovery by mistake, said study coauthor Frans de Waal, PhD, of Emory University. 'Our objective was not to find a preference for different cultures' music,' she said. 'We used cultural music from Africa, India and Japan to pinpoint specific acoustic properties. 'Past research has focused only on Western music and has not addressed the very different acoustic features of non-Western music. While nonhuman primates have previously indicated a preference among music choices, they have consistently chosen silence over the types of music previously tested. Previous research has found that some nonhuman primates prefer slower tempos, but the current findings may be the first to show that they display a preference for particular rhythmic patterns, according to the study. 'Although Western music, such as pop, blues and classical, sound different to the casual listener, they all follow the same musical and acoustic patterns. 'Therefore, by testing only different Western music, previous research has essentially replicated itself,' the authors wrote. The study was published in APA's Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Learning and Cognition.

"You couldn't help but see that there was something a little different in Sydney's Hyde Park this morning. Workers in the city centre were met with the unusual spectacle of an 18 metre (60 foot high) bright pink condom which appeared over city landmark heritage-listed obelisk. The giant sheath is part of a new awareness campaign about HIV by ACON, a health promotion organization with a central focus on HIV/AIDS, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender health. The pink condom is being used a campaigning tool against HIV and was lowered onto Sydney's Hyde Park Obelisk on Thursday night . The 18m symbol is part of a campaign by ACON, a health promotion organization with a central focus on HIV/AIDS, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender health . Nicholas Parkhill from the AIDS Council of New South Wales (ACON) said: 'This installation is sure to create lots of interest as we've selected a very visible icon in a high traffic area.' Parkhill said while new drugs were able to help in the fight against HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, condoms were still crucial in stopping the spread of the disease, particularly among gay men. 'We need to constantly find new ways to promote this message, especially in the lead up to World AIDS Day on December 1,' he added. The giant condom is visible from all angles in Sydney's CBD . The condom has caused quite a stir with the Australian Christian Lobby calling it 'disappointing' But Wendy Francis from the Australian Christian Lobby said the stunt was disappointing and ""inappropriate for open spaces where children can see it"", she told Australian Associated Press.

"Brazil legend Romario claims Brazilian football is being ruined by ‘talentless moguls’ in an extraordinary outburst. The former Brazil forward, who won the World Cup with his country in 1994, believes the tournament has been shamed by their 7-1 semi-final defeat against Germany on Tuesday. Romario, who was writing on his Facebook page, is now an MP and has been campaigning for greater accountability for the massive expense to stage the World Cup in Brazil. VIDEO Scroll down to  watch Scolari say Brazil will continue to be one of the World's best . Humiliation: Romario slammed the 'talentless moguls' who run Brazilian football after 7-1 defeat to Germany .

Who's at fault? Brazil lost 7-1 in their own back yard, breaking a few unwanted records along the way . He said: ‘Yesterday was a very sad day for our football. Those with good memories will remember my words: “Off the field, we have already lost the World Cup”. ‘Sadly it was no different on the field. There is a crisis in our beloved sport.

"Cristiano Ronaldo might have achieved the impossible. He might have delivered the landslide of goals it needed to fill a void in goal difference as deep as the Grand Canyon and thereby send the USA  plunging from that famous precipice of theirs. If half the great man’s thunderous shots and leaping headers had crossed the line then Portugal would have done so too. Inexplicably, it was not to be.

Portugal (4-3-3): Beto 7, Pereira 6, Pepe 6.5, Alves 5.5, Veloso 5.5, Moutinho 6.5, William 6, Amorim 6, Nani 6, Eder 7, Ronaldo 9.5 . Coach: Paulo Bento 6.6 . Goals: Boye 30 og,Ronaldo 80. Booked: Joao Moutinho. Ghana (4-2-2-2): Dauda 6.5, Afful 6.5, Boye 5, Mensah 6, Asamoah 6, Rabiu 6, Badu 6, Atsu 7, A Ayew 6, Waris 7, Gyan 7.5 . Booked: Afful,Waris,Jordan Ayew. Goals: Gyan 57. Att: 67,540 . Coach: Akwasi Appiah 5 . Referee: Nawaf Shukralla (Bahrain) 6 . Yet the fates decreed he should be given only one goal. It was a trifle in return for the command performance he gave. It . was the winner, against a Ghana team which cast out its own demons to . put on a thrilling show of their own. But it was not the  miracle this . genius of a ball  conjurer deserved. Run . after run and shot after shot ended in seemingly impossible . frustration. When one last brilliant, surging effort was somehow denied . he just sat there, at first beating his fists on the turf in despair, . then gazing around him disbelief. If . it is some small consolation, Ronaldo will be forever remembered for . what he almost achieved on this sunlit afternoon, not for his failure to . match Lionel Messi and now Neymar in World Cup goalscoring. That . Ronaldo, 29, could play with such desire despite carrying into this . match his belief that Portugal were not good enough to challenge for the . game’s greatest prize is all the more remarkable. Kudos, also, to Ghana. They came into this match out of meltdown in their dressing room and made a splendid fight of it. It all came to a thrilling climax but there had been as much or more turmoil going on before it started. Tumble: Ronaldo goes down under the challenge of Ghana defender John Boye . Ronaldo . packing in readiness for going home as soon as the game was over. Ghana . beating him to it by sending two of their players packing before the . kick-off. The Africans . flying in three million bucks in readies to stop the rest of their team . packing up before they even found out they had not scraped through to . the last 16. Never . mind that both Portugal and Ghana still had a chance of making it to . the knockout phase at kick-off. An outside chance, maybe, but surely one . still worth fighting for no matter what was going on over in Recife. At . least Sulley Muntari thought so. The AC Milan midfielder was so upset . with the way things were going that he physically assaulted a Ghanaian . executive committee man during a team meeting. Kevin-Prince . Boateng, once of Tottenham and Portsmouth and now with Schalke, did not . go quite that far but he did make his feelings known as to why Ghana . were bottom of this group with a ‘vulgar verbal assault’ on manager . James Kwesi Appiah. The pair . were put on the first plane out of here.  But don’t feel sorry for . those two. Save your pity for the tens of thousands of Ghana fans who . had travelled in the hope of seeing Africa’s day at the World Cup . finally arrive. In control: Ronaldo holds off Asamoah Gyan (left) and Mohammed Rabiu of Ghana . Ronaldo, for . his part, had written off Portugal’s prospects, admitting: ‘We were . never going to win the World Cup with a team as average as this.’ How . close he came to proving himself wrong. Ronaldo . came close to opening the scoring in the fifth minute when no one else . in this skyscraper stadium sensed a whiff of a chance. From way out on . the right he floated a cross beyond and behind Fatua Dauda, who could . only turn and watch the ball rebound from his crossbar. Six . minutes later Ghana’s goalkeeper dived to his left to turn aside a . trademark Ronaldo free-kick. Seven minutes after that the new World . Footballer of the Year rose for a powerful header which Dauda palmed . away. So it was to go on … and on. Down and out: Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo . Ghana, . with their nation’s pride to save, were having their moments, too. By a . poignant irony, a Ghanaian defender scored for Portugal the goal for . which, after half an hour, Ronaldo was still urgently striving. Miguel . Veloso crossed on the run from the left and John Boye’s panicky swing . contrived to provide a finishing touch of which Ronaldo would have been . proud. The ball looped upwards off his knee at an implausible angle to . ricochet gently into the net off both bar and post. On . the stroke of half-time we were almost bore witness to history. The . same Ghanaian defender took a similar wild swing, only this time the . ball sheered just over the bar. Maybe . it would be safer to leave this John Boye in Walton’s Mountain. No . sooner had Thomas Muller put Germany ahead in Recife than the glimmer of . hope that Portugal might overturn the USA’s goal difference advantage . evaporated with a Ghana equaliser. Clinical: Ghana's Asamoah Gyan, left, scores the equaliser against Portugal . Clinical: Ghana's Asamoah Gyan, left, scores the equaliser against Portugal . Asamoah Gyan rose to meet Kwadwo Asamoah’s cross with an unstoppable header. Now . it was Ghana who had closed within striking distance of the Americans. Their athletic pace kept carrying them deep into the Portuguese penalty . area but the finishing touch eluded them. That dream finally died at the feet of Ronaldo — who else? After slamming his shot low into the corner from Dauda’s weak palming down of the ball, Ronaldo spurned celebration. He just turned away, knowing that his race was run.

"He was there to accept an honorary doctorate but all everyone was wondering was if former Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe was dating singer Ricky Martin. Adding 'doctor' to his Order of Australia and the five Olympic Gold medals he won during his swimming career, Thorpe accepted an honorary doctorate from Sydney's Macquarie University on Wednesday. Thorpe received a Medal of the Order of Australia in 2001 for his service to sport after he came away from the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games as a gold medalist. The awarding of the honorary doctorate comes just two months after he came out as gay in a television interview with former British chat show king Michael Parkinson. Scroll down for video . Ian Thorpe (left) received a honorary doctorate from Macquarie University in Sydney's north and laughs off rumours he and Ricky Martin (right) were dating . The 31-year-old has won five Olympic gold medals - more than any other Australian. Here he is celebrating his win in the 200m freestyle at the Athens Olympics . Thorpe told Daily Mail Australia he had been doing well since his admission, which finally laid to rest years of speculation about his sexuality. 'Things have been good, I'm really happy and glad to be home,' he said. Since the interview, Thorpe has also been linked to The Voice Australia judge Ricky Martin who has been a pillar of support for the sports star. But on Wednesday he denied the romance. 'I've said it before, they're not true,' Thorpe - who has won five Olympic gold medals - told Daily Mail Australia with a laugh. The former Olympian spoke in front of a 600-strong crowd and imparted his wisdom on graduates . He spokes to the crowd for about 10 minutes and battled what appeared to be a cold as he delivered his speech . The Australian swimming superstar was flanked by academic personnel as he made his way to the event . Speculation the pair were a couple was sparked after the Latino star sent a tweet of support to the 31-year-old sporting champion when the latter came out. 'Congrats @Ian Thorpe! Brave man! Happy for you! Million appreciate what you’ve done! Proud of you!' Ricky Martin wrote at the time. As a man used to the spotlight, Thorpe seemed nervous as he accepted the honorary doctorate from his alma mater and imparted some wisdom on business graduates at Macquarie University. The always humble Olympian - who was wearing a black velvet cap with two gold tassels and a satin white-and-red cloak - apologised for not being actor Cate Blanchett who was recently presented with the same honour. 'I know some of you may be tremendously disappointed. Cate Blanchett gave one of these addresses just a week ago and you're stuck with me,' Thorpe joked. At first, the Thorpedo was nervous but soon he eased into his speech, and posed for photos for the media afterwards . Thorpe studied a Bachelor of Arts at the university and also trained in its swimming pool . The 31-year-old came out during an interview with former British chat show king Michael Parkinson . His coming out ended years of speculation about his sexuality but sparked rumours he was dating singer Ricky Martin . Thorpe also spoke frankly about how he was not someone who was good with compliments. 'I struggle with being complimented or commended. I find it easier to be criticised,' Thorpe told the 600-strong crowd during the graduation ceremony. 'To excel as a champion does not sit comfortable with most. To be on the top, there really is only one other way and it's not down. 'They also say when you reach number one, you should work like number two. 'But I would not do this because I do not see the point of ever expecting second best, nor should you.' Thorpe studied a Bachelor of Arts at Macquarie University and trained in its swimming pool for the Olympics. He is known affectionately by the public as the Thorpedo because of his swimming prowess .

"Chelsea are on the brink of signing striker Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid after they met the buyout clause to buy the Spanish forward. The West London club have acted quickly to secure Jose Mourinho’s principal summer target and Chelsea have announced that a deal has been agreed with the Spanish club. It is understood that the player’s release clause at Atletico is in the region of £32million. A statement read: ‘Chelsea Football Club can confirm an agreement has been reached with Atletico Madrid for the transfer of Diego Costa, with Chelsea meeting the buy-out clause for the Spanish international.’ Rubber-stamped: Chelsea have agreed a £32m move for the former Atletico Madrid striker . Disappointment: Costa was part of the Spain squad that bombed out of the World Cup in the group stages . VIDEO Chelsea reach Costa agreement . It is understood that personal terms have been agreed with the 25-year-old and the move has been in the pipeline for several weeks. Costa, who was part of the Spanish squad that failed so miserably at the World Cup in Brazil, scored 35 goals as Atletico enjoyed a magnificent season, with Diego Simeone’s side winning La Liga and reaching the Champions League final, only to be defeated by city rivals Real Madrid. Costa will become the club’s second signing of the summer transfer window after Mourinho added fellow Spanish international Cesc Fabregas to his squad in a £30m move from Barcelona in June. Mourinho has been determined to add to his striking options after he felt that the club’s chances of success were last season hampered by the inconsistent form of Fernando Torres, Demba Ba and Samuel Eto’o. All change: Atletico coach Diego Simeone has wished Costa all the best with his departure imminent . The Chelsea manager attempted to sign Wayne Rooney from Manchester United last summer but the striker was eventually persuaded to remain at Old Trafford before signing a new five-year contract at the turn of the year. Atletico are now understood to be targeting Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo to replace the outgoing Costa. The Spanish club believe that Manuel Pellegrini may be prepared to allow Negredo to leave after his form tailed off in alarming fashion in the second half of last season. The former Sevilla striker scored 23 goals by January for City but then failed to hit the net at any point in the final months of the campaign. Mourinho, meanwhile, will now focus his attention on securing a left-back to replace Ashley Cole, whose contract was not extended at the end of the season. He may return to Atletico for Filipe Luis but Chelsea are hoping to pay a little less than the Spanish side’s £20m asking price.","Diego Costa was Jose Mourinho's No 1 target .

"The man next door had run out of fireworks by the time Germany scored their seventh goal. Berliners have a habit of setting one off every time their team scores at a World Cup, but there wasn’t a shop in the city well stocked enough to provide for the Game of the Century. That is how the 7-1 victory over Brazil on Tuesday night is being referred to. 'Game of the Century' was a phrase previously reserved for West Germany’s semi-final defeat to Italy in 1970, which many consider to be the best football match ever. The 21st century, though, needed a game of its own. On Tuesday night it got one. Heroes: Germany smashed Brazil 7-1 in their World Cup semi-final clash in Belo Horizonte . Too good: Germany romped past Brazil with a stunning display to produce a shocking result . Leader: German manager Joachim Low was hailed as a national hero after his team's 7-1 victory . Germany were irresistible. Before this game, they had been criticised for having abandoned the joyful football they played at the last World Cup. Within one 18-minute period in the first half, they answered their critics, silenced them, and had them dancing on their sofas. Joachim Low, a man who has been attacked from every angle during this tournament, is suddenly a national hero once more. Toni Kroos was once bemoaned for his apparent laziness. Mesut Ozil likewise. But both are beyond criticism today, architects of a truly historic victory in Belo Horizonte. The Sueddeutsche Zeitung even referred to Kroos as ‘like Xavi and Iniesta as one’. VIDEO Delight in Munich for Germany fans . Loud and proud: Germany fans at the Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte celebrate their team's victory . How many? One German fan at a public viewing in Berlin spells out the scoreline . Abroad: German fans in Palma de Mallorca watch their team annihilate Brazil . Lining up: Germany now expects to lift the World Cup at the Maracana on Sunday after this victory . But it was not the performances of . individual players for which this game will be remembered. It was the . blistering collective display. It was the evening in which a team, which . has disappointed so often in semi-finals, finally came into their own. It was for the team that the German media reserved their praise. Bild’s headline simply said ‘Thank you’, and the paper went on to insist that ‘no other team has earned the World Cup title more than Germany in this tournament’. The excitement ahead of the final is already at boiling point; the atmosphere in Germany has changed overnight. On Tuesday afternoon, there was cautious optimism that Germany might scrape their way to the finish line. On Wednesday morning, the nation expects nothing less. Wir kommen ins Finale: The front page of Bild . Ramba Samba: The Hamburger Morgen Post . Danke: The Bergische Morgenpost says thank you . The players themselves weren’t getting . carried away. Thomas Muller mischievously reminded reporters after the . game that ‘after games like the beloved Algeria match, we get . criticised, now you praise us into heaven’. Coach Low was also quick to nail some . feet to the ground, insisting that ‘a bit of humility is good for us . too. We don’t want to be overhyped’. Not that the reaction is all based on clichéd German arrogance. Many newspapers were even apologetic to the hosts. Both the Tagesspiegel and the B.Z had the headline ‘Sorry’, with the latter describing Germany as ‘the worst guests in history’. Largely, though, this is a day of celebration for German football. The Berliner Morgenpost has called it ‘The Miracle of Belo Horizonte’, and many fans are as stunned as they are delighted. They hadn’t expected this from Low and his team. From the word go, almost the entire country had insisted that this team was chronically ill. Tactical, psychological and physical symptoms were identified at every opportunity. The national team was supposedly a sick man. On Tuesday night, the patient got out of its bed, threw on its clothes, and ran a marathon. It proved it was not sick at all, and it gave Germany one of the greatest nights of its footballing history. The country is in dreamland.

"Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson has revealed how Argentina allegedly told Chilean officials to stop the crew entering the country as they tried to flee from an angry mob upset over their car’s H982FKL number plate. The 54-year-old BBC presenter claims the South American country tried to stop their quick getaway so that Clarkson – along with the show’s fellow stars Richard Hammond and James May – could be arrested. However, Argentina’s plan was thwarted when the Chilean officials refused to succumb to the request – instead letting the crew into the country where they were able to safely fly back to the United Kingdom. Scroll down for videos . The Top Gear team (pictured during their trip to Argentina) including Richard Hammond (far left), Jeremy Clarkson (second left) and James May (far right) were forced to flee the country after being hounded by a mob . Argentine officials and newspapers took offence to Clarkson's number plate, which they said was a 'provocation' and a 'very big offence'. They claimed it was a reference to the the 1982 Falklands conflict . Clarkson said the number plate was a coincidence and was not meant as a reference to the Falklands War . A Lotus car which was used by Top Gear presenter James May is pictured with smashed windows after being pelted with stones by angry Falklands War veterans as the crew tried to make their way through the country . The drama unfolded when the Top Gear convoy was attacked with rocks, sticks and pickaxe handles as it made its way through the country during filming for a special edition of the BBC motoring show. Angry locals hounded the crew after the Porsche Clarkson was driving arrived into the country with the H982 FKL plates – which locals have claimed referred to the 1982 Falklands conflict. Clarkson said he was forced to hide under a hotel room bed with his co-stars as an armed mob rampaged after them and shouted: ‘This is a mafia state, best you do as you're told'. They were eventually forced to flee Argentina under police escort – three days earlier than planned - as the furious thugs tried to 'kill' them. They faced a gruelling six-hour journey to the Chilean border in a collection of hired 4x4s, trucks and the three 'star' cars that the crew had planned to use in the ‘car football match’ for the show. They eventually made it to a remote border post where there was not even a road, but a river, and boarded a tractor to cross the water into the neighbouring country. The presenters' cars were left by the side of the road in Argentina before they fled across the border to Chile . Clarkson's damaged Porsche bearing the H982 FKL plate, which locals took to be reference to the 1982 conflict . The Top Gear crew came under attack from a group of angry Falklands War veterans . The crowd was incensed by the number plate - H982 FKL - on the Porsche driven by Jeremy Clarkson . The attack took place in Ushuaia, on the southern tip of Argentina. The crew later fled over the border to Chile . However, the presenter said it was at this point on Friday night that they faced difficulty crossing into Chile when the Argentinians ordered that they were stopped. He told The Sun: ‘After they [the crew] crossed a river into Chile, they spoke to the local official who said his opposite number in Argentina called him and told him to chuck our guys out, back into Argentina. ‘Their plan was to then arrest the crew for entering the country illegally. ‘Luckily for us, we’re really popular in Chile and they love the British so the official refused. In fact his direct quote was, “I told them, f***k you!”.’ Clarkson described him as a ‘real hero’ and also praised the police officers who escorted the film crew safely into Chile. Jeremy Clarkson (pictured after landing at Heathrow) said the number was a complete coincidence . Clarkson took to Twitter upon returning to the UK to clarify that no offence was intended to be caused . However, he also accused the Argentinians of taking advantage of their visit for 'political capital' and said the violent protest was 'state-organised'. ‘The more I think about this, the more I’m convinced we were set up by the local government,’ he added. The controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the BBC received it for filming, a spokesman for the show said. The H at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991. FKL, the last three letters, represent where the vehicle was first registered. In this case it was Maidstone in Kent. The numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the DVLA. Porsche confirmed today the car was not bought from them by producers at Top Gear, but from a private owner. It is possible to transfer registration plates to a new vehicle for £80. Plates beginning in NIQ or Q - Northern Ireland registered vehicles - cannot be transferred. Motorists cannot transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger. His comments come as it emerged that he may have broken driving laws by switching number plates on the grey 1991 Porsche. Photographs show how the crew swapped the number plate from the controversial H982 FKL to H1 VAE after the abuse started. However, the replacement plate is allegedly already licensed to another vehicle – a white 206 Porsche. It means Clarkson could have breached driving regulations as the DVLA said it is an offence to drive a car ‘in this country or abroad’ under a plate other than the one assigned to the vehicle. The Independent reported that the BBC planned to ask the Top Gear crew about the registration plate used but ‘not in an investigative way’. Earlier, Clarkson took to Twitter to confirm that he, along with the rest of the Top Gear team, had not meant to cause offence with H982 FKL plate. He wrote: 'The number plate WAS a coincidence when it was pointed out to us, we changed it. 'And these war veterans we upset. Mostly they were in their 20s. Do the maths. 'They threw us out for the political capital. Thousands chased crew to border. Someone could have been killed. 'This was not a jolly jape that went awry. For once, we did nothing wrong. 'We had planned a good ending for the show. But thanks to the government's foolishness, it's now even better.' Clarkson was in South America filming for the next series of Top Gear with Richard Hammond and James May . April 2007 - Referring to a car made in Malaysia, he said it was built by 'jungle people who wear leaves as shoes'. October 2009 - Claimed TV producers were obsessed with having 'black Muslim lesbians' on screen. January 2012 - He compared synchronised swimming to the deaths of 23 Chinese cockle pickers in Morecambe Bay in 2004. January 2012 - Clarkson mocked the clothing, trains and food in India, as he ridiculed the country's sanitation by driving a Jaguar fitted with a toilet through slums. The Indian High Commission in London formally complained to the BBC about the comments. March 2013 - The presenter joked that a bridge with an Asian walking across it had a 'slope on it'. The BBC later apologised but said it was not aware of the racist term at the time. In July, Ofcom ruled Clarkson had deliberately used racist language, but the BBC did not take action against him. April 2014 - He took to Twitter to introduce his new dog - a black terrier he named Didier Dogba after the Ivory Coast and Chelsea footballer, Didier Drogba. May 2014 - Clarkson was caught in a clip reciting the rhyme: 'Eeny, meeny, miny, moe' before mumbling what sounded like 'catch a n***** by his toe'. Clarkson initially denied the incident but then backed down and said he was 'mortified' and 'horrified when he realised it 'did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure'.","Jeremy Clarkson and Top Gear crew hounded out of Argentina by a mob .

"House Speaker John Boehner on Thursday starkly warned President Barack Obama that if he meddles in the immigration system and issues an executive order granting millions of illegals amnesty, he'll sorely regret it. 'When you play with matches, you take the risk of burning yourself,' Boehner said today at a Washington, D.C. press conference. 'And he's going to burn himself if he continues to go down this path.' The GOP leader was responding to Obama's commitment on Wednesday 'to take whatever lawful actions' he can to make changes to the deportation process - with or without the permission of Congress - before the end of the year. Scroll down for video . No more Mr. Nice Guy: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio told reporters today during a Capitol Hill  press conference that Obama would live to regret acting alone on immigration reform . 'I've consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill,' Obama said during a press conference on Wednesday. 'I think it's fair to say that I've shown a lot of patience and tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible and will keep doing so.' But in the absence of congressional action, Obama again promised to make his own reforms. The president has not said what moves he's considering, but White House officials have indicated that anywhere between one and 11 million illegal immigrants could be allowed to stay in the U.S. as a direct result. Challenging Boehner, Obama said on Wednesday, 'You send me a bill that I can sign and those executive actions go away. 'What we can't do is just keep on waiting,' he argued. 'There's a cost for waiting.' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is slated to become Majority Leader of the Senate in January, said Wednesday that Obama was taking the wrong approach to altering the nation's broken immigration system. 'I think the president choosing to do a lot of things unilaterally on immigration would be a big mistake,' McConnell told reporters during a press conference out of Kentucky, where he had just been reelected to his Senate seat the night before. 'It's an issue that most of my members want to address legislatively and it's like waving a red flag in front of a bull to say, ""If you guys don't do what I want, I'm going to do it on my own."" 'I hope he won't do that because I do think it poisons the well for the opportunity to address a very important domestic issue,' McConnell said. Boehner reiterated McConnell's observation on Thursday, saying if Obama acts on his own will to 'poison the well' for broader reforms to the immigration process 'and there will be no chance for immigration reform moving in this Congress. 'The American people made it clear Election Day, they want to get things done, and they don't want the president acting on a unilateral basis,' Boehner said. The House Speaker, who has long said he's in favor of reforming the immigration system in a step-by-step fashion rather than the president's preferred comprehensive method, said he was doing his best to come up with a package that all parties involved could agree to. 'I could regale you with all of my challenges of trying to get members on both sides of the aisle to deal with this. They were numerous. But hope springs eternal,' he said. Not bluffing: President Barack Obama recommitted on Wednesday to saving millions of illegal immigrants from deportation by issuing an executive order giving them work permits . The Republican legislator signaled on Thursday that the post-election Kumbaya between the White House and Republicans, at least as far as he is concerned, is already over, just two days after the midterm election that gave his party a historic number of seats in Congress. 'My job is not to get along with the president, just to get along with him, although we actually have a nice relationship,' Boehner told reproters today. 'My job is to listen to my members and listen to the American people and make their priorities our priorities.' At today's presser and in an op-ed with McConnell that appeared in today's Wall Street Journal Boehner made it clear that chief among his concerns is getting rid of the health care reform law. 'The American people have made it clear they are not for ObamaCare,' Boehner said today. 'Ask all those Democrats who lost their elections Tuesday. A lot of them voted for ObamaCare.' Realistically, Republicans have no shot in Hades of getting the president to sign off on a repeal of Obamacare. However, Boehner waved off the critical point as irrelevant today. 'Just because we might not be able to get everything we want doesn't mean we shouldn't try to get what we can,' Boehner contended. 'There are bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate to take some of these issues out of ObamaCare. We need to put them on the president's desk and let him choose,' the Ohio representative said. As Boehner was pledging on Capitol Hill to stand his ground on Obamacare and other issues key to the GOP's agenda, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was assuring reporters at his daily briefing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that the president is dedicated to finding 'common ground' with Republicans in Congress. The president looks forward to meeting with Boehner and other congressional leaders for lunch tomorrow at the White House, Earnest said, suggesting that a new era of bipartisanship could be on the way in Washington. Boehner seemed suspicious on Thursday at his own briefing, across town, that the Democratic president actually intends to compromise with Republicans. 'Finding common ground is going to be hard work, but it will be even harder if the president isn’t willing to work with us,' Boehner said.","Obama recommitted on Wednesday 'to take whatever lawful actions' he can to make changes to the deportation process through executive order .
Boehner pushed back on Obama on Thursday; 'My job is not to get along with the president, just to get along with him,' he told reporters .

"Tottenham are determined to overcome a transfer wrangle with Swansea City in their attempts to land left-back Ben Davies. New Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino wants the Wales international to be his first-choice left-back next season. Spurs and Swansea have been locked in talks over a proposed move for Davies - who is valued at £12million - to White Hart Lane. Wanted: Ben Davies will cost Tottenham Hotspur £10million if he is to leave Swansea City . Tottenham thought they had made a breakthrough in discussions last Friday, after tabling an offer for the full-back that they believed was enough to snare Davies. Sportsmail understands the 21-year-old was even due to arrive at the club's Enfield training ground on Monday for talks. However, sources close to the deal claim Swans chairman Huw Jenkins pulled the plug on the deal over the weekend, causing a delay in the move. New man: Mauricio Pochettino remains interested in Davies to make the youngster his first-choice left-back . Pochettino still remains highly interested in signing Davies ahead of next season, and Tottenham are trying to revive the deal. However, it remains to be seen whether an agreement can be reached following the wrangle. Davies is also attracting interest from Atletico Madrid.","Mauricio Pochettino wants Welsh international as his first-choice left-back .

"Roy Keane has told England’s players they under-performed at the World Cup and should have at least got out of the group. The new Aston Villa assistant manager predicted Roy Hodgson’s squad would struggle in Brazil before the tournament began but even he admits: ‘I didn’t think they’d struggle that much, to be fair.’ Yet Keane defended Wayne Rooney and dismissed claims by Paul Scholes, his former midfield partner at Manchester United, that the 28-year-old striker might be past his peak. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney: We prepared as well as we could for World Cup . New: Roy Keane joined Aston Villa as assistant manager and reignited interest in Richardson . Still got it? Keane believes Wayne Rooney is not past his peak despite criticism from Paul Scholes . Early exit: Keane was surprised by England's poor World Cup campaign, despite predicting Roy Hodgson's side would struggle in the heat of Brazil . ‘If you think Wayne Rooney’s gone, then you are sadly mistaken,’ Keane said. Rooney drew criticism from some quarters for his performance in the less familiar left-wing position against Italy, despite setting up Daniel Sturridge’s goal. Keane is still supportive of Rooney, who then scored an equaliser against Uruguay, but he still believes the striker could have made a bigger impression . ‘I thought he did okay,’ said Keane. ‘There was a lot rolled into his position. England scored two and he got one of them. I’m sure Wayne, like lots of the players, will feel he could have done better. Top players are always quick to look at themselves, they are quite self-critical.’ It was Keane’s analysis of England as a whole that drew deeper criticism. In his final appearance as an ITV pundit, at the Champions League final, Keane prompted nervous laughter from England captain Steven Gerrard alongside him by stating: ‘I do think they’ll struggle.’ Speaking now, Keane says: ‘That’s not football knowledge. That’s just common sense.’ More to come? Despite scoring against Uruguay, Rooney could've contributed more according to Keane . Killer blow: Uruguay's Luis Suarez scored the goals which effectively ended the Three Lion's hopes in Brazil . Glum: Rooney looks dejected after England's second group stage defeat of the tournament to Uruguay . But watching Hodgson’s team finish bottom of Group D, with defeats to Italy and Uruguay and a goalless draw with Costa Rica, was a shock. Keane, 42, has first-hand experience of Costa Rica in his role as Republic of Ireland assistant under Martin O’Neill because the sides drew 1-1 in a friendly last month. ‘If you had said they were going to top that group I’d have said you were mad,’ said Keane. ‘But they’ve obviously done well. They’ve adapted to the conditions. Whatever’s happened with England, the players didn’t perform. ‘In most championships in recent years they’ve just not peaked at the right time. You can argue all day about winter breaks and the rest of it but they should’ve done better. They should’ve got out of the group.’ Expectations were low after a mediocre Euro 2012 and Football Association chairman Greg Dyke symbolised the feeling with a cut-throat gesture when the World Cup draw was made. Star man: Fulham flop Bryan Ruiz helped Costa Rica top Group D and reach the quarter-finals against Holland . Surprise package: Costa Rica were expected to struggle but have already reached the last eight in Brazil . Keane believes the squad was short of experienced winners. Of the starting line-up against Italy, Phil Jagielka, Raheem Sterling and Leighton Baines are yet to win major silverware, with subs Adam Lallana and Ross Barkley in the same position. ‘I still look at their group and maybe a lot of them lack that vital experience, whether it be Champions League or big-game experience,’ said Keane. ‘People are ranting and raving about some of their bigger players but they still have a lot to do. It’s not their fault but some of the younger players are yet to win a trophy. Yet people expect them to go to the World Cup and get to the quarters or semis.’ Keane aired his views while being unveiled as Paul Lambert’s assistant at Villa and the outspoken Irishman used the occasion to reveal that he thinks it would have been impossible to continue giving TV criticism while working in football. His views offer perspective on Gary Neville’s decision to work as an analyst for Sky Sports while coaching with England. Lots to learn: Keane believes the inexperience of players like Raheem Sterling had a part to play in England's downfall . Next level: Leighton Baines (right) is yet to win a major trophy or play in the Champions League . Return? Keane has not ruled out working as a pundit for ITV again after pulling out of his World Cup duties . ‘I really enjoyed ITV. It kept me busy, got to some good matches,’ said Keane. ‘I just felt the time had come. I’m not saying I wouldn’t get back into it. Getting back with the Irish team, I felt awkward sometimes doing one or two matches where there were Irish players. There was maybe a little bit of conflict. That doesn’t help. ‘I felt it could have been awkward for one or two other players I was maybe working with or commentating on and I didn’t want that issue. But good luck to Gary, we’re all different. I didn’t want to have any compromise regarding my role in football with punditry. The half-measure wasn’t working for me.’ And will he be the next Villa boss? There were certainly no half-measures on that subject. ‘No, absolutely not,’ he said.","Roy Keane believes Wayne Rooney has plenty more to give for Manchester United and England .

"In the end, Cesare Prandelli did the decent thing. Italy have won four World Cups and his countrymen demanded a fifth.

At the centre of the farce is manager Roy Hodgson, still in his job despite his failure and last night bizarrely claiming that England hadn’t been outplayed or outclassed. He said: ‘All I can say is we haven’t been that fortunate here... we haven’t got the results. If you’re Iran, and you play with eight or nine behind the ball and make incredible stops and draw 0-0, you’ve had a great game. That’ll never be the case with England. The pressure for teams like England is greater.’ After this debacle, expectations have never been lower. Watching .

"An 11-year-old boy with muscular dystrophy committed suicide by suffocating himself months after being bullied and robbed of an iPhone. Mitchell Wilson, of Pickering in Ontario, Canada, was out walking when his face and teeth were smashed into the pavement by a boy from his school. A 12-year-old was arrested and removed from the school, but Mitchell’s father said his disabled boy was ‘never the same’ after the attack. Acquitted: A teen accused of beating up and stealing from 11-year-old Mitchell Wilson (pictured) leading to his suicide in 2011, was acquitted from his charges today . Changed: Mitchell's father said his son 'lost that spark you see in a kid's eye' after the robbery . Mitchell was attacked last November for the Apple iPhone he had borrowed from his father Craig Wilson, reported the Huffington Post. He was scared of bullies who picked on him because of his disability and the attack made him even more stressed and anxious, Mr Wilson said. 'Subsequent to the beating that he took, he just lost that spark you see in a kid's eye,' Mr Wilson told CTV Canada AM. 'He had huge anxiety attacks about going outside and going for his walks and going to school by himself.' Evidence: Written and oral testimony by Mitchell prior to his suicide was found not reliable enough by the court though the boy's father Craig Wilson says he is keeping his son's side of the story as the truth . Disappointment: Family of Mitchell expressed disappointment after the verdict today while his grandmother Pam Wilson earlier said they 'don't want to be a lynch squad' but hope the alleged attacker is helped for a better life . Conclusion: Concluding the trial, the court's judge said she hopes one day the boy's attackers will one day come forward and take responsibility for their crime . Mitchell lost his mother three years ago to skin cancer - and he was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy last year, reported the National Post. Doctors had told Mitchell his muscular dystrophy could be helped by walking outside, but he was scared of doing this after the attack. Phoebe Prince - January 2010The 15-year-old Irish immigrant was racially taunted for three months by classmates in Massachusetts after she dated a popular boy. She was found by her sister hanging in the stairwell of her home. Tyler Clementi - September 2010The Rutgers University freshman's roommate used secret cameras to record the 18-year-old kissing another man and stream it over the internet. He jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge. Jamey Rodemeyer - September 2011The gay 14-year-old thanked Lady Gaga in a YouTube video in which he talked about suffering incessant homophobic bullying. He was found dead outside his Buffalo home. Mitchell committed suicide and was found dead in his bedroom earlier this month on the day he was due to start a new school year. It was also one day after he received a . subpoena to testify against his alleged attacker, who cannot be . identified for legal reasons. Mr Wilson said his son was embarrassed and apologised to him because he could not stop the attacker beating him up. The 12-year-old was due to appear in court on Wednesday, but prosecutors said it was too soon after the suicide. Now there appears to be nobody to testify at the trial and the charge of assault could be dropped. A new trial date has been set for November 21. Mitchell's grandmother Pam Wilson said his family 'don't want to be a lynch squad' and are only trying to help the attacker have a better life. The 11-year-old's death is the latest in a string of suicides which came after accusations of bullying. Just last week gay 14-year-old Jamey Rodemeyer killed himself after being subjected to vile treatment over his homosexuality. Ann Haas, senior project specialist at . the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, cautioned against a . phenomenon known as contagion, in which suicides among people in similar . circumstances can increase after a very public death. 'Suicide is not a heroic act or something to be emulated or admired,' she said. 'If we portray it as something that is admirable and very sympathetic, vulnerable youth may hear that as, ""Look at the attention this case is getting and everyone is feeling sorry and praising this individual,"" and it can form a narrative that can be compelling.'","Mitchell Wilson, who had muscular dystrophy, became scared to go out .

"Sir Bobby Charlton’s former agent Ray Whelan has been bailed from Brazilian prison following his arrest for allegedly helping illegal World Cup ticket sales. Whelan, a director of MATCH Services — a subsidiary company of FIFA’s ticket and hospitality partners Byrom — spent a night in the Rio cells after been seized in his room at the Copacabana Hotel. Whelan, 64, is accused of facilitating touting at the tournament by giving access to tickets which were re-sold at vastly inflated prices, which is illegal in Brazil.

Police confiscated 82 tickets for the semi-finals and final, along with Whelan’s computer, mobile phone and other documents. Yet he will continue to work on World Cup business having being released after handing over his passport. Whelan had been due to be transferred to the notorious Bangu prison but his lawyers secured a last-minute bail order at a cost of $5,000. Brazil police’s Operation Jules Rimet team, investigating ticket abuse, claim Whelan was heard in tapped phone calls negotiating ticket prices with Algerian national Lamine Fofana — suspected ringleader of serial ticket touting at World Cups. After Whelan’s release, a spokesman said: ‘MATCH have complete faith that the facts will establish that he has not violated any laws. ‘MATCH will continue to fully support all police investigations, which we firmly believe will fully exonerate Ray. In the meantime he will continue to work on our operational areas of responsibility.’ FIFA have worked closely with MATCH’s parent company Byrom since 1986. They have rights until 2023 for World Cup travel, tickets, hospitality, IT and accommodation from FIFA. Byrom insisted last night that Whelan was involved in MATCH’s accommodation arm, not tickets or hospitality. It is possible he was helping kick-start a late sale of hospitality packages. MATCH paid a guarantee of around £150million to FIFA for the rights to sell corporate hospitality at the 2010 and 2014 tournaments. Scene: The arrest took place at the Copacabana Palace, official accommodation for FIFA executives . Enforcer: A civil police officer speaks on his phone outside the hotel following the arrest . From more than three million tickets for the tournament, 445,500 were allocated to MATCH Hospitality with unused tickets returned to FIFA to be made available to the public. But police estimated last week that touts were making around £300,000 per game by re-selling tickets on the black market. MATCH said Fofana’s company Atlanta Sportif Management and three other companies — two of them MATCH Hospitality agents — had their remaining World Cup tickets blocked after some of their allocation ended up with touts. Marcos Kac, the prosecutor in charge of the case, told Sao Paulo newspaper Estadao that the decision to release Whelan was ‘absurd’ and added: ‘We are all very upset.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ray Whelan arrested in Rio de Janeiro following an investigation into ticket touting at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil .

"Tourist David Willis, of Dallas, Texas, told followers that he had been locked inside the Waterstones store in Trafalgar Square for at least two hours . An American tourist who was locked into a London bookshop by mistake last night today declared 'it feels good to be free'. David Willis, of Dallas, Texas, had been browsing in Waterstones on Trafalgar Square last night when he discovered the shop had been closed and he had been locked in. He then spent two hours inside the darkened store, desperately calling for help, before he was eventually rescued after he used Twitter to alert the world to his predicament. This morning Mr Willis told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I'm very tired, I did not sleep much last night but it feels good to be free.' He said he nipped in to the bookshop just before 9pm, not realising it was about to close, and walked past employees as he went upstairs to sit down and use the internet. Around 15 minutes later he got up to leave, but when he walked downstairs he discovered it was 'completely dark and the door is locked'. He added: 'Right when I came downstairs I saw I had been locked in and I went to the door, tried to open it, the alarm went off. 'The alarm sounded in Trafalgar Square for probably 20 or 25 minutes. 'The phone rang after about ten minutes or so. It was a security guard and I talked to him and I thought, you know, I'll be out of here in a few minutes. And a little more and a little more time went by. 'I finally said I'm going to talk to the police, I talked to them, and I thought I would get out from the police very soon. 'Then I just kept waiting and waiting, so eventually I went to social media.' He posted a picture of himself behind shutters inside the darkened store with the message: 'This is me locked inside a Waterstones bookstore in London. 'I was upstairs for 15 minutes and came down to all the lights out and door locked. Been here over an hour now. Supposedly someone is on their way.' In a later post which was retweeted by more than 7,000 people, he wrote: 'Hi Waterstones, I've been locked inside of your Trafalgar Square bookstore for two hours now. Please let me out.' When he was finally released, he wrote: 'I'm free.' Scroll down for video . Locked in: American tourist David Willis said on Twitter that he was upstairs at the Waterstones branch in London's Trafalgar Square for 15 minutes before coming down to find all the lights out and the doors locked . Trapped inside: He pleaded with Waterstones to 'please let me out' of the store in Trafalgar Square (above) Cry for help: Despite speaking to a security guard and calling police, it was a tweet that got Mr Wills freed . Twitter users were quick to offer Mr Willis assistance - with some telling him to call police, a few offering him food, and others giving book recommendations to help him pass the time. Before he had been saved, journalist Gaby Hinsliff said: 'Need my bed but can barely sleep till I know the Waterstones One is free. Poor @DWill_. Hope they give him a book token to make up for it.' Publisher Matt McAdam added: 'What would you do if you were locked in one of the world's great bookstores overnight? @DWill_ is finding out! @Waterstones.' And web developer Tim Archer said: '@DWill_ @Waterstones tell them you'll be randomly moving the books until you are released, that should speed them up a bit.' Paper prison: A still from a video taken by Mr Willis shows a staircase at the locked bookshop last night . Joke wearing thin: The American tourist used Twitter and Instagram to convey his plight to the outside world . A Scotland Yard spokesman said police were called at around 9.35pm 'by a man claiming to be locked inside a shop'. He added: 'Officers attended and following the arrival of a key holder the man left the building shortly after 11pm.' The Waterstones website says the Trafalgar Square store closes at 9pm. The book retailer posted a message on its Twitter feed saying: 'We're pleased to announce that [Mr Willis] is a free man once more. Thanks for your concern and tweets.' This morning Waterstones posted a blog on its website entitled 'What to read when you've two hours on your hands...and you are locked in a bookshop'. Last month homeless man Raj Patel, 32, was locked inside the Tate Britain art gallery in Pimlico, London, after falling asleep in the loo. Freedom: At 00.24am today, Mr Willis, of Dallas, Texas, posted to his relieved followers on Twitter: 'I'm free' Despite the alarm sounding and despite calls to the police and security guard, Mr Willis paced for two hours . He's out: At 00.15am this morning, a tweet was posted on the company's account, saying: 'We're pleased to announce that @DWill_ [David Willis] is a free man once more. Thanks for your concern and tweets!' He said it was 'eerie' inside the closed gallery. He spent around ten minutes wandering around the Tate before a security guard let him out. Help had eventually come from the Metropolitan Police, who rescued him at about 11.20pm last night. A force spokesman told the Daily Mail: 'We were contacted to say that a man was trapped inside the branch of Waterstones in Trafalgar Square. He was released between 11.05pm and 11.20pm.' Today, Mr Willis' plight was the subject of jokes on social media, with many other branches of the shop tweeting promising their customers they wouldn't lock them in and others suggesting what the Texan might have read. Escape from @Waterstones: No sooner had Twitter discovered Mr Willis was free than the jokes started . Envious of the publicity? Foyles bookshop got in on the act, tweeting a picture of a skeleton in their store . Using the hashtag #WaterstonesTexan, Twitter user _markgallagher suggested his experiences might be turned into a film, starring Colin Firth as the store manager, Keira Knightly as the check-out assistant, and Hugh Grant as the 'hapless' security guard. Some book lovers questioned why Mr Willis called for help at all, saying a night in a bookshop was too good an opportunity to miss, while others suggested alternatives - getting stuck in a chocolate factory or shop was a popular suggestion.","David Willis, of Dallas, Texas, said he was upstairs at store for 15 minutes .

"The walking stick always used by ex-Labour leader Michael Foot after the 1963 car crash that nearly claimed his life has been put up for sale by his family. Michael Foot, who died in 2010 at the age of 96, was often seen using his trusty wooden stick while out walking his dog near his home in Hampstead, London. Now his family hopes its sale at auction will raise more than £4,000 to help pay for a stone bench memorial in Plymouth in the Devonport constituency he represented for a decade. Michael Foot (pictured left and right), who died in 2010 at the age of 96, was often seen using his trusty wooden stick while out walking his dog near his home in Hampstead, London . The walking stick always used by ex-Labour leader Michael Foot (pictured) after the 1963 car crash that nearly claimed his life has been put up for sale by his family . Tom Foot said he ‘cannot remember a day’ when his great uncle Michael was not using the trusty support. The journalist wrote in the Independent: ‘The support of his wife, the film-maker Jill Craigie - and, after she died, of her friend Jenny Stringer, who came every day to check on him in his final 10 years - were perhaps matched in constancy only by this gnarled larch staff. ‘In old age, certainly when I was living with him in the last five years of his life, it would be used to prod out a secure footing on the steps or propel him pole-vault-style into a taxi to the Gay Hussar in Soho.’ Michael Foot was a Member of Parliament from 1945 to 1955 and from 1960 to 1992 and was deputy leader of the Labour Party from 1976 to 1980 later becoming the leader of the opposition from 1980 to 1983. The family of Michael Foot (pictured walking his dog in Hyde Park, London, hopes the sale of the walking stick will raise more than £4,000 to help pay for a stone bench memorial . In October 1963 he was involved in a car crash and suffered pierced lungs, broken ribs, and a broken left leg. It meant he had to use a walking stick for the rest of his life. Tom Foot revealed that although he may have used a number of walking sticks over the years, the one up for sale was his ‘number one choice’. A number of the others had been given away to friends and family with one given to novelist Salman Rushdie’s son . Tom Foot added: ‘We think the stick is now best used helping future generations remember what Michael stood for, rather than how he stood.’ The bench, which is set to cost £42,000, is being installed in Freedom Fields park, Plymouth, in the city of his birth and near his childhood home.","Family of Michael Foot hope to raise £4,000 from sale to pay for memorial .

"It was a day of peculiar reunions as Manchester United’s players returned to the club’s Carrington training ground for their first ball-playing sessions of pre-season on Monday morning. In the absence of newly appointed manager Louis van Gaal, assistant coach Ryan Giggs assumed responsibilities on the training field, but it was the make-up of the playing staff, rather than coaching staff, that was causing near jaw-ache among the chattering classes at the club’s AON Training Complex. All those players who did not appear at the World Cup in Brazil returned late last week for the usual rigorous medical testing to assess how their fitness had been maintained in the close season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Bebe scores another brilliant goal for Pacos de Ferreira . In charge: Ryan Giggs took Manchester United's first pre-season training in the absence of Louis van Gaal . International pedigree: Van Gaal will join up with United after Holland's World Cup campaign is over . First-team returnees included new signing Ander Herrera, Jonny Evans, Michael Carrick, Darren Fletcher, Tom Cleverley and Rafael Da Silva. However, there was also much consternation as several loanees returned to the club - including cast-offs such as the Portuguese winger Bebe and the Brazilian midfielder Anderson - with their tails firmly between their legs. Bebe was signed in a bizarre £7million . deal in the summer of 2011 - despite Sir Alex Ferguson later admitting . he had not seen the winger play - and the 23-year-old is still yet to . start a Barclays Premier League match four years later. Flop: £7million Bebe (left) was one of the players who reported to United's pre-season training on Monday . Change of scene: Anderson spent the second half of last season on loan to Serie A outfit Fiorentina . He was the one player immediately . written off by David Moyes last summer and it is understood that Louis . van Gaal will adopt the same approach towards a player with one year . left on a five-year contract. United will loan Bebe out for a third . consecutive season or sell him on a permanent deal if they can find a . buyer. Anderson, for his part, became a source . of frustration for Moyes over his perceived lack of fitness, evidenced . by the damning statistic that he has completed ninety minutes of Premier . League football on only 18% of the 104 appearances he has made in a . seven-year spell of fluctuating form at Old Trafford. He endured a stuttering loan spell at . Fiorentina in the second half of last season and United may encounter . trouble as they attempt to recoup in excess of £20m for the player . signed by Sir Alex Ferguson on the recommendation of his brother, . Martin, who said: ‘Alex, he’s better than (Wayne) Rooney.’ Familiar sight: Anderson has only completed 18% of the 104 Premier League appearances he has started . There was, however, excitement to see the return of several young and talented players to the club, including Wilfried Zaha from Cardiff, who is hoping to be granted a clean slate by Van Gaal after being frozen out by Moyes over his perceived failure to grasp the immaculate standards expected of a Manchester United player on the training ground. Nick Powell, who Sportsmail understands who would have been promoted into the first-team pool had Ferguson remained in charge last season, has also returned after a campaign with Wigan Athletic, along with 21-year-old forward Jesse Lingard from Brighton and Chilean striker Angelo Henriquez, who struggled to make an impact on loan at Real Zaragoza last season. Assistant manager Ryan Giggs is believed to have pencilled in meetings with every player for this week and he will advise Van Gaal over the right course of action with United’s young players, although any decision will ultimately be rubber-stamped the Dutchman.

"There was total apathy from England fans as Roy Hodgson's World Cup flops arrived back home on Wednesday - cosseted and indulged to the very end. There wasn't a single flag-waving supporter to greet the team's privately chartered Boeing 767 when it touched down at Manchester Airport at 1.17pm after the long flight from Rio de Janeiro. Going down: Wayne Rooney descends from the plane at Manchester airport after leaving Brazil . Last hurrah? Steven Gerrard, England's captain in Brazil, disembarks at Manchester airport .

Only a handful of photographers and a class from a primary school on a visit were there to watch coach Gary Neville lead a deflated group of players down the aircraft steps. Stars including Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and Joe Hart were then whisked away to their mansions in chauffeur-driven cars that waited for them on the runway at a private terminal. There was no welcoming party, either, an hour later at Luton airport where the remaining members of the hapless World Cup party disembarked. In 1990 thousands of fans thronged Luton airport to salute the England players who had reached a World Cup semi-final before being knocked out on penalties by West Germany. Paul Gascoigne appeared on the open-top bus wearing a pair of fake breasts. Welcoming committee: Italy fan Attilio Bruno was one of those ready to welcome England home .

"Walkers were warned of the dangers of foraging for wild mushrooms yesterday after dozens of cases of poisoning. Public Health England said 84 people have been poisoned by mushrooms and toadstools so far this year and the foraging season is only just under way. Dr John Thompson, director of the National Poisons Information Service in Cardiff, said: 'People really need to be aware of the very real potential dangers. Scroll down for video . Walkers have been warned of the dangers of foraging for wild mushrooms, such as Death Cap mushrooms (pictured), Amanita Phalloides, deadly poisonous  fungi . 'It is always at this time of year that we see a noticeable increase in poisoning cases. Many mushrooms growing in the wild are tasty and safe to eat, it is not always easy to differentiate between toxic and non-toxic species even for people with experience.' Last year, 237 cases of poisoning across the UK were recorded with many involving children under the age of ten. The dangers of foraging for mushrooms were highlighted in 2008 when the author of best-selling book The Horse Whisperer was taken to hospital. Nicholas Evans and three family members had to be put on kidney dialysis after eating toxic mushrooms they had gathered on a woodland walk. 'As the weather starts to change many people will soon be heading out to the countryside to seek out wild food which can be a really fun thing to do,' said Dr John Thompson, director of the NPIS unit in Cardiff. 'But when it comes to wild mushrooms people really need to be aware of the very real potential dangers involved. 'It is always at this time of year that we see a noticeable increase in poisoning cases. This is because while many mushrooms growing in the wild are tasty and safe to eat, it is not always easy to differentiate between toxic and non-toxic species even for people with experience in foraging. 'That's why we say that people should not eat mushrooms collected in the wild unless they are very familiar with the various types that grow in the UK and are sure that the mushrooms that they have collected are safe to eat.' Dr John Harrison, director of PHE's Centre for Radiation, Chemicals and Environmental Hazards, said: 'People heading outdoors this autumn, whether it's to gather wild mushrooms or just to enjoy the great British countryside, should be aware of the dangers that mushrooms can pose. Correctly identifying the mushrooms that are safe to pick and eat is the key to ensuring that foraging is good fun and does not endanger health.'","Walkers have been warned of the dangers of foraging for wild mushrooms .

"James Rodriguez - the undisputed star of this World Cup so far - says he dreams of playing in Spain and appeared to encourage an offer from Real Madrid. The Colombian has netted five times in his first four games in Brazil, including a stunning volley against Uruguay on Saturday night. While the 22-year-old has long since been known about as one of the brightest prospects in Europe, the last fortnight has shone a brighter light on his talent.

Tottenham have previously passed up the opportunity to land Rodriguez, with the player not holding back in his desire to play in La Liga. 'I’d be a dream to play in Spain, one of the best leagues in the world,' he is said to have told Spanish radio station Cadena Cope.

"The Ebola crisis has provided the latest opportunity for Democratic hopefuls in tough races  to set themselves apart from their beleaguered party head. Democratic Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina have both offered differing policies from President Barack Obama when it comes to handling the deadly disease, as has Georgia senate candidate Michelle Nunn. In the House at least nine Democrats, including Nick Rahall of West Virginia and Krysten Sinema of Arizona, have asked the president to revisit his decision not to block individuals flying out of West Africa from entering the U.S. Scroll down for video . Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor is one of a dozen Democrats who says he would take a different approach to fending off an Ebola epidemic than president Barack Obama. Unlike Obama, Pryor says he supports a temporary ban on travel to the U.S. from West Africa . President Barack Obama, right, is pictured here meeting with Ron Klain, then chief of staff to the Vice President, and Cynthia Hogan, counsel to the vice-president, in the Oval Office, in this May 21, 2009 photograph. Obama named Klain as his administration's Ebola response coordinator on Friday to Republicans' annoyance . Their efforts to show a clear distinction between the way they would respond to the Ebola outbreak and the president's actions comes as anger over Obama's response to the Ebola epidemic has escalated among Republicans, who are are now up in arms over his choice for Ebola czar. Lawmakers' divergence from the president's approach to managing the health scare mirrors a poll newly released by Politico  that shows that just 22 percent of likely voters in battleground states have 'a lot of confidence' that the government 'is doing everything possible to contain the spread of Ebola.' Another 33 percent said they have no or little confidence in the government's handling of the situation so far. And that survey was conducted before a third Ebola patient was diagnosed in the U.S. The poll did not ask what respondents would like to see the government do differently, but a survey conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post at roughly the same time found that two-thirds of Americans support a temporary moratorium on travel to the U.S. from the three West African countries being savaged by Ebola. Members of Congress have responded in kind, and more than a dozen Democrats now say they are in favor of travel restrictions. They join nearly a hundred of their Republican colleagues in demanding that the president do more to stop possible Ebola carriers from coming to the country. 'It is clear that the piece-meal approach to contain this outbreak is not enough. We need a comprehensive strategy,' Arkansas' Pryor said in a statement on Friday. 'It starts with a travel ban for non-citizens coming to the U.S. from affected areas and a stepped-up screening process conducted by health professionals for Americans returning from West Africa,' the incumbent senator, who is locked in a tight race for his seat with Arkansas GOP Rep. Tom Cotton, added. North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan speaks at a press conference on Wednesday, Oct. 15 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Hagan said then that a travel ban wouldn't 'help solve this problem.' On Friday she said she supports travel restrictions . Pryor's concise support for a travel ban follows an interview he did with MSNBC earlier this month in which he struggled to say whether the Obama administration had responded to Ebola appropriately and aggressively enough. 'Uhhhhmmm...' he told network correspondent Kasie Hunt. 'I would say that it's hard to know because I haven't heard the latest briefing on that.' North Carolina's Hagan also said that unlike the president, she supports a travel ban on Friday - just two days after saying at a news conference that it 'wouldn't help solve this problem' or 'contain the epidemic that we see happening in Africa.' Hagan said in a statement on Friday, 'I have said for weeks that travel restrictions should be one part of a broad strategy to prevent Ebola from spreading in the U.S. and fighting it in Africa. 'Although stopping the spread of this virus overseas will require a large, coordinated effort with the international community, a temporary travel ban is a prudent step the President can take to protect the American people, and I believe he should do so immediately.' Hagan's GOP opponent in the race, Thom Tillis, has said he's in favor of travel restrictions for several weeks. The Republican National Committee jumped on Hagan's change of heart on Friday and told the Daily Mail in an email on Monday that 'Senator Hagan did a full flip-flop.' 'She went from calling the proposed ban a ""scare tactic"" to essentially endorsing the proposed ban that Tillis put forward weeks ago,' RNC spokesman Rob Lockwood said. 'Senator Hagan should quit the games, acknowledge her 180 degree turn, and admit that Thom Tillis was right all along on this issue.' Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate Michelle Nunn, right, hugs a supporter at a rally last Wednesday before casting her own ballot in early voting at the Adamsville Recreation Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Nunn also came out in favor of a travel ban on Friday . In Georgia, Democratic senate candidate and non-profit head Nunn sided with her potential colleagues and voiced her support for a travel ban on Friday, too. 'I support a temporary travel ban with the exceptions of our medical and military personnel in those affected areas in West Africa and I believe that we need to look to our medical practitioners, leaders and scientists and make sure we’re giving them the resources,' Nunn told the Washington Post. In a similar statement released the same day Nunn also contended that 'our leaders in Washington must provide clear, bipartisan and strong leadership as well as the resources we need to stop the spread of Ebola.' The Georgia Democrat was involved in a short-lived controversy last week when she refused to tell a tracker for a Republican organization whether she voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. She confirmed to the Post on Friday that she did vote for Obama while touting her bipartisan credentials. Nunn's Republican opponent in the race, businessman David Perdue, has attacked her as a rubber stamp for Obama's policies and released an ad featuring a photo of her and Obama. Today she released an ad explaining why she was pictured with the president and that the photo was taken at an event for her non-profit that held in honor of former President George HW Bush. Democrats in the House have also been quick to separate themselves from the ostracized president, whose approval rating has consistently been underwater throughout the election cycle. In addition to West Virginia's Rahall and Arizona's Sinema, John Barrow of Georgia, Alan Grayson of Florida, Dave Loebsack of Iowa, Scott Peters of California,  David Scott of Georgia, Collin Peterson, Minnesota and Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii have joined the procession of Democratic lawmakers lobbying the president to institute a travel ban. President Barack Obama, center, stands with Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, left, and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, during an early voting and campaign rally for Illinois Quinn at Chicago State University on Sunday. Quinn is one of the few Democrats up for reelection this year who is willing to tie himself to Obama . Even vulnerable Democrats have not been nearly as vocal as Republicans in critiquing the president over Ebola, however. Republicans went from upset to outraged with the president on Friday after he announced his pick for Ebola czar. After arguing that the White House needed to designate one administration official to direct its response to the heath scare, Republicans got their wish on Friday when Obama brought on Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to two vice presidents, to act as its Ebola response coordinator. They immediately began disparaging Klain's credentials, though, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz led the charge, arguing on Friday and again on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday that Klain has no business managing a health crisis. 'Mr. Klain is not a doctor. He's not a health care professional. He doesn't have background in these issues,' Cruz said. 'We don't need a White House political operative, which is what Mr. Klain has been. 'What we need is presidential leadership. The person who needs to be on top of this is the president of the United States,' Cruz stated. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions also came out swinging against Klain on Friday, saying in a statement that the 'American people can have zero confidence in Ron Klain’s competence to carry out this critical role.' 'Ebola is a health crisis. Yet the President has appointed as his new Ebola ‘czar’ a partisan loyalist whose expertise is politics—not health,' Sessions argued. 'One would think, faced with the prospect of an epidemic, the President would task an expert in epidemiology not an expert in political spin.

The installation will remain on display until Armistice Day on November 11, when the last poppy is planted. Afterwards, they will be taken up and posted to their new owners after every single poppy was sold for £25 each to raise funds for military charities, including Help for Heroes and Combat Stress.

"Former prime minister Gough Whitlam's childhood home was expected to be demolished within weeks . The house where former prime minister Gough Whitlam is believed to have been born on the kitchen table 98 years ago is set to be demolished and possibly replaced by a 'McMansion'. The three-bedroom home in the affluent suburb of Kew, in east Melbourne, which went under the hammer for $3.3million last year, was given the tick of approval to be ripped down just one week before Whitlam passed away on Tuesday. Whitlam's parents took out a house mortgage at the beginning of 1915 and the home was built by May that same year. Boroondara council attempted to save the home after declaring it was of 'local individual heritage significance' due to Whitlam living in the house for the first two years of his life until the family moved to Sydney with his father's job in 1918. The council received a demolition order for the 46 Rowland Street site, known as 'Ngara,' in April followed by a nomination for heritage protection of the house later that month. Following an investigation, the council deemed the home as heritage-worthy due to Whitlam's childhood links to the property before it lodged a heritage protection request to the Victorian Planning Minister in May. However, the planning department rejected the application in September because the demolition order was already approved before receiving the heritage request, the ABC reported. The house, built in 1915, at 46 Rowland Street has been relatively untouched since the 1920s . The home in the affluent suburb of Kew was sold for $3.3million in November last year . Whitlam's parents built the home in 1915 after taking out a mortgage . A order to demolish the property was issued by a private builder just seven days before Whitlam's passing on Tuesday, The Age reported. Following the sale last year, the home was listed on realestate.com.au as displaying 'splendid original character and grand room proportions offer endless scope to renovate/extend or perhaps create a luxurious new home.' Former owner Gerald Swinnerton, who sold the house in January, met Whitlam, along with his parents, when the politician visited his childhood home in the 1960s. 'He turned up in a Commonwealth car,' Mr Swinnerton told the ABC. 'We had afternoon tea together, and found him to be a charming and congenial fellow.' The Whitlams took a mortgage out from the State Savings Bank of Victoria on 30 January 1915 to build the family home which was completed by May that same year, the Property Observer reported. The announcement of Whitlam's birth was published as taking place at Ngara, Rowland Street, East Kew. Legend has it - that Whitlam was delivered on the kitchen table in the home the following year after it was built. However, two years after his birth, the family uprooted to Sydney after his father, Fred Whitlam, was promoted to deputy Crown solicitor . The living area is one of many rooms with box and bay windows in the home . The house features a large formal dining room and lead light windows looking onto the garden . Whitlam is believed to have been born on the kitchen table in the Kew home in 1916 . Mr Swinnerton said before he and his brother made the sale they expressed their preference for the new owner to only make renovations to the house. 'It's my view that a plaque should be placed in the pavement outside the house,' he said. Neighbour Oliver Barrett said he expected the house, which has been relatively untouched since the 1920s, to be pulled down within a couple of weeks as the demolition process had already begun. He said the fact that many people had visited the home since Whitlam died proved its historical significance. 'We'll lose a large bit of Australian history,' he told the ABC. The house currently features a large formal living and dining room - along with a sun room and box and bay windows.","Gough Whitlam's childhood home set to be demolished within weeks .

"Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm? Is there any way back? At what point is enough is enough and football begins to turn its back on Luis Suarez? As news began to sink about this latest, remarkable controversy to engulf Suarez, the calls for him to be banished from the game for an indefinite period were long and loud. Three strikes and you are out, so the theory goes. ‘I do not want to see one of the best players in the world banned from this tournament but you cannot have that example,’ former England manager Glenn Hoddle said on ITV. ‘You do that in a street somewhere and you are going to prison.’ Scroll down for videos...

FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings, to which Uruguay and Suarez have until 9pm UK time on Wednesday to provide evidence.

Click here for the full story . There is no defending Suarez. Biting PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal in November 2010 could have been considered an aberration but to repeating the transgression on Branislav Ivanovic of Chelsea (April 2013) and now Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini highlights an underlying behavioural problem. Suarez, for some reason, doesn’t learn but what he may now discover in the wake of this absurd moment in Natal is that the trust managers and team-mates have for him begins to slowly dwindle away. How can you rely on someone that has the ability to let you down? From now on, that question will lurk in the back of everyone’s mind. He might be a genius, one of the most spell-binding players in the world when at the peak of his powers, but that habit of going wildly off the rails is going to be his legacy. What happens with him now will make for intriguing viewing. A move to Barcelona has been mooted and the signs that have been coming from Spain in the last few days was that a bid to prise him away from Anfield was looming. But will . this controversy force Barcelona to abort? They pride themselves on the . motto ‘mes que une club’ (more than a club) but will they go him for him . now? Given the turmoil they have experienced in the past year over the . deal to sign Neymar, do they need to bring more trouble to their door?

There will, inevitably, be ramifications for Liverpool too. Should he stay on Merseyside, he will be the subject of intense scrutiny, critics will be waiting for him to step out of line and ask how they can continue to offer support when he has besmirched their reputation. Yet ask Brendan Rodgers or any of his team-mates and they will all tell you the same thing about him around the training ground: he is quite and humble, never any trouble. He comes in, relishes his work then goes home to dote on his family. They don’t see the monster that others do. Red leader: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (R) has always supported Luis Suarez . Family guy: Off the pitch, Luis Suarez is renowned for being a doting father . They see a world class player and that is why, regardless of the shock and horror of this bite on Chiellini, he won’t fail to have a career at the highest level. ‘I’m staggered but it won’t affect him,’ said former England captain Alan Shearer on Match of the Day. ‘There will always be someone who is prepared to take a gamble on him.’ Yet there will always be that anxiety with Luis Suarez that a moment of madness is never far away.","Luis .

"Former President George W. Bush said Thursday that his brother Jeb, the former Florida Governor, 'wants to be president' – but he hasn't made up his mind yet about running in 2016. 'He and I did a conversation,' the folksy former president said during a Fox News Channel interview. 'I, of course, was pushing him to run for president. He, of course, was saying, ""I haven't made up my mind"".' 'And I truly don't think that he has,' Bush said. 'And plus I don't think he liked it that his older brother was pushing him.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former President George W. Bush sat for a TV interview on the Fox News Channel, saying he's urging his brother Jeb to make a run for the White House in 2016 . The younger Bush, once Florida's governor, hasn't signaled yet whether he's open to campaigning for the top job in America's government . Jeb Bush is part of a crowded potential field for the Republicans in 2016; his absence from public events has resulted in middling poll numbers. The moderate base of the GOP is urging him to run as an alternative to seeking a third attempt for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. But the tea party wing of conservatives paints him as a 'RINO' – Republican In Name Only. 'I think he wants to be president,' George W. Bush said. 'I think he'd be a great president.' 'He understands what it’s like to be president ... He’s seen his dad, he’s seen his brother. And so, he’s a very thoughtful man and he’s weighing his options.' The former chief executive also said he won't play armchair general and criticize the decisions President Barack Obama has made about military activity in the Middle East. But he said he agreed with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey's recommendation at the time that the U.S. leave a 'residual force' behind in Iraq instead of withdrawing completely. 'I did, yeah. ... I agreed with General Dempsey's assessment.' Obama famously pulled all U.S. troops from Iraq after Bush had spent most of his presidency spending heavily to stabilize that country. The results of what military rank-and-file have taken to calling 'the Obama bug-out' included the rise of the ISIS terror army to fill the power vacuum left by retreating American forces. Bush said he thought the U.S. should have left a residual military force in Iraq to fend off chaos, but insisted he's not going to play armchair general in his post-presidential years . Jeb Bush, seen on Tuesday riding a leaf blower-powered hovercraft made by students for a science fair, is seen as a political moderate who won't win plaudits from the GOP's tea party wing . 'The president has to make the choices he thinks are important,' Bush said Thursday. 'I'm not going to second-guess our president. I understand how tough the job is.' 'And to have a former president bloviating and second-guessing, I don't think is good for the presidency or the country. He and his team will make the best-informed decisions they can make.' Bush said he had great confidence in Joe Clancy, the interim Secret Service director who has taken the agency's reins following the sudden resignation of former director Julia Pierson. Clancy 'is a good man,' he said. 'And I trust his judgment a lot. Joe will do a good job.' Bush has spent his post-presidency years staying largely away from TV cameras, working on his memoirs and learning to paint. He said he doesn't miss the White House pressure cooker. 'I'm asked all the time, do I miss Washington?' he noted. 'And the answer is no.' 'You know, I miss being pampered. Other than that I don't miss much.' But he seemed to take a jab at Obama for his recent 'latte salute,' in which the president half-heartedly saluted a pair of Marines with a coffee cup in his right hand. 'I do miss saluting men and women who have volunteered to serve our nation,' Bush said.","Former US president spoke on the Fox News Channel before the second day of a charity golf tournament benefiting veterans .

"Archaeologists have uncovered an ancient village in Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park that is 1,300 years old. The settlement built by basketmaker people, which dates back to between 200 AD and 700 AD, is made up of pit-houses built into the ground with walls made from sandstone slabs. Artefacts including stone tools, spear points, scrapers and knives, made out of petrified wood, shells and small early ceramics were also unearthed. Last year, ruins of a multi-story house were discovered nearby that may have been part of a basket-making trade network. Ancient: The settlement discovered in Arizona dates back to between 200 AD and 700 AD, is made up of pit-houses built into the ground with walls made from sandstone slabs . Discovery: The flags set up in the Petrified Forest indicate where items of pottery were found . The basketmaker community was discovered as part of a project which has increased since the National Park Service doubled the park's size after Congress passed the Petrified Forest National Park Expansion Act of 2004. Bill Reitze, the park's archaeologist, told ABC News: 'There are not a lot of national parks that have the opportunity to get bigger like this to protect sites and produce future research. 'A lot of archaeology happens in response to development. What makes this unique is new sites are discovered, research [is] being done and all these sites are being protected, all at once. 'It's really interesting because it really allows us to see on a larger scale things we've noticed in other areas in the park,' More than 600 archaeological sites have been found inside the boundaries of Petrified Forest National Park. Evidence suggests that the earliest inhabitants of the park arrived at least 8,000 years ago. The newly-discovered village dates back to the basketmaker period a post-archaic stage in American history that followed the Ancient Pueblo People. Jewelry: One of the objects that was unearthed was a pendant (right) that seemed to have been carved from sandstone or siltstone . Violence: The archaeologists also found a stone with a serrated edge which could have been used as a weapon when it was thrown . The basketmaker people, or ancient Pueblo people lined in a large region including parts of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico in the U.S. They lived in the region from around 1,500BC to 800AD. The culture was named basketmaker because of the large number of intricate baskets found at archaeological sites of 3,000 to 2,000 years ago. Some mummies have been found in dry caves and show that both women and men were only just over five ft tall. They had long, narrow faces and were of a stocky build, which perhaps explains the broad-shouldered petroglyph style. Men often wore fancy hairstyles, while women wore their hair short. They also wore yucca plant fibre sandals and loincloths perhaps, but both sexes wore necklaces made of shell, bone and dried berries.

"A raging Jimmy Connors making the roof fall in; Vitas Gerulaitis coming in at breakfast time straight from a night out before playing his match; a magical moment with Andy Murray just after he won the title. These are just a few of the gems in the treasure chest of memories Doug Dickson took away with him from 44 years of looking after generations of stars in the locker rooms of Wimbledon. He left the All England Club last summer after stumbling into the job during the summer of 1969 and feels ‘privileged’ to have seen close up the world’s greatest players experience the private agony of defeat and the ecstasy of victory. Raging: Jimmy Connors, always a character, made the roof fall in, Doug Dickson says . As a steward in the inner sanctum of Wimbledon’s main locker room, he bears unique witness to Wimbledon history. Dickson (no relation) spent the last 18 years as head steward and it ended in fairytale fashion on the last day of his last Championships, with fellow Scot Andy Murray ending the 77-year wait for a British men’s champion. While Dickson’s love for tennis and all its players shines through, it is clear Murray is among his favourites. One of his duties was to carry out the racket bags of the men’s finalists onto court and supervise their removal at the end. So it was that he was the first  person to encounter the new champion when he stepped off  Centre Court on that heady afternoon 12 months ago. Long service: Doug Dickson, pictured with one of the rackets Andy Murray used in the 2013 final, was a locker room attendant at Wimbledon for 44 years . ‘The first thing Andy said to me was “Don’t I get a hug then?” so I gave him a hug. But I just couldn’t speak, I was too choked up for him,’ says Dickson. It tells you something about Murray’s true character that the  following Friday, Dickson’s last day at work, the champion went back to the All England Club to say goodbye, presenting him with a signed racket he used in the final. ‘It is my most treasured possession  but that’s the kind of bloke Andy is and maybe people don’t always see,’ says Dickson. ‘He is basically a very kind and thoughtful person, with a great sense of humour, too.’ Not so happy: Connors smashed open a ceiling after a first round loss at Wimbledon one year . Dickson also witnessed players at their most angry and frustrated and one afternoon in 1986 with Connors stands out. He says: ‘Jimmy was an amazing competitor and character and he had lost in the first round. He came in afterwards and hurled his racket at the ceiling. ‘The problem was that at the time it was one of these false ceilings of thin panels held up by thin metal plates. Somehow he completely dislodged a number of them and left a huge hole, with all the dust and debris that had accumulated on top crashing down. ‘He was so angry that he stripped off to his jockstrap and socks and stormed off down the corridor to the transport room, right by the entrance to the Royal Box. ‘My colleague, Leo Turner, had to run after him and cover him with a towel so there wouldn’t be any  surprises for anyone coming out of the Box. He was driven off straight away.’ It is the hugely charismatic former world No 3 Gerulaitis — who was to die tragically young at 40 —  who left the biggest imprint. Gift: Through all the years of experience at the Championships, Murray's parting present was special . ‘I never met anyone with such a sheer appetite for life,’ says Dickson. ‘He came in one morning about eight o’clock in jeans and a smart jacket and told me that he hadn’t been to bed yet. ‘So I found him a physio’s couch in a quiet corner to lie down. I gave him a shake and a cup of coffee  an hour later and he was straight  up and about. Then he went out  a bit later and won his match.’ Unthinkable now but it was a  different age when Dickson, an accountant by training, first arrived at SW19. Rod Laver was the big beast back then and was halfway through winning all four majors. ‘Rod was quite a shy, quiet man,’ says Dickson. ‘What marked him and Ken Rosewall out was that it was clear they were very much there for business. ‘There were still a lot of guys from the amateur days around but those two were extremely professional.’ The advent of Bjorn Borg heralded the start of the great tennis boom of the Seventies and Eighties, with unprecedented scenes of adulation at the All England Club. ‘It was like The Beatles and caused quite a few problems,’ Dickson recalls. ‘For the first time security and protection was needed to get him from his car into the main building because he was getting mobbed, mainly by young girls. ‘Some people at the club were very uncomfortable with it all. Inside the locker room he had this Zen-like calm. The biggest challenge for us was finding somewhere to put his rackets. In those days players still might have only two or three but Bjorn would come in with 18 or 20, sometimes we’d just have to pile them on top of the lockers.’ And then came the incomparable John McEnroe, another star Dickson especially liked, along with Pat Cash. He says: ‘I’d talk a lot with John because I was into American sports. ‘He was just this American college kid when he first came in. He was very different off the court to on it. One thing he did was always keep a racket back in his locker at room temperature — when word came from the court that he wanted his spare racket you knew he was  having a bad day.’ Dickson rarely saw tempers fray between players in the locker room and, while he wants to keep such incidents private, he makes the interesting observation that the cause is often something said during matches by an opponent’s entourage or over enthusiastic support. Popular: Borg was the first player who needed security to get him from his car into the main building . In the present era a calmer  example is set by the top players. ‘Roger [Federer] was a bit hotheaded as a junior but you could quickly tell the others feared him because he was so good,’ says  Dickson. ‘He is very statesman-like and reminds me a bit of Laver because of the business-like way he goes about things. ‘The small thing I’ll remember about Novak [Djokovic] was how brilliant he was at geography. ‘There was this computer game the players liked in which you had to pinpoint cities on a blank map of Europe, he was incredibly good at it, he is very intelligent. ‘He has become different from most in that he now spends hardly any time in the locker room, he’ll plan it so he only comes in the  minimal time before his matches. Rafa [Nadal] — you can’t help but like him, there is still this boy-next-door quality and he is incredibly nice with people. After a good win Rafa likes to celebrate with an ice cream, so it was important to make sure that the freezer was stocked with them.’ These days the main locker room is open to the world’s top 50, the top four doubles pairings, plus players who are All England Club members, regardless of their rankings, such as past champions. Gone are the exposed pipes and communal baths, replaced by power showers, treatment rooms and private bathrooms — except they are never used for baths as most people would know them. ‘I haven’t run a hot bath for anyone for about 15 years,’ says Dickson. ‘If anyone goes in the bath it’s for an ice bath — or they go in there to have some privacy and maybe shed some tears in private. ‘It’s important to know when to leave people alone and that’s where they’ll often go. ‘Players have different ways of reacting to defeat. ‘Anders Jarryd [the Swedish former top-10 singles player] had this ritual where he would come in after a loss and stare in silence at his locker for up to an hour. Then he would physically rip the shirt off himself and move on, as if he had achieved closure.’ Watchful eye: Djokovic's practice is watched over by coach Boris Becker as he limbers up at SW19 . As tennis has evolved into a massive international business with huge prize money, the atmosphere has become more serious, although not without elements of fun. ‘The putting competition has become a big thing now, almost  everyone joins in,’ says Dickson. ‘It started with someone bringing in one of those cup-like golf holes that spit the ball out but now it’s become almost like crazy golf. ‘The hole has become so long that they start it in the showers. ‘There is still a lot of banter. All tennis players seem to be football crazy and that’s what a lot of it is about. ‘An important thing in the years of a big football championship is to make sure you get the right matches on the TVs along with the tennis.’ That will be the case this year but one of the most established fixtures in the locker room will not be there to supervise it, gone the same way as many of the traditional features at an institution which has ruthlessly renewed itself. There will be many players who miss the avuncular, reassuring  presence of a familiar figure in  his white steward’s coat — and the feeling will be mutual. Doug Dickson's last day working during a Wimbledon fortnight was quite special... it was the day Andy Murray ended Britain’s 77-year wait for a men’s champion. And Murray made it even more special the following Friday. It was Dickson’s last official day at work and Murray,  now the proud Wimbledon champion, returned to the All England Club to say farewell and present his fellow Scot with one of the rackets he had used in the final. ‘It is my most treasured possession,’ says Dickson, ‘But that’s the kind of bloke Andy is.’ Special day: Dickson (left) carries the bags of Andy Murray (centre) and Novak Djokovic before the 2013 final .","Mike Dickson talks to retired Wimbledon locker room attendant Doug Dickson .

"With Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo heading towards 30, the look-out is on for a new generation of stars to make football glamorous into the next decade. Neymar and Gareth Bale spring to mind and if last night’s dazzling display in the Maracana is anything to go by, Colombia’s James Rodriguez could end up the likeliest lad of all. The 22-year-old had a growing reputation before this tournament – after his two brilliant goals against Uruguay the hype is now ready to go through the roof. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Colombia hero James Rodriguez practise free-kicks . Football's next superstar? James Rodriguez has lit up the World Cup so far . Usurped... for now: He currently sits ahead of Lionel Messi in the race for the Golden boot . Back home: And Cristiano Ronaldo, who has already gone back to Portugal, managed just one . His stunning first rivalled Tim Cahill for volley of the tournament. The second was all about striker’s instinct following a good team move. Put simply, the reason it’s Colombia - and not Uruguay – who will face Brazil in the World Cup quarter-final is down to one man. For that, we should all be grateful to him. There was a bit of head-scratching when Monaco paid £37million for Rodriguez a year ago. Now we know what all the fuss is about. Given the No10 shirt for the World Cup, Rodriguez opted to put his first name, James (pronounced Ham-ez) on the back, no doubt to the delight of his marketing men. Having scored in all of his group games against Greece, Japan and Ivory Coast, yesterday was the real test against opponents who know how to defend and were highly motivated after the Luis Suarez furore. He passed it with flying colours. Uruguay defended stoutly for 28 minutes.  Then, Rodriguez found a little pocket of space outside the penalty area – and that is all he needed. As Abel Aguilar cushioned a header into his path, he took a perfect first touch on his chest, serenely swivelled 180 degrees and sent a dipping left-foot volley that dipped neatly under the crossbar. An exquisite finish and he even had the presence of mind to lead the hip-swivelling goal celebration afterwards that is a tribute to Colombia’s other famous export, Shakira. Belt: Rodriguez's stunning first could rival Tim Cahill for volley of the tournament . James: The Colombia star has chosen to have his first name on the back of his shirt . His second goal after 50 minutes killed Uruguay’s hopes. To prove his range, this was simple and deadly, a ghosted run into the penalty area to convert Juan Cuadrado’s headed assist from close range, this time with his right foot. A brilliant team goal. Every big club in Europe, the Premier League’s top guns included, will want Rodriguez now. He leads the race for the World Cup golden boot with five goals. The only other player to have scored in every game is Messi. Rodriguez has a long way to go but one day he may take the Argentine’s crown as the best in the world.","Rodriguez could be lead the next generation of stars of world football .

"He has arguably dominated the world through his media empire for several decades, and now Rupert Murdoch looks set to take over the skies. But rather than jet off from the seat of a cockpit, the News Corp chairman today launched his first mission into modest altitudes from the comfort of a remote control he used to navigate a drone. The media giant, who was attending a digital technology conference, WSJD Live, in Laguna Beach, California, soon after posted a photo of the premier voyage on his personal Twitter account. The media giant launched his first drone - which many believe are an unwanted intrusion in their lives . Murdoch, 83, is seen here navigating the miniature plane which can be fitted with cameras and other devices . Murdoch, 83, said in a short statement to announce his take-off: ‘Trying out my new drone.’ But for the media tycoon,  not everyone responded kindly to the mission with some on social media hitting out at News Corp's record of privacy in the wake of the phone hacking trials. The Daily Rupert @TheMurdochTimes, wrote: 'Rupert Murdoch has a drone. Can it remotely hack phones and computers (as well as spy on celebrities)? He won't say'. Another, Spy Scroll @SpyScroll, said: 'Rupert Murdoch flies a drone – Twitter responds: Rupert Murdoch has a drone. Can it remotely hack phones ...' Many fear that drones, which can be equipped with cameras, will be another unwanted intrusion into their lives. They can be bought in shops and can be controlled with iPhones and iPads. Hobby enthusiasts and paparazzi are known to use the electronic planes which have sparked a privacy debate over mass use of the electronic devices. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), America's airspace management body, in September reversed its ban on the commercial use of drones. The FAA approved exemptions for six aerial production companies to use the miniature planes for the purpose of filming motion pictures and TV programs. The New York-based Wall Street Journal, which is a Murdoch-owned title, hosted the digital conference today. Major players in the Tech world turned up including including Apple chief executive Tim Cook, former Microsoft executive Steve Ballmer, Alibaba chief Jack Ma and also director James Cameron.","Media giant launches his first drone from the comfort of a remote control .

"Ahead of Argentina's World Cup . semi-final clash with Louis van Gaal's Holland in Sao Paulo, Sportsmail . takes a closer look at Alejandro Sabella's side. Player of the tournament: Lionel Messi (5 games, 4 goals) With the exception of Brazil and Neymar, no side in the competition has relied so heavily on their star player. Four of Argentina’s five games have needed a sprinkle of Messi magic to drag Alejandro Sabella’s side back from the abyss. Without the four-time Ballon d’Or winner they probably wouldn’t have made it out of their group. VIDEO Scroll down for Argentina's team profile and qualifying highlights . Star man: Lionel Messi celebrates after helping Argentina into the semi-finals with victory against Belgium . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi . Tournament highlight: Angel di Maria's goal vs Switzerland . Argentina made it far more difficult to beat Switzerland than it should have been, after failing to convert one of their 28 chances in the 117 minutes prior to Angel Di Maria’s well-taken match-winner. Messi, unsurprisingly, was the architect. His wonderful assist, that saw him drive at the heart of Switerland’s defence from a central position before laying the ball off to Di Maria, conjured up memories of Diego Maradona setting up Claudio Caniggia against Brazil in 1990. Unstoppable: Angel di Maria's extra-time winner against Switzerland owed much to Messi's build-up play . Lowlight: Their over-reliance on Messi . ‘Every time we recover the ball, we try to pass to him as he's the best player we have,’ said Pablo Zabaleta after their last-16 win against Switzerland. This dependence has been far too evident at times. Despite boasting some outstanding talents in attack, the likes of Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain and Ezequiel Lavezzi have failed to reproduce their club form in Brazil, putting more pressure on Messi to make the difference. Fortunately for them the Barcelona man has duly obliged. Impact: Gonzalo Higuain (left) scored the winner against Belgium but Argentina have been too reliant on Messi . Best goal: Messi v Iran, 1-0 group stage, Estadio Mineirao, Belo Horizonte . The two-time World Cup winners were on the brink of an embarrassing draw with Iran that would have both seriously dented their confidence and put their place in the knockout stages in doubt, when up stepped Messi. Picking the ball up 30 yards from goal in the 91st minute, he drifted in from the right and curled an unstoppable left-foot strike into the far corner to make it two wins from two. Stunner: Messi bends the ball into the top corner from outside the box to seal a late 1-0 win against Iran . How has the boss performed? Argentina . are in the last four because of Messi, not Alejandro Sabella. Throughout the tournament there have been rumours circulating that . Sabella has little respect from the players within the Argentina camp, . particularly following a bust-up with Messi at half-time in their . opening match against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Reports in Argentina and Spain . suggest their captain ‘ordered’ Sabella to switch from a 5-3-2 to a . 4-3-3 and bring on Fernando Gago and Gonzalo Higuain for the second . half. Argentina have played 4-3-3 in every match since. In control? Rumours have circulated that Alejandro Sabella does not have the respect of some Argentina players . Top scorer: Lionel Messi (4 goals) Killer stat: The four strikers that Sabella chose to support Messi in Brazil scored 83 goals between them at top clubs in Europe last season. Sergio Aguero, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Gonzalo Higuain and Rodrigo Palacios have one between them at this World Cup. Results in 9pm kick-offs: Played 0, W 0, D 0, L 0 .

"Ann Edmead (pictured outside Snaresbrook Crown Court today)  is accused of raping and indecently assaulting the alleged victim between 1973 and 1979 . A 72-year-old transsexual has been accused of sexually abusing a schoolboy in the 1970s when she was living as a man. Ann Edmead, from Bethnal Green, east London, is accused of raping and indecently assaulting the alleged victim between 1973 and 1979, when the boy was aged between 12 and 17. Edmead appeared frail and trembled when she was asked to stand to enter her pleas at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London today. She leaned heavily on her walking stick as she entered the court. Edmead had a sex change in 1982 and has written fictional books loosely based on her life story and her upbringing in a children’s home. She would have been between the ages of 31 and 37 at the time of the alleged offences. Judge Neil Sanders told her: ‘I’m sure this doesn't apply in your case, but if you don’t attend on the day of trial a warrant could be issued for your arrest and the trial could commence without you.’ She is accused of three serious sexual offences, one of indecent assault and one of gross indecency. Her trial is due to start on March 2 next year. Edmead, who had a sex change in 1982, appeared at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London (pictured) today .

"Dundee United have accepted a £3million bid from Sporting Lisbon for superkid Ryan Gauld. The 18-year-old is set to fly out for talks with the Portuguese giants and the deal is expected to be concluded later this week. The . teenage midfielder became known as “Baby Messi” for his dazzling . dribbling and low centre of gravity as he tormented Scottish defences . when he burst onto the scene last season as United finished fourth in . the Scottish Premiership and reached the Scottish Cup Final. Moving abroad: Dundee United's Ryan Gauld, second left, was on great form last season . Over the past year, Gauld, from . Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, has been scouted by Real Madrid, Roma, . Manchester United and Arsenal. And while Dundee United were not under pressure to sell they felt unable to turn down a bid of that size for a teenager. Last . season, the down-to-earth Gauld played down comparisons with the . Argentinian great but revealed he would love to play abroad one day . rather than grace the English Premier League. ‘The comparison to Messi is quite laughable, but it is good to read,’ he said. ‘I . look up to Messi because he’s the best in the world. Every young boy . should be watching and trying to emulate him in training. Don’t be an . ordinary person, go and try something special. ‘Growing . up, I watched the Spanish Leagues and prefer that style. Getting the . ball down and being patient with the build-up play. In England, it’s . maybe more direct. If you are a winger, you are expected to take on a . full-back and get a cross in. Abroad, you can turn out, keep the ball . and just keep the attack going. You also see players who are smaller in . stature. VIDEO Gauld scores a brace for Dundee Utd . So skillful: Lionel Messi has been in exceptional form for Argentina during the World Cup . ‘In England, it’s . more athletes. Being a smaller guy, I need to think about what’s best . for me and what’s best around me and I think being abroad is the best . culture of football for me.” Gauld . and his close friend, the United defender John Souttar – who was the . subject of a failed £600,000 bid by Sunderland last season - were both . coached intensively as kids by Ian Cathro at his respected Dundee soccer . clinics.

"Marouane Fellaini’s World Cup campaign has essentially become one big Barclays Premier League audition after it emerged that new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has instructed the club to sell him. Fellaini — an unmitigated disaster during his first season at Old Trafford last term — scored when coming on as a late substitute in Belgium’s opening game here in Brazil. He has played every minute of the three victories that have followed. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fellaini saying he wants to be a Man Utd legend . Audition: United hope Marouane Fellaini's displays in Brazil will help them recoup their £27m investment . But it is understood that Van Gaal has told associates Fellaini is ‘not a United type of player’ and has instructed chief executive Ed Woodward to sell him before the season starts. Old Trafford sources have revealed this week that Van Gaal has been quite clear about who he wants and doesn’t want and has told Woodward already. All that remains to be seen is whether United can sell Fellaini for anything near the £27million they paid when buying him from Everton last September. Boost: Belgium's Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed something of a renaissance at World Cup . Sacked United manager David Moyes consistently defended Fellaini last season and used to say that the 26-year-old was Belgium’s ‘stand-out player whenever I went to see them play’. Now it appears that Fellaini must show that form during the remainder of this tournament if he is to get a decent move ahead of the Premier League season, which starts next month. High point: Marouane Fellaini, left, has helped Belgium reach the last eight in Brazil . With Belgium through to face Argentina in the last eight of the World Cup, it is unlikely Fellaini will join United on their two-week tour of America that begins on July 21.

Women who went on such wild getaways knocked back an average 20 units of alcohol a day – the equivalent of two bottles of wine – while men sank 27 units. More than a third (37 per cent) admitted they were hung over every morning during their trip. The study by online travel agents sunshine.co.uk questioned 2,764 UK adults aged 40 and over, all of whom have been abroad this year. The most popular holidays were cruising breaks (38 per cent) and laid-back beach breaks (31 per cent), but 24 per cent had been on a holiday usually associated with younger people.

"Arsenal may be the team to benefit from Italy's early exit from the World Cup with under-fire Mario Balotelli prepared to consider a move away from AC Milan, according to his agent. While AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani has defended the 23-year-old striker for his performances in Brazil, another club vice-president Barbara Berlusconi hinted at the possibility of a Balotelli transfer this summer by saying he is 'replaceable'.

'If for her Mario is replaceable, she should set up a meeting in the club's headquarters and we will find a solution, just as I am used to doing. 'I remember that Mario had other important offers. 'He (Balotelli) is at Milan because of his heart - her (Berlusconi), I don't know.' A lot of disappointed Italian fans have vented their frustrations at Balotelli, who scored just one goal in three appearances in Brazil.

"An innocent husband who reported his wife missing was only told she was dead when he was arrested for her murder. The body of mother-of-five Angela Edwards was found just 200 yards from the home she shared with her husband of six years, Stephen Edwards, in St Helens in Lancashire. The 38-year-old only found out his wife was dead after police told him he was being held on suspicion of murder. He remained on police bail for his wife's funeral, but police have now ditched the murder inquiry and dropped all action current and future against him. They said they believe her death is not likely to have been suspicious. Mr Edwards said: 'In the space of two days I lost my wife, my life fell apart and I found myself locked in a cell. Stephen Edwards only discovered his wife, a mother of five, was dead when police wrongly arrested him for her murder. The couple had been married for six years and police have now ditched the murder inquiry . 'It was awful - it's the kind of thing you never think is going to happen to you. 'I'm obviously relieved to now have that suspicion off my shoulders - but I knew all along that nothing was going to happen because I hadn't done anything wrong.' Mr Edwards was a carer for his wife who was unable to work because she had bipolar disorder and had slipped a disc. The couple have seven children between them from previous relationships. Mrs Edwards had four daughters, a son and two grandchildren. She was reported missing on September 19 by her husband, and her body was then discovered in undergrowth in fields at about 3pm the following day. Floral tributes have been placed close to where she was found, remembering a 'happy woman' who was loved by local children in St Helens. Mr Edwards, 38, worked as  a full time carer for his wife, who had bipolar disorder and  a slipped disc . Mr Edwards was initially arrested on suspicion of wounding after a spot of blood was found in their kitchen and was then told he was being held on suspicion of murder. A spokesman for Merseyside Police said that Mr Edwards had been released and no further action would be taken against him. He even had to attend his wife's funeral when he was still on bail and describes the ordeal as the 'worst two weeks' of his life. Police said there had been no further arrests and there was 'nothing pointing towards anything suspicious,' but they would have to wait until the outcome of the inquest. Mr Edwards told the St Helens Star: 'Every time I look out of the window, I can see the spot where she was found. 'It's devastating. I love her to bits and I'll never, ever stop missing her. She was a lovely person, very kind and giving.'

"Arjen Robben has said he is tired of people criticising him after he admitted diving during Holland's last-16 win against Mexico. The Dutchman appeared to be making a particular effort to stay on his feet during the World Cup quarter-final win against Costa Rica on Saturday, despite being fouled a number of times over the course of the 120 minutes.

"When Alexis Sanchez was preparing to join  Barcelona in 2011, his Udinese team-mate and close pal Antonio Di Natale told him: ‘Go to the Premier League instead, it will suit your style far more’. That advice will have come back to the 25-year-old this summer as Barcelona usher him towards the exit to make way for Luis Suarez. To say Sanchez has failed at the Nou Camp would be wrong: last season only Lionel Messi scored more goals for Barcelona in La Liga and only Diego Costa and Cristiano Ronaldo managed more in the entire division, but he has struggled to fit the Barca mould. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alexis Sanchez freestyling with Chile team-mates . Transfer target: Arsenal and Liverpool are hoping to sign Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona this summer . Goal-getter: The forward has shone for Chile at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . On his way out? He is sought by Liverpool as a replacement to the surely outgoing Luis Suarez . VIDEO Suarez to Barca talks open . Barcelona is the perfectly tailored suit for some players and a straitjacket for others. ‘I had to learn how to play football again. I couldn’t do what I did in Italy,’ he told El Pais last year. Pep Guardiola was a fan because he saw in him someone who could play with his back to goal holding the ball up but who also had the pace to be played in behind a rivals’ defence. But the job demanded sacrifice — no longer could he live up to the Nino Maravilla (Boy Wonder) nickname given to him in Italy as he took Udinese by storm, having arrived from River Plate in 2008, where he won the league under Diego Simeone. At times he struggled against defences that always sit deep against Barcelona, allowing little space behind. ‘Sometimes I want to take people on but because the opposition is defending so deep I can’t and so I have to just play a pass back into midfield,’ he said. There was also less scope for him to dominate and go where he saw fit on the pitch, as he did for  Udinese and for the national team. When he said, ‘I work three times as hard for the Chile team as I do for Barcelona’, he wasn’t revealing a lazy side to his game, he was just illustrating how at the club there was far less freedom for him to move around the pitch. At Liverpool or Arsenal, Brendan Rodgers or Arsene Wenger will be more willing to play to his tune. He will have the lead role that was never possible at Barcelona alongside Messi. Away from the spotlight of one of Europe’s most glamorous club he will also be more comfortable off the pitch. He is famous for being at a publicity shoot in Milan once and failing to notice the club’s chief executive Adriano Galliani at the table of a top city restaurant. The glitz of football’s who’s who tends to pass him by. Youngster: Sanhez was advised to move to the Premier League as a youngster, but chose Barca instead . Star studded: He has struggled to make an impact in a Barcelona team containing Lionel Messi up top . Luis Suarez vs Alexis Sanchez . Forget the claims that he might struggle to adapt in England. Those who know him well from his Serie A days say he is so driven and ambitious that he doesn’t choose a city to live in, instead he chooses a coach to play for. ‘Guardiola made me feel like a Ferrari,’ he said of the Barca coach who left only one season after Sanchez arrived. If a Premier League coach can make him feel special again and can persuade him that he will be go back to being the Sanchez of old – the Alexis of Udinese where he still returns every summer to see old friends, then he will be convinced. And if he joins Arsenal or Liverpool this summer, while he might not drag them single-handedly to within a whisker of the league title scoring 31 goals along the way, he will bring many of the same qualities possessed by Suarez. Main man: Arsene Wenger (left) and Brendan Rodgers (right) would build their teams around the 25-year-old . Jump for joy: His nickname when growing up in Chile was 'squirrel', as he was always climbing trees . His nickname as a boy growing up in Tocopilla in northern Chile was ‘Squirrel’ because he was always climbing trees or scaling buildings to retrieve lost footballs. He has that Suarez hyperactivity on the pitch. It has been suppressed at Barcelona and it needs to be tapped into again. He will run all day for the cause, as one of the most famous stories from his days in Italy demonstrates. He lived near Udinese’s Stadio Friuli outside the city. One day he drove into the centre to go shopping and managed to lose his keys. Instead of asking to be picked up or to be given a lift home he simply ran the four miles home to get a spare set of keys and then ran back to his car. Understand why that seemed the most logical thing for him to do and you begin to understand Sanchez. The speed, skill and agression shown in his third season at Barcelona will mean some supporters are against the sale. He has suitors in Italy where he still has a home. But the Premier League is calling and it seems this time he is about to listen to the advice of his friend Antonio.

"A Texas community is outraged over a newly released video showing and officer calling a pitbull over before shooting the dog to death. The incident happened in August but footage has just now been released by the Cleburne police department. The officer, who has not been identified, claims the pitbull was aggressive and rushing towards him. Scroll down for video . A Texas community is outraged over a newly released video showing and officer calling a pitbull over (not the dog pictured) before shooting the dog to death . CBS DFW reports that the officer was called to Lindsey Lane in response to a 911 call from a woman saying three pits were menacing a car and keeping people from leaving. The loose dogs belonged to neighbor Amanda Henderson. She said the footage showed a murder. 'I see him murdering my puppy, our family...our dog,' she told WFAA. She says that the footage shows no reason to shoot her dog. 'Never once did Max stop wagging his tail. Never once do you hear a growl, an aggressive anything,' she said. Footage shows one pitbull running up to one cop with its tail wagging upon the officer's arrival. Another officer, fitted with a body camera, can be seen going behind the house to find two more dogs in a ditch. Police say the video is not representative of the situation, and that the officer who fired was trying to get the dogs secure until animal control could respond when one animal became a threat . The unidentified officer is heard to make kissing noises at the animals as a gun comes into frame. The officer claims the dog was charging with teeth barred when he opened fire, but in the footage the gun fills most of the frame. Police say the video is not representative of the situation, and that the officer who fired was trying to get the dogs secure until animal control could respond when one animal became a threat. Residents are not comfortable with how he handled the situation. 'To call the dog and act like you’re going to be sweet to the dog, and you just blatantly shoot it, I don’t think that’s right at all,' says neighbor Virginia Granger. Both the pitbull's owners and the 911 caller have since moved out of the neighborhood . Kristin Dodge, who also lives in the area, told CBS DFW the dogs were well behaved and played with her kids. 'These are people’s pets. These are people’s family. To see something like that happen wasn’t really necessary, I think,' she said. Both the pitbull's owners and the 911 caller have since moved out of the neighborhood. Anyone with information about the incident is urged to call police at 817-556-8894.","The officer, who has not been identified, claims the pitbull was aggressive and rushing towards him .

"An extravagant mansion built on the site of Alexander Hamilton's duel with Aaron Burr has been snapped off the market for a cool $6,200,000. The patch of land on New Jersey's Gold Coast played host to one of the most influential moments in US political history. Now, it has been transformed into a marble-paneled monument with panoramic views of New York City's skyline. Majestic: This is a glimpse of the panoramic view of Manhattan from the mansion built on the site where Alexander Hamilton was killed . Idyllic: The new owners can recline among the shrubbery on their private terrace while taking in the buzz of New York City . Historic: The opulent rooms are decked in oak wood, marble and gold, with wrought iron railings outside in neoclassical style . Designed just 12 years ago, it was fashioned in the neoclassical style popular in the early 19th century when Hamilton was fatally shot by his political nemesis. The distinctive Mansard roof and dormer windows pay homage to France’s Second Empire, while the interior boasts the perfect combination of modern luxuries and comfort. The 7,200-square-foot floor plan is divided into four bedrooms, a gym, an extravagant office, and a private terrace with gaping windows looking out over the Hudson River. Guests will be given a regal entry via a majestic foyer, which opens out onto the main salon, dining room, and library. Three marble wood-burning fireplaces are dotted through the living space, and a multi-zone radiant heater has been installed for winter. Pivotal moment: Many say Alexander Hamilton (right) deliberately missed when he and Aaron Burr (center) dueled in 1804 . Vibrant: The gold-lined property with handing chandeliers is a tribute to Hamilton, one of the shining stars in America's political history . A casual dinner: The new owners will enjoy their evening meal on this mezzanine floor with a gaping view of the Hudson River . Budding chefs? Perhaps the buyer has a penchant for home cooking as their $6,200,000 has bagged them a deluxe kitchen . Master: One of the three marble wood-burning fireplaces is set in this master bedroom. There are two other master suites in the home . Luxurious details also include a private elevator, surround sound, and two garages. Hopefully the new owner has a taste for cooking and will no doubt be delighted by the gourmet chef's kitchen, butler's pantry and grilling patio. The three master suites feature marble baths, high ceilings and vast closet space. A fourth bedroom could also double up as a game room. And it is just minutes from Manhattan via the NY Waterway Ferry, NJ Transit or Lincoln Tunnel. Regal: Built 12 years ago, the home was designed to echo the extravagant early 1800s, with modern touches such as surround sound . Modern touch: This living area with 1960s style furniture maintains the golden theme and has french windows leading out to the terrace . Playing around: With a pool table and gym equipment, there is plenty in the way of activities for an energetic homeowner . The dazzling property in New Jersey's King's Bluff area is something of a tribute to Hamilton, one of the stars of America's political history. Decades younger than Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, Hamilton was an intellectual wonder child. His rise to political glory, as America's first Secretary to the Treasury, was rapid and his word was highly influential. When voters cottoned on to his distaste for Vice President Burr, they were quick to back him. Relax: If the homeowner tires of gazing at the stars or the skyline through that gold telescope, they can flop on this plush velvet couch . Spell-binding: At night, the bright white house which is lined with trimmed rows of hedges and potted plants, gleams . But in 1804, he made another dig at Burr who was running for New York governor. And by that point, Burr had had enough. As per the times, he challenged Hamilton to the duel that would kill him. Many say Hamilton deliberately missed Burr when they drew shotguns. But Burr's struck Hamilton and he died the next day. In the decades since, Hamilton Avenue, as it is now called, has played host to numerous re-enactments and people from all over the United States travel to pay homage to the revered politician at King's Bluff. It was on the market with Douglas Elliman for an asking price of $7,500,000.","The four-bedroom home with gym, private elevator, private terrace, and two garages overlooks Manhattan skyline .

"The 48-year-old woman was sentenced to seven years in jail for physically, sexually and emotionally tormenting her 15-year-old nephew for five months . A 48-year-old woman has been sentenced to seven years in jail for torturing her nephew for five months while he was under her care. The Brisbane District Court heard how she subjected the 15-year-old to 'subhuman' punishments that turned his life into a 'living hell' and left him with psychological trauma after he was left in her care following abuse from his own mother. These punishments included force-feeding him chillies and laxatives before refusing to let him into the bathroom to clean himself during his stay at her farm in Brisbane's north, according to the Courier Mail. On another occasion, he was made to consume a large number of worming tablets as well as castor oil before being forced to attend school without being allowed to clean himself up. More examples of humiliation were revealed in the courtroom including instances where the teenager was forced to shave his genitals and, on a separate occasion, filmed while being forced to penetrate himself with a sex toy by both his aunt and her daughter who was aged in her 20s. The women threatened to release the footage publicly if the boy told anyone of the abuse he was suffering. Instances of physical abuse, including punching the teens face, using a stock whip on him and using pliers to squeeze his fingers, were also listed. The boy was warned not to inform anyone of the torture or else a 'bikie friend' would find and kill him, however police were eventually notified in mid-2012. 'It suggests a fundamental personality dysfunction with a deeply rooted capacity to cause serious harm,' Judge Leanne Clare said of the aunt's behaviour. The judge at  Brisbane's District Court ruled that there was 'focus, deliberation and sadism' in her actions . The woman's defence representative told the court that she suffered from depression, anxiety and possible post-traumatic stress disorder from a history of abuse and loss. He also reinstating the woman's claims that her nephew was difficult to deal with, however Judge Clare rejected the claims. The 48-year-old pleaded guilty to her charges in February, but the Courier Mail revealed that she had previously intended to call in her victim for cross-examination. 'The repeated infliction of intense pain and suffering was a drawn-out course of conduct. It was not so much a lack of control of passing anger, there was focus, deliberation and sadism in what you did,' Judge Clare said during the sentencing. 'There was the sexual humiliation. It was committed against a record for significant violence. Those features in my view make this an appropriate case for the postponement of parole eligibility.' The boy's female cousin was also given a two year jail term.

"A British climber miraculously escaped death twice after being pummelled with rocks 'the size of cars' while ice climbing in New Zealand. Krystle Morley, 28, had just completed her lifetime ambition of ice climbing in New Zealand when rocks began to hurtle down the glacier towards her as she waited to be rescued by helicopter. The climbers ran to take cover at the edge of a helipad but, just minutes after the rocks stopped flying over their heads, a second fall was triggered. After completing an ice climb in New Zealand, 28-year-old Krystle Morley found herself faced with death during not one - but two - rockfalls on the Franz Joseph Glacier (pictured) Krystle, from Sheffield, miraculously escaped with just a small bump on her head. She described her brush with death: 'I heard this massive thunderclap. I turned round and I saw a mass of cloud and rocks and noticed our guide's face had gone from normal to sheer panic as the rocks started to hurl towards us.' 'I had my hands over my head to protect it because even the smaller rocks could've wiped me out.' 'Boulders the size of cars and fridges were flying past us, and one the size of a microwave seemed to skim past my head.' 'We were hunkered down for what seemed like forever and I was just thinking, ""Any minute now, we're going to get crushed.""' 'Boulders the size of cars and fridges were flying past us, and one the size of a microwave seemed to skim past my head,' Krystle remembers of the experience . The West Yorkshire native was backpacking around New Zealand and on that day, the group had spent the day scaling Franz Joseph Glacier in South Island. The Sheffield Hallam University environmental sciences student said she was 'buzzing' after surviving the first rockfall. But the second struck as the climbers were waiting to board the helicopter - forcing it to take off without them. 'I was thinking, ""I've just cheated death!,"" and not many people can say that - so I was buzzing.' 'When the second rockfall happened my sense of humour failed - I just wanted to get off the ice.' 'I just thought, ""Get me out of here"" - whereas before I was thinking, ""Yes, I'm alive."".' Sheffield native Krystle Morley's lifetime ambition was to try ice climbing in New Zealand . After the second rockfall the group was able to make it safely back to base, but Krystle suffered from severe paranoia for several days and returned home to Sheffield early. She still climbs, and has chosen to learn more about natural hazards as part of her course. She says the experience has given her a new perspective on life. 'I'd cheated death twice and was convinced it was coming for me but it is an awesome story,' she said. 'It's made me a lot stronger and more determined to not shy away from something just because I'm nervous or I don't like it.'","Krystle Morley survived brush with death on the Franz Joseph Glacier .

"A Chicago CEO twice shot by a 'despondent' executive following a demotion has died in hospital, two months after the attack, his family announced this week. ArrowStream's ex-chief technology officer Anthony DeFrances shot company chief Steven LaVoie, 54, in the head and stomach before turning the gun on himself about 9.50am on July 31. Jody LaVoie, the victim's wife, wrote on the website CaringBridge.org. that her husband had 'succumbed to his numerous injuries'. 'I had truly hoped to tell a different story now about his recovery, and for so long I believed he would be with us again,' the post said, according to The Chicago Sun-Times. Scroll down for video . Shooting: ArrowStream CEO Steven LaVoi (left) has succumbed to his injuries and died in hospital after he was twice shot chief technology officer Anthony DeFrances, 59 (right) in the company's Chicago office on July 31 . Hospitalized: ArrowStream CEO Steven LaVoie, 54, was 'gravely wounded' after being shot in the stomach and head by a 'disgruntled employee'. He has now died . Scene: Police said one person was killed and another injured in a shooting at a Bank of America building in Chicago's financial district on Thursday morning . 'But know that the man you all remember so dearly, fought so bravely. 'Steve brought great dignity and beauty to all of our lives these past months.' LaVoie, a father of three daughters, survived and was rushed to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in an 'extremely critical condition'. DeFrances, who joined the company when it was created in 2000, died at the scene. He was 59. The shooting occurred in the tech logistics company's office on the 17th floor of the Bank of America building on LaSalle Street in Chicago's busy Loop business district. Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy told CBS Chicago at the time that DeFrances, also a married father-of-three, was told a few days earlier he was being demoted as the company downsized. McCarthy said DeFrances was 'despondent over the fact that he got demoted', went into work this morning and demanded a one-on-one meeting with LaVoie. During the meeting, the Tower Lakes man allegedly pulled out a gun. Scene: The shooting occurred on the 17th floor of the Bank of America building on LaSalle Street in Chicago's Loop business district . As the two men struggled for the firearm, LaVoie was shot in the head and stomach with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun, which was recovered at the scene. The gunman had a Master of Science in Experimental Psychology and a Masters of Computer Science from the University of Dayton. DeFrances had worked at ArrowStream since 2000, when it was founded by LaVoie. The logistics company, which provides support to fast food restaurants, was this year named as one of Chicago’s 'best and brightest' companies to work for. According to his profile on the Junior State of America website, LaVoie completed a Masters in public and private management at the Yale School of Management after gaining a Bachelor of Arts from The University of California, Berkeley. Scene: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents and Chicago police were called to the Bank of America building in Chicago's financial district on Thursday .

He served on the Board of the Chicago Institute of Psychoanalysis and chaired its investment committee. Chicago Tribune reported LaVoie and DeFrances were friends as well as co-workers. DeFrances's neighbors in Tower Lakes described him as polite and a loving father to his adult children - two sons and a daughter.","ArrowStream CTO Anthony DeFrances, 59, was 'despondent' following his demotion after 14 years with the company .

"CLICK HERE FOR ALL THE STATS AND FACTS FROM THE QUARTER-FINAL USING OUR MATCH ZONE SERVICE . At the end the National Stadium in Brasilia resounded with the sounds of the 20,000 Argentine fans goading their hosts with a chant to the tune of Bad Moon Rising as they waved their shirts above their head. It is an involved song, explaining how the Brazilians have been crying ever since Claudio Caniggia scored against them in 1990 and how Diego Maradona is better than Pele. ‘How does it feel?’ they sang ‘to be bossed about in your own backyard.’ It has become the anthem of this World Cup, heard everywhere Argentines gather, which is pretty much everywhere.

And it feels particularly appropriate . at the moment. Argentina have a rag-tag army of fans, sleeping in cars . and colonising cities and stadia as they journey around this country. But . they are led by the World Cup’s last superstar, Leo Messi, and they . look increasingly as though they are heading for the Maracana next . Sunday afternoon. Brazil might meet them there, but they are shorn of . Neymar and an awful realisation is dawning on the hosts: a new nightmare . of the Maracana might be looming, with Argentina beating them in their . very own final. And that would surely be worse than their original nightmare, the Maracanazo, when Uruguay beat them to win the 1950 World Cup . Messi . undid Belgium with an inspired first-half performance on Saturday, the . best Argentina have produced so far at this World Cup, with excellent . supporting roles from Gonzalo Higuain and Lucas Biglia, whose . introduction brought better balance to the team. On the debit side, they . may miss Angel Di Maria, who limped off with a thigh injury after 33 . minutes, for the semi final. It . was not an overwhelming performance. Belgium, whilst more direct and . physical than inspirational, never allowed them the comfort of running . away with the game and right to the end when Romelu Lukaku drove in a . cross and Axel Witsel shot over, they made it a nervous affair. Nearly two: Lionel Messi was so close to doubling Argentina's lead with a free-kick in the first half . Painful: Kevin de Bruyne goes down injured in front of Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella . Protection, referee? Lionel Messi pleads for a foul on the ground during the quarter-final . Scuffle: The Italian referee has a word with Kompany over an on-pitch incident . Yet . Argentina are in their first World Cup semi-final since 1990 and coming . into form. Principally, one man increasingly looks ready to make this . World Cup his own. ‘Messi . played a wonderful match,’ said his coach Alex Sabella.  ‘Every move he . makes is a sign of hope for us and endangers his opponents, which is . what he does beyond scoring goals or not. 'The . influence he has is decisive; the fact that he never loses the ball and . always brings two or three opponents to him. He is water in the desert. He gives us that. Today when the terrain was dry he gave us that breath . of fresh air.’ Marc . Wilmots, the Belgium coach, was not in no mood to join any potential . coronation, however. ‘We were not impressed by the Argentina, absolutely . not,’ he said.  ‘They’re just an ordinary team. If I had played this . way I would have been destroyed by Belgian press.’ Unlucky: Higuain nearly doubled his advantage in the second half, but he hit the bar . Stunned: And his coach Sabella fell to the ground after the incident . Celebration: The Argentina fans, who had thousands of supporters in Brazil, cheer with their fans . He . was right to point out that as the game wore on, Argentina retreated . and created little, a last-minute chance for Messi aside when Courtois . saved well. ‘They suffered and if we had equalised they were dead and . buried,’ said Wilmots. But in reality, Argentina should have had the . game won by early in the second half. Wilmots . did concede that Messi was an ‘extraordinary’ player whilst also . complaining he was offered too much protection from the referee. In . truth, it was his first-half performance that decided the fate of this . game. There was a moment on . 28 minutes when Messi picked up the ball in his own half and spotted a . way through a forest of midfielders and managed to cut the ball inside . Vincent Kompany a full 45 yards away and find Angel Di Maria. As it . happened, Kompany recovered brilliantly to block the shot but you had to . pity the Manchester City captain. The angle accuracy of the pass was simply beyond that you would imagine was possible on a football pitch. Jubilation: The South Americans fall to the ground after securing the 1-0 victory . Agonising: Kompany had a tough day against Argentina's strikers . Guidance: Messi prays ahead of the crucial game in Brasilia on Saturday . Tough: Marouane Fellaini and Daniel van Buyten try to tackle Higuain . At . times in that first half Messi seemed almost to be goading the Belgians . into tackling him, lingering on the ball and turning away at the last . moment. The match was only eight minutes old when he made his impact, . turning away from one challenge only to find Marouane Fellaini pressing . him. Shielding the ball, he simply turned in the opposite direction and . played in Di Maria. The . winger’s cross deflected off a defender and sat up nicely on the half . volley for Higuain, who has endured a torrent of criticism in his home . country for his performances thus far. This time though he connected . beautifully, sweeping it into the far corner from 20 yards out. But . Belgium edged their way back into the game. Kevin De Bruyne’s powerful . strike was parried away by Sergio Romero and Kevin Mirallas headed just . wide from an excellent Jan Vertonghen cross on 52 minutes Higuain . unleashed a shot which was deflected wide by Daniel van Buyten while . Hazard was lucky to stay on the pitch when he raised his studs on to the . shin of Biglia on 53 minutes. Argentina . had a chance to take complete control of the game on 55 minutes. Higuain pushed the ball through the legs of Kompany to create a clear . strike on goal but lifted his shot over Courtois and on to the bar. Wilmots brought on Romelu Lukaku for Divock Origi and eventually took of . the disappointing Hazard, opting to send long balls towards Lukaku, . Fellaini and Van Buyten. They . worried Argentina in their best moments, but the South Americans never . looked out of control. Finally they are past he quarter finals, a stage . they could never seem to get beyond. Having done so, perhaps they will . be freed to deliver the trophy they crave.","Higuain nets early opener in Brasilia, volleying past Thibaut Courtois .

"An Alabama Baptist minister who confessed to having sex with married church members and neglecting to tell them he had AIDS was temporarily banned Thursday from acting as pastor. Montgomery County Circuit Judge Charles Price issued a preliminary injunction, as sought by deacons and trustees of Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church. Price ruled that the Rev. Juan McFarland, 47, must turn in his church keys and his church-provided Mercedes and then stay away from the church he led for 24 years. Church members hugged and prayed after the ruling. 'Now we've got the church back, and the healing can begin,' said Lois Caffey, a member for 21 years. Scroll down for video . Scandal: Rev. Juan McFarland is seen in court on Tuesday. He reportedly confessed to having sex with married church members and neglecting to tell them he had AIDS . Temporarily banned: After the court ruling, McFarland returned to the church, met with leaders in a private session, then he turned in his keys and left at 4:05 p.m. — less than an hour ahead of the judge's deadline . Parishioners: Church members, James Long, left, and Lee Sanford, right, speak to the media in front of the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church on Thursday . After the court ruling, McFarland returned to the church, met with leaders in a private session they described as tense. Then he turned in his keys and left at 4:05 p.m. — less than an hour ahead of the judge's deadline. The judge scheduled a hearing Dec. 1 to decide whether to issue a permanent ban against McFarland. The preacher confessed to his affairs, his AIDS diagnosis and said that he had been abusing drugs in a series of sermons that stunned church-goers. A parishioner told WSFA last week after the news broke 'Who does this to people, and you are the leader? Who does this? 'I know a young lady who is a member of the church who says she has slept with him and that she didn't want this to go public, and she running out now trying to find out if there is anything wrong with her. 'And my heart goes out to her because she's been a wonderful church member, and then for something like this to happen. The fact that he didn't tell them at all. That's a crime in itself. 'And I'm hoping by doing this interview that she will see that she can come and talk to someone and her name or whatever will not be revealed. And maybe she can have some peace by coming forward and not the shame that goes along with it.' A different parishioner told WSFA 'I believe that he should be put on trial. Go to court and let the judge decide if he should go to jail or not. We tend to sweep things under the rug, especially if they're the leader. It's like oh, no, please let's not get this out but I think after this that they will have more discussions on HIV and AIDS.' Board of trustees chairman Lee Sanford said the challenge now is to reunite the 170 active members of the congregation. 'I'm confident with God's help we will be able to do that,' he said. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit said the congregation voted to fire McFarland after his confessions but that he refused to leave and changed the church's locks and control of church bank accounts. McFarland said nothing inside or outside the courtroom Thursday during two hearings. He attended without an attorney. He also said nothing as he left the church carrying only a ball cap containing a few personal items. Attorney Kenneth Shinbaum, top right, addresses a court hearing. Members have filed suit trying to oust Rev. Juan McFarland, who they say admitted to adultery, drug use and other transgressions from the pulpit . The boards of deacons and trustees sued McFarland after he preached on Oct. 12 despite the vote to fire him a week earlier. One of the plaintiffs, Deacon Nathan Williams Jr., said church leaders had no suspicions about McFarland until he delivered sermons in in August and September, during which he confessed to having sex with church members in the church building, but not in the sanctuary; having AIDS but not telling sex partners; and using illegal drugs. Williams and Sanford said McFarland told the congregation that God directed him to make a public confession. Williams said that the congregation first tried to help the pastor but that when it didn't work, members took a vote during a service Oct. 5 to fire him. He said some were upset that McFarland tried to fire several longtime church officials and others were concerned about taking communion from the ill minister or having him around their children. Williams told The Montgomery Advertiser last week 'He was on marijuana, cocaine and all the drugs you can think of. Those are his words.' Parliamentarian Marc Anthoni Peacock testified that the vote Oct. 5 wasn't officially part of the Sunday service and he described it as 'holy hell.' Peacock was originally a defendant in the lawsuit but resigned from the church Thursday and was dropped from the litigation. WFSA reported that prior to that, 'Peacock was being sued for his alleged role in helping McFarland change the church's locks, bank accounts and for threatening to shoot deacons if they returned to the church's property.' Price said the courts have no role in religious matters, but they sometimes have to step in when congregations can't settle their differences over control of buildings and money. 'If it could be resolved in the church, it would have been already,' the judge told the courtroom packed, with more than 100 people. Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church is 95 years old and is part of the National Baptist Convention. Church members on both sides of the pastoral dispute said the convention gives churches autonomy in personnel decisions. Not alone: A supporter, left, leads Reve.

"A canoeist managed to paddle to safety after being attacked by a 6ft shark that knocked her into the water off the coast of California. The woman, who has not been named, told authorities that she was paddling her outrigger canoe about about three miles north of Santa Barbara Harbor, when a shark began biting her boat. She was thrown into the sea during the attack, the local harbor patrol said, but the woman managed to scramble back into her canoe and paddle it back to shore as the shark swam away. The woman was pitched into the water during the attack by a 6ft long blue-gray shark (file picture) The canoeist described the shark as six feet  long and blue-gray in color. Earlier this month, a surfer was attacked by a shark on the central California coast, prompting the closure of three public beaches in the area controlled by Vandenberg Air Force Base. The attack occurred around 30 miles north of Santa Barbara, according to a report by the Shark Research Committee. The surfer suffered lacerations to his knee, and his surfboard was scraped in the attack by a shark measuring 8 to 10 feet in length. California's last fatal shark attack was in 2012. At the time three beaches were closed for 72 hours . Vandenberg Air Force Base closed Surf, Wall and Minuteman beaches following the attack but they were reopened 72 hours later. The report did not specify the type of shark involved but local media described it as a Great White. Despite intense media attention generated by shark attacks on humans, such incidents are fairly rare along the U.S. Pacific Coast. There were 39 reported shark attacks in California from 2001 to 2013 - or 3.25 per year - and five of them resulted in fatalities, according to data tracked by the Florida Museum of Natural History. The data shows East Coast swimmers are much more likely to wind up the victims of a shark attack, the Los Angeles Times reported. Ralph Collier, president of the Shark Research Institute, told the newspaper that a person is more likely to die by being struck by a falling coconut than being attacked by a shark. He said officials have logged 50 to 100 shark attacks per year worldwide since record-keeping began. Of those attacks, only eight to 12 have been fatal. But with more beachgoers heading to the shore and seals and sea lions - a main food source - on the rise in California, the chances of a shark encounter have jumped, Mr Collier added. California's last fatal shark attack was in 2012, when a 16-ft great white mauled Francisco Javier Solorio Jr. in front of his friend while he was surfing near Lompoc. The 39-year-old suffered a severe wound to his torso and died shortly after. Two years earlier, in 2010, another shark attack killed a 19-year-old college student off the same beach at Vandenberg. Lucas McKaine Ransom  was Boogie Boarding with a friend when he was bitten in the leg by a shark described as being 14 to 20 feet long.

"Every four years the warning sounds: Do not buy players on the back of a good World Cup. Every four years, however, such caution is duly ignored. And why not? After all, these are players who have seized the chance to showcase their merits on the biggest stage of all. This weekend - at the business end of the competition - will be no different. Skill school: Colombia's midfielder James Rodriguez has been one of the stars of the World Cup . It is the proverbial 'shop window' and there are no shortage of cash-laden customers peering through its glass. We have already seen players such as Colombia's James Rodriguez catapult their star into another galaxy. But there are countless others jostling for position in the shop front. Here, Sportsmail runs you through those for whom this weekend's quarter-finals mean more than simply winning a place in the last four. Belgium (v Argentina, 5pm, Saturday) Divock Origi (Lille) - £10m . No teenager has made a bigger impression on these finals and, having come from the bench in each of the group games - scoring the winner against Russia - the 19-year-old deservedly won a start for the last-16 tie with USA. Again he used his pace, power and raw enthusiasm to unsettle his minders and was unlucky not to add to his tournament tally. He has outshone Romelu Lukaku and, given his team-mate's reputation on these shores, it is little surprise to see Premier League clubs declaring an interest. Liverpool are chief among them, although a loan deal back to Lille is thought to be one of the conditions of a move. Teenage kicks: Lille's Divock Origi has proved to be a star for Belgium . Colombia (v Brazil, 9pm, Friday) David Ospina (Nice) - FREE . The agile Ospina has conceded just twice in Brazil and will again have to be at his best to deny the hosts on Friday. After six years in Ligue 1 with Nice - he signed for them when he was 19 - he will move on this summer and Arsenal are said to be interested. After this tournament, though, Ospina deserves to be more than just a back-up to Wojciech Szczesny. Top of the stoppers: Colombia's goalkeeper David Ospina has conceded just twice at the World Cup . Jackson Martinez (Porto) - £35m . The 27-year-old has already said he would jump at the chance of a move to Arsenal and, with Arsene Wenger reportedly willing to pay his £35m buyout clause, the striker could well end up in the Premier League. He scored twice in the 4-0 demolition of Japan in the group stage and his athleticism and eye for goal - he has 60 goals in 91 games for Porto - make him one of Europe's most sought-after stars. Premier League bound? Jackson Martinez has a £35m buy-out clause in his contract with Porto . Juan Cuadrado (Fiorentina) - £30m . Fiorentina aren't daft; after the winger's impressive entrance to Brazil 2014 they moved swiftly to acquire full ownership from Udinese. Since then his worth has amplified every time he has taken to the field. The 26-year-old couples flair with fight and a willingness to put a shift in for his side. Indeed, no wideman ran further in Serie A last season. But Cuadrado is more than just a marathon man, as his four assists and one goal at the finals testify. Manchester United and Barcelona have taken note. On the rise: Juan Guillermo Cuadrado has helped Colombia make the quarter finals . Costa Rica (v Holland, 9pm, Saturday) Keylor Navas (Levante) - £8m . The goalkeeper has undoubtedly been one of the surprise stars of the tournament, just as he was in La Liga last season. The 27-year-old has conceded just twice and was decisive in the penalty-shootout victory over Greece. Levante are demanding that Atletico Madrid pay the £8m buyout clause in his contract but others are said to be circling. No way past: Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas makes a save in a penalty shoot out against Greece . Celso Borges (AIK Solna) - £2m . The midfielder has been key to Costa Rica's journey to the last eight, a player who marries his craft to graft and is said to be the 'lungs' of this enterprising side. His residence in the Swedish league remains something of a surprise but that is likely to change after the finals, especially given that he is still just 26 years old. Getting stuck in: Ioannis Maniatis makes a challenge for Costa Rica against Greece . France (v Germany, 5pm, Friday) Antoine Griezmann (Real Sociedad) - £25m . We've been aware of the talented left-winger for a while given his reputation when rising through the youth ranks - he also broke into the Sociedad side at 18 - but only now is his star coming to the fore on the international stage. He has thrilled at these finals with his pace and trickery, and that comes on the back of a 16-goal campaign in La Liga. At 23 years old Sociedad are aware of his market value and it will take an offer north of £20m before they even entertain discussions. Rising up: France forward Antoine Griezmann could command a fee of around £20m should Real Sociedad decide to cash in . VIDEO Team Profile: France highlights . Germany (v France, 5pm, Friday) Toni Kroos (Bayern Munich) - £25m . The 24-year-old playmaker is reluctant to commit his future to Bayern - his contract expires next summer - and Manchester United are ready to pounce. Another commanding display against France, however, may well alert some of the other European big boys and a battle for his signature could ensue. Real Madrid are already among his admirers. Wanted man: Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos is being watched by a number of top clubs . Holland (v Costa Rica, 9pm, Saturday) Daley Blind (Ajax) - £10m . The son of Ajax legend, Danny, immediately caught the eye with two assists in the 5-1 win against Spain. Since then he has looked solid in defence and bright in attack, sparking talk of Louis van Gaal taking him to Manchester United. At 24, time is on his side and a more illustrious setting then the Eredivise surely awaits, although the Dutch champions will demand a fee of at least £10m. Getting stuck in: Daley Blind played a key role in Holland's win over Spain in the opening game . Bruno Martins Indi (Feyenoord) - £7m . The 21-year-old defender has enjoyed a rapid rise through the ranks at both club and international level. He is equally adept at centre-back or covering at left-back and, given his tender years, a big-money move could well be in the offing. Like team-mate Blind he has been linked with United but FC Porto are also weighing up a £7m bid.

Thanks: Shaw throws a boot into the crowd after England drew 0-0 with Costa Rica at the World Cup . The proposed move comes after United legend Paul Scholes warned £34million for Shaw would be too much. Scholes thinks that kind of money could be better spent on a striker who would guarantee van Gaal at least 30 goals a season. 'The proposed £34m transfer for the 18-year-old Luke Shaw to Manchester United is another example of something which has a bad long-term impact,' he said. 'Clubs are priced out of this market which is why they go abroad for cheap options - they’re not better players. 'For a left-back to be worth £34m shows how silly the game has gone. For that money I want a centre-forward who’s going to score 30 goals a season.' Shaw, who turns 19 in July, already has 60 appearances in the Premier League and three England caps to his name.

"It's been 30 years since Peter Venkman, Raymond Stanz and Egon Spengler took on the ghosts of Manhattan in Ivan Reitman's Ghostbusters film. But historical records have revealed a trio of ghoul-hunting scientists were leading the way when it came to investigating the supernatural. London-based Findmypast.co.uk discovered the first ever attempts to study and so-called ‘apparitional experiences’ began with Edmund Gurney, Frederic Myers and Frank Podmore. Historical records, found by London-based Findmypast.co.uk discovered the first ever attempts to study ghosts began with Edmund Gurney, Frederic Myers (pictured left) and Frank Podmore (right). The three men were said to be leading figures in the early years of the Society for Psychical Research . The three men were said to be leading figures in the early years of the Society for Psychical Research, and worked on the committee for Apparitions and Haunted Houses to provide evidence for human survival after death. Their work was widely publicised by newspaper editor, of the Pall Mall Gazette, and believer and active commenter on spiritualism, William Thomas Stead. In 1888 Mr Frederic Myers, then secretary of the Society for Psychical Research, called for a census of ghosts. He asked the public to report if they or their neighbours had seen or felt supernatural presences. People were asked to answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to questions such as: ‘Have you ever, when in good health and completely awake, had a distinct impression of seeing or being touched by a human being, or of hearing a voice or sound which suggested a human presence when no one was there?’ Another question was: ‘Can you recall that you have ever, in the course of the last ten years, when in good health, had a dream of the death of some person known to you (about whom you were not anxious at the time), which dream you marked as an exceptionally vivid one, and of which the distressing impression lasted for as long as an hour after you rose in the morning?’ The results were published by newspaper editor, of the Pall Mall Gazette, and believer and active commenter on spiritualism, William Thomas Stead in 1894. He concluded that ‘of the thousand million persons now living on the planet, there would be, if they all lived to maturity, at least ten million who will see and recognise in the course of their lives realistic apparitions of dead persons’. This census, carried out between 1889 and 1892 also revealed that women were more susceptible to the supernatural, with 12 per cent of the women surveyed reporting seeing a ghost compared to 9 per cent of men. Many of the original ‘ghostbusters’ theories and investigations involved séances, deathbed wraiths, hauntings, apparitions and mediums. Their work began in 1882, when the Society for Psychical Research was founded. Mr Gurney, Mr Myers and Mr Podmore teamed up to research the possibility of existence after death.

And later, in 1933, an article appeared in the Litchfield Mercury calling for a new ghost census. Mr Stead, Mr Gurney and Mr Podmore all met untimely deaths under what some described as mysterious circumstances. Mr Stead died on board the Titanic, after previously predicting he would die from either lynching or drowning. This year is the 30th anniversary of Ivan Reitman's Ghostbusters film starring Bill Murray (left), Harold Ramis (centre) and Dan Akroyd (right) as Dr. Peter Venkman, Dr. Egon Spengler and Dr. Raymond Stanz respectively.

He asked the public to report if they  had seen or felt supernatural presences.

Mr Gurney died from the effects of an unexplained overdose of chloroform and a verdict of accidental death was recorded, while Mr Podmore drowned. Reports state that neither Mr Podmore's brother, his wife nor any member of the Society for Psychical Research attended his funeral, but there absence was not explained. Findmypast.co.uk also discovered a collection of other tales of ghosts, death and terror in newspaper archives. For example, an 1897 article detailed a haunted London taxi. It explained that on a ‘dreary night’, a taxi driver picked up a man who was on the run from ‘invisible enemies’. After driving his vehicle away, the driver said the man had committed suicide in the back of his taxi. Findmypast.co.uk also discovered a collection of other tales of ghosts in newspaper archives.

"Chay Lancaster, who died in a walking accident four years ago in the Lake District . The body of a keen hiker lay undiscovered for almost four years after he was killed in a walking accident. Chay Lancaster, 41, died following an accidental fall in a remote part of the Lake District in September 2010. Despite a string of extensive searches after he went missing, his body remained unfound until July this year. Mr Lancaster, of Blackpool, Lancashire, had to be identified from his dental records. An inquest at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria heard that because of the long delay a pathologist could not give a cause of death. Mr Lancaster's mother, Judith Lancaster, told the court her son regularly walked the fells on his own. 'We always told him he should tell us where he was going, but he never did, saying nothing will happen to me, walking,' she added. The family only found out where Mr Lancaster had gone when he went missing as his daughter Elizabeth, who was away at Edinburgh University, returned and looked through his collection of maps and discovered it was one of Little Langdale that had gone missing. The police began making inquiries on September 23 but, despite Cumbria Police, Lancashire Police, Ambleside and Langdale Mountain Rescue team and search dogs becoming involved, no body was found. PC Jo Dyson told the inquest that mountain rescue teams made regular searches and always kept Mr Lancaster's disappearance in mind when out on the fells. The Tarns on Blake Rigg in the Lake District, Cumbria, around where Mr Lancaster died . It was not until July 28 this year that climbers came across human remains at the bottom of the 535m-high Blake Rigg crags, near Blea Tarn, on the other side of Little Langdale. It was a remote corner of the fells that not many people walked, PC Dyson said. A juniper bush was found broken and a rucksack containing Mr Lancaster's property was stuck on a branch. 'Ten metres below that a shoe was found and 20 metres below that were the remains of Mr Lancaster,' PC Dyson added. Mr Lancaster's body lay undiscovered for four years before finally being found in July . Mrs Lancaster said her son had a history of heart problems. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Ian Smith said: 'Mr Lancaster was off for a day's fell walking. He was not in any trouble. He wasn't trying to lose himself. 'It is impossible to say where he was. He either had a heart attack while on a strenuous walk and consequently fell, or he could just have lost his footing and fell. 'There was a large skull fracture, which the pathologist said could explain his death or have happened after death. 'But on the balance of probabilities, the most likely explanation was simply an accident. Mr Lancaster had lost his footing at a certain point and fell a long way and died outright.' After the inquest, Mrs Lancaster said: 'He loved fell walking and if he had to die anywhere, it was an appropriate place for it to happen.'","Chay Lancaster, 41, died while walking in Cumbria in September 2010 .

"Kimi Raikkonen sustained an incredible 47G impact during his opening-lap shunt at the British Grand Prix. The Finn was immediately taken to the on-track medical centre after he lost control of his Ferrari on the exit of Turn 5 before smashing into the barrier on the Wellington Straight as he attempted to re-join the track.

Miraculously, Raikkonen sustained only bruises to his knees and ankles in the accident, but is now a doubt for this week's two-day test at Silverstone. Ferrari are however confident that Raikkonen, who revealed earlier this week that he is likely to retire from Formula One when his contract expires at the end of next season, will be fit for the German Grand Prix in a fortnight's time.

'Unfortunately, my race today ended on the first lap, after I had managed to get away well, making up enough ground to be fighting for eleventh place,' said Raikkonen, who started in 18th after a miserable qualifying session. 'At turn 5, I went off the track and while trying to get back on, I must have hit a kerb. I then lost control of the car and ended in the barriers. 'I am really very disappointed with how things went today, but now I want to put this incident behind me and just concentrate on the next race in Germany.' Ferrari team principal Marco Mattiacci added: 'The most important news right now is that Kimi is alright, even though the impact with the barriers was a heavy one.

United are determined to add one more midfielder to their squad this summer following the capture of Ander Herrera, with Van Gaal feeling that his new side requires bite and steel in the central acres to complement the composure of players such as Michael Carrick and Tom Cleverley.

United have also been put off by Juventus' asking price for Frenchman Paul Pogba, with the former United academy star commanding a fee in the region of £55m this summer. Van Gaal has been impressed by former Manchester City star De Jong's dynamic and disciplined showings at the World Cup for Holland and he is seen as a pragmatic fit with Premier League experience. The 29-year-old would be available for around £9m and he could emerge as an alternative if United are unable to land Vidal.

"For many people a day out in the sunshine is not complete without a visit to an ice cream van, but unfortunately sometimes a 99 can prove disappointing and messy. However, in a bid to cure people of Flake 'angle-angst' - which, apparently, is rife - a scientist claims to have cracked the formula for the perfect 99 ice cream. His research found the recipe . for a successful 99 means a flake should sit at precisely 45 degrees, have 35 . per cent 'chocolate crumbliness' and the ice cream should be chilled to minus 15°C. A scientist (not pictured) claims to have cracked the formula for the perfect 99 ice cream. The research commissioned by Cadbury found the perfect recipe for a successful 99 means a flake sitting at precisely 45 degrees, 35 per cent chocolate crumbliness and ice cream chilled to minus 15 . The study is said to have come about after Cadbury, which makes the flakes for the ice creams, received phone calls from seriously concerned 99 lovers who were worried about the angle the flake was served at in their cone. The company sought out an expert to come up with the ideal way in which the ice cream should be constructed, which will be shared with the Ice Cream Alliance - the UK trade association for ice cream manufacturers and retailers - which might mean customers will be more satisfied with their 99s in future. 68 per cent of people consider the flake is the most crucial part and just over half insist the chocolate must sit at a 45 degree angle, the study said . Simon Moore, a professor at London Metropolitan University questioned 1000 Britons over the iconic ice cream. He found 68 per cent of enthusiasts consider the flake is the most crucial part - as they like to use it as a spoon - and just over half insist the chocolate must sit at a 45 degree angle. Around 55 per cent of people polled claim to suffer 'angle-angst', while 18 per cent are worried they will be poked in the eye if the flake is at any angle other than vertical. Around 55 per cent of people . deliberately eat that flake first while 28 per cent find the ice cream . tastier with the chocolate in it. More . than half of people believe the perfect ratio for the amount of solid . chocolate to crumbliness is between 35 and 50 per cent. The optimum temperature was decided by Piccadilly Whip, one of London’s biggest ice cream fleets.

"A man who killed his cousin days after he became a father to a baby daughter was today jailed for 32 years. John ‘Boy’ Ward had 21-year-old Thomas Ward shot on the doorstep of his caravan in front of his wife and five-day-old daughter in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, by three masked men in an act of revenge. He told his relative he would deliberately choose the moment he was at his happiest to kill him over a long-standing family feud, which started before Thomas Ward was even born. Thomas Ward, 21, (left) was shot at a caravan site in Stevenage by John 'Boy' Ward (right) over a family feud . The court heard the Ward family had been torn apart after the death of John’s brother Mickey following a car crash in 1987. Thomas’ father, James ‘Young Fox’ Ward – who was not involved in the incident – was blamed for the incident by Mickey’s side of the family. The crash erupted into violence and in 1993, James shot dead another of John’s brothers – James ‘Bimbo’ Ward. St Albans Crown Court heard the murderer had phoned his victim in 2011 and told him: 'It's me, your enemy. I'm going to wait until you are at your happiest - then I'm going to get you.' Following the birth of his daughter Lilly in April 2013, Thomas told his family he had never been happier. Seeking revenge and hoping to cause as much distress to his family as possible, John organised for his second cousin to be killed and at around 11.30pm on April 23, 2013. As the young family slept in their caravan in Dyes Lane, on the edge of Stevenage, they were woken by the smashing of a window. Thomas opened the door with just a piece of kitchen cutlery for protection to find three masked men outside - one armed with a 12 gauge shotgun. With his wife Theresa standing behind him Thomas was shot in the chest and died less than an hour later in hospital. Following the shooting, John, 33, used a fake passport and fled the country, with his 22-year-old wife Joeleen, brother Francis and sister Winifred. Joeleen, who was five months pregnant, flew out from East Midlands Airport to meet him in Paris. They went on the run, travelling around France and Spain before settling in Denmark. The family were asleep in their caravan in Dyes Lane, Stevenage, when three masked men arrived at the door . Giving evidence during his trial, John said he had panicked and fled after the shooting because he knew he would be blamed. He claimed he had been at home with his wife the night Thomas was shot. Ward said he was scared to return to the UK because he had heard there was a £100,000 ‘contract’ out on him. He was arrested on February 6 this year near Copenhagen, Denmark, and found guilty at an earlier hearing this month. John Ward, of Hatfield, Hertforshire, appeared via a video link up from Bedford Prison, where he is being held, during today’s sentencing. Judge Andrew Bright QC told him he would have to serve a minimum term of 32 years behind bars before he could be considered for release. He told him: ‘Thomas Ward was the victim of a planned and targeted execution in which you played the leading role.’ He said Ward had recruited the gang and then led them to the caravan home of Thomas Ward for the killing to take place. The court also heard that John was just six-years-old when the feud began in 1987, and Thomas was not even been born. Thomas Ward with baby daughter Lilly who was born just five days after he was shot outside his home . But unable to escape their past, they were dragged into a bitter family conflict that had been started by previous generations. Thomas’s funeral last year was seen on a spin off programme of Channel 4’s ‘My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding.’ Detective Chief Inspector Sharn Basra, from Herts Police, said: ‘A young man lost his life in one of the most barbaric way, leaving his baby daughter without a father through no fault of his own. ‘I would like to thank the family for their support of the investigation and their dignity in ensuring justice could prevail. ‘John Boy Ward is clearly an extremely ruthless, violent and dangerous man. Whilst we cannot be clear who pulled the trigger, we know that John Boy instigated, planned and ensured Thomas was killed that night and I am pleased he was has now been given a substantial prison term for his actions. ‘Whilst nothing can bring Thomas back to his family I hope this offers at least some comfort to them. ‘I would also like to make it clear that investigations to identify and trace others who we believe were involved in the planning and facilitation of the killing are on-going. We will continue to make inquiries and speak with people of interest to ensure all those who played a part in Thomas’s murder face justice.’ Adrian Foster, Chief Crown Prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, added: ‘After the incident, John Ward and his pregnant wife, Joeleen Ward, went on the run around Europe. ‘Joeleen was arrested for assisting an offender in January and John was arrested for murder in February in Copenhagen, Denmark on a European Arrest Warrant and extradited to the UK to face the charge. John’s siblings, Francis Ward and Winifred Ward, provided substantial financial assistance to John to help him in his flight from jurisdiction and were arrested and charged with assisting an offender. ‘John claimed not have played any part in the attack, but was convicted of murder despite his denial. Joeleen, Francis and Winifred played a significant part in the aftermath of the murder and have been found guilty of assisting an offender despite their denials. ‘This case represents a tragedy for Thomas’ family, who are distraught by his untimely death. His daughter has been denied the opportunity to know her father. ‘I would like to pay tribute to them for their wholehearted support of this investigation and the dignity they displayed while hearing the horrific details of how Thomas was ambushed and killed.’ Thomas’ family paid tribute to him after the sentencing, describing him as ‘amazing’. Tributes left at the funeral for Thomas Ward after he was shot by his second cousin John Ward . Hundreds of travellers attended Thomas' funeral, which was on Channel 4's My Big Fat Gypsy Christening . ‘We miss him and his beautiful big smile every minute of every day,’ they said. ‘Thomas was good looking, he was flawless and people were very envious of him. He was cheeky but so wonderful too and genuinely cared for everyone, no-one had a bad word to say about him. He was also extremely generous and spent his first ever wages on a present for his mum.’ Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward was held responsible by some family members for the death of his cousin in a car crash in 1987 . Thomas, who grew up in Germany and could speak Spanish and German, was a born-again Christian. He had visited most of Europe and also spent time in America. His family said he was a keen Chelsea supporter and was passionate about fitness and training. ‘He had done so much in his short life but a new chapter as a father had literally just begun,” his family added. ‘He absolutely adored his baby girl and his wife and was a fantastic dad and husband. Every day we are suffering pain because he is not here and it is unbearable to think that his daughter will grow up without her dad. This heart-ache will never leave us.’ John’s wife, Joeleen Ward, 22, who was also on trial with her husband accused of helping him to escape, said her child had been born while they were on the run together in Europe. In the witness box she spoke of her fears for her son’s future safety because of the family feud. ‘I’m still scared for my son growing up,’ she told the jury. She was found guilty of a charge of assisting her husband to flee the country, following the shooting, and she will be sentenced in November after reports have been prepared. John’s brother, Francis Ward, 36, and his sister Winifred, 47, also pleaded not guilty to assisting his escape from the UK. Francis, of Stable Way in Kensington was convicted of assisting an offender and his sister of Cambridge Road in Hounslow was convicted of an identical charge. All three will face sentencing in November. During the trial the court heard that after James ‘Young Fox’ Ward was released from prison in 2001 for the manslaughter of Bimbo, he had been forced to move his family, including Thomas, to Holland, Belgium and Germany for their safety. Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward, pictured with his mother, Lily, was sent to jail for 13 months in July for trying to avenge his son's death . Over the years there were threats and incidents between the two sides of the family. Today Dean Armstrong QC defending said since jury’s finding of guilt against John Boy Ward, police had been investigating internet messages expressing satisfaction over the deaths of him and his two brothers. Threats had also been made to the young son of John Ward and his wife Joeleen - born while they were on the run. Mr Armstrong said in prison John ward was in a double cell because of concerns for his welfare. ‘He says a contract remains on his head because of this awful saga.’","John 'Boy' Ward, 33, had his cousin shot on doorstep of caravan in 2013 .

"Manchester City will be entitled to up to £2million if Gareth Barry signs for Everton upon the expiry of his contract this summer. The 33-year-old midfielder’s deal at the Etihad Stadium runs out at the end of June and he will then be free to talk with clubs in England and abroad as he looks to find a club ahead of the new season. Barry was on loan at Everton last season and he enjoyed an excellent campaign as Everton challenged for a Champions League place before ultimately just falling short in their attempts to secure a position in the top four of the Barclays Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez say Everton are stronger with Gareth Barry . Windfall: Manchester City could cash in if Gareth Barry completes a move to Everton . Everton manager Roberto Martinez is hopeful of persuading Barry to sign on permanently at Goodison Park this summer but it might come at some cost to the Merseyside team. Sportsmail understands that as part of last season’s loan agreement, a clause was inserted that entitles City to a staggered windfall if Barry decides to join Everton. Gareth Barry spent a successful season on loan at Goodison Park after being deemed surplus to requirements . VIDEO Transfer round-up . If he signs a one-year deal at Goodison Park, City will scoop £1m but that figure will rise to £1.5m if the contract is a two-year agreement. If Barry signs a three-year deal, then Everton will be obliged to shell out £2m to the Manchester club. Ordinarily, clubs are reluctant to offer players in their thirties deals that go beyond a year and a three-year contract would certainly represent a deviation from the norm, but with Everton facing competition for Barry’s signature, they may be forced to offer him a deal that he cannot refuse. Barry is expected to renew discussions with Everton later this week.","Manchester City could cash in if Gareth Barry joins Everton next season .

"She has admitted, much to her irritation, that she is better known for ‘getting her kit off’ than her award-winning performances on screen and stage. But it seems Dame Helen Mirren just can’t help herself. Nigel Cole, director of the film Calendar Girls in which the actress had a starring role, revealed he had to force her to put her robe back on after shooting her scene because she revelled in strutting around in her birthday suit. Dame Helen, who stripped for the calendar, admitted in the past:  ‘I’m famous for getting my kit off in England.' Cole said: ‘The actors were very supportive of each other: a bottle of champagne would be waiting whenever anyone finished their nude scene. 'They were all women in their 50s and 60s and were thrilled by roles that recognised their sensuality. 'After one nude shoot, I recall having to tell Helen Mirren to put her robe back on three or four times.’ The 2003 film, based on the true story of Yorkshire Women’s Institute members who disrobe for a charity calendar, was a box office hit and earned Dame Helen, now 69, a Golden Globe nomination. Performing alongside Dame Helen in the film was Celia Imrie, 62, who has admitted, unlike the Oscar-winning Queen star, she struggled with stripping off but Dame Helen led the way. ‘I can’t bear taking my clothes off. I have never been a pretty young thing and stripping off is far more daring when you don’t have a figure to die for. 'But I love a challenge and there was never any question of us wearing flesh-coloured coverings. That would have been a cheat. 'The real-life calendar girls taught all of us in the cast not to take ourselves too seriously - and Helen, who was used to disrobing for the camera, led us on. Celia Imrie said: ‘I can’t bear taking my clothes off.' ‘I was the first. I had first-night-style nerves beforehand but, given that my character was supposed to be nervous, the anxiety actually helped. 'And the rest of the cast made a big fuss of me afterwards in my dressing room, where they’d set out champagne and Twiglets.’ Littered with scenes of tasteful nudity, Cole confesses he struggled to know where to look during filming: ‘However strategically we placed vegetables, bits kept showing through and we’d have to reshoot. 'Even after we’d cut the film, there were things popping out that shouldn’t have been - and a young man from digital remastering had to spend four weeks removing the private parts. Although the nude scenes only took a week, it felt like a year. 'The more you know you shouldn’t look, the more you want to, and I noticed the film crew keeping very busy, working far harder than they normally do because they didn’t want to be caught gazing. 'It was a challenge as a director having to confront veteran actors who were completely naked. I’ve never made so much eye contact in my life. I’d offered to strip, so we were all in it together. 'That might have made it easier for me, but the offer was declined.’ In Cole’s opinion, the film broke the mould for middle-aged actresses – but it did not go down well with many male actors at the time. In his interview with the Guardian, he said: ‘It was rare for a film to focus on middle-aged women and not just show them as mothers or aunties. Director Nigel Cole has confessed he struggled to know where to look during the filming for Calendar Girls . 'But this made it harder to cast the male parts: several actors disliked the idea of being subsidiary to women. 'Also, it was the era of Billy Elliot and The Full Monty, and I was keen to make a film about northern England that was not about poverty and deprivation. 'I remember waiting at Skipton station to be collected by Helen Mirren’s real-life counterpart. Every time a battered old Ford came along, I thought that must be her. 'Then a black BMW roared up blaring rock music and there she was at the wheel. It brought home to me how guilty we all are of stereotyping.’ When interviewed several years ago about her penchant for nudity, Dame Helen, who is married to director Taylor Hackford, said: ‘I’m famous for getting my kit off in England. It did used to get to me but I just kind of ignore it…I’m still doing it! [stripping off]’ Dame Helen has appeared naked in at least nine films during her illustrious career: 1969’s Age of Consent, 1972’s Savage Messiah, then O Lucky Man!, Calligula, Hussy, Excalbur, the Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover, Calendar Girls and Love Ranch.","Dame Mirren revelled in strutting around the set in just her birthday suit .

"It has been a cracking World Cup so far. Even the dullest of games (looking at you, Holland v Argentina!) have had the decency to end with a bit of drama. But with the tournament now building towards Sunday's final, and just two teams remaining (excluding the perennially pointless third-placed playoff), attention's are slowly turning towards the start of next season. And what are often the main points of topic in the campaign following a World Cup? Burnout. Tiredness. Lack of a proper break for star players.

In most danger of a summer hangover are Chelsea, with Jose Mourinho's 2014/15 squad having registered 3,153 minutes at the World Cup so far - a number which could very well rise should Diego Costa complete his long-mooted move to the club. Then come Arsenal in second, with 2,748 minutes clocked up so far. And with German stars Mesut Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski still involved, that number could very well increase. In fact, the potential signings of Alexis Sanchez (390 minutes) and Mathieu Debuchy (360 minutes) would also see the club rise above Chelsea on the list - but until those moves are completed, Arsenal remain firmly in the second spot. Manchester City are third on 2,740 minutes, including 90 from new signing Bacary Sagna, whilst cross-town rivals Manchester United are currently fourth with 2,548 - a number which could yet fall should Patrice Evra (360 minutes) move on. Tottenham round out the top five on 1,932 minutes - with Hugo Lloris clocking up 450 of those for France - and Liverpool are sixth on 1,722 minutes (including new signings Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert), although they could lose 178 of those should Luis Suarez complete a potential move away.

Newcastle rest in 10th on 816 minutes at the moment, with one of those being registered by the mighty Tim Krul. But they are set to lose 360 of the rest as soon as Mathieu Debuchy's departure to Arsenal is confirmed.

"Southampton have made a formal enquiry to Burnley as they attempt to launch their rebuilding project with the signing of striker Danny Ings. The England Under 21 international will see his contract expire at the end of next season and Southampton believe that they can secure the forward ahead of the new season. As things stand, Burnley manager Sean Dyche is demanding £8 million for Ings, who struck 26 goals as Burnley were promoted from the Championship last season. Southampton need a striker to replace Rickie Lambert, who has joined Liverpool, and Ings fits the club’s model to recruit young and ambitious English players. VIDEO Scroll down to see Ings's training ground screamer and show off his dance moves . On the move: Danny Ings (right) could be set to join Southampton from Burnley . However, Burnley’s valuation of the 21-year-old is proving problematic, as Ings will be available on a free transfer in twelve months’ time if he cannot be persuaded to sign an extension with the Lancashire club. Everton and Newcastle are also monitoring the player’s situation, while German sides Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen are also keeping tabs on Ings. Southampton are aware that foreign clubs will have the right to speak to Ings from January and they would be able to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with a reduced compensation rate from the turn of the year. Wanted: Ings scored against Southampton for Burnley in the FA Cup last season . Burnley would ideally like to keep Ings at the club but there is also a recognition that they risk losing him for nothing if a deal cannot be struck this summer. Although Southampton are reluctant to meet the asking price, the swathes of cash flowing into the club following the £31.5million sale of Luke Shaw to Manchester United and Adam Lallana’s impending £25m move to Liverpool, means that the club may be prepared to take the hit as new manager Ronald Koeman seeks to reconstruct his squad.

"Residents living near the epicenter of the Ebola scare in North Texas say they are suffering unfair discrimination due to the stigma of the disease. People living in the Vickery Meadow neighborhood of Dallas believe they have been shunned by the wider community since Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola.

Dallas City Council member Jennifer Staubach Gates told CBS DFW that most of the residents are concerned about the possible stigma of living near the Ivy Apartment complex. 'Unfortunately, they are feeling discriminated against,' she said. 'We still have some that have been turned away from jobs. Some that have been turned away at retail locations. We're getting them in touch with legal aid and any resources necessary.' A cleaning crew has also finished 'Phase 2' of the apartment cleaning process by destroying the majority of Mr Duncan's personal items.

'As of noon today, that apartment is completely cleaned up,' said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings. But Ms Gates believes that educating the public is the only way to reverse the stigma. 'These residents, unless they happen to be one of those that were exposed that are being traced, they are not at risk for getting the disease and are not at risk for transmitting the diseases,' she said. There are forty eight individuals identified as 'high risk' patients, having come in contact with Mr Duncan. Mayor Rawlings explained that these individuals are being seen once a day and are having their temperatures checked twice daily.

That is a good sign.' Mr Duncan, who contracted the disease in his native Liberia, is now receiving doses of experimental anti-viral drug brincidofovir, which has shown promise in fighting the disease. According to Dallas News, the stigma in the community is causing a shortage of volunteers at some charities and community leaders have noticed work-related problems surfacing at others. Ellen Mata, director of mission programs at NorthPark Presbyterian Church told the paper that up to two dozen volunteers failed to show up in the week since the Ebola crisis began. Thomas Eric Duncan - the first person diagnosed in the US with Ebola - is in critical condition in hospital . The decontamination was carried out by hazardous materials specialists and additional cleaning items were carried away in a drum with a police escort on Monday . 'Several of these nonprofits have had volunteers who have backed out on commitments,' she said. 'We are trying to fill those.' 'Some of the after-school programs are needing volunteers to help with tutoring and reading with the kiddos,' she added. 'They are looking for some people to help with special projects. Officials are also concerned that people in need are choosing to stay at home rather than reach out to organizations that can help them.

Ms Gates Told CBS DFW that the faith community is working to  disseminate information among the community to help educate the public. But with over 40 languages and dialects spoken in the community, organizations are facing an uphill struggle  to translate the information and ensure they effectively communicate with everyone. 'It's about you, the public, spreading the word about how this disease is spread. This community is healthy,' Ms Gates said.

"With their beautiful rock formations, crystal lined chambers and colourful landscapes, these are the secret caves that run for 40 miles under south Wales. The images were captured by photographer Brendan Marris, who has extensively explored the Welsh caves system, exploring places few have ventured to go. Mr Marris often descends underground with his camera to shoot the secret landscape below. One of the underground caves below south Wales which have been captured on camera by photographer Brendan Marris . The Ogof Ffynnon Taf cave, one of the longest in south Wales, which is also known as the Lesser Garth cave . A caver stands underneath the rock formations of the Ogof Craig a Ffynnon cave, which was first discovered by persistent digging in 1976 . The part of the Agen Allwedd cave known as the Turkey Streamway. This particular cave is known as a habitat for bats . And now he is sharing his stunning images, which show the secret vast chambers and amazing natural mazes. Mr Marris says he has been a caver all his life and was inspired to start taking pictures on his adventures to try and replicate the images he saw in caving guidebooks. But despite caving all over the UK, the underground chambers of south Wales remain his favourite location, due to their largely unexplored nature. The main chamber of the Saddle Head cave, which is known for its beautiful rock formation within it . The Selenite tunnel of the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu cave, which is one of the most extensive and complex to explore in the whole system . The unusual rock features in the Ogof Draenen cave, which is one of the laegest cave systems in the country . He told his flickr blog: 'Last year on a visit to Dan Yr Ogof we decided not to follow the main passage into the massive chambers that mark the end to the cave but to break off before this point and explore a rarely visited branch passage. 'By avoiding the allure of the Great Hall at the end of the cave, we entered a smaller but stunningly beautiful passage, overlooked by virtually all cavers who are drawn to see the chambers at the end of the cave.' Mr Marris adds that caving can be quite a safe pastime if all the proper precautions are taken and can be very rewarding as he gets to see largely hidden landscapes. A caver crawls through the narrow passages of the Ogof Y Ci cave, which has a number of dry passages . The Piccadilly waterfall below ground in the Cwm Dwr Quarry cave, which is full of maze like passages . A caver climbs up the slab squeeze in the Ogof Foel Fawr cave, one of the shorter chambers of the south Wales underground system . He explained: 'Many people imagine caving as lots of tight crawls and squeezes, thinking it could hold little attraction. 'And if that was all there was, it would be very true — but beyond, lies open passages, deep pits, high vaulted chambers, and streams that meander through the hillside. 'The challenge is to find the route, overcome the obstacles, and follow the passages deep into the mountains to reveal the secrets held within.'

"Oscar Tabarez claimed Luis Suarez had been made a worldwide scapegoat by FIFA during an extraordinary press conference at the Maracana on Friday evening. Tabarez read a pre-prepared 13-minute statement to claim that pressure from the English media after he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini last Tuesday forced FIFA to ban him for four months. The Uruguay coach then immediately quit his position on FIFA’s technical committee and told Suarez that he has the full support of his country’s people. Tabarez was then applauded out of the press auditorium by fawning Uruguayan journalists. VIDEO Scroll down to watch reporters applaud Tabarez's staunch defence of Suarez .

Tabarez . said: ‘Many times you forget the scapegoat is a person who has rights . and that in this specific case, besides the mistakes and faults he has . committed, he has made significant contributions on the pitch. It is the . contribution made by great football players is essential. ‘As . a coach and a professor, and as a former teacher, I am presented with . the theory of the scapegoat. You know what I am talking about, of giving . a punishment, to someone who commits a transgression, not a crime. ‘We . know the protagonists and not only because of the profile he has . because of the mistakes, but there is another side to him. That is a . message: the severity was excessive. ‘Perhaps . I do have the answers but like many people, those who not only have to . make disciplinary decisions - who wins? Who loses? Who benefits? Who is . harmed? Who got things their way? ‘To . one of these questions, I will not give you a final answer, but I will . try to find a response. On the basis of these exaggerated decisions, . only with decisions of this nature I doubt it. After the Suarez and . Chiellini episode we have seen other things measured with a different . measure. ‘When . that happens we have the omission because not all cases have to do with . the transgression with indiscipline.

To the Uruguayan fans, they are moved with the sanctions and to let them know we are hurt with an outstanding force and with the desire to rebel. So more than ever before we will do our utmost.’ Tabarez then went on to explain the reasons behind his decision to quit a FIFA technical study group. He said: ‘We have the right to express our opinions as coach of Uruguay representing us at this World Cup. ‘I trained and grew up in Uruguay as a footballer and a coach. I would also like to appear before you with my background as a coach. Since I was linked to international competitions I was a hardcore defender of fair play, of the developments of values and that aspect has led me to awards and recognition by FIFA of the merits and the organisations such as UNESCO that has declared me a champion.

But because of the inquiry that was opened and we saw the images we saw that there was a possibility that punishment of the participants, Giorgio Chiellini and Suarez, that both would be punished. ‘I cannot deny that we were waiting for the referee to caution or the corresponding disciplinary sanction. ‘We never thought that we were told that the details of the FIFA decision reached of an excessive severity. ‘Any decision which obviously is much more focused on the opinions of the media, the media that attacked immediately after the match. And in the press conference, journalists that only took the only topic. ‘And, I don’t know what their nationality was, but they all spoke English.

I will not discuss that. 'That doesn’t mean we should accept it and the indiscriminate use of that power, the disciplinary committee, which is there to impart justice.’ Tabarez intends to resign from FIFA after their World Cup clash with Colombia following the decision to suspend Suarez. He has the complete support of his players over his decision to suspend Suarez and he refused to take a single question. Tabarez added: ‘Many years ago, I started being linked to FIFA as attache and the technical study group at World Cups and youth tournaments and other events. ‘I had a position and I must leave that position. It is not wise or prudent to be in an organisation with people who exerted pressure, those who rendered the award, who managed criteria and values that are different to the ones I have.

"Meet Britain’s oldest female power-lifter who survived a 30-year battle with cancer by eating raw food and lifting weights. European Champion Pat Reeves, 69, claims she beat brain cancer and fourteen bone cancer tumours by saying no to NHS drugs and competing in the power lifting circuits. British Champion Pat Reeves claims she beat brain cancer and fourteen bone cancer tumours by saying no to NHS drugs and instead changing her diet and competing as a power lifter.

Unable to accept her bleak prognosis, she decided against treatment and set about making healthier life choices and self-treated through a drastic change in nutrition and exercise. But after miraculously fighting herself fit she was left devastated when she was diagnosed with osteosarcoma – in the shape of 14 bone cancer tumours in 1994. After her diagnosis she has endured four heart attacks and three TIA’s connected with this cancer but still she has refused to undergo treatment. Experience: Mrs Reeves began competing on the wight-lifting circuit 26 years ago . Better: The grandmother said she preferred weight lifting to running as weight lifting works the whole body . Determination: Mrs Reeves ignored the bleak prognosis she received from doctors and changed her life . In a bid for survival she continued to self-treat under the guidance of private doctors in Germany, this time changing her diet to raw foods, living on a permanent detox and power lifting. Mrs Reeves added: 'I have kept myself alive by being fit, people are in too much of a rush to take medicine and drugs when we can mend ourselves. 'Powerlifting helped me I guess because it was another focus for me. One of the biggest changes I did was to take up exercise because that’s something that I never did.

'I don’t think I ever come across anyone who thinks I’m mad,' joked Mrs Reeves. 'People are bemused by it and some of them will come around and watch me compete.

Tribute: Brazil's players, including Thiago Silva (left), David Luiz (back left), Oscar (back centre) and Julio Cesar (second right), imitate Neymar's 'E Tois' celebration in a salute to the stricken star . Great significance was read into the fact that the medication administered to the player so far included nothing on FIFA’s banned list. Why bother with that detail,  it was argued, if he wasn’t going to  play again? Suddenly, coming back five weeks early from a stated six-week absence was a credible option. The national characteristic of Brazil is hope. So even now, following a mystified  official statement by the national federation denying Neymar’s return, it remains. They will continue to pray for the miracle, obviously, for this is a religious and superstitious country, too. Yet if hope can be said to have a plan A it is that, without Neymar, some of the more mediocre talents within the selecao sprout wings and fly in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday evening against Germany. Oscar had a good game against Croatia . on the opening day; Willian has potential if given the opportunity; . maybe Hulk through the middle. Seeing red: Willian, one of the favourites to replace Neymar in the starting XI, jogs with a red bib . Must go on: Luiz Felipe Scolari (left) in training at Granja Comary without Neymar . Leading man: If there is one who represents Brazil¿s undying hope, it is Fred (right) Alas, poor Fred. If there is a footballer who embodies Brazil’s default state of optimism it is Fred and the faith Luiz Felipe Scolari, the coach, has in his striker. To the rest of the world, Fred has been as effective at this World Cup as a professional ice-sculpting business in Manaus, but Scolari believes and the nation must, too. Watching Brazil’s match with Colombia last week, Juninho Paulista, whose career at Middlesbrough belies the fact he also made 50 appearances at No 10 for his country, was almost apoplectic at Fred’s inertia. Yet this week, Rio de Janeiro tabloid Meia Hora — Half Hour News, named for being a very light read — depicted the striker on its front page as Superman, flying to the  rescue of his team in their World Cup semi-final. They may have been joking. Capital da Esperanca is the pet name given to the country’s federal capital, Brasilia. It translates as ‘capital of hope’. It was built under the orders of former president  Juscelino Kubitschek as part of his plano de metas, which translates as ‘plan of goals’. VIDEO Willian ready to fill Neymar's boots . Flexible: Dani Alves and Luiz start a complicated series of stretches in training ahead of the Germany game . Your turn: The defensive pair switch roles as Luiz helps Alves stretch his left leg . Nice footwork: The pair look as if they are dancing rather than preparing for a World Cup semi-final . His slogan was ‘50 years’ prosperity in five’, an optimistic leap even by the standards of political rhetoric. And that sums up Brazil. It is a country in which better times are always around the corner, in which the  population remains largely happy and  optimistic despite a murder rate more  conducive with civil war. Between 1980 and 2011, 1.1million people were murdered in Brazil. In 2012 alone, 47,136 were intentionally killed, although that figure is probably between 10 and 25 per cent higher, due to the number of deaths listed as unexplained in the poorest regions. Roads are treacherous and journeys carry an underlying risk of tragedy, with roughly 35,000 dying on the roads each year (compared to under 2,000 in the United Kingdom). Kubitschek’s plano de metas included much highway construction, at the expense of rail transportation, but many of these roads are no longer adequately  maintained and have dangerous potholes and other hazards. Kubitschek himself died in a car accident in 1976 and it is hard to find a Brazilian life that does not contain at least one similar tragedy. A nephew of Brazil coach Scolari died in a car accident on the eve of the  tournament. Garrincha lost two sons, and his mother-in-law, all in separate road  collisions. Man in charge: Scolari orders his men around in training in Teresopolis on Monday . Optimism rises: In such volatile environment, what else remains but hope in Brazil? Highs and lows: Brazil fans will either be celebrating wildly or heartbroken by Tuesday evening . A son of Pele was sentenced to prison for causing the death of a motorcyclist in Santos in 1999, although the decision was later overturned. Neymar was fortunate to survive a serious car accident at the age of four months. In this volatile environment, what else remains but hope? Western tourists now revel in the authenticity of pacified  favelas and while the team is still in the World Cup this remains a pacified Brazil. The locals take the same optimism into their football that they display in their daily lives. Mostly, it will be OK. Mostly, we will be the lucky ones. And, if we are, then the sun is shining and the view might be beautiful, and life is good, and our team wins. E o jeitinho Brasileiro. It’s the Brazilian way. So while Neymar is still mourned - and his team-mates sent a tribute to him by mimicking his 'E Tois' celebration and posting it on Instagram - on Tuesday Brazilians will gather again in an almost evangelical state of expectation. This is also a country in which otherwise rational citizens place their hands on the screens of televisions sets and cry ‘O nome de Jesus’ during penalty shootouts. Their players’ response to the national anthem is cathartic, religious in its intensity. Eyes tight shut, or weeping, they sing, long after the music has stopped. Repeat performance? Luiz Felipe Scolari is on the verge of leading Brazil to a second World up triumph . Heart: Scolari was willing to give Oscar (background) time off after becoming a father . Scolari, an emotional, devout man who embarked on a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Caravaggio near the city of Porto Alegre to give thanks for the World Cup win of 2002, is the perfect choice to lead such a group. At times, he is as emotionally overwrought as the country he leads in this tournament. Asked, gently, about the motivation of Neymar’s absence on Monday, he gave a reply dripping with drama. 'Neymar has left a lot of himself with us, and he will have taken a lot of us with him,' he said. 'He has done his share, now it is time for us to so our share – myself, Thiago Silva, the players, all the Brazilian people.' There is, for obvious reasons, some wonderful writing on football in Brazil — the true name of the Maracana is Estadio Jornalista Mario Filho, after the sports journalist and writer who campaigned most tirelessly for it to be built — yet the country has preferred to deal with Neymar’s injury by emoting rather than analysing. One-man team? Juninho, who played 50 times for Brazil, believes the side are Neymar-dependent . There has been very little criticism, for instance, of Scolari’s brutal approach to James Rodriguez and the more creative players in the Colombia team that may have inspired Juan Zuniga’s fateful payback assault on Brazil’s greatest player. So, how weakened are Brazil by his absence? Statistics suggest, not as much as people think. Since 2010, Brazil have played 60 international fixtures of which Neymar has missed six, and five of those have ended in victory nonetheless. The greatest pull, therefore, is psychological. ‘Brazil are Neymar-dependent,’ said Juninho. He meant as much in the mind as in the way they play. It has been noted, particularly against Colombia, that the backline were frequently bypassing the midfield, in a desperate attempt to pick out their best player as if unable to contemplate an alternate route to goal. This attracted more criticism than any violence in Brazil’s play. It means the game against Germany can take two directions: either the team will look lost without their marquee match-winner, or they will have no choice but to play as 11, rather than 10, plus one. It would be foolish to say they will be better without Neymar, but they might not be bereft. That is the hope, and the fervent prayer. And esperanca springs eternal in Brazil, as it always does.

"Heather Woodfield, 61, (pictured outside the Nursing and Midwifery Council tribunal in Cardiff) failed to seek medical assistance for the unconscious patient . A nurse left an epileptic pensioner unconscious for six hours after she suffered a brain haemorrhage because she thought the patient had experienced a fit and would 'sleep it off', a tribunal heard. Heather Woodfield, 61, failed to seek medical assistance after the woman was found unresponsive in a wheelchair at Springbank Nursing Home in Barry, South Wales, and instead decided to put her to bed. However, the patient's condition failed to improve and she died in hospital four days later due to bleeding inside her skull. Mrs Woodfield, who has been charged with professional misconduct, has now admitted she should have called an ambulance immediately instead of leaving the patient overnight. Giving evidence to the Nursing and Midwifery Council at a conduct and competence committee in Cardiff yesterday, she said: 'In retrospect, I should have called for a doctor or ambulance straight away. I should not have let it go so long.' Mrs Woodfield told the hearing she began her night shift at the nursing home at 7.30pm on July 22 last year. She said: 'The resident was sitting outside in her wheelchair. She was one of those happy people. 'She read the news and liked to tell me what was going on and who had gone in and out of the home.' The nurse said she later visited the resident during her medication round at 10pm and recalled she seemed 'her usual self'. However, the panel heard that, about an hour later, health care assistant Lijomol George informed the nurse that she could not rouse the patient. Mrs Woodfield said: 'I always felt that Lijomol was very timid and shy, so I assumed she was not shouting loudly enough to wake her. 'I went to her room, but, because of our banter, I was half expecting her to open her eyes and say ""fooled you!""' The nurse said she checked the patient's eyes to see if her pupils were dilated and noticed her leg twitch. She said she believed the resident had suffered an epileptic fit and decided to put her to bed so she could 'sleep it off'. She told the panel she visited her again at 2am and 5am when she checked her pulse and reflexes. It was when she made another visit at 7am that she realised there was a problem. She said: 'I raised her arm and it flopped. It was then that I knew my diagnosis was wrong. I realised it was not just a fit and I needed to call the emergency services.' When asked why she had not called an ambulance immediately, she said: 'I just felt that I had experience of epileptic seizures. I felt I could cope because it was something I had done in the past. 'I felt it was something I was capable of looking after, but I was wrong.' An inquest heard last year that the patient was taken to Llandough Hospital in the morning, and died there on July 26. Giving evidence at the misconduct hearing this week, healthcare assistant Ms George said she 'did not understand why Mrs Woodfield did not call a doctor.' She said: 'I told her I was concerned that the resident was not well as she was not responding to us.' Mrs Woodfield failed to seek medical help after the woman was found unresponsive in a wheelchair at Springbank Nursing Home in Barry, South Wales (pictured), and instead decided to put her to bed to 'sleep it off' Ms George said she became concerned for the patient's welfare after she found her apparently asleep in her wheelchair. She said: 'I had never seen her fall asleep in her wheelchair before. I tried to wake her by calling her name and patting her hands and arms but she did not respond.' She told the panel she alerted Mrs Woodfield to the incident who lifted the patient's eyelids and said everything looked 'normal'. The panel heard the nurse subsequently instructed the healthcare assistants to put the resident to bed. Mrs George said: 'She was lying on her back and she was still unconscious.' She told the panel she continued to monitor her every 10 to 15 minutes but the resident did not respond when staff called her name or touched her hands. She said Mrs Woodfield checked on the resident again at 2am and 5.30am but did not call an ambulance. The panel heard that experienced nurse Eileen Roberts arrived to take over from Mrs Woodfield at 7am and called an ambulance within 10 minutes. Mrs Roberts, who qualified as a nurse in 1957 and has worked at Springbank for 12 years, said: 'The resident was lying on her back and sweating profusely. 'I spoke to her but there was no reply. She was a heavy sleeper but I was concerned on this occasion as she was not responding in any way. 'I told Mrs Woodfield that I was going to call paramedics and that she needed to stay in the home to tell them what had happened the night before.' Mrs Woodfield, who was dismissed from her position at the nursing home following the incident, gave evidence to the Nursing and Midwifery Council at a conduct and competence hearing at Temple Court in Cardiff (above) Mrs Woodfield, who admits three charges against her, including failing to perform and document regular observations and failing to seek medical assistance from a doctor or paramedics when necessary, was dismissed from the nursing home following the incident. She had been responsible for 34 residents across two floors of the residential home and has since claimed that staffing shortages contributed to her error of judgement. Tom Watson, operations manager at Springbank Nursing Home which currently houses more than 60 residents aged 65 and over, said: 'It is generally accepted that if a patient does not respond to neurological observation an ambulance should be called immediately.' At yesterday's hearing, case presenter Henry Vallance said: 'These charges, in my submission, amount to a significant failure to provide basic nursing care. 'They are serious charges that represent a significant departure from the standard that the public expect from the nursing profession.' Representing Mrs Woodfield, Daniel Neill said she had displayed 'insight' and 'remorse'. He added: 'She has demonstrated quite clearly to us the remorse that she continues to feel. This has clearly been a traumatic experience for her and one that remains with her.' Mrs Woodfield has since had an interview to become a nurse at another care home in the area, but has not yet received a formal job offer. The hearing continues.","Heather Woodfield failed to seek medical assistance  for patient for six hours .

Four - returning to Brazil, taking over a big team [Palmeiras] and getting them relegated to the second division.'

His last match, however, could be Saturday's Third Place Play-off with Holland in Brasilia. Scolari's insistence that his squad were 'still developing' and that most would be in the 2018 World Cup is not borne out by the facts.

The pampered underachievers — both players and officials — will scuttle towards a convoy of   chauffeured cars and then home to their families. There will be no welcoming party of England fans thankful for having been entertained by their heroes on the greatest football stage in the world. Just a miserable retreat for a pathetic Team England. VIDEO Scroll down for Roy Hodgson: I will continue leading England . End of the World: England's players were supported by nearly 60 staff but still they crashed out early . Home time: England's players will pack their bags and return to the UK on Wednesday . What an unedifying — but fitting — end to this World Cup debacle. This was the team of athletes, coaches, and a myriad of experts that flew from England in the belief that they would be the ‘best prepared team at the World Cup’. What they weren’t prepared for, and neither were the fans who paid thousands of pounds to follow a dream to Brazil, was that England would be out eight days after the tournament had begun. Even now, the humiliation may not be over. England play Costa Rica on Tuesday night in Belo Horizonte. If they lose, this will be their most miserable World Cup since 1950 when England were defeated by the USA in the same city. At least in those days England managed one victory, a 2-0 win over Chile in Rio. That tweed-and-brogue clad party numbered only 17 players, four referees, two trainers, eight sports writers and the manager. It was long before an England team needed an army of sports scientists.So how did it come to this? And how did we get to the stage that the FA’s reaction is to keep calm and carry on? The FA’s blundering chairman Greg Dyke’s timing on Friday was bizarre in the face of such an abject display. A time for review or consideration? Best to review the operations of the whole England set-up? No, Dyke blurted out his and the FA’s full support for Roy Hodgson just minutes before Costa Rica scored the goal against Italy that sealed England’s fate. Unnecessary: Greg Dyke has made a series of needless comments in his role as FA chairman . Hasty: England crashed at the group stage in Brazil but Dyke says Roy Hodgson will not be sacked . Dyke, who likes a report as his ill-conceived England Commission shows, should have, at the very least,  played a straight bat when asked about Hodgson’s future. Then he should have set about a root-and-branch review of England’s approach to this World Cup. The starting point? What exactly did everyone in that ridiculously excessive FA party — only Germany had a bigger delegation — do to justify their place in Brazil? Not a lot in many cases. Trevor Brooking, England’s retiring director of football development who somehow thinks England can win the World Cup in 2018, made a short address in a ceremony in a Miami cathedral to mark the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Apart from that his only noticeable contribution seems to have been endlessly walking around the training ground keeping fit. Keep fit: Sir Trevor Brooking appeared to spend most of his time walking around the training ground . Dyke might also ask why England need a load of blazers hanging around the hotel with nothing to do but wait for the next free drink or dinner. The defunct dinosaur international committee, who haven’t had a meeting for three years since being marginalised by the Club England set-up, still had Robert Coar and Dave Barnard in Miami. Then another four — Ivan Gazidis, Keith Lamb, Peter Barnes and Barry  Taylor — took their places on the FA gravy train for the Brazil leg. And as if this isn’t enough freeloading largesse, Tottenham’s Darren Eales has arrived for the meaningless match against Costa Rica because Gazidis went home after the Uruguay humiliation. Team England flew out with all manner of specialists: fitness and conditioning coaches, doctors, sports scientists, video analysts, security officers, four Club England and FA executives and numerous commercial figures. The whole team will fly back as what Jose Mourinho might call ‘specialists in failure’. Impact? Steven Gerrard talks with sports psychologist Steve Peters but his contribution has been questioned . Perhaps the most heralded member of the team was the acclaimed sports psychiatrist Steve Peters. But he has cut a timid, detached figure, who did nothing either to empower Steven Gerrard and his  team-mates. One leading European coach asked: ‘When is the last time that group of players lined up in the tunnel with a look about them that said to the opposition: “You’re gonna have to play well to beat us today, lads”.’ The answer is probably against Portugal, in the quarter-final of the World Cup in Gelsenkirchen. It was there that England played for an hour with 10 men and were beaten, inevitably, in a penalty shootout. Dyke, who attended a couple of training sessions at the Urca military base, should also demand specific data on the impact of so many sports scientists. England had the best of everything — except the football. At their base in Urca, the FA lavished over £100,000 on ensuring the training pitch was up to standard yet used it on just seven occasions; likewise the media centre, which cost £80,000, partly paid by sponsors Vauxhall, to install. Firing line: Joe Hart and Wayne Rooney fronted up to the early exit at the expensively-assembled media centre . This extravagance was also in evidence during the squad’s three weeks of training before they arrived in Rio. The FA spent more than £100million building a national training centre at St George’s Park outside Burton, yet had less than three full days there during that time. Instead they preferred to go to the Algarve — colder than Burton for part of the week — and then on to Miami at the start of the hurricane season with the first day’s training washed out by rain. And only the FA in their wisdom could complete their World Cup from hell by having a closed training session on Sunday when already out of competition. How much better it would have been to let in fans, who have been totally let down by England, to watch them practise. It was ‘business as usual on a match day minus two,’ said an FA spokesman. Try telling that to the short-changed England supporter. The FA have a habit of putting a positive spin on everything. Why even this World Cup has been a  success: due to FIFA appearance money for World Cup finalists they will make a net profit from their brief stay in Brazil. Nowhere was the FA’s financial obsession better illustrated than when the team was used as clothes horses for kit suppliers Nike’s vast wardrobe of gear. The smiles of the FA officials and staff at England’s military training base on Sunday said it all. School’s out. Soon enough they will pack up their boxes of Nike T-shirts, shorts and socks and travel home with the rest of the team. Grand setting: The FA paid £100,000 for one training pitch but it was barely used . This has been an appalling World Cup campaign and yet the public are supposed to accept the same, dreadful excuses from the FA. To the outsider, no one is really taking this shameful experience seriously enough within that organisation. When Germany, Holland and France have found themselves in similar positions, they have opted for a cathartic overhaul. Not England. At their training camp, you are met by armed, Brazilian military personnel on the way in. Once inside, there is a cossetted, almost arrogant, atmosphere. We are England, it says. We know best. Hodgson is a lovely, charming man. But he has proved beyond reasonable doubt he cannot lead England to success at tournament football. The facts speak for themselves. ‘The players gave me everything I could have asked for and more,’ Hodgson claimed and that proves the point. If they really have given him everything and more, and still lost their opening two group games, there is something profoundly wrong. Every time England come up against elite competition, they get well beaten. Every. Single. Time.That the jobs of  Hodgson and his assistants are safe after such a fiasco – even before the last dead rubber of is played — is beyond belief. However, it is worth casting the mind back to England’s Ashes surrender in Australia last winter. England Cricket Board chairman Giles Clarke was adamant that Andy Flower would remain in charge. And Flower, like Hodgson insisted, couldn’t see any reason why he shouldn’t. A month later Flower, once out of the England bubble of a major sporting event, realised the depth of national feeling and resigned. He admitted that those who had questioned him had been right all along. Hodgson should do the same, but he won’t.","Around 80 England staff will return to the UK on Wednesday .

Questions persisted about the Uruguayan when the club were unveiling new signing Ivan Rakitic on Tuesday, with Andoni Zubizarreta unable to resist commenting.

Suarez's future at Anfield looks more than uncertain as talk surrounding Liverpool's stance on his latest indiscretion continues and whether it could prove a stumbling block for Barcelona. But, on the day he was unveiled, new man Rakitic also had his say. 'To have the character and strength to apologise in front of the world shows what a noble person he is,' the Croatian added. Upon hearing Suarez's apology, former England international Gary Lineker was left in no doubt that it was designed to engineer a move to Catalonia.

"There was something quite striking when Joachim Low held up four fingers at Frankfurt airport on the way to the World Cup in Brazil. Germany’s coach, targeting the country’s fourth title in Sunday’s final, either had balls of steel or he was one of the biggest bluffers in the game. On Tuesday, we discovered that Germany are putting the finishing touches to a world-class team after beating Brazil 7-1 in stunning fashion. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andre Schurrle's pitchside tribute to the Germany fans . Mastermind: Germany coach Joachim Low plotted stunning victory . Germany captain Philipp Lahm, along with Toni Kroos, Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose and Andre Schurrle, were on fire in their remarkable semi-final victory in Belo Horizonte. ‘This is one of the strongest squads I’ve ever played in and we have two excellent players in each position,’ said Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker. ‘This all started with the youth academies developing well in the last five or six years. ‘It started off in 2009 when we won the Under 21 tournament and beat England 4-0, I think. That was a real turning point and five or six players from that team are doing well here. ‘There’s a small link between these two tournaments. That was five years ago, but overall you have to create a team spirit and with those magnificent players growing up together it makes it easier.’ This giant of a defender has been forced out of the team, a substitute during the destruction of Brazil after Low’s defensive reshuffle following the 2-1 victory over Algeria. Success: Six of Under 21 side who thrashed England in 2009 final were in Low's side against Brazil . After that stodgy second round win in Porto Alegre, Mertesacker responded to criticism of the team’s performance by claiming they are ‘not some Mickey Mouse team’. Everybody is taking them seriously. At some stage, probably when it is far too late, the wise men at the FA will look back at the fork in the road at the 2009 European Championship Under 21 final. It was in the Malmo Free Stadium when England lost 4-0 in the final and they were not just beaten. They were destroyed. Six players from that Under 21 team — goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, Mats Hummels, Benedikt Howedes, Sami Khedira, Mesut Ozil and Jerome Boateng — started the semi-final for Germany. James Milner is the only player from that England batch to make it into Roy Hodgson’s squad for their disastrous World Cup campaign here. Germany are different. They arrived at this tournament unbeaten in 15 games and their mission statement was to deliver the World Cup for the people back home. They have been waiting since 1990. Deadly: Germany thrashed England in the final of Under 21 European Championship in 2009 . They are a powerful combination, moving the ball around the pitch with purpose and belief that they are better than the opposition. ‘Everyone is capable of playing and, as you could see, all of the players who came on were magnificent,’ added Mertesacker. ‘We’ve found the team spirit as well during the tournament and that makes the difference.’ Schurrle, the Chelsea forward who came off the bench to round off Germany’s victory with two magnificent goals on Tuesday, said: ‘The people back home are desperate for us to win. If you see the pictures, in every big city there are thousands, hundreds of thousands, watching every match. ‘They’re desperate. They want to see something. We want to give them something.’ On Sunday, inside the Maracana, they expect to deliver. Quiet night: Germany keeper Manuel Neuer (left) was one of the players to move up from under 21 side .

"When the World Cup draw was made USA v Portugal looked a shoo-in for Cristiano Ronaldo’s team.

Spain seek to restore some pride against Australia on Sunday night but that won’t be easy against a Socceroo side who have been unlucky to lose both of their games against Holland and Chile. And it’s not only the fallen world champions who face a period of transition with Barcelona also expected to experience some changes this summer. Until recently, the Catalan giants were regarded as the best club team on the planet. Xavi, who has for so long been the heart beat of Spain and Barcelona, is set to quit the La Liga club this summer and move to the USA or Qatar. End of an era? Following Spain's horrendous World Cup campaign, Barcelona star Xavi looks set for a move . South Korea v Algeria - on air during ITV’s prime time slot at 8pm on Sunday - is hardly one to woo viewers. Even up against Antiques Roadshow or Casualty (There’s a few England jokes in there somewhere). But it could be worth watching just to see blunder prone presenter Adrian Chiles come out with some crass joke about either country, or roll out an old gag like who the first Korean player to appear in the Premier League.* . For the record South Korea had three English-based players last season - recently-released Arsenal striker Park Chu-Young, who spent part of last term on loan at Watford last season, Bolton's Lee Chung-yong  and QPR's Yun Suk-young. Algeria have two in Tottenham’s  Nabil Bentalab and Leicester’s Riyad Mahrez. *It was of course Young Lee Sharpe of Manchester United (boom boom!) Tim Cahill, scorer one of the greatest World Cup goals of all-time with his 'Van-Bastenesque' volley againjst Holland, bows out of international football on Sunday night in Australia's 'dead rubber' clash with Spain. But it may not be the last we see of the 34 year-old midfield marauder. When he finishes the MLS season with New York Red Bulls I hear Cahill could be tempted back to the Premier League for one last hurrah. West Ham and QPR are interested. Pick that one out: Tim Cahill netted possibly the best goal of the tournament so far in Porto Alegre . In an attempt to put a bright spin on it all at the post-mortem press conference Wayne Rooney suggested that England have a bright future ahead of them. Not sure such soothing words were worth the headlines. After all what was he going to  say: 'It’s time to pack up, go home and turn of  of all the lights… we’re doomed.' Some might have hoped he'd added: 'It’s now time to give the next generation a go… so I’m stepping aside. Good luck lads' Here is a possible team to play at Euro 16… without Rooney. Hart; Flanagan, Stones, Tomkins, Shaw; Barkley, Wilshere; Oxlade Chamberlain, Morrison, Sterling; Sturridge. And yours? That said there is every chance that Wayne Rooney will be given the England captaincy. But it understood an alternative is goalkeeper Joe Hart. Talisman: Some might hope Wayne Rooney walks away from the national team but there is every chance he could be captain for England's Euro 2016 campaign . I-Say . The FA must surely review the near £2 million cost of their Brazil training camp which included a staggering support staff of 77… one for every three players. Yet incredibly despite all the back up, luxury hotel and superb training pitch, I hear that some players still found time to complain about the drive time on the team bus from the hotel to the training ground. That was largely due to traffic. The moans illustrate the pampered nature of yet another England squad at a major tournament where egos outweighed energy. If one of the most high profile of the backroom staff, sports psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters, couldn’t solve that problem or confront the mental fragility of some of the players then his inclusion in the 'party' was a waste of time and money. Bet of the Day . It’s been a high-scoring tournament so Belgium to beat Russia and four our more goals to be scored in the game is at 5-1… a decent price given Belgium are 10/11 to win. Both South Korea and Algeria need to win - the unwanted draw is an attractive 21/10 . World Cup moment . Ghana stole a march on Colombia with their dancing celebration after scoring against Germany. So it's appropriate to pay homage to the man who started it all… Cameroon striker Roger Milla who, at the age of 42, took the 1990 World Cup storm with his goals and corner flag jives.","Portugal have only collected one point this World Cup campaign .

"There was a cold expression on Louis Van Gaal's face as he stood on the pitch, one hand in pocket, digesting Holland's exit from the World Cup. There was an air of disbelief that somehow his plans had not come off and Argentina really had just beaten them on penalties to reach the World Cup final. But he will not have long to mourn, a new challenge is afoot at Manchester United and we have already been given a sneak preview of what English football can expect next season. This is no ordinary manager. Sportsmail takes a look at what we've learned about the giant Dutchman during this tournament... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal will rebuild United . Next challenge: Louis van Gaal is set for Manchester United after Holland's World Cup hopes ended . STRENGTHS . Van Gaal is bold to the point of fearlessness. This was epitomised in his substitution of Robin Van Persie in their last 16 match against Mexico. Holland were a goal down with 15 minutes to play. The last person anyone expected to be taken off – particularly the Dutch fans – was the star striker and captain. Partnership: Van Gaal (left) and his star striker Robin van Persie after the shootout defeat against Argentina . Super sub: Klaas-Jan Huntelaar celebrates his winning penalty against Mexico in the last 16 . Van Gaal didn't even flinch as he primed Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and hooked Van Persie. He didn't even waver when considering that if Van Persie had lost the plot, this was also one of the key players he would be managing at Manchester United next season. The Dutch players began firing balls up to Huntelaar on Van Gaal's orders. In the final two minutes they turned the game on its head. Huntelaar won the knock-down header from a corner to set up Wesley Sneijder's 88th-minute equaliser then confidently converted the match-winning penalty, won by Arjen Robben, in stoppage time. WEAKNESSES . Very few weaknesses can be ascribed to the man, and perhaps no major ones. His age, 62, could perhaps be considered one for United fans. Even if he tears through the Barclays Premier League in a whirlpool of success, he will never be able to provide the longevity of Sir Alex Ferguson. Listen up: Van Gaal gives animated instructions to full-back Daryl Janmaat during the Argentina clash . It is also worth noting that despite the winning aura surrounding the Dutchman he has won just two league titles and one German Cup in the past 15 years and in spells at two other European heavyweights – one at Bayern Munich and two at Barcelona – he failed to shine. TOUCH OF GENIUS . In living rooms, pubs, bars, beaches with big screens, slums and street parties across the globe, people turned to each other in bewilderment when Van Gaal substituted goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen for Tim Krul in extra-time stoppage time of their quarter-final match against Costa Rica. Krul had not played a single minute of the tournament. The game was going into penalties. Everyone assumed Krul had an impeccable penalty record. In fact, he'd saved just two of his previous 20. Sports psychologist Cary Cooper explained: 'Van Gaal making such a surprising change just before such a high-stress event would have made it much worse for the Costa Ricans. They would have something else to think about. It would play on their minds.' It got to the the Costa Ricans and Krul saved two to send his side through. Krul blow: Van Gaal sent on Newcastle's goalkeeper to break Costa Rica hearts in the quarter-final shootout . Atta boy: Van Gaal embraces Krul after his substitution proved to be a masterstroke . VIDEO Sub Krul is penalty hero . TACTICS . In this World Cup Holland have played 5-3-2, 4-3-3, 3-4-3, 5-2-3 (at times almost a 7-3-0) and against Argentina on Wednesday night in an attempt to deal with Lionel Messi they switched to 6-3-1 when they didn't have the ball. Although they didn't win, that particular tactic worked and Messi cut a frustrated figure all night. Going nowhere: Lionel Messi (centre right) was shackled by Nigel de Jong in the semi-final . Van Gaal will change tactics at half-time, on the touchline, in his sleep, over dinner, at his kids' birthdays, or even in the drinks break against Mexico with just 14 minutes of the match remaining and his side trailing by a single goal. That, again, worked when they overturned the deficit. 'It's all about winning,' Van Gaal said. 'I want to win. I'm going to pick a system that will help me win.' DISCIPLINE . Only a leader who can instil strict discipline in his players could get them to function in so many different systems in one tournament. Sometimes in a single game. And Van Gaal is famous for his discipline. When at Bayern Munich he insisted that players must eat in the same seat and sit up straight during team meals. Van's the man: The Dutch players listen intently as their boss delivers a stern team-talk in Sao Paulo . One afternoon at lunch, he noticed Luca Toni was slouched over his plate. When Toni ignored his shouts across the canteen, Van Gaal strode over, pulled the 6ft 3ins Toni up by his collar and forced him up-right. From then on, everyone sat up at meals. Toni left the club within a year. His discipline also extends back home. In Dutch there is an informal and formal version of the word 'you.' Van Gaal makes his two daughters, Brenda and Renate, use the formal version when they speak to him. PERSONALITY . Clarence Seedorf played for Van Gaal in the glorious Ajax team of the mid-1990s which won three league titles, the Uefa Cup and Champions League. 'Van Gaal has a strong, explosive personality that brings some extra stuff sometimes but his track record speaks for itself,' Seedorf said during this tournament. It will be interesting to see what is hidden behind this 'extra stuff' but there is no doubt that Van Gaal will enter Old Trafford in a shower of fireworks. The Football Association should brace themselves. In four weeks of this World Cup he has absolutely laid into FIFA. Just look at his face: The pair celebrate Van Persie's stunning header against Spain in the group stage . About the unfair fixture list favouring Brazil. 'FIFA plays these tricks,' he said. About the fact he had 'no view' from his dugout at Estadio Beira-Rio in Port Alegre when they played Australia. About the third and fourth place play-off, blasting FIFA after their defeat to Argentina. 'This game has nothing to do with sports in my opinion,' he raged. 'There is only one prize and one award that counts for anything and that is becoming champion.' In fact, everyone should brace themselves: English football is in for a treat.","Louis van Gaal is set to take over as Manchester United's new manager .

"Speculation is rife over the whereabouts of Kim Jong-un who was last seen on September 3, overweight and limping. And now, SNL has taken aim at the North Korean dictator's mysterious disappearance. Offering a possible reason, the cast mocks his claims that he is still in power but just 'hurt his leg' - and his bizarre fascination with basketball. Fighting fit? Bobby Moynihan portrays Kim Jong-un as crippled in a skit about the leader's disappearance . Missing? The North Korean dictator was last seen limping and larger than usual on September 3 . Bobby Moynihan, playing Kim, screams at a room full of soldiers: 'I broke my ankle dunking Michael Jordan! The movie Space Jam is about me, we all know that!' The dictator harbors an infamous friendship with former NBA All-Star Dennis Rodman, and has invested millions in North Korea's national team. In January, Rodman brought a roster of former NBA All-Stars, including Kenny Anderson, Vin Baker and Cliff Robinson, to the reclusive state to play in a tournament. Former Knick Charles Smith also attended. Limping and groaning in pain, an apparent Kim, played by Bobby Moynihan, hurls abuse at his soldiers who tell him to be more assertive. 'It's just that we're worried,' they tentatively tell him. 'Why am I hearing these ridiculous rumors? That I am diabetic? Ha! That I have the gout? Ridiculous. That I have eaten too much imported cheese! Who dares question me?' They suggest: 'But general, you're limping.' Bizarre: The cast of SNL mocked the dictator's bizarre fascination with basketball in the sketch . Infuriated, he heaves himself across the palatial room in agony and retorts that he was playing basketball. Later on in tonight's episode, Michael Che posing as a news anchor told viewers: 'My money's on more of a Winnie The Pooh situation' - with a picture of Kim seemingly too large to pull himself out of a tree hole. Kim's absence comes as speculation mounts that his sister, Kim Yo-jong, 24, who is Deputy Director of the Workers' Party, has taken over the leadership while her brother recovers from a leg injury. The 31-year-old hasn't been seen in public since September 3. He had been walking with a limp and was more overweight than usual in images that aired before that. An official documentary from late last month described him as dealing with 'discomfort', which led to international speculation that he may be ill. In Seoul, Unification Ministry spokesman Lim Byeong Cheol said that Kim appears to still be in charge of key affairs. He noted that a high-level North Korean delegation conveyed a greetings message to South Korean President Park Geun-hye during their surprise visit to South Korea last week. State media, later reported Kim was suffering from unspecified 'discomfort'. Sources have claimed the dictator had hurt his leg when he joined generals he had ordered to perform physical drills, and required 100 days to recover. North Korea has said nothing publicly about Kim's absence. But it is not the first time he has taken a break from the media spotlight - Kim wasn't seen publicly for about three weeks in 2012, South Korean officials say.","North Korean dictator was last seen September 3 limping and overweight .

"Resignation: David Nieland, a former Homeland Security agent, allegedly paid a prostitute for sex . The investigator who led Homeland Security's internal review of how the 2012 Secret Service prostitution scandal was handled has himself quit after he was reportedly spotted with a hooker. Sheriff's deputies in Broward County, Florida saw David Nieland entering and leaving a building that was under surveillance in a different prostitution investigation, officials told the New York Times. Authorities later interviewed the prostitute and she identified a photograph of Nieland and said he had paid her for sex, the officials said. Nieland resigned in August after he refused to answer questions from the Department of Homeland Security about the incident. A DHS spokesperson said they became aware of the incident in May. Nieland has not been charged. Facebook posts suggest he is a married father. It is not the first twist in the tale that has featured Nieland. The investigator, who was the head of the inspector general's Miami office, had been called in to review the 2012 investigation. Following the scandal, nine agents left the agency after it emerged that they had prostitutes in their rooms while in Cartagena, Colombia for a visit by President Obama. But after the probe, it emerged that Nieland told congressional staffers that he had been pressured to cover up the fact that a White House volunteer also had a prostitute in his room. New scandal: Nieland, pictured with an unidentified woman, denied the allegations to the New York Times and has not been charged. He resigned after he refused to answer questions about the incident . Earlier this month, the volunteer was named as Jonathan Dach, 28, by the Washington Post. At the time, he was just 25 and a Yale University law student, but he now works for the State Department in the Secretary's Office of Global Women's Issues. Nieland said he had been asked to delete the derogatory information from the 65-page public report, which was issued in September 2012, because it was potentially damaging to the administration just two months before the November election. He said that when he and his colleagues questioned how the investigation was being handled, they were placed on administrative leave and removed from the report's chain of command. The congressional staffers  said that no evidence supported his allegation and the volunteer was never charged. The White House also said it had not intervened in the report's preparation. Nieland has said that the prostitution allegation 'is not true' and declined to answer any questions, the New York Times reported. Probe: In 2012, he investigated how the Secret Service prostitution scandal had been handled. Nine agents were fired or left the agency after it emerged prostitutes had been in their rooms in this Colombia hotel . Questions: Nieland said he had been told to keep it quiet that White House volunteer Jonathan Dach (right with his family and President Obama) also had a prostitute in his room. The White House has denied this . He resigned on August 9, citing health problems, and later sent a tweet that his government career had ended. In August, he also thanked people on Twitter for their support about his 'retirement'. A Homeland Security Department spokesman, William O. Hillburg, confirmed to the Times that Nieland had resigned and that officials had become aware of an incident in Florida that involved one of its employees. Under law, no comment could be offered on a specific case, Hillburg said. Thirteen Secret Service agents and officers were implicated in a prostitution scandal that arose from preparations for Obama's trip in April 2012 to the seaside resort of Cartagena. They were accused of carousing with female foreign nationals at a hotel where they were staying before Obama's arrival. Nine of the officers and agents eventually left the agency - resigned, forced out or retired.","David Nieland 'was seen entering and leaving a building that was under surveillance in a different prostitution investigation in Broward County'

"A psychiatric hospital has revealed its hidden rooms and treasures which have remained untouched for more than 40 years after it was set up as Quaker hospital in the 18th century. Hidden beneath The Retreat lies a morgue which has been under lock and key since the 1960s as well as cupboards, swathed in dust, containing finely preserved treasures such as a cannon ball and monkey skull, which have been accumulated in the last 400 years of the hospital. The hospital, in York, was set up by William Tuke, a retired tea merchant, in 1796 after he was appalled at the conditions at York Asylum, where Quaker Hannah Mills died. Many of the buildings which make up the Retreat, which functions as a psychiatric hospital today, are listed making many of them difficult to renovate. Scroll down for video . The basement of The Retreat in York has laid hidden for more than 40 years, with items covered in dust . Items found in the cupboards of the hospital include monkey's skull (left) and an old blood pressure test (right) The Retreat in York today remains a fully functioning psychiatric hospital after it was built for Quakers in 1796 . Lancashire boilers were installed in the boiler room of the retreat in 1922 and have not been used since 1970s . This meant some rooms and the items donated from patients and collected from around the world were abandoned and left to accumulate dust for dozens of years. A room in the basement by the main building contains a huge coal boiler used to heat the entire building with a mass of cogs and pipes stretching into the roof.The Lancaster boiler, which was installed in 1922, has remained completely out of use since the late 1970s early 80s. A pin board, dated 1915, features a poem believed to have been written by the boiler room's former workers, along with another note reading 'Into this boiler room have walked the best people in the world, my friends.' Also left preserved is the hospital's former morgue, which was built in the Victorian era and fell out of use in the 1960s, when undertakers were able to collect bodies quicker than before.The room houses the original marble slab used for bodies and an incinerator. The boiler room had not been used since the 1970s and a poem from 1915 was found on the pin boards there . The mortuary, built in 1920s, has laid unused for decades but the original table has been found preserved . Dusty cupboards contained plasters and medicines that had been preserved for decades in unused rooms . An Electro Convulsive Therapy (CVT) machine (left) was found along with silver service equipment (right) Old paint, containing lead, was found stored in rooms - many of which have been under lock and key for years . Another empty building once housed students in the 1940s and 1950s, and still holds exam books from the 1930s. In the cellars beneath the main building there is a trolley full of film reels, which are likely to have been shown to patients at the hospitals. Dozens of dusty cupboards contain items such as oxide plaster, baby powder, tools, aprons and boots, which have all been well preserved over the last three decades.Other items found include is a cannon ball excavated from Lamell Hill, a vase found on the site in an excavation in the 1800s, an ostrich egg and even a monkey skull. Martyn Ferguson, who works at The Retreat, said some of the rooms have been left under lock and key . A trolley containing old film reel was found and was probably used from around 1954 as patient training aids . An incinerator, from the mortuary and pictured left, as well as an ostrich egg (right) were among items found . A bedroom to accommodate male trainees, built in 1927, was one of the rooms left abandoned at the hospital . Time records, believed to have been completed in the 1930s, were found in rooms at The Retreat . Several treasures were found preserved in cupboards and dusty rooms, including a ledger of painting work . The Retreat in York is a psychiatric hospital open today and was built to improve care for Quakers in 1796 . The Retreat became officially operational with the arrival of its first patient, Margaret Holt, from Bradford, for a fee of eight shillings per week. 'The history of The Retreat is wonderful,' said Martyn Ferguson, Head of Facilities Management. 'Over the years there have been lots of different buildings in use as the site has always been a place on innovation in the mental health sector. Medicines and equipment, found preserved on dusty shelves and in corners were revealed in the rooms . Items of equipment, including an old blood pressure taker (left) and silver service equipment (right) were found . A vase (left) was found on in the 1800s and silver service equipment (right) was in the steward's rooms .

Much of the equipment and items found had been preserved, despite not being used for several decades . 'When they were not required there, we had to close the doors and leaving them as they were. It is very difficult to upgrade a listed building to modern standards, especially with grounds being a conservation area.' Mr Tuke's grandson, Samuel Tuke, is also buried in the grounds of the site.

"The woman is 39 weeks pregnant (posed by model) A judge has ruled a mentally ill woman who is 39 weeks pregnant will have a Caesarean section because she had visions of babies 'popping out.' Mrs Justice Roberts heard that the woman's unpredictability meant she posed a risk if she was to try and give birth naturally. The judge gave specialists the go-ahead to perform a planned Caesarean section following a hearing in the Court of Protection - which sits in private to make decisions involving sick and vulnerable people. The court heard that the woman, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia, lacked the mental capacity to make decisions about her own treatment. At a hearing last night both medical experts and the woman's husband gave evidence. Doctors said the woman's 'level of unpredictability' posed a risk if a natural delivery was attempted. A psychiatrist said the woman had a 'child-like vision' of babies 'popping out'. They said a delivery by planned Caesarean section was the safest option - and the woman's husband agreed. The judge said she was satisfied that a planned Caesarean section was in the woman's best interests. She added that the woman - who is Polish, in her 30s, suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and is detained under the terms of mental health legislation - could not be identified. But she said the health authority which had made the application could be named as the London North West Healthcare NHS Trust . The NHS trust had asked the judge to rule that delivery by planned Caesarean section would be lawful. Lawyers appointed by the court to represent the woman's interests had supported that application. Mrs Justice Roberts said the woman was not resisting undergoing a Caesarean section. London North West NHS Healthcare Trust manages Northwick Park and St Mark's Hospitals in Harrow and Central Middlesex Hospital in Park Royal, as well as Ealing Hospital. It has been given the go-ahead for surgery . But she said she simply lacked the capacity to make an informed choice. The judge was told that the woman was likely to undergo surgery within the next two days. The Court of Protection, based in London, sits in private and makes decisions about the medical treatment, care and property of those who cannot decide for themselves. It can deal with life or death decisions  for people who are incapacitated. Judges sitting in the court can also send people to prison in private. But the secrecy of the court has recently been criticised. Sir James Munby, head of the family courts, has repeatedly called for more openness. The Court of Protection is based at the Royal Courts of Justice in London and makes decisions in private .","Woman has paranoid schizophrenia and visions of children 'popping out'

"A miracle baby was born after doctors glued him into his mother's womb – ending her 15-year struggle to have a child. Emma Ryley, 43, from Milton Keynes and her husband Paul, 42, had been trying to start a family since 1999, five years after they got married. The birth of their first baby, Ethan, is an early success for a new technique using embryo glue which works by increasing the embryo's ability to stick to the side of the womb. Baby Ethan Ryley was born weighing 5Ib 15 after his parents tried new fertility technique using embryo glue . The embryo is dipped into the gluey substance prior to being put back into the womb during IVF treatment. Mrs Ryley, who is head of estates for a building company, said: 'It was the most emotional moment when I finally held Ethan in my arms, and I knew I was a mum at last. 'We'd had so many years of heartbreak, but now we finally had our miracle baby - and it was all thanks to a tub of glue. 'It seemed a strange concept for him to be glued into my womb, but it certainly worked.' His mother Emma Ryley said: 'It was the most emotional moment when I finally held Ethan in my arms, and I knew I was a mum at last' 'We had started trying for a baby but nothing had happened after several years of trying. 'We were referred to hospital and had numerous tests, but the doctors couldn't find anything wrong with either of us, so we just had to keep trying.' She was put on a fertility drug to boost egg product but that didn't work. They kept trying but she never fell pregnant. She said: 'We tried for years and years, and had even more tests, but nothing ever came back that anything was wrong. I thought I was destined never to become a mum. It was heartbreaking. As the years went by, my dream of motherhood just seemed to get further and further away. 'We had started to discuss adoption as we thought it was the only way that we would become parents.' Mrs Ryley and her husband Paul, 42, had been trying to start a family since 1999, five years after they married . Ethan was born at Milton Keynes Hospital a week after his mother bleeding heavily at 36 weeks . In December 2012 the couple decided to try IVF treatment and three months later they had an appointment at CARE Fertility in Milton Keynes. They started their course of IVF treatment. Mrs Ryley's eggs were collected and harvested with her husband's sperm. After the treatment they had three viable embryos and one was put back into her womb. But before the transfer, doctors at CARE Fertility suggested using the new glue to give the embryos a better chance of sticking to the womb, . Mrs Ryley said: 'We had never heard of anything like this before, but we were willing to give anything a try. We had been trying for a baby for 15 years and I'd never fallen pregnant before in all that time. 'We knew that time was running out for us, so we wanted to give it everything we could. When doctors told us they could use this new glue to literally glue our baby into my womb, we agreed to try it. 'It was a surprising and unusual concept, but it seemed simple enough.' She started bleeding at 36 weeks and was rushed into hospital. Baby Ethan was born a week later in March, weighing a healthy 5Ib15, at Milton Keynes Hospital. Research has shown that using the glue has increased the live birth rate by eight percent. A spokeswoman for CARE Fertility, which treated Mrs Ryley, said: 'This is a new form of treatment that we have been using for about 18 months and it has shown promising results.' Embryo Glue is a viscous (thick) solution containing high concentrations of an adherence (sticky) compound called Hyaluronan. Adherence of the embryo to the lining inside the womb will aid implantation. Hyaluronan is naturally present in the fluid in both the ovaries and the womb, and the level is known to rise in the womb at the time of embryo implantation. The exact mechanism by which Hyaluronan promotes implantation has not yet been identified, however scientists believe that it assists implantation by: . Embryo Glue can be used for the transfer of cleavage stage embryos and blastocysts in both fresh and frozen cycles and can therefore benefit any patient undergoing IVF treatment. Studies have demonstrated that Embryo Glue is particularly beneficial for patients who are over 35 years old, patients with a history of failed implantation and for patients with unexplained infertility.","Emma Ryley, 43 and  husband Paul struggled to have a baby for 15 years .
