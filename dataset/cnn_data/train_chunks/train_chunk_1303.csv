"Google is investing further in the underground cable network by backing a project that will span the Pacific Ocean. Called Faster, the $300 million (£178 million) scheme will connect Japan to the west coast of the US. The cable will stretch 5,000 miles (8,000km) under the ocean, and will then link up with local cable systems already in place. Called Faster, the project will connect Japan to the west coast of the US. The cable will stretch 5,000 miles (8,000 km) under the ocean, at depths of around 7,000 miles (11,300 km), and will then link up with local cable systems already in place. Faster is expected to be complete by Spring 2016 . A submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed between land-based stations. It is laid by specially designed ships that can carry thousands of miles of coiled cable in their holds and can lay it as it travels across the ocean. The first commercial cables were laid in 1850 to send telegraphy traffic. Since then the cables have been used to send telephone traffic, and most recently data traffic. Many of the modern cables are made of fibre optic. Trial cables were laid in 1842 in New York harbour and were insulated with tarred hemp and rubber. Nowadays, cables are protected using polyethylene. Traditionally the cables were owned by service providers, yet websites have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks including Google and Facebook. Faster is expected to be completed by Spring 2016. On the Japan side, the cable will land at Chikura and Shima and is designed to improve the network further into Asia. While on the US side, the cable will connect networks in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle. ‘At Google we want our products to be fast and reliable, and that requires a great network infrastructure, whether it's for the more than a billion Android users or developers building products on Google Cloud Platform,’ said Urs Hölze, senior vice president of technical infrastructure at Google. ‘And sometimes the fastest path requires going through an ocean. 'That’s why we’re investing in Faster, a new undersea cable that will connect major West Coast cities in the US to two coastal locations in Japan with a design capacity of 60 terabits per second.’ That’s ten million times faster than a household cable modem. Google has previously invested in other cable projects, including Unity in 2008, which also joined Japan to the US, and the South-East Asia Japan Cable (SJC) in 2011. This interactive map plots the location of all the underwater submarine cables across the world. It was created by Washington-based TeleGeography . The SJC links eight points in Asia including Chikura in Japan, Shantou in China, Chung Hom Kok, Hong Kong, Nasugbu, the Philippines, Telisai, Brunei, Songkhla, Thailand, and Tuas, Singapore. Google has previously invested in other cable projects, including Unity in 2008, and the South-East Asia Japan Cable (SJC) in 2011 (pictured) In addition to Google, the Faster project has been backed by China Mobile International, China Telecom Global, Global Transit, KDDI, and SingTel. Mr. Woohyong Choi, the chairman of the Faster executive committee, said: 'Faster is one of a few hundred submarine telecommunications cables connecting various parts of the world. 'These cables collectively form an important infrastructure that helps run global Internet and communications. ‘The Faster cable system has the largest design capacity ever built on the Trans-Pacific route, which is one of the longest routes in the world. ‘The agreement announced today will benefit all users of the global Internet.' Almost 95 per cent of the internet used everyday is carried between countries through two-inch (50mm) thick lines. In 2006, submarine cables carried just one per cent of traffic - an increase of 94 per cent in just eight years, according to official figures from the International Cable Protection Committee. Since 2012, the number of submarine cables have almost doubled from 150 to 285.","The $300 million (£178 million) global project is called Faster .

"Pro-Russian separatists used tanks, artillery systems and rocket launchers in their fight to capture the airport in the rebel-held Ukrainian city of Donetsk yesterday. Defence officials said the rebels fired on the terminal, as well as shelling areas nearby, including housing blocks, where four people were killed on Monday. And that there has been no letup in efforts by pro-Russia separatist fighters to capture the airport, despite a cease-fire agreement being in place for over a month. A commander for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, takes position on the outskirts of Donetsk, where officials says pro-Russian separatist fighters have continued to fight to try and gain control of the airport .

Security spokesman Andriy Lysenko said fighting had been reported across the Donetsk region. More than 3,500 people have been killed in the fighting between government forces and the separatists in the industrial east, according to United Nations figures. A total of 64 Ukrainian armed service personnel have been killed since the ceasefire came into force on September 5, military prosecutor Anatoly Matios said. Altogether, 956 armed service personnel have been killed in the conflict. But the continuing conflict has all but fallen off the international radar, as the war to stop ISIS militants reign of terror takes centre stage.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's pro-Western government pressed ahead to secure new laws to tackle top-level government corruption yesterday. The government is hoping to ease public discontent before an election from which it wants backing for its plan to end a separatist rebellion. The proposed laws - presented by Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk ahead of an October 26 parliamentary election - will oblige high-level officials in government, the judiciary and law-enforcement to declare their own and their families' assets and financial transactions. Bribery has been widespread at virtually all levels of Ukrainian government and public life since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. International watchdogs say it got worse during the past four years under ousted President Viktor Yanukovich. Under the legislation, the declared income of civil servants will be measured against lifestyle and property holdings, and an independent agency will investigate discrepancies.

Details about property holdings and shares held by top state officials must be declared on an electronic register for public access. And officials' bank accounts will be open to monitoring by a state committee for possible money-laundering. The proposed laws, which passed a first reading in parliament yesterday and will have a second and final reading next week, are part of a drive by the pro-Western leadership to raise Ukraine to European standards and distance itself from the culture of its former Soviet master, Russia. Kiev expects to boost its eligibility to join mainstream Europe despite the conflict in the east and opposition from Moscow, which it accuses of arming pro-Russian rebels that have declared independence. President Petro Poroshenko is hoping this month's election will produce a strong coalition to support his push for a peace plan dealing with the separatists while keeping Ukraine on a course of European integration. The anti-corruption push came as Russian President Vladimir Putin celebrated his 62nd birthday in the wilderness of Siberia and his supporters created tributes in his honour. Putin celebrated his birthday yesterday in the Siberian forest some 185-250miles from the nearest populated area, his press secretary said.","Pro-Russian separatists use tanks, artillery system and rocket launches .

"Murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence was honoured by world-renowned architect David Adjaye last night in a lecture marking 21 years since his death. Stephen’s ambition was to become an architect before he was stabbed in a racist attack in 1993. Giving the 14th Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture, Mr Adjaye – a British architect who was awarded an OBE in 2007 – said he was ‘incredibly honoured’ to be appearing in Stephen’s memory. Baroness Doreen Lawrence, attending the 14th annual Stephen Lawrence Memorial . He talked about his career highlights, which include the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC and the £160million Moscow School of Management Skolkovo. He is also acclaimed for his design of the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford, south-east London, which he described as a ‘hugely important project’, designed ‘as a memorial and a place to reflect and remember Stephen’. The lecture was held in aid of The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, which helps disadvantaged students to pursue a career in architecture. Stephen’s ambition was to become an architect before he was stabbed in a racist attack in 1993. Stephen’s mother Baroness Doreen Lawrence, who campaigned for justice for her murdered son, marked the occasion at the Royal Institute of British Architects in Westminster by introducing the charity’s two new career mentoring programmes for young people. She also praised the recipients of the Trust’s architecture bursary.

"The world’s biggest accountancy firm Deloitte, powerfulbanks Credit Suisse and Chase Manhattan, and giant law firm Richards Butler, now part of Reed Smith –which represented Gordon Brown at the Leveson Inquiry – are all on a secret list belonging to a corrupt private detective. A Mail on Sunday investigation has also established the rogue investigators jailed last year for illegally accessing information by ‘blagging’ appeared to be linked to international solicitors’ firms Herbert Smith –which represented former RBS boss Fred Goodwin – and Clyde & Co. Last night a senior Westminster source . indicated that all six firms are on the classified Serious . Organised Crime Agency list currently locked away in a safe opposite . theHouse of Commons. ‘Blagging’ is defined as obtaining information without consent. But The Mail on Sunday has also uncovered new SOCA evidence often further blue-chip firms – whose names were recorded by one of the detectives – including Manchester United sponsor and insurance giant AON, and Jyske, a Danish bank. The evidence we have seen shows that SOCA were aware of the names of the companies five years ago. MPs have demanded that the companies’ names are made public. There is no evidence that those named knowingly employed the rogue detectives in criminal activity on their behalf. It is unclear whether the other names also appear on the list passed to MPs. We can also reveal that Morgan Sindall, a construction company with multi-million-pound Government contracts and Greymans, a bespoke security firm specialising in work for celebrities, were both linked to the detectives in cases which resulted in prosecutions. The list came to light two months ago. SOCA handed the secret list of 102 over to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee . Our revelations last night led to calls for the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry to be widened beyond the media so that it includes the use of private eyes to perform illegal acts by any clients. The controversial SOCA list of 102 customers was handed over amid great secrecy to MPs on the Home Affairs Committee last month. The existence of the clandestine list . emerged two months ago. Since then there have been repeated calls for . the agency dubbed ‘Britain’s FBI’ to name the companies. But . SOCA’s former chairman Sir Ian Andrews – who resigned over a conflict . of interest last month – prevented publication of the names as it could . ‘substantially undermine the financial viability of major organisations . by tainting them with public association with criminality’. Last . week Trevor Pearce, SOCA director general, said: ‘I repeat the point we . are not alleging that the individuals or companies named on the list . have or even may have committed a criminal offence.’ Today this newspaper is listing the names of companies and individuals who are linked to the convicted detectives. Our enquiries into the SOCA files revealed: . There is no evidence that the company was aware of the illegal activity. SOCA’s investigation into private eyes, called Operation Millipede, began in 2008 when infamous blagger Daniel Summers, 34 – already under surveillance – advertised an iMac computer for sale from his home in Kingston-upon-Thames. Undercover officers bought the computer for £590 and, after forensic examination, retrieved a number of files which Summers had sought to destroy. This led police to four other private investigators, three of whom, along with Summers, were convicted of fraud for their part in the blagging of information on a number of victims in 2007 and 2008. When arrested in May 2009, Summers told officers: ‘I know why you are here, this is massive. I’m in the biggest s**t imaginable. ‘Do you want me to talk now? I’ll sing like a canary.’ Summers, described as the ‘lynchpin’ along with former policeman John Spears, Graham Freeman and one other man who cannot be named for legal reasons, were all jailed at Kingston Crown Court last year. After the case, SOCA tried to justify why they had only investigated the private eyes rather than any third parties by saying: ‘In recognition of the fact the operation might also uncover information relevant to other authorities, SOCA worked in partnership with a number of bodies including [data protection watchdog] the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). SOCA will now hand over any such information to its partners to determine whether further action is appropriate.’ But the ICO has still not been handed the information discovered during the Millipede investigation. SOCA said they decided to make it available first to the Metropolitan Police’s Operation Tuleta team, an ongoing investigation into computer hacking, primarily by journalists. But last week it emerged that while some evidence on the Millipede had been passed over to the Scotland Yard team, it was not until three weeks ago that Met Commander Neil Basu was handed an official list showing customers organised into business sectors. SOCA’s decision to block publication came as the newspaper industry was targeted in the phone-hacking inquiry, which led to widespread public revulsion and the largest criminal investigation in British history over practices which include the hiring of corrupt private eyes. In light of the revelations, there have been calls for Lord Justice Leveson's hacking inquiry to look beyond the media . Even lawyer Mark Lewis, representing the family of hacked murder victim Milly Dowler and a scourge of the tabloids, has said: ‘Consistency demands that the same rules apply to all, whether you run a newspaper, a pharmaceutical company or a law firm.’ Documents uncovered in our investigations suggest that in 2008 major tunnelling contractor Morgan Sindall investigated three of its own employees suspected of taking ‘kickbacks.’ Some of the work was carried out by Dan Summers. As with many of the cases, there was a complicated chain of command involving companies hiring private detectives who might subcontract work to other private detectives who may not be so scrupulous in their methods. Last year a private investigator who was arrested and later cleared in the ‘blagging’ case took Morgan Sindall to an employment tribunal claiming he had been promised a job in return for keeping the company’s name out of the inquiry. His case was thrown out, but during the hearing the company’s lawyers revealed that around September 2009 the firm was ‘advised by solicitors that it faced no charges and indeed that at no stage did it fear criminal prosecution’. A spokesperson said: ‘Morgan Sindall Group takes issues of fraud and misconduct very seriously and operates a whistleblowing system through which individuals can register any concerns. All such investigations are conducted properly and within the confines of the law.’ Greymans, now called Optimal Risk, is one of the companies mentioned in Spears’s files. Greymans specialises in handling problems and security issues for celebrities and wealthy individuals discreetly. Founded by Falklands veteran and ex-Parachute Regiment Major Mike O’Neill, 56, it was formed in 1993 and boasts of clients including multinationals, finance houses and law firms. Our files show that the company used the services of the corrupt detectives on numerous occasions, and a trail of emails prove it often directly engaged Summers – usually through its former financial controller, Andy Driver, who died of alcohol poisoning in 2011. Mr O’Neill failed to answer our calls or emails last week, but former operations director and ex-Met Special Branch officer Christopher Cully, who left the firm three years ago, yesterday denied that Greymans had engaged Summers. Another company linked to the case is Keltbray PLC. The large rail contractor does not appear on the SOCA list itself, but it is closely linked to a firm which does: Gamble Rail. Deloitte- the world's biggest accountancy firm- was one of the names on the top secret list . Keltbray is a specialist demolition and civil engineering contractor recently awarded a £46 million contract to build power infrastructure alongside the West Coast Main line for Network Rail. Since 2008, Keltbray has donated £63,500 to the Conservative Party and a further £20,000 to Dr Liam Fox MP, according to the Electoral Commission. We have seen a fax sent in July 2008, by chartered accountant Michael Bilton, 59, a director of Gamble Rail, giving the bank account numbers of a business rival he wanted to be examined and ended with: ‘Requirement: Special investigation on his personal and business bank accounts.’ In 2009 Gamble went into liquidation and was taken over by Keltbray, and Bilton became finance director at one of the group’s companies, Keltbray Aspire Rail. Contacted by The Mail on Sunday, Bilton said he had never been asked about the fax by SOCA or any other police officers, but admitted sending it. ‘It’s not something I’ve ever done before or since. At that time, I wasn’t asking anything illegal to be done. I didn’t know what someone could or couldn’t get through legal means,’ he said. When we asked him, as a chartered accountant, whether he knew of any legal means to investigate an individual’s personal bank account without his consent, he replied: ‘I assumed – obviously wrongly – that it would be done by fair means, not foul means. I just hadn’t thought it through.’ A spokesman for Keltbray said: ‘We would, of course, prefer if you did not refer to Keltbray in your article, given that the events you refer to date back to 2008 when Mr Bilton was not employed by Keltbray. He was employed by us from 2009 to 2012, and as a director of the rail division only in the last two of these years – from 2010 until 2012.’","Controversial SOCA list that had been kept top secret was handed over to MPs last month .

"Sajid Javid, the Culture Secretary, will pledge that the Conservatives will set up a 'small business conciliation service' The Tories will today promise a crackdown on the scandal of late payments totalling £40billion to small businesses. Sajid Javid, the Culture Secretary, will pledge that the Conservatives will set up a ‘small business conciliation service’ to help smaller firms resolve disputes with larger customers. In his speech, which marks Small Business Saturday, he will say that his upbringing above a shop means he understands what small companies go through. When Mr Javid was four, his father took over a ladieswear shop in inner-city Bristol, and the family moved into a two-bedroom flat above it. He will say: ‘Recent figures showed that last year alone there was £40billion still owed to small businesses. This is an absolute scandal. ‘We lived above the shop – my parents and their five sons. And that upbringing seared something onto our souls: a belief in enterprise, opportunity, reward for hard work. ‘So I know what it’s like for small businesses. Your fortunes, your happiness – they fluctuate with the day’s takings. ‘We are fed up with the way so many hard working, reliable people are being treated.’ He will add: ‘Today I can promise that we will take action. We will legislate to take action against unfair contractual practices I am confident our measures will help thousands of businesses get the billions of pounds they’re owed. And it’s right we do so. Because you’re the backbone of our economy, and you shouldn’t have your backs broken by clients who don’t keep their side of a deal.’ Speaking in Birmingham, Mr Javid is expected to promise legislation to make sure 30-day payment terms are passed down the supply chain on all public sector contracts. Poor performers on late payments will be named and shamed through the Small Business Bill, and there will be a requirement for all government suppliers to adhere to the prompt payment code. Suppliers who flout the code will be struck off. And in addition to the Conservative manifesto pledge to set up a ‘small business conciliation service’, business minister Matt Hancock will write to all FTSE 350 companies asking them to adhere to the prompt payment code. The department of Business, Innovation and Skills will also launch a survey of businesses on how the code can be strengthened, and there will be action to stop big companies changing contract terms retrospectively.

"There are a number of job descriptions waiting for Darren Fletcher when he settles in at West Brom but the one he might not have expected is Saido Berahino’s nanny. Fletcher’s unveiling as the deadline day signing from Manchester United was almost eclipsed by the 21-year-old striker, who is acquiring the habit of talking himself into trouble. Ten years Berahino’s senior, Fletcher will be expected to mentor a player who told the world this week that he wanted to play for a bigger club. Tony Pulis has advised Saido Berahino to focus on his performances at West Brom . Darren Fletcher has signed for the baggies where he will be asked to provide a role model for young players . That is off the pitch. On it, the Scotland midfielder wants to prove he is good enough to cut the mustard in the Premier League after finding starts harder and harder to come by at Old Trafford. Head coach Tony Pulis believes that Fletcher, who has agreed a three-and-a-half year contract, will be captain of Albion one day. Having checked with Sir Alex Ferguson last year when he was Crystal Palace, Pulis did not need any more due diligence before moving in when a deal with West Ham collapsed. Pulis wants Fletcher to be his voice in the dressing room, especially when it comes to the younger players who may be led astray. Berahino has caught the eye with impressive performances at West Brom and suggested he could move on . Berahino’s latest outburst this week comes after he was found guilty of drink-driving and after he moodly refused to celebrate a hat-trick against Gateshead. ‘Things are not what they used to be,’ added Pulis. ‘The mentors for these young lads are just not there. These kids need guides and mentors so that the youngsters can respect them and take notice. ‘I think Fletch will be critical to that sort of stuff but give him time to settle in. As a character, having worked with him for a week, he is first class. He got through his illness with flying colours and I see him as a future captain of the club.’ As for Berahino, he will escape a fine. ‘He's been in a naughty chair. That's in my office,’ joked Pulis, although the underlying message was rather more serious. ‘We've had no phone calls. He needs to stop listening to all the kerfuffle.. This is a great football club with great players. And Saido has not become that yet. Pulis praised recent recruit Darren Fletcher and feels he could be an ideal role model for Berahino . ‘The question was whether would he like to play in a top four team and everyone wants that. His responsibility is to work for us until that happens. ‘I've spoken to him and his people. He has to do it rather than talk about it. That's what good players do and then clubs will be interested. He's done an interview but not for what he was supposed to be talking about.’ Fletcher has already been impressed by Berahino on the training ground but admitted: ‘The lads have gone straight into him. He has said something and he will learn from it. ‘He loves West Brom and wants to do well. He’s a young player who said something he shouldn’t and he probably regrets it. I’ve done that, all young players do that. ‘On first impressions he looks very sharp, a real goalscorer. He’s not shy!. Giving me orders straight away because he wants to score goals. He’s a nice kid welcoming, respectful and can be big influence for rest of season.’","Tony Pulis believes Saido Berahino should look up to Darren Fletcher .

"Controversial: Naomi Wolf, 51, sparked fury on social media after questioning the authenticity of the ISIS beheading videos . Author Naomi Wolf has been accused of being 'disrespectful' after suggesting footage of hostages being beheaded by ISIS militants isn't real. The 51-year-old American writer made a series of controversial statements questioning the authenticity of the footage in a number of messages on her Facebook page. The initial post in which the feminist activist questions where the terror group are 'getting all these folks from' was deleted. In another post, she also said that the Obama administration was sending troops to West Africa to confront the Ebola outbreak so they could return with the deadly infection - justifying a military takeover of Africa. Social media users quickly rounded on her with some suggesting her theories were 'crazy' while others said her views were 'harmful' and had disrespected the victims' families. A video released on Friday appeared to show British hostage Alan Henning being beheaded by Jihadi John. He is the fourth person to have been brutally murdered at the hands of the extremists, and a fifth, former Army ranger Peter Kaggis, has been threatened as the next victim. After making the controversial statements over the weekend, Wolf defended her actions saying she was criticizing the reporting of the story - suggesting the video had not been properly confirmed by two sources. The post, that was later taken down, said: 'OK two of the hostages just happened to go from long careers into the military to... sudden humanitarian work (same was true of the latest British hostage). Where are they getting all these folks from? 'If someone is abducted there is a record with Amnesty and with Reporters without Borders. Can someone please confirm that these organizations have any record of this person having been abducted? 'The NYT (New York Times) yesterday ran a depressingly sloppy editorial claiming that all the ISIS beheading videos must be real because 'there are so many of them on youtube'. 'THAT's journalism? They also called ISIS 'evil' many times - which is not langauge of a news analysis, it is a theological category for some faiths and a Global War on Terror talking point... this may all be true but it takes five people to stage an event like this - two to be 'parents' - two to pose for the cameras... one in a ninja outfit... and one to contact the media that does not bother checking who ANY of these four other people are...' During the social media backlash, Mark Boothroyd said: 'Don't insult these people who have given their lives for humanitarian work. 'The activities of all these people have been well documented over the years. They are known people with families and friends who have supported them. Stop spreading conspiracy theories.' Scroll down for video . Anger: This post, which has since been deleted, from Naomi Wolf caused controversy, saying the video was staged and questioning where the hostages who have been executed came from . Retort: Following the post and the reaction on social media, Wolf clarified that ISIS are 'super bad' And Matt Hill added: 'A minimal amount of research would show you you're wrong – there's plenty of information out there about the hostages.' After noticing some of the responses, she took to her Facebook page again and wrote: 'I stand by what I wrote today: the videos of beheadings need to be independently confirmed before they are part of the historical record. They may well be completely accurate but there are not yet independent confirmations that they are accurate.' Another post said: 'A commentator below self-identified as being the New York Times reporter covering the hostage crisis. This reporter asked me to take my post about asking for confirmation of the hostage story down, as this reporter said that keeping it up is ""irresponsible"" and not respectful to the pain of the families involved. 'Once again to clarify. The reason I ask that media check and confirm a story like the series of videotaped beheadings of aid workers and journalists is that that is what journalists are supposed to do. It is sad and baffling to me that my post below reminding journalists to get two sources confirming information before they run stories repeating government talking points, is being interpreted as ""a conspiracy theory"".' She also condemned President Obama's decision to send troops to Western Africa to help combat the Ebola outbreak, suggesting the military will bring it back to the United States. She said: 'And...TV news in US reporting Department of Defense is sending three thousand troops to Liberia..troops with no medical expertise..to construct and run field hospitals for Ebola....then they will be quarantined for 21 days...and eventually come home. 'Disrespectful': One Twitter user reacted angrily to the statement suggesting the comments were 'horrible' Reaction: Canadian commentator Colby Cosh said Wolf had crossed over into 'baseless conspiracy theories' History: Another user referred to her past achievements when questioning her controversial views . 'A crazy idea as Liberia and Sierra Leone already have a dense infrastructure if medical aid organizations on the ground...many Western ones...that already have doctors nurses and well tested medical education networks that were activated to educate people about AIDs. I was in Freetown and witnessed this. 'What they don't have is enough doctors or supplies. They need the CDC not the Pentagon. So why send soldiers with no medical background? 'A. Militarized Africa has long been on the agenda but B. Three thousand Ebola-exposed American troops creates a direct vector into the US and whatever happens a narrative can exist to justify military condoning of US populations...quarantining Americans...emergency measures to limit travel...crisis best left to military not civil authorities. 'People in Liberia and Sierra Leone know perfectly well how to build more buildings for more beds..these are modern societies...they just need money. There is no practical reason to put our soldiers in the eye if ebola. That is why I dont (sic) like this narrative.'

Road accident victims could be offered an unusual therapy when they arrive at hospital: the computer game Tetris. As part of their treatment at the Emergency Department of John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, they will be asked to play the tile-matching puzzle within six hours of the accident. Researchers believe that the visual-spatial demands of the game will disrupt and prevent the forming of the mental imagery related to the accident in the long-term memory. This can lead to flashbacks associated with post traumatic stress disorder. The trial follows research at Oxford University where some volunteers watched a disturbing film and were then asked to play Tetris or take part in some other activity. The Tetris group had fewer flashbacks of the film than the others. Cafes and restaurants will have to provide clear information about allergenic ingredients in their food and drink from next week.

The Anaphylaxis Campaign, launched 20 years ago after the death of a teenage girl who ate a lemon meringue pie sprinkled with crushed peanuts in a cafe, has welcomed the new EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation. Cancer ad saves lives . Hundreds of lives have been saved thanks to an NHS drive to diagnose more cases of lung cancer. Some 3,000 extra referrals were made by GPs after an advertising campaign, Be Clear On Cancer, first ran from May to July 2012. It led to about 700 extra patients being diagnosed with the disease – 400 of them spotted at an early enough stage when treatment is more effective, and 300 who benefited from lifesaving surgery. The posters feature the message: ‘Been coughing for three weeks? Tell your doctor.’ The figures were published in the British Cancer Journal last week. Always wanted a bigger brain? Try meditating. Neuroscientists at Harvard discovered that the grey matter density of the hippocampus, the area of the brain connected to memory, learning, compassion, self-awareness and introspection, increased among those who meditated for just 27 minutes a day. They took part in an eight-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction Program (MBSR) with magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain taken before and after the programme. The meditation was done with the help of audio recordings.","Workout regime developed by the VS Angels' trainer available .

"Commuters and railway staff teamed up to free a man by rocking a train carriage to free his leg after he became trapped between the platform and a carriage on Wednesday morning. The man was boarding a rush hour train at Stirling station, 9km northwest of Perth, Western Australia, at 8.50am when he slipped and one leg became wedged in the gap. Quick-thinking passengers and staff saved the man's leg, as it was being squeezed by the 90-tonne of train, by collectively rocking the carriage. Scroll down for video . He was boarding a Perth-bound train at Stirling Station when he slipped and one leg became wedged in the gap . Quick-thinking passengers and staff pushed the 90-tonne train to help free his leg . 'He stood in the doorway and as he was sort of taking up his position there, one leg slipped outside the door, slipped outside the gap, and he was stuck,' Transperth spokesman David Hynes told the  ABC. 'We alerted the driver, made sure the train didn't move. 'Then our staff who were there at the time got the passengers, and there were lots of them, off the train, and organised them to sort of rock, tilt the train backwards away from the platform so they were able to get him out and rescue him.' The man was boarding the rush hour train when slipped into the crack to the horror of passengers . A number of passengers got off the train to help rail staff rock the train to help set the man free . An ambulance was called to the station but the man did not sustain any serious injuries. Mr Hynes said it was not a problem caused by overcrowding and praised the actions of staff and passengers who helped free the man. 'Everyone sort of pitched in. It was people power that saved someone from possibly quite serious injury,' he said. The man (circled) was helped away by a staff member so he could be treated by paramedics, as passengers re-boarded the train . Nicolas Taylor told Perth Now that he and fellow passengers got off the train and worked together to free the man by pushing against the carriage away from the platform. 'He seemed to be a bit sheepish, because right where he fell was the ‘mind the gap’ writing,' he said. Mr Taylor said Transperth staff coordinated the incident well, taking about 10 minutes to free him. 'They did a really good job, they took control and handled it well. When I first saw it I thought we’d be there for hours.' he said.","People power saved a commuter whose leg became wedged between the gap in Perth, Western Australia during rush hour .

"Ex-Everton boss David Moyes has been catching up with one of his former players over in America. The Scot, who left the Blues to replace Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United following 11 years service at Goodison Park, posed for a picture with former Everton talisman Tim Cahill, who is now playing in New York. Posting a picture of the pair on Instagram - which will bring back great memories for Evertonians - Cahill said on Friday evening: 'Amazing to catch up with a true gentleman of the game on and off the park. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tim Cahill, Matt Besler and more MLS All-Satrs play FootGolf (ARCHIVE) Ex-Everton boss David Moyes has been catching up with former Toffees talisman Tim Cahill in New York .

Moyes took Cahill to Everton in a £1.5million deal from Millwall during the summer of 2004 as the Toffees, tipped for relegation, went on to achieve the unthinkable by finishing fourth in the Aussie's debut season with the club. Everton finished fourth in Tim Cahill's debut season following his £1.5million move from Millwall in 2004 . Tim Cahill scored 56 goals in 226 Premier League appearances for Everton and was famed for his heading . Arguably one of the best in the air, the midfielder's aerial prowess petrified Premier League defences as Everton's  No 17 became famed for his headed goals.

"Andy Murray has pledged he will continue to represent Great Britain next year despite his shock backing for the Scottish referendum Yes campaign. Speaking exclusively to Sportsmail before the result of the vote was known, the former Wimbledon champion declared that he will definitely line up for GB when they take on the United States in the Davis Cup World Group first-round match in March. ‘I will be playing for Great Britain in the Davis Cup next year, that is for sure,’ he said. ‘As far as I’m concerned the vote doesn’t change anything in that regard.’ Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the union in an historic referendum on Thursday. Andy Murray has revealed that he will play for Great Britain in David Cup despite controversially declaring his support for the unsuccessful Yes campaign for Scottish independence . The British No 1 spent what could be an historic day practising on courts at Wimbledon . Judging by the reaction on social media to Murray’s backing for Scottish independence, the British public might not be so sure. The 27-year-old Scot was practising at the All England Club on Thursday afternoon, and expanded on his surprise tweet from the early hours in which he came out in favour of independence. He tweeted: ‘Huge day for Scotland today! No campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. Excited to see the outcome. Let’s do this!’ Murray has stated that he supports a 'Yes' vote in favour of Scotland gaining independence . Murray changes his shirt during the practice session while votes are being cast back home in Scotland . Thursday's Davis Cup draw gave Great Britain a plum home tie against America from March 6-8. The clash will be a re-match of this year’s first round in San Diego in which Murray led GB to victory. And the Scot attempted to reassure British fans that he is not about to turn his back on the team, whatever his preferences in the vote. ‘As far as I’m concerned the vote doesn’t change anything in that regard,’ he insisted. The issue of international representation is extremely complex in what is potentially an unprecedented situation, and Murray was unsure about what the future might hold in the event of a Yes vote. ‘There don’t seem to be a lot of answers about that, a lot of this is theoretical,’ he said. Murray explained the lead-up to his tweet, which came after spending the previous year determinedly refusing to commit himself about the independence issue.

Murray tweeted his support for the Yes campaign in the early hours of Thursday morning . ‘I’ve followed pretty much everything about it over the last two weeks, and especially in the last few days and that’s how I felt at the time,’ he said, before issuing an impassioned plea for Scots to act in solidarity whatever the outcome. ‘It’s not my decision, I can’t vote, it’s for the Scottish people to decide and I trust them to make the right decision,’ he said. ‘I will support whatever the outcome is. Regardless of how it goes I think it’s very important for everyone to come together and stick together afterwards.’ Murray came in for some fearful abuse on social media but clearly decided that was a price worth paying in order to express his feelings. Comments under the MailOnline article were less than supportive. Murray signs a Scottish flag during his homecoming parade in Dunblane in September 2012 .

"Petrol prices should be slashed by 7p a litre by Christmas to keep pace with plummeting oil prices, the RAC says today. The 'overdue cut' would bring pump prices down to 114p a litre and deliver some added festive cheer, it said. The RAC's own monitoring of fuel prices shows there is 'scope for the price of a litre of petrol to come down by more than 7p a litre'. The motoring company is urging retailers to lower fuel prices in the run up to Christmas (file image) Diesel should drop by nearly 6p, it added: 'This would bring the average price of a litre of petrol to 114p and diesel to 120p – prices last seen across the country in March 2010. ' The RAC said: 'We are urgently calling on fuel retailers to pass on further savings in the wholesale price brought about by the continued fall in world oil prices. 'This overdue cut would reduce the biggest cost of motoring just in time for Christmas. Currently, the average price of petrol stands at 120.84p, with diesel at 125.43p. At the start of the year petrol was 130.79p a litre and diesel was 138.24p. The motoring organisation said that in June this year a barrel of crude reached a 2014 high of $115.36 – and the highest price since September last year . But since then it has fallen dramatically and as of Thursday stood at $68.59 – a fall of $46.77 or nearly 60 per cent. The RAC said: 'While the falling oil price has been reflected at the pumps by retailers consistently reducing forecourt prices, the latest savings in the wholesale price need to be passed on quickly to demonstrate transparency. ' RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'The tumbling oil price, coupled with a pound that is still strong against the dollar, have led to a phenomenon that many motorists are pretty unfamiliar with – falling pump prices.' Tesco and Asda are among retailers lowering prices. Above, the costs of fuel in 2005 . He said the forecast 7p a litre reduction that retailers should be passing on 'is the biggest the RAC has seen in recent years.' Petrol began to come down from its record high of 142.48p a litre on 17 April 2012. Diesel hit its record high of 147.93p on 13 April 2012). Supermarkets such as Asda and Tesco have been driving with price cuts, prompting retailers nearby to follow suit. Mr Williams said: 'Retailers now have a very reasonable record on transparent pricing so we have no reason to believe that they will not pass on the savings in the wholesale price. 'We just urge them to do it sooner rather than later to make the point very clearly to motorists that they operate a fair pricing system. 'If they do, we could well see petrol pump prices fall by well over 7p a litre in the next few weeks and diesel by almost 6p a litre. 'With this kind of drop in the national average prices, motorists will no doubt see some very low petrol prices – perhaps under 110p a litre from retailers who pride themselves on having the lowest prices.' The RAC said that with petrol at 114p a litre motorists would be saving over £9 filling up an average 55-litre family car compared to the beginning of the year, with the cost falling from £71.93 down to £62.70. Diesel at 120p a litre would save drivers £10 per fill-up – down from £76.03 to £66. Mr Williams said: 'This will be very welcome news just in time for Christmas when household budgets are really stretched. It should also be another boost for business as it will lower operating costs substantially. ' But he warned: 'While motorists are enjoying much lower forecourt prices it's important to recognise that they will always be limited by fuel duty, which represents nearly 58p in every litre, and VAT which is charged on top, at around 20p a litre.' He said a driver filling up a 55-litre petrol car at 114p a litre would pay £62.70 of which £31.87p would be duty, £10.45 VAT and only £20.38 for the fuel itself. In the Autumn Statement Chancellor George Osborne also said he was freezing fuel duty 'to help hardworking people be more financially secure.' Motorway filling stations – accused by motoring groups and ministers of 'ripping off' drivers with sky high prices - will soon have to post their charges in advance on roadside poles so motorists can decide whether to drive on by for a cheaper deal elsewhere, the Government announced this week taking a leaf from the France where this is law. Transport Minister Robert Goodwill said: 'For too long drivers have been ripped off by petrol prices on motorways.' Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander warned recently : 'When the price of oil falls, the public have a right to expect pump prices to fall like a stone, not a feather.' He was acting on long-standing complaints of motoring groups that pump prices rise 'like a rocket' when oil costs go up, but fall 'like a feather' when they come down.","Petrol prices should be lowered to give drivers festive cheer, said RAC .

"American investment firm Cain Hoy claimed on Friday they were discussing a buy-out of Tottenham Hotspur.

Earlier on Friday the company released a statement that read: ‘Cain Hoy confirms that it is at the preliminary stages of assessing a cash offer for Tottenham Hotspur.

"Thousands of health workers began knocking on doors across Sierra Leone on Friday in search of hidden Ebola cases as the entire West African nation was locked down in their homes in an unprecedented effort to combat the deadly disease. Wooden tables lay empty at the capital's usually vibrant food markets. Police stood guard at roadblocks in this nation of six million people. This crumbling seaside capital, its streets normally crowded with bumper-to-bumper traffic, seemed like a ghost town. Health workers planned to give each household a bar of soap during neighborhood canvassing. Once a house is visited it is to be marked with a sticker. President Ernest Bai Koroma urged Sierra Leoneans to cooperate. 'The survival and dignity of each and every Sierra Leonean is at stake,' he said Thursday night in an address to the nation. The lockdown comes as six people were arrested in neighbouring Guinea for the deaths of eight people who were on an Ebola awareness campaign. Scroll down for video . Police are enforcing a strict lock-down in Freetown Sierra Leone as the government tries desperately to stop the spread of the killer virus during the deadly outbreak . President Ernest Bai Koroma announced the three-day lock down on movement, asking his people to respect the instruction stop the spread of the disease . Across the city, only a handful of people tried to pass through the roadblocks as teams of medics attempt to locate hidden cases of the disease . At least 562 people are believed to have died from Ebola since the virus came to Sierra Leone from neighbouring Guinea. It is believed that more than 2,600 people have died across west Africa since the current outbreak started. Authorities hope to find and isolate Ebola patients who have resisted going to health centers, often seen only as places to die. Some international health experts have warned there might not be enough beds at treatment centers for new patients found during the three-day lockdown which ends Sunday. UNICEF said the measure provides an opportunity to tell people how to protect themselves. 'If people don't have access to the right information, we need to bring life-saving messages to them, where they live, at their doorsteps,' said Roeland Monasch, UNICEF Representative in Sierra Leone. In a statement, the U.N. children's fund said the operation needs to be carried out 'in a sensitive and respectful manner.' Most seemed to be taking the order seriously, and there were no immediate reports of resistance to the lockdown. 'It will protect our country from this dangerous virus,' said Ishmail Bangura, a Freetown resident. 'Many of our people have died - nurses and doctors too - so if they ask us to stay home for three days, for me it not bad.' This woman in Monrovia, Sierra Leone is suspected of having Ebola and is being taken to the John F Kennedy treatment centre by specially trained nurses . The woman's clothes are covered in blood, which is highly infectious and is one of the reasons the government wants to identify all existing cases to control the spread . This unfortunate woman is too weak to walk and is being carried by the team of medics, one of whom has a large disinfectant spray  for cleaning infected surfaces . However during this first-ever Ebola outbreak in West Africa, some people have previously lashed out at health workers, accusing them of bringing the dreaded disease. Others don't believe it exists. Many villagers in rural Guinea have reacted with fear and panic when outsiders conducted awareness campaigns, and this week such an encounter resulted in deaths. A team of eight who were on a campaign to raise awareness for Ebola have been killed in the country. The government announced that six people have been arrested. The team, accompanied by journalists, had gone to the village of Womey on Tuesday. Another team dispatched to look for nine missing members discovered eight bodies, including those of three local journalists, a hospital administrator and several health officials, the government said. Only one of the missing - the son of a Womey deputy administrative official - was found alive and hiding in the area, the government statement said. More than 2,600 people have died across West Africa, with more than half the fatalities recorded in Liberia. Earlier this week, President Barack Obama pledged 3,000 troops and the first increased American military aid arrived in Liberia on Thursday, according to the U.S. Embassy there. The C-17 U.S. military aircraft brought a team of seven military personnel along with some equipment. An embassy statement said more supplies and personnel are expected in the coming days. In Freetown, only the odd person can be seen on the streets as three-day lock-down continues across the country . This shanty-town market area in Waterloo,Freetown should be packed with traders and shoppers but the area is almost deserted as residents obey the lock-down . Medics believe more than 560 people have died of Ebola in the current outbreak in Sierra Leone since the disease crossed the border from neighbouring Guinea . Meanwhile in Guinea, The National Post reports that eight health officials and journalists were murdered after they arrived in a village to educate the residents about how to avoid transmitting Ebola. The residents of Womey, Guinea, attacked the health workers with knives and rocks fearing that they were bringing the disease to their village.

"Vehicles carrying Western aid  to displaced families in Syria and Iraq are being forced to pay huge bribes to Islamic State militants, it has been claimed. In yet another revenue stream for the terrorists, checkpoints have been set up on key roads where trucks carrying food and medical supplies are stopped and forced to pay to continue their journey. The bribes are reportedly disguised as vague 'transportation costs' by those making the payments, in order not to raise attention to the fact huge sums of Western money are helping to fund the day-to-day running of ISIS' so-called caliphate in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Militant: Particular blackspots for ISIS checkpoints are the roads around the militants' strongholds in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, as well as a number of major highways in eastern Syria. Claims that ISIS is recouping vast sums of money from bribes paid by Western aid convoys came from an aid coordinator who spoke to The Daily Beast on condition of anonymity. 'The convoys have to be approved by ISIS and you have to pay them: the bribes are disguised and itemized as transportation costs,' he said, adding that the payments are made either by foreign or local non-governmental organizations, or by Turkish or Syrian transportation companies. Particular blackspots for ISIS checkpoints are the roads around the militants' strongholds in Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, as well as a number of major highways in eastern Syria. The aid coordinator also raised concerns that not enough is being done to ensure the supplies themselves do not fall in the terrorists' hands . He claims quantities of Western food and medicine have been used to help appease families living under ISIS' brutal oppression, with some also sold on the black market in eastern Syria. Checkpoints: ISIS militants are forcing vehicles carrying food and medical supplies in Syria and Iraq to pay to continue their journey unhindered . A key element in ISIS' propaganda campaign is the phony representation that the terror group can operate as an independent state. However despite their undoubted wealth, the estimated 35,000 fighters in control of up to four million mainly reluctant citizens are unable to produce anything like the steady flow of food and medical aid it requires to function. As no nation will openly do business with the terror group, despite an estimated £2billion war chest largely raised from oil production and smuggling, the militants are forced to resort to stealing supplies from Western convoys. It is claimed that, in order to allow the convoys to enter Syria and Iraq, ISIS insists on approving the staff list of transport companies. It also demands that each convoy has at least one militant assigned to oversee the operation and arrange prices with the group's religious leaders. 'We don't have to wrangle with individual ISIS field commanders once approval is given to get the convoy in, as the militants are highly hierarchical...none of the fighters will dare touch it,' an aid coordinator told the Daily Beast. An American journalist has been killed in a car crash in Turkey just days after claiming she claimed the Turkish intelligence services had threatened her over her reporting of the siege of Kobane. Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle'. Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying after one of her reports suggested ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the Syrian border in the back of aid vehicles. Tragic: Serena Shim, who worked for Iran's state-owned Press TV as Turkey correspondent, died in the city of Suruc after the car in which she was travelling reportedly collided with a 'heavy vehicle' Shim, an American citizen of Lebanese origin, had been working in Turkey for Press TV - the Iranian state-owned television network. In a report published on the company's website, it is claimed she had been in a rental car on the way back to her hotel in the town of Suruc in Urfa Province when the 'suspicious' accident took place. Neither the 'heavy vehicle' nor the driver involved in the crash have been located after the incident, Press TV claimed, adding that her parents 'refused to believe' the crash had been an accident and are planning to pursue the matter legally. Press TV's account of the crash has been somewhat disputed by Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News, however, who said the vehicle involved was a cement mixer and that the as-yet-unidentified driver had been arrested at the scene. Death: Serena Shim's death came just days after she spoke on camera of her fears of being arrested, claiming Turkish intelligence agents had accused her of spying . Only last Friday Shim was interviewed on camera by Press TV about her fears of being arrested by Turkish intelligence agencies. In the short interview she alleged that she had been approached and accused of spying after a report in which he said she claimed to have received images of Islamic State terrorists being smuggled over the Turkey-Syria in vehicles belonging to the World Food Organization and other aid groups.

Indigo Nowakowsky-Kaiuha suffers from Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome that affects only one in 15,000 children. Indigo has blown up to a staggering 25kg, meaning she no longer fits into her car seat, requiring a custom one to be made. The condition means that helpless child also suffers from a wide range of symptoms including restricted movement and breathing problems. She may also struggle to walk in the future. Indigo Nowakowsky-Kaiuha suffers from Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a rare overgrowth disorder . The disorder means Indigo has restricted movement and breathing problems . Indigo was diagnosed at four months old, after her weight started ballooning suddenly. When she was born, Indigo's health was seriously affected. The child had chronic fluid retention, a belly button hernia, enlarged organs and a heightened risk of cancer. ‘They did some blood tests and found she has Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. We’re waiting for further tests to find out if it was genetic or random,’ said her mother Tiffany Nowakowsky-Kaiuha. To make matters worse, Tiffany has suffered back injuries from looking after Indigo. The mounting financial burden of medical bills, clothing and caring for her daughter and her two other sons Shade, six, and Devon, four, is also putting huge pressure on the young family. The fact she outgrows at a rapid rate, mean the family is struggling badly financially. ‘The stress of not knowing if she will be able to walk or even crawl, the stress of the endless medical work and needing to buy new clothes all the time – it can be very overbearing,’ Tiffany said.

"'Just a small island no-one pays any attention to'... Russia's President Vladimir Putin, left, welcomes PM David Cameron at the start of the G20 summit today in St Petersburg . Russia dismissed Britain as ‘just a small island no one pays any attention to’ last night as a summit of world leaders descended into acrimony over planned military strikes on Syria. In an astonishing attack, Vladimir Putin mocked the UK’s size and influence, and boasted that Soviet oligarchs had ‘bought Chelsea’. However as controversy erupted, Russian officials flatly denied the remarks – attributed to President Putin’s official spokesman Dmitry Peskov – had ever been made. But the episode at the G20 summit hosted by Russia underlined the Cold War style tensions that have been created by the row over Syria. The seating plan at the talks has had to be changed so that Barack Obama and President Putin are kept as far apart as possible. Last night, arriving at the summit venue in St Petersburg, President Obama strode in alone rather than walking in with President Putin. The war of words with Britain came as David Cameron continued to make the case for intervention in Syria despite his defeat in Parliament last week. They represented an extraordinary breach of protocol, particularly as Russia is hosting the G20 meeting. President Putin, a belligerent ally of Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad, has been revelling in MPs rejection last week of British participation in US-led military action. But the Kremlin’s decision to rub Mr Cameron’s nose in it – with the Prime Minister on Russian soil – will plunge Anglo-Russian relations to a new low. Told of the Russian verdict on Britain, an infuriated Mr Cameron insisted: ‘I don’t accept that for a moment.’ A Downing Street source said: ‘As host of guests from the world’s leading countries, I’m sure the Russians will want to clarify these reported remarks, particularly at a G20 where it’s a very British agenda on trade and tax. ‘It highlights how a small island with great people can achieve a big footprint in the world.’ Chancellor George Osborne insisted Britain is 'setting the agenda' at the summit, on the humanitarian response to what’s happening in Syria, the economic agenda and the tax agenda. Glum: David Cameron looks downbeat as he sits through the early stages of the two-day G20 Summit in Constantine Palace in Strelna near St Petersburg . Down the hatch: With relations frosty, President Putin and Mr Cameron warm themselves as they arrived for the Water and Music Show . A British diplomat pointed out that the UK economy was significantly larger than Russia’s. There . was no sign at the summit that the latest evidence produced by the US . and the UK to back calls for action against Syria was winning over . doubters, with everyone from Iran’s supreme leader to the Pope opposing . intervention. President . Putin accused the US of ‘lying’ to justify missile strikes and attacked . Secretary of State John Kerry for denying that Al Qaeda was fighting . with the Syrian opposition. Mr Cameron attempted to win over opponents of military strikes on Damascus by unveiling new new evidence of the regime's use of chemical weapons. He also launched a provocative attack on those who had blocked British involvement in the planned operation. President Putin, a belligerent ally of Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad, is well aware of the rejection of British participation in US-led military action as voted against by MPs last week . All smiles: But the Kremlin's decision to rub Mr Cameron's nose in it, with the Prime Minister on Russian soil, will plunge Anglo-Russian relations to a new low . Arriving in St Petersburg, the Prime . Minister announced that scientists at Britain's Porton Down had . identified deadly sarin gas on victims' clothing and in soil samples . from Damascus. It also emerged that a report . prepared by US spy chiefs concluded that Syria possesses a 'longstanding . biological weapons program', on top of chemical weapons, and may have . access to anthrax, camelpox and cowpox. Taking 'full and personal . responsibility' for the Government's shock defeat over British . participation in military action last week, Mr Cameron insisted he had . taken a 'principled stand against the gassing of children'. Labour MPs - and those Tories and . Liberal Democrats who joined with them to oppose military action - would . have to 'live with the way that they voted', the Prime Minister said. Mr Cameron said he had agreed to all . the caveats Labour had asked for but 'even in spite of that, in my view, . they chose the easy and political path not the right and the difficult . path'. However, there was no sign that the . latest evidence produced by the US and the UK was winning over doubters - . with everyone from Iran's supreme leader to the Pope opposing the idea . of intervention. Host: Russia's President Vladimir Putin reads a statement during a round table meeting at the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg, Russia today . Opening speech: Russian President Vladimir Putin (in the centre of the picture) delivers his opening speech during the first working session of the G20 Summit in Constantine Palace in Strelna near St. Petersburg . Iran’s . supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claimed the US was using a . chemical attack in Syria’s civil war as a pretext to interfere in his . country. The head of Iran's elite Quds force, . Qassem Soleimani, went further, declaring that the Islamic Republic . would 'support Syria to the end'. Pope Francis also opposed action as . world leaders gathered in Russia, urging them to 'lay aside the futile . pursuit of a military solution'. Asked in TV . interviews whether he was ‘sidelined’ at the summit as a result of the . Commons vote, Mr Cameron said repeatedly: ‘I don’t accept that for a . moment. Mr Cameron said he had not seen ‘any evidence’ that Russia was prepared to shift position and endorse action through the UN. ‘Let’s . be clear: almost 100 years ago the world came together, Russia . included, to say after the First World War, the use of chemical weapons . wasn’t acceptable,’ he said. 'All the testing that's been done, including the testing we are doing at our Porton Down laboratories, all adds to the picture. 'But I don't think anyone is . seriously denying that a chemical weapons attack took place. I think the . Russians accept that. Even the Iranians accept that. 'The question is obviously convincing more people that the regime was responsible.' Talks: Mr Cameron was seated next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the working session of the G20, with US President Barack Obama (centre) and President Putin further round the table (right) Unable to take . part in military operations, Britain is instead offering an extra . £52million in aid for the millions of Syrians who have fled President . Assad’s forces, taking its total commitment to £400million. The Prime Minister said he had not seen 'any evidence', however, that Russia was prepared to shift and endorse action through the United Nations. But he added: 'I don't resile from the arguments I made last week - when America and many others in the world draw a red line over chemical weapons use, if nothing follows from that, that would be very bad for our world.' Mr Cameron said President Obama had been 'very understanding' over his defeat in Parliament. 'Like me he is a democrat who . believes you have to listen to people, you have to listen to Parliament . and you have to respect the outcome of a vote. 'Britain isn't going to be involved . in this specific military action, but the special relationship between . Britain and America is as strong today as it was a week ago,' the Prime . Minister said. Mr Cameron is also urging President . Putin to use his influence with the Syrian regime to strike an agreement . that neither side in the civil war should fire on humanitarian convoys. 'Every 15 seconds there is another . Syrian refugee. While we are sitting here in the comfort of St . Petersburg, thousands of people will be made homeless. 'They need tents, they need shelter, . they need food, they need protection from chemical weapons attacks,' the . Prime Minister said.

US President Barack Obama listens as Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during the start of the G20 Working Session . Host Vladimir Putin: Russia's President pictured at the G20 round table meeting in St. Petersburg . Asma al-Assad pictured on Instagram embracing an old woman . The Pope has condemned global leaders for refusing to find a diplomatic solution while a ‘senseless massacre’ unfolds in Syria. In a letter to Vladimir Putin as the Russian leader prepared to preside over the G20 summit, Francis wrote: ‘It is regrettable that, from the beginning of the conflict in Syria, one-sided interests have prevailed and in fact hindered the search for a solution that would have avoided the senseless massacre now unfolding. ‘The leaders of the G20 cannot remain indifferent to the dramatic situation of the beloved Syrian people which has lasted far too long and risks bringing even greater suffering to a region bitterly tested by strife and in need of peace. To the leaders present, to each and every one, I make a heartfelt appeal for them to find ways to overcome the conflicting positions and to lay aside the futile pursuit of a military solution.’ Yesterday foreign ambassadors were summoned to the Vatican to receive a briefing on the Pope’s position. But the diplomatic efforts by Francis stopped short of Pope John Paul II’s futile attempts to prevent the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Vatican denied claims that Francis had spoken to President Assad by telephone asking him to reduce attacks on rebels. Meanwhile Assad’s wife Asma has used social media to try to pretend that all is well in the country. On the Syrian presidency’s Instagram account, the first lady is pictured smiling as she hugs old women and ladles out soup to refugees alongside mobile kitchen volunteers. Critics say it shows British-born Mrs Assad has become a Marie Antoinette figure, out of touch with what is really going on. Some Instagram users accused her of ‘hypocrisy’ at being pictured caring for young people when tens of thousands of children have died in the two-year war.","Vladimir Putin mocked the UK's size and influence on the world stage .

"Jose Mourinho has been gagged again by Chelsea after Diego Costa was charged by the FA with violent conduct.

"More than a million callers failed to get through to a police hotline last year while some people were left waiting more than an hour to speak to someone about a crime. Shocking statistics revealed 1,071,939 calls to the non-emergency 101 phone number were abandoned or dropped in the last year, an increase of 26 per cent on the previous 12 months. New figures show that more than a quarter of people calling the lines in some areas either hung up or were cut off before they managed to speak to anyone with information about an incident. Statistics revealed 1,071,939 calls to the non-emergency 101 phone number were abandoned or dropped in the last year . The 101 number was introduced with a fanfare across Britain from 2011 to replace individual police station numbers and reduce the number of time-consuming 999 calls when something was not an emergency. The latest figures, gleaned from Freedom of Information answers, show the number of calls in the year to September fell by 113,640 to just over 41million. But only a few forces were achieving their own targets of answering 90 per cent of calls within 30 seconds. Elected crime tsars have branded the service is some parts of the UK ‘completely unacceptable’. John O'Connell, director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It was claimed the 101 line would save money and reduce pressure on the emergency services, but the service is simply not performing and the promised benefits won't appear as a result. 'Each call centre costs money, and right now taxpayers aren't seeing value for money. We need to improve 101 service significantly by finding inefficiencies in the system, or look at whether it is worth continuing.' Policing Minister Mike Penning said: ‘Police forces are responsible for ensuring 101 calls are answered' Sam Clayton, from Bradford, said he made several unsuccesful attempts to contact West Yorkshire Police on the 101 number when he saw a group of yobs stealing metal from his neighbour’s garden. He said: ‘I’d spent just over 60 minutes on hold. Then the call seemed to be answered, then I was cut off. It is extremely frustrating. I spent so long on hold. ‘It just leaves me wondering how many people are the victims of crime in that area who just give in.’ One person calling the line in Lancashire waited an hour and 18 minutes for an answer, while someone ringing Greater Manchester Police waited one hour nine minutes. The average time taken to answer a call to Sussex Police's 101 line in June was nearly four minutes, figures show. The police forces with the quickest average answer time were Wiltshire, North Wales, Lincolnshire, Essex and the City of London, where calls were typically picked up after seven seconds. Tony Hogg, the Devon and Cornwall Police and Crime Commissioner, claimed most people his area waited between 10 and 20 minutes before speaking to an operator, although the force said 93 per cent of calls were answered within 30 seconds. He said: ‘Most people are calling because they want to give some intelligence to the police, but how frustrating must it be not to be able to do that easily.’ Policing Minister Mike Penning said: ‘Police forces are responsible for ensuring 101 calls are answered within their local service standards. We are working with forces to support them to identify where improvements can be made.’","More than a quarter of people calling 101 hung up or were cut off .

"A grieving widower has touched the hearts of a village by leaving flowers every month at a bus stop where he met his beloved wife 64 years ago. Devoted husband Franco Gorno, 86, makes the 100-mile round-trip each month in memory of his late wife. Passers-by have been moved to tears by the poignant love letters left at the bus shelter with a bouquet of flowers. Franco Gorno, 86, pictured holding framed pictures of himself and late wife Joan at his house in Cardiff, travels to a bus shelter in Neath outside Victoria Gardens in south Wales, to place flowers at the spot where he first met Joan 64 years ago every month . His identity was a mystery - until Franco's family told of his love for wife Joan who he met at the village bus stop on a blind date. The bunch of beautiful purple tulips were discovered with a poignant letter telling his wife Joan: 'Rest in peace my darling. I'll see you soon.' Bus commuters were left teary-eyed when thy stopped to read the moving note at the bus stop in Neath, South Wales where the love-struck couple first set eyes on each other. The note, which was not signed and was discovered by a passer by, said: 'Joan, my beloved, passed away on 09/03/2013 and broke my heart for ever! Rest in peace my darling. I'll see you soon, I'll be 87 soon so I will not be long...God bless' Originally from Italy, Franco (pictured age 30) moved to Cardiff in 1950. He met Joan (pictured at 26) at the bus shelter in Neath after he was introduced to her by a close friend, two weeks before the Christmas of 1950 . It reads: 'Joan and I met right here in this shelter 2-3 weeks before Xmas 1950. We married two years after. 'Joan, my beloved, passed away on 9-3-2013 and broke my heart for ever! 'Rest in peace my darling. I'll see you soon, I'll be 87 soon so I will not be long...God Bless.' Grandfather-of-four Franco told how he makes the monthly trip in memory of Joan. Franco said of his 100-mile journey: 'I do it because I know she is up there looking down at me. It is quite a journey for me, don't forget I am 86' The pair married two years after they met at the bus stop, and they went on to have four children together. Franco was left heartbroken when Joan passed away last year . He said: 'Every month or so I go there and lay flowers because it is the place that I met her. 'I do it because I know she is up there looking down at me. It is quite a journey for me, don't forget I am 86.' Originally from Italy, Franco moved to Cardiff in 1950. He met Joan at the bus shelter in Neath after he was introduced to her by a close friend, two weeks before the Christmas of 1950. The pair were married two years later, and they went on to have four children together. Bus commuters were left teary-eyed when they read the poignant love note at a bus stop in Neath, South Wales (pictured, right, the order of service from Joan's funeral) But Franco was left heartbroken when Joan passed away last year. Grandaughter Joelle Gorno, 19, said: 'I knew they had met at the bus stop, he told me about it a few times. 'My grandad is a really sweet guy and really thoughtful.' Franco ran his own business in Cardiff called Gorno's Speciality Foods. One the people to be moved by Franco's romantic gesture was local resident Simon Watkins who found the flowers and note at the bus stop. He said: 'I went to the bus station and there was a bunch of tulips tied to one of the benches in the shelter with a note attached to it. 'It was such a poignant note and full of love for his wife.'

"How will you remember the 2014 Indians? Asked by Nasser Hussain to sum up the tour after their Twenty20 defeat at Edgbaston on Sunday, MS Dhoni settled for: ‘Overall, good.’ And, if you ignore the bad bits, he was spot on. Dhoni’s was the logic of the sportsman, for ever filleting away to pick out the negatives and serve up a dish that won’t stick in the gullet. India, you see, won a Test match at Lord’s and walked the one-day series. Three years ago in England, they failed to win an international game of any description. So, yes, it was a progress of sorts. But ‘overall, good’? In 2011, the margins of India’s four Test losses were 196 runs (Lord’s), 319 runs (Trent Bridge), an innings and 242 (Edgbaston), and an innings and eight (The Oval). This summer: 266 runs (the Ageas Bowl), an innings and 54 (Old Trafford), and an innings and 244 (The Oval). Spot the difference – if you can. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Morgan hails 'outstanding'  England . Still smiling: MS Dhoni (right) reflects on the end of India's tour alongside England T20 captain Eoin Morgan . Swashbuckling: Dhoni's heroics with the bat could not prevent a T20 defeat against England at Edgbaston . Familiar pose: Dhoni presided over another dreadful Test series away from home earlier in the summer . In 2011, the excuse was that India were dragged down by too many ageing stars, though it’s sobering to think how much worse they would have fared without the runs of Rahul Dravid. In 2014, Dhoni ended up pleading inexperience, which suggests something went badly wrong with the succession planning. Which tour was the more gruesome? Statistically, 2011: India lost the Tests 4-0 and the one-dayers 3-0 (plus the solitary Twenty20). But England back then were a better team. The side bounced out by Ishant Sharma at Lord’s in July was the most shambolic I’ve reported on in a decade and a half – even more so than the two sets of Ashes whitewashees. In 2011, England were preparing to become the No 1 Test team in the world. This summer, they were there for the taking. Their captain could not score a run, they had no spinner and no wins in 10 Tests. Bread and butter: India swatted England aside in the ODIs, which is Dhoni's favourite form of the game . Caught out: But Dhoni's lack of fight in Tests outside India was again exposed by England this summer . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin. The Top Spin is now taking a few weeks off before returning in time for England’s one-day visit to Sri Lanka in November. It was time for India to go for the jugular. And so, on the first day at Southampton, Dhoni sat back and invited England to nudge their way to 247 for 2. Pulse-racing it was not. But it allowed Alastair Cook and Gary Ballance to progress at a pace designed to ease England back into the series: no frills, no risks, just plenty of defensive fields and easy singles. It was red-ball cricket played with a white flag. As much as Ravindra Jadeja’s drop of Cook at third slip when he was 15 runs into his restorative 95, England were galvanised by the vibes emitted by Dhoni’s caution. There was no stopping them after that. Alternative: Virat Kohli has his critics, but the flamboyant batsman could be a the next Indian Test captain . Once that series was over, I asked Indian fans on Twitter whether victory in the one-day series would make up for defeats in the Tests. The overwhelming majority said it would not, which was one in the eye for those who claim Indian fans are damagingly obsessed with white-ball cricket. Yet it was the logic that appeared to inform Dhoni’s ‘overall, good’. He deserves some latitude: post-match interviews on podiums are not usually the forum for captains to reveal their darkest thoughts. But the whole edifice collapses if we don’t take at least some pronouncements at face value. For Dhoni, then, a 3-1 victory over an English one-day side which will continue to fall short of its potential while Cook is in charge was a face-saving balancing act to India’s 11 days of awfulness in the final three Tests. It is like a failing opera singer attempting to claw back credibility in the karaoke booth. It strikes this outsider that Indian cricket can do better. I don’t buy the argument that India try harder in one-day internationals than they do in Tests. Trying not very hard is the easiest accusation to make in sport – and the hardest to prove. But those grim tactics on the first day at the Ageas Bowl suggest the problem may nevertheless be a question of attitude. At home, Dhoni has won 21 Tests out of 30; away, it is six out of 28 (and three of those wins were in Bangladesh, New Zealand and the West Indies). Not all of this can be ascribed to the seaming ball. If Dhoni loses three of the four Tests in Australia later this year – who would bet against it? – he will become the most defeated captain away from home in the history of the game. With the quality of the batsmen at his disposal, this is a scandal. In truth, this tour hasn’t told us much we didn’t already know: Dhoni is a poor Test captain outside India, where he is too easily resigned to his fate, but a good one-day leader in any part of the world. His apologists say there is no alternative, though no-one seriously imagines Virat Kohli will endure a worse Test series than this one. It would also be a surprise if Kohli’s Test captaincy was as supine as Dhoni’s. Indian cricket won’t cure its away-day blues until Dhoni is asked to concentrate on his batting. It goes without saying he should continue as one-day captain, a format that evidently excites him. But India’s Test fortunes can hardly get any worse under a new leader. How will this column remember the 2014 Indians? Overall, predictable. THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . Boo boys . It’s always especially dim when spectators boo players. It was dim when English fans booed Ricky Ponting in 2009, and when they booed Ravindra Jadeja this summer. The best that could be said about both acts is that they were fuelled by the logic of the masses: Ponting was the captain of the arch-enemy, while Jadeja had been involved in a contretemps with Jimmy Anderson. But what of the recent booing aimed by Indian fans in the direction of Moeen Ali? What act had he committed, real or pantomime, that merited the derision? If there is a better explanation than his ethnicity, we’d be happy to hear it. Leave him alone: Moeen Ali was the subject of mindless booing from some supporters at Edgbaston . A glimpse into a soul . On Sunday, MS Dhoni turned down two singles in Chris Woakes’s final over – and India lost by three runs. If that sounds like a simplistic summation, then it may also provide an insight into Dhoni’s pre-eminence, both in his own dressing-room and, possibly, his own mind. Was a last-ball six off his bat really more likely than a last-ball four off the bat of the talented Ambati Rayudu? And what message did Dhoni’s I’ll-do-this-myself-thanks approach send to his team-mates? Still, as confirmation that cricket reveals the inner man better than any other sport, his decision was invaluable. Captain Morgan . Might Eoin Morgan’s return to pyrotechnical form at Edgbaston help England’s selectors see that their only chance of winning the World Cup will be to have exciting hitters all the way down the order? England made a very late change to the team that ended up winning the 2010 World Twenty20 in the Caribbean, drafting in Michael Lumb and Craig Kieswetter to open the batting in place of Jonathan Trott and Joe Denly. Since the World Cup will be preceded by a seven-match series in Sri Lanka and a triangular tournament in Australia, there is still time to thank Alastair Cook for his time and tell him to go away and rest up for 17 Tests in nine months. It may be England’s only chance. Something to shout about: Morgan's return to form with the bat is a big boost for England .

"Jose Mourinho believes that Diego Costa is 'not normal', as the striker’s blistering introduction to English football showed no sign of abating with a hat-trick against Swansea. The 25-year-old was superb on Saturday as the Blues dealt with an early scare from Garry Monk's impressive side to hold on to their impeccable Premier League record. It means that Costa now has a remarkable seven goals in four league games since his £32million move from Atletico Madrid in the summer and further enhances the belief that Chelsea came out of the transfer window as clear victors. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho praising Diego Costa's incredible goal scoring record . Diego Costa has hit the ground running with seven goals in his first four Premier League games . And manager Jose Mourinho is incredibly pleased with the impact of his signing since he joined . Mourinho was particularly chipper at the very deliberate ploy to wait on their man for over a year instead of plunging headfirst into the transfer market - even though they knew a striker was a priority. Costa now has more league goals than Fernando Torres managed in the entire of last term. ‘If the team plays well he has to score goals. Seven in four is maybe too much,’ the manager said after the 4-2 win. ‘It is something that is not normal. We cannot expect that after eight matches he will have 14 goals. ‘He is comfortable in the team. The team was built in a way that we were waiting for a certain type of striker and I think now everybody knows that Chelsea did the right thing in waiting for him and not going into the market in the summer of 2013 or January. ‘We waited for the right one.’ Sitting top of the Premier League, the picture looks rosy for Chelsea, who saw both Manchester City and Arsenal drop points earlier in the day. They are already five points clear of last season’s champions although Mourinho is wary of tricky fixtures straight after European ties in the coming months. Costa's first goal of the afternoon leveled the scores against Swansea . And the 25-year-old looked delighted as he netted his second to put Chelsea 2-1 up . Swansea keeper Lukasz Fabianski could do nothing as Costa netted Chelsea's third and his hat-trick . ‘We have fixtures that are like a poisoned gift for us, because every time we play in the Champions League the next match is against Man City, Arsenal, Man United or Liverpool. We have difficult weeks ahead of us.’ Wednesday’s home Champions League game against Schalke kicks Chelsea off in continental competition, with Mourinho insistent Group G is as tough as they come. Chelsea will also come up against Sporting Lisbon and Maribor and hope Didier Drogba will be fit for the opener. ‘The group is more difficult than people think,’ he added. ‘The Portuguese league is not strong, but the top three teams are very good. You go to Chelsea’s history and see when we played against Besiktas it was difficult and against Porto. ‘When we play Sporting it will be difficult. The Germans are Germans - Schalke have improved a lot on last season.’ Loic Remy replaced Costa in the second half to net on his Chelsea debut . And Cesc Fabregas was influential again as he assisted the first two goals of Costa's hat-trick .","Costa scores fantastic hat-trick as Chelsea beat Swansea 4-2 .

"Vodafone's terms and conditions says it will only pay out compensation for signal blackouts lasting 72 hours or more . Most of us know the pain of having a call cut off or waiting an age for a web page to load after losing mobile phone signal. But in order to claim compensation from phone companies, users are being asked to meet a bizarre list of criteria that includes losing signal for three days solid. In Vodafone's terms and conditions it says it will only pay out for signal blackouts lasting 72 hours or more, while T-Mobile asks user to prove that they lose signal at least seven times a day. The company demands that anyone seeking compensation send them logs of dropped calls, or pictures of the screen whenever they lose internet connection. Vodafone has around 19million customers, covering a quarter of the UK market, while T-Mobile, along with partners Orange, have around 31million customers. Network O2 said it does not have a fixed policy  and would treat each customer on a 'case-by-case' basis, while Three said it would offer a goodwill gesture, but refused to specify what this meant. The details of each company's policy are written into the terms and conditions of the contract that customers sign when buying the new phone. One of the most common reasons for a signal blackout is that a user has entered an area where wireless radio waves, transmitted by signal masts, cannot reach. This can either be because the mobile handset is too far from the nearest mast, or because a tall building has blocked the waves. However, issues with the handset can also cause a temporary loss of signal, as can overcrowding on a particular network or radio frequency, or interference from other devices. The research, carried out by The Daily Telegraph, comes just after Culture Secretary Sajid Javid announced plans for roaming networks. The details of each company's policy are written into the terms and conditions of the contract that customers sign when buying the new phone . This system would allow phone users in areas with poor mobile signal to automatically switch between providers if they find themselves cut off, as in foreign countries. The move is part of a government drive to eliminate mobile phone 'black spots', where no signal is available, which are especially common in rural parts of the country. Ministers have separately pledged £150million to build large numbers of new mobile phone masts. A spokesman forT-Mobile told the Telegraph that most issues with signal were faults with individual handsets, which were outside of its control. The spokesman said that if users can prove the issue is the fault of the mobile operator, it will offer a goodwill gesture on a case by case basis.","T-Mobile asks users to prove they have been cut off seven times a day .

"Fibre fan: Gabby credits potatoes for her slim waist . Sports presenter Gabby Logan has a refreshing diet tip for anyone who likes food: eat more potatoes – and bread. In an age when even the Chancellor George Osborne is said to starve himself for two days a week to keep slim, her stance seems rather radical. Yet the TV star claims her approach is the key to a trim waist, and swears she has never cut out food groups or gone hungry. ‘You hear about pop stars like Katy Perry or Miley Cyrus cutting out bread because of a gluten intolerance but they have a team of dedicated cooks,’ says the mother of two. ‘My worry is that celebrity stories lead to more people deciding to exclude key food groups from their diets without proper medical supervision, when that’s not the healthiest option. ‘I take real pride in giving my twins Reuben and Lois and my husband Kenny well-balanced, home-cooked meals where I know exactly what we’re eating, rather than choosing whatever option is more fashionable.’ And it seems she has a point. Last month, new research suggested that a third of Britons avoid wheat because fad diets warn against gluten, the protein contained in the grain – despite only two per cent of the population actually having an allergy. While experts believe some people might suffer mild intolerances that lead to bloating and stomach aches, this clearly isn’t a motivating factor in many cases. The survey also found that the majority of those who go wheat-free don’t actually know what gluten is. The main concern among health chiefs is that this approach is contributing to our already poor fibre intake. Medical guidelines recommend we consume at least 18g of this indigestible type of carbohydrate found in plants (abundantly in fruit, veg, beans, pulses and grains) a day. Without it our digestive system does not function properly. Studies show those people who eat lots of it are slimmer and have a lower risk of heart disease, cancers and diabetes. Yet the average Briton is said to consume just 14g a day. Having already lent her name to the British Heart Foundation-backed Flora ProActiv drive to promote heart health in women, Gabby is now working with Weetabix to try to get us to eat more fibre. She has altered her already admirable diet to include about 30g a day – the amount studies say protects against illness. That sounds a lot when you consider a slice of brown bread contains just 2g, but she didn’t feel she had to make massive changes. ‘Often it was a matter of eating jacket potatoes with the skin on, and making sure I had high-fibre snacks in between meals,’ says Gabby. ‘Oatcakes, which contain about 1.8g of fibre per biscuit, were a lifesaver, and endlessly versatile in terms of adding toppings. Houmous has 3g of fibre per 25g. A portion of beans – not just the baked variety, although they are great – will give you about 6g. ‘If you make sure you eat five portions of veg a day, and a couple of fruit, you’ll easily be getting 20g of fibre from those alone.’ Spuds-a-lots: Since increasing her daily fibre intake, sports presenter Gabby has felt the benefits . Although Gabby, 41, is fastidious about her health today, the former gymnast and daughter of Welsh international footballer and manager Terry Yorath has suffered her fair share of illness. Her sporting career ended due to sciatica, and she suffered a near-fatal haemorrhage in 2005 when she gave birth to her twins, now aged nine. And, of course, tragedy struck her family when her younger brother Daniel died of a sudden cardiac arrest in 1992, aged just 15, followed by her distraught father’s battle with the bottle. For these reasons, Gabby is never complacent about her own family’s health. Eating more fibre doesn’t have to mean munching through boxes of cardboard-like bran at breakfast. Here are a few foods that contain surprisingly high amounts: . ● Popcorn: 6.5g (150g portion) ● Dried figs: 2.9g (30g portion) ● Avocado: 5g (75g portion) ● Peas: 4.4g (80g portion) ● Blackberries: 4.2g (80g portion) ● Pear: 4g (150g, compared with 1.2g per 100g for apple) ● Sweetcorn, freshly cooked cob: 6.3g (125g portion) ● Onion: 3.3g (150g portion) ● Jacket potato with the skin on: 4.7g (180g portion) ● Oatcakes: 1.8g (per cake) ● Peanut butter: 1g (per tbsp) ‘However good you think your diet is, it’s dangerous to feel you’re fine – I know how easy it is to slip into bad eating habits, especially when you’re incredibly busy,’ she says. Since increasing her fibre intake, Gabby has felt the benefits. ‘I’d been feeling bloated, especially after breakfast, and then suffered energy slumps later in the day, both of which have gone now,’ she says. ‘My diet wasn’t problematic, but I knew it wasn’t perfect – it goes to show how you are what you eat. I’ve noticed my skin improve, too.’ Gabby has one concession to food fads. Every morning she blends her own ‘green drink’ from a variety of ingredients, including hemp, ginger, kale, sunflower seeds and bee pollen. ‘I might have that with some fruit, or add in half a wholemeal bagel with some peanut butter on, both of which are high in fibre. 'Then I might have a wholemeal fruit scone for a mid-morning snack, a handful or two of unsalted almonds mid-afternoon, or an oatcake with some goat’s cheese, and more fruit and water,’ she adds. Dietician Sian Porter advises anyone who wants to increase their fibre intake to do so gradually. She says: ‘Perhaps add 5g of fibre a day for a week, and then go up by another 5g each week until you hit the daily 30g target. 'You should also increase your water intake and the amount of exercise you’re doing, even if that’s just a short walk after meals. ‘It’s significant dietary change, so if you feel uncomfortable, slightly reduce your fibre intake for a few days before starting again, or see your GP if the problems persist, as a reaction to a high-fibre diet can be a sign of irritable bowel syndrome.’","Sports presenter Gabby Logan says: eat more potatoes and bread .

"Host commentator . And that's the final whistle at Upton Park as a Lionel Messi penalty hands Argentina victory against a spirited Croatia side. 91mins: Messi hits a 60-yard crossfield ball which Lamela collects, but a poor ball from the Spurs man see Croatia play the ball to safety. 88mins: Just a couple of minutes left at Upton Park as Argentina look set to stroll to victory. Perez swings in a corner which is eventually cleared before Tevez fouls Leovac to relieve the pressure. There will be three minutes so injury time. It's all over in Amsterdam as Vela returns from international exile with a brilliant double. Manchester United midfielder Blind also found the net after a stunning volley from Sneijder. 79mins: Messi's right-footed shot skims of the post after Pereira jinked through the Croatian defence. Unlucky. Half-time substitute Lukaku fires home a tap-in after good work from Mertens. 57mins: Tevez hasn't taken long to get into the game and has already stung the hands of Kalinic. The crowd have been cheering every time he gets the ball. Sami Mokbel: PA announcer has just described Tevez as a 'West Ham legend' #really? The Upton Park faithful are on their feet as former West Ham striker Carlos Tevez enters the action. He replaces Aguero. You just can't keep him quiet can you? Aguero is brought down by the Croatia keeper and the diminutive forward steps up to sweep the penalty home. Sami Mokbel: Second biggest cheer of the night has just happened. Carlos Tevez has just started his warm-up. All is forgiven in Mexico! Vela scores again in Amsterdam to put his side back in the lead. Aguero will claim it after Ansaldi's 25-yard strike deflects off the City forward. Croatia get the game back underway in east London. The players are back on the pitch for the second half at Upton Park. The good news for neutral fans is that Messi will not be substituted just yet... Does he ever score a bad goal? Sneijder has just volleyed his team level with a strike to match Vela's opener. Adnan Januzaj produced a fantastic assist to set up a Lombaerts goal only for the opener to be cancelled out just minutes later. 40mins: Messi eludes several challenges before a Perez cross is too long. Argentina have had most of the possession in this first half, but it's Croatia who have the goal. 34mins: A deep cross from Di Maria finds Ansaldi but his header is cleared. Just minuted later, Messi almost pulls Argentina level after a neat one-two with Ansaldi found the Barca star in space. Unfortunately, for perhaps everyone at Upton Park, Messi's shot hits the side-netting. 27mins: Messi and Aguero combine brilliantly on the edge of Croatia's box, but the assistant referee raises his flag just as the Manchester City striker curls a shot wide of goal. 19mins: Croatia are the team in control and have limited Argentina to shots from distance so far. Speaking of shots from distance, Aguero has just fired a brilliant 25-yard strike towards Kalinic's goal before Di Maria does exactly the same thing. The 6ft 7in keeper saves them both. Well the fans at Upton Park won't have expected that! It's Croatia that take the lead after a fine finish from Sharbini. 5mins: Five minutes in and Messi gets his first touches on the ball and you can hear the Upton Park crowd gasp in anticipation. The Barca forward picked up the ball on the edge of the Croatia box before over-hitting his pass. 3mins: Croatia start well and earn an early corner which is eventually cleared. Antolic picked up the loose ball and bombed down the right before seeing his cross cleared. We're underway at Upton Park and it's Argentina who start with the ball all in blue. That is a remarkable strike for the former Arsenal forward. It's been four years and five months since his last international goal and what a goal it was. Vela found space in the middle of the pitch before he rifled the ball home from 30-yards out with that brilliant left foot. 5mins: Mexico have started on the front-foot in Holland as Depay fouls Hernandez to give the away side a chance to swing in a free-kick. Vlaar cleared well. Chelsea winger Willian gets in on the act after a driving Neymar run caused panic in the Turkey defence - the ball eventually dribbled back to Willian who guided a low shot into the net. 42mins: Back in Istanbul and Brazil are looking extremely comfortable and lead by two goals. A curling effort from Turan is about as good as it's got for the Crescent-stars as Neymar and Co threaten to run riot. Messi, Di Maria and Aguero all start for Argentina at Upton Park and Tevez has to settle for a place on the bench. Argentina team vs Croatia: Romero; Zabaleta, Fazio, Vergini, Ansaldi; Perez, Mascherano, Banega; Messi, Aguero, Di Maria . 28mins: Alves pulls off a brilliant save from a curling Turan strike which looked destined for the top corner. The home side have rarely look like threatening, but that was a chance. Norway: Nyland, Elabdellaoui, Nordtveit, Forren, Hogli, Skjelbred, Konradsen, Daehli, Johansen, Elyounoussi, Nielsen. Subs: Jarstein, Hagen, Reginiussen, Singh, Odegaard, Soderlund,Samuelsen, Flo, Linnes, Gulbrandsen, Helland, Grytebust.

Subs: Pareiko, Lindpere, Barengrub, Kruglov, Subbotin, Hannes Anier, Teever,Vunk, Henri Anier, Jaager, Kams, Londak. Referee: Martin Hansson (Sweden) Unfortunately, Adriano is made to wait for his debut goal as the goal is given to Turkey defender Semih Kaya, who turned Willian's cross into his own net. Brazil double their lead and it's debutant Adriano who finds the net. We have a first goal of the evening and it's Neymar who puts Brazil ahead. The Barcelona forward found himself one on one with Demirel and finished with ease despite some pressure from the last defender. Holland team to play Mexico: Krul, VanRhijn, Veltman, Vlaar, Willems, Afellay, Sneijder, Blind, Robben, Huntelaar, Depay . Mexico team to play Holland: Ochoa, Aguilar, Reyes, M.Herrera, Alanis, Aldrete, Vazquez, H.Herrera, Guardado, Vela, Hernandez . 13mins: Bekir whips in a dangerous cross as Turkey start to impose themselves slightly, but Filipe Luis is able to get a strong header on the ball to clear. 9mins: Chelsea midfielder Oscar looks to have carried his Premier League form with him to Istanbul and has just been involved in Brazil's best move of the game. He played a neat one-two with Neymar in the centre of the pitch before cutting in and firing a powerful shot towards Volkan Demirel who saved well. 5mins: Turkey's first attack comes after a brilliant run for Hamit on the right, who jinked inside Filipe Luis before seeing the ball run into Diego Alves's arms. 3mins: Willian has been in the thick of the action already, drawing a couple of fouls early on as his looks to cut inside. Brazil, as you'd expect have been in total control so far... We're underway in Istanbul as Turkey look to claim a famous result against Dunga's Brazil. Brazil, in yellow and blue, get us underway. Lionel Messi warmed up for Wednesday's clash against Croatia in a training ground game against West Ham's Under 21 side. But the elements battered the Barcelona superstar as a strong Argentina side were put through their paces at the Hammers' wet and windy Rush Green Academy base in Essex on Tuesday evening.

"Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney was surprisingly the fastest player on the home side during the win over Queens Park Rangers. Argentina speed merchant Angel di Maria was bought for £60million to add an injection of pace but it was the skipper who clocked the quickest sprint on Sunday. Rooney reached a top speed of 20.3 miles per hour when attempting to out-sprint former United centre back Rio Ferdinand, who was making his first return to Old Trafford since leaving the club in the summer.

(Stats courtesy of Opta) The 28-year-old netted one of United's goals as they comfortably saw off Harry Redknapp's men 4-0 at Old Trafford. British record signing Di Maria, who cost £60m from Real Madrid, was a close second (20.1mph), followed by Antonio Valencia (20.0mph) and Jonny Evans, who finds himself joint third-fastest. Falcao's quickest sprint was just 17.9mph during his 23 minutes on the pitch, while Daley Blind (18.9mph) and Herrera (18.3mph) were ninth and tenth fastest respectively. The final summer signing on display, Marcos Rojo, slotted in nicely at the back for United - reaching a top speed of 19.1mph. Radamel Falcao's fastest sprint during his debut for Manchester United against QPR was just 17.9mph . Ander Herrera scored his first Manchester United goal against QPR and also covered the most distance . Daley Blind enjoyed a fantastic debut for Manchester United, controlling player and covering 7.4 miles . Marcos Rojo takes control of the ball for Manchester United as he covered an impressive 7.1 miles vs QPR . Jonny Evans recorded the joint-third fastest sprint for Manchester United in their 4-0 victory over QPR . Interestingly, however, Herrera and Blind covered the most ground for United on Sunday - highlighting how important they can be to Van Gaal's side. Blind enjoyed a stellar performance, running a total of 7.4 miles (11,854.8 metres), yet Herrera covered even more ground. The Spaniard, signed for £29m from Athletic Bilbao, ran an astonishing 7.6 miles (12,163.1m) - more than 10 per cent of the whole team's distance covered of 72.3 miles. Rojo (7.1 miles) and Rooney (6.9 miles) also worked extremely hard for Van Gaal, with Tyler Blackett and Evans (6.5 miles each) covering the least distance of the men who played 90 minutes, highlighting just how little they were forced to do defensively by the visiting side.

"Rail commuters face above-inflation fare rises in the New Year – with many season tickets crashing through the £5,000 barrier. The increase across all types of tickets averages 2.2 per cent. But season tickets are going up by 2.5 per cent – not only well above the Consumer Prices Index inflation figure but also in excess of most annual pay rises. Furious passengers, transport campaigners and union leaders called for an end to rail fare ‘rip-offs’ at a time of overcrowded ‘cattle class’ carriages and poor punctuality. Experts calculated that many fares have risen three times faster than wages during the lifetime of this Parliament. The new fares take effect on January 2. Among passengers who will have to pay more than £5,000 for an annual season ticket to London are commuters from Kent towns such as Tunbridge Wells and Ashford. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which announced the rises, said they were the lowest for five years and insisted that cash from fares helped maintain the service – but passengers were unconvinced and vented their fury. Samantha Ovens, an artist from London, asked on Twitter if there was ‘any justification for a further increase in rail fares’ when we have ‘the most expensive travel service in Europe’. Dawn Foster, from Liverpool, wrote: ‘Rail fares going up again in January, let’s hope you get your trains updated soon.’ Garry Clayton said that despite the rises it ‘will still be standing room only for the Wigan to Manchester train’. Tory MP Dominic Raab has voiced his anger as a crushed passenger on the 7.32am Woking to Waterloo service, which was named Britain’s most crowded commuter train service. He said his constituents were paying ‘for the privilege of travelling at one grade below cattle class’. Under the latest price rise, they will now pay more than £3,000 for their season ticket. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: ‘The scandal of Britain’s great rail fares rip-off is that today’s hike is far outstripping average pay increases. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said rail fares were a 'rip off' and a 'scandal' ‘The British people pay some of the highest fares in Europe to travel on clapped-out, understaffed and overcrowded services while the private train companies are laughing all the way to the bank. Today’s announcement fuels that scandal.’ Martin Abrams of the Campaign for Better Transport said: ‘During this Parliament, many fares have risen three times faster than wages, putting enormous strain on household budgets.’ RDG director general Michael Roberts defended the rise by saying: ‘For every £1 spent on fares, 97p goes on track, train, staff and other costs while 3p goes in profits earned by train companies for running services on Europe’s fastest growing railway.’ Rail Minister Claire Perry said: ‘Passengers are rightly concerned about the cost and complexity of fares. That is why last year we announced a real-terms freeze on regulated fares for the firsttime in a decade and this continues into 2015. ‘As a further measure we have asked operators to improve the information passengers receive when buying a ticket.’ Labour’s transport spokesman Lilian Greenwood said: ‘David Cameron has failed to stand up for working people struggling with the cost-of-living crisis, allowing the cost of some season tickets to rise by over 30per cent since 2010 – forcing people to pay thousands of pounds more to sit or stand on increasingly overcrowded trains.’","Rail commuters are facing above-inflation fare rises in the New Year .

"At least one of 43 college students missing since September has been identified among charred remains found near a garbage dump, two Mexican officials revealed. Tests carried out by teams in Argentina and Austria allegedly confirmed the body parts as those of trainee teacher Alexander Mora. He is believed to be one of the men captured  and murdered on September 26 in Iguala, Mexico, in an apparent bid by the mayor to prevent them from interrupting his wife's speech nearby. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Breakthrough? Mexican officials reveal a forensics team has identified the remains of Alexander Mora . Jose Luis Abarca, left and his wife Maria de Los Angeles Pineda are accused of ordering the killing . Edith Mora sobs after learning that her brother Alexander Mora, has now been positively identified among charred remains found near a garbage dump . Ezequiel Mora (right_ father of Alexander Mora, views a memorial to his son - who was murdered by gangsters in September . The two officers could not provide more details on how many of the students might have been identified. They agreed to speak only if granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The families were given that information late Friday by an Argentine team of forensic experts working on behalf of the relatives and with the Attorney General's Office, said the relative, who also would speak only on condition of anonymity. The teeth and bones were sent for testing at a laboratory in Austria, where the identification was made. They were so badly burned, many turned to dust when touched. But officials would not confirm that, and members of the Argentine forensic team could not be reached. The students went missing September 26 after confrontations with police in Iguala, in southern Guerrero state, that killed three students and three bystanders. The attorney general has said they were attacked by police on orders of Iguala's former mayor, Jose Luis Abarca, who has since been detained. Tests: Teeth and bones were sent to a laboratory in Austria which confirmed the identification of one man . Investigation: Mexican officials have been searching Iguala, Guerrero, to uncover numerous mass graves . Abarca and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda were finally captured after authorities found them in Mexico City, Jose Ramon Salinas, spokesman for federal police, said on his Twitter account. Maria de los Angeles Pineda is said to be the 'key operator' of crime in the town according to the Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) cartel. It said that as she was about to deliver a speech on Iguala's plaza in which she would put the case for succeeding her husband forward, she was told that a group of students planned to disrupt proceedings. To stop this happening, the attorney general said, she ordered the police to deal with them. Outrage: Demonstrators take part in a protest in Guadalajara city on December 1, demanding justice in the case of the 43 students that went missing in Iguala, Guerrero state, last September 26 . Victims: The above poster shows the 43 missing students and offers a reward for their recovery more than ten weeks after the trainee teachers vanished after being taken into police custody . Police then allegedly opened fire on the students after they stopped the buses they were travelling in, killing several, and driving others away on the orders of Guerreros Unidos' chief hitman, 'Chucky'. She was able to issue these instructions because she is apparently at the top of the criminal underworld tree in Iguala. According to Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam, the cartel's leader, Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado, describes her as 'the main operator of criminal activities in Iguala'. Forensic experts have combed through 11 clandestine graves discovered in the area during the hunt for the students. Detainees have told officials that they burned the 43 bodies at a dump site and bagged and scattered their ashes in a river. Authorities have detained more than 70 people in the case. The case has ignited citizen indignation across Mexico and abroad for the fact that the students disappeared at the hands of a corrupt local government and that federal authorities took 10 days to intervene. Tens of thousands have taken to the streets, some calling for President Enrique Pena Nieto to resign. The case has come to signify the abuse of authority and corruption that is engrained in the Mexican systems and that all Mexicans experience on a regular basis. Another demonstration was being held Saturday, where parents of missing students were expected to speak about the identification.","Argentine forensics team working for relatives identified Alexander Mora .

"We all know that panic-stricken moment. You drop your mobile and watch, aghast, as it plunges towards the floor, fearing it will land screen-side down – with shattering consequences. But now Apple plans to spare you that agony, with an invention that will stop your iPhone hitting the ground face-first. The technology giant was granted a patent last week on an invention that can detect when a handset is falling – and flips it to ensure the screen doesn’t hit the ground. The idea could also work with iPads and other devices. Apple was granted a patent last week for the invention that shifts an internal weight in the device in mid-air so it doesn't hit the ground face first on impact. Industry experts point out that a prototype has yet to be tested . Apple’s design features on-board sensors that measure the speed that the phone is falling and predict when it will land and which side of the device will hit the floor. If sensors calculate a delicate component, such as the screen or camera, will hit the ground, a motor is instantly activated within the phone. This moves an internal weight fast enough to affect the ‘rotational velocity’ of the device and spin it around as it falls, so that it lands on a reinforced area. The effect is similar to how a falling cat always manages to land on its feet. And that’s not all. The patent even includes a system that would eject the headphone cord to avoid damage to the connector. Victor Seidel, a lecturer in science entrepreneurship at Oxford University, said: ‘This does what a lot of successful innovations do: combines ideas in a way others had not considered, such as adding gyroscopic action within a smartphone. ‘But integrating this idea into current slimline designs may be a challenge. Of course, no one will really know the possible benefits and limitations until Apple gets prototypes into the hands of users – hands that are indeed sometimes clumsy.’ Industry insiders say an iPhone featuring the new technology may appear within three years.","Sensors predict speed of device in mid-air so it doesn't hit ground face first .

"Defendant: Shaun Whitt (above) has been charged with sexual battery on a victim younger than 12-years-old . A teenager spent an emotional two hours on the stand yesterday as she testified against her accused rapist in a Florida courtroom. Shaun White, 32, of Palm Coast, Florida, is accused of sexually assaulting the young girl in her home while her mother was at work, starting when she was just 11-years-old. Whitt was also dating the girl's mother at the time. The now 14-year-old, who cried through most of her testimony, told the six member jury, 'I didn't want to believe it happened to me.' Most of the abuse happened on her bedroom floor she revealed, starting in December of 2010 . At the time, she had just turned 11-years-old. Her mother was always at work when the abuse occurred. According to The Daytona Beach News-Journal, the young girl testified in the Bunnell, Florida courtroom that Whitt would tell her to take off her clothes and lie down, then he would strip off his clothes and rape her while she remained completely silent. 'There was no one to scream for,' she said. 'I didn't want him to see me cry.' The abuse happened 'frequently and often' according to Assistant State Attorney Christina Opsahl. The young girl built up the courage to write a note about the abuse in early 2012 and gave it to one of her teachers at school. Whitt was picked up by officials at his home shortly thereafter on charges of sexual battery on a victim younger than 12-years-old. Arrested: Whitt was picked up at his home in Palm Coast, Florida (above), after the young girl built up the courage to write a letter telling one of her teachers about the years of sexual abuse she had suffered . A medical exam performed after the girl made her report showed that the she had been sexually battered, and carpet samples taken from her room included Whitt's DNA. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted. Closing arguments are expected to be heard today.","A 14-year-old girl spent two hours on the stand yesterday in Bunnell, Florida testifying against her accused rapist .

"The Royal Navy has escorted a  squadron of Russian warships sailing through the English Channel. Four ships passed through the through the Strait of Dover after carrying out military exercises in the North Sea. HMS Tyne, a Type 45 Destroyer and one of the Royal Navy's most technically advanced warships, was able to pinpoint and monitor the movement of the group led by Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov as it approached the UK. Scroll down for video . This Ministry of Defence pictures taken from HMS Tyne shows a Russian supply vessel in the Channel .

The Russian navy anti-submarine ship Severomorsk (BPK 619) was also among the group sailing along the Channel (library photo) The Ministry of Defence stressed that it was in accordance with international law, but comes at a time of heightened tension between Britain and Russia. David Cameron has insisted he does not want a 'confrontational relationship' but has warned of further sanctions against Moscow if it fails to back in Ukraine. Russian destroyer Severomorsk, a landing craft, a rescue tugboat and a tank ship  anchored in the Bay of the Seine, off the coast of northern France, to wait out a storm, according to a Russian defence ministry statement reported by local news agencies. The Royal Navy was aware of the ships' presence and HMS Tyne monitored and escorted the squadron as it moved from the North Sea on Tuesday down through the Strait of Dover, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. Patrol ship HMS Tyne finished shadowing the Russian vessels after they passed out of the UK's area of responsibility into the French zone. It is understood that the Russian vessels complied with all  maritime  reporting regulations and defence sources said they expected the ships to head to the Mediterranean. An MoD spokesman said:  'We are aware that four Russian naval ships have passed through the Dover Strait from the North Sea into the English Channel, which all ships have the right to do under international law. 'The ships were escorted by the Royal Navy warship HMS Tyne as part of her UK maritime security role and have now left UK waters.' A naval source told the Telegraph: 'It's not provocative but we are keeping an eye on them.' Prime Minister David Cameron has insisted he does not want a 'confrontational relationship' with Russia, but has warned Vladimir Putin he must back down in Ukraine . The Russians ships' presence comes at a time of heightened tension between Moscow and the West and follows a G20 summit at which Vladimir Putin came under international pressure over the Ukraine crisis. France's president Francois Hollande this week suspended the planned delivery of a warship to Russia, citing the 'current situation' in eastern Ukraine. The Vladivostok, the first of two Mistral-class helicopter carriers ordered by Russia, was due to be delivered as part of a controversial 1.2 billion euro (£950 million) contract. It is not unusual for Russian ships to pass through the English Channel but they are usually monitored by Royal Navy vessels as they do so. In May a  Russian aircraft carrier and a nuclear-powered battle cruiser passed through the English Channel as part of a seven-strong task group, with Royal Navy destroyer HMS Dragon tracking their movements.","Four Russia ships passed through the through the Strait of Dover .

"It says much about how far Exeter Chiefs have come as a club that Rob Baxter’s men entered this game expecting to beat a team who have won the Premiership three times in the past five years. In the end, as on so many occasions last season, the Chiefs were a match in every department except the one that matters — the scoreboard — for a visiting side stacked with international talent. If Sam Hill had not narrowly knocked on Ian Whitten’s inside pass with the line beckoning 16 minutes from time, the result may have been different. Freddie Burns of Leicester Tigers calls a move during the Aviva Premiership match against Exeter Chiefs, with Burns scoring three penalties during the clash at Sandy Park . Anthony Allen of Leicester Tigers collects a kick through to score his side's opening try at Sandy Park . If the Chiefs had opted to kick a penalty at goal with time on the clock, the result may have been different. If flanker Dave Ewers had not been sin-binned by referee JP Doyle five minutes from time — gifting Leicester another three points — the result might have been different. But ‘ifs’ don’t deliver Aviva Premiership wins and ultimately, yet again, a young Chiefs side were not quite street smart enough to close out victory against one of the best in the business. ‘We were one moment away from beating a good Leicester side,’ said Baxter, Exeter’s director of rugby. ‘If Sam Hill had held on to the ball, we win by a point, we would be sitting here delighted with a performance with a lot of endeavour about it and we’d have scored some good tries. ‘I try not to get too carried away when a game does come down to one or two moments because there’s no value in that. But the lads will know where we lost that game. We lost composure at key times.’ With £10million spent redeveloping Sandy Park by the upwardly mobile Chiefs ahead of next year’s World Cup, there were high hopes around the ground at kick-off. But, just as parts of the stadium remain a work in progress, so do elements of Baxter’s team. Henry Slade, 21, played out of position at outside centre but proved more than a match for Manu Tuilagi and clearly has a very big future, while inside centre Hill is rough, tough and direct. Exeter Chiefs' Gareth Steenson is tackled by Leicester Tigers' Manusamoa Tuilagi in the  Premiership clash . There are also high-calibre players to return. England wing Jack Nowell has recovered from knee surgery and will play in an A league game against Harlequins on Monday night, while highly rated hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie is also expected to play again within a month to bolster a creaking Chiefs line-out. But, at the moment, they do not possess the killer instinct to attack the jugular of the Premiership’s biggest beasts. Baxter said: ‘You can’t buy experience and we have guys out there who are learning minute by minute. We are going to have to take some pain but we’ll reap the rewards.’ Ewers and Haydn Thomas scored Exeter’s tries, while Gareth Steenson kicked 10 points, but they allowed a 17-10 lead just before half-time to slip as Tigers fly-half Freddie Burns — signed to replace Toby Flood — became an increasingly influential figure in the match. Burns, impressive in New Zealand for England this summer after a disastrous final season at Gloucester, kicked four out of five kicks at goal and set up Anthony Allen’s first-half try with a neat grubber kick into the in-goal area. Leicester Tigers' Geoff Parling (front left) gestures to the referee as Exeter Chiefs' Haydn Thomas (centre) celebrates with his team mates after he dives over to score their side's second try . It was, according to his scrum-half partner Ben Youngs, a ‘faultless performance’. ‘Freddie wouldn’t be Freddie without the odd maverick moment,’ said Youngs, who scored Leicester’s second try after 57 minutes. ‘But he knows he needs to be consistent and he has produced two faultless performances in his first two games for the club. He’s got a big match against (England rival) George Ford when we play Bath next week.’ Tigers boss Richard Cockerill opted to keep Tom Croft on the sidelines following the stinger injury he suffered in pre-season, insisting he will be in the match-day 23 to face Bath, and he left Sandy Park satisfied with his side’s second win out of two this season. ‘Sides will get beaten here who will be in and around us at the end of the season,’ Cockerill said. ‘Both sides had guys missing but that was a good win on the road. Freddie is working really hard. Sometimes he will get it right, sometimes he won’t — but I was happy with him today.’","Three Freddie Burns penalties help Leicester Tigers to 24-20 win at Exeter .

It's reported the victim had recently moved to Cairns for work, and had been  returning to Napier every three months to be with his wife and children. Cairns Regional Crime Coordinator Detective Inspector Bruno Asnicar says information received about seven days ago led detectives to believe the dead man may have been missing and had possibly met with foul play. 'It's important to remember that he wasn't reported missing,' he told reporters in Cairns on Thursday. 'We believed there were some suspicious circumstances around the potential this guy might be missing and we've launched it from there.'

"An Islamic State plot for sword-wielding fanatics to behead victims selected at random on the streets has been thwarted by police in Australia. The plot – with chilling echoes of the murder of soldier Lee Rigby, who was hacked to death on a London street last year by two Muslim converts – was foiled in a series of anti-terror raids across Sydney. Some 800 heavily armed officers arrested 15 suspected IS supporters and seized an Islamic sword, a dagger and guns. Scroll down for video . Australian Federal Police swooped on the suspected terrorists where they recovered a large sword, pictured . Federal Police arrested 15 people after it emerged at least 60 Australians are fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq . Intelligence from telephone intercepts indicated a senior IS leader had ordered the group’s supporters to carry out the attacks, picking victims at random, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed. ‘The exhortations – quite direct exhortations – were coming from an Australian who is apparently quite senior in IS to networks of support back in Australia to conduct demonstration killings here in this country,’ he said. At least 60 Australians are said to be fighting for IS in Syria and Iraq, with at least 15 having been killed. Mr Abbott has sent 600 troops to the Middle East, together with warplanes to be on stand-by to attack the jihadis. Last month there was international shock and disgust when a seven-year-old boy, raised in the suburbs of Sydney, was shown in Syria holding a severed head. The raids came days after Australia raised its terrorism threat to the second-highest level in response to the domestic threat posed by IS supporters. Attorney General George Brandis confirmed that a person born in Afghanistan who had spent time in Australia and is now working with IS in the Middle East ordered supporters in Australia to behead people and videotape the executions. ‘If the... police had not acted, there is a likelihood that this would have happened,’ Mr Brandis said. Mr Abbott added: ‘This is not just suspicion, this is intent and that’s why the police and security agencies decided to act in the way they have.’ Among the weapons recovered from the suspected terrorists is this military-style survival knife . The suspects have been taken into custody while their terrorist connections are fully investigated . Court documents named the mastermind of the attack as Mohammad Ali Baryalei, 33, a former nightclub bouncer, who is believed to be Australia’s most senior IS member. Omarjan Azari, 22, one of those held, appeared briefly in court hours after his arrest. Prosecutor Michael Allnutt said Azari was involved in a plan to ‘gruesomely’ kill a randomly selected person – something that was ‘clearly designed to shock and horrify’ the public. That plan involved an ‘unusual level of fanaticism’, he said. Azari is charged with conspiracy to prepare for a terrorist attack. In court documents, Azari was accused of conspiring with Baryalei and others between May and September. Mr Allnutt said the charge stemmed from the interception of a phone call days earlier. Azari will appear in court again in November. Dozens of police spent yesterday searching Azari’s house and a car parked across the street. Australian Security Intelligence Organisation director-general David Irvine said the threat of terrorism in the country had been rising over the past year, mainly due to Australians joining IS to fight in Syria and Iraq. ‘Police believe that this group that we have executed this operation on today had the intention and had started to carry out planning to commit violent acts here in Australia,’ said Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Andrew Colvin. ‘Those violent acts particularly related to random acts against members of the public.’ Terror raids were conducted in the cities of Brisbane and Logan in Queensland yesterday in a follow-up to operations carried out last week. Then, police arrested two men in Brisbane for allegedly preparing to fight in Syria, recruiting jihadis and raising money for the Al Qaeda offshoot group Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front. Police said the operations in Sydney and Brisbane – venue for the G20 summit of world leaders in November – were linked, but declined to release details.

And Kris Commons secured the points right at the start of the second half with a shot that deflected off Shaleum Logan and into the net. Celtic were the dominant side and Commons twice went close while debutant Stefan Scepovic had a first half goal chalked off for offside. Aberdeen had their chances through David Goodwillie and Nicky Low, while Peter Pawlett brought a decent save out of Craig Gordon. Commons could have made it 3-0 when his curling shot clipped the crossbar and Deila's side looked like they would see the game out comfortably. But the Dons produced a rousing response and David Goodwillie nodded in his first goal for the club to half the deficit. Gordon was brought into action by Willo Flood as Aberdeen pushed for an unlikely equaliser but Celtic held on.

"More than 500 refugees from Syria's bloody civil war have already been resettled in the United States, and U.S. officials and members of Congress are becoming increasingly worried that jihadis linked to the ISIS terror army could slip into the country along with them. Since war broke out in Syria nearly four years ago, America has welcomed 524 people from the rapidly disintegrating country with open arms. U.S. intelligence agencies lack the resources to vet them properly, but the Obama administration plans to admit a few thousand more this year. 'The United States has admitted 524 Syrians since 2011,' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Feb. 13. 'We're likely to admit 1,000 to 2,000 Syrian refugees for permanent resettlement in Fiscal Year 2015 and a somewhat higher number, though still in the low thousands, in Fiscal Year 2016.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday that the US has already admitted 524 refugees into the United States from Syria, where intelligence about their links to terror groups like ISIS is hard to come by . Kurdish refugees have streamed across the border with Turkey since the bloody civil war broke out in Syria in 2011 . House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Rep Michael McCaul (right) called it a 'huge mistake' to resettle more Syrians in the United States . Assistant Secretary of State Anne Richard said in December that the State Department already had about 9,000 Syrian cases on its agenda, and receives 'roughly a thousand new ones each month.' The Department of Homeland Security ultimately makes the decisions. The idea that Islamist terrorists could use America's generous asylum system to bring their Holy War to the U.S. has set off a frenzy of complaints that the U.S. lacks the ability and resources to properly screen every Syrian who seeks safe haven from the Bashar al-Assad regime. 'It's clearly a population of concern,' National Counterterrorism Center director Nicholas Rasmussen told the House Homeland Security Committee on Feb. 11. FBI Assistant Director Michael Steinbach said Friday that there's a lack of reliable information on the ground about the Syrians applying to get into the US . Committee Chairman Mike McCaul, a Texas Republican, replied that it would be a 'huge mistake' to resettle more Syrians in the U.S. United Nations estimates suggest that as many as 4 million people have already fled Syria; another 7 million remain in the country but have been forced to leave their homes. The ISIS army, a self-proclaimed 'Islamic State,' is based in the Syrian city of Raqqa. Its reign of brutality has included mass executions, countless war crimes and the routine sexual abuse of women taken as 'wives' from conquered territory in Syria and Iraq. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price told Reuters in January that screening protocols for refugees 'are rigorous, . continually refined, and build on years of experience vetting . individuals coming to the United States from around the world.' 'They permit us to proceed in a . way that seeks to both safeguard public safety and serve our . mission of providing refuge to some of the world's most . vulnerable people.' But vetting is only possible if intelligence agencies have reliable information about the petitioners, who are usually referred by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. America has received hundres of refugees like these people fleeing to Lebanon . Syrian refugees are 'clearly a population of concern,' National Counterterrorism Center director Nicholas Rasmussen told the House Homeland Security Committee on Feb. 11 . FBI Assistant Director Michael Steinbach told the Homeland Security panel that unlike cases in Iraq, where the U.S. has had a presence for more than a decade, Syrians' applications are rarely accompanied by robust information about the petitioners. There's 'a lack of information' about many of them, Steinbach admitted. 'The difference is, in Iraq we were there on the ground collecting [intelligence], so we had databases to use.' But 'the lack of our footprint on the ground in Syria,' he said, means that 'the databases won't have the information we need. You are talking about a country that is a failed state, that does not have any infrastructure so to speak.' 'So all the data sets, the police, the intel services, that you would normally go to and seek that information, don’t exist.'","Members of Congress are suggesting it's unwise to let Syrians into the country, but 524 have come in already .
State Department plans to admit thousands more in the coming years .
Reliable intelligence and databases don't exist in Syria, making it difficult if not impossible to thoroughly vet each asylum applicant .
The ISIS terror army is based in Syria and has vowed to take its Holy War to Europe and beyond ."
"A children's Horrible Histories stage tour poster showing a hooded executioner holding a severed head has been labeled 'shockingly bad taste' by furious parents in the wake of the beheading of Western hostages by ISIS jihadists. The posters, advertising the 'Barmy Britain' tour, feature a big picture of an executioner holding an axe and a bloody head, and have been put up around the cities of Cambridge and Chelmsford in Essex. But parents are concerned the promotional pictures hold chilling similarities to the beheadings of British and American hostages by Islamic State militants. A children's Horrible Histories stage tour poster showing a hooded executioner holding a severed head has been labeled 'shockingly bad taste' by furious parents in the wake of the ISIS beheadings . Concerned parents have also pointed out that the executioner is masked and dressed in black in a similar way to the ISIS masked killer, known as 'Jihadi John.' The picture is accompanied by a speech bubble from the executioner saying: 'You'll laugh your head off.' Father-of-two Daniel Harris, 45, from Chelmsford, said: 'The posters are shocking in light of the recent events in the news and in really bad taste. 'The pictures are meant to be showing events in history, but sadly beheadings are still going on and are all too real. 'I can't understand why they haven't changed the posters as there are so many other images they could have used.' The posters, for the latest tour of Barmy Britain, feature a big picture of an executioner holding an axe and a bloody head, and have been put up around the cities of Cambridge and Chelmsford in Essex . The show is on at Chelmsford's Civic Theatre later this month and is currently being advertised . Another resident, Sarah Benjamin, 41, added: 'I did a double take when I saw the poster. I couldn't believe anyone would be so insensitive. 'The posters are up all around the town so it's hard to avoid them.' The Barmy Britain show, which is based on the popular series of Horrible Histories books by Terry Deary, is on tour until December. It starts a new leg  at The Civic Theatre in Chelmsford and describes itself as 'the horrible history of Britain with the nasty bits left in.' Neal Foster, director and producer of the show, said he was aware of a couple of complaints and had provided alternative posters to venues. Concerned parents have also pointed out that the executioner, also featured on the show's website (pictured), is masked and dressed in black in a similar way to the ISIS masked killer, known as 'Jihadi John' He said: 'It is unfortunate and we are sympathetic to anyone who is offended by the poster, but it was designed in July 2013, a long time before these recent incidents came to attention. 'If we had designed the poster after the incidents we obviously wouldn't have gone ahead with it. 'All the venues had between 200 to 800 posters and between 20,000 and 50,000 leaflets given to them last year which many started distributing in January, so from a practical point of view it is very hard to do anything. 'In light of what has happened we have given an alternative image to the theatres for them to use for social media or advertising campaigns if they wish, but I know some places felt it could be confusing to have two different posters for the same show.'","Posters for latest 'Barmy Britain' tour  feature picture of  executioner .

"Tottenham will face UEFA sanctions following the farcical pitch invasions during Thursday’s Europa League match against Partizan Belgrade. And it emerged on Friday that the three men arrested for running on to the White Hart Lane surface are serial pranksters. Mauricio Pochettino’s side booked their place in the knockout stages with a 1-0 win, Benjamin Stambouli scoring the winner. Roberto Soldado did not take kindly to one of the pitch invaders on Thursday, ripping his shirt off in anger . Dan Jarvis (left), Gomes Garcia (centre) and Nathan Brown (right) are the three men who stormed on to the pitch during Tottenham's Europa League clash with Partizan Belgrade at White Hart Lane on Thursday night . Spurs midfielder Mousa Dembele attempts to stop Jarvis, with the trio wearing 'BassBuds' t-shirts . But the clash was marred by three separate pitch invasions and UEFA said in a statement yesterday that its control, ethics and disciplinary body would hear the charge against Tottenham on December 11. European football’s governing body have a wide-ranging list of punishments for the offence of ‘field invasions’. They include a warning, a fine and even a points deduction. However, it seems likely the club will receive a hefty fine. The game was suspended for just under 10 minutes following three interruptions in the first half. The three men, who all wore T-shirts with the name of an audio company emblazoned across them, spent Thursday night in police custody. It emerged on Friday that the trio — Gomes Garcia, Nathan Brown and Dan Jarvis — are believed to be part of a group called TrollStation, whose internet prank videos have gone viral. Their previous stunts include turning a Tube carriage into a strip club and faking a kidnapping. Garcia had his shirt ripped off by Soldado, before the stewards eventually caught him . Tottenham's clash was interrupted three times by pitch invaders, which saw the game temporarily suspended . TrollStation also posted a video on their YouTube where they set up a 'strip club' on the London Underground . A TrollStation video, uploaded to YouTube late on Thursday night, starts with Gomes introducing the prank and his fellow pitch invaders ‘Nathan’ and ‘Jarvis’. He says: ‘Today we’re going to see who lasts longer on the pitch.’ The audio firm, who supply football-branded merchandise and advertise on Tottenham’s official website, have released a statement distancing themselves from the actions. Nevertheless, Spurs have taken the decision to stop any affiliation with them through all their official channels. UEFA have also confirmed that Mousa Dembele and Roberto Soldado of Spurs will not face disciplinary action after they tried to tackle two of the invaders. Meanwhile, Harry Kane says Tottenham will have ‘no excuse’ if they fail to end their awful post-Europa League form against Everton in the Barclays Premier League tomorrow. Spurs have struggled to deal with the demands of domestic football following their European exertions, especially at home. Liverpool, West Brom, Newcastle and Stoke have all won at White Hart Lane in games following the Europa League this season. Kane said: ‘That is what we have got to look to change if we want to do well in the Premier League and hopefully we can start against Everton. ‘There is no excuse because they played on Thursday night as well. It should be a good game.’ Harry Kane could start for Tottenham Hotspur against Everton at White Hart Lane . Everton will look to continue their recent upsurge in form when they visit White Hart Lane on Sunday . On Thursday’s farcical scenes, Kane added: ‘The first one was quite funny and I had a little chuckle to myself. But then it got a bit stupid in the end. We dealt with it well.’ Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard faces Tottenham having set his team-mates the target of qualifying for the Champions League, insisting they are better than when they finished fifth last season. Roberto Martinez’s men are only two points off fourth-placed Manchester United and despite a lengthening injury list, Howard is confident they can emulate the team under David Moyes that qualified in 2005. Howard, who was outstanding in Thursday’s 2-0 win in Wolfsburg that booked Everton’s place in the knockout stages of the Europa League, said: ‘We stuttered a bit at the start but when we play well we will have no problem. Last year we finished fifth and we are a stronger team now. The purpose is top four. We’ll fix our sights on that and see how we go.’ Everton’s European campaign has come at a cost in terms of injuries. James McCarthy limped off against Wolfsburg with a hamstring injury and joins John Stones, Steven Naismith, Antolin Alcaraz and Gareth Barry on the casualty list. Leighton Baines, Bryan Oviedo, Darron Gibson and Steven Pienaar also missed the trip to Germany.","Tottenham to face UEFA sanctions following pitch invasions on Thursday .

"Manchester United will not break the bank to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo — because he turned them down a year ago to sign a new deal with Real Madrid. While United would love Ronaldo back at Old Trafford because of his talent and star appeal, a package of about £120million for a player who turns 30 in February is considered a step too far even for the richest club in the world. United are determined that any potential move next summer will be done on their terms and are prepared to play hardball with Real, a club experiencing financial difficulties and expected to announce debts of nearly £400m at their annual general meeting on Sunday. Manchester United will not break the bank to bring Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo back to the club . Ronaldo turned down United in favour of signing a new deal in Spain last summer . VIDEO All Star XI: Ronaldo highlights . Likewise, there is little appetite to match Ronaldo’s wages in Madrid of £300,000 a week after tax and upset their other top United stars Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria. There is still irritation within the corridors of power at United that Ronaldo flirted with a return last year but ultimately used the club’s interest as a negotiating tool to sign a new five-year deal with Madrid — a move that makes him far more expensive to secure this time around. Real would want about £60m for Ronaldo next summer because the player would still have three years left on his contract and he would demand to be United’s highest-paid player with a four-year deal of about £300,000 a week. Ronaldo enjoyed six successful years at United under legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson . Ronaldo appears to be loving life in Madrid in this photo... but a Premier League return has been mooted . It would all add up to a £120m expenditure on a player who might not be the same force in his thirties as he has been over the past decade, despite remaining in stunning goalscoring form. On Saturday he bagged the 27th hat-trick of his career as Real romped to an 8-2 win at Deportivo La Coruna. In addition, the club have already embarked on a huge spending spree since being rejected by Ronaldo. The Glazers have paid £215m in transfer fees over the past 13 months on new players and an additional £50m is earmarked to make Falcao’s move from Monaco permanent next summer. Their latest financial results in September reported an 84 per cent drop in profits to £23m. Nobody at Old Trafford will want to completely rule out Ronaldo’s return as it would help to cement their worldwide popularity but a deal will only become likely if United feel it can be done with either a greatly reduced transfer fee or wage demands. United may not have the financial capability to pull of deal if they sign Radamel Falcao permanently next year . That possibility does exist, though, with Madrid’s latest set of financial figures shedding light on why they sold Di Maria in the summer. The biggest concern for the club’s president Florentino Perez is that, while the debt has shot up by 11.3 per cent from the previous year, income has only increased by five per cent in the same period. If the club’s debt continues to rise they would have to forgo their special status as a sporting association in Spain and, as a consequence, lose certain tax perks that they share with three other clubs — Barcelona, Osasuna and Athletic Bilbao. That special status is currently under investigation by the European Commission as possible illegal state aid to clubs.

"Necrophilia motivated a man to fatally shoot his stepdaughter last month, according to a Pennsylvania prosecutor. Gregory Graf recorded himself sexually abusing the body of Jessica Padgett, Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said on Friday. The video was discovered a day earlier on Graf's computer, the prosecutor said. Padgett, 33, was last seen alive on Nov. 21, when she left work at a day care center. Graf was arrested five days later after police found her body buried behind a shed on the property where he lives with Padgett's mother. Alleged necrophiliac: Gregory Graf recorded himself sexually abusing the body of Jessica Padgett, Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said on Friday . Graf, 53, is being held without bail on a homicide charge. The fencing company owner confessed to killing Padgett, a recently married mother of three, according to Morganelli. The victim's family said in a statement last month that Padgett 'was a beautiful, vibrant young woman who was beloved by her family and friends. The world shines less bright today.' Graf applied for a public defender, saying in court Friday that he didn't want to burden his family financially. A judge turned him down, ruling he had enough money to pay for his own defense. 'Like I said, I just don't want to take away the funds from the family,' said Graf, the owner of a fencing company. 'You're not going to be able to escape paying for the resources of an attorney,' Judge Stephen Baratta told Graf . 'I just can't allow that.' Morganelli said Graf will be charged with abuse of a corpse. Discovered: Graf was arrested five days later after police found Padgett's buried behind a shed on the property where he lives with Padgett's mother . Hunter: Gregory Graf's Facebook is filled with photos of him along with animals he's hunted . Arrested: Graf was arrested five days later after police found his stepdaughter's body buried behind a shed on the property where he lives with Padgett's mother . Killed: Padgett,  a 33-year-old mother of three, was last seen alive on November 21, when she left work at a day care center and her dead body was found in a shed five days later . 'He videotaped it,' Morganelli told Philly.com. 'So there's a videotape of him abusing the corpse sexually.' Morganelli said he believes that Graf took his stepdaughter's life in order to abuse her as a corpse. 'I believe it was a direct motive, in my opinion,' Morganelli said, 'and that's what we're going to be arguing.' Because the alleged abuse occurred after Padgett was killed Morganelli will not be able to seek the death penalty. Philly.com reports that under Pennsylvania law Rape and murder allow prosecutors to purse capital charges but sexual desecration of a corpse does not. Padgett went missing that day after she left Duck Duck Goose Child Care in Northampton and she never returned to her job there. Police say that the shooting happened around 10 minutes after she was last seen, though her body wasn't recovered until five days later. Morganelli has said Graf also had a marijuana-growing space at his house that was discovered by police as they searched for Padgett. Police seized 13 bags of marijuana and also confiscated $42,000 in cash and envelopes containing marijuana seeds from in a safe in the basement of Graf's home. \ . Graf's Facebook account indicates he has a love of hunting animals and has killed quite a few.

"The Lionel Messi reinvention continues apace with the four-times Balon d’Or winner showing once again that he is now very much king of the assists for Barcelona. The Argentine finally got on the score sheet with Barca’s fifth, but more importantly for Luis Enrique's team he broke down the home side’s defence with a glorious pass for Neymar’s opener. Dropping back into midfield he was the architect of Barcelona's carousel passing on the rain-soaked pitch at the Cuitat de Valencia stadium and when he set up Sandro in the second half it was his sixth assist of the season. Neymar opens the scoring for Barcelona against Levante on Sunday night . The Brazilian celebrates scoring Barcelona's first goal of the night against the bottom side . Lionel Messi is taken down in the area by Loukas Vyntra and Tono Garcia in the penalty area . He missed a first-half penalty but finally got on the scoresheet when Levante keeper Jesus Fernandez had a ‘Gary Sprake’ moment throwing the ball, not into his own net as the Leeds keeper did against Liverpool in 1967, but the next worse thing in the circumstances – straight to Messi who scored. He deserved his goal and his full return to form has helped give Barcelona a 100 per cent record at the start of the season. They are six points clear of Real Madrid and have yet to concede a goal in four league games. They could have taken an early lead through Jeremy Mathieu but he stabbed a shot with his favoured left foot weakly at the keeper from close range when a right-footed finish would have been preferable. Barça paid for their failure to take that early lead as Levante grew in confidence. Victor Camarasi played the ball forward to Jose Morales and he raced away from Mathieu but Ivan Rakitic saved the day charging back to make a goal-saving challenge at the far post.

Rakitic celebrates with star striker Messi after putting the Catalan giants 2-0 ahead . A wet night in Levante can be as tough as the proverbial cold night in Stoke and Barcelona were struggling to impose themselves in the rain – not helped by Neymar’s wayward finishing. He missed a one-on-one with Jesus Fernandez in the Levante goal and then seemed intimidated by the out-rushing keeper as they both went for a lofted Javier Mascherano pass. The Brazilian was getting plenty of opportunities with Messi starting to impose himself in midfield and finally the opening goal came. Messi played in Neymar with a superb pass and he rounded Fernandez to slot home. It was the Brazilian’s third goal of the season and Messi’s fifth assist. He has become the new king of the perfectly-weighted through ball in Xavi's absence and his magic had set Barcelona on their way. Sandro celebrates with his team-mates after adding another goal to Barcelona's tally . Sandro jumps for joy after putting Barcelona 3-0 against Levante on Sunday . Sandra points the finger after turning away to celebrate his goal and Barcelona's third against Levante . Rakitic looks to turn on the ball to get his way past David Barral during Barcelona's clash with Levante . He could and should have made it two but shot well wide from the spot after being brought down by Lucas Vyntra. The Greek defender was sent off harshly and now Levante really were in trouble chasing Barcelona’s ten men with their nine outfield players. Rakitic rifled in from distance to make it two after Rodas’ clearance ran straight to him. Neymar played very little part in the rest of the game. He fell badly on his left ankle and received lengthy treatment on the far side of the pitch with Doctor Ricard Pruna in attendance. He got back to his feet and was convinced he would be fine to carry on but the Barça bench had already got Sandro stripped and changed to come on: the Brazilian was not impressed. Pedro scores his first goal of the season for Barcelona to put them 4-0 up against Levante . Andreas Iniesta uses his strength to keep the ball away from Levante's midfielder Victor Camorsa . Lionel Messi caps an impressive display by completing Barcelona's rout of Levante with a delicious chip . Sandro wasted no time in netting his second goal of the season finding space from yet another Messi assist and stroking home the third. That was the cue for Xavi to replace Sergi Busquets as Barcelona looked to save legs ahead of this week’s midweek fixtures. The 19-year-old Sandro wasn’t finished either. He set up the next with a pass to send Jordi Alba tearing down the left. He pulled the ball back to Pedro who scored his first goal of the season. And there was still time left for the wet conditions to get the better of Fernandez whose throw straight to Messi made sure the Barça number ten had his goal for the night in what had been another very convincing Barça win.","Barcelona thrashed the La Liga bottom side on their own stomping ground .

"Did Mario Balotelli really get a standing ovation from Liverpool fans after doing the square root of nothing for 71 minutes against Aston Villa on Saturday evening? I thought players had to earn that kind of reaction, not just turn up and wear the shirt. Liverpool fans have rightly given standing ovations to some very special and hard-working players in the past. These supporters traditionally know their stuff, they demand a lot before giving their seal of approval. Mario Balotelli received an unwarranted standing ovation when subbed off on his Liverpool home debut . Mario Balotelli was replaced by Rickie Lambert with 19 minutes remaining as Liverpool trailed 1-0 . Mario Balotelli was largely anonymous as Liverpool slipped to defeat against Aston Villa . Yet Balotelli has turned up, said the right things to get the fans onside, shown a bit of swagger but not a lot of quality, and the Anfield faithful seem to be happy with that. Shouldn’t you lot be demanding more? If the message to Balotelli from the fans is that Saturday’s effort (or lack of it) is enough to keep them happy, then why would he demand more from himself? I’m all for supporting and encouraging a player, especially a new signing. That’s why it’s hard to criticise Manchester United fans for going a little bit over the top with their cheering and applause for Radamel Falcao – as he warmed up. Mario Balotelli has already won the hearts of Liverpool fans following his summer move from Milan . Mario Balotelli shakes hands with his captain Steven Gerrard ahead of his first appearance at Anfield . But in recent years Liverpool fans have enjoyed the quality and energy of Luis Suarez, the passion and commitment of Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard, the desire to improve shown by Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson. It’s early days for Balotelli, and he may turn out to be brilliant. But then, and only then, will he deserve the kind of response he received on Saturday evening. If his match sharpness really isn’t there yet, as Brendan Rodgers seems to suggest, then I can’t understand why Rickie Lambert didn’t start ahead of Balotelli. I’m not convinced that is a good enough excuse for Balotelli’s inertia on Saturday. He hadn’t been away on international duty so he should have done better. Brendan Rodgers probably should have started with Rickie Lambert ahead of the not-fully-fit Balotelli . Don’t settle for less than what you deserve Liverpool fans – just because his name is Mario Balotelli doesn’t mean he should get away with giving less than what you supporters deserve. More effort and more quality is required from the Italian international. Or I suspect that faith from the fans will be tested to the full.","Mario Balotelli was ineffective during his first Anfield appearance as Liverpool lost 1-0 to Aston Villa .

"A fast-acting drug for the most lethal form of skin cancer is set to be made widely available on the NHS. The drug dabrafenib can quickly help patients with a certain type of melanoma - even if they are severely unwell or bedridden - the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said. Marketed by pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, dabrafenib has been shown to have 'rapid positive effects' and enabled some people to resume everyday activities. The drug dabrafenib can quickly help patients with a certain type of melanoma (pictured). Draft guidance from the drug watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, has recommended its use on the NHS . Final draft guidance from the drug watchdog said the medication should be made available - as long as it was sold to the NHS at a discount. Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer, affecting more than 13,000 Britons annually and killing 2,000 patients a year. It is now the fifth most common cancer and is now the most common cancer in young people aged 15-34 in the UK. In the past decade, cases of the disease have increased by over 50 per cent. Experts blame the rise on the explosion in package holidays by sun-seekers starting in the 1960s, as well as young people spending more time than ever before in pursuit of a tan that often leads to cancer-causing sunburn. The drug, which is also known as Tafinlar, targets a specific type of melanoma which tests positive for the BRAF V600 mutation. This mutation causes skin cells to multiply more rapidly, speeding up the spread of skin cancer. Dabrafenib works by causing cancer cells with the mutation to die, which can slow or stop the growth of the cancer. The guidance says it should be made available for patients who tested positive for the mutation and whose cancer had spread or could not be completely removed by surgery. Professor Carole Longson, director for the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation at NICE, said: 'For a long time, the treatments available for skin cancer which has spread have been very limited. 'However, in recent years, a number of breakthrough treatments that can potentially significantly improve the prognosis for some people with malignant melanoma have become available. 'NICE has already recommended vemurafenib and ipilimumab and we hope to add dabrafenib to the list of options available. 'The information provided by GlaxoSmithKline, who market the drug, suggested that dabrafenib works just as well as vemurafenib which also targets melanoma with the BRAF V600 mutation. 'Drugs like dabrafenib are also thought to have very rapid positive effect for patients, even in those who are very unwell or bed-ridden. 'In some cases, it has enabled people to resume everyday activities.' Professor Paul Workman, interim chief executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, welcomed the news. He said: 'It's great news that Nice has given the green light to use of dabrafenib on the NHS. 'Its approval underlines the importance of a new generation of cancer drugs targeted at specific molecular features of tumours - drugs which after years of painstaking development are now making their way to patients. 'The discovery of dabrafenib was underpinned by research done here at The Institute of Cancer Research, and its approval increases the treatment options available on the NHS for patients with metastatic melanoma.' Cases of melanoma have increased by over 50 per cent in the past decade, with experts blaming the rise in package holidays in the 1960s as well as young people burning in their quest for a tan .","Draft NICE guidance suggest dabrafenib should be made widely available .

"Beard: Harnaam Kaur, 23, has polycystic ovary syndrome, which can cause excessive hair growth . A 23-year-old woman with a condition causing excessive hair development has revealed that growing a beard makes her feel more feminine. Harnaam Kaur, of Slough, Berkshire, suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome - and a beard first started to appear on her face aged just 11. The hair quickly spread to her chest and arms, and the condition made her the victim of taunts at school and on the street. She even received death threats from strangers over the internet. But Miss Kaur has now decided to stop cutting her hair after being baptised as a Sikh - a religion in which cutting body hair is forbidden. She said: ‘I would never ever go back now and remove my facial hair because it's the way God made me and I'm happy with the way I am. 'I feel more feminine, more sexy and I think I look it too. I've learned to love myself for who I am nothing can shake me now.’ During her early teens, Miss Kaur was so ashamed of her beard that she waxed twice a week, and also tried bleaching and shaving. But the hair became thicker and spread - with Miss Kaur feeling so self-conscious that she refused to leave her house. She even began self-harming and she considered suicide. She said: ‘I got bullied badly - at school I was called a “beardo” and things like “shemale” and “sheman”. I can laugh about it now, but back then it affected me so badly that I began to self-harm because it felt better than all the abuse I was getting. ‘I'd talk to people with a hand over my face and I wore baggy, tomboy clothes to cover up the hair on my chest and arms. ‘I didn't want to go outside my house because I couldn't take the stares from strangers so I'd lock myself in my room. It got so bad that I just didn't want to live anymore.’ Scroll down for video . Applying mascara: Miss Kaur has now decided to stop cutting her hair after being baptized as a Sikh . Despite all the opposition, she took the step to bear her beard, and now embraces the thick hair on her face and chest. But at the age of 16, everything . changed for Miss Kaur when she decided to be baptised as a Sikh. It . meant she would have to let her facial hair grow out. The . decision proved controversial - especially with her family. Miss Kaur . said: ‘My mum and dad didn't want me to do it - they didn't think I'd be . able to have a normal life if I had a beard. ‘They . worried I wouldn't be able to get married and that I'd never get a job. But I wanted to make my own decisions and live for myself - not anyone . else. I'd had enough of hiding. Out in Slough: Miss Kaur (centre) with her younger brother Gurdeep, 18, and friend Surrinder Bhachy, 40 . ‘I'd . had enough of the bullying and the self-harming and the suicidal . thoughts. I wanted to change my whole outlook on life and I thought I . thought it was time to stop locking myself away - I had to do something . about it.’ PCOS is a common condition affecting a woman's ovaries, with three main features. These are cysts developing in their ovaries, the ovaries not regularly releasing eggs, and high levels of male hormones - 'androgens'. The syndrome is associated with irregular hormone levels in the body, including insulin. There is no cure for the condition, but medicine is available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth and fertility problems. Most women with the condition can get pregnant - but sometimes need a surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling. This involves destroying tissue in the ovaries making androgens including testosterone. Her parents have come to terms with her decision - and her brother Gurdeep Singh, 18, is her biggest supporter. She said: ‘It was incredibly daunting going outside because people would stare more than ever. At first I was angry but I realised . that they didn't understand and were probably too afraid to ask me so I . just decided to smile back.’ But . Miss Kaur has struggled to get a job and even shaved off her beard at . the age of 17 after pressure from members of her extended family. She said: ‘I removed my beard once during a really low moment but when I'd done it all I could do was cry because I didn't feel like myself without my beard. ‘My brother was actually the one person who was completely shocked by what I had done - he hugged me and said I had looked so beautiful with my beard, he didn't understand why I had done it.’ She added: ‘It was from that point that I thought I'm never going to remove it ever again.’ Happier now: Miss Kaur has been employed at a local Sikh primary school as a teaching assistant and her confidence has soared . Since then Miss Kaur has been employed at a local Sikh primary school as a teaching assistant and her confidence has soared. 'I couldn't take the stares from strangers so I'd lock myself in my room. It got so bad that I just didn't want to live anymore' Harnaam Kaur . She said: ‘I still get shop assistants calling me “sir” and strange looks from people - they see my beard first and realise I've actually got breasts too. It must be confusing for a lot of people. ‘The funniest reactions I get are from the children at my school. Some ask me what my beard is and I joke it's a Halloween costume. Some even ask me where I buy it and I just say “Asda”. ‘I can laugh about it now - sometimes I say I'm a man and I put on a deep voice to scare other people because it's quite funny to see their reaction.’ Siblings: Her parents have come to terms with her decision - and her brother Gurdeep Singh, 18, is her biggest supporter . Despite often being mistaken for a man, Miss Kaur says she feels more feminine than ever - choosing girly tops over baggy, high-necked jumpers. 'I feel more feminine, more sexy and I think I look it too' Harnaam Kaur . She said: ‘I'm able to go out and shop in the women's section without feeling I shouldn't be there. I wear skirts, dresses and jewellery and I like to get my nails done like every other girl.’ Today Miss Kaur hopes her story will help other women find self-confidence. She has decided to share her story on YouTube - and continues to upload videos despite receiving death threats. She said: ‘I've had people telling me they're going to burn me and throw a brick at me - all sorts of things like that. Younger days: Miss Kaur is pictured (left and right) during a wedding in India, aged 13. A beard first started to appear on her face aged just 11 . ‘But I've also had a lot of positive messages from women in the same situation as me. I've also had loads of nice comments from men all over the world. One even asked me to marry him. ‘I haven't found a potential husband yet. I still get some grief from the men in my community and it does still seem to be a barrier to marriage. But I'm young and there's still plenty of time for that. ‘All that matters to me at the moment is that I love myself. I love my beard and all my other little quirks - my tattoos, my scars, stretch marks and blemishes. ‘I want other women to find the strength that I have. If I had any message it would be to live the way you want - it's your journey and it's your life.’","Harnaam Kaur, of Slough, Berkshire, has polycystic ovary syndrome .

"China's Ministry of defence today warned the U.S. to be 'careful in its words and actions' as it made moves to strengthen its military bases across Asia. In a statement, ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng announced China's response to the U.S.'s new military strategy developed under the Obama administration. 'We have noted that the United States issued this guide to its defence strategy, and we will closely observe the impact that U.S. military strategic adjustment has on the Asia-Pacific region and on global security developments,' Geng said in a statement issued on the ministry's website. China's ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng, pictured said the U.S.'s new military strategy would be 'beneficial' for both countries . 'The accusations leveled at China by the U.S. side in this document are totally baseless'. 'We hope that the United States will flow with the tide of the era, and deal with China and the Chinese military in an objective and rational way, will be careful in its words and actions, and do more that is beneficial to the development of relations between the two countries and their militaries.' President Barack Obama vowed last week to look beyond the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that he inherited to focus on Asian security risks — like China and North Korea. 'The tide of war is receding but the question that this strategy answers is what kind of military will we need long after the wars of the last decade are over,' he told a Pentagon news conference last week. There has been growing concern in the U.S. and Asia about China's military developments in recent years. President Obama speaking during a media briefing at the Pentagon where he vowed to strengthen military presence in the Asia-Pacific . Under its new strategy, the U.S. will maintain large bases in Japan and South Korea and deploy Marines, navy ships and aircraft to Australia's Northern Territory. The plans outline ways to counter potential attempts by China and Iran to block access for the U.S. from entering areas like the South China Sea and Strait of Hormuz. However, counter-insurgency operations which have been robust since 2007 when a surge of extra troops were sent to Iraq could be far more limited. China has so far aimed to maintain an amicable relationship with the U.S. despite it being a time its ruling Communist Party prepares for a change in leadership. Chinese President Hu Jintao has made clear he wants to avoid repeating rifts that have have previously soured ties with Washington in the first half of 2011. Hu retires from power late in 2012 and his almost-certain successor, Vice President Xi Jinping, is likely to visit the U.s. in coming months. The Chinese Foreign Ministry  Liu Weimin today claimed the U.S. is wrong to think that Beijing posed a threat to America's security. He said: 'The accusation targeting China in the (U.S.'s strategy) document has no basis, and is fundamentally unrealistic. 'China adheres to the path of peaceful development, an independent and peaceful foreign policy and a defensive national defence policy.' China has been expanding its naval force with submarines and a maiden aircraft carrier, and has also increased its missile and surveillance capabilities. One of the biggest security threats in Asia is the ownership of oil-rich reefs and islands in the South China Sea, through which $5 trillion dollars in trade passes through every year.","Ministry spokesman said China would 'observe' the impact of a new military strategy outlined by U.S.

"Which country boasts the best league in Europe and how do we determine such? Heard that before? One suggestion was to have the 20 teams from two nations play each other in order of position - 1st versus 1st, 2nd versus 2nd and so on – and calculate a score based on the outcomes. This Ryder Cup style scenario will never happen, of course, but this week an Anglo-Germanic playoff of sorts on the continental stage is taking place. It will not provide a definitive answer to the Premier League-versus-Bundesliga debate, but we will learn how the top clubs from those respective countries are set to fare at the onset of the European campaign. Jerome Boateng (out of shot) strikes the winner past the despairing Manchester City keeper Joe Hart . Boateng (centre) jumps for joy in celebration of his winning striker for Bayern Munich over Man City . And the Champions league action has given a clear indicator that the Premier League is lagging behind its German counterparts. Borussia Dortmund got things underway by beating Arsenal 2-0 on Tuesday night with a display far more convincing than the scoreline suggested. Bayern Munich added another win for the Germans when a late Jerome Boateng striker edged out a resilient Manchester City. The total number of Champions League opening round defeats by Premier League teams between 2004/05 and 2013/14: 2 . The number of Champions League opening round defeats by Premier League teams during 2014/15 season: 2 . And even unfancied Schalke, beset by injuries, managed to get in on the act with a precious point at in-form Chelsea. Some might even argue there's was a morale victory given that nobody gave the Germans a chance before kick-off.

After a five-year absence Everton return to Europe and manager Roberto Martinez is promising to make every effort to win the competition. The Spaniard sees the Europa League as a platform to greater things rather than an unwanted distraction. Like the Toffees, Wolfsburg were fifth last season and have former Chelsea forward Kevin De Bruyne – an £18million signing in January – as their key offensive threat. But De Bruyne and co have struggled this season. They have picked up just two points in the league and needed penalties to get past second tier SV Darmstadt in the cup. Everton, likewise, were slow to find their stride but a convincing 2-0 win at West Brom on Saturday gives them momentum heading into their first taste of Thursday-Sunday football since 2009/10.

"Swansea City waited two years and four months for Roy Hodgson to pay a visit to the Liberty Stadium. He will not have left with thoughts of a new-look England. He had eight potential recruits among the 22 starters, but they could not have offered up less of a show. It's a shame considering the form, excitement and shock value both sides have provided since this campaign started. But there was none of that here, except perhaps for some of the latter from the stupid challenge of Wilfried Bony towards the end of the first half. Swansea's record signing Wilfried Bony was sent off for a second bookable offence, it was a huge blow for Garry Monk's side as the Ivorian had been playing well . Swansea players look dejected as Victor Wanyama slams home Southampton's winner late on in the game . Wanyama is surrounded by team-mates as Ronald Koeman's Southampton picked up another three points . Victor Wanyama's strike with 10 minutes remaining was enough to win it for Southampton, the Kenyan was set up by last week's hero Graziano Pelle . Swansea (4-2-3-1): Fabianski 6; Rangel 6, Fernandez 6, Williams 6.5, Taylor 5; Ki 6.5 (Emnes 85), Shelvey 5.5; Dyer 5.5 (Montero 59, 6), Sigurdsson 6.5, Routledge 6.5; Bony 4. Subs not used: Tremmel, Richards, Bartley, Carroll, Gomis. Booked: Bony . Sent off: Bony . Southampton (4-3-3): Forster 6; Clyne 6, Fonte 6, Yoshida 5 (Gardos 46, 6), Bertrand 6; Cork 6 (S Davis 63, 6), Schneiderlin 6.5, Ward-Prowse 5.5 (Wanyama 69, 7); Long 5.5, Pelle 6, Tadic 6. Subs not used: K Davis, Mayuka, Targett, McQueen. Booked: Fonte, Yoshida, Bertrand, Schneiderlin . Referee: Jonathan Moss 5 . Att: 20,596 . MOM: Victor Wanyama . It afforded him a second yellow card and turned the match in Southampton's favour, with victory sealed by Victor Wanyama's late winner. 'After the red card it changed,' said Southamton manager Ronald Koeman, who now has 10 points from five games. 'This start is nice for the fans. As the manager, I have to keep quiet and continue doing what we are doing. There is no time to celebrate. Football changes fast.' Garry Monk, predictably, counted the cost of Bony's dismissal. 'He was distraught with himself,' he said. 'You make mistakes, I've done it myself. He will learn from it. He held his hands up. 'We didn't deserve to lose that game. Football can be harsh sometimes.' For Hodgson's purposes, it was about searching out new possibilities — overdue possibilities in the mind of Monk. But as valid an argument as that has been in the past, only Wayne Routledge emerged from Monk's trio of candidates with any significant credit. Nathan Dyer was hauled off after 59 minutes and Jonjo Shelvey never got going. For Southampton, James Ward-Prowse left on a stretcher in the second half after an innocuous challenge from Federico Fernandez. ' It is his foot but I do not think it is serious,' said Koeman. It had all started quite promisingly for the Englishmen of Swansea, who are still waiting for the return from injury of Leon Britton, their most effective eligible player. Within 10 minutes, Shelvey took possession in the centre and played a pass into the run of Routledge, whose low cross from the left was perfect. Dyer entered the box from the right and was inches away from connecting. Former Vitesse Arnhem forward Bony's two-footed lunge on Southampton defender Maya Yoshida was enough to earn a second yellow card for the forward .

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . Routledge had a better chance after 28 minutes, running on to Gylfi Sigurdsson's pass and hitting the bar. Bony then had a header cleared off the line by Ryan Bertrand as his peculiar season continued. He scored 25 last season but is yet to get off the mark this time around. It got worse when he was red-carded six minutes before the break. His first booking, for running into Jose Fonte, was a touch harsh; his second was justified, a senseless tackle from behind on Maya Yoshida. Swansea had dominated but the red card let Southampton take control. Graziano Pelle glanced a header wide with their first real chance after 65 minutes and Dusan Tadic then drew a comfortable save from Lukasz Fabianski with a free-kick. Wanyama, on for Ward-Prowse, finally found a way through after 80 minutes, shooting hard across Fabianski. Hodgson left before the whistle, which was probably fair enough.

"Sergio Garcia may be playing in his seventh Ryder Cup but he insists the desire to beat America 'as hard as you can' remains undimmed. Previous teams have always had a significant Spanish influence, with the likes of Seve Ballesteros and Jose-Maria Olazabal and Garcia, who took on that mantle over the last decade or so. However, after the heroics of Ian Poulter in 2012 and the presence of world number one Rory McIlroy also in the European ranks, Garcia is not now really thought of as the go-to guy when it comes to geeing up the team. Sergio Garcia laughs during a press conference ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup . Garcia has been practising with Team Europe this week at Gleneagles, in the lead-up to Friday . But there is no doubt the fire still burns bright within the 34-year-old. 'This is not a competition. I think we all know what we bring to the team,' he said. 'At the end of the day, the most important thing is that we are all here together and we are all here fighting for each other. 'Everybody has their own way of doing it and we love the way Poults does it, and we all try to do it the way we know that works better for us and for the team. 'The drive to try to do well and obviously win, it's still the same. 'There's no doubt Europeans now are a lot more global than we used to be and a lot more of us play on the PGA Tour and get to play with a lot of the Americans. 'We get to know each other better and obviously have closer relationships, but once you put your clothes on and your shoes on and you step on the first tee you still want to beat them as hard as you can, the same way that they do with us. 'That's the nature of the game. That doesn't change.' Garcia seemed in good spirits on Wednesday as he addressed the media . Spectators watch on as Garcia drives from the 10th tee during a practice round on Wednesday . Garcia practised with McIlroy on Tuesday and it is entirely possible the two will be paired together on Friday morning's fourballs. The world number one and current holder of two of this year's four majors is, as he was two years ago, Europe's form player. 'He's definitely grown up a lot, I think both as a player and as a person,' said Garcia. 'He's gotten to know what the Ryder Cup is all about even better. He has a lot more respect for it - not that he didn't before. 'He lives it a little bit more than maybe he would have at the beginning, so I think he's become a really nice team player.

"Joe Hart is fighting to keep his place in Manchester City's starting line-up as the Premier League champions embark on a critical week in their season.

If you want to be a top goalkeeper you must have all the attributes – good distribution, to know when to go for the ball, to be good one-on-one, to not concede early goals. 'It's important to have competition in every position in the team, not just with Joe Hart and Willy Caballero.' Hart was criticised for allowing Mame Biram Diouf's low shot to go under his body when Stoke won 1-0 at the Etihad, but Pellegrini insisted that Caballero's prospects do not hinge on his rival's errors. 'I am not waiting for Joe Hart to make a first mistake to change him for Willy Caballero,' said Pellegrini. 'Maybe in the last year Joe didn't start very well but he finished very well. 'I analyse the goals and individual mistakes with the players, the whole team. I think a lot of players were involved in [conceding] that goal.'

"Arsene Wenger accused his Arsenal team of failing to perform as they slumped in Dortmund and returned home with Jack Wilshere at the centre of another injury scare. Wilshere twisted his right ankle near the end of the 2-0 defeat and Wenger admitted he was concerned because it is the same joint which ruled him out of action for 17 months. 'It's difficult to say how bad it is,' said the Arsenal manager. 'Normally it would not be too bad but I am a bit cautious because of his history.' Arsenal's Jack Wilshere went down injured late on to add to Arsene Wenger's mounting problems . Wilshere has injured his right ankle, which has been problematic for him over the past two years . Arsene Wenger conceded that his side were second best against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night . Injuries are piling up on Arsenal and a blow to Wilshere will deepen the gloom after their Champions League campaign got off to a poor start, as they were deservedly beaten by the Germans. 'It was a difficult night,' said Wenger. 'Dortmund were the better team. We had a disappointing performance. It is difficult to go into individual assessment of any player because as a team were not at the required level. 'Still the paradox of the night is that we had very good chances to score first. We were caught on two counter-attacks. For the first, we lost the ball 80 metres from our goal. There were enough people to stop the goal. We were still three-against-one at the back. It's difficult to understand how we conceded the goal.' Ciro Immobile scores Borussia Dortmund's first goal which Arsene Wenger said it was difficult to understand . Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made it 2-0 early in the second period once again on the counter-attack . Arsenal were overwhelmed in midfield, conceding two goals in a three-minute period either side of half-time. It could have been many more as Wenger's team were punished by their fast counter-attacking opponents. Ciro Immobile scored the first and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang the second. Aubameyang also hit the bar. 'They were very strong in midfield, stronger than us, I agree,' said Wenger, who also defended Danny Welbeck, his new £16million signing who missed a clear chance to open the scoring. 'He will improve,' said Wenger. 'I don't think we have to make a problem of that. He had a lively first half, two or three good chances; one obvious one. We have to be a bit patient maybe.' VIDEO Disappointed Wenger bemoans counter-attacks . Arsenal's new striker Danny Welbeck had the Gunners' best chance at 0-0 but slid the ball wide . Welbeck needs more time according to his new boss Wenger who asked for patience for the striker . Dortmund unleashed a barrage of 23 shots at Arsenal's goal. Aaron Ramsey apologised to fans on Twitter and captain Mikel Arteta said: 'We faced a top side at one of the toughest stadiums in Europe. They have a lot of pace up front and we gave the ball away too many times. They took the game where they wanted to take it.' Teenage right-back Hector Bellerin started his first Arsenal game in the absence of injured defenders Mathieu Debuchy and Nacho Monreal and Calum Chambers who had tonsillitis and was an unused substitute. Borussia Dortmund were also hit by injuries, with many players missing, but the victory puts them in control of Group D. Anderlecht and Galatasaray drew 1-1 in the other game. Wenger pinned the blame on his players after another game where Mesut Ozil failed to shine . 'I am very pleased,' said Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp. 'Three players went out of the team because of muscle problems but we made some decisions and I have to say it was a great performance by the team. Really strong. 'We were brave, we were fast and that is everything we needed for this game. We had other chances but two-nil is perfect for us against a strong opponent. I enjoyed it from the first second until the last. To see games like this, it is the best in the world. We play this quickly it's very hard to defend against.' Arsenal's next test is at home to Galatasaray in a fortnight.","Jack Wilshere twisted his right ankle late on in 2-0 defeat .

"Julie Bishop's popularity has nearly doubled in the past five months with the Foreign Minister now rivalling Prime Minister Tony Abbott as preferred Liberal leader. A Fairfax-Ipsos nationwide poll found Ms Bishop and Mr Abbott each have 20 percent support from voters in the preferred leadership stakes. But the pair both fall into second place behind Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull who remains the overall choice with 35 percent support. Scroll down for video . A nationwide poll found Julie Bishop and Tony Abbott each have 20 percent support from voters in the preferred leadership stakes . The surge in support for Ms Bishop could be a result of her strong performance in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security in recent months, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine. The Foreign Minister was also regarded for pushing the resolution the United Nations Security Council passed back in July to allow Australia and other countries access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site to retrieve the bodies. The surge in support for Ms Bishop could be a result of her strong performance in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security in recent months . Ms Bishop's popularity has jumped from 11 percent in June to 20 percent. The Fairfax poll of 1,401 voters, carried out between Thursday and Sunday, found female voters heavily favoured Mr Turnbull or Ms Bishop. When asked by a journalist in Sydney if Ms Bishop was now Mr Abbott's heir apparent, he said: 'I think Julie is my stellar colleague. 'I think that's what she is, along with Malcolm Turnbull, Joe Hockey, Scott Morrison and the rest of the team.' Treasurer Joe Hockey is draining support over the government's tough budget, dipping from 11 per cent in July to eight per cent. Meanwhile, federal Labor has recorded its best Newspoll result in more than three months. Ms Bishop's popularity has jumped from 11 percent in June to 20 percent . According to the poll, conducted for The Australian last weekend, Labor's primary vote rose two points in the last two weeks to 36 per cent - its highest level of support in three and a half months. Coalition support remained steady at 38 per cent, while the Greens dropped one point to 13 per cent. Independents and minor parties also fell one point, now sitting at 13 per cent. The poll gives Labor its 13th consecutive lead over the coalition in two-party-preferred terms.

"Diego Costa will contest his violent conduct charge with the full backing of Chelsea as the Barclays Premier League leaders make a stand against what Jose Mourinho believes is an orchestrated campaign against his team. Costa faces a three-match ban after referee Michael Oliver admitted he had not seen the incident when he appeared to stamp on Liverpool's Emre Can during Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge and set the Football Association's disciplinary process in motion. Chelsea's 17-goal top scorer had to respond before 6pm on Thursday to the charge and, as he has chosen to contest it, the case will be passed to an independent commission to decide on Friday. VIDEO Scroll down to view Sportsmail's preview of Chelsea vs Manchester City . Diego Costa, training with Chelsea on Thursday, has contested his FA charge for stamping on Emre Can . Costa has scored 17 goals this season but looks set to miss out on the game against Manchester City . Chelsea striker Costa (right) moves towards the ball after  Can takes a tumble off the pitch . Costa appears to stamp on Can's right leg during a feisty opening period at Stamford Bridge . Can was left writhing on the ground in pain but Costa was not punished my referee Michael Oliver . The Blues insist that the incident was 'accidental' with Mourinho fiercely defending his star striker after the match. The commission will look at video footage, the observations of the referee Oliver and consider written and video evidence on behalf of Costa, who will miss games against Manchester City, Aston Villa and Everton if found guilty. It will be a surprise if he escapes punishment, but Costa, Mourinho and others at the club have been incensed by the charge and are determined to fight it. Mourinho is in full siege mode ahead of the title clash with champions City at Stamford Bridge, on Saturday, claiming there is an anti-Chelsea agenda fuelled by Sky. Chelsea have also cancelled the manager's usual eve-of-game press conference, which will prompt another letter from the Premier League to seek an explanation for breaking their rules on mandatory media duties. Costa and Can clash after the incident, which occurred close to Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho . German midfielder Can has to be held back from Costa by his Liverpool team-mate Martin Skrtel . Thierry Henry (left) and Jamie Redknapp both agreed that Costa should've been shown a red card . Jose Mourinho has fiercely defended Costa, insisting the stamping incident was 'accidental' Costa took part in full training but Cesc Fabregas was a notably absentee for the Blues . From Chelsea's angle, this is a show of solidarity on a point of principle. They may not win any friends and may not convince the disciplinary commission that is was an accidental stamp - but the club is standing firm in support of Costa because they feel the aggressive elements of his game have been unfairly high-lighted and scrutinised through the season. These erupted during the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool, a game broadcast live on Sky Sports, with Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp on duty in the analysis team. Chelsea were not impressed to see 'Costa's Crimes' listed on Sky Sports, referring to flashpoints from the game. Mourinho seems convinced Redknapp, a former Liverpool and Tottenham midfielder, has it in for Chelsea, and that Sky, who also happen to pump millions into the sport, pushed the FA towards the charge by looping repeats of Costa's challenge on Can, and other clashes with Martin Skrtel and Steven Gerrard.

There are parallels to a storm which erupted in October 2005, after a tackle by Michael Essien on Didi Hamann during a Champions League game at the Bridge, which was not punished by the referee but later the subject of a two-match ban from UEFA. Hamann claimed it was the worst tackle he'd suffered in his career, but Mourinho blamed Sky for UEFA's intervention because they replayed the footage so much and refused to do interviews with them for a while. Chelsea were without Essien for both legs of their tie against Barcelona and were beaten on aggregate. It is not the first time Mourinho has mentioned the 'campaign'. He was fined £25,000 for public comments after a game at Southampton claiming officials were being influenced by it. He was also warned about comments made regarding the need for a 'strong referee' before a game at Stoke. During last season, his first back in England, he was in trouble with the FA. He was fined £8,000 for going on the pitch during a stormy defeat at Aston Villa, when Ramires and Willian were sent off and was fined £10,000 for sarcastic remarks about referees' boss Mike Riley after a defeat at home to Sunderland during which his assistant Rui Faria was sent off and banned for six games. Mourinho was also fined £8,000 after he was ordered from the touchline during a home win against Cardiff for an outburst about time-wasting by the visitors.

"It may look rather more like a toy car than a hi-tech racing machine, but this mini-racer has become the world's fastest electric car. Called the Grimsel, and developed by Swiss researchers, it broke the previous world record for acceleration by going from 0 to 100 km/h in 1.785 seconds in under 30 metres. The carbon fibre construction has a total weight of 168 kg and produces about 200 hp (147 kW). Scroll down for video .

The planetary gearbox which is integrated into the upright transmits the torque to accumulated 1630Nm at the wheels. The chassis is a one piece carbon fibre monocoque . Aerodynamics package produces enough downforce to drive at the ceiling at 110km/h. Raced by the  the Formula Student team at the Academic Motorsports Club Zurich (AMZ), it beat the previous record of 2.134 seconds, which was held by an electric car built by Delft University of Technology. The new record was set at the military airfield in Dübendorf, where the vehicle reached a speed of 100 km per hour in less than 30 metres. The new record-breaking vehicle is a Formula Student electric car that was developed and built in less than a year by 30 students at ETH Zurich and Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. The ‘grimsel’ is the fifth AMZ electric car and the result of continuous development. The carbon fibre construction has a total weight of 168 kg and produces about 200 hp (147 kW). A four-wheel drive is implemented with four specially designed wheel hub motors, which generate a total torque of 1630 Nm at the wheels. By means of traction control, torque distribution is controlled individually for each wheel to maximise vehicle acceleration. No other production vehicle in the world has reached a similarly strong acceleration. The new record was set at the military airfield in Dübendorf, where the vehicle reached a speed of 100 km per hour in less than 30 metres. The ‘grimsel’ celebrated numerous successes at the Formula Student international competition this summer. With more than 500 teams, Formula Student is the world’s biggest competition for engineers and is held annually at various locations around the globe. With three overall wins and an average of 920 points out of a possible 1,000, the ‘grimsel’ is AMZ’s most successful car. And with its victories in Austria and Spain, it achieved the two highest scores in the European history of Formula Student. These further strengthened AMZ’s standing at the top of the Formula Student world rankings and demonstrated the potential in electric drive concepts.","Called Grimsel and developed by Swiss researchers .

"The Prince of Wales had a Mexican town in a spin yesterday when he showed off his fancy footwork and joined a delighted group of locals for a spot of traditional dancing. Charles didn't have to be asked twice when the performers asked him to join them during a visit to the picturesque coastal town of Campeche on Mexico's Caribbean coast. Twirling a handkerchief above his head and copying the men and women around him, a beaming Prince of Wales deftly tapped his feet to the music as he took part in the dance, known locally as a Sarao Campechano. Scroll down for video . Strictly Charles: The Prince of Wales had a Mexican town in a spin when he showed off his fancy footwork and joined locals for a dance . Fancy footwork: Charles was visiting the picturesque town of Campeche which is on Mexico's Caribbean coastline . In a spin: Charles twirled a handkerchief around his head as he took part in a traditional Sarao Campechano dance . The heir to the throne has stepped on the dance floor in a number of countries he has visited in recent years. Memorable moments include an impromptu ballroom session in New Zealand in 2012 and a spot of sword dancing in Saudi Arabia earlier this year. Indeed, so polished are the heir to the throne's dancing skills, he has even earned the praise of dancers, including Campeche local, Carlos Javier Zamorano, 20. Speaking after the dance concluded, Mr Zamorano said that Prince Charles was not only 'really good' at dancing, he also tried hard to get the steps right - despite not knowing them. 'Even though he doesn't know the steps, his dancing was really good - he tried, that's the most important thing,' explained Mr Zamorano. 'For me I'm surprised he did it. If he had more time to practice he would be be very good.' Part of the act: Charles smiles as he gets to grips with the dance, swinging the cloth around his head to the delight of the crowds . In the swing of things: The Prince copied other dancers, among them Carlos Javier Zamorano . Charles' close encounter with Mr Zamorano and his troupe of dancers came as he visited Campeche's main town square, where he was scheduled to tour a number of craft stalls while meeting local dignitaries. The large crowds waiting to see Charles were being entertained by the dance troupe, who were dressed in traditional costumes, when the royal arrived and joined in the dance. Delighted, the crowd roared their approval before the Prince gave one final twirl and moved on, looking thrilled but more than a little relieved. Earlier that day, Charles had visited the Edzna Maya archaeological site and described himself as 'one old ruin in front of another' as he posed for a photo beside it. Relief: Charles laughed as he performed the movements and looked a little relieved when the dance finally came to an end . A huge city complex, Edzna is famous for its enormous, well-preserved temple which is thought to have been completed circa 400 BC and used for more than a thousand years before being abandoned in 1500. The sophisticated complex also boasts a series of surprisingly modern elements, including an expert drainage system and a prehistoric version of a modern rainwater collection scheme. During his visit to the site, Charles was shown around by Alfredo Euan Xool, a Mexican of Maya descent, who showed the royal the site's enormous plaza and  the Great Acropolis, which has five storeys and a row of steep steps leading to the top. 'People of high status lived here, maybe two to three thousand, and the rest of society lived in the surrounding area,' explained Mr Xool after the visit. 'We don't know why they abandoned it, there are theories, maybe there was a drought or maybe the harvest failed for some other reason.' Polished performer: Charles gave his master class in dancing when he visited Campeche's main town square to tour a number of craft stalls and meet local dignitaries . Missing out: Duchess of Cornwall missed out on watching Charles in action after she had to cancel all her engagements on the penultimate day of the couple's Mexican tour because of a sinus problem . High praise: Charles earned the praise of dancer Carlos Javier Zamorano, 20, who joined in to help the Prince along . Silky skills: Teacher Mr Zamorano, 20, said that if the Prince practiced his moves he could be 'very good' One person who didn't manage to make the trip, however, was the Duchess of Cornwall, who was forced to cancel her engagements on the penultimate day of the couple's Mexican tour because of a sinus problem. Clearly unhappy to be without her, Prince Charles offered a brief comment on the health of his, pointing to his ear and saying: 'Sinus, such bad luck'. Charles also altered his schedule to take on some of Camilla's engagements, including a visit to a Women's Justice Centre in Campeche, which provides a refuge for women suffering domestic abuse. There, he was introduced to a lady named Irma and her three young children Omar, David and Jessica, who together had recently escaped from a violent partner in America. Plain sailing: The Prince of Wales also enjoyed a boat trip through the Mangrove Biosphere Reserve in Campeche . Don't rock the boat: Charles sported sunglasses and shielded his eyes from the glare as the boat made its way through the mangroves . Speaking through an interpreter, she told the Prince her story, saying: 'I've just arrived, I was suffering domestic violence, everybody here has been supporting me. 'I'm trying to send my children to school which is a problem for me because I fled from home and don't have any identity papers.' When Charles asked if the centre had helped, she replied: 'Yes. It's been helpful, a lot, when I first escaped I was very afraid, now that's been turned around. As a battered woman I lost everything.' And the Prince finished her sentence, suggesting: 'But regained your self-esteem?' and she replied 'Yes'. Joker: During his visit to the Edzna Maya archaeological site, Charles compared himself to the monument as he posed for a picture, joking 'one old ruin in front of another' Visit: Charles quipped about the weathered state of both himself and the centuries-old Edzna Maya archaeological site as he toured the huge city complex in a jungle clearing . History: Edzna is believed to have been inhabited by the Maya people from around 400BC to the 15th century when some unknown calamity or crucial environmental problem saw it abandoned . He also met Maria, who is also rebuilding her life and her son Angelo Esteban and daughter Cielo de Guadalupe. The woman's son gave the Prince a present meant for the Duchess - a portrait of her made out of coloured card. He told the young boy he would make sure she got it, adding: 'She was so sorry not to have been here to see you.' Before leaving, the Prince posed for a photo with a group of schoolgirls who had danced for him earlier at the centre. They wore traditional colourful costumes and had performed a local piece. Later today the royal couple will visit the city of Monterrey, the business and industrial centre of northern Mexico. They will see a public park - a former steel foundry which showcases the industrial history of the area. Camilla will tour the Santa Lucia river walk by boat, while Charles will meet prominent businesses to discuss social corporate responsibility. A Clarence House spokeswoman said the Duchess hoped to complete her engagements on the final day of the visit. During the day Charles stepped into his wife's shoes to visit a Women's Justice Centre in Campeche, south-west of Mexico City, which provides a refuge for women suffering domestic abuse, and was given a card with a picture of Camilla by a young boy called David .","Prince of Wales joined dancers during his visit to the coastal town of Campeche in Mexico .

Carrick trained for 20 minutes at St George’s Park on Wednesday before limping off with the injury. He was sent for a scan in the afternoon which ruled him out of Saturday’s clash and the friendly against Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday. Carrick later tweeted: '2 steps forward 1 step back Gutted to miss the next 2 @england games, hopefully no more than that though. Missed too much already!!' Tottenham winger Andros Townsend will be assessed  after failing to train for a second successive day because of an ankle injury. The England forward was dragged off at half-time during Spurs’ 2-1 defeat at White Hart Lane against Stoke City on Sunday. Carrick tweeted his frustration on Wednesday evening at being ruled out of the England internationals . Carrick was making a comeback for England after going over a year without playing for Roy Hodgson's side . Hodgson has given Townsend another 24 hours to recover before making a decision on whether he should remain with the squad for the next five days. Carrick was given permission by Van Gaal to join Hodgson’s squad after making his first start of the season against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford last Saturday. Instead the United manager will assess his player when he returns to Carrington on Thursday for a scan. England medical staff believe it is only a minor tear. Carrick shields possession from Liverpool's Raheem Sterling during England training this week . Twenty-four hours before his withdrawal, Carrick had spoken of his pride at earning a recall to the national squad. Asked if he considered retirement following his World Cup snub, he replied: ‘I am only 33 so hopefully I have got a few more years left. It was never something that crossed my mind. I am enjoying things at the moment and I feel good.’ United’s next game is against Arsenal and Van Gaal has a crippling injury list. Defenders Marcos Rojo, Rafael da Silva, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans are all struggling with problems and striker Radamel Falcao continues to be plagued by knee trouble.

"Ginger-haired Australian jihadist Abdullah Elmir, 17, has emerged in a chilling video in which he declares ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land'. In a propaganda video for the terror group published on YouTube, the young white man calling himself Abu Khaled from Australia is flanked by other ISIS fighters. Elmir reportedly told his mother he was 'going fishing' when he disappeared from his home in Bankstown, west Sydney, in June. Elmir and his friend Feiz are believed to have made their way to Syria and Iraq after crossing the border from Turkey, where they were last known to have contacted family members. They travelled via Perth, with stops in Malaysia and Thailand. He begins the video by saying 'this message I deliver to you the people of America, this message I deliver to you the people of Britain and this message I deliver especially to you the people of Australia'. Scroll down for video . Abu Khaled frrom Australia, thought to be Abdullah Elmir, speaks flanked by other ISIS fighters in the latest ISIS propaganda video . Sydney teen Abdullah Elmir reportedly told his mother he was 'going fishing' when he disappeared from his home in Bankstown in June . Titled 'Message Of The Mujahid 4', the video which is 1.43 minutes long is full of heavily worded threats and taunts the US-led coalition that recently began air strikes on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq. 'I say this about your coalition: you threaten us with your countries, bring every nation that you wish to us, bring every nation that you want to come and fight us. Whether it's 50 nations or 50 thousand nations it means nothing to us,' Elmir says. Reading from a script, a black and white scarf wrapped around his head and a huge rifle in his hand, he warns: 'Bring your planes bring everything you want to use because it will not harm us because we have Allah which is something you do not have.' A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Abbott said: 'This video again highlights the threat posed by ISIL.' 'As the Prime Minister has said on many occasions, ISIL is a threat that reaches out to Australia and our allies and partners.' Elmir's family told the Sydney Morning Herald in June they were devastated their son had been 'brainwashed'. His family's lawyer Zali Burrows told the Australian Associated Press: 'The family went to the media today as a plea to the government to bring their boy back. 'We know they have the intelligence to pinpoint him. 'The concern is that he’s being used as a tracking device to gather further intelligence, to see where he's actually going to go.' Ms Burrows questioned how Elmir  was not stopped by Federal Police, who were thought to be monitoring him.

As he finishes his diatribe the men all cheer and chant in Arabic . On Sunday, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced Australia will send its special forces into Iraq to fight against Islamic State. Elmir's video was published one day after the announcement. 'Is it not apparent to you how are these victories possible?,' he asks. 'It comes only from Allah and that is why these small numbers of soldiers that we have we take these massive victories. 'And to the leaders to the Obama, to Tony Abbott, I say to you this: these weapons that we have, these soldiers will not stop fighting, we will not put down our weapons until we reach your lands, until we take the head of every tyrant and until the black flag is flying high in every single land.' Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf is wanted by the Federal Police for his activities in Syria . Former Sydney boxer Mohamed Elomar posted photos of himself holding up decapitated heads on Twitter . The jihadist goes on to claim that ISIS are going to put a 'black flag on top of Buckingham Palace' and the White House. 'We will keep on fighting and we will fight you and defeat you,' he states. As his hate-filled diatribe finishes he begins chanting in Arabic and the fighters around him join in. Monash University terror expert Professor Greg Barton said Abu Khaled was an unknown quantity. 'The big thing is this is the third time Australia's been clearly in the frame,' Prof Barton said. A month ago, Islamic State spokesman Abu Mohammad Al-Adnani urged his followers to murder people of a number of nationalities, including Australians. 'Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him,' Al-Adnani said. Ten days ago, the Islamic State's official magazine, Dabiq, also singled out Australians. 'At this point of the crusade against the Islamic State, it is very important that attacks take place in every country that has entered into the alliance against the Islamic State, especially the US, UK, France, Australia and Germany,' it said. On October 10, a young Australian named Abu Ousama, working as a combat medic for a terror group in Syria, said he is still a 'true blue Aussie' despite condoning the brutal beheadings by ISIS . In this photo a member loyal to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) waves an ISIL flag in Raqqa . Prime Minister Tony Abbott explained on Wednesday that 200 members of the Australian special forces had been waiting in the United Arab Emirates since mid-September to take on ISIS because Baghdad had not offered them formal legal protections. And Australia launched their first air strikes against Islamic State targets inside the country earlier this month as part of the U.S.-led coalition. There are thought to be over 100 Australians fighting with ISIS in the Middle East, including Sydney-born friends Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar. Sharrouf and Elomar have repeatedly taunted the authorities on social media with photos of alleged beheadings of Syrian soldiers. And on October 10, a young Australian named Abu Ousama, working as a combat medic for a terror group in Syria, said he is still a 'true blue Aussie' despite condoning the brutal beheadings by ISIS. Ousama is living among rebel fighters for Jund al-Aqsa. He took part in an interview broadcast on 7News by British photojournalist Tam Hussain who lived with the 1000 strong Islamic battalion group, which is independent of ISIS but supports their ideology. 'ISIS have taken this role of protecting the innocent Muslims of this country, of this land. 'So, they have to do what they need to do to make their state,' he said.

"Rival Bentley last week . reported 37 per cent sales jump . Rolls-Royce has defied the gloom to smash its sales record and boost the British economy. The company, one of the UK’s most prestigious brands, sold 3,538 luxury cars in 2011 – the most in its 107-year history. Bosses at the company said the outstanding performance was a ‘Great British success story’. Great British success story: The front of a Rolls Royce Ghost, at the Rolls Royce factory at Goodwood near Chichester, West Sussex . They said China was the largest market, overtaking the U.S.  for the first time since the launch of the £235,000 Phantom model in 2003. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 47 per cent in 2011 while business in Britain rose by 30 per cent. Rolls-Royce’s announcement came as business leaders warned that the UK economy is at ‘a critical stage’ – but scolded doom-mongers predicting a double-dip recession. ‘A new recession is not a  foregone conclusion,’ insisted John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. Rolls-Royce, which is based in Goodwood, West Sussex, but owned by Germany’s BMW, said sales were driven by booming demand for the Phantom and the £165,000 Ghost. Its sales were 31 per cent higher than in 2010 and eclipsed the previous record set in 1978 in the heyday of the Silver Shadow II. Jobs: A worker fits out the dashboard of a Ghost on the production line at the Rolls-Royce factory . Door to success: Rolls-Royce's sales were 31 per cent higher than in 2010 and eclipsed the previous record set in 1978 in the heyday of the Silver Shadow II . ‘We had an outstanding year in 2011 and we should take a moment to reflect on this Great British success story,’ said Torsten Müller-Ötvös, chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. ‘Our business is in excellent shape. We are developing our dealer network, moving into new markets like South America, expanding our manufacturing operation in West Sussex to meet global demand and plan to develop our product range.’ After China and the U.S., Britain is the third biggest market for Rolls-Royce, followed by the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Rival ultra-luxury car company Bentley, which is owned by Volkswagen and based in Crewe, last week reported a 37 per cent jump in sales to just over 7,000. The surge in exports will be welcomed by ministers, who are relying on demand from overseas to drive economic recovery. A report by the BCC today warns that the economy will stagnate early this year. Mr Longworth said: ‘Action is urgently needed to tackle short-term stagnation and a lack of business confidence, damaged by the ongoing eurozone crisis.’ Defying the downturn: Rolls-Royce said sales were driven by booming demand for the £235,000 Phantom and the £165,000 Ghost . On the up: The record sales follow the announcement last September that Rolls-Royce intends to expand its manufacturing plant at Goodwood in West Sussex . In its Quarterly Economic Survey, the BCC urges ministers to press ahead with plans to slash red tape, reform the planning system, invest in infrastructure and help firms access vital funds as bank lending slumps. ‘A slowdown across the eurozone is inevitable, but Britain need not suffer a similar fate,’ said Mr Longworth. nLingerie chain La Senza went into administration yesterday, leading to the closure of more than 100 outlets and the loss of 1,300 jobs. And in a further blow, bankrupt cross-Channel ferry operator SeaFrance was ordered to close by a French court, resulting in the loss of 127 jobs in Britain.","Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 47 per cent in 2011 .

"Recent studies have revealed a trend for travellers forgoing the old 'fly and flop' holiday, opting instead for more culturally enriching or adventurous experiences abroad. This one certainly would qualify. An independent US-based travel firm are offering photo tours to remote destinations where groups can get up close and personal with wildlife, including these majestic polar bears in Alaska. Inquisitive fellow: A polar bear cub's curiosity is piqued by a wildlife photographer's GoPro camera in Alaska . In the wild: The 35-year-old from Utah runs guided photo tours in the region to get up close and personal with the majestic bears . Breathtaking: Amateur photographers have the opportunity to witness them in their natural habitat . Action Photo Tours, owned and run by 35-year-old David Swindler, takes amateur photographers to the remote Alaskan village of Kaktovik, where an Eskimo guide will lead them for four days to find the majestic animals playing, relaxing and even fighting in their natural habitat. Encounters can range from surly adults to small, playful cubs, and even getting up close and personal with them in the ocean. This video, captured on a GoPro, shows two playful polar bears swimming behind the tour boat. The bears chase the boat, ducking in and out of the water and nosing the curious object as they swim in its wake. Play-fight: Swindler captured the pair of cubs wrestling in the water from his boat . 'What's that over there?' The polar bears noticed the boat with its GoPro and swam over for a closer look . Out for a swim: Photographer David Swindler captured the polar bears near the remote village of Kaktovik . Swindler, from Utah, reveals that he witnessed the pair of two-year-old cubs wrestling in the water for an hour, before they noticed the boat and gave chase. 'One upside to no snow is that the bears seemed to spend more time playing in the water, especially the cubs,' the photographer says. 'They were going at it for a solid hour. Finally, they got curious about our boat and started swimming over. Double the fluffy: The beautiful bears looked like they'd faced-off with a hair dryer after emerging from the water to shake out their coats . 'We started to back away, but they swam even faster. I was taking video with my GoPro camera and they would dive under the water to get a closer look at it. They even touched it with their nose.' The tour also takes in the spectacular Northern Lights at night, and there are options to add on excursions to find a plethora of other wildlife including caribou, musk-oxen, dall sheep, wolves, foxes, and ptarmigan. Expect to splash out for the once-in-a-lifetime experience... the five-day adventure will set you back £4,342 ($6,950). All shapes and sizes: Swindler's photo tours enable amateur photographers to observe both cubs and adults . Natural habitat: Swindler witnessed a mother admonishing her cub for biting her while he was nursing . The next Alaskan tour is scheduled for September 2015, and Mr Swindler recalls that this year's excursion was more challenging due to lack of snow. 'This meant the bears were dirtier since they were rolling around in the dirt. It also made the photography a bit more difficult since the landscape wasn't as pretty,' he says. 'There also wasn't as many bears around since a whale had washed up on shore about 20 miles away and drew quite a few bears over that direction. However, there were still enough bear families on the Barrier Islands and we found plenty to photograph.' Playing dirty: This year's lack of snow meant the polar bears' coats were not as pristine as they rolled about in the dirt . Adventure: The next tour will take place in September 2015 . The former engineer, who gave up his career after a decade to embark on life as a wildlife photographer, has also witnessed heart-warming moments between mother and cub: 'A very hungry cub wanted to nurse from his mom,' Swindler reveals. 'He started to nurse, but it looks like he accidentally bit her. She got very angry and bit his neck. 'In retaliation, he lunged and tried to bite her again. She didn't take that well and bit him a couple more times squarely on the neck. He got the message and was whining and crying for several minutes afterwards. The poor little thing.' Mr Swindler is already planning for next year's polar bears trip to Katovik, where he will lead a photographer group around Barrier Islands and capture the Northern Lights.","Photographer David Swindler encountered polar bear cubs during Eskimo-guided tour .

"It had become one of the most talked about beards in football, but on the eve of Republic of Ireland's clash with Gibraltar, Roy Keane has given his facial hair the razor treatment. It hasn't been just a tidy up, either. The Aston Villa assistant  has completely hacked off his beard to leave behind an almost fresh-faced Keane.

"Chelsea are set to cash in on World Cup-winning misfit Andre Schurrle. Both Wolfsburg and Borussia Dortmund are in the running for the winger, who has struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge this season. But far from a cut-price deal for a talented bench warmer, the Blues will expect compensation to the tune of £30million for Schurrle, who has made just five Premier League starts this season. The move continues a trend of Chelsea getting top dollar for players unwanted since Jose Mourinho’s return and the introduction of FFP rules. Here, Sportsmail runs the rule over the big-name departures. Andre Schurrle looks set to leave Chelsea before the end of the transfer window on February 2 . Schurrle is wanted by both Wolfsburg and Borussia Dortmund back home in the Bundesliga . January 2014 – Kevin de Bruyne £18million . Hotly-touted De Bruyne never saw eye-to-eye with Mourinho since returning from a successful loan spell at Werder Bremen on the Portuguese manager’s return to Stamford Bridge. Despite featuring in the first few matches of last season, the Belgian playmaker soon fell out of favour, with Mourinho slamming his attitude and performance in a Capital One Cup win at Swindon. He barely featured for Chelsea again, the manager frequently becoming irritable in press conferences when asked about his non-appearances. When the January transfer window rolled around, De Bruyne was first out the door, with Chelsea incredibly banking well over double their money for a player with just two league appearances to his name. Kevin de Bruyne left Chelsea for £18million while Juan Mata arrived at Manchester United for £37million . Manager Jose Mourinho has seen an incredible amount of money flood into the club over the last year . January 2014 – Juan Mata - £37million . A fans favourite straight from the off when arriving from Valencia in 2011, Mata lit up Stamford Bridge with his creativity, eye for goal and cheery demeanour. The diminutive Spaniard led the Blues’ attacking play throughout his tenure of the No 10 shirt, picking up the FA Cup, the Champions League and the Europa League trophies along the way. However, the Special One’s return was the beginning of the end for Special Juan. Mourinho had no time for Mata’s perceived lack of tracking back, and some anaemic displays saw Willian take his place in the side. Enter Manchester United. David Moyes saw an opportunity to snap up an unhappy, albeit outrageously talented, player, but had to pay £37million for the privilege. Mata has been good in fits and starts at Old Trafford, but is often touted as the odd man out in Louis van Gaal’s star-studded attacking line-up. Mata hasn't been an unqualified success at United and Mourinho will be pleased with the business . David Luiz cost PSG a staggering £50million . June 2014 – David Luiz - £50million . A player who polarised opinion at Stamford Bridge like no other. The big-haired Brazilian left fans in raptures with his fearless play, impeccable technique and larger-than-life personality. Unfortunately, he also left fans with their heads in their hands at some of his ponderous positional play and dodgy defending. Mourinho deployed Luiz in both defence and midfield last season to varying degrees of success. But when Paris St Germain came calling with an eye-watering £50million, there was no hesitation at Chelsea. His World Cup performances alongside PSG clubmate Thiago Silva did nothing to disprove the notion that Chelsea got the deal of the century. July 2014 – Romelu Lukaku - £28million . Hailed as the heir to Didier Drogba, Lukaku arrived at Stamford Bridge amid a flurry of hype as one of the most coveted teenagers in Europe. Luiz plays alongside Brazilian national team-mate Thiago Silva in the heart of PSG's back four . Everton decided to part with £28million when signing Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea last summer . Lukaku was brilliant on loan at Goodison Park last season but has since struggled for form . Goal-laden loan spells at West Brom and then Goodison Park had Chelsea fans looking on in anguish as their own misfiring strikers stunk out the Premier League. But Mourinho had issues with Lukaku’s attitude and technique – the target man’s passing and first touch some way off what was required for the Chelsea attacking juggernaut. Getting a shade under £30million for him from loan club Everton has proven to be a masterstroke. The Toffees have been a shadow of Roberto Martinez’s men last season, with the Belgian target man one of the worst culprits.","Andre Schurrle is interesting both Wolfsburg and Dortmund .

"The Department of Justice has 40 FBI agents canvassing Ferguson, Missouri to learn whether a white police officer should be charged with a 'civil rights' crime for shooting an unarmed black teen, the agency confirmed on Tuesday. Reporters in Missouri have tallied up stories from at least 12 witnesses who back the account of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown, 18, last week. Still, a civil rights verdict against Wilson could subject him to execution under federal law. The DOJ is conducting interviews with an eye toward determining if a federal case will be made of the shooting, regardless of whether the state of Missouri charges Wilson with murder or manslaughter. It's conceivable that he might not be charged for killing the teen, but still face a trial in federal court for violating his civil rights. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Attorney General Eric Holder (right) will visit Ferguson, Missouri on Wednesday to brief FBI investigators who are on the ground investigating the Michael Brown shooting with an eye toward civil rights charges . Monday night mayhem: Law enforcement officers on West Florissant Avenue in Ferguson, Missouri fired tear gas after shots rang out during another night of unrest just hours after Obama called for calm but hinted he won't show up there . Obama was asked directly on Monday if he's considered going to Ferguson, but he never answered the question . Americans who act 'under color of law' – including police officers – to deprive a person of his constitutional rights 'by reason of his color, or race' can be convicted of violating the civil rights law. 'And if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section,' the law reads, offenders can be 'imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.' Attorney General Eric Holder will pay a visit to the Missouri flashpoint zone on Wednesday. 'I intend to meet with FBI investigators, and prosecutors on the ground from the Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney’s Office officials about the ongoing investigation,' Holder . said Monday in a statement. 'As . I informed the president this afternoon, the full resources of the Department of . Justice are being committed to our federal civil rights investigation . into the death of Michael Brown.' 'During . the day today,' he added, 'more than 40 FBI agents continued their canvassing of . the neighborhood where Michael Brown was shot.' Brown's . grandfather also demanded on Monday that Barack Obama visit him there . personally, but Obama had dodged a question hours earlier about whether . he'll make the trip. And . Democrats in Congress are reluctant to ask the president to go – . sticking with political loyalties instead of putting him on the hot . seat. Les McSpadden spoke to Al Sharpton on MSNBC . Monday night, saying that Obama owes him a visit to calm the waters . after his grandson met his end on a Ferguson street after an alleged . strong-arm robbery. 'America . is built on people coming together at times like this, and now is the . time for my president to step forward,' McSpadden told the community . organizer-turned-TV-host. 'I want to say this to my President: I voted . for you, so you ought to be able to meet with me.' So far, though, Obama's allies in the Congressional Black Caucus are declining the opportunity to pressure him into going. Michael  Browns grandfather (at right) challenged President Barack Obama to meet with him in Ferguson, Mo., despite his apparent lack of enthusiasm for making the trip . Battle lines: Obama says he wants to be careful about weighing in on the controversy, but many in Ferguson are making their opinions known . Obama . himself ducked the question on Monday during a press conference at the . White House after a reporter asked him, 'Have you considered going . yourself?' He dodged by suggesting he didn't want to get directly involved when a federal investigation into the shooting is underway. 'I have to be very careful about not prejudging these events before investigations are completed,' the president said. Instead, he said his role would be 'to get at those root causes' of race-based civil unrest – a nod to his 'My Brother's Keeper' initiative, aimed at black men. Obama is sending Attorney General Eric Holder to Ferguson in his stead. The nation's top law enforcement official – also, like Obama, an African-American – will arrive Wednesday. MailOnline reached out to a dozen members of the black caucus, all African-American federal lawmakers. None would offer even a hint of suggestion that Obama should make the trip himself, and none would speak on the record. Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver said Monday on MSNBC that 'I don't think the president needs to come to Ferguson. 'It adds another distortion. We don't need that now.' But that has been the only weigh-in from a black member of Congress, even as the St. Louis suburb's streets have become a virtual war zone amid racial tensions. All the . chaos, one congressional aide to a Black Caucus member told MailOnline, . is leading congressmen and women to keep their powder dry. Standing room: Reporters crowded into the White House briefing room on Monday to hear a haggard and detached Obama call for peace . 'No . one wants to be the one who demands Obama come down there, and then . things get worse. Everybody loses that way, and this is a killer . election year,' the staffer said on condition of anonymity. Four . press secretaries said plainly, but only on background, that their . bosses would be steering clear of the controversy entirely. Brown, 18, was shot six times as he allegedly charged a white police officer, drawing riots from the black community in Ferguson – and an aggressive police reaction complete with military vehicles and arms provided by the federal government. A tired-looking Obama said Monday that the law enforcement's paramilitary show of force could indicate that the Pentagon has gone too far in outfitting police forces with surplus gear. 'There is a big difference between our military and our local law enforcement, and we don't want those lines blurred,' the president said at the White House. 'That would be contrary to our tradition.' But he has no plans to visit what has become the latest Ground Zero in America's continuing racial divide. Protesters, police there have said, have come from as far away as New York and California to engage in angry demonstrations and confront police. As many as 31 were arrested Monday night, according to in-charge Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson. A reporter tweeted a photo of a card that FBI agents are handing out near the scene of the Brown shooting .","Government dragnet descends on Ferguson looking for a federal criminal case; the federal statute allows for the execution of offenders who kill .

"An SUV driver who allegedly deliberately ran over and killed a Muslim teenager outside a Missouri mosque had an anti-Islamic message painted on the rear window of his car, police have said. Ahmed Aden, 34, is accused of intentionally swerving into Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein, 15, as he climbed into a silver car outside the Somali Center in Kansas City on Thursday evening. He struck the  teenager - also known as 'Adam' - at high speed, nearly severing his legs. The victim was rushed to hospital with serious blood loss. But despite medics' best efforts, he shortly died. Now, police have revealed that Aden had scrawled the words: 'Quran is a virus disease woreste than Ebola (sic)' in white paint on the back of his car before crashing into the unsuspecting teenager. Scroll down for video . 'Hate crime': Ahmed Aden (left), 34, is accused of deliberately running over and killing Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein (right), 15, as he climbed into a car outside a Kansas City mosque at around 5.20pm on Thursday . Anti-Islamic: Police have revealed that Aden had scrawled the words: 'Quran is a virus disease woreste than Ebola (sic)' in white paint on the rear window of his black SUV (pictured) before crashing into the teenager . In an email, Kansas City police spokesman, Darin Snapp, told The Associated Press that the suspect's black SUV had been seen cruising around the area by patrol officers in late October. It had already been painted with the message comparing the Quran to the deadly Ebola virus, he said. The disease has so far killed more than 5,000 people, mainly in three West African nations. According to Fox 4 News, the suspect had also been harassing the mosque's Muslim community with anti-Islamic taunts and violent threats and messages in the months leading up to the 'murder'. 'One of the messages was that Islam is worse than Ebola,' 13-year-old Mohamed Ahmed, of Kansas City, said. ''I would have thought the police would have taken care of it, but they didn't.' Abdisamad, a sophomore, was reportedly heading to play basketball on Thursday when Aden crashed into him so violently that he 'flew through the air', according to a probable cause affidavit. Following the smash at 5.20pm, Aden, a convenience store manager and local Somali of Christian faith, reportedly ran over the teenager's body, before stepping out of the SUV brandishing a knife. SUV: In an email, Kansas City police spokesman, Darin Snapp, told The Associated Press that the suspect's black SUV (pictured after the crash) had been seen cruising around the area by patrol officers late October . Fatal: Aden struck the teenager - also known as 'Adam' - at high speed, nearly severing his legs. The victim was rushed to hospital with severe injuries, but shortly died. Above, the car Abdisamad was climbing into . Scene: The crash occurred outside the mosque (above) near Admiral Boulevard in Kansas City on Thursday . When police arrived at the scene, he started swinging around what appeared to be a baseball bat, it is said. One witness told officers Aden threatened them with a handgun as he tried to flee on foot. Abdisamad, who was rushed into surgery at Children’s Mercy Hospital following the incident, was taken off life support by his family later that evening after doctors declared him to be brain dead. On Friday, Aden was charged with first-degree murder for the crash, which the FBI is investigating as a potential hate crime. He is currently being held in Jackson County jail. FBI spokesman, Bridget Patton, said: 'Federal agents are assisting in the investigation and have opened this matter as a federal civil rights investigation as a potential hate crimes violation.' Victim: Abdisamad (left and right), from Missouri, was reportedly heading to play basketball on Thursday when Aden crashed into him so violently that he 'flew through the air', according to a probable cause affidavit . Bowed in prayer: Somali men gather to pray the day after the 15-year-old was allegedly struck by Aden . On Saturday afternoon, a funeral for Abdisamad - who led prayers at the mosque near Admiral Blvd and The Paseo the night before his death - was held at the Islamic Society of Greater Kansas City. It came a day after dozens of the victim's grief-stricken friends and family members gathered for a prayer service, where Abdisamad was remembered for being kind and faithful. After the service, Mohamed Farah, 50, a  friend of the boy's family, told reporters he had called police more than once in October about Aden, who was 'acting suspiciously' around the mosque. 'I feel like I lost a part of my body,' he said, referring to Abdisamad's death. Bakar Abdalla, 31, of Kansas City, added that Aden had been frequenting the area with hateful messages, describing the suspect as 'a bullet in a gun waiting to be triggered'. Meanwhile, Khadra Dirir, the victim's aunt, said her nephew often studied the Quran and had given a group prayer the night he died. 'If you asked him a verse, he could tell the chapter,' she said. According to the probable cause affidavit, Aden initially told authorities that he had lost control of his vehicle and accidentally swerved into the Staley High School sophomore. However, he later claimed he crashed into the teenager because he thought the boy looked like someone who had threatened him several days earlier, it is said. No attorney was listed for Aden in online court records.

"Her wardrobe was the envy of millions of women across the globe. And it seems the appetite for Princess Diana's glamorous dresses has not subsided. Five dresses designed for and worn by the late British royal have gone under the hammer in Los Angeles for a total of nearly half a million dollars. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Five dresses designed for Princess Diana have sold for $500,000, 17 years after she sold them . For bidders on a lower budget, letters, crockery and a pair of cuff-links commemorating Diana and Prince Charles's wedding were also up for auction. Three of the gowns were made by British dressmaker Catherine Walker, Diana's personal couturier and close friend for 16 years. A cream lace dress designed by Zandra Rhodes and worn by Diana in 1987 to the Birthright Benefit at the London Palladium was also up for grabs. And the surprise of the night came from a Caroline Charles burgundy wool coat dress, which was expected to go for $20-40,000 but scored a total of $125,000. The collection was originally sold in Paris in 1997 - a month before Diana's death in the French capital at the age of 36. Under the hammer: This cream lace dress designed by Zandra Rhodes (left) and worn by Diana in 1987 to the Birthright Benefit at the London Palladium (right) fetched $100,000 at Julien's Auctions on Friday in Los Angeles . Now, 20 years later, the anonymous winners decided to hand the lucrative gowns to Julien's Auctions. The Zandra Rhodes evening gown created for Diana, which was estimated to sell for $80-100,000, went for $100,000. The Catherine Walker dresses all fetched within or just above their estimated price of between $60,000 and $80,000. An off-the-shoulder petal pink gown embellished with bands of simulated pearls, faceted glass and beadwork, worn by Diana in 1993 to the Savoy Theatre in London, went for $75,000. Also on offer was a strapless ivory silk crepe dress which went for $76,800, while a chartreuse silk georgette gown worn by Diana in 1993 fetched $81,250.

Ms Walker, who died in 2012 after a long battle with cancer, worked tirelessly to create over 1,000 outfits for Diana; from right after her 1981 wedding to Prince Charles, to until her death in 1997. According to a friend of Miss Walker, journalist Alison Jane Reid - who wrote an in-depth story about her for MailOnline in 2010 - the Princess and the designer were close, and their relationship founded on 'loyalty and total discretion.' Reid wrote: 'After Diana’s separation from Prince Charles in 1992, clothes became even more important to her. 'Together, the two women devised a joint strategy of ‘defiant’ frocks - body-conscious but without vulgarity - that Diana wore in separation and divorce.' Four other items which belonged to the late princess also went under the hammer in Beverly Hills.

"Darren Fletcher's 20-year association with Manchester United came to end on Monday, when he joined West Brom on a three-and-a-half year deal. During his 342 appearances for the club, the midfielder's honours include four Premier League titles and a Champions League triumph. It's safe to say the 31-year-old's displays on-and-off the pitch have cemented his place in the hearts of the Old Trafford faithful but United blogger, and www.90min.com contributer, Scott Saunders discusses why the timing of the Scotland international's departure is  correct for both the player and the club. Football can be an unforgiving business, especially at the world's top clubs. That's exactly how it is at Manchester United. Times change, people change, teams evolve and priorities alter. And the latest case in point came when it was confirmed Darren Fletcher was leaving United for West Bromwich Albion, in one of the final deals of transfer deadline day. The move closed the book on a storied United career for the Scot - one lined with triumphs, adversity and uncertainty. He spent 20 years of not only his career, but his life, connected with the club. The Scot will always remain a favourite with United's supporters after growing up, and growing older under their watchful eye, but for all parties, there's little getting away from the fact that his decision to leave was the right one. United manager Louis van Gaal, as well as the player himself, deserve a huge amount of credit for having the foresight to make the deal happen. West Brom confirmed the signing of Darren Fletcher on a three and a half year deal late on deadline day . Fletcher enjoyed a memorable 12 years at Manchester United in which he appeared 342 times . Sir Alex Ferguson personally secured the signature of the young Scot amid interest from other clubs . United's official Twitter account wished him well . Like it or not - and yes, they have spent nearly £200m over the last year - United are still a team in transition. Big money has been spent, but the operation is far from complete. This procedure involves as many outgoings as incomings. It's been glaringly obvious that United have needed a clear out for a number of years. Sir Alex Ferguson failed to sift through the hordes of players at his disposal in his final days with the club - and David Moyes baulked at the idea too - but Van Gaal is not shying away. While a host of players left last summer, other dead wood like £26m flop Anderson was thrown out this winter. That's not to say Fletcher is 'dead wood' - in fact, it'd be extremely harsh to suggest. The newly-turned 31-year-old had plenty to offer for the rest of this season. Boasting a number of Premier League winners' medals, great leadership skills and unmatched determination, Fletcher could have taught some of the new crop a thing or two. And that hunger to play was only increased after his long battle with ulcerative colitis put him on the shelf for around two years. His desire to play though could not be fulfilled at his boyhood club any longer. Van Gaal conceded he didn't want to let Fletcher leave, but with an expiring contract at the end of June and a number of competitors for his spot in the team, Fletcher did not want to waste any more time. And he's made it happen. For him, regular Premier League football beckons once more. While Fletcher's departure may mean that United lose a small part of their identity, it’s probably the right decision and it’s what's best for the player. The rebuild at United can continue and Fletcher can continue his career. Fletcher has revealed that United boss Louis van Gaal was reluctant to see him leave Old Trafford . Fletcher (second left) is mobbed by team-mates including Wayne Rooney after scoring  during a pre-season friendly against Valencia, however, he went on to appear just 13 times this season with only five starts . Fletcher (left) celebrates Premier League success with Manchester United alongside  Rooney in 2009 . Fletcher's move has't garnered the attention that met Cristiano Ronaldo's world-record departure, but nobody will be more sorely missed than the 31-year-old Scotland international .

"Paul Scholes believes Diego Costa should be admired for his patience on the football pitch rather than criticised for his tough tackling attitude. The Spain international is facing an immediate three-match ban for his apparent stamp on the Liverpool's Emre Can during Tuesday's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge. Costa was later involved in a second stamping furore involving Liverpool's Slovakian defender Martin Skrtel, but the FA said they would not take any action over that incident.

Despite Costa's fiery temper, Manchester United legend Scholes claims the Blues striker should be shown more respect after 'extreme provocation' from Skrtel. Writing in his column for the Independent, Scholes said: 'As for Diego Costa, I see it differently to the rest. 'I thought his actions were at the lower end of the scale of dangerous and that he was under extreme provocation from Martin Skrtel, who has wound him up before this season. The Spain forward was training with Chelsea on Thursday after being charged by the FA for stamping on Can . Manchester United legend Paul Scholes believes Costa should actually be admired for his patience . 'My view of it was that Costa gets kicked a lot and actually his patience is to be admired in many, if not all, situations.' Costa is contesting the FA's charge for violent conduct, but will miss crucial Premier League clashes against Manchester City, Aston Villa and Everton should the charge stand. The disciplinary case is now set to be heard by an independent regulatory commission on Friday, which will make a final ruling over whether Costa must serve the suspension for his charge.

"U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder took to ABC's 'This Week' Sunday morning to blast conservative personality and former Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, in response to her editorial calling for the impeachment of President Obama. 'She wasn't a particularly good vice presidential candidate' said Holder on the political talk show, speaking to host George Stephanopoulos.  'She's an even worse judge of who ought to be impeached and why.' Holder's comments were responses to an editorial written by Palin and published last week on Breitbart.com, entitled 'It's Time to Impeach President Obama.' US Attorney General Eric Holder (pictured left) took aim at a recent op-ed by Sarah Palin (pictured right), in which the conservative personality advocated for the impeachment of President Obama . Palin's article asserts that Obama is purposefully weakening the border security between the United States and Mexico, and declares it grounds for impeachment proceedings to begin. 'Enough is enough of the years of abuse from this president,' she opened her op-ed with. 'His unsecured border crisis is the last straw that makes the battered wife say, ""no mas.”' Holder responded with disdain for Palin's criticisms, also denouncing 'gridlocked Washington' and the Republican Party's continuing efforts to block any initiatives from the Obama Administration. 'For whatever reason, [some] Republicans decided early on that this was a . president they were just simply not going to cooperate with,' Holder told ABC News' Pierre Thomas in a rare interview. 'And over the . past five-and-a-half years, we have seen demonstrations of that, where . the president has reached out his hand, offered compromises that have . simply not been met [in the way] they have been in the past by a . Republican Party willing to do the appropriate things.' Holder on ABC's 'This Week,' where he also criticized the Republican lawsuit against Obamacare and defended himself against accusations that he should be impeached for declining to appoint a special prosecutor to handle investigation of the IRS scandal . Holder also dismissed calls for himself to be impeached due to declining to appoint a special prosecutor to deal with the latest IRS scandal involving former executive Lois Lerner and allegations of  targeting of conservative politicians and covering it up. Holder insisted that hiring a special prosecutor was not necessary, and FBI agents investigating the allegations were 'doing a good, professional job.' In Palins op-ed, she claimed that a lax approach by Obama in the enforcement of border security is allowing illegal immigrants to flood the country and irreparably damage the middle class by adding an undue burden on various American resources. Palin also warned that without action now, Obama's 'lawlessness' would worsen. 'It’s not going to get better, and in fact irreparable harm can be done . in this lame-duck term as he continues to make up his own laws as he . goes along, and, mark my words, will next meddle in the U.S. Court . System with appointments that will forever change the basic . interpretation of our Constitution’s role in protecting our rights.' She concluded her op-ed with 'The many impeachable offenses of Barack Obama can no longer be ignored. If after all this he’s not impeachable, then no one is.' In the ABC interview, Holder commented that he believed that some level of racism was involved with the cries of Republicans to impeach both himself and Obama. Holder contended that the criticisms of himself and Obama (pictured) have some basis in 'racial animus' 'There's a certain level of vehemence, it seems to me, that's directed . at me [and] directed at the president,' Holder said. 'You know, people . talking about taking their country back. … There's a certain racial . component to this for some people. I don’t think this is the thing that . is a main driver, but for some there's a racial animus.' House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and other Republican leaders have said that they do not support calls for Obama's impeachment. Boehner does support a lawsuit filed against the Affordable Care Act, which Holder also lambasted in his interview. 'It's a more, I think, a political gesture than a truly legal one,' Holder . said. 'Filing a lawsuit against the president that has no basis is not . going to improve the quality of life for the American people.'","Holder was responding to a July 8 op-ed by Sarah Palin published on Breitbart.com, in which she claimed that Obama's lax policies regarding border control were grounds for impeachment .

"North Korea tour company, Experience North Korea, is showing for the first time at next week's World Travel Market in London. Not only is the Shanghai-based operator facing the usual challenge of promoting trips to the unpopular Communist country, but now, it's attempting to do so when North Korea has just closed its borders due to the Ebola scare. Nevertheless, the tour company remains optimistic ahead of their four day stint at the ExCeL exhibition centre. Shanghai-based North Korean tour company, Experience North Korea, will show for the first time at next week's World Travel Market exhibition in London . The company will be faced with a particularly hard sell this year as the unpopular Communist country has just closed its borders in the wake of the world Ebola scare . Nathalie Armengol, the owner of Experience North Korea, says: 'While we have not yet been given a timescale for the reopening of the border, we have been reassured it is a temporary issue until measures are put in place.' North Korea has never been a particularly easy sell as a tourist destination, as visitors are unable to travel there on their own and there are no mobile phone communications. Upon arrival, government tour guides accompany visitors at all time. Still, Armengol insists that visits are 'not only possible, but safe.' 'We want to change people's minds about North Korea,' she says. 'People are really surprised when they visit. You have to respect the rules and stay with your guides but you will see amazing beauty and untouched nature.' However, owner of Experience North Korea, Nathalie Armengol, insists that the border will open again soon . Nathalie insists visits to North Korea are 'safe' and that the tour company hopes to 'change people's minds' Many who visit North Korea are also surprised by the untouched nature and countryside, Nathalie says . The four-day travel trade exhibition begins on Monday, November 3 and is one of the largest tourism events in the world. A recent holiday confidence survey released ahead of the World Travel Market shows that there is a growing desire among job-secure Britons to plan overseas holidays within the next 12 months. But potential holidaymakers are still keeping an eye on their wallets - the amount individuals are expected to spend on trips will likely increase only marginally. From foreign exchange company First Rate Exchange and the Institute of Travel & Tourism, the survey showed that 10 per cent of the 5,017 adults polled planned to take more holidays over the next 12 months. 37 per cent intend to take two trips abroad compared with a figure of 35 per cent a year ago. But 24 per cent felt their holiday plans could be affected should interest rates rise.","Experience North Korea will show for first time at World Travel Market .

"Bassem, the husband of Mahassen Issa, who is facing court in Lebanon, has spoken of his heartbreak . The husband of the Australian woman charged in Lebanon with either adultery or bigamy has spoken out about his devastation at learning his wife had married another man before divorcing him. Bassem, a custom-made furniture designer from Sydney's west, said he and Mahassen Issa were married for 10 years before she went to Lebanon and began a relationship with Mohammad Awick. 'I love her so much, I'd do anything, why has she done this?' he told Daily Mail Australia. Bassem also expressed outrage that his wife had married another man before their divorce was finalised and had 'deserted our children'. 'She’s a devil. This lady, she’s a devil,' he said. Bassem acknowledged the couple had been having problems, saying that he had moved out of their home on April 13 and had begun divorce proceedings. But he denied her claims they had been separated since last September, saying they went on a holiday to Queensland together in February to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. His comments come as Ms Issa faces a Lebanese court after leaving her husband for a holiday with another man, Mohammad Awick. Ms Issa was due to return to Sydney last weekend but said she was contacted by police and informed that her passport had been flagged and she was not able to leave the country. Ms Issa said she had been charged with adultery, which is a criminal offence in Lebanon, and could face a six-month prison sentence. Her family insist that she has been charged with bigamy and have provided photographs to Daily Mail Australia that they claim show Ms Issa and Mr Awick at their wedding three weeks ago. Bassem posted side-by-side pictures on Facebook of Ms Issa with him (left) and with Mohammad Awick (right), whom he claims Ms Issa married in Lebanon three weeks ago . A photo from Mahassen Issa's second wedding to Mohammad Awick which happened three weeks ago, her family claim . Bassem (pictured here with the couple's two children) and Ms Issan were in the process of getting a divorce when she travelled to Lebanon . Bassem claims that his wife met Mohammad Awick, who lives in Lebanon, through the Internet, and has been talking to him since last year. 'I found out from the phone bill, she's been talking to him before. I don't know what's going on behind my back,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Bassem said his wife married Mr Awick in Lebanon three weeks ago despite his requests to divorce him first and do things properly. 'I found out from her brother. We told her and we told him, ''First divorce me and then do what you want''.' 'I'm still her husband here and she has married another man.' Bassem said that when he learnt his wife went through with the wedding, he sent his papers to Lebanon to inform them Ms Issa had committed bigamy. 'I sent all my papers to Lebanon saying ""We're still married and you have to stop her"". 'It's not up to me now. People say to me, ""Why don't you drop the charges?"" But if I drop the charges, the Lebanese government will charge her. 'I think that she should go to jail. She's been my wife for 10 years and she's a very good lady. But she needs a lesson that she needs to do the right thing. 'When she wakes up from this dream she will understand what she's done is wrong. She left everything. She left her family, she left her kids, she left her work, she left her friends.  For what? To be happy for a few weeks.' 'Now she's crying to make Australia feel sorry for her.' Bassem shared his heartbreak with friends on Facebook earlier this month, posting a picture of himself and Ms Issa alongside a picture of Ms Issa and Mr Awick, with the caption: 'Is it halal for a married women to get remarried while she is still married?'

Ms Issa's family have disowned her for starting the relationship. Her brother, Ahmmad, has told Daily Mail Australia: 'We want nothing to do with her. She is a compulsive liar.' 'She's disregarded her kids and disregarded her family, and gone off and married someone she had only known for 48 hours,' Mr Issa said. Ms Issa's brother said the family had warned Ms Issa about marrying Mr Awick after her ex-husband registered their marriage in Lebanon. 'We tried to put a stop to it but she decided to proceed with her marriage in Lebanon...now it has backfired on her,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'She's not going to jail because of adultery, she's going to jail because she got married while she was still married. 'That's illegal everywhere, not just in Lebanon. All she's doing is crying out for Australia to help her. 'We told her not to get married three weeks ago, we told her she would get in trouble and look what happened,' he said. Ms Issa said she and her husband separated last September and that she and her new partner (pictured) have not done anything wrong . Ms Issa said she and Mr Awick have received threats and are fearful of what their futures hold . But Ms Issa protests her innocence, saying she and her estranged husband were in the middle of divorce proceedings in Australia. 'I came to Lebanon because I was going through a very messy divorce, I met my partner, we fell in love,' she told 9NEWS. 'I haven't broken any laws and I'm a victim of a jealous spouse's revenge plot.' Ms Issa who was born in Sydney and attended Wiley Park High School has two children, a six-year-old son and a nine-year-old daughter, and she said she fears not being able to return to them. 'The thought of not seeing my children again and my whole family disowning me, it's too much,' she told The Daily Telegraph. The children are currently being cared for by their father in Sydney's west. Ms Issa says she separated from her husband in September last year, though her husband claims they did not separate until April 2014. Ms Issa said she and Mr Awick have been receiving threats and she does not know who to turn to for assistance. 'The holiday that I thought would just be some time out has turned into a nightmare… we have done nothing wrong,' she told The Daily Telegraph. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that they were providing consular assistance to a woman trying to return from Lebanon to Australia.","Mahassen Issa, 29, is facing court in Tripoli.

"A competitive eater has chewed his way through the UK's most prolific eating challenges consuming more than 200,000 calories. Ravenous Randy Santel, 28, conquered a 92oz steak challenge, a 60oz burger and 27in pizzas for his eating marathon. The mountain man from Missouri, who stands at 6ft 5in, finished 42 UK challenges including British traditional feasts such as full English breakfasts and fish and chips. Scroll down for video . Randy Santel, 28, traveled from Missouri to the UK to take part in 42 UK food challenges which saw him eat a whopping 200,000 calories. Here he is dong the English Breakfast challenge in Barnsley at Baileys cafe . He devoured a jaw-dropping 205lb of food since his journey began and based on the average calorie intake for men - 2,500 a day - Randy has nearly doubled his daily calorie allowance in just one meal. Randy said: 'At home around 70 per cent of the challenges are big burgers, so here I tried to tackle British food including my new favourite meal, bangers and mash. 'My favourite challenge so far has been a 12in burger the size of a mini cooper wheel with 200g of chips. 'Everyone was cheering my name, more than a hundred people watched and I even made front page news. He continued: 'The Brits I've met along the way have been really supportive some even letting me stay with them, I think they're amazed I've travelled so far to take on these challenges. 'One minute I was battling a food challenge next thing I'm at a stranger's home playing Xbox with their son and all because I can eat. It's crazy but great that everyone's been so welcoming.' On one of the 42 days Randy chewed his way through another giant breakfast challenge complete with toast, eggs, beans, hash browns, chips, sausages, mushrooms, bacon, sausages and black pudding . For this challenge which is called the 'Bagel Boy' Randy had to eat cheesy, beany chips and a giant stuffed bagel . His final challenge saw him battle a stack of five burgers stacked between five pieces of bacon and five pieces of cheese, with a side portion of chips and coleslaw at Scotty's Steakhouse, Galway. The epic meal named the Scotty's 5x5 challenge tallies up a whopping total of 9,000 calories, which is nearly four times the recommended amount of calories a man should consume in one day. Beating the challenge makes him one of 16 people to finish the meal in the half hour time limit as Randy scoffed it  in 18 minutes 28 seconds. He surpassed his target of reaching the milestone of 250 extreme food victories across the United States and Europe after starting his one-a-day attempts in December. By comparison, former competitive eater Adam Richman from TV Programme Man Versus Food, completed 48 in two years. Randy says the most challenging eat on his tour was four individual foot-long breakfast sandwiches and a bowl of chips at Mac's Café in Burton-upon-Trent. At the Hobgoblin in Bristol Randy ate his way through The Kraken Burger challenge which includes dirty fries, a pile of wings and a giant burger . Randy said: 'Competitive eating isn't something that everybody can do, most professionals only do three challenges a month - I did one every day with only a couple days of rest. 'I can almost tell you what time I'll finish before my first bite, I know what my body can do so I can work out my tactics from there. 'You wouldn't face a giant burger in the same way you battle a dessert challenge, but with both of them you have to know you can finish it. 'I don't think anyone in the world could beat the macaroni and cheese challenge I lost, there was a tray full, it was too much, and I barely made it through half.' Randy, who has a construction management degree, believes his insatiable appetite started at an early age, at one point weighed more than 23-stone before losing weight through body building. At Tonys Pizzeria in Glasgow Randy decided to chow down on this 27 inch pizza . He added: 'I never thought I'd have seen these amazing sights when I was behind a desk in construction jobs, so to have eaten through 75 per cent of the UK's toughest challenges fills me with pride. 'I was sceptical about whether I'd make it but I kept pushing and my body stayed strong, I did it!' Randy also appeared in US TV show, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, after winning a Men's Health competition for men to transform their bodies into that of a muscle-clad Spartan in 12 weeks. Randy lost two stone in two months, dropped down to 16st, but still found he had an impressive appetite for large meals. He said: 'After winning the competition me and a buddy took on a meat challenge and shocked the owners by completing it, that's when I realised I wanted to pursue this seriously. 'I get my eating from my dad, we were always very hungry men - there's a big joke in my family about there never being any leftovers. As well as being a competitive eater Randy took part in the US TV show Spartacus: Gods of the Arena after winning a competition with Men's Health to transform his body in 12 weeks . Randy gets ready to build a burger with a bun the size of a loaf of bread . 'My grandma would tease me saying that I could slow down as no one was trying to steal my food, I think that was an early sign growing up that I could conquer such epic food challenges. 'I was following a career in construction but I'm glad I've converted and can't wait to keep taking on large meals, I feel like it was what I was born to do. 'When I feel full I remember the other billions of people who hate their job, like I used to, who wish they don't have to do it which puts it into perspective - basically I'm eating, working out and travelling - I can't complain. Back at home in St Peters, Missouri, the competitive eater will be downsizing his meals and opting for healthier options to counterbalance the high calorific intake. Randy said: 'I'll be on a diet from now on to lose any weight I've gained and to let my body recover, so it'll be back to vegetables for me for a good while.' 'It will be back to canned vegetables and sandwiches for me now - it's a world away from my eating challenges.' In Bromsgrove Randy tried the Big Davs breakfast challenge eating a breakfast sandwich made from a whole loaf of bread . At the Amalfis Italian Lounge in Darwen Randy tried the 27 Metro Pizza challenge .","Randy Santel, 28, came to the UK from Missouri to tackle food challenges .

"Nigel Pearson can expect a call from the League Managers’ Association following the verbal exchange with a fan during Leicester’s midweek defeat against Liverpool. While LMA chief Richard Bevan prepares to get involved, Pearson is armed with the knowledge that both dressing room and boardroom are united behind him as far as the abusive spat is concerned. The Leicester manager will escape disciplinary action for an incident which is becoming increasingly common in the Premier League, hence Bevan’s interest. Nigel Pearson stands on the touchline during the defeat by Liverpool before launching his tirade . The Leicester City boss then turns to a fan in the stands and begins to exchange words . Pearson appears to tell the supporter to 'f*** off and die' during the match . The Leicester boss continues his tirade against the supporter from the touchline . Pearson was targeted by a serial offender, who also picks on players and backroom staff. That is like waving a red flag at a bull as far as the manager is concerned. It was Pearson’s willingness to jump to their defence which resonated loudest in the dressing room. ‘The lads know that the gaffer is going to back us. He has always backed us,’ said midfielder Matty James. ‘We had a dip in form the first season I was here and he did the same then. He is a lot more scrutinised now in the Premier League, a lot more eyes and ears, but to see your gaffer backing you is a great thing to see. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson positions himself in the stands, where he is surrounded by supporters . ‘What has happened this week, that’s football and that’s what goes on. The gaffer has shown passion and the fans have shown passion but all of that has to be put to bed now.’ Thai owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who also found himself targeted for criticism by box holders on Tuesday night, is sticking with his manager too – although pressure is building. Leicester travel to Midlands rivals Aston Villa on Sunday, who are also struggling badly. Leicester took the lead through Leonardo Ulloa but that was as good as it got for the Foxes against Liverpool . Steven Gerrard (right) pumps the air after scoring the second goal in Liverpool's 3-1 victory over Leicester . Pearson retains the support of the majority of fans despite a dismal winless run of nine games since beating Manchester United 5-3. That match was also James’s Premier League bow, two years after rejecting a one-year deal with United to drop to the Championship. James, 23, chose to leave Old Trafford after a 14-month spell on the sidelines with a rare knee injury, which took time to diagnose. Leicester midfielder Matty James has backed Pearson over his heated exchange with a fan . He recalled: ‘There were times when I’d have an injection, take the edge off it and a couple of weeks later it would come back. I would go home in tears and it was scary. ‘I eventually had surgery and United offered me a one-year deal. Sir Alex Ferguson was brilliant and told me he didn’t want me to go. ‘It was surreal playing Manchester United in the Premier League as my first match. That win hasn’t got anything to do with this run. People say we got lackadaisical but I don’t think that at all. It has just been learning about this League.”","Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson exchanged angry words with fan .

"Liverpool are interested in Uruguay's latest striker prospect Jaime Baez. The 19-year-old plays for Juventud in the Uruguayan Primera Division and has scored four goals in 13 games this season.

Baez has been a regular with Uruguay Under 20s but does not have a dual passport so would struggle for a work permit at this stage.

"The family of a Sydney mother-of-two, who was charged with adultery in Lebanon, said pictures of her wedding to a man she had only known for two days proved she was a bigamist. Mahassen Issa, 29, said she travelled to Lebanon on June 20 when she met her boyfriend Mohammad Awick, after separating from her husband. Ms Issa was due to return to Sydney last weekend but said she was contacted by police and told she had been charged with adultery, which is a criminal offence in Lebanon and carried a six-month prison sentence. But one of Ms Issa's family members tells a different version of her troubles with the law, claiming she had in fact been charged with bigamy after she married Mr Awick in Lebanon three weeks ago. 'She’s disregarded her kids and disregarded her family, and gone off and married someone she had only known for 48 hours,' the family said. 'She didn’t tell us she was getting married. The photos we have were shared on Facebook.' Scroll down for video . A photo from Mahassen Issa's second wedding to Mohammad Awick which happened three weeks ago, her family claim . Mahassen Issa could face six months in a Lebanese jail for adultery after she went on holiday to Tripoli with her new boyfriend Mohammad Awick (left) Pictures given to Daily Mail Australia by the family member show Ms Issa in a beaded white dress and veil embracing Mr Awick in an intimate wedding portrait. Ms Issa's relative said the family had warned Ms Issa about marrying Mr Awick after her ex-husband registered their marriage in Lebanon. 'We tried to put a stop to it but she decided to proceed with her marriage in Lebanon...now it has backfired on her,' the relative told Daily Mail Australia. 'She's not going to jail because of adultery, she's going to jail because she got married while she was still married. 'That's illegal everywhere, not just in Lebanon. All she's doing is crying out for Australia to help her.' But Ms Issa protests her innocence, saying she and her estranged husband were in the middle of divorce proceedings in Australia. 'I came to Lebanon because I was going through a very messy divorce, I met my partner, we fell in love,' she told 9NEWS. 'I haven't broken any laws and I'm a victim of a jealous spouse's revenge plot.' Ms Issa says she been charged with adultery in Lebanon, but a family member claims these photos from her wedding day proved she was charged with bigamy . Ms Issa's first husband has only been named at Bassen and lives in Sydney's west with their two children . Ms Issa said she and her husband separated last September and that she and her new partner (pictured) have not done anything wrong . A relative of Ms Issa's husband told The Daily Telegraph that he was the one who informed Lebanese authorities on Ms Issa. Adultery is a crime in Lebanon, though with very different consequences for men and women. For a man to be convicted of adultery, he must commit the adulterous act in the marital home or the affair must be known about publicly. Whereas a woman can be convicted if she commits the act anywhere. A man can be found guilty if there is not enough material evidence of the affair, such as love letters. But a woman can be found guilty based on witness testimony. Men who are convicted of adultery face between one month and one year in prison, whereas women face between three months and two years in jail for the same crime. The female partner of an adulterer is subject to punishment regardless of her maritalstatus, whereas the male partner of an adulteress is not subject to any punishment unless he is also married. Finally, charges of adultery can be dropped against men who resume conjugal relations with their wives, but there is not the same provision for women. 'Women are still considered second and third grade citizen, they have a long way to go to achieve equality in the Middle East,' said Dr Eman Sharobeem, director of the Immigrant Women's Health Service. 'It’s a male-dominated environment where women struggle to make a stand for themselves and their family.'Ms Issa was informed by authorities that her passport had been flagged and she was not able to leave the country. He also said that the families of Ms Issa and her husband hoped she received a jail sentence and were 'very happy that she's getting charged and she's getting what she deserves'. Ms Issa's relatives have disowned her over the incident. 'The family has disowned her, we want nothing to do with her. She is a compulsive liar,' the family member told Daily Mail Australia. 'We told her not to get married three weeks ago, we told her she would get in trouble and look what happened.' Ms Issa who was born in Sydney and attended Wiley Park High School has two children, aged six and nine, and she said she fears not being able to return to them. 'The thought of not seeing my children again and my whole family disowning me, it's too much,' she said. The children are currently being cared for by their father in Sydney's west. Ms Issa says she separated from her husband in September last year, though her husband claims they did not separate until April 2014. Ms Issa said that she and Mr Awick have been receiving threats and she does not know who to turn to for assistance. 'The holiday that I thought would just be some time out has turned into a nightmare… we have done nothing wrong,' she told The Daily Telegraph. Ms Issa faced court today and has been assisted by the Australian Consulate General in Beirut and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 'The Australian Embassy in Beirut is providing consular assistance to an Australian woman who is seeking to depart Lebanon to return to Australia,' a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is important to bear in mind that Australians travelling overseas are subject to the laws of the countries they are in, just as citizens of other countries are subject to Australian laws when they are here.' Ms Issa said she and Mr Awick have received threats and are fearful of what their futures hold . Dr Eman Sharobeem, director of the Immigrant Women's Health Service, said that as long as other nations have laws that do not protect women, Australian citizens should not be subject to those laws. 'She's an Australian woman, our government should intervene to bring her back,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'Some nations allow girls to marriage at ages as young as six, would we consider these girls when they come to Australia as married? Are they victims of child abuse or child brides? 'So as long as we don't have clear vision on the law to protect women and to protect our citizens, the Australian government should intervene immediately. She should be returned to Australia and then Australian law should look into the situation,' said Dr Sharobeem.","In photos, Mahassen Issa is seen embracing Mohammad Awick in an intimate wedding portrait .

"Louis van Gaal may not want to rake over his difficult relationship with Ronald Koeman ahead of Manchester United’s game at Southampton on Monday night, but he’s only too happy to lavish praise on his former player Graziano Pelle and compare him to Robin van Persie. Van Gaal signed Pelle – who has taken the Premier League by storm with 10 goals already this season - as a raw 21-year-old for AZ Alkmaar in 2007. Two years later, the 6ft4ins Italian striker was part of the LVG’s team that shocked traditional superpowers Ajax, Feyenoord and PSV to win the Dutch title. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Graziano Pelle has had praised lavished upon him by Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal . 29-year-old Pelle in action for Southampton during their 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Wednesday night . Van Gaal (right) compared the Saints forward to his Manchester United striker Robin van Persie . Pelle joined Southampton for £9million in the summer and that already looks like a major bargain. Van Gaal knows if in-form United are to win their fifth game in a row, they’ll need to stop him. ‘I am not surprised by Pelle because I knew when I bought him at AZ, he was an attacking (focal) point for the team,’ said van Gaal. ‘I’ve said about Robin van Persie that I like strikers who are an attacking point, not only a striker who scores goals. Pelle also scores goals but Van Persie also scores goals. Attacking point is very important. ‘He is also very creative. He is always seeing the third man. Van Persie is also always seeing the third man. Those kind of strikers are the ones I like. It may be a surprise that he scored 10 goals – that is a lot – but he can do it. I knew that. ‘I bought him after he played for the (Italy) under-21s in the European Championships that were in the Netherlands. I visited the matches and saw him, and he came to AZ. ‘We had Shota Arveladze, one of the best strikers I have trained in my career, and he had to compete with him. I have trained a lot of strikers but he was one of the best and he had to compete with him which was not easy. But later on he came in the squad and showed his capacity. ‘Then Koeman bought him – because he was also manager of AZ – he took him with him to Feyenoord and he explodes. It is fantastic for him.’ Van Gaal will face off against Southampton boss Ronald Koeman on Monday night at St Mary's . Koeman was assistant coach to Van Gaal during his time as coach of Barcelona . It is the only time van Gaal voluntarily mentions Koeman. The pair have a notoriously frosty relationship dating back to their time at Ajax a decade ago when Koeman was manager and van Gaal technical director. Van Gaal insists he will shake Koeman’s hand before and after the game without any problem, but won’t have time to engage in social niceties after the match as he will be too busy, pointing out he didn’t have a chance to chat with Mark Hughes after Tuesday night’s win against Stoke City. Apart from that, any attempt to elicit words about his relationship with Koeman failed. ‘You don’t listen, it is private,’ glared the United boss. Van Gaal will be keen to keep United’s recent momentum going. Wayne Rooney will be back after a minor knee injury to skipper the side and van Persie is likely to be his partner with James Wilson and Falcao on the bench. The Colombian, whose loan period at Old Trafford has been dogged by injuries, can expect to be asked by van Gaal to play with the under-21 side at some stage to build his match sharpness. A top-four place remains United’s over-riding ambition this season. ‘We are going the right way,’ said van Gaal, who stopped short of guaranteeing fans Champions League football next season. James Wilson is set to return to the bench after starting in the 2-1 victory against Stoke in midweek . Radamel Falcao is also set to be on the bench again on Monday night as he continues his return from injury .","Louis van Gaal happy to lavish praise on his former player Graziano Pelle .

"Angry Everton manager Roberto Martinez claimed champions Manchester City should have had two men sent off by referee Andre Marriner in a feisty evening game at The Etihad Stadium. City defender Eliaquim Mangala left Samuel Eto'o with bad bruising on his back after a high and dangerous kung-fu style kick and later on Fernando's boot was even higher when he caught Gareth Barry on the forehead as they challenged for the ball soon after Yaya Toure had controversially given City a 24th-minute lead from the penalty spot. Martinez, who was also unhappy that Phil Jagielka had been penalised for a challenge on James Milner for the spot-kick, said: 'I don't like players being sent off but when you get a referee who gives a penalty to the letter of the law, Mangala is a red card every time. Everton manager Roberto Martinez shows his frustration on the sideline at the Etihad . 'The ball is clearly headed away by Eto'o, it is not 50-50, and Mangala's foot and knee are high in an unnatural position. It is violent conduct and Eto'o has a strong mark where he was kicked. 'Fernando is more unfortunate, he is challenging for the ball but it is a high boot. If he doesn't touch the head of Gareth Barry, it is a yellow card. But if he does touch it, which he did, it is a red.' Martinez was also critical of the penalty award which led to the only goal of the game. He said: 'To say I am disappointed is an understatement. The penalty should not have been allowed at all. Eliaquim Mangala left Samuel Eto'o with bad bruising on his back after a high and dangerous kung-fu style kick . 'There was clear contact, which is something that is allowed. It is a ball that is played into the 18-yard box, and the defender is allowed to challenge. 'Milner changes direction and Phil Jagielka carries on with his run, he can't disappear, so there is going to be a coming together. There was nothing below the waste, everything is hip and shoulder. 'Milner gets up immediately and fights for the ball which says it all. He was not even asking for a penalty. If it is a shoulder to shoulder, it is part of the game and shouldn't be penalised.' Fernando goes in with a high foot on Everton's Gareth Barry during the game at the Etihad . Martinez also complained the referee made his decision too hastily. 'I am more disappointed with the way it was given so quickly. It was an instant reaction and a very disappointing decision.' The Spaniard's frustrated was increased when he thought Frank Lampard made a similar challenge on Ross Barkley by the halfway line and wasn't punished. 'It's inconsistency,' he fumed. James Milner (right) goes down in the Everton penalty area after a challenge from Phil Jagielka . Everton are stuck in 11th place in the table, some way below expectations, but Martinez said: 'There wasn't very much between the two teams. When the penalty was given, our confidence left us. But I have never come to City before and they have had only three shots on target.' He has decided not to take his complaints about Mr Marriner's decisions any further – believing it would be a waste of time. 'When you are young and inexperienced, you want to fight the world and put it right,' he said. 'It is better for me to focus on my team and work on how they respond to bad decisions. You realise as you get older you will get good and bad decisions. So I really look forward to the second half of the season because it will be so easy to win games.'

"Ronnie O'Sullivan fought back off the ropes after fearing Stuart Bingham was about to deliver the knockout blow to his Coral UK Championship title bid. The four-time champion admitted any boxing referee would have stepped in to halt a similarly one-sided contest in the ring, after Bingham powered to a 4-1 lead in their semi-final at the York Barbican Centre. At a venue which has staged top-class fights before, playing host to local hero Henry Wharton and a young Joe Calzaghe in the mid-1990s, a 'greedy' O'Sullivan resurrected his trophy mission with some spectacular counter-punching, finishing with breaks of 117 and 94 to win 6-5 and set up a final clash with Judd Trump or Stephen Maguire. Ronnie O'Sullivan admits he got lucky in his semi-final win over Stuart Bingham at the UK Championship . O'Sullivan came back from 4-1 down to secure a 6-5 victory and passage into the final . Bingham had won just two of 11 previous matches against O'Sullivan, but curiously both those victories came in the UK Championship, at Telford in 2010 and in their quarter-final last year in York. The Basildon battler began the latest contest by rifling in breaks of 66, 49, 73 and a 137 total clearance, but thereafter O'Sullivan's game was transformed. In went breaks of 62, 68, and 67 before the 39-year-old Chigwell cueman saved the best for last. 'If it was a boxing match they would definitely have stopped it and you'd be talking to Stuart Bingham as the winner,' O'Sullivan said. 'In the first five frames he gave me a good hiding and I couldn't compete. If he'd kept playing like that it was 6-1 all day long, and I was lucky to get a frame. 'He outfoxed me, outpotted me and outscored me and looked so comfortable around the table. I got away with that one really. I got lucky.' O'Sullivan says he was 'outfoxed' and 'outpotted' by his opponent on Saturday . Bingham will feel as though he has missed a major opportunity to progress through to the final . Despite skipping several minor tournaments, O'Sullivan has a happy habit of challenging for the big trophies, and has never lost a UK Championship final, first winning the tournament as a 17-year-old in 1993. He is looking to cap a hugely successful 2014, in which he has landed titles at the Masters, Welsh Open, and Champion of Champions, as well as finishing runner-up to Mark Selby at the World Championship. O'Sullivan's ongoing success in York comes despite the ankle break he sustained on the eve of the tournament. With six wins already, plus a 147 break which stands to earn him £44,000, he is eyeing the £150,000 top prize on Sunday. 'If I play like I did in the last three or four frames, I'll be all right. But what we're talking about here is consistency. Consistency is the key,' O'Sullivan said. 'I'm being ultra critical here: I'm in the final of the UK Championship and I won the last tournament. But I've always been like that and it's difficult to paint a rosy picture because I want more, I'm greedy.' Bingham let thoughts of reaching the biggest final of his career enter his head, and it cost him. Asked what caused the turnaround, the 38-year-old said: ""I think it was when I thought about the final. I was thinking that it's not every day you get the chance to get to the UK final, and that was it. 'I didn't get a chance in the last frame. He took the bull by the horns.'","Ronnie O'Sullivan comes from 4-1 down to beat Stuart Bingham .

"Manuel Pellegrini has reminded Bayern of the importance of 'trust' as his Champions League hopes rest in Pep Guardiola's hands on Wednesday night. City need to win or earn a goalscoring draw away to Roma to progress to the Champions League knockout stages – the minimum requirement of Sheikh Mansour's ambitions for the club. But even that won't be enough if Bayern, who have already qualified as group winners, lose at home to CSKA Moscow. Manuel Pellegrini on the touchline during Manchester City's 1-0 win over Everton on Saturday . If Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich lose to CSKA Moscow, Manchester City will be out of the Champions League . In that case Moscow would finish ahead of City if they finish level on points because of their better head-to-head record. Although Bayern have a heavy injury list and crowded fixture programme, Pellegrini says he is not worried the Germans may see the value in fielding a weakened team that could knock City out of the competition early. 'I am not thinking about that. I think strong teams and big teams always try to win their games because it is important for the trust, important for the club,' said Pellegrini. 'Apart from winning in Rome, we must also now wait what happens about CSKA because if they win against Bayern, they will continue in the Champions League. 'So it doesn't depend on what we can do, but the only thing that we must do is to win. We must try to focus in our game.' To add to the intrigue, Bayern have been enthusiastic backers of Uefa's financial fair play regulations. City were heavily fined and forced to pick a reduced 21-man Champions League squad for this season for breaking FPP regulations in the past. There are various permutations that City will need to take into account on Wednesday. If they are drawing 1-1 or 2-2 in Rome, the scoreline of the other game in Munich would dictate if City needed to score a winning goal to progress. Guardiola on the touchline during his side's 3-2 defeat at the Etihad Stadium last month . It’s a minefield, although Manchester City can qualify with a victory or a high scoring draw in Rome unless CSKA Moscow win in Munich, in which case the Russians would go through. City would go out with a 0-0 draw and there are many more permutations beyond those. Even so, Pellegrini – criticised last season for not seeming to realise a 4-2 win against Bayern would help City top the group when he took off Sergio Aguero in the closing stages as City led 3-2 – insists he has not deployed anyone in particular to keep him abreast of developments in the other group game. 'I don’t think that it is complicated this year. I don't see where the complication is. We must win, we have nothing to think about,' he said. 'This team will not change. We will always be an offensive team, we will always try to go for the game from the beginning and we will do the same thing against Roma. 'We know if it is 0-0 that puts Roma in a better position than our team. If we draw 1-1 we are in a better position than Roma and both teams will depend on what happens with CSKA Moscow against Bayern. My mind is absolutely clear.' While Pellegrini waits to see if playmaker David Silva is fit enough for his first action since being injured in a Capital One Cup tie against Newcastle, he is also aware of the danger of Roma's 38-year-icon Francesco Totti. Totti embarrassed City's twitter feed at The Etihad Stadium by scoring Roma's goal in a 1-1 draw after they had highlighted before the game that he hadn't got a goal on English soil. Pellegrini, who was appointed after Roberto Mancini had failed to get City past the group stages in Europe, said Tottie remains a threat. 'He is the same as Frank Lampard,' said the City boss. 'They have enough quality – maybe not to play three games in a week – but when they play they are very good.' Pellegrini reached the Champions League quarter-finals with unfancied Malaga two seasons ago. Last year, City crashed out at the last-16 stage against Barcelona.","Manuel Pellegrini reminds Pep Guardiola of the importance of trust .

"Jimmy Tarbuck has been arrested over an alleged sexual assault on a young boy in the 1970s. The 73-year-old comedian was detained at his home in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London, and questioned for several hours. The arrest arises from allegations made to Scotland Yard officers working on Operation Yewtree, set up after Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory paedophile with more than 450 victims. Suspect: Jimmy Tarbuck, pictured with his wife Pauline last year, has been arrested following a complaint made to police . Police have arrested 12 men as part of . the operation, including convicted paedophile Gary Glitter, comics . Freddie Starr and Jim Davidson, presenter Rolf Harris and DJ Dave Lee . Travis.

The comedian, who became a . well-known TV personality . in the mid-60s, was arrested on April 26, but it had remained secret . because North Yorkshire Police chose not to release the information. It comes amid an ongoing row over the rise of secret arrests. It is common practice for police forces to release some details of high-profile arrests on the day they take place. In . the case of Stuart Hall, Lancashire Constabulary said that publicity . surrounding the initial arrest of the 83-year-old broadcaster led to the . majority of his sexual assault victims coming forward. In Tarbuck's case, the Met decided allegations against him did not fall under their Yewtree investigation and passed their information to North Yorkshire Police. Tarbuck, who became a well-known TV personality in the mid-60s, was arrested on April 26 . Entertainer: Jimmy Tarbuck (right) pictured with former England captain Bobby Moore and Ranjit Anand in 1978 . Last night Tarbuck said: 'I'm not commenting on this. You need to speak to my solicitor.' A police spokesman said: 'North Yorkshire Police can confirm that a 73-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a historic child sex abuse investigation in Harrogate. He was released on police bail pending further enquiries.' A week ago, following disclosure of the arrest of Rolf Harris, a Sunday newspaper reported that 'another household TV name' was under investigation. Tarbuck, who has been married to Pauline for more than 50 years, has three children, including 48-year-old actress and radio presenter Liza Tarbuck.

The comedian – known affectionately as Tarby – began his showbusiness career aged 18 as a member of a touring rock and roll show and then as a Redcoat for a Butlins holiday camp in Brighton. After leaving school at 15 his first jobs were as a mechanic and sweeping the floor of a ladies' hairdresser. He recalled: 'It was a brilliant way to meet girls.' Tarbuck was classmates with John Lennon at Dovedale Junior School in Liverpool. He claimed the former Beatle once spiked his drink with speed. The entertainer's first taste of mainstream success came in 1964, when he presented It's Tarbuck 65! on ITV. He went on to host numerous quiz shows, including Winner Takes All and Full Swing.

"Fevers were running high today for sports power couple Lindsay Vonn and Tiger Woods - but not for the same reasons. Vonn skied into a World Cup victory at Canada's Lake Louise in a triumphant comeback after 22 months of injury. It was not all smiles for the champion skier's boyfriend, however: a profusely-sweating Woods vomited twice on the golf course at Florida's Hero World Challenge where he remains in last place. He summed up the day in a tweet: 'I competed and Linds won'. Tale of two halves: Lindsay Vonn (left)  bagged her 15th career win at the Lake Louise World Cup today. Her boyfriend Tiger Woods (right) was not so spritely, vomiting twice and coming last in his Florida tournament . The pair recently endured lengthy spells in rehab for injuries which sidelined them from their respective sports for months - and Vonn credits Woods with inspiring her to push through the grueling physiotherapy. Vonn, 30, has been out of action since tearing her right knee ligament in a high-speed crash in early 2013 which forced her to miss the Sochi Winter Olympic Games. But she reclaimed her champion reputation on Saturday by leading the American team to an historic one-two-three finish at Lake Louise in Canada. 'I risked a lot more and I skied a lot better,' said Vonn. 'I am extremely happy to be on the top of the podium against and also with my two teammates. It couldn't be a better day.' Vonn, who is racing with a brace on her right knee, confessed she was disappointed with her performance in the season-opening slope on Friday, where she finished eighth. Under the weather: Woods, 38, vomited during practice and during play at the Hero's World Challenge . Record: Vonn, 30, screamed as she learned she had led the U.S. team to an historic one-two-three finish . Recovering: Woods, like Vonn, recently endured a lengthy spell in rehab for an injury that set him out of play . Celebrations: Lindsey Vonn, center, celebrates after winning the second women's downhill race with second place Stacey Cook, left, and third place Julia Mancuso, right, during the World Cup at Lake Louise, Canada . She said: 'I made the adjustment today. I tried to sit lower in my tuck and to be more aggressive in some turns. It paid off. I was just faster all the way down. 'Every day has gotten better here. I'm pushing the limits and I want more speed. I haven't had that yet until today.' Her ecstatic demeanor was a far cry from her 38-year-old boyfriend's appearance on the third day of play in Windermere, Florida. Woods has not played since August while he recovered from a back injury. In last place in the 18-player field, he coughed repeatedly into a towel and vomited along the third fairway, but carried on in his return to competition after an absence of some four months due to back pain. The 14-time major winner closed with three consecutive birdies to the delight of the large gallery following him at the layout that was his longtime home course. Working together: Vonn credits Woods with helping her to recover as they went through rehab together . 'I wasn't doing too good. But I thought I could hang in there,' Woods whispered to reporters after the round, explaining he had lost his voice. 'I wasn't in pain. I just was a little bit under the weather,' said Woods, who played on Friday after running a 102-degree fever. Today marked the 15th career win for Vonn in her event dubbed 'Lake Lindsey'. Vonn won her first race in Lake Louise in December 2004. She said her experience at the course helped her in conditions made difficult by poor light. 'There's been some changing terrain here over the last couple days,' she said. 'Every day is a little bit different. I tried to pay a little more attention to that because obviously you couldn't see it today. The light was really bad, but I know this course really well.'","Lindsay Vonn and Tiger Woods have both returned from injury this week .

"Tottenham and Liverpool are set to go head-to-head in the January transfer window as both clubs seeks to bolster their strike force for the second half of the season with Colombian Jackson Martinez at the top of both clubs wish lists. As revealed in Football Grapevine last month Porto have put several Premier League clubs on alert with the news that striker Martinez is up for grabs for a fee in the region of £30million. Although Liverpool insist Mario Balotelli will not be put on offer in January, the Reds are in the market for a new striker. Colombian striker Jackson Martinez is a target for both Liverpool and Tottenham . Martinez could be available for £30m if he were to leave Porto . Martinez is one under consideration, as is West Brom’s Saido Berahino, whom the Baggies will try and get £25 million-plus for. Likewise Martinez and Berahino are on Tottenham’s radar. West Bromwich Albion's Saido Berahino is also a target for both Liverpool and Spurs . Tottenham could use striker Roberto Soldado as part of the deal to sign a striker in January . Spurs may be able to do a deal with Porto whereby they only pay £20million in a deal that sees Roberto Saldado go the other way, although part exchange deals are always hard to finalise especially mid-season. That said Liverpool, despite saying he will stay, could try and do a deal with Napoli which would see Balotelli return to Italy and the Reds sign £30million rated striker Gonzalo Higuain. Real Madrid have targeted their next ‘Galactico’ signing, Germany’s Marco Reus. That is likely to scupper Manchester United’s hopes of luring the Borussia Dortmund midfielder to Old Trafford in January. Our Madrid source told the Football Grapevine: ‘There is talk of Manchester United wanting Reus and for sure he will leave Dortmund. Bayern Munich want him too… but he is the player Madrid want next summer, or even in January. And the club is confident of getting him. They normally do get their target’ Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus is a target for Real Madrid . German international Reus is wanted by a number of top clubs in Europe but Real Madrid seem to lead the way . The proposed arrival of Reus at Madrid though confirms the departure of fellow German Sami Khedira. We are told that could then mean United making a move for Khedira, who has long been a target for both Arsenal and Chelsea. If Real Madrid do sign Reus then it could mean Sami Khedira is sold to Manchester United . United also believe they will be able to outbid Arsenal in the pursuit of another Dortmund player - centre half Mats Hummels. Cheick Tiote could yet secure a move from Newcastle to Liverpool in January despite hysterical red top front page headlines with regard to an alleged driving offence. Newcastle's Cheick Tiote could move to Liverpool in January . Jan Vertonghen is set to quit Tottenham in January. Liverpool could move in for the Belgium international who can play as a centre half or at left back. Jan Vertonghen could be heading for the exit door at Spurs in January and could head to Liverpool . West Brom are poised to make a move for West Ham’s out of favour midfielder Matt Jarvis. Jarvis has failed to settle at the Hammers since his £10.75m from Wolves in 2012. But the Baggies would not want to pay more than £5m for the player. West Ham's Matt Jarvis could be a target for West Bromwhich Albion . Arsenal are ready to send Joel Campbell out on loan in January. There will be plenty of interest in the Costa Rica forward, with Southampton being one possible destination. Joel Campbell could be sent out on loan by Arsenal with Southampton one of the possible destinations . I AM HEARING: . While Sir Alex Ferguson will maintain his public support for Manchester United and genuinely rates Louis van Gaal as a coach, I hear that the former Old Trafford boss is rather bemused at the club suddenly adopting a spendthrift approach in the transfer market. He is wondering whether over a quarter of centuries worth of canny work under him that made the club the commercial giant it has become could be undermined as a consequence of seeking quick fix and expensive solutions. Sir Alex Ferguson is said to be bemused by Manchester United's high spending in the transfer window . I AM ALSO HEARING: . Steve Gerrard is torn between spending the next two years at Liverpool or ending his playing career with a completely new experience. Gerrard has told his Anfield bosses that he won’t be rushed into signing the new two-year contract on much reduced terms which he was offered last week. Steven Gerrard is considering his options before deciding where to end his career . Several MLS clubs are interested in Gerrard as are NASL club New York Cosmos. And former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez would be interested in taking Gerrard to Napoli. And another Italian club, Inter Milan, are also interested. Gerrard is free to talk to overseas clubs and agree a pre-contract next month. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has suggested he is set to spend £20 million in January. But if the Gunners lose out to Manchester United in the race for Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels then they will have to pay £37 million for Sporting Lisbon’s William Carvalho. Last week though, Wenger confirmed another Football Grapevine exclusive that the Gunners are set to offer £8m for Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings. Dortmund defender Mats Hummels is a target for Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger . David Moyes is set raid former club Manchester United to bolster the squad of new club Real Sociedad. Juan Mata is a target for Seville and may be too expensive, but Moyes could try and sign him on a loan deal. Rafael, Phil Jones and Ashley Young are also under consideration. David Moyes could try and convince Juan Mata to join him at Real Sociedad on loan . Paul Scholes believes German midfielder and World Cup winner Bastian Schweinsteiger rather than Cristiano Ronaldo should be named world player of the year. But it is German keeper Manuel Neuer who is three man short list along with red hot favourite Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Scholes says: ‘All the Ballon d’Or nominees are wonderful footballers, but it’s hard to accept there is no German footballer beyond Neuer is there. Thomas Muller, Toni Kroos and Schweinsteiger were all excellent in Germany’s World Cup win, my player of the year is Schweinsteiger.’ Ronaldo is still 1-5 on, but Neuer could get the nod …he is 9-2 … Messi is 10-1. BTW: . Louis van Gaal embarrassed himself by ranting during his press conference over speculation that Manchester United could spend a further £200m on new players. The Dutchman called it ‘disgusting’. The United boss complained that naming names - a long list well known to readers of this column – and the sums of money involved, hindered United. He even complained that clubs like United and Real Madrid were compromised by having to pay bigger fees for players compared to clubs like Southampton and Aston Villa and he blamed ‘press speculation’ for this. In that respect Van Gaal is either ‘deluded’, ‘disrespectful’, or even ‘disgusting’. The truth is, United play on their big name and big resources to attract big names. Part of that process is to leak names and numbers to lure the players. It’s part of the process. A process which could actually be argued is ‘disgusting’. Oh, and just to add, as a consequence of all that, Van Gaal gets paid a lot more at United than he would at either Southampton or Villa. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal was not happy to talk about transfers at his press conference . I Say: . I have a lot of sympathy with Nigel Pearson for lashing back at a lynch mob of Leicester fans. Criticism and valid opinion is one thing, but vile vitriol is quite another. After all in, the wake of a revitalised Newcastle’s 2-1 win over top of the table Chelsea what are the sinister elements of Pardew Out brigade on the Tyne saying now?

"Mario Balotelli will be given a final chance by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers despite growing disenchantment within the club over the Italian’s form and off-the-field difficulties. Balotelli is currently out of action with a groin injury and faces a ban of up to five matches after being charged for posting a ‘racist and anti-Semitic’ message on social media. He's only managed to score twice since joining Liverpool from AC Milan for £16million at the end of the last transfer window, and  has attracted controversy wherever he has played. He was once described by Jose Mourinho as ‘unmanageable’. VIDEO Scroll down to see Rodgers speak out on Balotelli's recent controversy . Mario Balotelli has failed to live up to expectations since arriving at Anfield for £16m this summer . Manager Brendan Rodgers has backed his decision to take a gamble on the Italian firebrand . Lacking in firepower, Liverpool were held to a goalless draw against Sunderland on Saturday . However, Liverpool are not actively looking to sell the player in January, believing the summer is a more realistic time to make a decision if the situation has not improved. With Daniel Sturridge out injured until the new year, Rodgers has admitted his options up front are thin, with 32-year-old Rickie Lambert and Sunderland target Fabio Borini his only other senior strikers. Rodgers has defended the decision to buy Balotelli, saying it was done out of necessity and with the backing of owner John W Henry and chief executive Ian Ayre. Balotelli faces a five-game ban after being charged with posting a 'racist and anti-Semitic' Instagram message . The 24-year-old is yet to find the back of the net in the Premier League this season . Veteran striker Rickie Lambert (centre) is one of the few options Liverpool have to lead the line . Rodgers said: ‘Daniel Sturridge has shown in his career so far that he gets injuries. So, to go with no one would have been very difficult for us. ‘It would be unfair to leave Rickie Lambert maybe as a 32-year-old as the only striker we had. I felt this was a risk we needed to take with Mario because as a group we couldn’t afford not to at the time. It was late on and we needed to have someone in. It’s something that we can’t regret.’ Balotelli, 24, will strongly defend the FA charge, insisting the post on Instagram that included the comment ‘jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew’ was an attack on racial stereotypes. Balotelli’s mother is Jewish and he also suffered regular racist abuse when playing in Italy.","Brendan Rodgers has backed his decision to sign Mario Balotelli .

That brought a beaming smile from her, but it was not easy going for Woods on a hot, sunny day at the exclusive enclave. Woods, in the midst of another swing change, stumbled again with his chipping, which cost him numerous strokes in the first two rounds. From the rough a few yards off the left side of the green at the par-four sixth, Woods chunked his chip, moving the ball only about a foot and ended up with a bogey. He showed more yips on his chips on the back nine before mounting his explosive finish. Woods was asked if he could take away any positives from the difficult day. 'Not bad.

"A Brazilian Michael Jackson superfan used acid to lighten his skin and spent about £2,000 on a series of cosmetic procedures to look like his hero. Antonio Gleidson Rodrigues, 32, the self-proclaimed number one Michael Jackson impersonator in Brazil, has had rhinoplasty in order to imitate the King Of Pop and spends around four hours each day rehearsing his dance moves. Gleidson Jackson, as he likes to be known, had his first operation five years ago when he had his nasal septum corrected to allow him to reach higher notes when singing. Antonio Gleidson Rodrigues, the self-proclaimed number one Michael Jackson impersonator in Brazil, has used acid to lighten his skin and spent £2,000 to look like his hero. He is pictured, right, without his make-up in 2009 . He said: 'I wasn't able to reach notes like Michael before but after surgery I can now sing some notes in falsetto.' Following his first bid at surgery, Gliedson, of Fortalenza, continued in his mission to imitate the world famous pop star by having hyaluronic acid injected into his face, which had a whitening effect, and botox injections to enhance the area under his eyes. The former drama teacher also had surgery to close the gaps in his teeth and his eyebrows tattooed. Gliedson is now hoping to raise enough money by imitating Jackson to have even more surgery. He said: 'If I can afford it in the future, I am thinking of working on my cheekbones so I can get rid of the wrinkles along my mouth - I also want to have my eyebrows arched. 'I would like to have my forehead tattooed and have my nose made even slimmer.' Gleidson Jackson, as he likes to be known, spends about one and a half hours applying make up before showtime . The impersonator also spends around four hours each day rehearsing his dance moves . He was encouraged to become a Michael Jackson impersonator when he was just 19 after his drama students suggested he looked like the pop star. He said: 'It was tough, they teased me for around 15 days and the mothers of the children even got involved. 'By the end of it I was caught up - I had the bug.' Gleidson now says his act and the dedication he has put into improving it is the greatest tribute he can pay to his idol. He said: 'In my concerts I always say that no copy will ever be as good as the original. 'But I can always say that I will always try my best to achieve perfection - just like Michael.'

The former drama teacher now says his act and the dedication he has put into improving it is the greatest tribute he can pay to his idol . His aunt Maria Doriane Bastos de Souza, however, worries about the  impersonator. She said: 'He is obsessed, sometimes he will spend hours on the internet looking for things related to Michael Jackson. 'I worry for his health - I want him to come downstairs and eat a sandwich. 'I also worry when he goes into surgery, I never want him to feel disappointed and sometimes surgery doesn't work out the way you would want it to.' Jackson's death in June 2009 rocked the world but there were few who felt it quite as much as Gleidson. Gleidson's aunt Maria Doriane Bastos de Souza, worries about the impersonator, saying he is 'obsessed'. Gleidson is pictured, right, with his mother in June this year . He said: 'My reaction was absurd - I started to cry right away, I still don't understand how this could have happened to Michael Jackson. 'He was a guy who used to drink juice and avoid energy drinks - how could he have died of an overdose. 'In my opinion, to lose that man - the greatest artist of all times - is a real tragedy for the world.

"Arsenal looks like being the next club on 15-year-old child star Martin Odegaard’s tour of England, with the schoolboy, who has already played for the Norwegian national side, auditioning major clubs before he makes a decision as to whom to join. Manchester City, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are also on the trail of the teenager, who spent last week training at Liverpool and looks likely to make a decision based on where he has the most chance of developing and making the first team quickly. Odegaard will be guided in negotiations by his father, Hans Erik, who was a professional footballer in the Norwegian league and who is now the assistant manager at Norwegian club, Mjondalen. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Odegaard in goal-scoring action . Arsenal are next in line to have a look at Norwegian youngster Martin Odegaard . Odegaard junior made his international debut for Norway against the United Arab Emirates in August and then became the youngest player ever to feature in a European Championship qualifier, when he came on Norway against Bulgaria in October aged 15 years, 253 days. In the Norwegian close season he is currently negotiating with all the major clubs in Europe and is expected to spend time training at most of them before making a decision, with all the Premier League clubs still hopeful he can be persuaded to join them. United and Arsenal however will emphasise Louis van Gaal and Arsene Wenger’s willingness to blood teenagers in the first eleven, which would give them an advantage. Brendan Rodgers can point to Raheem Sterling’s development as an example as to how Odegaard might develop at Liverpool. Most observers consider him the most talented teenage player seen for years.

"Food fan: Mexican drug cartel boss Joaquin 'El CHapo' Guzman, pictured at his February arrest, loved gourmet food and would creep down from his mountain hide out to indulge at elegant restaurants - and pick up the check for the entire establishment in exchange for their silence . A longtime Mexican drug cartel boss loved gourmet food and would creep down from his mountain hide out to indulge at elegant restaurants - and pick up the check for the entire establishment in exchange for their silence. Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán even managed to buy off prison staff enough to enjoy decadant food while behind bars, throwing  parties for his favored inmates that featured alcohol, lobster bisque, and filet mignon. The now-captured kingpin also had an insatiable need to pay for sex, according to a fascinating new profile in the New Yorker, despite having a young beauty queen wife. He would eat Viagra 'like candy' and go visit prostitutes, even having crooked guards bring hookers to his prison cell. Guzmán was captured at a beach resort in February, just days after he escaped the clutches of police by fleeing through an elaborate series of tunnels near his Culiacan home. An unnamed D.E.A. official revealed to the New Yorker that Guzman's love of gourmet food was one of his downfalls, and from time to time he indulged his penchant at restaurants in Sinaloa or in a neighboring state. It was always the same procedure - diners would be startled by a team of gunmen, who would politely demand their cell phones. Guzman and his entourage would then come in and feast on shrimp and steak. When done, they would thank the other diners for their playing along, return their cell phones and pick up the tab for everyone before fleeing. But Guzmán had other weaknesses. Law enforcement confirmed that Guzmán, had been married at least three times, had traveled in February to Los Cabos for a liaison with a prostitute. Caught: Guzmán, pictured, even managed to buy off prison staff enough to enjoy decadant food while behind bars, throwing  parties for his favored inmates that featured alcohol, lobster bisque, and filet mignon . Prostitutes: The now-captured kingpin, pictured, also had an insatiable need to pay for sex, according to a fascinating new profile in the New Yorker, despite having a young beauty queen wife . Numerous current and former officials told the New Yorker that Guzmán consumed a vast number of Viagra pills. 'He ate it like candy,' one told the magazine. D.E.A. agents who monitored his e-mails and texts were amazed that his communications were less about his multimillion dollar drug business but juggling his many women. 'It was a non-stop deal,' a former law-enforcement official who kept track of the communications told the New Yorker. Even when he was behind bars, he upheld his prominent reputation as a boss and bought off prison staff to enjoyed a life of relative luxury. According to the New Yorker, he conducted business by cell phone, orchestrated regular visits from prostitutes, and ate fillet steak while other prisoners ate gruel. In March, a Mexican judge denied Guzman an injunction against any extradition to the United States. The Federal Judicial Council said in a statement that the judge rejected Guzman's petition because the U.S. government hadn't filed an extradition request. If the U.S. does file a request, Guzman will be free to go back to court to seek an injunction. Guzman faces organized crime and drug trafficking charges in five different Mexican federal courts. The Mexican government has said he will not be extradited soon to the U.S., where he has been indicted in several states. Guzman was arrested after 13 years as a fugitive since escaping from prison. He is being held in Mexico's highest-security prison. Tunnels: These pictures show elaborate sewer shaft the Mexican drug lord used to evade police just days before he was ultimately captured . Escape route: As Mexican marines forced their way into his main hideout in Culiacan, Guzman slipped out of through a secret door beneath a bathtub and into this tunnel . Planned: He climbed down a corrugated steel ladder into a network of tunnels and sewer canals that connect to at least seven other houses in Culiacan, officials said . The powerful drug cartel leader employed high-tech communications gadgetry and sophisticated counterespionage practices to elude an international manhunt, The Associated Press learned. In the end, however, life on the run unraveled for Guzman in a decidedly low-tech way. A traditional wiretap in southern Arizona pointed authorities to a cellphone being used by a top associate. Within a day, Guzman was captured in a high-rise beachfront condominium in Mazatlan, Mexico. Guzman's penchant for technology and his efforts to stay ahead of the law were described to the AP by a senior law enforcement official with direct knowledge of Guzman's years on the run and by a U.S. government official who was briefed on the case. Both spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the situation by name. 'He didn't spare any expenses when it came to protecting himself,' the law enforcement official said.Some of the communications equipment Guzman used was not generally available to consumers. The sophistication of the gear and Guzman's diligence deeply impressed investigators who were pursuing him. Among other practices, Guzman employed countersurveillance scanners to detect transmitters hidden in rooms or carried by people with whom he was meeting. 'It was top-notch,' the law enforcement official said. Because Guzman was so well protected, he managed to attend family events and marry a local beauty queen in a well-attended bash in his home state of Sinaloa, all while keeping his multinational, billion-dollar drug empire thriving. U.S. and Mexican officials spent years hunting for a weak spot in his network. The U.S. government official said the Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement used traditional wiretaps to zero in on Guzman. At times in the last year, agents were able to intercept BlackBerry messages and other communications. Measurements: Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman is pictured in February in a combo of photographs released by Mexico's Attorney General Office with identification mapping marks made by the source to point out similarities in face measurements . Identity: Guzman, during the scientific tests to prove his identity on February 26. The Sinaloa Cartel leader was subjected to a buccal swab, a phisiognomic identity study and a test of 10 fingerprints . Earlier in February, authorities raided one of Guzman's suspected hideouts in Culiacan, the capital city of Sinaloa, where Guzman operated with near impunity. Inside, they found a cellphone belonging to his communications chief, which helped lead to a trusted courier, the government official said. The courier later described for authorities a series of houses Guzman used as hideouts. At least one other arrest pointed Guzman's pursuers to the Pacific Coast city of Mazatlan. The most important clue came from an ICE wiretap monitored in Nogales, Ariz. That information directed Mexican marines to the exact condominium where Guzman had been hiding since outrunning troops days earlier through interconnected tunnels beneath his Culiacan hideouts. The officials would not discuss the specific methods used over the last 13 years. The law enforcement official said Guzman wasn't holed up in the rugged mountains of western Mexico while on the run. With the help of his own trusted security force and the likely assistance of some Mexican authorities, Guzman had moved freely about parts of Mexico and even internationally. 'He moved for the most part with impunity (in Culiacan),' the official said. 'He traveled at will. He had private planes. He was a businessman and he would go and meet people to discuss not just the drug trade. He was obviously interested in the money trade, the markets. He was looking at expanding the empire.' By the time of his capture, Guzman's empire stretched from Canada through Latin America, Europe, parts of Asia and Australia. He is believed to have amassed a fortune worth billions. U.S. and Mexican authorities were close to nabbing Guzman in the past but arrived at resorts or other locations hours or days too late, the law enforcement official said. They were never closer than in February. Guzman's pursuers were on his heels during raids at the stash houses in Culiacan. The law enforcement official said Guzman was believed to be just ahead of Mexican troops when he vanished in the underground network below the houses before absconding to the high-rise condo in Mazatlan, along the coast.","Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán loved gourmet food .

"One balmy evening in Cape Town, in the summer of 2010, a television camera followed Wayne Rooney from a football pitch. England had just stumbled through a sterile draw with Algeria and their World Cup progress was under threat. The England followers started to protest at the abject display and suddenly Rooney became aware of their jeers. Briefly, he paused to sneer at the camera: ‘Nice to see your own fans booing you,’ he said. ‘That’s what loyal support is.’ The remark was caught by a pitch-side microphone and the subsequent outcry led the television news. Wayne Rooney has matured into a leader as captain for Manchester United (season) and England this season . At the 2010 World Cup, Rooney (centre) was attacked for condemning England fans after a 0-0 draw vs Algeria . The team’s performance had been truly inept. High in the grandstand of the Cape Town Stadium, I tried to recall a more abject English result. ‘1066?’ offered a helpful neighbour. But somehow, Rooney’s reaction had made a wretched situation far worse. He seemed to be suggesting that the fans had no right to criticise England’s miserable display. Their function was to applaud, to approve, to spend their money and to offer ‘loyal support’. Anything less smacked of treachery. For the rest of their ill-starred tournament - i.e. two more matches - England players were pilloried for a whole range of perceived offences, from arrogant entitlement to lofty indifference to undeserved affluence. The cliched cry of ‘pampered prima donnas’ rang out across the land. And the kid from Croxteth, whose shoulders had carried England’s highest hopes, was no longer an idol, but a target. In the words of England’s manager Fabio Capello: ‘At the moment, Rooney isn’t Rooney.’ Rooney (left) was one of many England players to have an uninspiring match against Algeria four years ago . After being booed off by England fans, Rooney suggested they had no right to criticise their performance . Monday evening at Southampton, Rooney will lead out a Manchester United side who seek to impose pressure on Chelsea and Manchester City at the summit of the Premier League. Most of his colleagues have been acquired at huge expense from around the world, yet Rooney remains the soul and the spirit of his team. He works harder, covers more ground, expends more energy and scores more goals than the rest. And he has embraced the responsibility of captaincy; pleading, scolding, encouraging team-mates by effort and example. As with United, so with England. From time to time, there have been tentative calls for Rooney to be ‘rested’. Capello came under heavy pressure to bite the bullet and so, at times, has Roy Hodgson. Both resisted and both were right to stand by their judgment. True, Rooney did not always appear to justify their faith. There were days when the ball would bounce off his shins, when his intensity seemed reduced and the play seemed to be happening around him. Rooney has been passed fit to play against Southampton on Monday after recovering from a knee injury . Many of us believed his physique would eventually betray him, that his heavy body would impair both endurance and acceleration, and the subsequent frustration would truncate his career. He has taken pleasure in proving us wrong. In truth, Rooney will never be the player we dreamed he might become when Everton put him in their first team at 16 years old, or when England capped him a year later. Those were the days when starry-eyed comparisons were made with Paul Gascoigne, another free spirit and perhaps the English game’s purest talent since Tom Finney. Gascoigne was the pitiful victim of alcoholism and of the cynical exploitation of those who should have protected him. Rooney was never blessed with Gascoigne’s instinctive genius, but his foundations were firmer, he was fortunate in having a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson to steer him through the critical stages of his career and, in Coleen, married a woman who shares his background and appreciates his pressures. He gave a fascinating interview on the occasion of his 100th cap, when he spoke of the problem of trying to prolong his England career into his thirties while still spending time with Coleen and his sons. Rooney (left) has had the weight of the nation's shoulders on him since he made his Everton debut at 16 . ‘I actually spoke to my wife about it,’ recalled Rooney. ‘I said it’s mad how all the players are retiring. When you get to a certain age, you almost feel like you have to do it to extend your club career. She was very good. She was the one who said to me, “It’s a short career, you have plenty of time to have your time off with us as a family when you finish playing. You’ll regret it if you do.” ‘I thought, “Yes, I would. Football is what I love doing. Playing for my country I love, I’d regret it. I don’t think I would ever walk away”.’ It was the measured response of one who had given his situation some thought. And here, perhaps, we see the essential change in Rooney. At 29, he has achieved a pleasing measure of maturity. We see it both in his play and in his answers to questions. He gives them earnest thought, considers the options and arrives at a serious conclusion. The trite, all-purpose cliches supplied by media advisers have been jettisoned. Instead, we sense we are listening to a man who has discovered his own mind. Rooney (centre) scored twice in England 3-1 friendly win at Scotland in November at Celtic Park . He will never completely abandon the old instincts. No matter how many more goals he may score or caps he may win, he will always be just a single calamitous tackle away from uproar. But Wayne Rooney has achieved something remarkable; he has grown up, while remaining the best kid in the playground. Those of us who recall that sad evening in Cape Town will rejoice in the transformation. The 29-year-old (centre) was also on target in United's 3-0 home win against Hull in the league on November 29 . Sam Hammam, former owner of Wimbledon FC, claims a new BT Sport documentary shamefully misrepresents his old club. The film paints an ugly picture of fights, physical intimidation, bullying and loutishness. ‘The programme portrayed the group as violent thugs, as if that was all they had to them,’ he says. Not having seen it, I cannot usefully comment. But I did witness some of the repellent excesses of Wimbledon’s ‘Crazy Gang’ in the 80s and 90s. And I suspect the programme makers have done a pretty accurate job.","Wayne Rooney condemned England fans for their support during their 2010 World Cup clash against Algeria .

"An undated handout of Galindo 'El Mellado' or 'Z-9' Mellado Cruz, thought to have died in a gun battle with Mexican army troops . One of the founding members of Mexico's notorious Zetas drug cartel is believed to have been killed in a shootout with government troops, it was revealed today. Galindo 'El Mellado' or 'Z-9' Mellado . Cruz is thought to have died in a hail of gunfire during a raid . at his hideout in the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas. Mellado was an original member of Los Zetas, a group of paramilitary deserters that grew into one of Mexico's largest and most feared drug cartels. It emerged as a group of enforcers for the Gulf cartel, but the two groups then split in 2010 and became bitter rivals. Mellado sided with the Gulf Cartel. So far, officials in Tamaulipas have not publicly confirmed Mellado's apparent death in the Las Fuentes neighborhood of Reynosa. But a U.S. law enforcement official and Tamaulipas law enforcement official, both not authorized to speak publicly, said they have received information that points to the slaying of the former Zeta. Mellado had been a key target of U.S. law enforcement agencies in recent years for his role as a leading figure within the Gulf Cartel, the U.S. official said. On Friday evening, the Tamaulipas government issued a news release briefly describing a firefight where a gunman and a Mexican soldier died, confirming the deaths of four other gunmen in another firefight. The news release doesn't identify those killed, one of whom is believed to be Galindo, the Tamaulipas official said. Mexican soldiers 'had gone out to get him, but his people put up a fight and things got bad very, very quickly,' the official said in Spanish. While Galindo and his men fought with authorities, Gulf Cartel gunmen set off a series of blockades and threw road spikes throughout the city's main avenues in order to slow down military reinforcements, he said. Suspected gang members are rounded up in Monterrey, Mexico . In March, Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, the leader . of the Knights Templar Cartel,was killed in a shootout in western Mexico. He . led the La Familia cartel when he supposedly perished in a two-day . gunbattle with federal police in December 2010 in Michoacan, his home . state. No corpse was found then, however. Last July, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, 40, head of the Zetas Cartel, was . intercepted with two lieutenants in a pick-up truck near Nuevo Laredo. Mexican officials said he had eight guns and $2m (£1.3m) in cash. Trevino Morales, infamous for his brutality, was wanted on . both sides of the border for ordering massacres and running drugs on a . global scale. He took control of the Zetas following the death of group founder Heriberto Lazcano in October 2012. He was known was known as 'Zeta-40'. It . followed the death in October 2012 of Heriberto Lazcano, the previous . leader of Los Zetas, who was killed in a shoot-out with the Mexican . marines. Longtime Mexican drug cartel boss Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzmán was captured at a beach resort in February, just days after he escaped the clutches of police by fleeing through an elaborate series of tunnels near his Culiacan home. In March, a Mexican judge denied Guzman an injunction against any extradition to the United States. Guzman faces organised crime and drug trafficking charges in five different Mexican federal courts. Guzman was arrested after 13 years as a fugitive since escaping from prison. He is being held in Mexico's highest-security prison. Tamaulipas became one of the arenas for . fighting between the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas and was one of Mexico's . most violent states. But the state had calmed somewhat by 2012, before . violence re-ignited in recent weeks. The only known photograph of Mellado comes from his days in the Mexican army, showing a young man with thick eyebrows, large cheeks and slicked back hair, wearing a white shirt and black coat. Other than the small black-and-white photograph, little was known about Mellado's current appearance. According to information released by the Mexican army, Mellado signed up for military service September 1, 1992 and requested his discharge May 1, 1999, which was granted. The U.S. official said after leaving the military, Mellado joined the Gulf Cartel as one of the first members of a new enforcement wing that would evolve into the Zetas. Originally made up of former military and federal police, the Zetas earned a name for their fighting skill and their ruthlessness, carrying out various executions in Mexico and South Texas. In early 2010, the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas split up, setting off a bloody war that has lasted for more than four years. According to the U.S. law enforcement official, during that split, Mellado Cruz sided with the Gulf Cartel managed to avoid public attention. Still, he has been a key figure in controlling the area just south of Starr County, commonly known as La Ribereña. Reynosa in recent days has seen the return of regular firefights between warring factions from the Gulf Cartel, who are vying for control of the city. Tamaulipas government figures show the recent firefights in Reynosa have claimed 23 lives, including two uninvolved civilians, two federal police officers, one soldier and 18 gunmen. As a result of the perceived lack of security in Reynosa due to the constant firefights, on Saturday — which is Mother's Day in Mexico — the border city's residents took to social media to voice their discontent by sending out expletive-laden messages to the accounts of Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Tamaulipas Governor Egidio Torre Cantu. The messages blamed the government officials for the widespread violence in Tamaulipas.","Galindo 'El Mellado' or 'Z-9' Mellado .

"Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he would make 'no apologies for putting sex offender where they deserve to be' The number of sex attackers behind bars has doubled in only a decade – with eight jails now containing no other type of inmate. The huge increase has in part been fuelled by convictions in historic abuse cases. In recent months, high-profile figures – including Stuart Hall, Max Clifford and Rolf Harris – have been imprisoned for crimes dating back decades. Prison officials have had to set up a string of new programmes to cope with the explosion in the sex offender population – which now stands at 11,150. It is the equivalent of one in every eight inmates and has leapt by 650 in the past year alone. A total of eight jails have been converted or opened that are exclusively for paedophiles, rapists and other sex offenders. Officials said holding sex offenders together makes them more likely to engage in treatment programmes. These include the use of ‘anti-libidinal’ drug treatments used to lessen prisoners’ sexual urges. A pilot project using the drugs is to be rolled out across prisons after proving successful at HMP Whatton near Nottingham, ministers will announce today. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘As a Government we make no apologies for putting sex offenders where they deserve to be – in jail. ‘But when they are there it is important that we deal with their offending behaviour – that means programmes consistent with the best evidence, targeted at those who pose the greatest threat. ‘I don’t want a one-size-fits-all approach which costs the taxpayer lots of money and doesn’t reduce the risk posed by the most serious offenders.’ However, to cope with the huge increase of inmates, special treatment programmes are no longer being targeted at low-risk offenders. The move is likely to spark concern among penal reform groups about a lack of resources inside Britain’s packed jails. Stuart Hall, Max Clifford and Rolf Harris are among figures to be jailed in recent months for historic sex abuse allegations, and such offenders now make up one in eight prisoners . But officials last night insisted that international evidence showed it would be more effective to focus on more prolific offenders, who will pose a greater risk to the public on release. The Ministry of Justice says investment in all offending behaviour programmes – including sex offender treatment, drug treatment and domestic violence programmes – has increased by £280,000 in the past 12 months in prison and by £1.4million for those delivered in the community. There has been a huge increase in investigations into historic allegations of sexual assault since the full scale of Jimmy Savile’s crimes came to light following the former DJ’s death in October 2011. Operation Yewtree was launched to investigate his crimes but was widened to include other alleged offenders and by October 2012 police reported that more than 400 lines of inquiry had been assessed. A number of other former celebrities remain on bail or are awaiting trial for sexual offences. As well as the increase in historic cases, another factor behind the surging population of sex offenders is tougher sentencing. The average length of sentence for those convicted of sexual offences has gone up from 40 months in 2003 to more than 59 months in 2013 . Alongside Whatton, the prisons wholly dealing with sex offenders are Albany, Isle of Wight; Usk, South Wales; Bure, near Norwich; Ashfield, near Bristol; Stafford; Rye Hill, near Rugby; and Littlehey, Cambridgeshire.","There are 11,150 sex offenders in UK jails, equivalent to one in eight inmates .

"Experience has made a wise old bird out of Mark Ramprakash – and he plans to take his charges under his wing in his new role as England’s batting coach. To those who fear for Alastair Cook and Co being tutored by a man whose introspective tendencies contributed to a scandalously below-par Test batting average of 27, Ramprakash himself has an honest riposte: ‘If I’d known then what I know now, it would have been great.’ Eight years after being ditched for good by the selectors following a tricky tour of New Zealand in early 2002, Ramprakash was still churning out the hundreds for Surrey. The elegant cover-drive remained intact. But he had learned a thing or two about mental strength. Ramprakash in his part-time role as England batting coach during the India Test series last summer . The 45-year-old chats to Scott Borthwick during a session at Loughborough in 2012 . Now, named as Graham Gooch’s successor until next September, he has the chance to pass it on: here, the ECB are hoping, beginneth the lesson. Ramprakash offers England captain Alastair Cook advice during the Headingley Test last summer . ‘People ask me whether I shouldn’t have done better in my international career,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I tell them I can sleep at night because I tried my hardest. ‘Could I have been more self-aware? Yes, definitely. Did I learn more after I passed 30? Yes, definitely. If I’d known then what I know now, it would have been great. ‘I’ve had 25 years in the game, so there’s a lot of experience to draw on – both good and bad. It’s very important to understand the stresses and strains that go on at international level, the importance of confidence and self-belief, and how fragile they can be. ‘I’ll try to empathise with the players. If I see someone struggling or withdrawing or over-thinking – that’s when I can help.’ Ramprakash, 45, observed the process at first hand over the summer as Cook appeared at times to be doing battle as much with himself as with the Sri Lankan and Indian bowlers. ‘I was struck by the relentless, sustained criticism of the England captain,’ said Ramprakash, who took on a more hands-on role after England’s batsmen surrendered to Ishant Sharma’s bouncers during the second Test against India at Lord’s. ‘The demands are huge on a captain these days. Alastair has to do three interviews after the toss, then 10 minutes later he’s strapping on his pads to open the batting for England. ‘If you start to struggle with your game in those circumstances, it can be hugely challenging. He showed tremendous strength of character to make that 95 at Southampton.’ It was the kind of knock you suspect Ramprakash wishes he had been able to summon up more often during his own international career: gritty, unself-conscious, indifferent to whether he had just been beaten outside off. And it is the mental side of the game he will be working on now. Ramprakash plays his favourite shot, a cover drive, for England against New Zealand in 1999 . A dejected Ramprakash walks off after being out for 25 against West Indies in 1991 . ‘When people talk about me as a player, they often think of the technical side,’ he said. ‘But at this level you hope the techniques of the players are pretty good already. It’s more a question of what’s going on between the ears. It’s helping players to feel confident, reinforcing their beliefs, evolving their game, provoking thought.’ Ramprakash already has one foot in the door. Even before he worked part-time with the England team over the summer, he had coached his old club Middlesex and worked with the Lions. Batsmen such as Joe Root, Gary Ballance and Moeen Ali are used to his methods: ‘They’re a very talented group.’ But his first full-time role will be to help prepare England for next year’s World Cup. It’s been nearly 23 years since they last mounted a credible tilt at the title, and expectations are not high. Ramprakash is congratulated by Darren Gough after scoring his 100th first-class hundred in 2008 . ‘It’s fair to say England are a wildcard,’ said Ramprakash. ‘We want to try to take pressure off the players, and if they feel they’re underdogs, that’s fine. I’ve seen when playing against teams with nothing to lose that it can really free you up. I think that no-fear attitude is the way to go. ‘Someone like Alex Hales looks comfortable and clear with his Nottinghamshire shirt on. I want to encourage him to find that clarity whenever he has an England shirt on too.’ And no one can say Ramprakash hasn’t reached his own clarity the hard way.","Mark Ramprakash succeeds Graham Gooch as England batting coach .

"This is the police sergeant who fired a crazed gunman square in the chest from 312 feet away while holding the reins of two horses in one hand. Adam Johnson, of Austin Police Department in Texas, was on mounted patrol at 2.33am when Larry McQuilliams tore past him firing more than 100 rounds at buildings using AK-47 and .22-caliber rifles. The pre-dawn rampage the day after Thanksgiving came to an abrupt halt when Johnson responded with one pistol shot that has made him a hero in the eyes of gun-proud Texans. Scroll down for video . Incredible shot: Sgt Adam Johnson was holding two horses with one hand when he fired at crazed gunman Larry McQuilliams, 49, whom he saw tearing through Austin, Texas, firing with two rifles 312 feet away . 'I would say what this officer did was phenomenal, especially if he didn't brace his arm against anything,' Army Major John Plaster, a long-range shooting expert, told Fox News. Plaster added: 'At minimum it was an extraordinary shot.' McQuilliams, 49, was pronounced dead at the scene. A post mortem examination will confirm whether it was Johnson's Smith & Wesson M&P .40 pistol which dealt the fatal shot. Rampage: McQuilliams was armed with numerous weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition on his raid . Attack: He had a map of 34 downtown Austin buildings which he appeared to be targeting with two rifles . An initial investigation found McQuilliams was following a meticulously mapped route of the city's downtown buildings - including the Mexican consulate, the federal court house and a bank - armed with numerous firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Johnson was leading a 12-member patrol unit shortly before his shift was due to end. 'For a guy to keep his composure and holding two horses with one hand and taking a one-hand shot with the other hand, it says a lot about the training and professionalism of our police department,' Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said.","Sgt Adam Johnson was on mounted patrol at 2.33am in Austin, Texas .

"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi made their peace at Old Trafford – but the fans that came out to see them will have left feeling short-changed. The superstar pair gave each other an affectionate if slightly awkward embrace as they led their respective countries out for Tuesday's international friendly and shook hands again before kick-off as they tried to counter claims of a bitter rivalry between them. But there was great disappointment among supporters who had paid up to £60-a-ticket that neither man re-appeared for the second half as the contest billed as grudge match petered out into a meaningless exhibition. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats . Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi shake hands before Portugal's clash with Argentina at Old Trafford on Tuesday . Raphael Guerreiro scored a dramatic winner in injury time as Portugal beat Argentina in a friendly in Manchester . Argentina: Guzman 6, Roncaglia 5.5, Biglia 6, Demichelis 5.5, Ansaldi 6 (Silva 71, 5.5), Mascherano 7, Otamendi 5.5, Pastore 6.5 (Pererya 73, 5), Di Maria 6 (Tevez 61, 5), Higuain 5.5 (Lamela 61, 5), Messi 7 (Gaitan 45, 6). Booked: Ansaldi. Portugal:: Beto 6.5, Bosingwa 6, Bruno Alves 6, Pepe 5.5 (Fonte 45, 6), Tiago Gomes 5.5 (Guerreiro, 6); Nani 5, Moutinho 6, Danny 5.5 (Eder 45, 5.5), Tiago 6 (Carvalho, 77) , Andre Gomes 5.5 (Silva 68, 5.5), Ronaldo 7 (Quaresma 45, 6) Goals: Guerreiro 90, . Booked: Moutinho, Tiago Mendes . Referee: Martin Atkinson (England) - 7. Ratings by JOE BERNSTEIN at Old Trafford . An unapologetic Argentina manager Gerardo Martino said afterwards: 'It was always our plan to take him (Messi) off at half-time,' while Portuguese boss Fernando Santos preferred to hail Ronaldo's brief return to the club he graced between 2003 and 2009. 'He is a legend here, one of many legends. I grew up watching Denis Law. The club itself is a legend.' Only 41,000 turned up at the so-called Theatre of Dreams. Those who suspected the showdown between the world's best two players would turn out to be mere hype were proved right. The two icons did their bit for 45 minutes and then left the stage without a backward glance. Without them the match descended into an exhibition and the only surprise was that Portugal managed to score a half-decent goal to win the match in injury-time. Two of the 11 substitutes used on a stop-start evening were heavily involved with Ricardo Quaresma's cross from the left met with a diving header by left-back Raphael Guerreiro. Old Trafford wasn't packed to the rafters with the top tier shut off to reduce the stadium's capacity to around 45,000. In the end, they couldn't completely fill the remaining space anyway. Even so, promoters World XI knew a global television audience would tune in to compare the two footballing icons of their generation and the only winners of FIFA's World Player of the Year since 2007. It made for a terrific picture as the two famous men led their teams out side-by-side as rival captains. Guerreiro headed home Ricardo Quaresma's cross in injury time to seal victory for Portugal .

Portugal celebrate their winning goal (left) as Martin Demichelis and Nani share a heated exchange (right) Ronaldo was back on familiar turf as he returned to Old Trafford, where he used to play with Manchester United . Messi and Ronaldo smile as they talk on the pitch at Old Trafford during the first half . Both men seemed keen to end any hostilities between them, caused by allegations that Ronaldo's associates refer to Messi as 'the dwarf'. They greeted each other in the tunnel, a friendly handshake accompanied by a mutual pat on the back and broad smile. Ronaldo even reached over to briefly put his arm round Messi as a peace offering. The problem for Ronaldo is that while he is comparable to Messi in terms of talent and status, his Portugal side are grossly inferior to Argentina as a unit. The World Cup finalists hardly broke sweat and should have had the match wrapped up in the first 25 minutes. Angel di Maria, the £60million Premier League record signing and not a bad supporting player to Messi, curled a low shot narrowly wide before the little magician tried an audacious attempt from an acute angle and hit the base of the post. Messi and Ronaldo both lasted just 45 minutes at Old Trafford. Here are their stats and heat maps. The Real Madrid forward was withdrawn at half-time of the international friendly with the scores level . Barcelona star Messi also played 45 minutes for the World Cup runner-up Argentina on Tuesday night . Javier Pastore then had a header saved at full-stretch by Beto before Messi curled a free-kick just over. The only worry for Argentina – and watching United manager Louis van Gaal – came when Di Maria had his foot stamped on by Nani, ironically still one of his players albeit on loan at Sporting Lisbon. It was surprising that Di Maria was allowed to continue after finally getting to his feet and lasted an hour before he was replaced by Carlos Tevez. Of course, any foothold Portugal gained in the game was exclusively down to Ronaldo. He brought Old Trafford to its feet by turning a couple of Argentine defenders inside-out before firing over. Martin Demichelis of Manchester City was then booked for blatantly body-checking Ronaldo, naturally earning disapproval from the crowd. Messi reacts after missing a chance during the first half of the international in Manchester . Supporters at Old Trafford hold up signs saying 'welcome home Ronaldo' ahead of the clash at Old Trafford . In fact United fans seemed to be leaning towards supporting Portugal despite Di Maria's presence. That said a lot about the popularity of Ronaldo but also the four City players in Argentina's squad with Pablo Zabaleta, Sergio Aguero and Willy Caballero on the bench, as well as former Red and Blue Carlos Tevez. Those street traders selling half-and-half Messi and Ronaldo scarves outside Old Trafford might not have been aware that both men have scored 29 hat-tricks each in their careers. Messi led the personal head-to-head 12-7 in games played between them. But proof that this wasn't comparable in importance with El Clasico or the 2009 Champions League final came when neither Messi or Ronaldo re-emerged for the second half as both countries embarked on a number of changes. Nani left Angel di Maria on the floor after a late challenge on United's £60m summer signing during the first half . Di Maria looked to be in pain, but carried on after receiving treatment from medical staff at Old Trafford . Argentina's medical staff attend to Di Maria after he was brought down by Nani during the first half . Quaresma was the man who had to fill Ronaldo's boots while Nicolas Gaitan of Benfica had the unenviable task of being the 'new Messi'. Predictably, the intensity and atmosphere dropped significantly with the two main protagonists departed. Argentina were marginally the better team but the crowd voted with their feet, literally, by standing to do a Mexican wave for the last 15 minutes. Despite the late winner, it was a damp squib of a friendly – but at least Ronaldo and Messi are friends.

Anderson, pictured during the Test series against India, has been wrapped in cotton wool by England . 'At present Anderson will not be replaced in the squad for the Sri Lanka tour.' England will take on Sri Lanka in seven ODIs, beginning in Colombo on November 26. Anderson's absence comes on top of the unavailability of Stuart Broad, also ruled out by a knee problem. It means England are without their familiar pace spearheads for the series, with responsibility shifting to Steven Finn, Harry Gurney, Chris Jordan, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes.

"When Turbo-Roo the chihuahua was born without front legs he was reduced to hopping around as his disability left him unable to walk. But two months later and Turbo is living up to his name after being fitted with a 3D printed body harness and skateboard wheels. Turbo was given up at just four weeks old by his first owners who felt unable to care for him, and was taken in by veterinarian technician Ashley Looper. Scroll down for video . Turbo-Roo, a chihuahua born without front legs, was given up by his owners who were unable to care for him. However he was soon adopted and has now been fitted with a 3D printed body harness and a set of wheels . Turbo was adopted by veterinarian technician Ashley Looper who originally fitted him with a set of toy wheels, but launched an online campaign to have a proper set of wheels made . She said: 'I just fell in love with him pretty much instantly. 'I know what it takes to care for a dog as special as him because I have worked with special needs pets in the past so it was just a perfect fit and I adopted him straight away. 'The owners knew that he needed more one-on-one attention and they needed to focus on his mother and the other puppies in the litter. 'When I took him home I made a cart for him to get around in, which I made entirely from toys but I knew he would need something a little more permanent.' Turbo became an internet sensation overnight with his toy wheels but owner Ashley knew he would need something a litter bigger as he grew older. Owner Ashley, from Indianapolis, USA, said: 'I set up an online fundraiser with a picture of Turbo in his toy wheels asking for donations to help him get the new wheels he needed. Despite having an initial target of just $600, Miss Looper raised more than $3,500. She was eventually contacted by a designer who offered to make a cart for Turbo . Turbo was fitted with a 3D printed body harness with a pair of skateboard wheels attached, but still struggled to walk using it as it sagged at the back . After a slight redesign, Mark Dewrick from studio 3dyn fitted a second set of wheels to the cart . 'The donations came flooding in and I was so appreciative and overwhelmed by the love and support from people. 'It wasn't long after that a man who worked for a 3D design company messaged me and said he would make Turbo a cart. 'I messaged him back and it was only four days later that he said he had made a rough draft cart and had sent it to us.' Ashley's online campaign raised a staggering $3,629 (£2,169) five times more than her initial $600 target. Mark Dewrick from San Diego-based studio 3dyn caught wind of the campaign and offered to design a set of wheels for Turbo. The support cart for Turbo was made with a Makerbot 3D-printer and strapped to his back. He was then given a set of luminous green skateboard wheels to complete his  makeover. Ashley said: 'Mark has never asked us for anything, he took Turbo on as a special project and has not asked for any payment. 'When I first took him home he didn't really do much but since then he has become a super cute fun loving puppy. Ahsley (pictured right with Turbo) says Mark didn't charge her for the cart, so she has set the $3,629 donated aside for X-rays and vaccines that Turbo will need as he gets older . Ashley (pictured with partner Ray) says that when she first got him home, Turbo wasn't able to do much, but has now grown into a fun-loving puppy . Turbo became an internet sensation after Miss Looper made him a set of wheels out of spare toy parts . 'He constantly plays and hops around at our House and at work when I am on my lunch and he can do so much he could not do before.' Ashley has now set aside the money that was donated and hopes to use it on bone scans and vaccines that Turbo will need as he gets older. She said: 'I love seeing him grow every day but just like with any puppy you don't want them to grow up. But each day he does something new that makes me so proud to be his mom. 'I want to use the money that was donated to go towards future vet visits such as X-rays and vaccines which he will need to track his bone growth because he will need medication to keep his bones strong. 'He is just a typical chihuahua and although he has his moments where he is fussy and wants what he wants, all in all he is extremely sweet and has such a zest for life.'","Chihuahua Turbo-Roo born without front legs and had to hop everywhere .

"Scroll down for video . Police are searching for a 25-year-old doctor who mysteriously vanished on her way to work on Monday morning. Dr Fehintola Omidele, who goes by the nickname FT, was last seen at dinner with her family in Houston, Texas, on Sunday night. When she did not come in to work at the Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital the next day, her family found her cell phone in her room and her car was missing. Missing: Dr Fehintola Omidele, or 'FT', has not been seen since family dinner in Houston, Texas, on Sunday . Dr Omidele enjoyed a glittering academic career, graduating from high school at 16 with a grade point average of 4.3, before graduating from college at the age of 20. After four days, family and friends have found no trace of KT or her 2011 grey Toyota Camry with the license plate BZ2L971. 'She's extremely responsible, so her not showing up for work and it's been four or five days, is not like her at all,' family friend Dr Omonele Nwokolo told KHOU. Another friend, A'Lys Lawrence, told MailOnline: 'We are broken hearted and doing all that we can to bring her back home safely.' Police say there is no evidence of foul play as they continue to investigate the disappearance. Dr Omidele, who is fluent in Yoruba and English, is described in missing posters as 5'5"", weighing 120 pounds. Appeal: Friends issued this poster  to trace her car which is also missing. Her cell phone was found at home . Star doctor: FT graduated from high school at 16 with a 4.3 grade point average and graduated college at 20 . Hailing from Nigeria, her family moved to New Orleans when she was eight, then to Katy, Texas, when she was 12. According to the Houston Chronicle, she graduated high school with a 4.3 grade point average - out of a possible 5.0 - at the age of 16. She was 20 when she enrolled in graduate medical school after majoring in biology and child development at the University of Texas. 'Extremely responsible': Friends claim FT's disappearance earlier this week is completely out of character . In a profile done on Dr Omidele in April, she told the Chronicle: 'I've always loved children. I'm drawn to them. Personally, I consider myself a kid at heart. In college, I worked at the child development center.' She graduated in May, when she started her three-year pediatrics placement at the Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston. One day, she said, she hopes to work for the French non-governmental organization Doctors Without Borders.","Dr Fehintola Omidele, 25, last seen at family dinner in Houston on Sunday .

"England's Stuart Broad and Joe Root have been named in the International Cricket Council's Test team of the year. The mythical side, selected by a panel chaired by the ICC cricket committee chairman and former India captain Anil Kumble, sees Broad and Root rewarded for their work in helping rebuild the England side after their disastrous tour of Australia. Root made three big hundreds in the English summer, scoring 200, 154 and 149, while Broad - one of the few bright spots Down Under - made contributions with both bat and ball and took 19 wickets as India were beaten 3-1.

"Michigan police officers have been deemed 'heroic' after taking down a rampaging knifeman without shooting him dead after he stabbed three passengers and a conductor on an Amtrak train. Michael Williams, 44, from Saginaw, allegedly attacked two men, one woman and an employee at a station near N 6th Street and Pokagon Street in Niles, 100 miles east of Chicago, on Friday evening. Within seconds, police stormed the train and spotted Wilson wielding a knife, it is said. But instead of firing at the suspect, they subdued him with a Taser, before handcuffing him and taking him to jail. The train's conductor was rushed to hospital in a critical condition, while the other victims were treated for less serious injuries. They have now all been stabilized, according to reports. It comes just a day after Los Angeles police officers shot dead an apparently armed man near the city's famous Hollywood and Highland intersection in front of dozens of shocked tourists.

Niles Police Chief, Jim Millin, said officers had been dispatched to the Amtrak station following a report of a passenger acting suspiciously on the train from Chicago to Port Huron in Michigan. Speaking of the moment they arrived on the platform shortly after 7pm, Mr Millin said: 'They saw commotion in the train car. They had to forcefully work their way through the crowd. 'As soon as the first officer turned into the car, Mr Williams was less than 10 feet away and he had the knife in his hand. The officer used his Taser and was able to subdue him.'

"A $5,000 cross was stolen from a church in the Bronx on Wednesday . One very brazen criminal, or group of criminals, did the unthinkable when they robbed one New York City church of a religious artifact. Police say that a $5,000 cross was reported missing Wednesday night from the lobby of Saint Anthony of Padua in the Bronx's Morrisania neighborhood. What's more, the crucifix appears to have been stolen during an actual mass. 'I’m distressed. That crucifix means so much to the people here … I’ve never seen anything like this,' Pastor Josu Iriondo told the New York Post. As for who might be responsible, he said, 'It’s someone who knew what they were doing. They had to be professionals.' Pastor Iriondo also believes whoever took the crucifix was likely their before, having planned out the heist ahead of time. Now he, and his congregation, are praying for the crucifix's safe return. 'That cross means so much to people even passing by. We could save one or two persons by just looking at it,' Pastor Iriondo said. Making this case even more odd is the name of the church. Saint Anthony is the patron saint of stolen goods. Police are asking anyone with information about the missing crucifix to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS.","A $5,000 cross was reported missing Wednesday night from the lobby of Saint Anthony of Padua church in the Bronx .

"Sachin Tendulkar has revealed that he missed the moment India won the cricket World Cup in 2011 because he was busy praying. Tendulkar said he was superstitious at the Wankhede Stadium during the final against Sri Lanka and tried to repeat what he had been doing as India beat Australia in the quarterfinals. 'Unfortunately I missed that last moment,' Tendulkar said at the launch of his book 'Playing it My Way' - attended by former India captains Sunil Gavaskar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly among others. Sachin Tendulkar has revealed that he chose to pray instead of watching India win the 2011 World Cup . Tendulkar was speaking at the launch of his new autobiography 'Playing It My Way' on Wednesday . 'I was not watching it live even though I was inside the stadium. I was praying. I was a little superstitious because when we were playing Australia in Ahmedabad, I was not watching - I'd put my head down on the massage table and was being attended to by the team physio. Viru (Virender Sehwag) had been sitting next to me... So I continued that in the World Cup final.' Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (91 not out) hit the winning runs to seal a World Cup victory which Tendulkar said at the time was 'the proudest moment of my life.' Tendulkar was the second highest run-scorer in the tournament with 482, after topping in two previous World Cups. He aggregated 673 runs when India reached the final in 2003 and 523 when India made the semifinals in 1996. Tendulkar, who retired from international cricket last year with a record 15,921 runs and 51 centuries in 200 tests and 18,426 runs with 49 centuries in 463 one-dayers, will release his book internationally on Thursday .

"Adnan el Shukrijumah, chief of global operations for Al-Qaeda, was killed in a raid by Pakistani military this morning . An Al-Qaeda leader accused of planning to bomb the London Underground and New York Metro has been killed during a raid in Pakistan, the country's military said. Adnan el Shukrijumah, chief of global operations for the terrorist group, was killed along with two other suspected militants in Shinwarsak, South Waziristan, early this morning. The 'most wanted' terrorist was found hiding in a compound after fleeing from a  North Waziristan tribal district where the army launched a major operation against militant bases in June. 'The al-Qaida leader, who was killed by the Pakistan army in a successful operation, is the same person who had been indicted in the United Stated,' said a senior Pakistani army officer. Shukrijumah, who lived in the US for 15 years, was accused of playing a role in plots against the London Underground and trains in Norway that never came to fruition. He took over a position once held by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the September 11 World Trade Center attacks, who was captured in 2003. Federal prosecutors in the U.S. allege Shukrijumah recruited three men in 2008 to receive training in the lawless tribal region of Pakistan for carrying out attacks. The New York indictment links him to the Manhattan plot and a similar never-executed scheme to attack British subways. There had been a £3.2million reward available for information leading to his arrest. Pakistan military spokesman Major General Asim Bajwa said in a tweet that five 'terrorists' were also arrested during the raid. After the September 11 terror attacks, Shukrijumah was seen as one of al-Qaida's best chances to attack inside the U.S. or Europe, captured terrorist Abu Zubaydah told U.S. authorities. He lived in the US for 15 years but rose to a prominent position in Al-Qaeda and took over a position once held by the mastermind of the September 11 World Trade Center attacks . He studied at a community college in Florida but when the FBI showed up to arrest him as a material witness to a terrorism case in 2003, he already had left the country. The US authorities believe he visited Trinidad and London on his way to al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan where he started with lowly camp duties. The FBI has been searching for Shukrijumah since 2003 but moved him up their wanted list when three men accused of plotting suicide bomb attacks on New York's subway system last year named him as their key liaison in Pakistan.","Adnan el Shukrijumah was killed along with two other suspected militants .

Hostage Lorenzo Vinciguerra bravely fled from his kidnappers during a clash between insurgents and governments troops in the southern Philippines. The 49-year-old and Dutch photographer Ewold Horn had been captured in February 2012 by rebels of the Aby Sayyaf group while on a bird-watching trip in Tawi-Tawi province. Scroll down for video . Hostage Lorenzo Vinciguerra, 49, who has been held captive for more than two years, managed to escape from his kidnappers during a clash between insurgents and governments troops in the southern Philippines . As gunfire broke out, the photographer wrestled with his guard to grab the weapon. He is seen being transferred to Zamboanga city, inside a military camp in Jolo, Sulu province, after his escape . Today, a Philippine officer revealed how, as gunfire broke out between the two sides in the remote jungle where he was kept, the photographer began wrestling with his guard to grab the machete.

He then fled from his abductors, who had been keeping him on the southern island of Jolo, Mindanao. Talking to reporters by text message, Colonel Allan Arrojado, commander of the army's Joint Task Group on the island of Sulu, said: 'He dashed while other bandits were shooting at him.'

According to Arrojado, Mr Vinciguerra also shouted at Mr Horn run but the Dutch man was said to have been 'very sick and very weak' and unable to escape. He added that there was no word on Horn's whereabouts. Switzerland's Foreign Ministry said Mr Vinciguerra was in good health considering the circumstances. He is still in the custody of the Philippines armed forces and will return to Switzerland as soon as possible, he said. In a statement, the ministry added that it greatly regretted that Horn was 'still in captivity'. It did not elaborate further.

"Hugh Hefner and Bill Cosby have been friends for years, but with more allegations coming forward every single day of woman claiming they were drugged and raped by Cosby, Hefner seems to have put his foot down. The head of Playboy issued a statement saying, 'Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening. He then added, 'I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved.' This after a former Playboy bunny accused the embattled comedy legend of drugging and raping her - and sexually assaulting 12 other Playboy bunnies. Scroll down for videos . Friends no more?: Hugh Hefner has released a statement distancing himself from pal Bill Cosby after the continued wave of recent rape allegations . Fresh claims: Former Playboy bunny P.J. Masten is the latest woman to claim Bill Cosby drugged and raped her . 'I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved,' said Hefner . P.J. Masten, from New Jersey, said she was in her 20s and working at Playboy's famous Chicago club in the late 1970s when she met the star, who then invited her out to lunch. A dinner date soon followed, at the end of which, she claims she woke up naked and bruised in a bed after being drugged and attacked by Cosby, adding: 'There were bruise marks all over me. I knew I was raped.' And in shocking claims, Masten - real name Patricia - told CNN: '(There are) 12 former bunnies that I know of that are ashamed to come forward, frightened to come forward, married with families (and) don't want to come forward. But they were also drugged and raped by Bill Cosby.' P.J. Masten donned the famous bunny ears, tight-fitting corset and fluffy tail for her job as a waitress at the Chicago club. She started working for Playboy in 1972 in her home state of New Jersey and went on to work in LA and Chicago for the organisation. Allegations:  P.J. Masten, pictured with Cosby, first met the star in the Playboy club in Chicago . Coming forward: P.J. Masten say she was prompted to come forward by Judy Huth, who claims Cosby attacked her when she was 15 at the Playboy mansion . She said she first met Cosby in Chicago and he invited her to lunch, telling CNN how he jumped behind the counter to make hot dogs, saying: 'Everybody was in there laughing. It was a lot of fun.' The next day, she said the comic called and asked her to dinner and told her to meet her at the Whitehall Hotel. Email: tips@dailymail.co.uk . Going up to his room, she was greeted by four of his friends who were watching sports with the star, and smoking cigars and playing cards. Cosby asked Masten if she wanted a cocktail before dinner and she drank a glass of Grand Marnier and ice he handed her. 'The next thing I knew, it was 4 o'clock in the morning,' she told CNN: 'I woke up in a bed naked, bruised. He was laying next to me, and I slithered out of the bed... I got myself together, I went downstairs, I got in a cab, and I went home.' Asked if she knew what had happened, Masten said: 'There were bruise marks all over me. I knew I was raped.' Masten said she told her supervisor at the Playboy club soon after the alleged assault, only to be told: 'You know that's Hef's best friend, right?', referring to Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. Masten recalled: 'I said, 'Yes.' She said, 'Well, nobody is going to believe you. I suggest you keep your mouth shut'.' The blonde said she's been in therapy for years - but said she had been prompted to come forward decades later by Judy Huth, who claims Cosby attacked her at the Playboy mansion in LA when she was just 15 in 1974. Huth is suing the star for sexual assault - but Cosby is suing her, calling her claims 'absolutely false' and accusing her lawyer of extortion. Lawsuit: Bill Cosby is accusing Judy Huth, who says he attacked her when she was 15, of extortion. She has launched a lawsuit against him for sexual assault . P.J. Masten speaks to CNN's Alisyn Camerota . Former Playboy bunny Carla Ferrigno in circa 1980 in Los Angeles, California, with her husband, actor and bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno. She claims Cosby assaulted her too . Victoria Valentino, a former Playboy Playmate in 1963, has come out to say Bill Cosby raped her as well. However, Masten said: 'That was it for me. This man has to be held accountable. He's a serial rapist. He's been that way since the '60s.' And she is convinced there are other Playboy bunnies with similar experiences of Cosby. She said Cosby has come up at a recent reunion of Playboy bunnies, as well as in blogs and Facebook pages restricted to them. The public allegations stirred up lots of private conversations, involving a number of women, Masten says. Demands: Attorney Gloria Allred is flanked by Bill Cosby accusers at her office on Wednesday, from left, Chelan Lasha, Beth Ferrier and Helen Hayes . Weeping: Chelan Lasha, now a grandmother, breaks down on Wednesday afternoon as she claims that Cosby drugged and assaulted her when she was 17 . 'A couple of (them) private messaged me and said, 'He did me too. It happened to me, too',' she told CNN. Cosby, now 77, is accused of attacking 20 women, and has so far remained silent amid the myriad of claims. However, his lawyer Marty Singer launched legal action against Judy Huth this week, accusing her of making up claims of assault and demanding $33,295 in damages. In another link between Playboy and Cosby, another accuser, Carla Ferrigno, says she was an 18-year-old Playboy bunny when she went with a male friend to Cosby's Beverly Hills home in 1967 and he kissed her roughly after her date left the room. Meanwhile, Playboy playmate Victoria Valentino says a friend introduced her to Cosby hoping to help her get work on his show I Spy in the late 1960s. She alleges he gave her pills at dinner to 'cheer up', after which she felt 'stoned' as he took her to another place. There, Valentino said Cosby pushed himself near her mouth, before turning her around and raping her. Asked by CNN why she didn't speak out about the incident until recently, Valentino said, 'As a playmate, I thought, who would believe me?' Attorney Gloria Allred has challenged Cosby to pay $100 million in damages to the women who claim he sexually assaulted them. The lawyer this week introduced three alleged victims - two who have never spoken before - and as they broke down in tears, she told Cosby he could waive the statute of limitations so all the women accusing him of assault could have their day in court. The woman who started it all: Andrea Constand, a former basketball player, sued Cosby in 2005 and settled later on. Beth Ferrier was Jane Doe No 5 in Andrea's civil court case . Emotional: Former supermodel Janice Dickinson says Cosby drugged and raped her in 1982 . Alleged victims: Tamara Green (left) and Barbara Bowman (right) join the ranks of woman who claim Cosby assaulted them . If not, she said, he could stump up $100 million - and the money would be handed out to the women by a committee of retired judges. Speaking at her California law offices, Miss Allred said she had been forced to tell many women who had contacted her to report abuse at the hands of the comic legend that they were too late to file a lawsuit due to the statute of limitations. However, she said: 'Today, I am here to propose two new solutions to this public dilemma and a away to determine if Bill Cosby is a saint of a sexual predator.' She said that if Cosby is 'confident' he has done nothing wrong, he could waive the statute of limitations, adding: 'Then his alleged victims would have an opportunity to have their allegations dealt with on their merits. 'Bill Cosby would have an opportunity to address there allegations in a court of law and the victims and Mr Cosby would have an opportunity to have a judge and jury decide who should be believed.' Chelan Lasha, from California - now believed to be a 46-year-old Grandmother- claimed that Cosby attacked her when she was just 17 in 1986 when she was an aspiring model. 'I laid down,' she said: 'He laid down next to me on the bed and began pinching my left nipple and humping my leg while he was grunting. 'I could not open my eyes. I couldn't move or say anything. I felt something warm on my legs. Then I blacked out.' 'Thirteen to sixteen hours later I woke up by hearing Mr Cosby clapping his hands and saying 'Daddy says wake up'. He gave me $1500. He said the money was to buy something nice for me and my grandmother and he also invited me to go to the Temptations show with my grandmother. 'My grandmother went but I did not go because I was too sick. Then he invited us to his show. My grandmother really want to go. I did not, but I went with her and heckled him. As a result, I was fired from my job.' No comment: Bill Cosby yesterday thanked Whoopi Goldberg and singer Jill Scott for their support on Twitter - but has made no public statement . Chelan was joined by two other women, Helen Hayes, who claims Cosby fondled her breast after stalking her and her friends 'like a predator' after they met in the summer of 1973. Beth Ferrier, meanwhile, who has already come forward, alleges that she had an affair with Cosby, which ended in him drugging and raping her - and leaving her to come to in her car in an alleyway. She was Jane Doe 5 in the civil suit brought against Cosby by Andrea Costand, the first woman to allege he had attacked her, in 2005. Former basketball player Andrea ended up settling out of court.","Hugh Hefner has issued a statement on the recent wave of rape allegations against his best friend Bill Cosby .

Krystle Campbell, 29, was named as the second person to die in the Boston Marathon outrage.She had joined her friend, Karen Rand, near the finishing line to cheer on Karen’s boyfriend in the race. The pair were caught in the first explosion, and father William Campbell and his wife spent 12 hours believing that doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital were operating on their daughter’s leg.

When doctors allowed the couple in at 2am to see the patient, they were horrified to discover their recovering patient was Karen. Mr Campbell said: ‘I said, “That’s not my daughter, that’s Karen! Where’s my daughter?” The doctors were as shocked as we were.’ An hour later, a police detective arrived and showed them a picture of their daughter, a steakhouse restaurant manager from Medford, Massachusetts.

Mourning: Patty Campbell (top right), mother of Boston Marathon explosion victim Krystle Campbell, told reporters that she couldn't have asked for a better daughter . ‘I almost passed out on the floor,’ said Mr Campbell.

People are out there enjoying a beautiful day and then to have this happen.’ He added: ‘And then the little boy that passed. It’s totally tragic.’ The mayor of Medford, Krystle’s home town, said he had attempted to console Mr Campbell. ‘Mr Campbell said that she certainly was a dream daughter, the daughter that every father dreams to have and friends of hers said that she was eager about life,’ said Mayor Michael McGlynn.

"Blue is the most common eye colour in Britain, researchers found. All eyes in the country were once brown, but a study revealed they are now 48 per cent blue, 30 per cent green and 22 per cent brown. The study, which mapped out eye colour across the UK and Ireland, revealed that the Scots and the Irish are more likely to have blue eyes than others - especially those living in the south. Scientists believe the reason for the increase in the number of blue eyes could be to do with how attractive people find them. Scroll down for videos . Blue-eyed Britain: The study, carried out by ScotlandsDNA, revealed that the Scots and Irish were most likely to have blue eyes - with the largest population occurring in south east Scotland . South East Scotland reported the highest . proportion of blue-eyed residents - 57 per cent - while blue eyes are . least common in South West England, where they account for just 35 per . cent. South East . and East England have similarly low proportion of blue-eyed residents - . just 44 and 41 per cent respectively - while in all regions of Ireland . at least half of people have blue eyes. Alistair . Moffat of ScotlandsDNA, which carried out the study, said he was . surprised at the findings. He told The Times: ‘A lot of people think . blue eyes are much rarer than they are.’ He . said the colour may be more dominant because it is regarded as . attractive, adding: ‘It may be that blue eyes are like the peacock’s . tail. It doesn’t confer any evolutionary advantage … except that it gets . him more mates.’ Blue-eyed . Hollywood stars Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Nicole Kidman, Hugh . Grant, Kate Winslet and Paul Newman all support the theory that blue . eyes add to a person's sexual appeal. Mr Moffat . added: ‘All of them have inherited their eye colour …  through their . DNA, and because of the way that blue eyes deal with light, they also . appear to have inherited a natural sparkle. Blue-eyed beauties: Sought-after actresses Kate Winslet, left, and Nicole Kidman are among those who support the theory that blue eyes are on the rise because they are regarded as attractive . Classic good looks: Paul Newman, pictured right in 1969 film Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, and Daniel Craig both have blue eyes, which scientists think could be better for attracting mates than other colours . 'Dark-coloured eyes … are able to absorb longer and shorter wavelengths and therefore they appear not to reflect [light].’ The . researchers who carried out the study now aim to discover why the . distribution of blue eyes varies so significantly across the UK. The colour is the result of a variant in the HERC2 gene ‘switching off’ the melanin that forms brown eyes. People with green eyes have a combination of blue and brown variants. The project’s Dr Jim Wilson said brown may overtake blue again, adding: ‘If rarity makes a feature more attractive then it could be that this process is reversed.’","All eyes in the country were once brown, but now they are 48% blue .

"Hate crime: 16-year-old Dwayne Jones was beaten to death by a mob in Jamaica after they discovered the transgender teen was born a man . Dwayne Jones was relentlessly teased in high school for being effeminate until he dropped out. His father not only kicked him out of the house at the age of 14 but also helped jeering neighbors push the youngster from the rough Jamaican slum where he grew up. By age 16, the teenager was dead - beaten, stabbed, shot and run over by a car when he showed up at a street party dressed as a woman. His mistake: confiding to a friend that he was attending a 'straight' party as a girl for the first time in his life. 'When I saw Dwayne's body, I started shaking and crying,' said Khloe, one of three transgendered friends who shared a derelict house with the teenager in the hills above the north coast city of Montego Bay. Like most transgenders and gays in Jamaica, Khloe wouldn't give a full name out of fear. 'It was horrible. It was so, so painful to see him like that.' International advocacy groups often portray this Caribbean island as the most hostile country in the Western Hemisphere for gays and transgendered people. After two prominent gay rights activists were murdered, a researcher with the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch in 2006 called the environment in Jamaica for such groups 'the worst any of us has ever seen.' Local activists have since disputed that label, but still say homophobia is pervasive. Dwayne's horrific July 22 murder has made headlines in newspapers on the island and stirred calls in some quarters for doing more to protect Jamaica's gay community, especially those who live on the streets and resort to sex work. Advocates say much of the homophobia is fueled by a nearly 150-year-old anti-sodomy law that bans anal sex as well as by dancehall reggae performers who flaunt anti-gay themes. The island's main gay rights group estimated that two homosexual men were killed for their sexual orientation last year, and 36 were the victims of mob violence. For years, Jamaica's gay community has lived so far underground that their parties and church services were held in secret locations. Most gays have stuck to a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy of keeping their sexual orientation hidden to avoid scrutiny or protect loved ones. 'Judging by comments made on social media, most Jamaicans think Dwayne Jones brought his death on himself for wearing a dress and dancing in a society that has made it abundantly clear that homosexuals are neither to be seen nor heard,' said Annie Paul, a blogger and publications officer at Jamaica's campus of the University of the West Indies. Victims: Jones's roommate Keke, left, and Khloe were also at the party. Khloe was also beaten and nearly raped in the attack. She bares her injuries on the right . Some say the hostility partly stems from the legacy of slavery when black men were sometimes sodomized as punishment or humiliation. Some historians believe that practice carried over into a general dread of homosexuality. But in recent years, emboldened young people such as Dwayne have helped bring the island's gay and transgender community out of the shadows. A small group of gay runaways now rowdily congregates on the streets of Kingston's financial district. Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller's government has also vowed to put the anti-sodomy law to a 'conscience vote' in Parliament, and she said during her 2011 campaign that only merit would decide who got a Cabinet position in her government. By contrast, former Prime Minister Bruce Golding said in 2008 that he would never allow homosexuals in his Cabinet. Dane Lewis, executive director of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays, said there were increasing 'pockets of tolerance' on the island. 'We can say that we are becoming more tolerant. And thankfully that's because of people like Dwayne who have helped push the envelope,' said Lewis, one of the few Jamaican gays who will publicly disclose his full name. Yet rights groups still complain of the slow pace of the investigation into Jones' murder, despite the justice minister calling for a full probe. Police spokesman Steve Brown said detectives working the case are struggling to overcome a chronic problem: a strong anti-informant culture that makes eyewitnesses to murders and other crimes too afraid or simply unwilling to come forward. Even though some 300 people were at the dance party in the small riverside community of Irwin, police have yet to make a single arrest in Dwayne's murder. Hard life: Jones dropped out of school due to harassment and was kicked out of her house by age 14 . Police say witnesses have said they couldn't see the attackers' faces. Dwayne was the center of attraction shortly after arriving in a taxi at 2am with his two 23-year-old housemates, Khloe and Keke. Dwayne's expert dance moves, long legs and high cheekbones quickly made him the one that all the guys were trying to get next to. Like most Jamaican homosexuals, Dwayne was careful about confiding in others about his sexual orientation. But when he saw a girl he had known from church, he told her he was attending the party in drag. Minutes later, according to Khloe and Keke, the girl's male friends gathered around Dwayne in the dimly-lit street asking: 'Are you a woman or a man?' One man waved a lighter's flame near Dwayne's sneakers, asking whether a girl could have such big feet. Then, his friends said, another man grabbed a lantern from an outdoor bar and walked over to Dwayne, shining the bright light over him from head to toe. 'It's a man,' he concluded, while the others hissed 'batty boy' and other anti-gay epithets. Khloe says she tried to steer him away from the crowd, whispering in Dwayne's ear: 'Walk with me, walk with me.' But Dwayne pulled away, loudly insisting to partygoers that he was a girl. When someone behind him snapped his bra strap, the teen panicked and raced down the street. But he couldn't run fast enough to escape the mob. The teenager was viciously assaulted and apparently half-conscious for some two hours before another sustained attack finished him off, according to Khloe, who was also beaten and nearly raped.

"Thousands of commuters who travel to work outside of peak hours will be given discounts on season tickets, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has revealed. The cheap rail fares will also be available for people who work part-time as the government plans to cut the cost of regular rail travel by bringing in 'smart ticketing'. Mr McLoughlin admitted that improvements needed to be made for passengers, but said the electronic ticketing scheme would save passengers money. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured on a train to Leeds with David Cameron, said he wanted to cut rail fares for people travelling outside of peak hours by bringing in 'smart ticketing' 'I'm not going to sit here complacently and say everything is fine for the passenger,' the Transport Secretary told the Independent. 'I think there is a lot that still has to be done for the commuter. I am very well aware of the burden of fares.' Ticket prices have continued to rise - up by an average of 4.2 per cent in the last year - and only four in 10 people believe train companies give value for money. Mr McLoughlin plans to bring in electronic 'smart ticketing', similar to the Oyster card scheme in London, which he says will reduce fares. He said: 'Not all commuters want to use the train five days a week. But at the moment it works out cheaper to pay for a season ticket than buying three return journeys a week. 'We have not got the kind of smart ticketing that would make the difference to enable you to purchase six journeys a week rather than pay for 10 journeys a week.' The electronic smart ticketing, which will operate like London's Oyster scheme, will cut rail fares for thousands, Mr McLoughlin said (file picture) A similar initiative by C2C, a rail operator in the east of England, was introduced this week and could be rolled out across the country. The Cabinet minister added that he wanted to make off-peak services cheaper than rush-hour trains, which could alleviate the crush thousands of commuters experience on packed trains. He said: 'We all know that commuter trains are horrendous between 8am and 9am. Now can we get to the situation where somebody gets on their train at 10am is charged a different rate? With smart technology there are a lot more opportunities.' A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail operators and Network Rail, said they were looking into the possibility of smart ticketing. 'We are already exploring new forms of ticketing such as smart cards and mobile ticketing that have the potential to reduce journey times, offer more flexible fares and drive down costs.'","'Smart ticketing' will save money for thousands, Transport Secretary says .

"Time consuming: The big six energy firms have been criticised for making customers wait up to an hour before calls are answered . The big six energy firms have been criticised for making customers wait up to an hour before their calls are answered. Researchers from BBC1's investigative programme Rip-Off Britain recorded call handling times for the UK's largest energy providers. They targeted British Gas, nPower, E.ON, EDF Energy, Scottish Power and SSE, ringing them 14 times each over two days and recording the waiting times. The longest time a caller was kept on hold was with Scottish Power - where it took an infuriating 53 minutes to be connected before the call was cut off. But when researchers ran the company's helpline for new customers, all calls were answered within 90 seconds – with one being picked up within just 31 seconds. On average, it took 34 minutes to be directed to one of the Scottish Power's agents, with the shortest time being 18 minutes, the Daily Star Sunday reported. The firm with the second longest waiting time was nPower, which took an average of 13 minutes and 30 seconds to connect. The shocking findings follow energy regulator Ofgem's report that there have been more complaints about the six firms in the first quarter of 2014 than ever before. Pete Murray from consumer magazine Which? said: 'Energy companies need to up their game and make sure they answer phone calls quickly. 'Existing customers need to be treated in the same way as new customers and that is something energy companies have got to put right.' Scottish Power blamed a new £200million account management system on their dismal call handling times, saying that it had caused a 'dip in customer service levels'. But in another call handling test conducted last year, the company again recorded the worst waiting time for a single call at 46 minutes. The firm now claims to have taken on hundreds of additional call handlers and to have extended call centre opening hours to improve its service. The longest time a caller was kept on hold was with Scottish Power - where it took 53 minutes to be connected before the call was cut off . British Gas performed well in the investigation, with the average waiting time amounting to just 2 minutes and 14 seconds. All six companies told Rip-Off Britain that they are committed to customer service and to dealing with calls quickly. The investigation into waiting times will be aired on Rip- Off Britain tomorrow on BBC1 at 9.15am .","Researchers from BBC1's Rip-Off Britain ran experiment to test call times .

"Lionel Messi has celebrated 10 years since his Barcelona debut this week with the club’s supporters optimistic the arrival of Luis Suarez and the threesome Messi will now help make up along with the former Liverpool striker and Neymar could open another illustrious chapter in his career. ‘SMN’ might not roll off the tongue like the ‘BBC’ but the prospect of Suarez, Messi and Neymar eclipsing Bale, Benzema and Cristiano has Barca fans believing that at the grand old age of 27, and with 10 years at the club already behind him, Messi can be the star of another formidable forward line. From the moment the star signed a serviette at the age of 13 in December 2000 to confirm his arrival at the club's famed La Masia academy, the record books have been rewritten. Messi first exploded on to the scene at Barcelona playing on the left of a front three that boasted Samuel Eto’o and the Argentine’s good friend Ronaldinho. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Messi at 16 starring for Barcelona youth team . Lionel Messi is celebrating 10 years this week since making his Barcelona debut . The back of Messi's shirt has been a familiar site for defenders over the years as they fail to handle him . Messi, here against Chelsea's Asier Del Horno in 2006, has proved a nightmare for defenders . Messi (left) and Neymar (right) have formed a devastating partnership together up front .

Messi (right) was at it again two years later when he put United to the sword, this time at Wembley . Messi celebrates winning the Champions League for the third time after the 2011 victory over United . When Frank Rijkaard was replaced by Pep Guardiola he insisted Ronaldinho was sold and Messi was eventually moved to a more central position with Eto’o and Thierry Henry. That trio won the Champions League in 2009 and when Eto’o was sold Messi linked up with Spain forwards Pedro and David Villa winning the European Cup again in 2011. There were fears that Messi’s star was burning out last season as the burden of carrying Argentina’s World Cup hopes on his shoulders in Brazil began to take their toll. But with the World Cup now behind him the 27-year-old looks back to his mesmerising best once again and ready to break more records. The Neymar connection that stuttered last season has finally sparked into life and the two seem to have a telepathic understanding on the pitch with Messi so often the provider for the Brazilian. The addition of Suarez means it’s not only a front three likely to wow spectators and fill best-goal showreels but also one that will intimidate defences. The work-rate of the Golden Shoe winner means that defences will be under constant pressure and that will bring errors and opportunities for Messi to take advantage. The Argentine has always looked more comfortable with an aggressive, goal-hungry centre forward in the team alongside him. He thrived alongside Eto’o and when Villa replaced Eto’o he benefited from Spain’s record scorer’s presence in the team. Suarez joined Barcelona this summer in a £75m deal from Liverpool after impressing at Anfield . Suarez was awarded the Golden Shoe award after scoring 31 Premier League goals for Liverpool last season . Despite his talents, Messi was unable to inspire Argentina to World Cup glory against Germany this summer . Messi is a four-time Ballon d'Or winner - here he is with the Golden Ball trophy in 2012 .

Luis Enrique is aware that the team has lost its best passer of the ball in Xavi. who is no longer a regular starter. Therefore, he wants to encourage Messi to play a little deeper than in previous seasons to offer up the assists that were once Xavi’s trademark. When the Argentine drops into midfield dragging central defenders with him Enrique wants Suarez filling the vacant space and occupying the centre-forward territory. As well as new team-mates and the slight change to his new position on the pitch there are also new records to be broken. One in particular looms large because of the prospect that it will be achieved in, of all places, the Bernabeu. Legendary Athletic Bilbao striker Telmo Zarra is currently the league’s leading scorer on 251 goals. Messi is just two goals behind on 249. The Argentine might not play 90 minutes on Saturday against Eibar having only arrived back in Spain from international duty late on Wednesday afternoon. If he does not play a full part in the game there is every chance he will not smash the record against the minnows. That sets up the mouthwatering prospect – for Barcelona fans at least – that he will do so against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in 10 days' time. It would leave Madrid fans with the dilemma of whether or not to pay tribute to their most feared rival or not. They showed their class back in 2005 when to a man they stood to clap Ronaldinho after he had destroyed them in a big win for Barca on enemy territory. If Messi can break the record and earn the applause of the Bernabeu in the process he will really have shown once again how there is nothing he is not capable of, even after a decade in the famous red and blue shirt.

"It's literally a case of there is no time like the present for the two giant pandas at Adelaide Zoo who have begun mating calls as their breeding window only lasts about 36 hours. Zoo staff are hopeful that Wang Wang and Funi will bring a little panda into the world as Funi's high-pitched sounds are said to be typical of a female panda undertaking mating behaviour. Now that the pair are sexually mature, experts are more confident than ever as they predict Funi will ovulate within the next 24 hours with her playfulness increasing - especially in the water. If Funi successfully falls pregnant, which wouldn't be detected until about two weeks before birth, it will be the first time a panda is born in the Southern hemisphere. Scroll down for video . The pandas have been placed in each other's enclosures for periods of time to develop their scent-marking behaviour . Wang Wang and Funi have about a 36 hour window to breed once a year at the Adelaide zoo . Zoo staff says the pair are now sexually mature after being at the zoo since 2009 . After artificial insemination was attempted last year, the zoo handlers and the team of specialists have decided to just try the natural breeding this time around. Adelaide Zoo vet David McLelland said staff were the most confident they had been that the pair will breed since the pandas arrived at the zoo from China in 2009. 'They are sexually mature now - we have seen them go through puberty and develop over the last five years since they have been with us,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Last year we were still seeing relatively immature behaviour from Wang Wang so we didn't have any confidence of natural breeding.' Funi's behaviour of late has also been a positive sign. 'She has had an increase of vocalisation and a lot more water play and splashing around rather than being up in the trees - they often only come down when they are receptive,' he said. Funi's high-pitched noises are a sign that she is getting ready for the breeding season . Experts predict Funi will ovulate within the next 24 hours judging from hormone testing taken . Funi's playfulness is another sign that she is getting ready for the short mating season . After putting the pair together for a short unsuccessful period last year, the staff tried artificial insemination. 'Although we saw better signs from them we didn't think putting them together would result in anything, so we tried artificial insemination but it wasn't successful because his sperm count quality wasn't great.' But this year is looking the most positive yet in the five years that the pandas have been living in Australia, as Wang Wang is now nine years-old and Funi is eight. 'We have progressively seen maturity in her and the male looks like he know more what's hes doing as well,' he said . 'So we are a lot more hopeful and we are maximising the opportunity to breed naturally, and if we are not successful this year it will stand us in good stead for the future.' To give the process a little helping hand, the pandas are put in each other's enclosures for periods of time. 'We move them to swap scents from one enclosure to another so their pheromones will be going haywire,' he said. 'When they are exposed to the scents of the opposite sex then it really helps them develop sexually as well.' Dr McLelland said it was not known why pandas had such a small breeding window. The pandas are on loan from China for another four years. If Funi successfully falls pregnant, which wouldn't be detected until about two weeks before birth, it will be the first time a panda is born in the Southern hemisphere . Funi has four more years to fall pregnant in Australia before heading back to China . Wang Wang's sperm count was too low last year and he was not deemed sexually mature enough .","Wang Wang and Funi have only one chance per year to mate .

"On just a normal day in the office, James Fallon made the most shocking discovery of his life. In October 2005, the professor of psychiatry and human behaviour at the University of California was working on his special subject — the brain scans of psychopathic murderers. ‘These are some of the most dangerous people you can imagine,’ he says. ‘They had done some heinous things over the years, things that would make you shudder.’ During 20 years of analysing brain scans, he’d noticed how cold, hardened murderers had alarmingly low activity in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain — the areas associated with empathy and self-control. Without that self-restraint, they became crazed killers. The scan which proved to James Fallon that he was a psychopath . That day in the city of Irvine in Orange County, Professor Fallon was working on genetic tests and brain scans of Alzheimer’s patients, comparing them to the results for his family, used as a control group. Flicking through the family scans, he came across a particularly odd one. It showed all the classic traits of a murderous psychopath. He assumed his family scans had got mixed up with the scans of psychopathic murderers. Horrifyingly, they hadn’t. James Fallon as a young man (left) and (right) as he is today. He believes that the love of his parents kept his psychopathic tendencies from becoming dangerous, unlike his famous ancestor Lizzie Borden . When he cross-checked the reference number, he had the shock of his life. It was a scan of his own brain. The 66-year-old, happily married father of three had led an exemplary existence, with a highly successful career at the top of his field. But he couldn’t deny the evidence staring him in the face. ‘I am basically a normal person, except for one thing. I’m a borderline psychopath,’ he says. The 66-year-old father of three has led a happy life and has excelled in a professional and personal capacity . That wasn’t the end of it. Professor Fallon then searched his family’s DNA for genes that are associated with violence, particularly the ‘warrior gene’, which controls the amount of the hormone serotonin in the brain. Serotonin has a calming effect, unless a person has the warrior gene, which prevents the hormone working its magic. Guess what? Every member of his family had a low-violence genetic structure — except one: Professor Fallon himself. ‘I’m 100 per cent,’ he says. ‘I have the risky pattern. In a sense, I’m a born killer.’ Mr Fallon made the shocking discovery while part of a research project at UC Irvine, he was sifting through thousands of PET scans to find anatomical patterns in the brain that correlated with psychopathic tendencies in the real world . It gets even worse. It turns out that the professor’s ancestors have made a speciality of killing. One day at a barbecue, his 88-year-old mother let slip a dark family secret. ‘Jim, why don’t you find out about your father’s relatives?’ she said. ‘There were some cuckoos back there.’ Pretty violent cuckoos, too. Professor Fallon is related to seven supposed murderers. Among them is one of the most notorious suspected killers in U.S. history, Lizzie Borden, or ‘Cousin Lizzie’, as Professor Fallon jokingly calls her. The Fallon family: Mr Fallon has used brain scans of himself, his wife and children as a control group when he made the discovery . In Massachusetts in 1892, she was tried and acquitted of killing her father and stepmother. Despite her acquittal, she became the subject of one of the most popular skipping rope rhymes in America: . ‘Lizzie Borden took an axe . And gave her mother 40 whacks. When she saw what she had done. She gave her father 41.’ And a direct ancestor, Thomas Cornell, was hanged in 1667 for murdering his mother. The Psychopath Inside is the book that Mr Fallon has written about his research, and the shocking discovery that he, himself is a psychopath . Professor Fallon, though, has never hurt a fly, despite having an overwhelming genetic and neurological tendency towards psychopathy. The realisation of his condition has changed his intellectual approach to the relationship between the brain and a person’s character. Before the discovery, he thought genetics determined your future — character was down to nature, not nurture. He has studied the brain scans of dozens of psychopathic killers and, again and again, has found the same results. Compared to a healthy brain, the killers’ brains had much less activity in the orbital cortex and around the amygdala — the areas that prevent impulsive action and control social behaviour, inhibition, morality and ethics. Examining his own brain scan, he saw the same killer pattern. His brain has dark patches of low activity just behind the eyes, in that crucial orbital cortex area. ‘People with low activity in that area of the brain are free-wheeling types or sociopaths,’ he says. Now he believes the right sort of nurture can overcome the most evil form of nature. And the best sort of nurture comes from adoring parents. ‘I was loved and that has protected me,’ he says. His parents’ love, it seems, saved him from a life of violent crime and steered him towards a highly successful career. But it couldn’t stop the vestiges of his psychopathy emerging in different ways. ‘I’m obnoxiously competitive,’ he says. ‘I won’t let my grandchildren win games and I do things that annoy other people. 'But while I’m aggressive, it is sublimated. I’d rather beat someone in an argument than beat them up.’ In his youth, Fallon suffered from panic attacks and an obsessive compulsive disorder, repeatedly washing his hands. He would stand up to bullies in bars, but never felt the temptation to fight them. ‘While many of the males in my family are athletic and several just love to fight, I never developed a taste for pugilism,’ he says. ‘I prefer to mentally pummel someone than use bare knuckles.’ So, how has his shock discovery changed him? The family control tests that Mr Fallon was studying when he made the discovery that his brain has the characteristics of a psychopath . ‘Since finding all this out and looking into it, I’ve made an effort to try to change my behaviour,’ he says. ‘I’ve consciously been doing what is considered the right thing to do and thinking more about other people’s feelings. ‘At the same time, I’m not doing this because I’m suddenly nice. I’m doing it because of pride, because I want to show to everyone and myself that I can pull it off.’ Professor Fallon’s discovery about himself has made him fine-tune his study of what constitutes a psychopath. There is no rigid psychiatric diagnosis. In fact, it is defined simply as an anti-social personality disorder in which three or more of the following seven conditions feature: irresponsibility, deceit, reckless- ness, indifference to the welfare of others, a failure to plan ahead, aggression and irritability. Professor Fallon says the depictions of psychopaths in horror films and thrillers — such as Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare On Elm Street — are grotesque exaggerations. He also says that Patrick Bateman, the self-loving, unhinged character played by Christian Bale in the film American Psycho, is not representative of a true psychopath. ‘He is too violent to be realistic,’ he says. However, the professor thinks the violent Mafia mobster Tommy DeVito, played by Joe Pesci in Goodfellas, is closer to a realistic depiction of a psychopath. ‘They are relatively normal-looking people who you might pass on the street and not think twice about,’ he says. ‘But they are deeply disturbed individuals who ultimately cannot control their innate aggressiveness and show little regret or sympathy for their violent actions.’ To produce those characteristics, it appears, it’s not enough to have the genetic or neurological psychopath brain pattern. That has to be accompanied by a family history of abuse or violence. Fortunately for Professor Fallon, his family has enabled him to overcome his genetic and neuro-logical characteristics and become what he describes as a pro-social psychopath. ‘I have come to understand that humans are, by nature, complicated creatures,’ he says. ‘And to reduce our actions, motivations, desires and needs to absolutes is doing each of us a disservice. ‘We are not simply good or evil, right or wrong, kind or vindictive, benign or dangerous. ‘We are not simply the product of biology, either. Science can tell us only part of the story.’ Our genes, then, don’t determine our fate, but they have the power to send us in a certain evil direction. How consoling that evil can be defeated by an even greater influence — a parent’s love.","James Fallon was studying brain scans when he made the discovery .

This meeting had been eagerly anticipated from the minute it became known City were travelling north to face Paul Hartley's side, who were similarly fresh from their own title conquest at the end of last season. The visitors have a trio of players still at the World Cup and plenty more recovering from their exploits in Brazil but Pellegrini still sent out a fairly strong side to Tayside which included summer signings Willy Caballero, their new goalkeeper from Malaga and Fernando, their much-vaunted £12m capture from FC Porto, while Spanish winger Jesus Navas and Montenegro striker Stevan Jovetic took their usual places. They took time to grace the Dens Park surface the night before as fans from both sides rolled up to catch a glimpse of the English champions being put through their paces in the build-up to for this late afternoon kick-off.

Battle: Dundee's Kevin McBride (left) tussles for the ball with City striker John Guidetti (right) There were no prizes at stake for this pre-season encounter which had been billed the champions vs champions but the hosts were buoyed by taking a 27th minute lead. Harkins was barged inside the box by Denayer and wasted no time in stepping up to take the resultant spot-kick. His effort was saved by Caballero but the former Kilmarnock and St Mirren man did enough to force home the rebound. Then, on 37 minutes, Dundee had the audacity to go even further ahead. This time Harkins hooked a cross into the box where Tankulic was waiting to send a shot out of the reach of Caballero with the aid of a deflection. City, not surprisingly, made nine changes at half-time, with another new signing, Bruno Zuculini, also getting his first taste of action since joining Pellegrini's side. First team stars Samir Nasri, Alvaro Negredo and Matija Nastasic all joined the action at the break, but none could help the visitors mount a second half comeback. In control: Dundee's Willie Dyer (right) attempts to turn away from City winger Jesus Navas (left) Peter MacDonald, the Dundee substitute, even had a chance to make it 3-0 on 73 minutes as he beat the City offside trap, but his delicate lobbed effort flew just wide.

"US Navy SEALs 'destroyed everything' with the failed attempt to rescue Al-Qaeda hostages just a day before one of them, Pierre Korkie (pictured) was due to be released, the charity he worked for said . US Navy SEALs 'destroyed everything' with the failed attempt to rescue Al-Qaeda hostages just a day before one of them was due to be released, a charity said. South African teacher Pierre Korkie and British-born photojournalist Luke Somers were shot by militants during the raid. But the project director of a charity working with Mr Korkie said would have been freed by the terrorists today. The Navy SEALs landed by helicopter six miles from the Al-Qaeda compound where the hostages were being held. Speaking anonymously to the BBC, senior officials said 40 special forces soldiers, backed by Yemeni troops, advanced to within 100m of the site, but they were spotted by a militant. The terrorist was briefly seen running into the compound, which is likely to be when the hostages were shot. Mr Korkie died on a helicopter and Mr Somers died on board a US navy ship. Gift of the Givers' Yemen project director Anas Hamati said: 'Pierre Korkie was very sick - he had a hernia.' Mr Hamati added that mediators had been working on an 'arrangement to take him out' and that his passport was ready. 'In that time, the attack happened by US special forces in Yemen and that has destroyed everything.' Mr Korkie's wife Yolande said she was 'devastated' to learn of her husband's death and that she had been preparing to leave South Africa for Istanbul  to meet her husband's planned flight from Yemen. A spokesman for the family said today: 'Yolande is extremely distressed, as you can imagine. She had built up hope that Pierre was coming home after so many months of waiting, and now is coming to terms with the fact that he is never coming home. 'She does not hold anyone to blame, she has never even said a bad word about Al Qaeda, she is an extremely strong woman, guided by her faith.' Meanwhile, South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), called on the government to demand an explanation from Washington over the timing. Yolande Korkie, pictured, said Al-Qaeda had agreed to release her husband  from the Yemeni hideout after months of negotiations aided by South African charity Gift of the Givers and a local tribe . Stevens Mokgalapa, the shadow foreign minister, said: 'The DA believes that the South African government must urgently engage with American representatives to get to the bottom of the circumstances that led to Mr Korkie's death, reportedly a day before his captors intended to release him.' The mother-of-two was held with her husband for seven months before her release in January, after South African charity Gift of the Givers convinced Al Qaeda the couple were not American. Ms Korkie had spent the last 11 months campaigning for his freedom which was agonisingly close to fruition after the Muslim charity and local tribal leaders liaised with the jihadists. Yesterday, as she and her children were being comforted at home by family, she thanked those who had secured her freedom and risked their own lives on behalf of her husband. Just hours before Gift of the Givers boss Dr Imtiaz Sooliman briefed reporters after Pierre was gunned down Ms Korkie had texted him that 'the waiting is almost over' for his release. She later wrote: 'Please accept our deep appreciation for your immeasurable commitment ... and the tribes. I am too emotional to speak to Anas [the charity field worker who negotiated with Al Qaeda for her and her husband's freedom] right now. 'But remind him of my words to him in Sana: if anything happens, it is NOT his fault. And neither your or the tribe's fault.' Last night a spokesman for the family said: 'Teaching was Pierre's life. His heart took him to Yemen. He loved teaching the poor.' Dr Sooliman told MailOnline he'd told Mrs Korkie about a premonition he'd had that American forces might attack the compound where her husband  was being held. They were making last-minute arrangements for his liberation in a late-night conversation, even as the audacious rescue attempt was under way. 'We were speaking on the phone after midnight and I said to Yolande, 'if the Americans attack to release the hostages, the danger is Pierre can get killed,' Dr Sooliman told MailOnline. 'She accepted that, she knew there was a real risk of that happening following the threat by Al Qaeda to execute an American. 'She is an incredibly strong woman, she has got stronger every day that we have been working on this. She is calm, she has faith and very resolute. 'We have been handling the negotiations, but she has been informed of every detail, every step of the way.' He added: 'The psychological and emotional devastation to Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was about to be released by al Qaida. 'You can't blame anybody for this. You can't accuse or blame them [US forces]. It's just unfortunate that it happened.' There had been just three sightings of Mr Korkie, who is deaf, since he was captured 18 months ago and there were serious concerns for his fading health. The family had lived in Yemen for four years before Mr and Mrs Korkie were snatched off the street outside their hotel in May last year as they were preparing to fly home for the funeral of Mr Korkie's father. The children returned home without their parents and were cared for by family until their mother's release seven months later. In an interview recorded on the first anniversary of his capture, Mrs Korkie, a therapist who specialises in using horses as healing aides, revealed how she and the children slept in her husband's t-shirts every night and refused to eat his favourite food until his return. British-born photo-journalist Luke Somers, 33, was also killed by Al-Qaeda terrorists during the raid . Mr Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 from Yemen's capital Sana'a (shown in the map above) 'He continues to live in the most difficult circumstances,' she said. 'Time in captivity does not go by in hours, it goes by minute to minute. The world as he knows it has stopped. Surviving becomes the only reality.' Mr Korkie was well-known and liked in the family's small, conservative Afrikaner home town of Bloemfontein, where he was a teacher at the local school and one-time athletics coach to its most famous daughter, Olympic running sensation Zola Budd. Last night, Ms Budd declined to comment on her old friend's death, but her agent said she was 'devastated by the news'. Dr Sooliman revealed that as part of the release plan, Mrs Korkie had written a letter to her husband which was to be given to him by the Abyan tribal leaders to whom Al Qaeda had agreed to hand him over. In the note, written in Afrikaans, she explained that he could trust the men who were helping to get him home in time for Christmas. The architects of 9/11 had even agreed to waive their US $3million ransom for Mr Korkie when they finally confirmed he would be freed three weeks ago. The charity decided to approach the tribal leaders for their assistance after contact with Al Qaeda broke down after Mr Korkie's family had failed to raise the ransom the group had demanded. Mr Korkie's body is held by the US forces. The South African government will liaise with military officials and the Yemeni government for the repatriation of his remains, Nelson Kgwete, a spokesman for the South African government said.","Pierre Korkie was due to be released today after high-level negotiations .

"A care worker broke her spine after jumping from a window to escape a sex attack by a schizophrenic resident who had broken through a wall with a chair to get to her. Jemma Rixon, 20, was working a night shift alone at the Potens voluntary residential home in Birkenhead, Merseyside when she was attacked by schizophrenic resident, Craig Cantwell, in July 2013. After the 30-year-old patient tried to attack her, she managed to fight him off and fled to an adjoining bathroom. But he battered his way through the wall with a chair leg to try and continue the assault where she hid. Jemma Rixon broke her spine after jumping from a window to escape a sex attack by a schizophrenic resident who had hacked through a wall to assault her . As Cantwell hacked his way through the wall, she realised that the only way to escape was to jump from the window, breaking her spine in the 20ft drop to the ground.

He was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders register for life. Judge . Alan Conrad said that Cantwell ‘submitted a young carer, working on her . own at night, to a violent and terrifying ordeal’ and ordered that the . care home should be investigated for allowing Jemma to work by herself. Now but Miss Rixon has called for more to be done to protect care staff from dangerous residents.

But he hacked his way through the wall to try and continue the assault where she hid . As Cantwell hacked his way through the wall with a chair, she realised that the only way to escape was to jump from the window, breaking her spine in the 20ft drop to the ground . Miss Rixon, from Wirral, Merseyside, said: 'I should never have been left on my own. On that night, I had sole responsibility for six residents - many of whom have mental health problems. It wasn’t safe for me to be the only member of staff on shift. 'Craig tried to rape me, and he almost killed me. I genuinely thought I was going to die. 'I knew I had only one choice: jump out of the window, or stay and be raped - or even worse, killed. 'I should never have been put in that situation.' Miss Rixon had worked as a carer since leaving school, and had been working for the Potens care company for 10 months when she was attacked. Cantwell was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court for nine years in April this year . Just hours into her night shift, she was confronted by Cantwell, who had been setting off the building’s fire alarms and disrupting other residents. When he claimed to have a headache, Miss Rixon took him upstairs to the medicine room. Whilst she was filling out the paperwork, Cantwell locked the door and barricaded himself and Ms Rixon inside. She said: 'I tried not to show that I was scared and attempted to talk him round by saying that we could go back downstairs for a cup of tea. 'Suddenly, he lunged towards me, telling me to get in the bathroom and bend over. He said he was going to kill me and called me a whore. 'I was absolutely terrified, but before I had time to do anything, he flung me across the room and started punching me. 'I scratched at his neck to fight him off, and then I ran into the bathroom and locked myself in. 'I thought I was safe, but as I tried to call the police, he started bashing his way through the wall using a chair.' She said: 'It was a 20ft drop, but I didn’t have a choice. Either I jumped out of the window, or I waited to see what Craig had in store for me.' Landing on her back, Miss Rixon was temporarily paralysed and crawled to safety, where she was rescued by two milkmen and rushed to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Doctors told her that she had broken two vertebrae and fractured her neck and foot. She stayed in hospital for two weeks, and had to use a back brace and wheelchair until she regained the ability to walk again. Her parents Lorraine, 42, and Robert, 45, were on hand to help - along with her boyfriend, factory worker, Ste Rutter, 27. But Miss Rixon says the mental effects of the attack have been harder to recover from. She said: 'I had terrible nightmares about the attack, and woke up screaming. 'Diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, I had to go to counselling and take antidepressants. Now but Ms Rixon has called for more to be done to protect care staff from dangerous residents . 'I was terrified of everyone and everything.' Now hoping to raise awareness for other care workers, Ms Rixon said: 'I went into this job because I love to help people. But my kindness nearly killed me. 'I just hope that other care homes see this and realise how dangerous it is for homes to let people work alone. 'Measures need to be put in place to protect people from going through what I went through. 'I’m lucky to still be alive.' A spokesman for the care home said: 'Potensial Ltd regrets this unforeseen and extremely unfortunate incident. 'Ms Rixon remains as an employee of the company, and we will continue in our commitment to support her recuperation.'","Jemma Rixon, 20, was attacked by schizophrenic resident, Craig .

"Max Clifford was jailed for eight years at Southwark Crown Court in May after a jury found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage girls and young women between 1977 and 1984 . Disgraced PR guru Max Clifford has launched an appeal against his eight-year prison sentence for a string of indecent assaults on four women. In April he became the first person to be convicted under the high profile Operation Yewtree sex crime investigation. He was jailed for eight years at Southwark Crown Court in May after a jury found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage girls and young women between 1977 and 1984. The judge said that if the offences had taken place today – since sentencing guidelines were toughened in 2003 – Clifford would have been regarded as a multiple rapist for which he would have been locked up for life. The maximum sentence for indecent assault at the time was two years. The 71-year-old committed the offences after luring and 'degrading' women through his celebrity connections during his high-profile career. Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court in May, Judge Anthony Leonard told Clifford his personality and position in the public eye were the reasons his crimes were not revealed earlier. He said: 'The reason why they were not brought to light sooner was because of your own dominant character and your position in the world of entertainment which meant that your victims thought that you were untouchable, something that I think you too believed. 'These offences may have taken place a long time ago, when inappropriate and trivial sexual behaviour was more likely to be tolerated, but your offending was not trivial, but of a very serious nature.' For Clifford’s eight offences, the judge gave him a series of sentences of 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, six months, 21 months and 15 months, some to run concurrently and some consecutively, to arrive at a total of eight years. He is now serving his sentence at Category C Littlehey jail in Cambridgeshire. A spokesman for the Judicial Office said Clifford was appealing against the length of his imprisonment which would be heard at the Court of Appeal in London on October 9. The former celebrity agent, who branded his accusers 'fantasists', remained defiant ahead of his sentencing, and said: 'I stand by everything I have said in the last 17 months.' In August, Clifford, pictured kissing a guest on the cheek, was allowed out of prison to attend his brother Bernard's funeral at North East Surrey Crematorium in south west London .

"The Cameroonian military has claimed it has killed Abubekar Shekau, the leader of Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram - the second time his death has been announced in a week. Cameroonian army officers have claimed they killed the terrorist chief in a fierce battle that ended with them pursuing militants over the border into Nigeria. They released a gruesome photo showing what appeared to be Shekau's dead body. But Nigerian officials dismissed the claim that the said Shekau was killed by Cameroonian soldiers inside Nigeria. Scroll down for video . Dead? Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, whose death has been reported twice in four days . Security forces have claimed to have killed Shekau dozens of times since he rose to the top of Boko Haram in 2010. Nigeria's armed forces had only last claimed to have killed him last Wednesday. Shekau reportedly uses body doubles to confound his enemies and, although the man in the photo bears a strong resemblance to him, there has been no independent confirmation that Cameroon's forces have got the right person. Boko Haram and its leader became infamous across the world after it abducted 200 young schoolgirls from their dormitory in north-east Nigera earlier this year. Shekau appeared in a video with the girls, where he threatened to sell them off into slavery. Cameroon has made no official announcement that its soldiers have killed the Boko Haram leader, but several army officers told local media by telephone they had made significant gains in fighting the group. 'Last night fighting was exceedingly violent. It even happened that our troops had to fight beyond our borders,' one anonymous senior officer told Agence Presse Africaine. It seems the reported killing of Shekau came after a Cameroonian soldiers responded to a cross-border attack by Boko Haram militants in the remote north of Cameroon which began at the end of last week. Boko Haram has made several incursions into the hilly jungle region of neighbouring Cameroon in recent months. Cameroon has deployed troops to the border in an attempt to repel them. The militants launched their first assault in the early evening on Thursday in the village of Assighassia near the city of Mokolo. Captives: Some of the 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram from their school earlier this year . Cameroon's army responded, and two of the militants were killed and a Cameroonian soldier injured, state-run Cameroon Radio Television reported late on Friday. 'Two hours later, the terrorist group again attacked the village of Ganse, also close to Mokolo, and killed four civilians,' the report said. More than 40,000 people have fled to Cameroon to escape Boko Haram attacks in northern Nigeria, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, leaving behind few but the elderly and the disabled in their villages across the border. But once over the border they are still not safe and UNHCR is seeking to transfer many of them to a refugee camp further from the frontier at Minawao. Foncha Ngeh, a businessman based in Cameroon's northern hub of Maroua, said that hundreds of people were fleeing from isolated border villages in Cameroon to bigger towns and cities in search of safety. Boko Haram have killed hundreds of people this year, mostly in northeastern Nigeria, although they have launched attacks across the country.","Cameroonian soldiers report chasing militants over the border into Nigeria .

"A financial services CEO worth $70 million told the Daily Show on Tuesday that he opposes the minimum wage because workers are simply 'worth what they're worth.'

'If we eliminated the minimum wage law then individuals would be free to accept jobs at whatever pay they're able to get,' said the millionaire Beverly Hills High School alum. Schiff has made his outrage over minimum wage laws know before. Last month, he posted a video online in which he protested Wal-Mart workers who were demonstrating outside a store as part of a campaign that would raise the retail giant's--and largest employer in America's--hourly wage. 'Would you contribute 15 percent of the price of that TV for the Wal-Mart workers?' he shouted at a man carrying a TV out of the store. 'They are counting on you to pay higher prices!' 'You're worth what you're worth': The outspoken libertarian says that not everyone is created equal and it all just boils down to supply and demand. Besides, he said of fast food workers, 'they don¿t seem desperate and hungry to me' The workers were part of a group fighting to get full-time Wal-Mart workers paid just $25,000 per year. The U.C. Berkeley grad, who's father Irwin Schiff is serving a 13 year prison term for tax evasion, made it clear on Tuesday's Daily Show that he believes that workers are too often painted as hapless underdogs. 'They don’t seem desperate and hungry to me,' he said of fast food workers after admitting he never really eats at such chains.

"Arsene Wenger lamented Arsenal's weak mentality and poor defending as the Gunners threw away a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 with Anderlecht in the Champions League. Arsenal led 2-0 at half-time thanks to Mikel Arteta's penalty and Alexis Sanchez's stunning volley before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain looked to have sealed the win with a third before the hour. There was late drama, however, as Anthony Vanden Borre scored twice - the second another spot-kick - and Aleksandar Mitrovic headed in a 90th-minute equaliser to snatch a dramatic point for the Belgians. Nacho Monreal, Lukas Podolski and Tomas Rosicky (left to right) trudge off after Arsenal threw away a three-goal lead at the Emirates to draw 3-3 with Anderlecht on Tuesday in the Champions League . Aleksandar Mitrovic scored a 90th minute equaliser to break Arsenal hearts and steal a point for his side . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger slammed his side for their weak 'mental level' against Anderlecht . 'Maybe we underestimated them subconsciously and we got punished - in the Champions League you need to be at the right mental level and we got punished because we were not,' Wenger said. 'You have to give them credit - they tried until the end. 'We had a poor defensive performance from the first minute to the 90th today. 'We were also punished because of bad luck - the first goal was clearly offside - but defensively our performance was not good enough. We thought the job was done.' Arsenal's misery was compounded by the sight of Arteta hobbling off in the second half with what Wenger revealed is a hamstring injury. Santi Cazorla attempts to help Alexis Sanchez of the turf  after the comeback from Anderlecht . The Gunners remain in a strong position to qualify from Group D but their chances of finishing top of the pool are slim with Dortmund now five points clear. Wenger's side have gone through second in three out of their last four European campaigns and have lost in the last 16 on each occasion. 'We dropped off too much in the second half and didn't go into the challenges any more - then you are always open,' Wenger continued. 'We stopped winning the challenges and dropped off. We didn't stop the crosses, we didn't stop the long balls. Mitrovic beats Per Mertesacker to a near-post header to complete the most unlikely of comebacks . 'In the first half we were outnumbered sometimes but in the second half it was bad defending.' Anderlecht exacted sweet revenge for Arsenal's victory in the reverse fixture a fortnight ago, when the Gunners scored twice in the last three minutes to win 2-1. The young Belgian outfit were a threat on the break throughout the contest and Wenger admits he was impressed with his opponents. 'Anderlecht are a good team,' Wenger said. 'Maybe in four or five years we will see this team was full of good players and they are much better than everyone thinks they are.' 'Even in the first half they had three or four good chances - they are a good side.' Arsenal face Dortmund at home next before their final group match away to Galatasaray.

"Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa blasted the club's president Vincent Labrune for not consulting him during the transfer window. The 59-year-old claimed he did not even know the club was signing Brazilian defender Doria until he arrived for his medical and revealed that none of his actual transfer targets had been acquired. Bielsa, who has managed Argentina and Chile, has taken charge of Marseille in four matches since joining this summer. Disaster: Marcelo Bielsa claimed none of his transfer targets were acquired despite promises from the club . Bielsa said he did not get the right players during last month's transfer window - with midfielder Benjamin Stambouli joining  Tottenham instead - and that he was not even interested in 19-year-old centre half Doria, who joined on deadline day Monday from Botafogo. 'The outcome of the transfer market is negative,' Biesla said. 'The president made promises that he knew he couldn't keep. 'None of the players joined with my approval. I proposed 12 and none of them came. We wanted Stambouli or (Toby) Alderweireld.' Targets: Bielsa wanted to sign Toby Alderweireld (left) and Benjamin Stambouli (right) but got neither . Bielsa wanted to keep Brazilian center half Lucas Mendes, who joined Qatari club El Jaish. 'I found out that we had sold Lucas Mendes at the last minute because he was leaving for Qatar. I found out about the Doria signing on Monday afternoon when he was arriving for his medical. I opposed it,' Bielsa said. 'The president also promised me we wouldn't sign foreign players, because Marseille doesn't have enough of a structure in place to judge the qualities of someone who isn't playing in France.' Bielsa added that 'the way the club is run disappoints me,' and tensions are likely to be high when training resumes following the international break.

"Gunmen stormed a higher education college in northern Nigeria on Wednesday, firing on fleeing students and setting off an explosion in an attack that killed at least 15 people and wounded 35, police said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack in the region's main city of Kano, but the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which has repeatedly targeted civilians in the north, is likely to be a prime suspect. A police spokesman added that officers arrived on the scene and killed two of the attackers. Scroll down for video . Terrorists stormed the Federal College of Education in Kano, northern Nigeria, killing 15 and injuring 35 . Workers collected the personal effects of students who fled from the attackers who struck earlier today . He said: 'We heard several shots from the gate area and after a few minutes we heard an explosion at the theatre,' said Sanusi Umar, who lectures in English at the federal government college and watched the attack from a neighbouring building. 'The attackers were wearing suits and were running and shooting everywhere.' Insurgents from Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western education is forbidden', are fighting to carve out an Islamic state in Nigeria. Western-style schools are a prime target for their attacks, which include several secondary school massacres and the abduction of 200 school girls in April from the village of Chibok. By contrast, schools teaching Islamic doctrines have been left alone. Heavily armed police secured the area after the attack believed to have been carried out by Boko Haram . Police Commissioner Aderlere Shinaba confirmed one terrorist was shot dead by his men and a second died after he detonated a suicide vest as security forces attempted to retake the compound after the attack . The Kano area of northern Nigeria has been repeated attacked by Boko Haram in recent months . Since a military offensive began last year, the Islamists have taken out their anger on civilians in increasingly frequent attacks. They have also branched out to strike in areas far from the rebel strongholds. At least 82 people were killed in July in a double suicide bombing in the north Nigerian city of Kaduna in July. The group's leader Abubakar Shekau proclaimed a 'Muslim territory' in the northeast after seizing Gwoza near the border with Cameroon, to the east, last month. President Goodluck Jonathan's administration and the armed forces face mounting criticism that they are failing in the war to counter Boko Haram. Jonathan in a statement called the Kano raid a 'dastardly attack', adding that 'the government continues to do all within its powers to further enhance the ability of ... security agencies to prosecute the war against terrorism to a successful conclusion and provide greater security ... across the country.'","Islamic terror group Boko Haram is believed to have been behind the attack .

"A man who matches the description of Lena Dunham's alleged rapist has set up a legal fund to defend his reputation and prepare for a law suit against the Girls creator, a report claims. Ms Dunham, 28, dedicates a chapter of her book, Not That Kind Of Girl, to a 'flamboyant Republican conservative' that she met at Oberlin College in Ohio identified as 'Barry', who she claims raped her after a party. Subsequent reports found a man named Barry One fits the description. After numerous failed attempts to get Ms Dunham to remove the passage or openly clear his name, One's attorney Aaron Minc reveals a fund has been set up to gather costs to defend his reputation. Scroll down for video . Rape claims: In her memoir Not That Kind of Girl, Lena Dunham (seen here in New York on December 2) alleges she was raped in college. A new media investigation claims there is no proof of the man she describes . Minc told Breitbart: 'All proceeds will be spent by Barry on legal costs and related fees associated with defending Barry's reputation including, but not limited to, potentially pursuing Lena Dunham and Penguin Random House for harm caused to Barry's reputation from the publication and sale of Ms Dunham's memoir.' In Ms Dunham's memoir - for which she received a reported $3.7 million advance - the writer claims she drank alcohol then took Xanax and cocaine before inviting Barry back to her on-campus apartment. But the encounter, she claims, quickly turned aggressive, and Barry twice removed the condom during intercourse without telling her. 'I never gave permission to be rough, to stick himself inside me without a barrier between us,' she wrote. 'I never gave him permission. In my deepest self I know this, and the knowledge of it has kept me from sinking.' Dunham's description of Barry is similarly explicit, explaining him as a 'mustachioed campus Republican' with a 'mustache that rode the line between ironic Williamsburg fashion and big buck hunter', who hosted a radio show called Real Talk With Jimbo, worked in the library stacking shelves and 'wore purple cowboy boots'. She also said that he once punched a girl 'in the boob' at a party and, following a consensual sexual encounter, another girl woke to find blood spattered all over the wall 'like a crime scene'. Scene: It is believed the rape Dunham describes in her book took place at Oberlin College in Ohio (pictured) in the winter of 2005 following a party . Furthermore Dunham does not state that 'Barry' is a pseudonym, as she does with other names that appear in her book. Although a Breitbart investigation found the character to be a 'ghost', articles by the Washington Post and Power Line supported One's claim that he has a solid libel case against Ms Dunham. In a statement, Barry One's attorney said he has already spent two months worth of legal fees defending himself. He has been in contact with Ms Dunham's team since October 6 but 'despite multiple requests,' the statement says, 'Lena Dunham has not issued any sort of statement clearing Barry's name and clarifying the confusion that is happening.' Any proceeds not used on legal related costs, Minc said, will be donated to not-for-profit organizations that assist victims of rape and sexual assault, to be selected at a later date. An investigation by John Nolte from Breitbart News undertaken at the Oberlin campus, which was published Thursday, concluded that the 'Barry' Dunham describes is a 'ghost', and that no such person appeared to exist at the college during the years she studied there. 'In fact, we could not find anyone who remembered any Oberlin Republican who matched Dunham's colorful description,' Nolte wrote. 'Under scrutiny, Dunham's rape story didn't just fall apart, it evaporated into pixie dust and blew away.' The Breitbart report followed an attack on Dunham by The National Review's hard-right columnist Kevin Williamson, who said she was 'grossly irresponsible' for publishing the rape claim in the first place. Williamson said he spoke to a Barry who was a prominent Republican that attended Oberlin and that has been hounded by the media since the release of Not That Kind Of Girl in September. This Barry told Williamson he has never met Dunham and did not have any kind of relationship with her. He said the fact his name is Barry and that he is a Republican who went to Oberlin is 'the 'most unfortunate coincidence of my life'. The man, who is married with kids, said he is petrified that his full name is going to be published. Williamson then wrote of Dunham: 'It is at the very least the deployment of weaponized celebrity without any concern for collateral damage. 'I have my doubts about whether the encounter Dunham describes actually happened at all; in her memoir, she writes about presenting anecdotes from other people's lives as her own. 'But, for the record, the man to whom I spoke does not believe that Dunham intended to refer to him.' The Breitbart investigation, which describes Dunham as 'one of the most powerful and influential women in America', included the account of Williamson's 'Barry'. It notes that friends of his laughed at the suggestion of him ever having a moustache and that other details given by Dunham also didn't fit. Nolte then goes in search of someone else that might fit the description. He deduces the alleged rape occurred in winter 2005. Massive publicity tour:  Lena Dunham meets fans and signs copies of her book 'Not That Kind Of Girl' at Waterstones in London on October 29, 2014 . A search of the campus newspaper archives and Oberlin College graduation announcements did not find any Barry - other than the one Williamson spoke to - who graduated or attended Oberlin College in 2005, 2006, or 2007. A further search of the campus for someone not named Barry but who fits the description given by Dunham also showed no results. There was no proof of a radio show called Real Talk With Jimbo, he said. 'Nevertheless, no amount of digging could verify even a single detail of Dunham's rape claim,' Nolte wrote. The report criticizes Dunham for pointing the finger at this one Barry in such a public manner, as opposed to reporting what happened to her to the authorities. Dunham has not responded to the Brietbart News piece. Calls to Random House, the publisher of Not That Kind Of Girl, and to Dunham's literary agent made by MailOnline were not immediately returned on Thursday. Dunham did however react to Williamson when his piece was published last month. She took to Twitter to defend her story. Love: Dunham is seen here at the 2014 Golden Globes with her boyfriend, musician Jack Antonoff . 'Some men are enraged by stories of sexual assault that don't have clear cut villains, pimps or men with guns,' she wrote. 'That's because these stories force them to ask hard questions about their history with consent. 'Well, we all have to ask hard questions. Grow the f--- up. 'And I have some news for certain 'news' outlets. No matter how much you thump your keyboards with your meat hands we will not stop talking.' This is not the only controversy to come from Dunham's tome. The New York native cancelled several appearances on her book tour after being accused of molesting her younger sister as a child. In one chapter of the book she describes how, as a seven-year-old, she experimented with her sister Grace, who was one at the time. 'One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the better of me,' Dunham wrote. 'Grace was sitting up, babbling smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina.' The accusations were mostly spearheaded by Williamson, who said her behavior was child abuse. Dunham came back swinging, writing on Twitter: 'The right wing news story that I molested my little sister isn't just LOL- it's really f---ing upsetting and disgusting. Family: Dunham was accused of molesting her younger sister Grace (pictured) by two media outlets following a controversial chapter in her book, where she admits to experiment with her sibling as a child . 'And by the way, if you were a little kid and never looked at another little kid's vagina, well, congrats to you. 'Usually this is stuff I can ignore but don't demean sufferers, don't twist my words, . 'I told a story about being a weird 7 year old. I bet you have some too, old men, that I'd rather not hear.

"The goalkeeper who has been outwitted throughout the afternoon by a child with a pack of cards is discussing tricks of the mind. He hopes they might just stop the Premier League’s bigger kids from bullying Tottenham so mercilessly. ‘Confidence’ is Hugo Lloris’s buzzword, a term he often comes back to when discussing Tottenham’s status and where they want to be. That destination is the Champions League. It was the missed target that cost Tim Sherwood his job despite his ‘great’ work last season; it might cost the club Lloris next summer if they fail again to reach the top four. Hugo Lloris has been superb for Tottenham since joining in 2012 but the club has struggled in that period . Spurs' mediocre start to the season got worse on Sunday with a 1-0 home defeat against West Brom . But that little step is also a major psychological leap, a progression that requires Spurs to displace one of the clubs that routinely slaps them around. They play Arsenal tomorrow, having taken one point from nine games against Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal in the past year. In those extraordinary games, overseen by three managers, they have scored twice and conceded 30. When asked if points must now count double for Spurs in games against their top-four rivals, Lloris replies: ‘Yes. But we are in the Premier League and it is the most difficult league to win in the world. There are five, six, seven top clubs which are able to win, or are at the same level as the champions in France, Italy, Germany.’ Lloris says his team-mates must overcome the mental block that sometimes affects them in the big games . Last month Spurs were battered 3-0 at home against Liverpool. Manager Mauricio Pochettino responded with an angry debrief and an analysis session that saw him re-watch the tape 20 times. ‘What happened in the changing room stays in there,’ says Lloris in a lounge at White Hart Lane. He has been warmly hosting young survivors of brain tumours as part of the NHS’s Get to Know Cancer campaign, one of whom has been tricking him with cards. Lloris’s poker face slips as he says: ‘Of course, when you get bad results the manager’s job is to say the truth to the players.’ Liverpool comprehensively beat Tottenham 3-0 at White Hart Lane earlier in the season . The cold truth, in Lloris’s mind, is that not enough of Pochettino’s squad have the mindset of winners. Their challenge, he says, is to change that psyche while assimilating new players and a new manager and also meeting the club’s targets. ‘I think we need time,’ Lloris says. ‘We are trying to go that way. I think it is important that there is confidence between players and manager and staff and we are still learning and trying to improve. ‘I am sure we will be ready in a few months. But it is strange to say we will be ready in a few months because we need to get points very quickly because the season has started and we have ambition and we need the most points possible. The French keeper has been impressed with new manager Mauricio Pochettino who took over this summer . ‘When you go into a club, the first thing (you find) is tradition. This is the difference between the top clubs in Europe and Tottenham. They are used to winning so when you are a new player in that club, in the changing room there are a lot of players who won a lot of titles. For that, we need to start with one trophy. ‘It (confidence) happens when you win and in the big games you win as well. But there is not only a league between top teams — you can lose points everywhere.’ There was too much of that last season, as Tottenham went from finishing fifth in 2012-13 — one point behind fourth-placed Arsenal — to sixth in 2013-14, 10 points behind Arsene Wenger’s side. Lloris says: ‘It was a difficult season. For me it was the first time a manager was sacked during the season. ‘Tim Sherwood did a great job. It was not easy for him, but he did it with passion for the club and he did well because you don’t have time to put your project (in place). The season had started (when he came in for Andre Villas Boas) and you have to find the right solution.’ Spurs lost three times to North London rivals Arsenal last season, and they face them again on Saturday . The solution for Tottenham was Pochettino. Lloris — the 27-year-old son of a Monte Carlo banker and whose late mother was a lawyer — was growing up in France when he first heard of the man who now manages him ‘I watched him playing for PSG and Bordeaux, and for Argentina in the 2002 World Cup,’ he says. ‘In PSG he was captain, at Bordeaux too. He is a leader. ‘He has this attitude every day. He is a young manager but he doesn’t show it. He is very clear in his speaking. He has a presence and a proper concept of football. He has a philosophy. Lloris said Tim Sherwood did a 'great' job last season, but it was not enough to get Spurs into the top four . ‘The atmosphere is great. We are hungry, we want to improve, and we want to get better. We are just at the beginning. We have a lot to improve and show it as a team. But I think we can see the progress.’ Perhaps, but as yet results have been modest. Lloris signed a five-year deal in July, but as one of the best goalkeepers in the world he will again be a target next summer if Tottenham can’t meet their target and, therefore, fail to give him Champions League football. Lloris speaks to fans at the ‘Get to know cancer’ event at White Hart Lane . Lloris and Younes Kaboul show some fans around the Spurs dressing room at the ‘Get to know cancer’ event . Asked if his future is dependent on that, he says: ‘I don’t know. I’m not thinking about that. I am just focused on my work and the club and I hope we can have a good reward at the end of the season. But nobody knows about the future of the club. Of course, it is a big motivation to be back in the Champions League with Tottenham.’ A win over Arsenal and the setting of a new trend against the division’s bully boys will help greatly. *Hugo Lloris was speaking as part of Tottenham’s ongoing support for the Get to know cancer campaign, that aims to raise awareness of cancer and promote early diagnosis amongst the club’s fans. This month, the focus is on raising awareness of brain tumours amongst young people, working in partnership with HeadSmart.","Hugo Lloris admits Tottenham need to be stronger in the big games .

"I spent the World Cup in the same Rio de Janeiro hotel as Louis van Gaal and some of his backroom staff and, in conversations with him, it was clear he was going from Brazil straight into managing Manchester United without a break. I thought at the time that leaving behind a highly pressurised World Cup and immediately taking over at one of the biggest clubs in the world would be quite difficult to handle. Ideally, you would want to begin such a demanding job feeling refreshed after a break. Since then, with a staggering number of injuries to cope with, life just hasn’t got any easier for Van Gaal. And this means results in the opening third of the season were below par and almost certainly failed to meet his expectations. VIDEO Scroll down to see Louis van Gaal talk ahead of United's clash with Southampton . Louis van Gaal's decision to take charge of United directly after the World Cup may not have been so wise . The Dutch manager oversees training at the club's Aon Training Complex on Friday . United players are put through their paces ahead of their Premier League clash with Southampton on Monday . In some ways it is extraordinary that United are still fourth in the table this morning. The first half-hour at Arsenal last month was as bad as I’ve ever seen them play; worse than their performances under David Moyes last season. I was travelling for the rest of the game and I was unable to see it live so I was stunned when I heard they had won. But if you can describe the position they are now in as par for the course — and up until this point they were definitely a few shots over — I would say that they still have some tough holes ahead and are capable of dropping some shots. The problem for United is no matter how formidable the attacking threat, everyone feels that they have a chance against them because of their defensive weakness. Certainly Southampton will on Monday. Ronald Koeman’s team are not just ahead of United in the league — they are ahead of them in terms of knowing what their first-choice XI is, what their tactics are and how they are going to approach the game. They, too, had an extremely difficult summer but they have settled into their new identity much quicker than United. United players celebrate beating Arsenal, despite one of their worst performances of the season . United have suffered a succession of injuries this campaign, with record signing Angel di Maria currently out . While United have struggled, Southampton have exceeded expectations under Ronald Koeman . There is a growing assumption that United will now make the top four, which probably was the key target for the club after dipping to seventh place last season, an unprecedented low in the modern era. My feeling is that it will still be very much nip and tuck for them at the end of this campaign; that they may well make the cut but they will just squeeze over the line rather than make it comfortably. In defence of Van Gaal, you have to allow for the extraordinary injury list with which he has had to cope. At different times he has lost Jonny Evans, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind and Luke Shaw for significant periods. Even if he had his first-choice back four, we all would have pointed to the defence as a potential weakness. Being denied his best players and with constant chopping and changing, it is hardly surprising they have struggled in that area. David de Gea has had a really good start to the season but the reality is he has been overworked for a Manchester United goalkeeper. The side really should not be relying on him to keep them in games. Although United have been scoring goals, they have struggled with a constantly changing rearguard . Keeper David de Gea has been arguably United's best player with a string of match-saving displays . The Red Devils have been linked with another big money spending spree to turn them back into champions . I see now there are reports they plan to spend another £100 million in the transfer market. If they are to, then you would imagine that Van Gaal’s first priority would be to solidify the defence. Mats Hummels has been mentioned but for me he is ball-playing centre-half. I really like him, but I’m not sure that he is the player United really need. For me, they require a stopper in the mould of Nemanja Vidic; someone whose first priority is to defend. Atletico Madrid’s Diego Godin, another name mentioned, is more suited to that role. If you wanted to look at the positives for United, they have at least rediscovered some of their panache compared with last season. When they are in full flow, they are a joy to watch. Wayne Rooney is firing, Robin van Persie showed signs last weekend of getting his form back and Angel di Maria has been superb and they will miss him while he is injured. Robin van Persie has started to show the sort of form that brought United the title in his debut season . Wayne Rooney has responded to being handed the captaincy with some consistent performances . Radamel Falcao is the third member of United's new Holy Trinity, but doubts remain over his fitness . If Radamel Falcao can show some fitness, with Adnan Januzaj and Juan Mata to add, Marouane Fellaini showing some form and James Wilson some promise, then they are back to what you imagine a United side to be, with attacking football at its core. Yet despite that club tradition, United have always built on a strong defensive foundation, too. Gary Pallister and Steve Bruce, Vidic and Rio Ferdinand are as much a part of United’s folklore as their great attacking players. Until Van Gaal can rebuild a defensive force like that, United will struggle to challenge for the Premier League title. And if he cannot put things right quickly this season, then the top four could still be beyond them. United have not successfully managed to replace Rio Ferdinand (left) and Nemanja Vidic at the back . United should be looking to bring in world class defenders like Mats Hummels (left) and Diego Godin (right) RODGERS HANDLING OF GERRARD IS SPOT ON . When I saw Steven Gerrard had been left out last weekend by Brendan Rodgers, I thought it was great management. Some people would say he was dropped; I would say he was rested. When you leave out a player such as Gerrard, it’s always going to create a great fuss but the reality is that he has to manage his games these days. And there’s another point that hasn’t been considered. Liverpool have lost Luis Suarez to Barcelona, Daniel Sturridge to injury and Mario Balotelli hasn’t worked out. So Rodgers needs to find another attacking threat from somewhere. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has been rested by Brendan Rodgers in recent weeks . Rodgers has made the right call in resting Gerrard, especially before Liverpool's midweek clash with Basle . That means he needs to get Steven playing further forward again and, if he’s going to get in and around the box, as he has been doing in recent games, he’ll need even more energy than before. Playing the holding role is a doddle by comparison — you can play there until you’re 40! That’s why choosing his games during this busy time is vital and I would imagine the manager and the captain would have planned when and where he plays. He’ll definitely be needed for what promises to be a dramatic night on Tuesday against Basel, when Rodgers’ decision to rest Gerrard and others against Real may be vindicated if Liverpool qualify. And with games against Manchester United and Arsenal in the next two weeks followed by the Christmas period, Rodgers needs a fit and fresh Gerrard to get him some goals. The failure of Mario Balotelli at Anfield means Liverpool will need to use Gerrard's talents further forward . FINALLY, OWNERS GET THE POINT . Sunday is a landmark. We are 16 weeks into the season and still no Premier League manager has been sacked. That has not happened for 18 years and, if we get to February 16, it will be a Premier League record for managers’ longevity and stability. You hope this starts a trend. I’d like to think that owners are resisting the early panic sacking, eight games into the season, when it’s always too soon to make a judgment. In fact, I would advocate having transfer windows for managers, so you have to stick with the coaching staff you appoint at the beginning of the season and can’t make a change until January. For this season at least, it seems owners have grasped the point. Let’s hope it continues. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew is still in a job, despite fans' unrest earlier in the season . Pardew has since taken the Magpies up to seventh after inflicting a first defeat on Chelsea this season .","Manchester United have failed to live up to expectations again this season .

A spokesman for Veet said the adverts, which have only been aired in North America, were not intended to offend, but that the company has decided to axe the campaign. She said: 'While the current advertising campaign for VEET running in the USA has been well received by most consumers who appreciate its wacky, tongue in cheek humour, it has also provoked a great deal of comment. 'We take our responsibilities very seriously and the ad was carefully reviewed before it aired.  However we are very concerned by any misinterpretation of its tone or meaning, and in the light of the feedback received we have decided to withdraw it. 'We would also like to apologise for any offense it may have caused. That was certainly not our intention.' The Veet ads call to mind vintage commercials that suggested women should use products like deodorant for the sole purpose of attracting men. Indeed, deodorant was not widely used until around 1919, when James Young, a copywriter for Odorono - one of the original brands of deodorant - created an ad that changed attitudes to sweating and body odor. Until then, the public did not see the need for deodorant, since underarm sweat was not viewed as a social faux pas. In fact, it was commonly believed that blocking perspiration was unhealthy. So in his copy, he presented 'excessive perspiration' as a source of embarrassment: . A woman’s arm! Poets have sung of its grace; artists have painted its beauty. It should be the daintiest, sweetest thing in the world. And yet, unfortunately, it isn’t always. Many a woman who says, ‘No, I am never annoyed by perspiration,’ does not know the facts – does not realize how much sweeter and daintier she would be if she were entirely free from it.","Criticism has poured in since the ads first aired on Monday during Dancing with the Stars, with viewers branding them 'sexist', 'asinine' and 'wrong'

"After the week he’s had, it might come as some consolation to Danny Welbeck that he will not be the only one under the microscope at the Emirates on Saturday lunchtime. A two-goal hero for England but too average for Manchester United, it is perhaps inevitable that Arsenal’s new £16million signing makes his debut in one of the biggest games of the season so far. If this was a transfer few would have predicted at the start of the summer, what about Frank Lampard pitching up at Manchester City? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Everything you need to know about Arsenal vs Manchester City . Danny Welbeck is set to make his Arsenal debut against Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime .

The former Chelsea midfielder is ready to make his debut for the Barclays Premier League champions, according to Manuel Pellegrini, while Eliaquim Mangala - the most expensive defender in the history of British football at £32m - is also expected to be part of the squad. With Joe Hart coming under scrutiny, not to mention increasing pressure from his deputy Willy Caballero, and Bacary Sagna returning to Arsenal for the first time since signing off with victory in last season’s FA Cup final, there are certainly plenty of storylines. ‘Look, they got Sagna,’ said Arsene Wenger, who had previously questioned whether the Frenchman had been the subject of an illegal approach from Saturday’s opponents. ‘I am sorry he left us because I absolutely tried to keep him. He was a very good player and could cover us in central defence. We lost him. He could have gone even if Manchester City did not exist. He could have gone somewhere, Italy, anywhere.’ Frank Lampard is ready to make his debut for Manchester City after joining from Chelsea this summer . Former Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna will return to the Emirates Stadium on Saturday . What kind of a reception will he get? ‘A good one,’ replied the Arsenal manager. Wenger has every reason to approach the early kick-off with some trepidation. In three of their 12.45pm kick-offs last season, Arsenal were beaten 6-3 by City, 5-1 by Liverpool and 6-0 by Chelsea. It would be enough to scar any player psychologically, but Wenger insists the timings were not to blame. ‘I never honestly thought it was the kick-off time that cost us the games,’ he said. ‘It was the performances. The poor performance was not linked with the kick-off times. ‘We live in a society where you need to find explanations for everything. Let’s not forget we are competitive people and sometimes when your opponent is better than you, you lose. It wouldn’t matter if we played at 9pm at night or 12.45pm, they were better than us. ‘That was not, in my opinion, down to the kick-off time. Let’s not make a psychological problem of it. What is very difficult psychologically is to lose the games. In my job, the most important thing is always to find the right reasons and I don’t think it was to do with the early kick-off time. ‘I think we were beaten last year because we were not aggressive enough in those games. We were not mobile enough and lost too many challenges. As a unit, we were beaten all over the place. We were 2-0 down after 10 minutes (against both Chelsea and Liverpool). ‘You are in the position then that you have to take a huge gamble to come back and you open yourself up.’ Arsene Wenger insists the timings of last season's kick-off times didn't have an affect on Arsenal's results . Pellegrini was at pains to point out that last season’s thumping win over the Gunners will count for no more than Arsenal’s 3-0 win in the Community Shield last month. ‘Absolutely,’ he said. ‘Different games, different competitions, different moments. Remember that when we played Community Shield we had nine players out of the team because they arrived too late to play.’ This will be City’s first game since allowing Alvaro Negredo to join Valencia on transfer-deadline day, effectively limiting them to three recognised strikers until January at the earliest. One of them, Stevan Jovetic, is currently sidelined with a hamstring strain. Manchester City allowed striker Alvaro Negredo to leave for Valencia on transfer deadline day . The decision to off-load Negredo was, said the City boss, driven by the financial fair play penalty limiting the number of foreign players in his Champions League squad and the player’s desire to return to Spain. So would Pellegrini not have been interested in a young Englishman from across town like Welbeck? He did not dismiss the idea out of hand. ‘At that moment no, because we had Negredo, Dzeko, Aguero and Jovetic - four strikers,’ he said. ‘Now we have one player less but we had less choice and could not spend the money. ‘We’re not only interested in English players, we’re interested in players of all nationalities if they are good players. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini says the club are interested in players of all nationalities . ‘Arsenal are a very strong team with Alexis Sanchez, a very important player, and now with Welbeck.’ Today’s clash marks the start of an important week for both clubs as they both head to Germany for Champions League games, Arsenal to face Borussia Dortmund and City to take on Bayern Munich. For now, though, all eyes are on the Premier League title race. And Welbeck will not be the only one in the spotlight.","Danny Welbeck set to make Arsenal debut against Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime .

"Manuel Neuer is the ultimate 'sweeper-keeper' and now seems to want to spend more time outside his area than inside it. Germany's No 1 could be found nearer the halfway line during Bayern Munich's 0-0 draw with Hamburg on Saturday. As the match neared its conclusion, Neuer came to clear a loose ball but instead of hacking it away he took on not one but two opponents.

Unfortunately for Neuer, the incident happened outside the box, and he received a yellow card . He rounded the first, but came unstuck when a loose touch left him scrambling to reach the ball before the second opposition. He didn't get there in time, and goalkeeping instincts came to the fore as Neuer got down low and stopped the ball with an outstretched arm. Luckily for him and Bayern, he was only given a yellow card, and the match finished 0-0. His reputation as a 'sweeper-keeper' was cemented during the World Cup after his display against Algeria.

"England were short of runs, and appropriate bowling skills, as Kumar Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka to a six-wicket win in the fourth one-day international at the Premadasa Stadium. James Taylor's breakthrough innings of 90, in just his third ODI and first in 15 months, was the major contribution in a patchy 265 all out - stand-in captain Eoin Morgan (62) doing his best too to try to salvage a par total after choosing to bat on a dry pitch. But it did not quite stretch the hosts, Sangakkara (86) sharing a stand of 96 with Mahela Jayawardene and Angelo Mathews finishing the job with an unbeaten 51 - farming an attack surprisingly loaded towards seam rather than spin - to keep Sri Lanka always just ahead of the game. Whereas they used 36 overs of spin, Morgan had only 10 available to him from a frontline slow bowler - and Sangakkara took routine advantage, easing past his third successive half-century and hitting seven fours in all from 105 balls. England were flattered that victory came with only two balls to spare - and from 3-1 down, they must win all the remaining fixtures if they are to somehow start their World Cup winter with a series success. James Taylor came in at No 3 and scored 90, but couldn't prevent England from falling to another defeat .","Kumar Sangakkara scores 86 as Sri Lanka win fourth ODI in Colombo .

"Arsenal’s financial results for the 2013-14 season, published on Friday afternoon, reveal record levels of ‘free’ cash sitting in the club’s bank account, £173.3m at the end of May, much of which should theoretically have been available - and be available - for Arsene Wenger as a transfer kitty. The Gunners spent around £78m over the summer on players including Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck although the net spend was only around £46m. Even allowing for a ‘rainy day’ stockpile that the club’s chief executive Ivan Gazidis, likes to keep in reserve, and even allowing for the fact that some of the cash will be spent on an increased wage bill for summer signings, Wenger should still theoretically have up to £100m available to him for more players - whether in January or next summer. But Sportsmail understands that the Arsenal manager will only have £30m to spend on players in the January transfer window. Arsenal spent heavily on the likes of Alexis Sanchez but could have used around £100m more this summer . Arsenal's signings, Mathieu Debuchy, Calum Chambers, David Ospina, Welbeck and Sanchez cost £78m . Even the most conservative estimate of money available, allowing for a large reserve in case Arsenal fail to reach next season’s Champions League group stages, suggests Wenger had £60m more at his disposal this summer than he spent. Club sources say that Wenger's realistic January spending would be limited to two players in the £10m to £15m price range each, with wages on top. Further spending would be sanctioned in the summer. Arsenal have been linked with several holding midfielders including William Carvalho and Sami Khedira, but price and wages were a sticking point during the summer transfer window. Wenger is also thought to be interested in Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who has been the subject of criticism from fans at the Bernabeu. The Frenchman, a graduate in economics who famously seeks value in the transfer market, has been notoriously reluctant to splash massive sums over the years. Yet the revelation that there is so much money in Arsenal’s bank account, is sure to prompt renewed debate among Gunners supporters over why Wenger is not spending it. The accounts indicate yet again what a successful club Arsenal are, financially speaking, with football club income up to £298.7m from £242.8, driven by a leap in Premier League TV money. Sanchez, signed from Barcelona, has made an impressive start, scoring three times already for Arsenal . The Gunners also purchased Danny Welbeck from Manchester United for £16m on transfer deadline day . Operating profits are up to £62.1 from £25.2m last year. The club’s total wage bill has risen by almost £11m from £154.5m to £166.4m but remains significantly lower than that of Manchester City and Manchester United (both well in excess of £200m now) and Chelsea. Financial analysts within the influential Arsenal Supporters’ Trust group were expecting cash reserves of around £140m so the £173.3m is a surprise - and will only increase the clamour for Wenger to spend it. He ended the Gunners' nine-year long trophy drought by leading his team to FA Cup victory in May but Arsenal have not won the Premier League title since 2004 and last finished as high as second in 2005. Arsenal’s chairman, Sir Chips Keswick, said: ‘Our revenues [including property income] have exceeded £300m, underpinned by TV and the significant progress made on our commercial agenda, and our improved financial position has allowed us to supplement the squad with important new signings. 'Our ambition is to put Arsenal Football Club at the pinnacle of the game here and in Europe. We all want to savour a repeat of the joys of last May.” Welbeck is yet to score a goal for the club despite good chances against Dortmund and Manchester City . Mesut Ozil, whose recent performances have been criticised, is the club's record signing at over £42m . Gazidis, said: ‘The club is in excellent shape, both on and off the pitch. We are proud of our 11th FA Cup success and the reward this represents to our fans in the Arsenal community around the world. 'There is always more to do and, whether investing in the team or in training facilities which will provide long-term benefit to the club, our guiding principles are the same and our focus is clear, on delivering more on field success. 'This remains the shared ambition of our majority shareholder Stan Kroenke, the board and everyone connected with the club. 'We are well placed to deliver against those ambitions.’ Calum Chambers joined Arsenal from Southampton and the 19-year-old is getting plenty of first team action . Mathieu Debuchy's injury has left Arsenal light at the back after they failed to buy enough defenders .","Arsene Wenger spent £78million over the summer on the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck .

"Wayne Rooney has joked that English is now a secondary language in the Manchester United dressing room, with everyone now speaking Spanish. The plethora of foreign imports coming into Old Trafford this summer, including the likes of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera, as well as the ones already at the club such as Juan Mata and David de Gea, has meant Spanish has now taken over as the primary language used at the club. Rooney told Sky Sports: 'You get in the dressing room and everyone's speaking Spanish! English is getting pushed aside a bit. Wayne Rooney is confident Manchester United have now turned the corner and are looking ahead . Rooney goes up to head the ball during Manchester United's game against Leicester on Sunday . Spanish speaking trio Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Marcos Rojo, as well as Robin van Persie, embrace before the game against Leicester on Sunday . 'All the senior players are helping the new lads settle in too and there's a lot of foreign players so they can help each other too. 'The manager makes sure the players are speaking English as well and the club make sure things are put in place for them to adapt to life in England.' The Manchester United and England captain also believes the emphatic victory against QPR last weekend has got the Red Devils back on the right track, with restored belief within the squad they can challenge up towards the top of the league season and bring the glory days back to Old Trafford. 'The victory against QPR has settled everyone down. We're still adapting to the changes but there's a good feeling around the training ground. 'It's different (at Manchester United now from previous years) in terms of the changes which have been implemented in the squad since Sir Alex stepped down as manager. The 28-year-old scores for Manchester United against Swansea in his first game as captain for the Red Devils . Rooney has scored 218 times for the Manchester United, and is now only 31 goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton's goal tally for the club . Rooney, seen here scoring a penalty against Norway, is nine goals away from breaking Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time goal record for England . 'This is especially the case in terms of the players that have come in and left the club at the same time, so we are all adpting to it at the moment and hopefully we can be successful.' Rooney also said he would be disappointed in himself if he failed to break the goalscoring records for both club and country, with the 28-year-old now in sight of both records - both set by United legend Sir Bobby Charlton. Charlton leads the all-time records for United and England with 49 and 249 respectively, with Rooney having netted 218 times for the Red Devils and 41 for the Three Lions. He added: 'I feel I should get both goalscoring records for England and Manchester United with the age I am now and how close I am to breaking the records. 'I feel as though I've got a lot of football left in me at the top level so I'd be disappointed if I didn't break both of them.'

"Arsene Wenger insists Jack Wilshere silenced his critics by inspiring Arsenal's fightback against Manchester City. Former England and Manchester United star Paul Scholes has been the most outspoken in questioning why Wilshere's development has stalled since making his debut in 2008. The 22-year-old issued the perfect response against the Barclays Premier League champions, reacting to Sergio Aguero's opener by lobbing Joe Hart before teeing up a sublime volley for Alexis Sanchez. Jack Wilshere has silenced his critics according to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger . Martin Demichelis' late header salvaged a 2-2 draw for City, but it was the dynamic Wilshere who really caught the eye. 'The best place to answer critics is on the pitch,' said Wenger, who was forced to defend the unimpressive Mesut Ozil once again. 'That's what Jack did, but I don't believe we can explain his good performance through the criticism of Paul Scholes. 'But you have to respond to critics when you're in a public job. You have accept criticism, go on the pitch and show you have the talent. 'The most important thing is to go show how good you are. 'Jack finished with his right foot and chipped a goalkeeper who knows him well. I'm very happy with that way he finished. The Arsenal academy product exchanged passes with Mesut Ozil before chipping Joe Hart . 'He looked dangerous in the first half as well because he has found his pace again. I'm very happy.' Debate has raged over Wilshere's best position with Scholes highlighting the uncertainty before Saturday's Emirates Stadium showdown in his role as analyser for BT Sport. But Scholes was greeted by an irrepressible display that argued a watertight case for being involved in the advanced role favoured by Wilshere and Wenger. England coach Roy Hodgson has used him more defensively, but Wenger believes his strengths demand a different approach. 'Jack was always a boy who was at his most dangerous in the final third. That's why I prefer him to play higher up the pitch,' Wenger said. 'One of his qualities is penetrating in the final third, but I'm not against him being defensive. He can do both because he is a good footballer. Jack Wilshere's performanceinspired Arsenal's comeback against Manchester City at The Emirates . 'For a long time he didn't kick the ball well because of his ankle injury. 'The big difference now is that he stays on the feet, whereas before for a while when he was not as confident to push on his ankle he would go down. 'Now he has that solid aspect to the game he had before he was injured.' Wilshere took the diplomatic line by stating he is happy in either midfield role, but his words also made his preference clear. 'Naturally I want to go forward more. In Arsenal's formation it's nice to play forward and in the England one it's different. I'm happy to play either way,' Wilshere said. It was Wilshere's first goal since January and the Arsenal academy product admits he needs to be more prolific. Vincent Kompany said that Arsenal were a better side than last year with 'more quality all over the pitch' 'I want to score more goals and my goalscoring record hasn't been good enough,' Wilshere added. 'In the formation we play I should be scoring more goals. We play with one holding and two going forward and I'm the one who gets forward. 'I've had a few chances already this season and I should be scoring more. Hopefully that will be one of many.' Wilshere highlighted the new found spirit that ensured Arsenal would not fold after slipping a goal behind and City captain Vincent Kompany was impressed by what he saw. 'They have definitely made progress. They are a better side. They have more quality all over the pitch,' Kompany said. 'Obviously they played well but they didn't have too many clear-cut chances. 'They didn't need too many to score twice, which is the sign of a strong team.' VIDEO Wenger applauds 'quality' match .","Jack Wilshere silenced his critics says Gunners boss Arsene Wenger .

The goals sent Stuart Gray’s side into seventh and extended Birmingham’s winless run to five Championship matches. Lee Clarke’s side had started the game with purpose and created an excellent chance within four minutes. David Davis strode forward and whipped a pass to Wes Thomas, who backheeled the ball to a stop on the edge of the area to set up Clayton Donaldson. But he sent his shot high over the bar. Wednesday responded and could have taken the lead had Atdhe Nuhiu volleyed Maguire’s cross on target rather than just wide. It was almost too sweet a connection by the Austrian, already with four goals this campaign. Clarke’s side continued to make most of the running though, producing good openings only to fluff their finishes. Paul Robinson headed David Cotterill’s corner wide and then Cotterill curled a super cross onto the head of Thomas only for the striker to miss badly.

Thomas was then put through by Robinson but Kieren Westwood was out quickly to smoother his finish. Birmingham looked vulnerable on the counter attack however, and within five minutes of the restart twice went close to conceding the opening goal. Jacques Maghoma led a swift breakaway from a Birmingham corner and fed Maguire, who swept a shot from the edge of the area just wide.

Referee James Adcock curiously booked Nuhiu for catching the ball with May down injured – there was to be no Paolo Di Canio-style aggrandisement here – but the 21-year-old picked himself off the turf to claim the decisive goal. The £800,000 summer signing from St Johnstone collected the ball on the wing and with Birmingham’s defence backtracking advanced into the area before finishing confidently past Randolph. It was Wednesday’s first goal in 247 minutes after two games failing to find the net. Birmingham pressed for an equaliser and captain Robinson was denied by a superb block in the six-yard area. But Wednesday made the game certain in the 89th minute when Helan, who had come on for May eight minutes earlier, converted Maguire’s cross with a controlled finish.","Stevie May and Jérémy Hélan scored for the Owls at St Andrews .

"A 25-year-old 'internet sensation' has been imprisoned for five years on child porn charges for persuading 11 underage female fans to send sexually explicit pictures and videos of themselves to him. Michael Lombardo - better known by his YouTube channel name, Mike Lombardo, on which he sings love song ballads on the piano - pleaded guilty in September to the charges, which involved girls aged between 15 and 17. 'Lombardo took advantage of his position as an Internet star, and took advantage of his following of female teenage fans on YouTube,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Tamara Thomson wrote in a sentencing memorandum, according to The Post-Standard. The five-year prison sentence was the minimum U.S. District Judge David Hurd could have imposed, with a maximum of 20 years. Scroll down for video . Michael Lombardo, 25, from upstate New York, abused his position as an 'internet star' to persuade 11 minors to send him sexually explicit photos . Lombardo is also forced to register as a convicted sex offender. Lombardo graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston. He developed a following over YouTube and started communicating with those fans over the Internet and by texting, court papers said. Lombardo was arrested in July 2012 at his home following a seven-month FBI investigation that began after he'd arranged a liaison with a 15-year-old fan from Indiana, according to court documents. In a pre-sentence report, Lombardo told probation officers that while he knows his victims were adversely affected, some of them were thrilled to send him the photos, Thomson wrote in her memorandum. His rationale for his conduct was that he was friendless, so he depended on online relationships, Thomson wrote. Lombardo suffers from 'significant mental and emotional problems', his lawyer, Donald Kinsella, wrote in court papers. Michael Lombardo was sentenced this morning to five years in federal prison for exchanging explicit images with underage female fans . After Lombardo's music became popular on YouTube, he was sought-after for live concerts and internet performances, Kinsella wrote. Lombardo developed a following of fans, 'some of whom became ''groupies'',' Kinsella wrote. But Lombardo was only between 21 and 23-years-old when he committed his crimes, the lawyer wrote. 'In addition, he never posted, disseminated, or shared any of the images or videos that were made during the course of his conduct,' Kinsella wrote. In a September 2010 online conversation with a 16-year-old girl, prosecutors noted that Lombardo was keenly aware that he was violating the law. During that exchange, Lombardo suggested to the girl that she delete chat logs and photos they exchanged since, 'that’s like 5 years in federal prison and sex offender registration'. He added, 'until you’re 18. Lol'. But Lombardo never had sexual contact with an underage victim, Kinsella said. About 80 percent of the female fans Lombardo had cybersex with were older than 17, Kinsella wrote. Prosecutors argued that Lombardo should receive 20 years in prison, the statutory maximum. But his lawyers countered that the mandatory minimum, five years, was appropriate punishment . The Indiana victim traveled with two 17-year-old female friends to Ellicottville, N.Y., to meet Lombardo in December 2011, court papers said. FBI agents, who'd been tipped off about the liaison, interviewed the girls there and all three revealed that Lombardo had enticed them to send sexually explicit videos and pictures, court papers said. The victims said they'd also received sexually explicit images from Lombardo, the papers said. Lombardo estimated that he engaged in cybersex with 'about fifty females and that probably 80% of them were adult', according to The Smoking Gun. As a condition of his plea, Lombardo agreed to forfeit three laptop computers and his smartphone.

"THE billionaire founder of Phones 4u has launched a Twitter tirade against ‘ruthless’ mobile phone networks, accusing them of forcing the company into administration. John Caudwell, who sold the business in 2006, blasted both Vodafone and EE after they ended contracts to supply handsets through the chain’s 550 stores. But Vodafone claimed it was unable to negotiate competitive rates with Phones 4u after its private equity firm owners loaded the company with £505million of debt – and used £200million to pay shareholders a dividend. Scroll down for video . On the high street: Staff talk to each other as they wait outside the Phones 4U store in Chingford, Essex, today . Yesterday the jobs of 5,596 employees were . threatened when the mobile phone supplier was put into administration. The firm is being threatened with closure, despite the fact that it has . generated sales of more than £1billion a year and a profit of . £105million. All Phones 4u stores will now remain closed while administrators . investigate whether the chain has a future, and check to see whether . there are sufficient funds to pay staff the wages they are owed. The company’s demise has created confusion among customers, but the firm . said existing contracts will be honoured and has promised that people . who paid money up front for new handsets will be refunded. Concern: Founder John Caudwell, who sold his stake for £1.5bn in 2006, said he was 'desperately worried' Phones 4u was founded by entrepreneur John . Caudwell in 1987, who sold the firm for £1.46billion in 2006 to . Providence Equity Partners before it was bought by private equity firm . BC Partners in 2011. Flamboyant Mr Caudwell, who lives with partner Claire – a former model – . vented his fury at the company’s demise on Twitter. In a series of . damning messages he wrote: ‘I am sickened and saddened for nearly 6000 . wonderful employees who made Phones 4u into a great business. #ruthless . vodafone #ruthlessEE.’ Shut: Two men stand outside the closed Phones 4U mobile phone store in Newcastle city centre today . E . Customer notice: Staff at 550 Phones 4U stores will learn today whether the business will reopen for trading . He went on to say: ‘Such a sad day for . Phones 4u and all its employees! Brought to its knees by ruthless . so-called “partners” moving in for the kill!!!’ However Mr Caudwell was also critical of private equity firm BC . Partners, which bought the firm using mainly borrowed money for . £600million. He wrote: ‘Unfortunately, combination of short-term private . equity strategy combined with ruthless network “partners” and . government killed Phones 4u.’ A Vodafone spokesman denied any inappropriate behaviour, saying: ‘We . were told by Phones 4u management that they had little commercial . flexibility due to their debt repayment obligations.’ EE said its . decision not to renew its contract beyond September 2015 was driven by . uncertainty over the firm’s long-term viability. But Stefano Quadrio Curzio, from BC Partners, claimed the phone . companies’ decision was ‘designed to inflict the maximum damage’, and . had left the board with no alternative but to go into administration. Yesterday employee Neil Douglas wrote online: ‘Hard-working people like . myself who go to work to provide the best customer experience possible . are about to lose their job by no fault of their own.’ And Phones 4u chief executive David Kassler said: ‘Today is a very sad . day for our customers and our staff.’ He added: ‘A good company making . profits of over £100million and employing thousands of decent people has . been forced into administration. The result will be less competition, . less choice and higher prices for UK customers.’ I ordered an iPhone 6, what happens now? IF you have ordered an iPhone 6 – or any phone – and it has not yet been dispatched, then your request will be cancelled and your money refunded. If the phone has been dispatched it should arrive as expected. How do I return faulty goods? Stores will remain closed until the administrators decide how the company will be dealt with. The website is also offline, but you can still call 0844 8712253 for customer services, and if you bought your mobile using a credit card and paid more than £100 you can ask your card company for a refund. If you paid by debit card you have similar protection under chargeback rules. Will my mobile still work if they go bust? Yes. Most people who bought a phone with Phones 4u are actually customers of networks such as EE, O2, Vodafone and Three. You will be able to use your phone as normal. Will my bill increase? Phones 4u says any contract agreed with the shop should remain the same. But until administrators have calculated the assets of the company, there is no guarantee of this. Is my mobile phone insurance still valid? Anyone who purchased mobile phone insurance from Phones 4u should still be protected as the policy is operated by a separate firm. Where do I go now to compare prices? Phones 4u was one of the few stores which offered contracts from a number of networks under one roof. The only major alternatives now are Carphone Warehouse, Currys and internet comparison sites. Bled to death by the private equity leeches . Consumer choice and jobs on the High Street have once again been placed in jeopardy by the rapacious behaviour of one of Britain’s private equity firms – which load the companies they buy with debt, then cut costs to the bone in an attempt to make instant profits, Alex Brummer writes. This time the group concerned is BC Partners, owners of no-frills Phones 4u, which has fallen into administration. The collapse of Phones 4u will give the shrinking band of mobile phone operators – Vodafone, Spanish-controlled O2 and EE (forged from the merger of Orange and T-Mobile in 2010) – an even tighter grip over the hugely valuable cell phone market. Most consumers, bamboozled by the vast array of tariffs and phones, have traditionally turned to companies like Phones 4u and Carphone Warehouse for neutral advice. The companies offered a path through a maze that only the most tech-savvy consumer could master on their own. But cost-cutting and a failure to invest coincided with the rise of smartphones being sold as design icons. So while Phones 4u stores began to look increasingly utilitarian and downmarket, the mobile phone operators turned their own stores into high-tech emporiums selling high-priced items of beauty. This coincided with regulators clamping down on mobile call charges. Phones 4u’s pricing model had always been to discount the phones themselves, and make up the shortfall on high charges for calls. But the regulators’ clampdown means, increasingly, that phone users today tend to pay more for the device – and they go to the phone operators’ more upmarket stores to do so. Phones 4U is threatened with closure . Many believe that the phone network operators deliberately picked a fight with Phones 4u so that they could expand their own business operations by picking up some of its stores and staff on the cheap. The company has heaped opprobrium on the operators O2 – which pulled out of Phones 4u stores in January – EE and Vodafone. The big three cancelled their contracts with Phones 4u mainly after disputes about the share of profits they received for allowing the company to sell contracts on their networks. This was certainly a key factor behind the decision to call in the administrators. However, it is impossible to ignore the dead hand of private equity. In the eight years since John Caudwell sold Phones 4u to its first private equity outfit Doughty Hanson, the retailer has been passed around among the private equity princelings like a second-hand vase at a car boot sale. After Doughty Hanson, it was sold to private equity firm Providence Equity Partners. Then in 2011 it was sold on to its current private equity concern BC Partners, a derivation of the collapsed Barings merchant bank. All of these deals were financed using debt, and the priority of the owners has been to run the shops for immediate profit. The lack of investment in staff and store development has proved disastrous. While Carphone recruited graduates, Phones 4u did not. Its staff were younger, less qualified and engaged in high-pressure tactics including ‘streetfighting’ – a practice of accosting would-be customers on the street. Sales targets were raised while commissions paid to staff were allegedly cut. Just to add salt to the wounds, BC Partners took on £200million of extra debts last year so they could pay their backers a special one-off dividend...of £200million. In effect, they milked the company for all they could while running it into the ground. In the end, even though the company was still trading profitably, it was left with little option but to close. The immediate beneficiary of Phones 4u’s demise appears to be Carphone Warehouse. Shares in its parent Dixons rose on the news of Phone 4u’s collapse, and it has promised to save 800 jobs at Phone 4u franchises in stores controlled by Dixons. However the concern must be that the phone network operators which left Phones 4u high and dry – to increase their stranglehold over the market – will eventually treat Carphone with the same contempt. On the other hand, Dixons Carphone believes it is in a stronger position as it is one of the country’s biggest distributors of Samsung, Apple and Sony products. Phones 4u never took that course – with a private equity firm leeching away its lifeblood, it was not able to.","John Caudwell, who sold firm for £1.5billion in 2006, said he was 'saddened'

"Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has described Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg as 'almost like...enemies' in their head-to-head battle for this year's Formula One world title. With six races remaining, starting with Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix, just 22 points separate the pair as they fight it out for the sport's most-prized trophy. Reflecting on what has unfolded between them on-track this season, Wolff concedes there has been a noticeable deterioration in their roles as team-mates. Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg have been involved in many controversies this season . Most recently Nico Rosberg allowed his Mercedes team-mate to take first place at the Italian Grand Prix . Toto Wolff admits Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg are 'almost like enemies' Speaking to BBC Sport, Wolff said: 'It has changed from, let's say, an almost amicable relationship at the beginning of the season to a very intense moment, where it was almost like realising these two are enemies competing for the world title. 'It's also a learning process. These boys have been calibrated their whole life that their main priority is to win the drivers' championship in F1. 'And here they go - they are in the same car, competing against each other for that trophy, and one is going to win and one is going to fail. 'This is a new experience for them - a difficult experience maybe.' Tensions mounted between the pair after an incident at the Belgian Grand Prix . Rosberg forced Hamilton to retire at the Belgian Grand Prix after clipping his back wheel . On occasion Rosberg has shown a ruthless side to his nature, such as in Monaco during qualifying, and again in Belgium where he opted not to take avoiding action, instead colliding with the Briton and puncturing a tyre. Wolff added: 'There are 22 guys out there and all of them are ruthless. They know what they want and they will try to take it. 'Nico has always been like this. I don't know why anyone had the perception of him being Mr Nice Guy.' As for Hamilton, who has again endured one of those rollercoaster campaigns that have become his trademark over the seasons, Wolff insists there is no need to change the 29-year-old. Hamilton celebrates on the podium next to a disconsolate Rosberg at Monza . 'He has found his own way and developed extremely impressively and he doesn't need so much management,' said Wolff. 'We need to understand what kind of background and environment we need to provide so he functions best. 'And it makes no sense to try to change a personality and say: 'You know what, you need to have the Niki Lauda, or the Nico Rosberg, or the Fernando Alonso approach, and you don't need your dogs and you don't need your LA and you don't need your music.' 'That's not the case. Lewis needs all that. It is his personality and it makes him function well.'","Pair have been involved in several controversial incidents this season .

"Radamel Falcao may not have found a house yet, but he looks completely at home with Manchester United. The Colombian has been staying at the swanky Lowry Hotel since his deadline day arrival at Old Trafford and his football is as stylish as the five-star decor. Take just one moment from the match at Leicester, three minutes after half-time. Picked out by Wayne Rooney in the corner of the penalty box, Falcao controlled instantly, almost magnetically.

The ball cannoned back off the crossbar, Kasper Schmeichel without a hope of stopping it. He barely even saw it. Falcao didn't score during his 70 minutes at Leicester - it's a matter of time before the goals start to flow - but his influence in leading United's attack is there for all to see. United are starting to feel themselves again, going forward at least. Defensively they were a shambles and they blew a 3-1 lead in embarrassing circumstances, but that formidable forward line is starting to purr again. The 'Gaal-acticos' are blowing away the dark clouds of the David Moyes era with hurricane force and Leicester certainly found themselves in a whirlwind at times on Sunday. For an hour at least, until United suffered a power cut at the King Power Stadium. To their eternal credit, Nigel Pearson's team had hung in there and surged back to claim a famous victory.

Falcao delivered the cross for Robin van Perise's opening goal for United on 12 minutes . Before the miraculous fightback, Falcao, on his first start, had been central to everything good United did. The speed with which he has adapted to life in a red shirt is incredible, it looked like he'd been playing alongside Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Angel di Maria for years. Twice inside the space of a minute early on, Di Maria tried to locate him with a diagonal ball from the left. It didn't quite come off but the threat was evident as Falcao tangled with Wes Morgan and Liam Morgan. And his contribution to the opening goal, on 12 minutes, was simply sublime. Collecting the ball wide on the left, he spun Ritchie de Laet as though he was invisible and set off like an express train. A sumptuous left-footed cross to the back post followed and Van Persie headed in with the aid of a deflection off Moore. And on the stroke of half-time, a Di Maria ball from the same flank was nearly met by Falcao as he dived forward to meet it. Falcao gave Leicester right-back Ritchie de Laet a torrid time as he led United's attack . Falcao shakes hands with Wayne Rooney prior to the kick-off at the King Power Stadium . His primary purpose is to score goals, of course, but Falcao has a much greater value than that. He will be a key component in United's well-oiled attacking machine. His passing and movement was superb, weaving in and out of the thin blue line. His industry raises eyebrows too - time after time he rushed back to mug an unsuspecting Leicester player of the ball in the centre of the park. Although the serious cruciate ligament injury that kept him out of the World Cup is behind him, Falcao is still short of full match fitness and it was unsurprising when Van Gaal replaced him with Adnan Januzaj with 20 minutes to play. It was at that point United's afternoon imploded. If Van Gaal's attack is the luxury penthouse suite, his defence is the grotty back street hostel. If United's philosophy this season is to score one more than the opposition, whether that means scoring four, five or six, then at least in Falcao he has someone who will deliver.

"Emiliano Martinez is set to make his Champions League bow against Anderlecht on Wednesday as Arsenal face a goalkeeping crisis. Wojciech Szczesny (suspended) and David Ospina (thigh) are both unavailable for the trip to Belgium. And Martinez, 22, is in line to deputise in goal for the European clash. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsenal's Emiliano Martinez training with Argentina U20s . Emiliano Martinez (right) will play in goal for Arsenal on Wednesday, as the Gunners face a goalkeeping crisis . Martinez (centre) let in five goals in his previous appearance - against Reading in the Capital One Cup . A product of Arsenal's youth system, Martinez had played just twice for the club - his last appearance came in the kamikaze 7-5 Capital One Cup win over Reading two years ago. Martinez spent a period on loan at Sheffield Wednesday last year. He played 15 times for the Owls but the Champions League tie in Anderlecht will be the biggest match he has been involved in since his arrival in England. Like our Arsenal Facebook page. Emiliano Martinez? Doesn't sound born and bred north London? You're right, but he's been part of the Arsenal set-up for four years now so is no stranger to the capital. He arrived from Argentinian club Independiente in 2010, joining Arsenal's youth system. He must be a talent for Arsenal to bring him all the way from South America? By all accounts he is. He's very highly-rated among the academy staff at Arsenal, playing regularly for the Under 21s, and was expected to make a significant impact at first-team level. He is a former Argentina youth international to boot. So it's not gone according to plan then? Not quite. Despite his talent, he has found it tough to dislodge Wojciech Szczesny and Lukasz Fabianski (now at Swansea) in the Gunners squad since graduating from the academy. He may have thought he'd be promoted to second-choice keeper following Fabianski's exit, but David Ospina's signing means he remains as third choice. So he's played twice for Arsenal. How did they go? Not great, he's conceded six goals in those two previous appearances for the club, both coming in the League Cup. He helped Arsenal to a 6-1 win over Coventry in September 2012 before conceding five more in the 7-5 win over Reading a few weeks later. He hasn't played since. Still, 100 per cent win record, though. That's not much first-team experience though, is it? True. But he spent the back end of last season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, where he made 15 appearances, in which he kept two clean sheets.

"Take a White House state dinner and multiply it by 50. The result is the most elaborate and unusual dinner of President Barack Obama's administration, a one-of-a-kind affair put on Tuesday night for a one-of-a-kind gathering of several dozen leaders from countries across Africa. The leaders are attending a three-day conference organized by the White House and aimed at boosting U.S. ties to the continent. Obama wasted little time highlighting his own personal connection to Africa during a brief toast. Scroll down for video . 'I stand before you as the son of a man from Africa': President Barack Obama offers a toast at a dinner for the U.S. Africa Leaders Summit, on the South Lawn of the White House on August 5 . Note-worthy: Award-winning singer Lionel Richie provided the after-dinner entertainment, singing hits such as  Easy and playing the piano . Guests at the summit dined on chilled spiced tomato soup and socca crisps, which are made of chick peas; chopped farm-stand vegetable salad using produce from the first lady's garden; and grilled dry-aged Wagyu beef served with chermoula, a marinade used in North African cooking, sweet potatoes and coconut milk. Dessert was cappuccino fudge cake dressed with papaya scented with vanilla from Madagascar. American wines were also on the menu. Guests were shuttled down to a massive tent erected on the South Lawn because the White House, as big as it is, does not have any rooms large enough that can hold the more-than-400 invited guests. ‘I stand before you as the president of the United States, a proud American. I also stand before you as the son of a man from Africa,’ Obama said drawing applause. ‘The blood of Africa runs through our family, so for us, the bonds between our countries, our continents are deeply personal.’ He warmly recalled family visits to Kenya before he became president, as well as stops at historic sites in Ghana, Senegal and South Africa with his family while in office. And he offered a toast to ‘the new Africa, the Africa that is rising and so full of promise.’ Award-winning singer Lionel Richie provided the after-dinner entertainment. ‘Tonight, we are going to have a party,’ Richie said as he took the stage and quoted from the lyrics to All Night Long, one of his top hits. He then played the piano and eased the audience into what he said would be a short party by opening with Easy, another one of his hits. Among the African leaders who arrived at the White House one at a time over the course of 90 minutes were President Salva Kiir of South Sudan, the world's newest country, and President Jacob Zuma of South Africa. Kiir wore a cowboy hat and waved dramatically to the media. Egypt's ambassador and Libya's foreign affairs minister also attended. Next to last to arrive was Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who has pleaded innocent to murder and other charges for his alleged role in organizing violence that left more than 1,000 people dead after Kenya's 2007 elections. The case is before an international criminal court, and Obama pointedly skipped visiting Kenya when he toured Africa with his family last summer. President of The Gambia Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh and first lady Zineb Jammeh arrive for the dinner, hosted by President Barack Obama . Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore and spouse Chantal Compaore arrive at the North Portico of the White House for the state dinner . Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, who last month visited Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone, attended along with numerous other Obama administration officials, members of the delegations accompanying the African leaders, U.S. lawmakers and business leaders. There was political, Hollywood and athletic star power in the crowd, too. Former President Jimmy Carter, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and de Blasio's predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, a sponsor of a U.S.-Africa business forum where Obama spoke earlier Tuesday, mingled with guests before dinner. Also expected were actors Chiwetel Ejiofor, star of the Academy Award-winning drama 12 Years A Slave, and Robert De Niro, NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon and Meb Keflezighi, the Eritrean-born American winner of this year's Boston Marathon. Cameroon President Paul Biya and spouse Chantal Biya arrive at  the White House . After greeting Obama and first lady Michelle Obama inside the White House, guests boarded chartered trolley cars for a ride to the South Lawn. Mrs. Obama wore a cream-colored dress by Prabal Gurung, one of her favorite designers, with cut-outs in both the front and the back and her hair swept up into a bun. The menu featured a largely American-style dinner with hints of Africa sprinkled throughout each of the four courses. Guests dined on chilled spiced tomato soup and socca crisps, which are made of chick peas; chopped farm-stand vegetable salad using produce from the first lady's garden; and grilled dry-aged Wagyu beef served with chermoula, a marinade used in North African cooking, sweet potatoes and coconut milk.

"A video has captured the astonishing moment a fisherman was rescued after three days trapped 30 metres underwater in the Atlantic ocean. Harrison Okene, a 29-year-old ship's cook, was the only known survivor from the boat of 12 men, which capsized on May 26, 20 miles off the coast of Nigeria. The footage shows the moment Mr Okene, who was left fighting to breathe inside a four-foot high bubble of air, reaches out a hand and touches one of the team of divers, letting them know he is still alive. 'He's alive! He's alive!' a member of the dive team can be heard saying in the incredible footage . It had been feared - and assumed - that all aboard had perished. Scroll down for video . Saving grace: Mr Okene had been trapped in the air pocket for more than 60 hours when divers found him . Touching moment: The diver's camera captured Mr Okene reaching out his hand to one of the team of divers, letting them know he is still alive . Lucky skipper: Mr Okene, the ship's cook, was the only survivor from the crew of 12 . Of the 11 others aboard the tugboat when it sank in rough seas 10 have been found dead. One remains missing, but search operations have since been called off. Mr Okene squeezed into a compartment after the boat sank and settled upside-down. Before closing the cabin door to stop the water coming in, he had seen three dead colleagues in the water. Quick-thinking Mr Okene took two mattresses from the beds and sat on top of them, hoping to stay afloat. He was brought to the surface after 62 hours. Divers were stunned to find Mr Okene alive after three days with no food or water . Long way back: After being brought to the diver's bell, Mr Okene spent another 60 hours in a decompression chamber where his body pressure was returned to normal . 'I was there in the water in total darkness just thinking it's the end,' Mr Okene told Reuters at the time of his rescue. Although . he could not see anything he said: 'I could perceive the dead bodies of . my crew were nearby. I could smell them. The fish came in and began . eating the bodies. I could hear the sound.' After days soaking in the salt water parts of his skin began peeling away and he was gasping for water as he could not drink the seawater that he was trapped in. South . African divers came down to search for any survivors of the Jacson 4 on . May 28 and they were stunned to find Mr Okene still alive. Quick-thinking: Ship's cook Harrison Okene, 29, managed to survive for over two days underwater by floating on a mattress in an air bubble . Miraculous: Mr Okene was the only survivor from the Jascon-4 tugboat that capsized and sunk in the Gulf of Guinea in heavy seas . Paul McDonald, a member of the rescue crew, said at the time: 'All on board could not believe how cool he was when being rescued. 'The divers put a diving helmet and harness onto him. It was amazing to be part of this rescue.' Mr Okene said: 'I hammered the side of the vessel hoping someone would hear me'. He spent another 60 hours in a decompression chamber where his body pressure was returned to normal. If he had been exposed immediately to the outside air he would have died. Kurt Glaubitz, a Chevron spokesman, said the boat overturned while towing a Chevron oil tanker in the Gulf of Guinea.","Fisherman was trapped for two days in the pitch dark with no food or water .

"A self-confessed tanning addict has told how her obsession has cost $50,000. Trish Paytas, 24, started using sunbeds aged 14 after her mother bought her forty sessions at a local beauty salon. She now uses the indoor device on a daily basis  - sometimes twice a day - in a bid to boost her bronzed complexion. Tanorexic: Trish Paytas has spent more than $50,000 on sunbeds since the age of 14 . Ms  Paytas, a lingerie model from Los Angeles, California said she first became conscious about her looks after being bullied at school over her pale skin. Mother Lenna, 53,who is also a frequent tanner, believed that sunbed sessions might help her daughter's self-confidence. However the teenager soon became hooked on tanning and has since spent $52,505 (£23,000) on salon treatments and fake tan products. But the blonde, who now lives in New Jersey, refuses to stop using sunbeds and relies on modelling work to fund her addiction. She said: 'It's definitely been worth spending all that money. I'm in the modelling industry so I have to look good all the time. 'Some people spend way more than that on cigarettes, so I just look at tanning as my guilty pleasure. Mum did the right thing, she wanted me to be happy.' Bad habit: The 24-year-old uses sun beds every day in a bid to maintain her bronzed complexion . According to pediatrician Sophie Balk those who suffer from so called 'tanorexia' feel more relaxed after sunbathing or a session in a sunbed . At age 17 new laws meant she was only . allowed to tan for 12 minutes per session - but before that she had been . going for 30-minute spells. And despite warnings that she risks skin . cancer, the 24-year-old claims: 'I'd rather look good dead and tanned, than pale and alive.' She even defended 'tanorexic' mum Patricia Krentcil, who made headlines after allegedly taking her five-year-old daughter to a tanning studio where she suffered burns. Patricia shocked the nation with her ultra-dark tan, but Ms  Paytas said: 'I don't know why people were making such a fuss - she's a beautiful colour. Her tan would look great on me.' Even when she's not in the tanning booth, Ms  Paytas regularly sunbathes with no skin protection- instead opting for oil to enhance the skin-browning effects of UV rays. She added: 'Doctors have warned me about skin cancer, but sun-beds give you a base tan so you don't burn in the sun. I never use sunscreen -only tanning oiI. but I don't have any moles. 'I've had itching and spots before, but I think that's the oil. And I don't worry about it making me look old. Mum looks like she's 30 and people say I look young.' In 2006 she bought a spray-tanning machine costing $700 (£450) and since then has spent $180 (£116)-per-month on spray - totaling $12,960 (£8,350). It's estimated that she has spent more than 66 days (95,292 minutes) of her life on a sunbed. According to Sophie Balk, a pediatrician at The Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in New York, those who suffer from so called 'tanorexia' feel more relaxed after sunbathing or a session in a sunbed. She told NJ.com: 'Some people even experience withdrawal symptoms... They may know it’s bad but they can’t cut back.' Time well spent? Trish's love of tanning means she has spent over 66 days of her life on a sun bed . Withdrawal symptoms witnessed in 'chronically tanned people' can include depression and anxiety, she reveals.The reason for this, according to Jeanine Downie, a dermatologist in Montclair, New Jersey, is because tanning can trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that can increase a sense of well-being. Many tanorexics also ironically believe that they look healthier with a darker skin colour. Of course, a sunbed habit can have dangerous consequences, even for occasional users; the increased risk of skin cancer for excessive tanners will come as little surprise to anyone.Sunbeds . The Skin Cancer Foundation says sunbed users are over four times more likely to develop melanoma than those who don't use them. Dr Downie told NJ.com that this is because tanning beds emit around 12 to 15 times more UV radiation than the sun. 'Every time you tan chronically your are increasing your chances of getting skin cancer about 75 percent,' she said.","Trish Paytas, 24, started using sunbeds aged 14 .

"Rio Ferdinand has lifted the lid on Wayne Rooney’s temper tantrums, telling how his former Manchester United team-mate used to 'smash up mobile phones in frustration'. Ferdinand and Rooney played alongside each other for 10 years at Old Trafford until the former left the club during the summer. And the QPR defender has shed new light on the current United captain's temper - although he admitted the England striker has now calmed down. Wayne Rooney had a temper in his younger days, reveals former team-mate Rio Ferdinand . The United striker used to 'fly into a rage about the smallest things,' says Ferdinand . Ferdinand acknowledges Rooney has calmed down a bit - although he's still prone to the odd outburst . Possibly Rooney's most famous outburst, against West Ham in 2011 when he swore into a camera . Ferdinand says Rooney would often be arguing on his phone outside the United training ground . In The Sun’s serialisation of his autobiography #2sides, Ferdinand said: ‘Wayne Rooney always struck me as a very angry young man, always arguing with people outside the training ground, especially on the phone. ‘He seemed to fly into a rage about the smallest things and went through mobile phones like they were sweets. He’d smash phones up in frustration, throwing them on the concrete. ‘I don’t know what happened but he did calm down.’ Ferdinand says Rooney (right) struck him as an angry young man, always arguing with people .

"By EDDIE HEARN . It looks likely that Nathan Cleverly will return to Tony Bellew’s backyard for their rematch - and the winner is virtually guaranteed a world title shot. I’m pushing for an announcement next week; the fight was originally scheduled for December 6 but with Kell Brook’s injury, November 29 has been mooted. It looks like it will be in Liverpool and we’re tying up the loose ends now but I’m confident it will happen. Originally, we were going to be in Sheffield which was a neutral venue but now Nathan’s going to be travelling to Liverpool again. Obviously he would prefer it in Cardiff or at a neutral venue but in order to achieve financial targets Liverpool makes most sense. Nathan Cleverly looks set to return to Tony Bellew's backyard in Liverpool for a much-anticipated rematch . Cleverly (right) would prefer to fight in his native Wales but Bellew's (left) Liverpool makes financial sense . You have to take your hat off to Nathan who doesn’t seem fazed by returning to Tony’s city. If a fighter is not fighting at home, he needs to be compensated. Although this is only two or three hours from Nathan’s home, it isn’t Cardiff and we have a unique situation where I promote both fighters. I have a duty to ensure both fighters get the best deal going into this fight which is an interesting scenario. I’m having to deal with both of them so the common sense argument is applied which is that if you’re at home you should take less than you’d get if you’re fighting away. That dynamic applies to all fighters, particularly at world level. We have already agreed with Kalle Sauerland that the winner will face Marco Huck for the WBO world title and they’re also happy for the winner, and maybe even the loser, to fight Pablo Hernandez for the IBF title. Whilst the fight will carry eliminator status, it’s actually more powerful than that because terms have virtually been agreed with the champion for the winner. Both men want the fight badly; Tony in particular. He lost the first fight so he wants to settle the score. Nathan doesn’t like Tony and wants to knock him out. It’s great to be involved in a fight where there is so much on the line. Cleverly and Bellew facing off ahead of their 2011 bout, which the Welshman won by unanimous decision . The one trend in my conversations with them is that they want to knock each other out, they don’t want to win on points. Nathan said he’s already beaten him on points now he wants to take him out inside the distance and Tony wants to flatten him, quite honestly. He’s a fighter who would be disappointed with a points decision. I think we’ll have a different type of fight to the first one, which was a great fight but at times it was strategic and technical. This one will be about emotion, ego and will to win. I’m very fond of both fighters. This is the first time I’ve made a fight at this level where ive promoted both fighters. It is difficult but I’ve told them both that it’s a great fight and may the best man win. Whatever happens, there’s a future for both of them in the division but obviously the winner will go on and do big things. It was another spectacular performance from Scott Quigg last weekend and quite frankly the time is now for the Carl Frampton fight. People have always said it would be great if one of them could pick up a world title, or both could have world titles, well now there’s no excuse. They are both world champions and it’s really the only fight that people want to see either of them in. Scott Quigg (left) impressed in his third round knockout of Stephane Jamoye last weekend . Quigg retained his WBA World Super Bantamweight title in the win and Carl Frampton must be next . We are co-promoting Frampton’s mandatory Chris Avalos but we’ve seen from correspondence to the IBF and Top Rank that Carl is injured and will not be able to fulfill his obligation within the stated period. It is likely now the IBF will grant a medical exemption and give him a further 60 days to make the fight. My decision to get involved with Avalos was two fold. One, I feel I can maximize his earning potential through the opportunities and my experience within this market and two it gives me an opportunity to make the Quigg vs Frampton fight next while compensating Avalos accordingly. Frampton has to fight Avalos by December 4 but now that he’s injured, he’ll have to fight him by the end of February. His injury puts more pressure on making the Quigg-Frampton fight because he’s now not expecting to fight Avalos until February or March and I don’t think the British public will wait much longer for that fight. If Frampton is not going to be ready until then, I’ll be looking to get Quigg out again before the end of the year. I’ve already made contact with the McGuigans and requested a meeting to try and look at the opportunities. As I write this, I’m still waiting for a reply. But there are no true obstacles in making this fight, only ego. Carl Frampton won his IBF super-bantamweight world title bout against Kiko Martinez in Belfast . Only ego is preventing a fight between Quigg and Frampton to take place . If we don’t get the opportunity to provide these two great fighters with the biggest pay day of their career, quite frankly both teams should be ashamed with themselves. In terms of the location, the fight will happen wherever it makes most commercial sense. Obviously, we wouldn’t be able to go outside in Belfast until June/July through to August or early September. The biggest indoor arena in Belfast is the Odyssey which holds 9,000 but this fight would quite comfortably fill the Phones4U Arena in Manchester which holds 21,000. My idea of a two-fight deal is purely based on giving both fighters the fight in their home town and, more importantly, the opportunity for them to make huge money twice. It doesn’t have to be two fights but when a financial opportunity like this comes up in the super-bantamweight division, you should be clutching it with both hands. Kell Brook had his staples out this week. Many will have seen in the Sportsmail story the horrific injury that was sustained but Kell is a remarkable healer and is already on his feet. I think we will see him back in the gym by the end of October. When you see an injury like that you wonder whether you’ll ever see him in a ring again but thankfully he’s going to be ok and he’ll be back firing in no time. Floyd Mayweather won again at the weekend and, as usual, everyone in the 147lb division will play the waiting game and try to get their shot. I said around a year ago I didn’t think Floyd would fight Amir Khan in May. He didn’t. I also said he wouldn’t fight Amir in September. He didn’t. I’m now saying he won’t fight Amir next May. Kell Brook is a fantastic healer and on the mend after being stabbed on holiday in Spain . Brook has now had his staples out and is expected back in the gym by the end of October . Now, I understand that everyone wants that fight but there also comes a time when you have to stop hanging around and prostituting yourself for a shot when you have an opportunity to give the British public what they want in a huge all-British clash with Kell Brook for the world title. From our side, we are prepared to go straight into the Khan fight. I spoke to Kell about this and his response was: ‘I’ll beat him with one leg’. We are already making plans for Kell’s return in February or March. If Amir misses the boat and doesn’t get the Mayweather fight he really is in no man’s land in the division. I reiterate my respect for Amir as a fighter. He’s achieved so much in the sport at such a young age but I feel we have an opportunity here to make something really special for British boxing. Perhaps he knows that defeat to Kell Brook may signal the end of his career. Amir Khan has failed to get his fight against Floyd Mayweather so a clash with Brook should be on the cards . We have a number of lightweights in our team who are all looking for that world title shot. Mickey Bey’s surprise win over Miguel Vazquez last weekend has triggered a number of calls from our fightes requesting that fight. I’ve put their names in the mix with Al-Haymon’s team. Richar Abril will defend his WBA world title against Edis Tatli this Saturday. I’m confident that if he comes through, I can deliver the shot for Anthony Crolla later this year. We saw the rematch between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora announced this week. Although the first fight was disappointing, expect the second to be closer. You have to feel for Fury, he has had three big fights scheduled and on sale over the last year, and all three have failed to materialise. I really hope for his sake, and career, that this one actually happens. The rematch between Tyson Fury (left) and Dereck Chisora (right) is set for November 29 in London . Finally our thoughts and prayers are with Jerome Wilson and his family after he was injured during his fight in Sheffield last Friday. I was at the fight and the paramedics and doctors reacted within an instant to help him. It’s been amazing to see the boxing community gather to support Jerome. It’s a special sport with special people.","Nathan Cleverly-Tony Bellew II will likely be in Liverpool .

"Fabian Delph has a big decision to make. His contract is running down at Aston Villa and he’ll soon be able to join any club for free. Now he’s an England international, he’ll be highly sought after. Who knows, maybe even the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City will offer him a deal — they need to fulfil English quotas and he’s a talented player. But a move like that is probably the worst thing Delph can do. Does he want to play regular first-team football for the rest of his career or become the next Steve Sidwell or Scott Sinclair, picking up wages but getting next to no playing time at a big club? Fabian Delph has seen his stock rise after making England debut against Switzerland . There was nothing wrong with Sinclair showing ambition when he joined Manchester City — a move almost impossible to turn down. But his career has gone backwards since. James Milner won 50 caps and five trophies at the same club but has never been a regular starter. Maybe he’s comfortable with his contributions but sometimes if you’re not getting enough minutes, you need an exit strategy. It doesn’t help when some clubs treat their players like commodities, offering them fabulous new contracts to protect their transfer value or hoarding them away to comply with player quotas. Then negotiations become like a game of Blackjack — does the player stick or twist? Scott Sinclair's career has stalled after his big-money move to Manchester City . The prospect of money and trophies is understandably tempting, but the focus should be on playing football and following a career path. It happened to me when I left Arsenal. I had already played first-team matches but I was offered a deal over the summer by Aston Villa. I’ve never liked summer moves — you can get overwhelmed by money men — and had it been negotiated mid-season with games coming thick and fast, I’d never have left. But over the summer it becomes less about football and the money creeps into your head. Leaving a top club might feel like the end of the big time but quick decisions have to be made for the benefit of your development. And it can work. Alex Song will seek to revive his career at West Ham after two years on the sidelines at Barcelona . Daniel Sturridge moved from City to Chelsea before settling at another top club with Liverpool and Gary Cahill played for Villa and Bolton before moving to Chelsea. England manager Roy Hodgson will also look beyond the top four for his players, so international chances will still come. Villa stuck by Delph when he injured his cruciate ligament so maybe he owes them. If he does leave, he must make sure he is going somewhere to play regularly. On that note, it has been a good few weeks for English footballers. A lot of young players have shown they are not happy to warm the bench and it’s a reminder that this game is about more than just money. Danny Welbeck left his boyhood club for the chance to become a No 1 striker and Micah Richards, Tom Cleverley and Jack Rodwell all moved to play regularly again. Whatever club you play for, it should hurt to the core every Saturday if you’re sitting on the bench. Your whole life has been spent training to play and every week you are gearing up for that moment. If you’re lucky, your career will last for 10-15 years, so you need to squeeze out every minute you can. That’s why it’s been so good to see these young players not taking the easy option. They could sit on the bench counting their cash but they have shown the hunger to play and it’s that desire you want to see in every player. PS Alex Song is a good example of the grass not always being greener. He was first choice at Arsenal before leaving for Barcelona in 2012. But was he realistically going to start ahead of Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets or Fabregas? He sat on the bench for two years but now wants a fresh start. His loan could prove to be good business by West Ham.","Fabian Delph's contract at Aston Villa runs out next summer and he will be available on free transfer .

"Rio Ferdinand returns to Manchester United for the first time on Sunday, complaining the club he served for 12 years never let him say goodbye before his move to QPR. Ferdinand made 455 appearances and a huge contribution to United’s success under Sir Alex Ferguson. But executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward stunned the defender by choosing to tell him immediately after the last game of last season, in the away dressing room at Southampton, that he was not going to be offered a new contract. As a result, the 35-year-old former England captain left for Loftus Road in July. ‘I had great years at Old Trafford,’ Ferdinand told the BBC. ‘I never got to say goodbye when I left, which was unfortunate, so it will be a nice opportunity to say bye to a lot of people who supported me and helped me.’ You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail preview: Manchester United v QPR . Rio Ferdinand will return to former club Manchester United with Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . The defender linked up with Harry Redknapp at Loftus Road in the summer after 12 years at Old Trafford . Ferdinand represented Man United with distinction for over a decade, winning six Premier League titles . Ferdinand’s feathers will be ruffled further by Louis van Gaal, who yesterday appeared to dismiss him as a has-been. Asked if Ferdinand would still be a valuable asset, United’s manager replied: ‘No. There is a time to stay and time to go and I think he decided to go. He was a great player and maybe he is still a great player, but there is always a time to go for a player in a club.’ This weekend the first extracts of Ferdinand’s autobiography will appear in a newspaper serialisation, with the centre half expected to give forthright views on John Terry, David Moyes and Roy Hodgson. Terry was suspended for four matches and fined £220,000 in September 2012 for racially abusing Ferdinand’s brother, Anton, during a game between Chelsea and QPR the previous year. Terry apologised for the ‘language used in the game’ but to this day he has not apologised to Anton. Rio is also expected to deliver his verdict on Moyes’s difficult 10-month spell as United manager last season and to talk about Hodgson, who chose Terry ahead of him for Euro 2012. Louis van Gaal has endured a turbulent start to his tenure at Manchester United as they chase a first win . New signings Radamel Falcao (left) and Daley Blind were unveiled at Old Trafford on Friday . The decision to move to QPR, said Ferdinand, was motivated by the chance to finish with Harry Redknapp, the manager who launched his career. ‘London and Harry were the two main factors,’ he said. ‘He gave me an opportunity to start at West Ham and this is going to be the final chapter in my career, and to finish it with him was a huge pull.’ Ferdinand and Redknapp may have to contend with a United side featuring five players making their home debuts following their £150m spending spree. And Van Gaal believes it will be easier deciding how to fit in all his new signings than managing the expectations of supporters. Angel di Maria joined Manchester United from Real Madrid for £60m over the summer . In that same BBC interview, Ferdinand was asked for his view on the changes that have taken place since Van Gaal arrived. ‘Pre-season was really exciting for Manchester United,’ he said. ‘They looked really fit, really decisive and they looked like they had a good understanding of the system. ‘And it was almost like a complete reversal once the season started. I think they will get it right. I’ve got every confidence the manager will bring back the good times for Manchester United. It’s just a matter of how long.’ But Ferdinand was critical of what many perceive as United abandoning their long-held policy of nurturing their own talent, a shift epitomised by the sale of Danny Welbeck to Arsenal for £16million to make room for Radamel Falcao on wages reportedly approaching £300,000 a week. ‘The traditional Manchester United fans, the real followers of the club, took great pride and pleasure in the club producing home-grown players,’ said Ferdinand. ‘It seems there might be a change in the order.’ Striker Danny Welbeck, a United youth graduate, was sold to Arsenal on transfer deadline day for £16m . Rio Ferdinand celebrates after Man United beat Chelsea to win the Champions League in 2008 . He said: ‘For a coach it is always easy because he decides what he sees. I observe and then decide. I don’t have any worries about that. What the fans are expecting and what I expect are different. The fans will expect a new start, of course, and with these kind of players a victory. ‘But I know as a coach that when you let go 14 players and buy six new ones, you have 20 different relationships in the dressing-room. The hierarchy has gone. Now we have to build up a new one and that always needs time.’ The vast sums spent this summer by United and other leading clubs have led Redknapp to call for a Premier League transfer spending cap. ‘To make it fair play we should be able to spend as much as Manchester United spent before we play them on Sunday,’ he said. ‘What is fair play? One team can spend £200m on their team and another eight or ten million. That’s not fair play. How is it a fair play league when we spend £26-£28m? Fair play would be everybody having a maximum of £30m or whatever to spend and having to bring some players out of the youth team.’ The full interview will be shown on Football Focus, Saturday 12.10pm on BBC One.","Rio Ferdinand returns with QPR to Manchester United on Sunday .

"A freak stroke of bad luck turned a Florida high schooler's serious but treatable injury into a situation so severe it required the boy's leg to be amputated. Leshawn Williams, a 17-year-old defensive lineman at Northeast High School in St. Petersburgh, was injured  in a game against Clearwater High School on Friday night. He was rushed to an area hospital, where doctors would discover that the injury had caused a circulation-strangling clot behind his knee that would soon cost him a limb. Freak accident: Leshawn Williams, a 17-year-old defensive lineman at Northeast High School in St. Petersburgh, was injured in a game Friday night, leading to his leg amputation . Tense moments: It was clear from the start that Williams' injury would require immediate treatment Friday, but no one would have guest just how serious as he was wheeled off the field. Here, Williams is seen being wheeled off the field as his teammates looked on Friday . Couldn't feel his toes: Blood clots in the defensive lineman's knee caused blood to stop flowing to Williams' right lower leg . His injury was serious from the start and caused a half-hour delay in the game before Williams was taken off the field in a stretcher. When he arrived at the hospital, he complained he was in pain, but more importantly that he couldn't feel his toes. Doctors spent the weekend attempting to get the blood flowing back into the limb, the Tampa Bay Times reports. The decision to amputate below the right knee was made Sunday. Williams' mother Bonita Copeland said she didn't tell her son about the amputation until the surgery was over and that he continues to come to terms with the loss of his leg. 'It was a freak accident and it could've been something worse,' Copeland said. 'Even though my son lost his leg, I'm happy he's still here.' So what was so freakish that a teenage athlete lost a limb? One expert told the Tampa Bay Times that Williams' injury sounded like 'compartment syndrome.' Compartment syndrome develops when swelling or bleeding occurs within a compartment, which are groupings of muscles, nerves and blood vessels within joints. Broncos safety Rahim Moore nearly lost his leg from such an injury in 2013. However, compartment syndrome is rarely seen in football players. Williams' coach Jeremy Frioud told The Tampa Bay Times on Monday that the surgery was successful. His teammates planned to wear stickers bearing his number '69' at the next game in his honor. Williams mother first believed her son had injured his medial collateral ligament or MCL, which would not have been uncommon for a football player. She said she didn't reveal the amputation to her son until after the surgery. Here, a gurney is seen before it was used to wheel Williams off the field . Though only rarely seen in football players, an injury-induced ailment called 'compartment syndrome' has been known to cause athletes to lose a limb. Compartment syndrome develops when swelling or bleeding occurs within a compartment, which the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons says can be caused by athletic exertion or an impact injury. Broncos safety Rahim Moore underwent emergency surgery in 2013 to staunch bleeding in the muscle sheath in his lower left leg, a condition known as lateral compartment syndrome. Moore's surgery was successful and he's since returned to the field. Some fare better: Broncos safety Rahim Moore (26), here catching an interception against the San Diego Chargers, suffered from a form of compartment syndrome that nearly cost him his leg in 2013 .","Leshawn Williams, a 17-year-old defensive lineman for Northeast High School in the Tampa Bay, lost his right leg following a game Friday night .

"Arsenal are ready to make another move for Chris Smalling in the January transfer window following the defensive injury crisis that has engulfed them since losing Mathieu Debuchy last weekend. Despite Smalling’s failure to live up to expectations at Manchester United, Arsene Wenger still rates the central defender, having been on the point of signing him from Fulham in January 2010, before a last-minute intervention by Sir Alex Ferguson saw the defender opt for United. Last month Wenger had insisted on Smalling being part of any swap deal that took place with Manchester United for Thomas Vermaelen – but United refused to include him and Vermaelen ended up at Barcelona. Arsene Wenger is considering another move for Manchester United defender Chris Smalling . Arsenal tried to sign Smalling (above)  in the summer following the loss of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona . Smalling has struggled to live up to expectations himself at United, though new manager Louis van Gaal has started with him in games and the centre half is currently on his way back from a groin injury and available to play against Leicester today (Sun). But van Gaal has also indicated that he wants to add to his defensive positions in January and if that means Smalling is left out, Arsenal will make their move. Wenger inquired about the availability of Smalling and Phil Jones, another player Arsenal tried to sign in 2010, when United and Arsenal were in talks about a potential Vermaelen move last month but was told neither was available. United might be sensitive to a deal perceived to be helping Arsenal’s situation, given the criticism the club received for letting Danny Welbeck joining Arsenal for £16m on transfer deadline day and the fact the two clubs are likely to be battling for Champions League places. Arsenal require defensive cover after Mathieu Debuchy was injured against Manchester City . Arsenal players celebrate Mesut Ozil's goal in their 3-0 victory over Aston Villa . Only last weekend Wenger was insisting that three centre halves could be enough to see Arsenal through the season, but with Debuchy now out, possibly for three months if he needs surgery, the club look incredibly frail at the back. Calum Chambers can fill in at right back but is also the club’s first choice back-up in central defence and is only 19 years old. Hector Bellerin played at right back against Borussia Dortmund but struggled in a poor Arsenal performance. Arsenal are already looking at possible free agents they could sign to bolster their defence in the short term but ultimately it looks as if they will need to make the move to sign another established defender.

"Roberto Martinez claimed the Europa League would aid Everton's development but it seems the Blues have already benefited from the competition after just one fixture. Dispatching of Wolfsburg with an impressive 4-1 victory, optimism is sky high once more. Thursday night’s clash felt more like a celebration of Everton’s return to European football rather than the tough Group H fixture it had been billed as. Such was the ease of the win, each goal and attack felt almost like a showreel of the memorable moments Evertonians will hope to witness this term against the continent’s best sides. We've done it, Leighton: Steven Naismith celebrates with Baines after he scored a penalty in the 48th minute . Sealed with a kiss: Seamus Coleman embraces Baines after the defender netted from the penalty spot . Follow all the latest #UEL action on: . - Twitter - UEFAEuropaLeague . - Facebook - EuropaLeague . -  Website -  uefa.com . To add to the magic and nostalgia a night game on Merseyside brings, the Toffees have installed brand new floodlights which certainly boosted the atmosphere – European football had officially returned to Goodison Park. However, with all the excitement Everton left back Bryan Oviedo - closing in on full fitness having broken his leg in January – appeared to arrive at the ground late. Cue mad panic from one particular steward who frantically attempted to get the wideman seated and primed for the action. Had the Costa Rican turned up two minutes late for Everton's previous home game - against Chelsea - he'd have missed the current Premier League leaders opening two goals! One man who was on time was Manchester City Edin Dzeko, sat in the Goodison Road stand to watch his former club Wolfsburg. Leaving with five minutes to go, the Bosnian will be disappointed to have missed Ricardo Rodriguez’s consolation free-kick. Down and out: Wolfsburg were put to the sword by Everton in Thursday night's Europa League fixture . Net gains: Coleman scores from close range to double Everton's advantage at Goodison Park . Everton's ability to make top-class opposition look so ordinary was hugely impressive and the performance felt like the start of something big for the blue half of Merseyside. The Blues certainly hit top gear on their ‘Road to Warsaw’ and manager Martinez will be confident his side can go far in this season's tournament. There was an expectancy the Blues would deliver as soon as the first few corners and free-kicks were met with that famous Goodison roar. There was a definite buzz in the air as Everton marked their return to European football in style. However, while Everton deserved their victory, it was a bizarre match. Despite seeing their side score four goals, Blues fans picked goalkeeper Tim Howard as their Man of the Match. It was one of those games; open for the majority but it has to be noted the Toffees’ win was never in doubt at any point during the game. A bizarre match followed a surreal start to the evening – not only were Everton not allowed to walk out to the iconic ‘Z Cars’ song under UEFA regulations but some fans will have been devastated to learn that beer was also banned in the ground! On target: Naismith' 15th-minute strike deflected in off Wolfsburg defender Ricardo Ivan Rodríguez . Leading the way: The Scotland international wheels away in celebration after helping Everton take the lead . Fans can watch Everton in the Europa League live on ITV 4 . Back on the pitch, with this year’s Europa League winners gaining automatic entry into next season’s Champions League, Everton will be eager to build on their enthralling start to the campaign. Both sides showed Europe’s secondary competition the full respect it deserves by playing their strongest teams which, of course, made for a better match in terms of tactics and play; a real match-up of the Barclays Premier League and Bundesliga’s fifth-best clubs. While the football was entertaining from start to finish, one of the biggest cheers of the night came as Darron Gibson was introduced from the bench following an eleven-month spell on the sidelines through injury. Delighted to see the midfielder return, the Goodison faithful gave the 26-year-old a rousing reception in another extremely positive moment of the 90 minutes. In action: Former Chelsea man Romelu Lukaku battles for the ball under the lights at Goodison Park . Gibson later said on social media: ‘Been a long hard 11 months for me, absolutely delighted to get back on that pitch tonight! Great win by the lads.’ It seems it was smiles on faces for everyone connected with the club as two of Everton’s summer arrivals, youngsters Brendan Galloway and David Henen, were seen laughing and joking outside the ground ahead of kick-off – settling in well on Merseyside. Pundit Peter Reid – a member of the Everton team who defeated Bayern Munich in 1985 during one of Goodison’s greatest nights - was delighted too, happy to see the club perform so well on their return and could not hide his pleasure on the ITV4 sofa. With the Everton camp on cloud nine, Wolfsburg’s night didn’t go to plan at all. Welcome back: Goodison Park looked a picture under the floodlights . After defender Rodriguez was unlucky to see the ball ricochet off him and into his own net, the game was halted as goalkeeper Diego Benaglio left the field of the play – much to the bemusement of fans around the ground. Some rumours quickly circulated the Swiss goalkeeper requested to quickly go off to replace a contact lens while other whispers, perhaps mischievously, claimed Benaglio had to leave the field in order to take a toilet break. Not ideal timing. Ahead of kick-off Wolfsburg’s vocal support had made themselves known, loud and brash, unfurling huge flags in the Lower Bullens. However, with the game as good as over just minutes into the second half that exuberance quelled as trouble brewed among the away fans; add to that sightings of a streaker and it was all going on in one small corner of the ground. The teams of German media personnel packed into the front of the Goodison press box will have probably written more about what went on off the pitch rather than the action on it. As for Everton, following yet another classy win under Martinez, the feel-good factor continues to grow and looks set to sweep through Europe.

"Lord Janner, 86, faces more than 20 allegations of historic abuse at children's homes in Leicestershire . Police were blocked from arresting a high-profile Labour MP suspected of child abuse more than 20 years ago, it was claimed yesterday. Greville Janner, now Lord Janner, was interviewed by appointment as part of a major inquiry into attacks on boys at Leicestershire care homes in 1991. The prominent politician and campaigner, who represented Leicester West, was accompanied by his solicitor and did not face charges. Detectives had taken legal advice from a senior lawyer on the rare and potentially controversial move of arresting the serving politician. This would have given them the power to search his home and offices, as well as taking his fingerprints and other evidence. But sources close to the case told The Times that at the last minute the planned arrest was blocked. It is not known by whom. Arrangements were made instead for Lord Janner to attend a police station by appointment with his solicitor, Sir David Napley. Leicestershire Police confirmed yesterday that the decision is being re-examined as part of Operation Enamel, which is looking at allegations against Lord Janner and others. Investigators have consulted Kelvyn Ashby, the officer who led the original case and has since retired. Lord Janner, now aged 86, faces more than 20 allegations of historic abuse at children’s homes, including claims of rape and sexual assault. They suspect he used his hobby as a magician – he is a member of the magic circle – to get close to his victims and gain their trust. One man said he was seven-years-old when the politician visited his care home and left him ‘scarred for life’ by sexually assaulting him. But in an unusual move, police have not interviewed Lord Janner under caution or arrested him over the damaging allegations. This is despite searching his home in Golders Green, North London, and Parliamentary office during the course of their nine month inquiry. It is believed that the Labour peer’s poor health, he suffers advanced dementia, has prevented officers from speaking to him. A partial file of evidence has been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which is providing the police with ‘investigative advice’. Yet, some fear Lord Janner’s rapidly failing health could lead to him escaping prosecution. He has strongly denied the allegations against him in the past. It will ultimately be for the CPS to decide whether there is enough evidence and it is in the public interest to put him on trial. In 1991, the MP received all-party support when he told the House of Commons that there was ‘not a shred of truth’ in the allegations made against him. Lord Janner has not registered his attendance at the House of Lords since police raided his £600,000 North London apartment last December. Lord Janner chairs the Holocaust Educational Trust and is vice-president of the World Jewish Congress . The investigation into Lord Janner and others is one of dozens of historic abuse inquiries taking place across Britain. Chief constables are so concerned that they have brought together a nationwide group to oversee cases involving ‘persons of public prominence’. Lord Janner, who represented Leicester North West and then Leicester West for 27 years, was made a life peer on his retirement from Parliament in 1997. The father-of-three, whose wife of more than 40 years died in 1996, became a barrister in 1954 and was appointed a QC in 1971. He is associated with a number of Jewish organisations, having served as president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews from 1978 to 1984. He chairs the Holocaust Educational Trust and is vice-president of the World Jewish Congress. The Labour peer is described on his website as ‘a key international figure in efforts to seek compensation and restitution for Holocaust victims.’ A Leicestershire police spokesman said it is ‘investigating several complaints in relation to Operation Enamel — it is an inquiry into allegations of criminal conduct and all appropriate lines of inquiry will be progressed.’ Asked if the decision not to arrest Lord Janner was part of the new investigation, the spokesman said: ‘This is an operational matter, no further details will be disclosed.’","Greville Janner was interviewed by appointment as part of a major inquiry .

"The Class of '92 have agreed a remarkable deal that will see Singapore billionaire Peter Lim assume a 50 per cent stake in Salford City. Sportsmail can reveal that five former Manchester United stars - Gary and Phil Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt - will each retain 10 per cent of the non-League club. The terms of the deal dictates that the Class of '92 will collectively maintain an equal share of the power. Lim, however, will become the leading individual shareholder after acquiring 50 per cent of the club. The deal remains subject to FA approval. Nicky Butt (left), Paul Scholes (second left), Gary Neville (second right) and Ryan Giggs watching Salford City . Lim, 61, is estimated by Forbes to boast a net worth of £1.5billion and intriguingly, he made a bid worth in excess of £300m to buy Liverpool in 2010, before the Merseyside club was sold to Fenway Sports Group. Singapore businessman Peter Lim, pictured in 2010, will have a 50 per cent stake in Salford City . Despite his flirtation with Liverpool, Lim is a lifelong Manchester United supporter and he is believed to enjoy a long-standing professional relationship with the former United players. Lim is the owner of Manchester United Food and Beverage (Asia), where he has developed a chain of United restaurant and bars in the Asia Pacific Region. It is understood that the official documentation will be received by the FA on Monday and the prospective owners do not anticipate any hiccups. If all goes as expected, the Class of '92 and Lim will be confirmed and ratified as the new owners of Salford City in the near future. The five former players agreed a deal to take over Salford in the spring but the application has been delayed while legal issues were resolved. The process should now accelerate after the papers are transferred to the governing body this week. The Class of 92 quintet said in a Salford City statement: 'When we set upon this journey we always knew at some point we wanted external partners involved, people who would share our vision for Salford City FC. We have all known Peter for over 10 years, his love of sport, above all football, is well documented. He has an incredible track record in business as well as youth and community engagement, especially at grassroots level. This will be fantastic for SCFC, Peter’s experience and knowledge is invaluable and can help take SCFC to where we believe they can be, it’s exciting times for the club'. The club have made an unbeaten start to the season and they sit four points clear at the top of the Evostik League Northern Premier after manager Phil Power guided his team to six victories from their opening seven league games. Phil Neville (back row left), Butt (front row left), Gary Neville (front row, second left), Giggs (front row, second right) and Scholes (front row right) all retain a 10 per cent stake in Salford City . It is understood that neither the Class of '92 nor Lim have any intention, as things stand, of altering the management structure in place at the club. The potential for rapid growth at Salford City is believed to have tempted Lim to come on board. Certainly, Salford now find themselves in an immensely privileged position for a club in the eighth tier of English football. There will be many Football League clubs glancing envious glances towards Salford, who now possess the expertise of five of Manchester United’s most famous sons as well as the ambition and wealth of billionaire Lim, who is ranked by Forbes as the ninth richest man in Singapore. The objectives for the new owners are clear: to establish Salford City as a breeding ground for young local talent while the owners are also united by their long-term dream to guide the club into the Football League. Lim is viewed as an ideal partner due to his track record of investing into sport and community projects. It is believed that the self-made businessman has pledged £20m in the last five years alone to aid community initiatives.

A spokesperson for Lim is: 'Peter met with the lads a few months ago and they explained their plans and rationale for Salford City FC, The Academy and the investment in grassroots football. What the lads want to accomplish resonated strongly with Peter who shares a common belief with the lads in youth development through sports. 'Peter has high regard for footballers’ talents and dedication to their sport. He is convinced that the legends’ sporting training has imbued them with values such as humility, discipline and the tenacity to succeed. He hopes that these values can be cultivated in the young footballers who will come through SCFC’s programme. 'The management of the club on a day-to-day basis, as announced back in March, will remain the same, this arrangement is important to all concerned” Lim is also close to sealing a takeover of Spanish top-flight side Valencia, although the completion of that particular deal has been delayed by the continued tension between Lim and the Spanish finance company Bankia.","Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt will all retain 10 per cent each of Salford City .

Kimetto set a very quick pace from the start in perfect marathon-running conditions and shaved 26 seconds off the previous best time, also set in Berlin last year .

Ethiopia's Abera Kuma finished third in 2:05:56. All the times are as yet unofficial. The race in German capital saw some 40,0004 runners from 130 nations compete in perfect clear conditions. Kimetto, the pre-race favourite, set a scintillating pace from the starting gun and broke away with a group of six others after about 20km. With four kilometres remaining, he pulled clear from Mutai after the Kenyan pair had earlier shaken off another compatriot, Geoffrey Kamworor. 'I feel good because I won a very tough race,' the soft-spoken Kimetto told reporters. 'I felt good from the start and in the last five kilometres I felt I could do it (break the record).' Kimetto's compatriot Emmanuel Mutai (right) crossed the line in second and also beat the previous best . The Berlin marathon drew just over 40,000 runners to the streets of the German capital . 1.

The tall Kimetto was by no means unknown and had provided evidence of his class at the distance with wins in Tokyo and Boston last year. He had promised to attack the record in Berlin if conditions allowed and on Sunday he could not have hoped for better weather. With temperatures hovering around eight degrees Celsius at the start and gradually inching warmer as the race progressed, the Kenyan stayed in the lead group from the beginning and was always positioned near the front. One runner was dressed as the popular German wheat beer brand Erdinger as they completed the course . Runners assembled on the starting line with the iconic Brandenburg Gate in the background . The last pacemakers stepped aside at around 30 kilometres as the Kenyan trio gradually broke clear. Mutai twice attempted to attack but Kimetto stayed strong and made his own move at the 38km mark, with his compatriot soon dropping some 20 metres behind. With the iconic Brandenburg Gate in full view, Kimetto powered through the final stretch to clock a world best, with Mutai second 16 seconds behind, and Ethiopian Abera Kuma overtaking a fading Kamworor late on to claim third. Ethiopia were successful in the women's race, however, as Tirfi Tsegaye Beyene edged out her compatriot Feyse Tadese in a time of 2 hours, 20 minutes and 18 seconds.","Kenyan Dennis Kimetto completed the Berlin Marathon in a new world record of 2 hours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds on Sunday .

"With a Premier League weekend fast approaching, it is time for many fans to check out their new signings. These 10 players have yet to play in England, and will be keen to impress. But what can you expect from them? 1) Toby Alderweireld . CLUB: Southampton. AGE: 25. COST: On loan from Atletico Madrid. Central defender or right back. One of the most promising signings of the window, having also attracted Newcastle and Arsenal. Alderweireld is a versatile and technically gifted defender who has represented Belgium at every level from Under 15 up. He has 37 full caps and played at this summer’s World Cup. He has a point to prove after being deemed surplus to requirements after one season at Atletico, where he had a limited role in their La Liga success. He is a graduate of the Ajax academy and played in the fixture against PSV Eindhoven in November 2010 when Luis Suarez first bit an opponent. Toby Alderweireld was signed by Southampton on a season loan and will be keen to impress this season . The Belgian defender excelled in the World Cup and is a regular for his national team at the back . 2) Benjamin Stambouli . CLUB: Tottenham. AGE: 24. COST: £4.7m from Montpellier. Defensive midfielder. Stambouli was behind Morgan Schneiderlin on Tottenham’s wishlist but he fits the bill for Mauricio Pochettino. He is a hard worker with an astute tactical brain who is tailor-made for the manager’s high-intensity game. Swansea were interested but Montpellier manager Rolland Courbis told them they weren’t good enough. ‘I don’t think Swansea are the Montpellier of England. When Swansea’s interest came to my ears, I almost laughed. I did a nervous giggle,’ he said. Stambouli’s father, Henri, managed Marseille in the Nineties, while his grandfather Gerard Banide was in charge of Monaco. Benjamin Stambouli was somewhat of a surprise buy for Tottenham and Mauricio Pochettino . Stambouli's father said he almost giggled when he heard of Swansea's interest in the former Montpellier man . 3) Radamel Falcao . CLUB: Manchester United. AGE: 28. COST: £6m loan fee from Monaco. Striker. A huge talent who must answer some huge questions. Is he committed to United, having tweeted shortly before his move that he was off to Real Madrid? Is he the same player after major surgery on torn cruciate ligaments in his left knee last season? Can he thrive amid the pressure of a genuinely elite club? United can only hope that the Colombian answers the questions with more of the incredible numbers that have shaped his career: 200 goals in 305 club games, with a further 20 in 51 for his country. On form, he’s a wonderful striker. Radamel Falcao poses with the Manchester United shirt and assistant manager Ryan Giggs . The pressure is on the Colombian striker to succeed after his loan move from Monaco . 4) Abel Hernandez . CLUB: Hull. AGE: 24. COST: £9.5m from Palermo. Striker. It’s a big signing for Hull, who hope the Uruguay striker’s pace will work well in conjunction with targetman Nikica Jelavic. Apart from the large fee, this signing is a gamble. Hernandez moved to Italy as an 18-year-old but didn’t score more than seven league goals in any of his five seasons in Serie A, culminating in Palermo’s relegation in 2013. He proved to be hugely important as they won Serie B last season, scoring 14 goals, and was also part of the Uruguay squad at the World Cup. Abel Hernandez's signature by Hull is somewhat of a gamble but he impressed for Palermo last season . The young  striker is also in and around the Uruguay national set up . 5) Daley Blind . CLUB: Manchester United. AGE: 24. COST: £14m from Ajax. Left back, defensive midfielder. He is familiar to Louis van Gaal, having been part of the Holland World Cup squad. Blind is said to covet a midfield role at Old Trafford and has been compared to Philipp Lahm. The son of former Ajax and Holland defender Danny, Daley won the title with Ajax four seasons in a row and is the 2014 Dutch Footballer of the Year. It will be fascinating to see how he copes away from Ajax, where he signed aged 10, and their manager Frank de Boer, who nurtured him. Utility man Daley Blind was signed by Manchester United from Ajax for a fee of £14m . The Dutch international is the sun of former legend Danny Blind and could make his debut this weekend . 6) Marcos Rojo . CLUB: Manchester United. AGE: 24. COST: £16m from Sporting Lisbon. Centre back, left back, left wing. Skilful and fiery, Rojo excelled at the World Cup for Argentina, for whom he has 28 caps. He is a player who needs to be controlled, as demonstrated by his record at Sporting Lisbon — in two seasons he was booked 17 times and sent off on five occasions. He is covered in tattoos and married to lingerie model Eugenia. He seems to have an aversion to using his right foot so watch out for his ‘Rabona’ kick. Marcos Rojo has more tattoos than he does Premier League appearances for Manchester United . The former Sporting Lisbon defender was brought in after an impressive World Cup with Argentina . 7) Sadio Mane . CLUB: Southampton. AGE: 22. COST: £10m from Red Bull Salzburg. Left wing, forward. His big-money move might have largely stayed under the radar but Mane has been monitored by leading clubs for some time. Southampton need his goals and Mane has an impressive record, scoring 45 in 87 games for Salzburg. The Senegal striker is quick and likes to run at defenders. Sadio Mane is a gamble from Ronald Koeman but his scoring record suggests it could pay off at Southampton . 8) Eduardo Vargas . CLUB: QPR. AGE: 24. COST: On loan from Napoli. Forward, winger. It’s been a strange few years for Vargas. In 2011, his agent Diego Cativa said: ‘We’re talking to clubs like AC Milan, Inter, Liverpool, Arsenal and others.’ Barcelona and Chelsea were also reported to be interested. But it all went cold after he joined Napoli for £11.5m in 2012 and more than two years on he has not scored a league goal for the club in 19 games. He has been loaned out to Gremio (nine goals in 37 games) and Valencia (five in 25). Now it’s QPR’s turn. Eduardo Vargas is somewhat of a journey man and QPR are the latest side to bring him in on loan from Napoli . Vargas is a regular striking partner for Alexis Sanchez with Chile and played at the World Cup . 9) Ricky Alvarez . CLUB: Sunderland. AGE: 26. COST: On loan from Inter Milan. Attacking midfielder. Gus Poyet’s side struggled to create chances last season and have gone some way to fixing that with Alvarez. They have an option to sign him permanently next summer. He is a fine player: good enough to play more than 100 games for Inter and to represent Argentina at the World Cup, albeit as a substitute limited to 30 minutes’ playing time. He scored four goals in Serie A last season and got eight assists, which makes his arrival on loan something of a coup. Ricky Alvarez had a sign season with Inter Milan last season and could be seen as a coup by Sunderland . 10) Esteban Cambiasso . CLUB: Leicester City. AGE: 34. COST: Free. Central midfielder. Cambiasso has done quite well for himself with five Serie A titles, four Italian Cups, four Italian Super Cups, one La Liga, one UEFA Super Cup, a FIFA Club World Cup and the Champions League. Even Jose Mourinho raved about him. He was released by Inter Milan in the summer after 10 excellent years and will spend the season attempting to marshal Leicester’s midfield as they bid to stay up. Nicknamed for years ‘El Cuchu’ — ‘The Old Man’ — he will bring masses of top-level experience to a squad who desperately need it. Esteban Cambiasso is entering the twilight of his career but Leicester have taken a punt on the midfielder . The 34-year-old was an unused substitute in the club's 1-1 draw against Arsenal in their last fixture .","Toby Alderweireld signed for Southampton on loan from Atletico Madrid .

"Harry Roberts, pictured in 1966, said he believes the justice system is too soft on young criminals today . Harry Roberts, the police killer who was jailed for life for murdering three officers, said he believes young criminals now get off too lightly. Roberts, 78, is believed to have been released from prison after serving 48 years behind bars for killing three unarmed officers in London in 1966. He was given three life sentences by Mr Justice Hildreth Glyn-Jones at the time who denounced his the murders as 'the most heinous crime for a generation or more.' A recent decision to release him by the Parole Board has been widely criticised, but Roberts said he regrets his crimes but believes he has served his time. The pensioner has claimed to have been appalled at the light sentences now being given to younger criminals who frequently escape with community sentences rather than being locked up. He told Radio Times: 'I can't believe how lightly those kids get off when they are caught. 'It's a joke, in my day it would have been two or three years in prison.' In the previously unpublished interview, done six years ago, Roberts also criticises the work of prison psychologists who he said were obsessed with finding a reason lurking in his childhood memories that led him to pull the trigger 48 years ago. He said they did not understand his background in the Army or that he had changed since the murders. He claimed he no longer wanted to be the killer who went on the run and tried to escape prison in the early days of his sentence. And in a rare moment Roberts admitted he regrets the murders and would feel the same if someone had killed his mother. He also accepts the criticism of his release. Harry Roberts (right), pictured in 2009 with a prison guard in Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire before his release . Pc Geoffrey Fox, 41, (left), Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25, (centre) and Detective Sergeant Christopher Head (right), 30, were all killed in the attack on August 12 1966 by Harry Roberts and his gang . 'Of course I regret it,' he said. 'I totally understand why the families of the policemen could never forgive me and wouldn't want me released.' Roberts, Duddy and Witney were sat in a van near Wormwood Scrubs prison on August 12, 1966, planning an armed robbery with a Luger pistol . They were approached by the three plain clothes unarmed police officers who had suspected there had been a jail escape . Roberts shot at the policemen in Braybrook Street while children were playing nearby . He killed Det Con Wombell and chased and shot Sergeant Head . Harry Roberts in 1966 . One of his accomplices then shot Geoffrey Fox . Roberts went on the run for three months and when he was caught he was sentenced to life in prison . His two accomplices are now both dead . Roberts was jailed for the three murders in 1966. He had been sitting with accomplices John Duddy and John Witney in a van near Wormwood Scrubs prison in West London planning an armed robbery. When the officers, who were not armed, came over to the van, Roberts shot Detective Constable David Wombwell and Detective Sergeant Christopher Head. A member of his gang shot a third officer, PC Geoffrey Fox. The former soldier then went on the run for three months until he was found near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, living in a camouflaged den made out of plastic bags and branches. His disappearance sparked Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt. Roberts was given three life sentences with a minimum term of 30 years. Mr Justice Glyn-Jones told him it was unlikely a Home Secretary would ever consider him for release. The judge's daughter has since said her father regarded Roberts as evil and would have sentenced him to death if he could have done. However the death penalty had been abolished the year before the case was heard at the Old Bailey. Roberts, then 30, remained on the run for 96 days – sparking Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt to find him . Roberts also failed in a plea to be released five years ago after it emerged he had made death threats to a woman working at an animal sanctuary. Joan Cartwright had complained about his behaviour when he was working at the East Midlands sanctuary in 2001 on day release from prison. Mr Justice Hildreth Glyn-Jones sentenced him to life . When Roberts learned she had given evidence against him he made threats to kill her and her husband, calling them up to five times a week from jail. Roberts has now been deemed eligible for release by the Parole Board. This assesses the cases of prisoners who have been sentenced to life in prison once their minimum tariff - in this case 30 years - has passed. For a prisoner to be released they have to be assessed as no longer posing a risk of causing serious harm. He is understood to have left Littlehey Prison in Cambridge and is expected to go to a bail hostel. The Metropolitan Police Federation has denounced the decision to release Roberts as a betrayal of police by the justice system.","Harry Roberts was given three life sentences for 1966 murder of the officers .

"Gruesome details emerged today that allegedly show how the naked body of American socialite Sheila von Wiese Mack was stuffed into a suitcase and was then caught on security footage being carried to a taxi by one of her suspected killers. Outlining the case against the widow's pregnant daughter Heather Mack and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, police said the evidence was 'overwhelming.' They say the 62-year-old was folded into the silver-coloured case, with her back arched forward at an almost impossible angle and her legs bent up around the sides of her head. But because she had been lowered into the 3ft-long suitcase on her side, the lid would not close completely over the body of the murdered 5ft 5in woman. In a panic, her alleged killers wrapped the suitcase in a sheet and pulled the cloth tight around it in the hope that it would disguise the fact that it was not closed. Scroll down for video . 'Overwhelming evidence': Police in Bali have revealed the case against the alleged killers of U.S. socialite Sheila von Wiese Mack (left) whose body was stuffed into this blood-stained suitcase at a luxury hotel . Investigators examine what is thought to be the sheet the body of Sheila von Wiese Mack was wrapped in . Grisly: Police claim the 62-year-old widow was beaten to death before being folded into the suitcase, with her back arched forward at an almost impossible angle and her legs bent up around the sides of her head . The allegations emerged as a police commander agreed the couple had rejected KFC when it was sent in . to them at their separate police station cells - he is in Denpasar and . she is in South Kuta - but said police did not intend to insult them . with food that black people would reject on cultural grounds. 'They . are Americans. We thought we would give them some American food and . they would be grateful,' said the Commander Djoko Hariutomo. 'So today they are eating . rice-based local food.' Police sources in Bali revealed that, contrary to earlier reports, the murder had occurred in room 317 - not 616 - which was being shared by Mrs Mack and her daughter at the luxury beachside St Regis Hotel in the upmarket Nusa Dua region of the holiday island. Mack's boyfriend was staying in room 616 . - and it was from that room, in the early hours of Tuesday, August 12, . that Schaefer, dressed in dark clothing, was seen on the hotel’s . security cameras stepping out into the corridor and taking the lift down . to the third floor. The alleged killers - her 19-year-old pregnant daughter Heather Mack and the teenager's 21-year-old boyfriend Tommy Schaefer - wrapped the suitcase in a sheet to disguise the fact that it was not closed, police say . Suspects: Heather Mack (pictured, left, in custody) and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer (right) are accused of murdering Mack's mother Shiela von Weise Mack in a five-star hotel on the island of Bali . He entered room 317 - it is not known if he knocked or whether he had access to the keycard - but some time later he is seen later allegedly lugging the suitcase on his shoulder as he steps out of the room. He decides not to take the lift - perhaps because he might meet other guests - and makes his way up the stairs to his own room. But in his haste, he made an error and found himself on the seventh floor and had to make his way back down one floor, police claim. Police who have studied the security camera sequences have noted that Schaefer was totally alone in the stairway, but it has not been revealed what time of the early morning he was moving between the third and sixth floors. He is then believed to have packed his own belongings and changed his clothes, including putting on a red and yellow jacket, before asking a bell boy to come up collect the luggage on a trolley. Security footage shows the bell boy . walking a luggage trolly through the plush lobby, the sheet-covered . suitcase lying under other bags. Schaefer . walks beside the trolley and it is he who lifts the case into the boot . of a waiting taxi before returning to the hotel with his girlfriend. Big Mack: Heather Mack (with towel on head) is served McDonald's (right of picture) after complaining that KFC was based on a 'racist' assumption that she'd like fried chicken . At . that stage, no-one appears to have noticed anything wrong, but when . Schaefer and his girlfriend fail to come back out the taxi driver . strolls around to the boot and notices blood. Security . officials tell him to drive immediately to the main police headquarters . in the area, in South Kuta, where stunned officers discover the . American woman's body, head and hair covered in blood, when they open . the suitcase. Mrs Mack was found lying on her left side, her blonde hair covering most of the right side of her face.She apparently died when blood blocked her airways after her face had been neaten so hard. Brute strength appears to have been required to 'fold' Mrs Mack into the suitcase, police said. Police . are expected to produce court photographs of the savage injuries Mrs . Mack received to her face, which appears to have sustained a number of . heavy blows. Despite police . sources stating earlier that she had been hit with a glass ashtray, the . object was described today as looking like an ashtray but which was . more 'ornamental'. At South Kuta . police headquarters today, Commander Djoko Hariutomo, said the evidence . of murder against Mack and Schaefer was 'overwhelming' - and he . cited one good reason for it. If . the murder had occurred in a cheaper hotel, which does not have such a . sophisticated security system, the police, he admitted would not have a . step-by-step replay of a murder. He . insisted that the actual footage from the security cameras and still . photographs taken from the security sequences were 'off the record' and . would not be made public until the murder case gets under way through . the courts. 'We have the . movements of all three parties in the public areas of the hotel - . including the stairways - from the second they checked in on separate . days,' he said in a reference to the mother and daughter arriving two . days before Schaefer. Accused: . Mack (pictured) has told her lawyer that she has been sexually . assaulted 'multiple times' behind bars. Michael Elkin said she was . unsure whether it was allegedly at the hands of prison guards or inmates . There . is evidence, as MailOnline has previously reported, of the mother and . daughter arguing over who should pay for Schaefer's room, number 616, . and there is the floor-by-floor playback of the man hoisting the . suitcase from the murder room to his own. Commander . Djoko, who appeared to leave little doubt about his confidence that the . case against Mack and her boyfriend is watertight, said: 'The evidence, . put together from fingerprints, security footage, the behaviour of the . suspects, all lead us to believe we have the right people in custody.' Mack . and her boyfriend are likely to be in custody for many weeks before . they are brought to court and formally charged, said Commander Djoko. The . pair are then expected to be moved to the notorious Kerobokan prison as . they are taken through the laborious Indonesian justice system. Along . the way, Mack, who is nearly two months pregnant, will probably give birth to . her baby while in custody and the question will then arise as to whether . the child should be placed in the care of relatives or friends in the . U.S. Asked about . suggestions that an alleged crime pending against one or both of the . couple in the U.S. could result in them being extradited to be dealt . with there first, Commander Djoko shook his head. 'We aren’t taking that into consideration. They are under arrest here. This is our case. They will be dealt with here.' Aside . from security camera footage that allegedly implicates the two . Americans in Mrs Mack’s murder, Commander Djoko said police have taken . statements from 16 witnesses. 'And that’s so far,' he said. Heather Mack (left) and Tommy Schaefer (right) face death by firing squad if they are convicted . The . pair, who have not been charged, continue to refuse to talk to investigating officers, insisting on . a lawyer travelling from the U.S. to replace the police lawyer who has . been designated to liaise with them, although it is understood she is . not getting far with them. Mack . has complained to a U.S. Attorney who reached her by phone that she has . been physically and sexually assaulted, a complaint that Commander . Djoko brushed aside as being 'completely untrue'. The 19-year-old . is not sure whether it was fellow inmates or guards who molested her, . her Chicago attorney Michael Elkin told MailOnline. 'It is very . disconcerting,' he said. 'She initially thought it was fellow inmates, but now she has discovered that not all the guards are wearing official uniforms.' There . is nothing else for the pair to do, said the commander. They glance through a newspaper but . otherwise, said the commander, they have no other form of . entertainment. Police claim the couple initially told them that they been taken captive at the St. Regis by an armed gang who killed Mrs Mack. They said they managed to escape the gang’s clutches and fled to the hotel in the Kuta area of Bali.","Sheila von Wiese Mack 'folded into suitcase with legs bent over her head'

"Louis van Gaal was quick to praise the fighting spirit of his Manchester United team after Daley Blind has scraped a late - and barely deserved - draw at West Ham on Sunday. '(United) showed a lot of resilience in the second-half... I must say what spirit from my team,’ enthused the Dutchman. But the reality is that United have shown precious little 'spirit' or 'resilience' this season - with the notable exception of goalkeeper David de Gea, who has bailed them out of trouble on many an occasion. Despite Van Gaal's praise, under his leadership United have not won a single game in the Barclays Premier League after conceding the first goal of a match. Daley Blind (left) rescued a point for Louis van Gaal's Manchester United with a last-minute strike at West Ham . Louis van Gaal's first league game in charge at United was a defeat by Swansea after conceding first . Unitd have not fought back to win at any point this season, including during this defeat by Southampton . This season United have let slip the first goal of the game on eight occasions. The best results Van Gaal's men have salvaged from these fixtures were draws against West Brom, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Stoke and West Ham. The other three games ended in defeats by Swansea, Manchester City and Southampton. It is all a stark contrast from the halcyon days under Sir Alex Ferguson's management, when United were famed for their fighting spirit, often scoring decisive goals in the dying moments after the referee's watch had ticked beyond 90 minutes. 'Fergie Time' has gone down in legend. The most memorable of all United's last-gasp goals are arguably Steve Bruce's two headers against Sheffield Wednesday in 1993. The late double averted a defeat during a crucial stage of the title race and kept United on course for their first league crown in 26 years.  Ferguson and his assistant Brian Kidd danced on the Old Trafford turf in delight. And while they were not Premier League strikes, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's injury-time goals against Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final may never be beaten for jaw-dropping drama or sheer bloody-mindedness. Steve Bruce celebrates his dramatic winning goal against Sheffield Wednesday in 1993 . But even after Ferguson's retirement, under the much-maligned David Moyes the Red Devils managed to fight back and win from a losing position on four occasions. And the Scot did not even complete a full season in charge at Old Trafford. United's reputation as comeback kings reached its zenith during Ferguson's final season at the helm. In 2012-13 they fought back to win from a losing position on NINE occasions, the highest number during any of the Scot's 26 years in charge. Wayne Rooney celebrates one of his two goals in the comeback victory at Reading in December 2013 . Robin van Persie (left) strikes as his hat-trick secured a win from behind at Southampton in September 2012 . The previous best seasons for United fightbacks were in 1999-2000 and 2002-03, when six matches were won from behind. Ferguson's United did, however, fail to win a single match when conceding the first goal during two full terms. That said, during one of those seasons United managed arguably their greatest fightback of all - but not in a single match. Trailing by 12 points at one stage in 1995-96, United reeled in league leaders Newcastle and left Kevin Keegan ranting how he would 'love it' if he were to beat Fergie to the title. He didn't and nothing better summed up the mental fortitude of the Ferguson era. By comparison, a late draw at West Ham renders Van Gaal's claims to 'resiliance' somewhat feeble.

"A year has elapsed since a photograph of Oliver Giroud in his underpants triggered questions about his long-term future at Arsenal. In that time, there has been a Wembley triumph, a World Cup tournament, a broken ankle, a new £80,000-a-week contract and, on Sunday, two goals against Middlesbrough as the FA Cup holders eased into the quarter-finals. Suddenly it is hard to imagine Arsenal without Giroud’s towering presence, the focal point for all the creative forces who swirl around him.

Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral) Arsene Wenger applauded the France striker for his progress since he arrived from Montpellier. ‘He understands now what top-level football demands,’ said Wenger. ‘He has improved on his mobility and his technical quality and, of course, his body is very strong and he uses it well.’ Giroud flirted with a return to France after revelations that he invited a model into the team hotel on the eve of a game last February. He was then dropped for the Champions League game against Bayern Munich in favour of Yaya Sanogo. But Giroud celebrated the anniversary of his indiscretion by proving his mind is firmly on his game these days. He proved to be the difference in what might have been an awkward FA Cup fifth-round tie, scoring two wonderful goals inside 135 first-half seconds. Middlesbrough never recovered. The first was a clinical finale to a long period of possession in which every Arsenal player touched the ball, starting with a roll-out from goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny to Brazilian centre half Gabriel, who was making his debut. This passage of play wound up on the left wing, where Kieran Gibbs whipped over a low cross which Giroud was first to reach, thumping his effort close to the goalkeeper but with enough power to beat Tomas Mejias. The second was a brilliant piece of swift thinking from Alexis Sanchez, who took a quick corner and supplied the perfect cross. Giroud was the only other player alive to the opportunity and he converted with a fabulous volley, swept past Mejias with his left boot. Wenger said: ‘It was a consequence of intelligence and technique from two players who responded quickly to a situation.’ With it, Giroud moved into double figures, a healthy goal return for a campaign in which he has missed three months after breaking an ankle in August.

Boro may have beaten Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City in the previous round but they never had Arsenal in trouble. The visitors seemed to accept their fate and focus on the quest for promotion. Five thousand headed back to Teesside singing their manager’s name, although he was less satisfied. ‘I am disappointed,’ said Karanka. ‘Everybody was expecting another game like we played against Liverpool or Manchester City and this is my biggest concern. We didn’t go out on to the pitch as we usually go. ‘The second half was better but in the first half I didn’t like anything. It is difficult to beat teams like Arsenal if we make mistakes like we made on the second goal. If you want to take something here, you have to be perfect, as we were at the Etihad Stadium. ‘The cups are finished for us. Now we must forget everything about them and work hard for two or three months if we want to play here next season.’ Szczesny barely had a save to make, returning to the team for FA Cup duty having lost his position as No 1 after errors at Southampton on New Year’s Day. Wenger likes his back-up goalkeeper to play in the FA Cup, and this offers Szczesny a far better chance of wrapping his gloves around silverware than David Ospina.

"There we were thinking this was an all-new Arsenal. Here was a match which, for much of it, appeared to build on that 2-0 away win at Manchester City in January. The renaissance Arsenal team seems solid, workmanlike and ready to hit teams on the counter. With Mesut Ozil orchestrating, Olivier Giroud turning into a warrior-like centre forward who can hold the ball up superbly, and the speed and skill of Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck wide, they are perfectly equipped to play this type of game. And with Francis Coquelin’s importance growing with every game, there seemed to be a solidity about Arsenal which has rarely been evident in the past. It is, however, something of a mirage, an illusion. They might appear more robust but their fragility seems to haunt them, hanging around like an un-exorcised spirit.

Alexis Sanchez celebrates Arsenal's victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in his pants with his teammates . Arsenal were in control of this game. They were defending well. The clock was ticking on and three minutes of injury time had been play when Shola Ameobi met a corner at the far post. Amidst the confusion – a ricochet off Tomas Rosicky, a bounce off Per Mertesacker – Wilfried Zaha drove in shot which David Ospina parried and in snuck substitute Glenn Murray to prod home a goal. Still, it was no more than a consolation. Barely enough time remained for Arsenal to kick off. Yet within the remaining 90 seconds, Arsenal demonstrated sufficient vulnerability to ruin their new image. Yannick Bolasie went tearing down the left and swung in a cross. Ospina came diving out to punch away and missed the ball completely. At the far post lurked Murray waiting to head home. He met the ball cleanly and yet hit the post with the ball rebounding into the hands of the fortunate and relieved Ospina. That last kick – or head – of the game should have seen Arsenal forfeit two points. And even though it didn’t, it was enough to suggest that old habits die hard. If Arsenal have truly changed, then maybe they could yet enjoy a sustained run in the Champions League and approach an FA Cup tie at Old Trafford with confidence. The final two minutes on injury time yesterday suggested otherwise. ‘We can learn from every game and I believe the players know that they switched off a little bit early,’ said Arsene Wenger ruefully. ‘Certainly they thought it was done. In the Premier League it is never done. And when that header went off the post, we were a bit fortunate.’ Crystal Palace were doughty opponents yesterday. They absolutely make the most of what they have. The return of Mile Jedinak from winning the Asian Cup with Australia adds more fortitude to an already hard-working midfield. The pace of Dwight Gayle and Wilfried Zaha and later Bolasie was always a threat.

I actually though the spin of the ball was going to take it into the net when it came off the post. It could have gone anywhere. It wasn’t to be. There was some great team play, some great individual moments and probably the best players were on our team, but we’ve lost.’ Arsenal were presented with an unexpected foothold in the game with a penalty on 8 minutes. Palace were aggrieved but perhaps only to spare the blushes of Pape Souare. Only last week Alan Pardew was warning that it would take the Senegalese left back time to adjust to the speed and intensity of the Premier League. He was miles off the pace on seven minutes, mis-controlling the ball and then lunging at Danny Welbeck as the Arsenal player chased the ball down ruthlessly. Palace’s complaint was that initial contact occurred outside the box – though Souare planted his foot on the line of the penalty area and his leg appeared to follow through into the box as he felled Welbeck. ‘It’s a mistake and he should better but the call is tough on us as it looked as if the incident happened outside the box,’ said Pardew. ‘he just got caught out and dwelled ion it and he’ll need to learn from that.’ Though it took several replays to ascertain the truth, on this occasion the instincts of the referee and his assistant were correct. Santi Cazorla took the spot kick, swept it confidently to his right and celebrated enthusiastically in front of the Palace fans. Thereafter, Palace played rather well but it was turning into a scrappy, physical game with little direction until Arsenal extended their lead on 43 minutes.

Giroud's goal came against the run of play, with Palace causing Arsenal plenty of problems without hitting the target in the first 45 minutes . Though the ball from Alexis Sanchez for Welbeck was utterly sublime, the effect was ruined somewhat by Welbeck starting his run a fraction early and ending up in an offside position - just – as the ball was played. He shot, Julian Speroni parried and Giroud, who has been superb holding the ball up in the build up, followed up from close range to score his 50th for the club. ‘The second goal is offside,’ said Pardew. ‘And that should be made that call. I had more problems with the second goal than the first. It’s just before half time and you have to get that call right.’ Palace were much brighter in the second half. Monreal was required to block a Zaha strike amidst a chaotic goal-mouth scramble. Souare showed his attacking qualities with a delightful cross which Gayle met and headed wide. Their efforts were ultimately in vain. But they came mightily close to exposing Arsenal.

"Phil Parkinson believes Bradford City can beat any of their FA Cup rivals at Valley Parade – including Manchester United. The Bantams boss wants Louis van Gaal's men in the quarter-final, should they get past Preston on Monday. And after disposing of Sunderland during Sunday's 2-0 victory to move into the last eight for the first time in 39 years, Parkinson says Bradford can again upset the odds and land a trip to Wembley in the semi-final. Phil Parkinson believes his Bradford City side can defeat anybody in the FA Cup at Valley Parade . 'If we get our approach right we have a chance against anyone,' he said. 'We would love Man United. The chairman will want to be away at a big Premier League club, but I want to be at home. 'Here, we can beat anyone if we keep the honesty and do the right things, play as a team. It is about individuals looking good in a team unit with no egos and then getting the rewards. Parkinson is congratulated by a fan after his side's giant killing of Sunderland in the FA Cup fifth round . 'The excitement will intensify now in the next round because we are one game from Wembley. We will give it everything, try to attack at every chance and walk off with our heads held high.' Parkinson's heroes were deserving of their triumph against a sorry Sunderland, whose fans turned on manager Gus Poyet. Goals from Billy Clarke and former Black Cat Jon Stead sealed the win, which was overlooked by both BBC and BT Sport for live coverage. And Parkinson reflected: 'We played with commitment. They pull on the shirt with pride and play every game giving it everything we have got. Billy Clarke (centre) fires the Bantams into the lead and the League One side never looked back . Clarke celebrates after his deflected effort but the home side ahead in the FA Cup fifth round clash . 'We started really quick and we were physical in terms of closing down and challenging. We set out to make it uncomfortable. We played with that underdog mentality and maybe we did catch them by surprise.' He added: 'We were disappointed it wasn't on TV. The finances of it - a quarter of a million pounds - would have meant a lot. We had to take it on the chin and put in a performance and that is what we have done.' Parkinson, meanwhile, was thrilled for striker Stead, who scored just twice during an 18-month spell at Sunderland and was mocked by supporters. Jon Stead (right) was subject to ridicule from the Sunderland fans but soon had quietened them down . 'He has scored in every round for us now and has been immense for us all season,' he said. 'It didn't work out for him at Sunderland but has moved on and is pushing on again in his career, which is great for a player who is 31, credit to him.' For Poyet, the sight of away fans fighting among themselves should be a concern. They chanted: 'Gustavo Poyet, it's always our fault' in reference to some of his recent comments. Vito Mannone (25) can only watch on as Stead fires home Bradford's second to seal the tie . And the Uruguayan said: 'I have no problems (with the angry chants from Sunderland fans), I get on with my life. It is normal, I am responsible. 'I have no issue with the fans. I never hide and at the end of the day I am the one who will pay the price because the one who can get sacked is me.' He went on: 'We tried our best and there are no regrets. Everyone gave their best under the circumstances. It was a great cup tie. Full stadium, two great sets of fans, fights, elbows, cuts, bad decision from the ref, we had it all. 'It was a proper old style cup tie with two teams committed. 'Credit to Bradford, they know how to play these games. It is not humiliating, it is what the cup brings into the equation. If the top teams always beat the smaller teams, then the cup would not exist.' Stead and Rory McArdle (23) celebrate the final whistle after their giant killing against Sunderland .","Phil Parkinson says his Bradford side can beat anyone at Valley Parade and revealed he would love to come up against Manchester United .

"The Champions League is back with a bang this week as three Premier League sides vie for a place in the last eight of Europe’s premier club competition. It’s extremely difficult to predict who will contest the final in Berlin on June 6 but football analysts BSports have predicted which sides will progress from the last-16 ties, which begin on Tuesday evening. For the English sides, Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea are favourites to dump Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal can get past Monaco but BSports, the latest addition to STATS, have La Liga giants Barcelona down to beat Manuel Pellegrini’s Manchester City.

Chelsea met PSG in an enthralling quarter-final contest last season with the Londoners prevailing on the away-goals rule after a 3-3 aggregate draw, despite the French champions winning 3-1 at home in the first leg. Having eased through their group and sitting top of the Premier League, BSports give Chelsea a 64 per cent chance of beating the Parisians to a last-eight spot. That’s understandable as PSG are third in Ligue 1 and wasted the opportunity to leapfrog Lyon and Marseille to go top, throwing away a two-goal lead at home to Caen on Saturday. PSG talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored twice in the Champions League this term . Fabian Frei scored Basle's crucial goal against Liverpool at Anfield in the Champions League group phase .

Manchester City and Barcelona met at this point last season, with the Catalan giants prevailing 4-1 on aggregate. Pellegrini’s side have been a disappointment in Europe despite winning the 2012 and 2014 Premier League titles, hence Barcelona being awarded 66.6 per cent in favour of defeating City again. As usual Arsenal have reached the last 16 of the Champions League and BSports sees them easing past Monaco with a 67.3 per cent chance as the French side are well off the pace in Ligue 1 in fifth place.

"When former U.S. soldier Jordan Matson learned about ISIS rampage across Iraq and Syria, he knew he couldn't sit back and do nothing. So the 28-year-old food packaging worker from Sturtevant, Wisconsin contacted the Kurdish militia - known as the People's Protection Units or YPG - through Facebook. 'I prayed about it for about a month or two,' Matson, a Christian, told CNN. 'And I really soul searched and said, ""is this really what I want to do?"" Eventually, I decided to do it.' Matson flew to Turkey and was taken to Rojava, a Kurdish-controlled area of northern Syria. For the past month, he has been a volunteer fighter helping to defend three small statelets in the area. Scroll down for video . Fighter: Jordan Matson, 28, has been fighting for the Kurdish militia in Northern Syria for a month . During his two years in the U.S. military, he never served abroad - but on the second day fighting in Syria, he was struck by a mortar round during a firefight with ISIS. As he recovered from his injuries - which sometimes still cause him to squint - he helped out the militia by taking to social media to recruit others, CNN reported. He's been contacted by many former soldiers from across Europe, America and Australia, he said. They are attracted to fighting for the Kurdish militia for the same reasons as he was. 'ISIS has threatened all these countries... to push their agenda in those nations,' he said. 'And the veterans of those nations who love their countries don't want to sit by while this is happening.' Calling: Matson, who is from Wisconsin, (pictured at home before heading to Syria) said he had long wanted to be a soldier and felt at home fighting on behalf of the People's Protection Units . New life: He left for Syria with a set of clothes, boots and deodorant - and quickly settled in, he said . While ISIS's efforts to encourage people to join their forces using social media has been documented, Matson's work gives an insight into how the Kurdish militia are recruiting from overseas using the same methods. Matson recently posted a message to his Facebook page, urging would-be fighters to 'be patient as the outcry to join the fight is immense'. Devoted: He said he is willing to 'stay until the end' Of his own decision, he added: 'These people threatened American citizens, and bring harm to us. I think I decided enough was enough, and I decided to come out this way.' He had contacted the group online after ISIS captured Mosul in Iraq. 'All the American veterans that have died over there and paid their lives for that country so they could have a democracy - that just resonated in my mind,' he said. 'And I couldn't live with myself letting that country fall, and all my brothers' lives be for nothing.' But as well as fighting for Americans - 'so [ISIS] can't take it to us' - he said he's also fighting for the Kurdish people. Aside from his political and religious beliefs, Matson explained that he was also driven to help because he has always wanted to be a soldier. After being honorably discharged from the Army in 2007, he missed military life. But due to problems with his record, he could not return, so fighting abroad has allowed him to realize his dream. 'Over here, everything makes sense,' he told CNN. 'I'm at peace being here.' U.S. law enforcement officials said it is illegal for an American to join a Syrian militia, but Matson's decision has been met with support from Americans, with some deeming him a hero online. He said that although he believes the U.S. government is watching what he does, he does not think they will deny him re-entry when he tries to go home. But if that does happen, he would remain in Kurdistan, he said. 'Once this fight is over, and ISIS has been crippled, then the next stage of my life, then I'll think about that,' he said. New friends: Matson, pictured second left, said he could not allow ISIS to take control of places, including in Iraq, after Americans had fought hard - and lost their lives - for their democracy . Matson is not alone: Brian Wilson, a 43-year-old Desert Storm veteran from Ohio, is another of the few Americans that traveled to 'help the YPG.' Earlier this month, Wilson's family said they were still unsure why he left behind his children to join up with the Kurdish militia, though a relative said: 'He's a real big history buff and he has talked about the situation there.' While Wilson waits to join the YPG fighters in battle, he says that the Kurds have welcomed him in their territory. 'Everything has been fine. They're very nice, very accommodating, hospitable. Very good people,' he said in a video.","Jordan Matson, from Wisconsin, watched as cities in Iraq fell to ISIS and refused to allow places American's had fought hard to protect be destroyed .

"With each passing day at West Bromwich Albion, James Morrison is witnessing the continuing revival of a natural-born leader. The end product will benefit Scotland’s ambitions every bit as much as those harboured at the Hawthorns. Morrison was thrilled when Darren Fletcher chose the Baggies as the club at which to continue his career following 342 appearances for Manchester United. James Morrison, pictured scoring in the FA Cup, was delighted when Fletcher signed for West Brom this month . Fletcher (left), in action in last Saturday's draw against Sunderland, was 'born a leader' according to Morrison . Fletcher (left) and Morrison (right) have played together numerous times for Scotland . All those phone calls to his international colleague – badgering him to make the move – were not in vain. The recent years of Fletcher’s career have, of course, been scarred by the chronic bowel condition that so drained his health before surgery provided the right path back to top-level football. To then leave United, whom he joined as a schoolboy and won five Premier League titles with, must have been an emotional wrench. But the exit has opened the way to regain the kind of regular action that will delight national boss Gordon Strachan as he ponders the remainder of the Euro 2016 qualification campaign. Fletcher was promptly made captain of his new club side by manager Tony Pulis and is undefeated in three appearances to date. His positive influence is being felt every bit as much in the dressing-room as it is in central midfield. The 31-year-old was an excellent servant to United, making 342 appearances in all competitions . Fletcher (left), pictured signing a contract extension in 2005, has a good relationship with Alex Ferguson (right) ‘Some people are born captains, really,’ insisted Morrison. ‘We have a good bunch of lads at West Brom, so that respect was there. ‘It was up to the manager to change the captaincy and Darren has been great since he arrived. He has settled in fantastically well. He has already been getting the lads together so he has done a good job so far. The former Manchester United midfielder opens up to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton in an exclusive interview about his crippling stomach illness . ‘He hasn’t really changed things. He has just been himself. He leads the lads out, shouts orders and gets us up for games. 'When he has settled a bit more, then I’m sure he will further stamp his authority in terms of what he wants at the club. He leads by example and does everything right. ‘On the pitch, he brings so much experience and energy. Obviously, the players we have in the West Brom midfield are all experienced but I think Darren’s presence rubs off on the other lads. It gets us playing well. ‘Can he get back to his best? I think he can. I know what type of character he is so I have no doubts about that. Just give him a few more games under his belt and he’ll be back to his best. ‘The more games Darren plays, the more his level will rise, as will his fitness and confidence. A fit Darren is a really good player.’ In December the then Manchester United midfielder opened up to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton about his illness . Fletcher, in action for his country in a Euro 2016 qualifying match in September, only recently turned 31 . Fletcher only turned 31 earlier this month, so his free-transfer acquisition might well prove one of the biggest bargains to be found in the cash-crazed English top-flight. ‘Darren was at one of the best clubs in the world so it was a big coup for West Brom to get him,’ admitted Morrison. ‘It shows Darren just wanted to play football, although there were family reasons as well and stuff like that. ‘I’ve known him for a long time and I know what he’s all about. When I heard there was a chance of him coming, I was on the phone to him, trying to get him here. I want to play with good players and Darren is certainly that. ‘How did I sell the club? I had my ways! I just said it was a real family club with great support. Basically it was all about the lads here and I knew he would fit in right away and he has. 'He’s enjoying it, he told me that himself. I knew he would like the manager and he’s played a big part in it for Darren, too. Tony has done a great job so far.’ The same could be said for Strachan as Scotland prepare to resume their bid to reach France with a Hampden qualifier against group minnows Gibraltar late next month. Morrison knows the task of taking on a side routed by Poland and the Republic of Ireland will be all about mentality. Scotland skipper Fletcher (left) has made three appearances for the Baggies since joining the club . Morrison (middle) knows history is not on Scotland's side ahead of the imminent Euro 2016 qualifiers . After all, Scotland don’t exactly have a great history against teams they are supposed to wipe the floor with. ‘We’ll prepare for Gibraltar in the same way we have for every game,’ insisted Morrison, who was speaking on behalf of Scotland team sponsor Vauxhall. ‘You can’t slack off in football because that’s when it bites you on the backside. You’ve got to be professional. With Gordon, we’ve been really switched on and professional . ‘I remember I played against Nuneaton in the FA Cup with Middlesbrough and that was a 1-1 draw. I think that’s the only really big upset that I’ve played in. 'That was a typical FA Cup game, a really good occasion and we did the job in the replay the following week. Hopefully we do our job against Gibraltar. ‘You just have to ride the occasion and beat what’s in front of you. With the players in our team I don’t think [a shock] will happen. We’re all looking forward to the game. ‘For me it would be a dream come true to play in a major tournament. The biggest thing, though, is getting there. We’ve had a great start but that’s all it is. We’ve got a long way to go. But I sense everyone is together and pulling in the right direction.

"Iraqi forces have recaptured the city  of Baiji in a significant victory over ISIS after more than two weeks of fighting. Baiji is the largest city to be retaken by government troops since ISIS-led militants overran much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland in June in their bid to create an Islamic 'caliphate'. The recapture  is also strategically important as Iraq's largest oil refinery, capable of producing 300,000 barrels of refined petroleum products per day, is located just outside of the city. Scroll down for video . Liberated: ISIS militants took the northern Iraqi city of Baiji in June (pictured) but the important oil-town has now been recaptured by Iraqi troops . Baiji  is located 130 miles north of Baghdad on the main highway Mosul, and had been under ISIS control since June. Although ISIS still controls the oil refinery, the recapture of Baiji further isolates militants farther south in the city of Tikrit, although IS still controls large parts of Iraq as well as swathes of Syria. 'Iraqi forces were able to regain complete control of the town of Baiji,' Ahmed al-Krayim, the head of the Salaheddin provincial council said. 'Soldiers, police, Shiite militiamen and tribesmen were all involved in the operation to retake Baiji, and are now pushing farther north.' 'Iraqi forces are on their way to the Baiji refinery where security forces have held out against repeated jihadist attacks'. Black gold: Baiji is strategically important as Iraq's largest oil refinery is located just outside of the city . The Iraqi town of Baiji is located near Iraq's main oil refinery on the main highway to the Islamic State-controlled city of Mosul . An Iraqi soldier walks through Jurf al-Sakhr after regime forces retook the town from ISIS militants last month . Breaking through to the massive refinery would be another significant win for the government in Baghdad. But the victory was marred by a suicide bombing Friday that targeted a military command headquarters set up at Tikrit University, south of Baiji, killing at least four people, army officers said. Three suicide bombers and other militants had attacked the same headquarters in late October, disrupting the initial push into Baiji. ISIS also claimed a truck bombing in Baiji that killed a senior police officer last week. Iraqi troops initially struggled to regain ground from IS after the start of the jihadist offensive. In control: Armed trucks used by ISIS can be seen taking up position near a market in central Mosul, northern Iraq, on Thursday . An ISIS fighter is seen securing a street in central Mosul, the day before Baiji was recaptured by Iraq . With help from US-led air strikes, support from Shiite militias and Sunni tribesmen, assistance from international advisers, and a signficant reshuffling of top officers, Baghdad's forces have begun to make progress. The operation to retake Baiji began more than four weeks ago when security forces and pro-government fighters started advancing towards the town from the south, slowed by bombs militants had planted on the way, and finally entered on October 31. The nearby Baiji refinery once produced some 300,000 barrels of refined petroleum products per day, meeting 50 per cent of the country's needs, but even once it is recaptured, it would take time before it could resume production.","Iraq has recaptured Baiji, 130 miles north of Baghdad, from ISIS .

"Simon Grayson is looking to pull off a notable double when Manchester United visit Preston in the fifth-round of the FA Cup on Monday. Grayson was the manager of Leeds five years ago when they stunned United 1-0 in the third-round, ending a near 30-year wait for a victory at Old Trafford. It is 43 years since Preston have faced the Red Devils and more than 55 years since their last win but, having done it once, Grayson sees no reason why he cannot oversee another shock. Preston boss Simon Grayson is backing his side to shock Manchester United in the FA Cup fifth-round . Jermaine Beckford scored the goal in a famous 1-0 victory for Leed at Old Trafford  back in 2010 . He said: 'Every time I go to Leeds people remind me about it. It's a different football club, different personnel, but I'll draw from the experience and what a great feeling it was to win at Old Trafford that day. 'You don't get the opportunity to do that very often. I want to try to replicate that if possible. You have to have that belief that you can do it.' Leeds' match-winner, Jermaine Beckford, rejoined his old manager on loan from Bolton in November but his chances of more heroics have been scuppered by an ear infection. 'It's affected his balance and he's been having dizzy spells. It actually might make him a little bit brighter and better as a person but he'll be unavailable for the game unfortunately,' said Grayson with a smile. 'It would have been a fantastic fairy tale if he'd been available for us. We were contemplating trying to sign Jonny Howson to find him with a pass!' Not that Preston are short of a goal threat. At 37, Kevin Davies remains a player more than capable of making life uncomfortable for Premier League defences while Paul Gallagher's five goals make him the competition's leading scorer this season. At 37, experienced striker Kevin Davies still knows how to make life awkward for Premier League defences . Preston midfielder Paul Gallagher (left) is actually the FA Cup's top scorer this season with five goals . But it is Joe Garner of whom United will probably be most wary. The 26-year-old has scored 14 times this season, including a brace against Chesterfield on Tuesday on his first start since suffering a shin injury in November. Grayson said: 'He's our talisman and to have him back gave everybody a boost. 'We haven't rushed him back and it's as if he's never been away. He was moaning at me the other night when I took him off with 10 minutes to go because he wanted to get a hat-trick, and that's the mark of a player. 'I'm sure if Manchester United's players are not aware of him at this moment, come Monday night they will be because he ruffles a few feathers.' United and manager Louis van Gaal may be under the microscope over their style of play at the moment but Grayson is well aware there remains a huge gap between the top of League One and the top of the Premier League. After three successive wins, the Lilywhites do not lack confidence, though, and Grayson said of the challenge: 'I think it's got to inspire them. 'You've got to go into a game like this and enjoy it. Our players may never get the chance to play against the likes of Falcao, Rooney, Van Persie etc again. 'The one thing you have to say to them before they go out is have no regrets. We know the task that's against us because of what they are and what they're capable of doing but we've got nothing to lose and they've got everything to lose. 'There's always one shock, there's always a hero, and hopefully it's going to be a Preston North End player.' Joe Garner has scored 14 times this season, including a brace against Chesterfield on Tuesday . Should Preston pull off the upset, it would be fitting timing, with the game coming just two days after the first anniversary of the death of their greatest ever player, Sir Tom Finney. Finney was in the team when North End reached the final in 1954, 16 years after they lifted the trophy for the second and last time. 'This football club has got fantastic history and tradition,' said Grayson. 'It's quite poignant that this weekend is the first anniversary of his death so it would be a fantastic way to mark what he did for this football club.' The Preston boss, meanwhile, is also preparing to take part in a bicycle ride from London to Amsterdam in June in aid of Prostate Cancer UK. Grayson's best friend, Stephen Garbett, died from the disease last September. Preston will have to be at their best if they are to overcome Manchester United's star-studded line-up . Louis van Gaal is targeting FA Cup glory in his first season in charge at Manchester United .

"Not a conspiracy — but it turns out Jose Mourinho may have a point about Chelsea, penalties and Barclays Premier League referees after all. Statistical analysis provided by Opta shows an incredible discrepancy between the number of penalties Chelsea receive in Champions League games and the amount they are awarded in domestic league competition. In seven UEFA fixtures this season, Chelsea have won four penalties, at a rate of one every 1.8 matches. Very high. In the Premier League, this skips to just two penalties in 26 games, at a rate of 13. Jose Mourinho claims that his Chelsea side do not get the refereeing decisions they deserve . Chelsea's Diego Costa appears to get pushed over by Jason Shackell in the recent 1-1 draw with Burnley . Costa looks bemused after Martin Atkinson refuses to award him a penalty after the tussle with Shackell . Chelsea were denied another penalty against Burnley when Branislav Ivanovic's shot hit Michael Kightly's arm . What makes the statistic so curious is that, for the other clubs, the rate at which penalties are won in the Premier League and Champions League barely differs. Manchester City and Liverpool also find it harder to win penalties in the Premier League but only by a variation of 0.2 and 0.5 respectively. Arsenal actually find it almost twice as easy to earn penalties in the Premier League as they do in Europe, but even then the gap between the competitions only equates to 3.3 matches. Yet Chelsea take a whopping 11.2 additional games to win a penalty in the Premier League, compared to their European form. It represents the first corroborative evidence that Mourinho’s fears his team are getting a raw deal may have substance. It makes no sense that the team that has won most Premier League matches, has the best goal difference and ties with Manchester City for the most goals scored, is not picking up as many fouls in the penalty area. Chelsea and Manchester City have both scored 56 league goals this season. That’s a lot of attacking play. Jose Mourinho asked specifically to be a guest on television show Goals on Sunday to air his grievances . Mourinho launched into a 27-minute rant against numerous parties he believed to have wronged Chelsea . Eden Hazard is fouled by Arsenal's Laurent Koscielny, leading to one of Chelsea's two league penalties . Ivanovic is hauled to his feet by West Ham players after going down in the box at Stamford Bridge . Yet while City are awarded a penalty every 3.7 games, such an opportunity for Chelsea comes around once every 13. Maybe Mourinho is aware of this anomaly and it is fuelling his belief that there is a campaign against his team. Those not wrapped in Chelsea blue will still find it hard to believe that there is a conspiracy against the league leaders — who would be behind it and what would be the purpose? Yet, certainly, numbers as illogical as this will merely confirm the feeling at Stamford Bridge that they have been unfairly treated too often this season, and it could cost them with the gap at the top now down to five points. Yes, the margins are small. Had a foul on Diego Costa at Burnley and another on Cesc Fabregas at Southampton been spotted — both players were wrongly booked for diving instead — then Chelsea’s aggregate would have fallen to 6.5 in the league, still high but at least in the ball park. A ratio of 13, however, suggests a flawed process, worthy of conversation between the club and referees’ chief Mike Riley. Something is not right. Not a conspiracy, but without doubt it doesn’t add up. Additional reporting by Barry Bwana . Chelsea have won many more penalties in the Champions League than they have in the Premier League .

"An ugly fight between a husband and wife on a budget airline has caused the aircraft to make an emergency landing in Bali. The fight, on a Scoot aircraft flying from Sydney to Singapore, was so vicious that it is understood the woman received a broken arm while the man suffered facial injuries. In what appeared to be a flight from hell, a third passenger was so intoxicated that the crew were concerned he was a threat to others and he alone would have been a reason for the aircraft diverting and making an emergency landing in Bali. One passenger, Iris Tan, from Sydney, was travelling on TZ1 to Singapore for her cousin’s wedding. A Scoot airlines flight from Sydney to Singapore had to make an emergency landing in Bali after two passengers got in a fight so bad that the woman's arm was broken . She told the MailOnline: 'About an hour into the flight someone asked for medical assistance… about six hours into the flight we got a notification saying we would be landing in Bali,' she said. Iris Tan was sitting in the middle of the plane, so she did not witness the couple fighting, as they were seated in the front of the plane, and only saw the drunk man, who was at the back, when he walked through her compartment to exit the plane. She was unaware a fight had taken place, but was told a medical emergency an hour into the flight meant they would have to stop in Bali. The woman with a broken arm and man attached to a drip were escorted off the plane to meet with an ambulance when the plane landed in Denpasar. When the flight landed, Ms Tan saw the man in his late 30s, with a drip attached to him, who seemed 'quite calm' leave the plane. After half an hour waiting on the tarmac, two Balinese security guards boarded the plane and approached an intoxicated man who looked to be about 19- or 20- years-old. 'He was escorted off the plane and about 15 minutes later he was escorted back on [to collect his belongings] and he was pretty pissed off. He was punching the chairs along the way back to his seat, swearing his head off. 'He said: ""F***, they’re going to kill me! Thanks for killing me!"" 'That caused quite a bit of commotion.’ They were serving alcohol on the flight, but since Scoot is a budget airline, passengers have to purchase any booze they want to consume. A Scoot spokesperson confirmed the separate incidents which had resulted in the emergency landing. 'Flight TZ001 from Sydney to Singapore was diverted to Bali because of a medical emergency. A couple (husband and wife) was, allegedly, physically fighting. The flight made an emergency landing at Bali's Ngurah Rai International airport, where the passengers received medical treatment and talked to police . 'As a result of the altercation, the woman suffered from a suspected broken arm and the man was also injured. Upon arrival in Bali, they were met by an ambulance. 'Separately, a third passenger became intoxicated and was being abusive on-board. 'The Captain offloaded the man because he was deemed to be a threat to the safety of the aircraft and passengers.' The drunk and abusive man was taken off the aircraft by Bali security officers and police. The flight, which departed Sydney airport at 12.40pm, was due to arrive at Changi airport at 6.50pm but did not touch down until almost 10pm. The separate incidents come in the wake of a hijack alert on a Virgin flight last month when a confused man tried to enter the cockpit, believing it was the toilet. Australian plumber Matt Lockley had to be subdued by the crew and was arrested by armed police when the jet touched down in Bali, though police later accepted his explanation that he had made a genuine mistake. Bali airport authorities said the three offloaded passengers had been interviewed by police, but no immediate details were known. The names and nationalities of the passengers have yet to be released. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Flight from Sydney to Singapore forced to land in Bali .

"For a man who really did not want to talk on Saturday evening, Jose Mourinho woke on Sunday having had a serious re-think, invited himself on to Sky Sports and let loose. While admitting he might be talking his way to a touchline ban, the Chelsea manager launched a live verbal assault from his position on the Goals on Sunday sofa, taking aim at various targets which included an attack on Sky’s own coverage. It was very neatly planned and executed by a man employed as an ambassador for rival broadcasters BT Sport, and James Beattie, the show’s scheduled guest, was nowhere to be seen. Jose Mourinho says the incidents  in the 1-1 draw with Burnley were 'clear for everyone, not just me' Mourinho says referees should be given assistance by video technology if they can't get decisions right . 'Mourinho is wrong to imply an orchestrated campaign, but entitled to ask questions. His players, fine players, are frequently under siege.' Click HERE to read Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel on Jose Mourinho's Goals on Sunday appearance . Mourinho has bemoaned these things for weeks but Burnley striker Ashley Barnes and referee Martin Atkinson pushed him over the edge as Chelsea dropped precious points in a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. He lashed out at Barnes, branding his tackle on Nemanja Matic ‘criminal’ and ‘career-ending’ and recalled for the audience a seven-match ban imposed on the striker two years ago when he tripped a referee while playing for Brighton against Bolton. And he called for more technology to help officials who ‘can’t see a penalty three metres in front of him’ and claimed Chelsea were ‘not getting the respect they deserve’ with a long sequence of bad decisions. It was an incredible performance, even by Mourinho standards of showmanship and revolved around his four chosen moments from the Burnley game: two failed penalty appeals and two challenges by Barnes. ‘What can I say that everybody doesn’t know?’ the Chelsea manager began. ‘Sometimes there is space for discussion where you have one view and I have another, but I can’t believe these four incidents are open to interpretation. This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Nemanja Matic and Mourinho backed up his player . Matic's reaction to Barnes's tackle earned the Serbian a red card - he'll now miss the Capital One Cup final . Mourinho shot from the lip during his surprise appearance on Goals on Sunday on Sky Sports . ‘At half-time Burnley should be playing with 10 men and Chelsea should have had two penalties and be winning 3-0, or let’s say 2-0 if we miss one of the penalties. The reality is that in the end we end the game with 10 men and we lose two points.’ The first penalty appeal was for handball when a shot by Branislav Ivanovic crashed into Michael Kightly’s outstretched arm. ‘The arm stopped the ball hitting the target,’ said Mourinho. ‘He’s far away; it’s not one metre, not a few inches, it’s quite far. Players should be taught to keep balance even in difficult situations, making difficult bio-mechanical actions and putting their arms behind the body to avoid this. For me, this is a penalty everywhere. ‘The best players in the world make mistakes, they miss penalties, and this gentleman is one of the top referees in this country and Europe and he can also make mistakes. He made four important mistakes. It is consistent but we must search for consistency in the right way. The lawyer who has lost 15 cases out of 15 is consistent but you don’t want that lawyer.’ The second penalty appeal was for a push by Jason Shackell on Costa, but Mourinho went back to the opening game of the Barclays Premier League campaign when his centre forward was booked for a dive at Turf Moor. Mourinho requested to go on Goals on Sunday and planned guest James Beattie had to make way . Atkinson, the referee for Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley, was criticised for his decisions on Saturday . ‘The penalty story with Diego Costa started on day one, because it is a penalty and a red card for the goalkeeper,’ he said. ‘Michael Oliver — also one of the top referees in the country and soon to be one of the best in Europe — gives a yellow card to Diego and a free-kick against Chelsea.’ During the course of this 29-minute section of the show, he noted other penalties his team deserved but did not get — against Everton, Southampton, Liverpool and Tottenham — and insisted only once had he benefited from a dubious decision, when Gary Cahill escaped a handball at Liverpool. ‘Probably I am risking my place in the dug-out in the final because I risk being suspended by having this conversation in a studio,’ Mourinho went on. ‘I know in football sometimes you get them and sometimes you don’t but it’s too much. I try to be calm and controlled but my players are not getting the respect they deserve.’ When it came to analysing the Barnes challenges, one on Ivanovic and one on Matic, which provoked his dismissal for a retaliatory shove, the Chelsea manager said: ‘This Burnley player involved in two actions has a grey past. There was a very dark point in his career when he was at Brighton and suspended for seven matches, because of a big incident with a referee. Mourinho appeared to be agitated during the game too, airing his frustrations to media after the match . The Chelsea boss was particularly unhappy with the performance of referee Atkinson . ‘Should this player be chased because of what he did in the past? I don’t think so. When people look at these two incidents I hope they only see these two incidents. I don’t think it should have any relation with his history. ‘When I see Diego Costa on day one in the Premier League, penalty and red card to the goalkeeper, game over 2-0, transformed into a free-kick and yellow for Costa, I think he has changed country but brought with him his past in the eyes of the officials. This is clearly not fair. ‘When I finish the game against Liverpool and go to the dressing room, the first thing I see on the big screen we have in the dressing room is about Diego Costa’s ‘crimes’. Well, I would like to know how Sky Sports describe the actions of the Burnley player yesterday when you call what Diego Costa did a crime.’ With his sidekick Chris Kamara struck by temporary paralysis beside him, Sky host Ben Shephard admitted there may have been a mistake with the language in the immediate aftermath of Costa’s stamp on Emre Can, in the Capital One Cup semi-final, which prompted a three-match ban. Mourinho covered a range of subjects during his appearance on Goals on Sunday . ‘Did you apologise to Chelsea or to Diego or to me as Chelsea manager?’ asked Mourinho. ‘You did not. You never apologised. I don’t like the use of language and don’t like it that immediately there is public judgment. ‘You give no space to the people who have to decide. The pressure was so much that it gave no space and you don’t do this with every club and every player. When you say Diego’s “crimes” because he put his foot on another man you have to say this is a criminal tackle, minimum. When Diego Costa had a three-match ban, tell me how many matches you think this player deserves. ‘What happened was similar to what happened to Eden Hazard at Stoke but I would say yesterday was worse because this was “end of career”, I can’t find an adjective any stronger than to say “end of career”. Matic is a lucky guy. I can’t find words to describe what that player did. ‘Matic had reason to lose his emotions. What are the consequences of Matic’s push on the other player? Nothing. One second later, he stands and goes. The consequence for Matic could be the end of career.’ Mourinho did not appear satisfied with a post-match conversation he had with Atkinson at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. ‘I am not attacking the honesty of anyone,’ he added. ‘I am not trying to bring the game into disrepute — a sentence you love in this country because this is always what they use when they want to punish me. I’m just trying to be honest. ‘Of course, they are trying but they are not doing it well. If the ref can’t see a penalty three metres in front of him some referee in front of a screen can’t miss it. It will protect the integrity and honesty of the referees. I think technology can help.’ Mourinho stuck around with Shephard and Kamara to analyse the rest of the Saturday action but by then he had got what he wanted to off his chest. 30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back.

"Louis van Gaal shouldn't have to defend his Manchester United side's perceived lack of entertainment value, says club legend Peter Schmeichel, as long as the boss gets results. United's style under the Dutch manager has been described as 'long-ball', especially after their 1-1 draw with Sam Allardyce's West Ham. Paul Scholes called it 'miserable' while former boss Tommy Docherty feared Van Gaal was alienating fans. But Schmeichel believes the criticism is unfair even if the style is at odds with what would have been expected given Van Gaal's reputation from his time at the likes of Ajax and Bayern Munich.

'I don't mind a different style of play, or a boring style, for a limited period, because what I want most of all is the club back to winning ways and believing they can win,' Schmeichel told The Sun. 'It's important for the players to start understanding how much better it is to feel like you can win.' Schmeichel, who won the Champions League, five Premier Leagues and three FA Cups in goal for the Red Devils, says the side has 'progressed' from where they were last year and despite a loss last time out against Swansea they are now genuine contenders for the top four. After finishing seventh last campaign under David Moyes, Van Gaal's United are fourth in the Premier League with Arsenal a point ahead in third and Southampton one point behind.

And while catching Chelsea (13 points ahead) and Manchester City (eight points) is probably too much to ask, a return to Europe's top club competition next season as part of the Premier League's top four is realistic. United host Sunderland on Saturday on the back of a disappointing loss to Swansea. They face a Black Cats side struggling after draws with Swansea and West Brom either side of losses to QPR in the league and League One Bradford in the FA Cup.","Louis van Gaal's Manchester United have been labelled 'boring'
