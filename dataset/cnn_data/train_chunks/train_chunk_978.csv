"Stuart Lancaster’s preparation for the 2015 Rugby World Cup has even extended to staging meetings with his players’ partners as well as their agents. England’s coach has handed every player a detailed dossier explaining his plans for them over the next year, specifying when he wants them to rest so they peak for the start of the tournament next September. But Lancaster has chosen to include wives and girlfriends in those plans, calling them to a meeting at the team hotel to explain the demands that will be put on partners.

VIDEO Lancaster: England will be ready for Rugby World Cup . Lancaster’s mantra is that they are ‘all in this together’ in a bid to win the World Cup, with the added pressure of being tournament hosts. He also felt it important to have it explained to the players’ partners that they, too, could come under greater scrutiny — not least from the media — in the build-up to the tournament; a lesson the England football team learned at the 2006 World Cup. The players’ agents and representatives met Lancaster at Twickenham, where they were told they are now regarded as part of the wider England operation.

Lancaster stressed the need to make preparation for the World Cup a priority before pursuing any commercial deals for players. Lancaster has banned newspaper columns and video diaries for the duration of the World Cup but wants a collective commitment to the cause to go way beyond that. It is understood he used one particular player as an illustration of what he expects — the player having delayed his wedding until 2016 so that his focus for next year remains on the tournament. All the players have been told they must have a three-week rest next summer as part of the programme geared towards delivering England in the best possible condition for that opening game against Fiji at Twickenham on September 18. ‘Stuart’s attention to detail is second to none,’ one insider has told Sportsmail. ‘You look at the stuff the players have been given and it tells them when to go to bed, when to rest, the need for a three-week break at the end of this season; it’s all designed to ensure they peak at the right time. ‘But the wives and girlfriends and the agents were called in to make sure that everyone is on the same page; that everyone understands that trying to win the World Cup is what the next year is all about.’","England coach Stuart Lancaster has given each player a detailed dossier explaining their plans for the next year .

"Harlequins boss Conor O'Shea is relishing another tilt at major French opposition when the new European Rugby Champions Cup kicks off on Friday night. The 20-team tournament, formed earlier this year following months of wrangling and often bitter argument, replaces the Heineken Cup as European club rugby prepares for its 20th successive season. And Quins will get the ball rolling, hosting 2013 French champions and 2014 runners-up Castres at Twickenham Stoop. Harlequins Director of Rugby Conor O'Shea during the European Rugby Launch at Twickenham Stoop . Although Quins are currently outside the Aviva Premiership's top half, Castres only have two teams below them in the Top 14 and are 16 points behind leaders Clermont Auvergne after losing six of their opening nine league games. But O'Shea said: 'It's pretty frightening. They might have had an inconsistent start to the season, but they are a brilliant side. 'They are Top 14 champions and finalists over the past two years, so what a massive game to start it off. It's going to be ferocious. 'The game will be decided by the little things that happen within the match. If they go our way, we will win and everyone will say we're great, and if they don't, we will lose and everyone will say we're terrible and Castres are great. Harlequins prop Joe Marler has not had the easiest start to life as club captain this season . 'That's how tight this is. Top-level sport is about margins, and if you work hard enough the margins go your way. 'We haven't been consistent at the start of the season, but we will hit form and, when we do, we can match anybody. 'We always like playing the French sides because they play rugby, they try and attack. 'People have this turgid view of the Top 14, but they don't (play like that), especially Castres. We've played them a few times in pre-season over the years and we know the threats they have. This will be a great challenge for us.' Matt Hopper of Quins looks on in the rain against Leicester Tigers on Friday night . O'Shea has made three changes to the side beaten by Leicester last Friday, with centre George Lowe replacing Tom Casson, scrum-half Danny Care returning after his partner gave birth to the couple's first child, and hooker Dave Ward is in for Joe Gray. Castres, meanwhile, will be spearheaded by their outstanding half-back combination of skipper Remi Tales and Rory Kockott, with Scotland internationals Max Evans and Richie Gray also in the starting line-up. 'There will be a lot attention on the game and it's going to be exciting for everyone at the club,' O'Shea added. 'It's a great tournament. Now that it is here and back again, everyone's delighted. Nick Easter of Harlequins wins line-out ball during last weekend's defeat at Welford Road . 'It is a massive emotional rollercoaster and you have to be very level the whole way through, but it doesn't get much tougher to start with.' Elsewhere, the second-tier European Rugby Challenge Cup continues on Friday night with Newcastle hosting Bucharest Wolves and Edinburgh visiting in-form Begles-Bordeaux. Newcastle show 14 changes following their league win against London Welsh last weekend, with full-back Lee Smith, centres Tom Penny and Chris Harris and wing Tom Catterick all making their first starts of the season, while there are opportunities up-front for lock Will Witty and flanker Dan Temm.","Quins kick off their European campaign against French opposition .

"Sam Burgess has been told he risked serious eye damage by playing for nearly 80 minutes with a double facial fracture in Sunday’s NRL Grand Final and could have jeopardised his chances of featuring in the rugby union World Cup. The Bath-bound player — hailed a ‘modern-day gladiator’ for refusing to leave the field following a sickening clash of heads with an opponent — had surgery in Sydney on Tuesday, when he had a metal plate inserted into his face to repair a fractured cheekbone and eye socket. His recovery is expected to take ‘several months’, which will leave him less than nine months from his first game of professional rugby union until the start of next year’s World Cup. Sam Burgess (left)  played on with a suspected broken cheekbone for South Sydney in the NRL Grand Final . Burgess went on to win the Clive Churchill Medal (left) man of the match before getting his hand on the trophy . On Tuesday night, Burgess’s courage was called into question by former rugby-league great Dr George Peponis, who is now a GP. ‘He was courageous because he stayed on with a fractured eye socket or cheekbone, whatever it was,’ Peponis said. ‘However, if he got another bad knock on that eye socket it could’ve done some more serious damage, it could’ve been further depressed and caused some damage to his muscles around the eye. Thankfully, luckily, none of that happened.’ Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe (left) hugs Burgess (right) after the club's first premiership win in 43 years .

South Sydney Rabbitohs owner, film star Russell Crowe, said Burgess’s heroism had seen him carve his name ‘deep into rugby league history’ following his man-of-the-match display in his final game for the Sydney club. But England head coach Stuart Lancaster, and his Bath counterpart Mike Ford, will be more concerned with the 25-year-old missing a large part of the Aviva Premiership following a deal to bring him to union worth close to £500,000. Lancaster is facing an increasingly lengthy injury list which has already seen four players ruled out of the autumn internationals while there is growing concern that Tom Croft’s knee problem could be worse than the club are prepared to admit.

"Premiership Rugby chiefs have confirmed changes to the league's salary cap from next season. As expected, the base salary cap level will rise to £5.1million, plus £400,000 in home-grown player credits. This season's salary cap is set at £5million. Each Premiership club will additionally be able to nominate up to two 'excluded players' whose salary is not included in the cap. The changes were confirmed following a meeting on Wednesday of Premiership Rugby's chairman and shareholder group. Premiership clubs can already nominate one so-called 'marquee player' in their squad, whose wages are excluded from the salary cap constraints. Teams such as Premiership champions Northampton will be better able to keep their top local talent in England after changes to salary cap restrictions, announced on Wednesday . For the 2015-16 campaign, a second marquee player can be recruited who is new to Premiership rugby next term and has not played in the competition for at least 12 months. The home-grown player credits, meanwhile, apply to players who joined a club academy before their 18th birthday and have been with the club for more than two years. Premiership Rugby chief executive Mark McCafferty said the rise in the salary cap is a reflection of the increased revenues for the code . Premiership Rugby say the emphasis is on further increasing the number of Premiership home-grown players. 'We are delighted to confirm the number of England-qualified players in Aviva Premiership rugby has passed 70 per cent for the first time, and we want to drive the numbers even higher,' Premiership Rugby chief executive Mark McCafferty said. 'The increase in the base level of the salary cap will help our clubs to retain English talent. 'Also, the introduction of home-grown player credits helps the enviable production line that has been established from our academies to our Premiership squads and on to England. 'England and their clubs are getting stronger because of our commitment to the development of world-class England players in Aviva Premiership rugby. It is an essential part of our league and the strength of our system.' Explaining Premiership Rugby's thinking, McCafferty added: 'The level of the salary cap is linked to central revenues which have increased significantly in recent years as a result of a new broadcast partner in BT Sport, new European revenues and the recent contract signed with our title sponsor Aviva. 'This increase in central revenues has allowed us to increase the salary cap and further help our clubs compete in both the new European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup.' Speaking on Tuesday, Harlequins rugby director Conor O'Shea said English clubs needed extra buying power to retain leading players post-2015 World Cup. Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea said clubs needed more spending power to compete with the likes of France and Japan, whose budgets are ever-increasing . 'I think there is little alternative really, and there are some important changes,' O'Shea said. 'Wages are accelerating all the time in France and Japan, and we want to keep home-grown players at home for as long as possible. 'These cap increases, yes they will allow us to improve squads, but they also won't give you too much leeway to make huge amendments to your squad. 'Hopefully, it will allow us just to keep competitive the whole time, retain what you've got and develop the young English players that don't stay for free.'","The salary cap has been raised from £5million to £5.1million for 2015 .

"Leicester slumped to a three-year low in the Aviva Premiership after they experienced another west country horror show just two weeks after being blitzed 45-0 by Bath. Gloucester were the beneficiaries of another dreadful Tigers display, cutting loose to claim a 33-16 victory that was based on first-half tries by Nick Wood, Charlie Sharples and Jonny May. It was the first time since October 2011 for Leicester to suffer three successive Premiership defeats - they were beaten at home by London Irish seven days ago - and they look to be nowhere near halting an alarming early-season slump. Gloucester's Rob Cook (centre) gets past Leicester's Owen Williams and leaves him on the floor . Scotland international Greig Laidlaw kicked 18 points from four penalties and three conversions, while Leicester could only muster an Owen Williams penalty hat-trick and his conversion of an injury-time David Mele try after Tigers were out-thought and outplayed. Gloucester were sharper in attack, more physical up-front and much cleverer through their support work, which combined to leave Leicester boss Richard Cockerill assessing major problems ahead of hosting Harlequins next Friday, which is followed by a European Champions Cup opener against Ulster. Not even edging the second-half scoreline 7-3 will have lifted Tigers' spirits, as it did nothing to paper over alarming cracks. Gloucester showed three changes from the side that beat London Welsh last time out, with Laidlaw, Wood and lock Tom Savage all featuring, but injury-hit Leicester were forced into a late change. Already without England quintet Manu Tuilagi, Tom Youngs, Dan Cole, Geoff Parling and Tom Croft, centre Seremaia Bai was ruled out due to calf muscle trouble, so former Gloucester fly-half Freddie Burns - who was initially named on the bench - started, and Williams moved from 10 to 12. Scotland international Greig Laidlaw kicked 18 points from four penalties and three conversions . Williams and Laidlaw exchanged early penalties before Laidlaw's second successful strike nudged Gloucester 6-3 ahead after the home side went close to a try, but were denied by Tigers wing Miles Benjamin's ankle-tap tackle on full-back Rob Cook. Referee Andrew Small continued to award penalties at frequent intervals, and Laidlaw completed his hat-trick after just 12 minutes before Williams narrowed the gap to 9-6, but Gloucester quickly tightened their grip. Burns, who had been given a vociferous homecoming by the Gloucester supporters, gave the home crowd more ammunition when he saw an attempted defensive clearance charged down by Savage, who then gathered the bounce and fed a supporting Wood for Gloucester's opening try. Laidlaw converted as Gloucester opened up a 10-point lead and alarm bells started ringing throughout a Leicester team depleted by another injury blow when full-back Mathew Tait groggily left the action to be replaced by Matt Smith, and Blaine Scully switched from wing to Tigers' last line of defence. Gloucester did not escape on the injury front, though, as their captain and England centre Billy Twelvetrees departed after suffering what appeared to be a knock to his leg. Things then continued to unravel for Leicester as they found themselves horribly exposed in defence when Sharples was freed in space, and the England wing effortlessly went around Vereniki Goneva before cutting inside Scully for a superb solo try that Laidlaw converted. Leicester, not for the first time this season, looked in a state of disarray, and although Williams kicked a third penalty just before half-time, Gloucester delivered a third try that owed everything to slick midfield passing. Leicester Tigers Ben Youngs (left) hands off Gloucester's Matt Kvesic . Fly-half James Hook, watched from the stands by Wales head coach Warren Gatland and assistant Rob Howley, set the score up by drawing his marker superbly, before Cook gave a scoring pass to May and Leicester were again unlocked. Laidlaw's successful touchline conversion rubbed salt into a gaping Tigers wound, and at 30-9 down Leicester faced a Herculean second-half task to avoid fresh humiliation two weeks after they were thumped by Bath. Leicester showed a greater appetite for the battle during the third quarter, yet they could not break down Gloucester's defence, and after the home side absorbed a spell of pressure, Laidlaw's fourth penalty took his team 24 points clear following a superb Hook break. Goneva then received a yellow card for a shoulder charge on Sharples, although referee Small missed a dangerous tackle by Benjamin in the same phase of play, and Gloucester looked to ram home their superiority with a temporary one-man advantage by establishing a firm foothold deep inside Tigers territory. They missed a golden opportunity when replacement scrum-half Dan Robson got in Sharples' way with the Leicester line beckoning, but the Tigers had long since been beaten and Gloucester could celebrate their best performance of the season, despite seeing Mele scamper over during the dying seconds.","Gloucester benefit from terrible Leicester display in dominant win .

"Gloucester captain Billy Twelvetrees has urged his team to cut out 'silly mistakes' ahead of Friday night's Aviva Premiership clash against rock-bottom London Welsh. Twelvetrees and company head to the Kassam Stadium after being beaten by Northampton and Exeter, while it required an impressive fightback from 17-3 adrift before they saw off Kingsholm visitors Sale Sharks a fortnight ago. A new-look Gloucester squad is inevitably taking time to knit together, but Twelvetrees is not unduly troubled and believes that early-season teething troubles can easily be fixed. Gloucester captain Billy Twelvetrees wants a clinical display from his side against London Welsh on Friday . 'It's a simple game,' he said. 'It's about getting over the gain-line, working hard for each other and picking the right options. 'When you don't pick the right options in defence or attack, make poor decisions at the breakdown and give penalties away, you are suddenly behind on the scoreboard. 'We have to cut that out, and from (numbers) 1-15 we're not good enough at doing that at the moment. But you can also look at it as a positive because if we cut these silly mistakes out we will be there or thereabouts and performing well. 'Good teams are very disciplined in all areas of the park, whether that's in giving away penalties or when to play the ball and when not to play the ball. 'We have to get up to speed on that and the way we play the game, and we will get the results when that comes. 'We are putting teams under stress. We scored three tries (against Exeter) and we are probably not where we want to be in attack, but we have that belief and it's just about doing the right things.' Gloucester boss David Humphreys has made four changes for the trip to Oxford, with scrum-half Dan Robson, lock Elliott Stooke and flanker Matt Kvesic all making their first starts this term, while John Afoa returns at tighthead prop. Under-performing Gloucester players trudge off the pitch following their 25-23 defeat to Exeter Chiefs . London Welsh also show four switches, including one personnel move, as they look to break their duck after conceding 151 points in losing to Exeter, Bath and Sale. Centre Tom May and wing Rhys Crane are the respective replacements for injured pair Tim Molenaar (knee) and Seb Stegmann (hamstring), while Ollie Stedman starts at number eight and Lachlan McCaffrey features in the blindside flanker's role with Peter Browne absent through injury. 'The first few games have been really tough for us, and we've got some obvious errors to rectify,' Exiles head coach Justin Burnell said. 'As a group, the coaches, management and players all felt our performance in our first home game of the season against Exeter was unacceptable - we let a lot of people down. We will be looking to address that on Friday.'","Gloucester face London Welsh in the Aviva Premiership on Friday .

"Gloucester staged a storming second-half fightback at Kingsholm to ignite their Aviva Premiership campaign after an opening day debacle against champions Northampton. The west country club, smashed 53-6 by Saints, trailed Sale 17-6 at half-time after the Sharks ran in tries by wing Tom Arscott, scrum-half Chris Cusiter and full-back Luke McLean. Danny Cipriani had run the show for Sale, playing a creative role in all three touchdowns, but Gloucester were transformed after the break as wing Jonny May and full-back Rob Cook scored tries prior to a late penalty try, while scrum-half Greig Laidlaw kicked 19 points in a 34-27 victory. Yann Thomas and Henry Trinder of Gloucester celebrate a try against Sale Sharks in a 34-27 win . Henry Trinder of Gloucester is tackled by Will Addison of Sale Sthe Aviva Premiership match . It was rough justice on Cipriani especially, who also slotted two conversions and a penalty and claimed a late touchdown that secured two losing bonus points, yet Sale now go into next Saturday's home game against London Welsh having lost their first two league fixtures. New-look Gloucester were at sixes and sevens for most of the opening period as they looked to shake off any lingering effects of a Franklin's Gardens hangover, and Sale did not require a second invitation to compound their misery. Cipriani set up Arscott for an opening try inside two minutes, then further fine work created the attacking spark that enabled Cusiter and then McLean to prosper. There appeared no way back for Gloucester, given Sale's dominance, yet a combination of Scotland international Laidlaw's impressive accuracy and May's elusiveness sunk the Sharks. Ben Morgan of Gloucester touches down for a try as his pack drive the Sale Sharks scrum over the try line . James Hook supported by Jonny May of Gloucester takes on Mark Easter of Sale Sharks at Kingsholm . Gloucester paraded all their major summer signings for Premiership home debuts while Sale handed a first start to Georgian hooker Shalva Mamukashvili in a team captained by flanker David Seymour, as they targeted an immediate riposte after losing at home against Bath seven days ago. And the visitors made a sparkling start, going ahead through a well-executed try that had its origins in poor Gloucester lineout work. Wales hooker Richard Hibbard's overthrow allowed Sale an attacking platform and Cipriani's cleverly-placed kick was gathered by Arscott, who comfortably brushed off tame Gloucester defensive efforts. Cipriani failed to land the touchline conversion attempt, but Sale were on their way despite lock Nathan Hines' early departure through injury, while Gloucester saw flanker Jacob Rowan carried off during the initial flurries. Cipriani was in the thick of things again after Sale absorbed a lengthy spell of Gloucester pressure, backing himself to gather his own kick ahead on halfway and sending a supporting Cusiter sprinting over for an outstanding try. The former England fly-half's conversion made it 12-0 midway through the first period, and there was worse to come for Gloucester as Sale extended their advantage before half-time. Rob Cook of Gloucester touches down in the corner for a try despite the tackle of Tom Brady of Sale Sharks . Gloucester tried to attack through wing May, but when the move broke down and referee Greg Garner penalised the home side, Cipriani again reacted quickest as he eyed space before wing Tom Brady's inside ball allowed McLean a clear run. Two Laidlaw penalties sandwiched the McLean touchdown and Gloucester could have few complaints as they trooped off 17-6 adrift, having conceded 11 tries in just 120 minutes of Premiership rugby this term. The home side were transformed straight after half-time, though, as 11 points in nine dominant minutes hauled them level. Laidlaw added two more penalties, then centre Henry Trinder kicked ahead for livewire May to capitalise on acres of space for a try that put Gloucester on level terms. Sale looked shell-shocke, and they suddenly had it all to do after dominating the first half through Cipriani's excellence. A long-range Cipriani penalty edged Sale back in front, but their defence was unlocked again 16 minutes from time when May turned provider and Cook finished off wide out. Laidlaw's superb touchline conversion opened up a four-point advantage, and then he sealed the deal with a later penalty - his fifth - before he converted a penalty try following relentless scrum pressure to get Gloucester's season up and running, although Cipriani deservedly had the last word when he converted his own try.","Gloucester came from 17-6 down at half-time to beat Sale Sharks 34-27 .

"Exeter moved top of the Aviva Premiership after goalkickers Gareth Steenson and Henry Slade combined to punish Gloucester's poor discipline at Kingsholm. Fly-half Steenson landed four penalties and a conversion of flanker Ben White's first-half try, while Slade capped an impressive individual performance by booting two long-range strikes as Exeter triumphed 25-22 to make it two wins out of three this term and climb one point above unbeaten trio Saracens, Bath and Leicester. Gloucester dominated early on through tries from wing Jonny May and prop Dan Murphy, but they handed Steenson and Slade regular opportunities to punish them, which they gratefully accepted.

Exeter's Gareth Steenson lines up a conversion during the Aviva Premiership match at Kingsholm Stadium . The cherry and whites have so far leaked an average of 35 points and four tries per game during new rugby director David Humphreys' reign, and although it is early days for a new-look squad, a losing bonus point secured by flanker Sione Kalamafoni's touchdown will provide scant consolation. Half-backs Greig Laidlaw and James Hook each added a conversion, while Hook slotted a late penalty, yet Exeter kept their composure as the clock ticked down, following up a landslide opening weekend win at London Welsh with another away victory. Gloucester huffed and puffed during the stamina-sapping closing stages in an attempt to salvage the contest, but Exeter confirmed their reputation as a solid Premiership outfit through a thoroughly-professional performance. Gloucester showed four changes from the side that accounted for Sale Sharks six days ago, with centre Henry Purdy making his Premiership debut instead of an injured Henry Trinder, while prop Sila Puafisi replaced John Afoa, lock Tom Palmer took over from James Hudson and Ross Moriarty packed down in the back-row. Exeter boss Rob Baxter, meanwhile, handed starts to prop Ben Moon and lock Damian Welch as the solitary starting XV changes following a narrow home defeat against Leicester last time out. The Chiefs won last season's corresponding fixture 29-12, with Steenson kicking 19 points, and it took him just three minutes to open his account this time around, landing an angled penalty after Gloucester infringed inside their own half. Exeter Chiefs' Damian Welch is tackled by Gloucester's Ben Morgan and Richard Hibbard . Gloucester and Wales hooker Richard Hibbard makes a break during the Friday night match . But Gloucester hit back quickly after Exeter wing Iain Whitten was sin-binned for a mid-air challenge on opposite number Charlie Sharples, with May proving the home side's attacking magician. Put into space just inside his own half, he won a thrilling race to ground his own kick, getting to the touchdown inches before May's opposite number Matt Jess, who made a valiant attempt to thwart the danger. And Exeter were in trouble again shortly afterwards, failing to regroup quickly enough after scrum-half Haydn Thomas went off injured as Gloucester's forwards drove relentlessly from a lineout before Murphy claimed a try that Laidlaw converted. A second Steenson penalty narrowed the gap to 12-6 after 15 minutes before Whitten returned, before two further Steenson strikes in six minutes tied things up as he made it 14 successful kicks from 14 attempts this term. That 100 per cent record then ended, though, when he drifted a long-range penalty attempt just short as Gloucester continued to encounter scrummaging problems, with Murphy under particular pressure. Henry Slade attempts to tackle Elliott Stooke of Gloucester as the hosts attempt a comeback . Gloucester full back Rob Cook is tackled by Chiefs wing Ian Whitten . Gloucester's early zip and promise had evaporated, and Exeter did not require a second invitation to establish a commanding advantage by half-time. Superb approach work by back-row forwards Thomas Waldrom and Dave Ewers set up a close-range score for White that Steenson converted as Exeter went in front for the first time, then a Slade penalty made it 22-12 at the break as Gloucester trooped off with plenty to contemplate. And it almost got even worse for the home side after Slade scythed through Gloucester's midfield defence before replacement scrum-half Will Chudley kicked on and touched down, but referee Matt Carley ruled a forward pass by Slade after consulting with television match official Geoff Warren. Gloucester then had substitute Matt Kvesic harshly yellow-carded for what Carley ruled was a dangerous tackle on the charging Waldrom, and Slade hit the target from just inside Gloucester's half to open up a 13-point Exeter lead. Exeter preserved that lead until into the final quarter, but Kalamafoni's 63rd-minute touchdown, converted by Hook, set up a gripping finale as Gloucester moved to within striking distance. Hook's 72nd-minute penalty gave Exeter further cause for concern as pressure began to mount, but they had done just enough to frustrate their opponents and reach the early-season Premiership summit.

"The Victoria Cross and George Cross Association has given its backing to a controversial new England kit that incorporates the Victoria Cross emblem within its design. The Rugby Football Union apologised on Wednesday 'to those who may have taken offence' over new Canterbury-manufactured shirts - the traditional white jersey and a crimson alternate shirt - featuring Victoria Cross motifs that comprise numerous small rubber grips to help deaden the impact of the ball. Victoria Cross Trust chairman Gary Stapleton criticised the RFU for having had no contact with the organisation over using the emblem, claiming it had 'touched a raw nerve with a lot of people'. The Victoria Cross, the British and Commonwealth armed forces' most prestigious medal, has only been awarded 1,354 times during its 158-year existence, most recently in 2012. England players wear the new England rugby home kit, which has caused controversy over its design . England's players model the alternative red kit they will wear, with Victoria Cross design on the top half . The new white shirt will be worn for the first time when England kick off their autumn Test schedule by hosting world champions New Zealand at Twickenham on November 8. But the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association, which was established 52 years ago, has now issued a statement saying it is 'pleased' that the motif has been used. 'Although the Association was not previously aware of the RFU's decision to incorporate the motif, following discussions between the Association and the RFU (and taking account of the statement issued by the RFU) it is clear that the RFU did not intend to cause any offence,' Association chairman-elect Major Peter Norton GC said, in the statement. 'Strong links have always existed between the game of rugby and the military. 'The RFU's core values of teamwork, respect, enjoyment, discipline and sportsmanship sit well with the military's core values of loyalty, integrity, courage, discipline, respect and selfless commitment. 'Given that we, as a nation, are now commemorating the centenary of the First World War, and the sacrifices made by so many during that period, the Association feels that the RFU's decision to incorporate a Victoria Cross-inspired motif within the design of the new England shirt is a subtle, and fitting, mark of respect for those who went above and beyond.' Geoff Parling wearing the new England home kit, a uniform now mired in controversy . The England rose badge has moved from the left, pictured, to the centre of their shirts . 'We wish to thank the RFU for this, and for their continued support for the Armed Forces, past, present and future.' Speaking earlier this week for the Victoria Cross Trust, which is not affiliated to the VC and GC Association, Stapleton said: 'Using that symbol, you have got to look at it in what context. 'In the context that they (RFU) are making money off the selling of the shirts, that's highly inappropriate. 'If, for example, they were publicly stating they were supporting the work of the Victoria Cross Trust and to recognise the bravery of the men that they were going to place the symbol on their shirts for the season and a percentage of the sale of the shirts would go to the Trust, that would be appropriate. 'To that end, I don't think anyone would have had an issue with it.' England head coach Stuart Lancaster, meanwhile, has drawn heavily on England's rich rugby history to instil a stronger sense of national pride throughout his tenure as head coach. Lancaster created the Arthur Harrison Award, where England coaches select a winner after every match for the player producing the best defensive performance. Harrison is England's only rugby international to be awarded the Victoria Cross, bestowed posthumously after he lost his life in the Zeebrugge raid of April 1918 in the First World War.

"Scotland international Ruaridh Jackson could be out for the season after suffering a serious knee injury during Wasps' Aviva Premiership victory over Northampton last Sunday. Wasps have announced that the 26-year-old has suffered an anterior cruciate ligament tear, will require surgery and is likely to be sidelined for between six and nine months. Jackson, who has won 25 Scotland caps, joined Wasps from Glasgow this summer. Ruaridh Jackson could miss six to nine months with Wasps and Scotland due to a serious knee injury . 'We are all incredibly disappointed for Ruaridh, who has made such an impact since joining Wasps this season,' Wasps rugby director Dai Young said. 'He has impressed me during training, both with his skill level and his attitude, and it's a real blow to lose him after he played so well in pre-season and when he came on against Northampton last Sunday. 'Our medical team will be monitoring Ruaridh carefully and supporting him through this frustrating period. London Wasps players celebrate a try in their Aviva Premiership win over Northampton on Sunday . 'Professional sport is cruel at times, and this is certainly one of those times. 'Alex Lozowski will now have an opportunity to impress over the next few weeks, alongside Andy Goode, while we also have the option of playing Rob Miller at fly-half.' Jackson made his Test debut against New Zealand in 2010.

"Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen says Wales have not been affected by uncertainty surrounding the venue for next week's opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Andorra. The Football Association of Wales said on Wednesday that the game would take place as planned at Andorra's new National Stadium, where a recently-laid 3G artificial surface attracted close scrutiny from UEFA officials. 'UEFA has confirmed that the match will go ahead in Andorra after the 3G pitch was given the green light,' the FAW posted on its official website. No concern: Joe says Wales have not been affected over the uncertainty surrounding Andorra's pitch . Plans were in place to switch the game to Barcelona had the surface failed final checks, but the go-ahead has now been given just six days before Wales' Euro 2016 kick-off. 'It doesn't matter what pitch we play on, whatever surface, our focus on is how we play and perform,' Allen said. 'We have got to be confident whatever happens - we are there to get three points, and we have got to make sure that's what we do. 'We would prefer to play on grass, that's what we do week in week out and it's an obvious preference. 'But we've all played on artificial surfaces enough times to know what to expect from it, and it's not a problem. 'It's not been an ideal situation not knowing where we were playing the game. It's been more of an issue for fans with their travel arrangements, and you feel for them. Star billing: Gareth Bale (right) and Aaron Ramsey train with Wales at the Cardiff City Stadium . Ball inspection: Bale inspects a football during training ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier at Andorra . Happy times: Bale sees the funny side in the run up to the start of the Euro 2016 qualifiers . 'But as a squad it's not something we've talked about too much. It's not been affecting our preparations and we will get on with it.' Wales will not train on a 3G surface before tackling the Group B minnows next Tuesday, but they should encounter few problems - either with the pitch or their opponents. And a strong start would set them up nicely for next month's successive home games against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus. 'It is a huge tournament, and we can't wait to get the campaign under way,' Allen added. Leading the way: Bale runs in front of the Wales squad during a jog around the stadium . Kicking practice: Bale was back in Cardiff for the first time since winning the UEFA Super Cup with Real Madrid . 'It sounds obvious to say it, but the start is vital. You want to get off the mark with a quick three points. 'We've got the belief and confidence we can make a good start and make big things happen in this group. It is a long road, but every minute we are together counts towards that end goal. 'The change in the amount of teams that qualify has given us a boost. That, coupled with the players we've got, we are really confident we can hit the ground running. 'It is a group filled with tough teams, but we feel we can compete with them all.' Wales manager Chris Coleman will travel with a squad that contains star men Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, and their combined impact is not lost on Allen. Under watch: Wales will hope to qualify for the European Championship under Chris Coleman's management . 'We've got the likes of Gareth and Aaron, who have played consistently at the highest level for their clubs, and they are going to bring that to the table for us as well, which is fantastic,' he said. 'We expect to perform, and we have the quality to win the game. It's as simple as that, really. 'There is strong competition for places, and that always breeds success. 'No-one can rest on their laurels. They know if they take their eye off the ball and don't perform to the level expected, then someone else is going to take their place. 'In training, you can see the standards have improved, and that can only hold us in good stead, really.'","Wales train at Cardiff City Stadium ahead of Euro 2016 qualifier at Andorra .

"Argentina defender Federico Fernandez says he can identify with Swansea's style after agreeing a four-year deal to join the Barclays Premier League club. Fernandez also revealed he had received a number of recommendations about the Welsh club, including one by Spanish striker Michu, who is currently on loan at Napoli from Swansea. The Swans stated on their website that Fernandez has signed for an undisclosed fee, subject to international clearance, although it is believed to be £8million. New beginning: Fernandez is delighted to join a side like Swansea which suits his style of play . The 25-year-old passed a medical earlier this week, and is expected to be in Swansea's squad for their league game against Burnley at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday, when manager Garry Monk will look to build on last weekend's 2-1 win at Manchester United. Fernandez's arrival at Swansea from Napoli will bolster Monk's centre-back options, which currently include captain Ashley Williams, Jordi Amat and Kyle Bartley. 'It has always been my dream to play in the Premier League - it is the best in the world - and I'm grateful to Swansea for giving me this opportunity,' Fernandez told the club's official website. 'I asked Michu and Jordi Amat about the club. I obviously trained with Michu at Napoli, and while I was on loan at Getafe (in 2013) I played with (former Swansea loan player) Alvaro Vazquez. He is very good friends with Jordi, so I've spoken to them too. 'Michu told me it is a family club and the city is very relaxed. He said I was joining a very good club. All I've heard are good things about Swansea.' Experience: The 25-year-old has represented Argentina on 26 occasions . Fernandez has won 26 caps for Argentina, including making four appearances at the World Cup in Brazil earlier this summer. He made his international debut against Ecuador three years ago, while his first World Cup finals appearance came during the 2-1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina in Rio de Janeiro. He joined Napoli in 2011 from Estudiantes for around £2.5million, helping them land the Coppa Italia last season during a campaign when they also finished third in Serie A. Fernandez additionally featured in Napoli's Champions League and Europa League campaigns, although he was not involved in either leg of the Europa League last-32 tie against Swansea. 'I can identify myself with the Swansea style. I like to play the ball from the back and, of course, I love to defend too,' Fernandez added. 'I was impressed last weekend with the team's performance and result against Manchester United. 'It was a very intelligent performance. The team really took its opportunities, and it was a fantastic start to the season. I just can't wait to start training and playing games.'

"Wales assistant coach Rob Howley has admitted he was 'flabbergasted' to read comments made by controversial Toulon president Mourad Boudjellal about Leigh Halfpenny. Boudjellal claimed in a French newspaper on Tuesday that terminating Wales and British and Irish Lions full-back Halfpenny's existing two-year contract cannot be discounted due to ongoing injury problems. Halfpenny moved to Toulon from Cardiff Blues in the summer on a deal reputedly worth more than £1million. It was formally announced in January. Wales assistant coach Rob Howley has hit out at comments by Toulon president Mourad Boudjellal about Leigh Halfpenny's injury woes that have kept the full-back from appearing for his new club . He suffered a dislocated shoulder during Wales' RBS 6 Nations defeat against England at Twickenham in March and underwent surgery ahead of an anticipated four month lay-off. But the 25-year-old, who was Lions player of the series against Australia last year, is now struggling with a groin injury. He has yet to play for Toulon, and Boudjellal is rapidly losing patience. Halfpenny's agent Tim Lopez, meanwhile, is understood to have travelled to Toulon following Boudjellal's reported remarks. Halfpenny says his injuries have been frustrating . And Howley revealed that he had spoken with Halfpenny on Monday - 24 hours before Boudjellal cast a cloud over the player's Toulon future. 'I spoke to Leigh, and he was frustrated in not being able to participate in the game,' Howley said, speaking at the launch of a new Welsh Rugby Union concussion campaign. 'When you go to a new club, first and foremost you want to play. But he said he is looking to be running in straight lines and has two weeks to go before he returns. 'That was on Monday, and then on Tuesday I was flabbergasted to see what I read. 'I could not understand, in a team environment, when you're trying to create a culture with trust and honesty, to hear comments like that from a club president. 'When you sign players you should know what they're about, and Leigh is meticulous and his attention to detail is immense. 'It's not nice to hear when a president comes out and questions whether you did an injury before arriving at a club, which was not the case. 'The injury which Leigh had initially was a shoulder problem sustained against England last March in the Six Nations. The recent groin problem has occurred as he tries to rehab and play again. 'I know Toulon have been going through a tough time in the last three or four weeks. 'When you are a president and you've invested a lot into a club and you're going through a difficult time in terms of results. you are going to be frustrated. But I am sure Leigh will be disappointed by the comments.' Wales assistant and attacking coach for the last Lions tour, Howley spoke out in defence of Halfpenny . Boudjellal says he can't rule out terminating Halfpenny's two-year contract with Toulon . Blues chief executive Richard Holland has already confirmed the region's interest in Halfpenny should he become available. Were Halfpenny to depart Toulon, it would raise the possibility of him returning to Wales on a dual contract partly-funded by the Welsh Rugby Union, although he is also likely to attract a worldwide scramble for his services. A £3.3million pot has been set aside to pay players on dual contracts - 60 per cent WRU-funded, and 40 per cent by the four professional regions. It is understood that the initial raft of players could run into double figures and is set to include established names like Sam Warburton, Alun-Wyn Jones, Gethin Jenkins and Taulupe Faletau.","Leigh Halfpenny is yet to appear for Toulon since his big money move .

"Cardiff Blues have announced the signing of Gareth Anscombe from Waikato Chiefs in New Zealand. The move will inevitably increase the possibility of the 23-year-old, who can play fly-half or full-back, breaking into Warren Gatland's Wales squad ahead of next year's World Cup. Gatland is an admirer of Anscombe, who qualifies to wear the red shirt through his Welsh mother. Decorated: Anscombe (left) celebrates Super Rugby glory with the Chiefs in August 2013 . Anscombe will complete his move from Super Rugby to the Blues once he has completed ITM Cup commitments with Auckland. The Blues confirmed that Anscombe has agreed 'a long-term deal' and he will join a squad currently preparing for the new season under rugby director Mark Hammett's guidance. 'My decision to leave New Zealand has been a tough one,' Anscombe said. 'I have loved every minute of my career in New Zealand and I would like to say a special thanks to the Chiefs and Auckland Rugby for everything they have done for me. 'However, in consultation with my family, I came to the conclusion that the opportunity in Wales was one that I simply couldn't turn down. 'I am really excited to be joining a region like Cardiff Blues. Coup: The 23-year-old utility back is a former New Zealand youth international . 'I was lucky enough to be able to visit last year, so I have a degree of familiarity with the club and people that will hopefully help me hit the ground running and start contributing to what I hope will be a successful season for the Blues. 'Much has been made about my Welsh eligibility, and there is no doubt that my mother's side of the family have always reinforced my Welshness. 'However, I am under no illusions and my focus is very much on the Blues, and if the opportunity to represent Wales comes as a result of my performances on the pitch then of course I will take it.' Anscombe has scored more than 250 points during his Super Rugby career, while he helped New Zealand win the Under 20 World Championship three years ago. Blues chief executive Richard Holland described Anscombe's signing as a huge statement of intent by the region. Statement of intent: Cardiff hope that the signing of Anscombe will make up for the loss of Leigh Halfpenny . 'We are absolutely delighted that Gareth has decided to join the Cardiff Blues family. I'm sure supporters right across Welsh rugby will be extremely excited about his arrival,' Holland said. 'Gareth is a fantastically-talented player, a true winner after securing successive (Super Rugby) titles with the Chiefs, and also a very driven and ambitious young man. 'I first met him in October last year and was immediately impressed by his attitude. He has since been to Cardiff to have a close look at the region and is now very keen to move here and get started. 'When Mark Hammett was appointed as our new director of rugby we spoke about potential signings and Gareth was always top of that list. He was extremely keen to bring him over, and now we have concluded that deal after months of negotiations. 'Gareth's signing is an absolutely crucial one for Cardiff Blues, especially following the departure of Leigh Halfpenny (to Toulon), and it shows our absolute intention to strengthen and bring world-class players to our region.'","Gareth Anscombe signs for Cardiff Blues from Super Rugby holders Chiefs .

"Wales prop Adam Jones has written an open letter to Ospreys supporters after signing for Cardiff Blues. The 33-year-old said he 'couldn't wait forever' for his playing future to be resolved, in a letter published by the South Wales Evening Post. British and Irish Lions Test tighthead Jones has been out of work since his Ospreys contract expired at the end of last season. VIDEO Scroll down for The Lions: training down under . New surroundings: Wales prop Adam Jones says he 'couldn't wait forever' in an open letter to Ospreys fans following his move to rivals Cardiff Blues after his contract expired two months ago . He has been training with his former club Neath, as any prospective new deal with the Ospreys hinged on a solution being found to the long-running and ongoing dispute over a fresh agreement between the Welsh Rugby Union and Wales' four professional regions - Ospreys, Blues, Scarlets and Newport Gwent Dragons. 'As pretty much the whole world and his wife will know by now, I had been waiting for a deal to be struck between the regions and the Welsh Rugby Union over a new participation agreement so the Ospreys could conclude a fresh contract with me,' he said. 'I haven't been getting any money, but I was just hoping that the row that has blighted Welsh rugby for so long could be finally settled and I could pull on the black shirt again. 'Then on Sunday morning I received a call from the Blues asking whether I fancied a move there. I had to think long and hard about their proposal because I know all about regional rivalry and how much it matters in Wales. Lions: Jones is nearing the end of his career but hopes to be part of the Wales setup for the World Cup . 'But my circumstances were such that I didn't feel I could turn Cardiff down. I haven't been paid for two months and the season is barely a fortnight away. I need to be properly attached to a team and training with a group of players in readiness for the new campaign. 'I couldn't wait forever. The contract with the Ospreys has been on the table since January, but without signatures it meant only so much. 'No-one is to blame. Andrew Hore (Ospreys chief executive) and Steve Tandy (head coach) have been straight down the line with me throughout the negotiations. They haven't messed me about and I don't think I have messed anyone about, either.' Jones, meanwhile, predicted a bright future for the Ospreys.

'They are going through a rebuilding phase, but with someone like Alun-Wyn (Jones) there - an immense presence in every respect - I still expect them to be pushing for a play-off place in the PRO12,' he added. 'There are also a lot of young players at the region who are going to make Welsh rugby sit up and take notice in the years ahead. 'But a new chapter starts for me now, and I'm just glad I'll be able to focus on rugby again. 'Every player goes through bad times as well as good during his career, and the brilliant thing about Ospreys' supporters is that they have always been there for me when things haven't been going as well as I might have wanted.

"Alex Cuthbert believes Wales will not be engulfed by external pressure when they tackle South Africa in a two-Test series later this month. Wales' record against the Springboks does not augur well for appointments in Durban on June 14 and Nelspruit seven days later. They have beaten South Africa just once in 27 attempts - and that was at the Millennium Stadium 15 years ago - while they will fly out on Thursday minus injured stars such as Sam Warburton, Leigh Halfpenny and Richard Hibbard. Focus: Alex Cuthbert believes Wales will not be engulfed by external pressure when they tackle South Africa . Tricky task: Cuthbert is likely to line up opposite South African wing superstar Bryan Habana . But Cardiff Blues wing Cuthbert is not daunted by the task that awaits Wales in the two Tests and the clash against Eastern Province Kings on June 10. 'There is definitely confidence,' he said. 'Our squad has been together for three to four years, and the confidence we have in each other is really high. 'We just need a bit more consistency and the bit of luck that every Test team needs. 'We are just looking forward to getting down there, and we will hopefully put in a performance over the three games. 'There are not many people (pundits) putting pressure on us, so we will just go out there and play. Everyone expects us to lose, but we are quietly (confident) within the squad. 'We are just going to take each game as it comes. We have a game on the Tuesday against Eastern Province Kings, so we will see what the team will be. Hopefully, we will get the win, and then we will prepare for the Test.' Cuthbert is likely to line up opposite South African wing superstar Bryan Habana, who is fresh from a Heineken Cup and French Top 14 trophy double with Toulon and remains one of world rugby's deadliest finishers. Wants to get started: Cuthbert is relishing the challenge of playing the two Tests over in South Africa . It is a challenge, though, that Cuthbert will relish. 'He has to be one of those (wings) at the top,' Cuthbert added. 'Think of those tries he scored against New Zealand last season. If he hadn't got injured (in that game), South Africa probably would have won. 'Watching him over the years, he's been a world-class player and has sort of changed the way wingers play in terms of how they get involved in the game. 'It's just the amount of touches he has per game. He doesn't just stay on the wing, he comes in off 10, nine, first receiver, and his kick-chase is probably one of the best in the business as well. 'He still has that influence in the Springboks squad - it shows how important he is to them. He is such a threat from anywhere. 'He has all that experience now. Winning the World Cup and all the other trophies that he has won, he's just about as high up there as any winger can be. 'It's definitely a good yardstick to face him. I've played against a lot of other top wingers - (New Zealand's) Julian Savea is probably one of the toughest opponents I have faced - but Habana is going to be right up there.

'We will monitor that closely, but ultimately this period will be very good for him as it will allow him to rest up, recuperate and work on an area of concern with his knee which he hasn't been able to do flat-out for a few seasons now.

"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says work is already under way to keep the players he believes can spark a successful Championship campaign next season. Cardiff end their brief stay in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday with a home clash against Chelsea, after which attention will turn fully to the early stages of masterminding a quickfire top-flight return.

'There are things I would probably have done different, of course. You have to learn from the failures, both as a player and as a coach. That is what I have always tried to do. 'The majority of the players didn’t know the Premier League, the club didn’t know the Premier League, so that unknown was a learning curve. Ousted: Malky Mackay was dismissed by Cardiff in December, despite leading them into the Premier League . Ouster: Vincent Tan's ruling of the Welsh club has been heavily criticised . 'The experience of playing in the Premier League will give everyone a taste of wanting to get back to it. I really hope we will, but it is a lot of hard work ahead, especially mentally. 'My job is to keep as many players as possible, and say this is a club going somewhere and we have got a great chance of bouncing back up. 'I am very determined to start the season really well. That’s the key in the Championship. If you start struggling and you end up in the melee, it’s a tough season. 'We are playing against one of the top teams in Europe, let alone England, on Sunday. The players would like to go out there and challenge themselves. 'We go into the last game wanting to win against Chelsea. No-one wants to end up last in the league.

"Wales star James Hook's move to Aviva Premiership club Gloucester will be confirmed on Tuesday. Gloucester have called a late-afternoon press conference at The Vale Resort - Wales' training base - where he is currently preparing with the national squad for a two-Test South Africa tour. Wales head to Springbok territory on Thursday, by which time 28-year-old Hook will, it is understood, have become Gloucester's latest big-name recruit for next season, joining fellow new arrivals like his Test squad colleague Richard Hibbard, Scotland international half-back Greig Laidlaw and New Zealand prop John Afoa. Statement: James Hook is Gloucester's latest big-name recruit for next season . Fly-half Hook, who has won 75 caps, signed a new long-term deal with French club Perpignan last September, but their subsequent relegation from the Top 14 activated a release clause in his contract. Hook can expect to fill the number 10 shirt at Kingsholm, replacing Leicester-bound England international Freddie Burns. Wales, meanwhile, have delivered a positive fitness bulletin on three players - prop Samson Lee, hooker Ken Owens and centre Jamie Roberts - after they went off injured during last Friday's senior trial match in Swansea. 'We think they will all be training later on in the week, even Samson Lee,' Wales assistant coach and defence specialist Shaun Edwards said on Monday. 'He had a positive scan, and we will re-assess him later in the week. I've spoken to him, and he seems pretty positive in himself. Influence: Hook can expect to fill the number 10 shirt at Kingsholm next season . 'At first, we feared the worst with Samson. We thought he had possibly broken his arm. 'If somebody as tough as Samson Lee comes off with his arm wrapped up like it was, I feared the worst, but it is positive news. He has not broken his arm or his wrist. 'Ken had quite a nasty bang on his knee. We feel he will be training later in the week, and he will be doing more physio. Jamie was precautionary, really, with his shoulder.' Wales' opening Test against South Africa in Durban on June 14 launches a demanding run of games. They meet the Springboks again in Nelspruit seven days later, before South Africa arrive at the Millennium Stadium in November, along with world champions New Zealand and Australia, and then Wales kick off their 2015 RBS 6 Nations campaign at home to England next February. 'We've had a game (trial match), and the boys will feel more confident going into the first Test,' Edwards added. 'It's a mammoth task, probably the toughest place to play rugby in the world, physically. We remember the 2009 Lions Tests there, and also the first Test in 2008, when we (Wales) went over. 'They certainly caught us with their . physicality in that first Test. But in the second Test, I thought we did . exceptionally well and pushed the Springboks very, very close. We can't . be caught on the hop, and that's the reason we had that game (trial . match). On the move: Hook is expected to replace Leicester-bound Freddie Burns . 'It is an outstanding South Africa squad, as usual. Personally, I think it is the best team they've had since the 2007 World Cup.' A potential problem area for Wales head coach Warren Gatland on the tour could be openside flanker, with specialist sevens Sam Warburton and Justin Tipuric both absent through injuries. Regular Test blindside Dan Lydiate is one option, although he has had little game-time in recent weeks with his club Racing Metro, while Scarlets forward Aaron Shingler did the job impressively when he lined up for the Probables in last week's trial. 'He (Lydiate) probably needs a bit of a run-out before then (first Test),' Edwards said. 'Whether he is involved in the first game (Eastern Province Kings on June 10), I am not sure. We will decide that later. 'But to give him confidence, I think it would help him to have a little bit of game-time. Dan Lydiate is an integral part of our team. Maybe we would even take a chance with him without playing in that game. 'We have incurred serious injuries in two top-class performers on the flanks, who obviously can't come on tour. 'Normally, we are very blessed in that area with two outstanding sevens. It is a concern, of course it is, but I thought Aaron Shingler played particularly well on Friday, and there are other people putting their hands up.'","Gloucester have called a press conference at Wales' training base .

"Wolves defender Sam Ricketts has become the fourth player to withdraw from the Wales squad for next Tuesday's opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Andorra. The Football Association of Wales announced on their official website that Ricketts picked up an injury in training on Tuesday. Out: Wolves defender Sam Ricketts has pulled out of the Wales squad after suffering an injury in training . He will be replaced by 35-year-old Danny Gabbidon, who rejoined Cardiff City earlier this week in a player-coach capacity. Defenders Adam Matthews and James Collins had previously pulled out, together with Reading striker Hal Robson-Kanu. They were replaced by Declan John, Paul Dummett and Jake Taylor, respectively. Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen, meanwhile, says Wales are confident they can 'make big things happen' in their qualifying group. Allen and company kick off the campaign away against the Group B minnows Andorra, with the game taking place, as planned, on a new 3G artificial playing surface at Andorra's National Stadium after the pitch was finally given a green light following close inspection by UEFA officials. And Allen knows the importance of making a strong start ahead of home games against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus next month. 'It sounds obvious to say it, but the start is vital. You want to get off the mark with a quick three points,' Allen said. 'We've got the belief and confidence we can make a good start and make big things happen in this group. It is a long road, but every minute we are together counts towards that end goal. 'The change in the amount of teams that qualify has given us a boost. That, coupled with the players we've got, we are really confident we can hit the ground running. 'It is a group filled with tough teams, but we feel we can compete with them all.' Veteran: Ricketts has been playing for Wales for nearly a decade, pictured vs Austria in March 2005 . Call-up: New Cardiff City player/coach Danny Gabbidon has been called up as Rickett's replacement . Wales manager Chris Coleman will travel with a squad that contains star men Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, and their combined impact is not lost on Allen. 'We've got the likes of Gareth and Aaron, who have played consistently at the highest level for their clubs, and they are going to bring that to the table for us as well, which is fantastic,' he added. 'We expect to perform, and we have the quality to win the game. It's as simple as that, really. 'There is strong competition for places, and that always breeds success. 'No-one can rest on their laurels. They know if they take their eye off the ball and don't perform to the level expected, then someone else is going to take their place. Qualifying: Liverpool's Joe Allen is confident Wales can qualify for Euro 2016 . 'In training, you can see the standards have improved, and that can only hold us in good stead, really.' As for the pitch saga, Allen said: 'It doesn't matter what pitch we play on, whatever surface, our focus on is how we play and perform. 'We would prefer to play on grass, that's what we do week in week out and it's an obvious preference. 'But we've all played on artificial surfaces enough times to know what to expect from it, and it's not a problem.'","Ricketts has become the fourth player to pull out of the Wales squad .

"Garry Monk is ready to take his place in the 'madhouse' after being appointed as manager of Barclays Premier League club Swansea. Monk has spoken with several of his new managerial colleagues in English football's top flight after landing a three-year contract at the Liberty Stadium. 'A lot of them said ""welcome to the madhouse"". In fact, pretty much every one of them has said that,' said Monk, who revealed via his Twitter account on Friday night that he had officially retired as a player. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Monk talk about the honour and privilege of managing Swansea . New recruit: Garry Monk is ready to join the Premier League 'madhouse' as permanent Swansea manager . 'I think the bottom line is, out of all the advice I have had, the most important bit is that they have just said be yourself, don't try and be something else. 'For me it has to be that way. You have to learn from what you have done, and that is what I am going to do. 'I have it clear in my mind what I want, and though I am not going to say it's going to be easy to get there, I will try to get there. 'For me, Tony Pulis (Crystal Palace manager) was one of the best I spoke to, to be honest. 'After the game (against Swansea) he came in and spoke. It was a proper manager speaking. He was very honest about his group and my group and the way they work, why they do it. I found it very interesting. 'There have been quite a few managers, and all of them I have spoken to have been good to me. They have been very supportive and encouraging.' Ousted: Monk took charge of the club after Michael Laudrup was sacked in February . Victors: Despite leading them to League Cup victory just 12 months earlier . Adventurers: Napoli's Gonzalo Higuain celebrates their Europa League win over Swansea behind Ben Davies . Monk has been elevated from the head-coaching role he took on in early February after Swansea dispensed with Michael Laudrup's managerial services. During that time, despite a few setbacks in terms of results, he ultimately guided Swansea away from relegation danger and towards mid-table heading into Sunday's season finale at Sunderland. 'It hasn't really sunk in. All I have been thinking about is the games,' he added. 'Everything that happened in the week was great, but we've got a game on Sunday. I went home and I was just planning the training sessions for the next day and what I would say to the players regarding the Sunderland game. I didn't want to make it too much of a distraction to anyone else. 'Because it's not about me right now, it's about finishing the season, and I guess when I get to the summer I will probably reflect upon what has gone on and the magnitude of it.' For his part, Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins has no doubt about Monk's qualities. The Swans have a track record for getting managerial appointments right, as shown by former bosses like Roberto Martinez and Brendan Rodgers, and Jenkins feels that Monk is from a familiar mould. Pedigree: Former Swansea bosses Roberto Martinez and Brendan Rodgers now running Merseyside . 'Like every decision we make, whatever manager you bring in is a gamble. You only have to look to other Premier League clubs to see what has gone on to see that 10 or so managers have changed,"" Jenkins said. 'That argument is completely overshadowed by the fact every club needs, first and foremost, good people you can work with and people you think will take on the challenge, and I think as always at our club look to build their experience and improve things and set their mark. 'The biggest qualities are commitment and a passion for the job and working for Swansea City with the way we want to work. He (Monk) has got the thirst to learn and grow in experience. 'The other side is every young manager in his position will make mistakes, like experienced managers do. You just hope while he's learning we still carry on and achieve success, That is all you can hope for. 'He has got ideas and thoughts of how he would like to implement some of the way we work in the backroom staff like other managers have, and I can see that growing as he gains in confidence as he goes along.'","Gary Monk signed a three-year deal to become Swansea manager .

"Christian Lewis-Pratt says England are primed for success at the Manchester leg of the European Sevens Grand Prix this weekend and believes it will be a crucial tournament in the squad’s preparation for the upcoming HSBC World Sevens Series. Some consistent displays saw Simon Amor’s charges to fourth on the overall Series ladder for 2013/14 – a commendable effort given it was something of a transitional year in terms of coaching staff and playing personnel. Indeed, Lewis-Pratt, who attended Wellington College, believes there is a solid base and a cohesive game-plan on which to build this season. Christian Lewis-Pratt of England on his way to scoring a try against Scotland at the Commonwealth Games . Set for Pool A fixtures against Romania, Belgium and Russia on Saturday at the AJ Bell Stadium, England are eager to string three eye-catching performances together. 'This competition serves two purposes, really,' playmaker Lewis-Pratt explained. 'It’s a chance to win silverware, which is why we all play rugby, and it’s also an opportunity to stake a claim individually. 'We might be trying new people or trying new things before the start of the HSBC Sevens World Series in October. It’s a really important tournament for us. 'Last year was a huge year for us as an entire programme. There was a new coaching staff, new players coming – there was a lot of change and I think you could see that in the way we were playing. 'There were some new philosophies and while it might have taken some time to put everything right we finished the season in a very good place.' England's Christian Lewis-Pratt (L) passes the ball during the  pool match against Sri Lanka at Ibrox Stadium . A rather disappointing Commonwealth Games campaign in Glasgow brought an underwhelming fifth-place finish following defeats to Australia and Samoa. That said, there were exciting victories over Wales and Scotland – two teams who will be represented in Manchester. Given Amor has selected the likes of James Rodwell, Dan Norton and Marcus Watson; there can be little doubt that England are gunning for success before the Series concludes in Bucharest later this month. 'Sadly, we missed out in the Commonwealths,' Lewis-Pratt added. 'We’re a bit bitter about that because we didn’t do ourselves justice. 'In terms of structure and management, we are in good shape and should hit the ground running. 'We’d love to get a win in Manchester to send us on the way to Bucharest.'

"Toulon star Bryan Habana has described it as 'sad' that his Heineken Cup-winning colleague Steffon Armitage is unable to flourish on the international stage. Armitage won the last of his five England caps in 2010 when he played for London Irish. He joined Toulon a year later and has subsequently not been involved with England as the Rugby Football Union holds a strict policy of not selecting overseas-based players unless there are 'exceptional circumstances'. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lancaster say he agrees with the overseas rule . Champion: Armitage (left) helped Toulon lift the Heineken Cup by beating Saracens on Saturday . England head coach Stuart Lancaster recently met with Armitage, and he continues to produce world-class performances, underlined by a brilliant display as Toulon retained their European title in the last Heineken Cup final through a 23-6 victory over Saracens. It appears unlikely, though, that the 28-year-old flanker will be involved in next month's demanding three-Test series against world champions New Zealand. 'Steff has really been phenomenal, and it is sad that because of where he plays he is not going to go on and achieve high honours,' Toulon and South Africa wing Habana said. 'He gets vital turnovers that get the scoreboard ticking - three, six, nine points - and our team thrives on that. He is a crucial part of the team. 'He has put his hand up this whole season. People write him off at their own peril. He has been absolutely wonderful - he can dominate games. Impressive: Lancaster was in the crowd as Armitage starred for Toulon on Saturday at Millennium Stadium . 'As a player, you understand the commitments the countries need to grow their own game and you understand their logic. You respect the decisions made by the administrators. 'The decision is out of our hands, but I think a guy like Steffon, with the season he has had, probably deserves to be playing international rugby. He is a great team man.' While Armitage made the final's dominant individual contribution along with centre Matt Giteau, it was Toulon skipper Jonny Wilkinson who inevitably took centre-stage in his last appearance on British soil before retirement. England World Cup winner Wilkinson will bow out of the game after next weekend's French Top 14 final against Castres in Paris, and he kicked 13 points as Toulon became only the third team after Leicester and Leinster to successfully defend European rugby's major club crown. 'Jonny is a once-in-a-career, once-in-a-lifetime player,' Habana added. 'You look at sporting greats, and he will probably rank up there with some of the greats in any formula of athletic ability. 'It's never going to be nice saying goodbye to him. He has had an impeccable career, and the humility he has shown, the way he puts work ethic into a whole different category has been outstanding. Outcast: Armitage last played for England in 2010, but hasn't been eligible since his move to France . 'I don't think he will ever be able to be replaced. There is only going to be one Jonny Wilkinson, only one guy who has achieved what he has. 'We are going to miss Jonny, what he brings to the team, what he brings to the whole environment. How he lifts the whole team and whole city is something immense.' Even without Wilkinson next season, it is difficult to envisage Toulon not featuring prominently in the new European Rugby Champions Cup, such is their all-round strength, quality and character. 'Four months ago after we lost to Grenoble (in the Top 14) everyone had sort of written us off, but the character and leadership shown in this team from people like Jonny, Matt Giteau and Juan Lobbe is outstanding,' Habana said. 'People throw it out about players going to Toulon to retire and for the money. People call us mercenaries, but I see the work ethic of the guys, the work that gets put in on the training pitch and in the gym. 'But over and above it, there is the team spirit, the vibe in the playing group and the ability to overcome a disappointing mid-point of the season. 'When you are involved in a team where the guy next to you is willing to go that extra yard, not for himself, but for the jersey and his team-mate, it makes it really special. 'It has been a massive honour for me to go to Toulon. Winning the Heineken Cup final was the first step, and there is another big one for us next week.'","England head coach Stuart Lancaster recently met with Toulon flanker Armitage .

"Steffon Armitage sent another reminder to the English selectors on Tuesday night when he was named Top 14 Player of the Year at the French ‘Oscars du rugby’. The Toulon flanker, one of Europe’s standout players, has not played for England since 2010 because of the RFU’s policy of not selecting overseas-based players. But Armitage, 28, has been one of the most consistent performers in the star-studded French league and said on Twitter: ‘Thank you everyone that came tonight #OscarMidiOlympique I am honoured to get it ..even tho the whole #rctteam deserved it!!thanks again’ Honoured: Steffon Armitage tweeted his delight at picking up the prestigious Player of the Year award . Standout: Flanker Steffon Armitage has become one of Europe's top players out in France with Toulon . The dynamic back-row is reported to be considering a move that would allow him to play for France, exploiting a loophole that lets players switch allegiances before the 2015 World Cup. However, IRB chief executive Brett Gosper said on Tuesday that he is hoping to tighten the rules, which were intended to help smaller countries compete in the sevens competition at the 2016 Olympics. ‘There is a regulations committee that will look at all applications for transfer and they will look to see if it’s for bona fide Sevens reasons,’ said Gosper. ‘There is a safety net and any transfer will have to be passed by the committee. They will act according to the spirit of the law. Banished: Armitage hasn't played for England since 2010 due to an RFU policy on overseas-based players . ‘For example, if we have huge props applying for a career in sevens, then we’ll smell a rat. That’s an obvious example and there will be some cases that are in a grey area, but we want to ensure the integrity of the regulation and the spirit behind it is upheld. ‘Any obvious abuses that go counter to that spirit of why we’re doing this will be caught in the regulations committee net. But players will move in both codes by coming into the sevens game – that will happen.’","Toulon flanker picks up prestigious award at French 'Oscars du rugby'

"Phil Vickery hopes the British and Irish Lions 'transcend politics' and resist a name change if Scotland votes for independence next week. The Lions could be forced to drop the term 'British' from their famous moniker should Scotland leave the United Kingdom, officials from the long-running touring outfit have confirmed. John Spencer, England's representative on the Lions board, told the Daily Telegraph the matter would be discussed at the next board meeting following a 'Yes' vote in Scotland. Phil Vickery, pictured after breaking the world record for the number of people in a rugby scrum at Twickenham on Friday, hopes the British and Irish Lions will resist a name change . Five-cap Lions prop Vickery admitted it would be 'very sad' if the collective from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland were forced into a rebranding. 'Sport needs to transcend politics, the British and Irish Lions can transcend politics, and I hope that's what happens,' said Vickery. 'Any time sport is used as a vehicle it is very, very sad.' Spencer, already installed as Lions tour manager for the 2017 New Zealand challenge, confirmed the issue would be discussed at the next board meeting should Scotland gain independence. 'It has not yet been mentioned, but if Scotland voted to become independent then the board would have to discuss it at our next meeting,' Spencer told The Telegraph. 'We would have to do so out of courtesy to the countries involved. That last thing we want to do is to cause offence to anyone.' John Spencer (left), England's representative on the Lions board, said the matter of a possible name change would be discussed at the next board meeting . Former England and Lions front-rower Vickery said it is vital the Lions do not alter their selection criteria in drawing players from across the British Isles, whatever the politics. 'It would be very sad if that happened that the name had to change,' said Vickery. 'I think they can continue with the name. 'We've got to be careful because sport and politics don't mix that well. Phil Vickery made five appearance for the Lions . 'The Lions will always be what it is, I like the British and Irish Lions and feel proud saying that name. 'If it becomes just the Lions, I would be sad. 'But the important thing is Lions squads must always include Scotland.' When the Lions first officially toured in 1891, they were known as the British Isles, but have subsequently headed overseas as the British Lions and then British and Irish Lions, which became their title for the Australia 2001 trip and has subsequently remained. The Lions' history is littered with great names of Scottish rugby. They have had four post-war Scottish Lions tour captains - Arthur Smith, Mike Campbell-Lamerton, Finlay Calder and Gavin Hastings - while former Scotland full-back Andy Irvine holds the record for most Lions points. Irvine, the 2013 Lions tour manager in Australia, amassed 274 points in 42 appearances compiled across successive trips in 1974, 1977 and 1980. When the Lions ventured Down Under last year, though, Scotland only provided three original squad selections in full-back Stuart Hogg, wing Sean Maitland and lock Richie Gray, before prop Ryan Grant was summoned as a replacement for an injured Gethin Jenkins.","Phil Vickery hopes British and Irish Lions will resist name change if Scotland votes for independence .

"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer believes it would 'definitely be a bigger miracle' than Manchester United's epic 1999 Champions League final triumph if Cardiff can avoid Barclays Premier League relegation. Solskjaer and Teddy Sheringham scored injury-time goals as United beat Bayern Munich 2-1 in Barcelona on one of British football's most famous nights. The current Cardiff manager now faces the task of trying to keep his team afloat. VIDEO Scroll down for Solskjaer: It's still possible to get out of the bottom 3 . Miracle: Solkskjaer says his side need to produce wonders if they are to avoid the drop . Currently bottom of the league, they require victories in their final two games - at Newcastle on Saturday and against Cardiff City Stadium visitors Chelsea in nine days' time - to retain any survival hope. Even then, they still need other results to work in their favour, but Solskjaer has no intention of throwing in the towel. 'If we stay up it would definitely be a bigger miracle than Barcelona in 1999,' he said. 'That night it was possible, and in football anything is possible. So we need to give ourselves a chance in front of our fans against Chelsea. 'It takes belief, togetherness, a team that goes the extra mile, and a hero stepping forward and doing something magical. Up against it: Cardiff are bottom of the Premier League with two games remaining . Miracle: Solksjaer famously scored the winner for United in 1999 as they came from behind in the final minutes . 'It's still possible, it's still possible that we are out of the bottom three if we win this weekend. We have got to give ourselves something to play for in the last game by winning this game. 'One of the key points is just imagine how this place (Cardiff City Stadium) will be next weekend if we have got something to play for, when we have got something to play for. 'Let's give ourselves a chance by beating Newcastle, because this place will be absolutely rocking if we are in with a chance.' Cardiff's woefully erratic form this season suggests a quickfire Championship return is the likely outcome of a chaotic campaign on and off the pitch. And if the Bluebirds do go down, it would be an experience Solskjaer has only felt once before in football. 'It was with my local team (in Norway),' he added. 'I think I scored two thirds of our goals that season. It's the only relegation I have had. 'But you can't compare that. I was just playing for my local team. I was 21. I never thought I would play football for anything else but enjoyment. 'Here, you can see how much it means for your players, your fans, for so many more than just yourself and your little town if you play in the second or third division back home. 'Here, you have got a much bigger responsibility, and that's my job now. This is a fantastic club. We are going into this game to give ourselves a chance to stay up.' Cardiff will face a Newcastle side reeling from six successive league defeats, a sequence that has piled pressure on manager Alan Pardew and caused huge unrest among Magpies supporters. Pressure: Alan Pardew faces protests from fans this weekend but Solskjaer defended the Newcastle boss . Threats: Solskjaer sees the likes of Sissoko (right) and Remy (left) as dangers to Cardiff's survival chances . 'When clubs lose games there is always going to be noise, but Alan is doing his job and he deserves to do so, and I am doing my job to the best of my ability,' Solskjaer said. 'We know we can only control ourselves. I will let Alan deal with his problems, and I will control my issues. I am not one of those who talks too much about the opposition. 'We need something special. We have to go there and defend well against the likes of (Moussa) Sissoko, (Loic) Remy and (Shola) Ameobi, but we've got to do to them what they do to us. 'It is a difficult position we are in, but it is still possible if we go and win at Newcastle. Short term, it is going to be a big tall mountain to climb. We need to win both games, and we need to have some help.'

Spanish defender Cala had earlier been sent off by referee Phil Dowd for a professional foul on Sunderland striker Connor Wickham. He will miss the Newcastle game.

"Leicester captain Ed Slater is unlikely to play any part in England's autumn Test series after undergoing knee surgery. The 26-year-old lock has been sidelined since captaining England's midweek side to a 38-7 victory over Super 15 outfit the Crusaders in New Zealand in June. Leicester have ruled Slater out for 'several months', with England launching their autumn schedule by hosting New Zealand at Twickenham on November 8. Blow: England lock Ed Slater will be sidelined for several months after undergoing knee surgery . Confirmed: Leicester boss Richard Cockerill made Slater his captain at the start of the season . Slater would have been primed to battle Joe Lanchbury, Courtney Lawes and Dave Attwood for a second-row berth in head coach Stuart Lancaster's full England side.

'It is disappointing for Tom and the club,' London Irish director of rugby Brian Smith said. 'He has had a great pre-season and was champing at the bit to be back playing.' The exiles endured a difficult afternoon at Twickenham. They were 20-6 down at half time having not even made it into the Quins 22 and, despite improving in the second half, Brian Smith's side failed to make up the defecit.

"England and Leicester received mixed news on Tuesday as Tom Croft insisted it is ‘business as usual’ following a shoulder scare — only for club captain Ed Slater to be ruled out for the season. Croft pulled out of Saturday’s Aviva Premiership opener against Newcastle after experiencing pain as a result of a stinger he suffered in pre-season. Given Croft’s injury history — he sustained a career threatening neck injury two seasons ago and last year needed extensive surgery on torn knee ligaments — there were fears the England and Lions flanker could be facing another extended spell on the side-lines. But, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail, the 28-year-old revealed he is fit and ready to face Exeter at Sandy Park on Saturday. Business as usual: Lions flanker Tom Croft told Sportsmail he is ready to make his comeback . Blow: England lock Ed Slater will be sidelined for several months after undergoing knee surgery . ‘It’s business as usual as far as I’m concerned,’ he said. ‘I felt a bit of a twinge in the shoulder in training last week and we decided the safer option was to miss one game rather than risk a longer period of time off. The idea is to play against Exeter. ‘It’s the first full pre-season I’ve had for a long time and I’m feeling really good. I’ve put on some weight and am weighing in around 109kg (17st 2lb) but the speed tests say I’ve maintained my speed. ‘I’ve got a new knee and a new neck and I’m feeling stronger and fitter than I have done in years. My hunger for success is as strong as ever.’ The news was not so good for Croft’s team-mate Slater. The highly regarded lock, a member of England’s elite player squad and an outside bet for next year’s World Cup, had knee surgery last week to repair damage sustained playing for England against Canterbury Crusaders in New Zealand in June. ‘It’s horrific for Ed in many ways,’ said Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill. ‘It’s a critical year for us and for him with the World Cup coming up and the likelihood is that he is not going to play a game between now and pre-season next year.’ Slater played on for 20 minutes after suffering the injury, which was only spotted when he returned to Leicester following the tour. Confirmed: Leicester boss Richard Cockerill made Slater his captain at the start of the season . ‘He has had his ACL reconstructed and he will be pretty much out for the season,’ Cockerill added. ‘Those things don’t show up well on scans and it looked relatively OK, so the first option was to rehab it and see how it settled. But it wasn’t settling so we had another look and it (ACL) was hanging on by a thread so the surgeon put him back together.’ Slater was not the only England hopeful to be dealt an injury setback as London Irish revealed their 24-year-old goal-kicking full back Tom Homer, who missed the bulk of last season with a groin problem, suffered significant knee ligament damage in Saturday’s loss to Harlequins. Meanwhile Premier Rugby have ruled out any possibility of a change to the structure of the league following calls from Saracens chief executive Ed Griffiths to scrap the play-offs and introduce a fixture list more akin to Premier League football, with the side finishing top of the table at the end of the regular season being crowned champions. Saracens lost last season’s play-off final in the dying minutes of extra time to Northampton after topping the league by nine points. ‘There are no plans to change the structure of the competition,’ said a Premier Rugby spokesman. Bath wing Anthony Watson has signed a new deal that will keep at the Recreation Ground until 2017.

"England will descend on ‘Mile-High City’ in July for a two-week, high-altitude training camp designed to leave them in peak physical condition ahead of the home World Cup. Stuart Lancaster has arranged to take an expanded national squad of about 50 players — plus coaches and support staff — to Denver, Colorado, as a means of enhancing their physical condition and escaping the pressurised tournament build-up at home. The city’s nickname is based on its location, which is a mile above sea level at 5,280ft, amid the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. While in the city, England’s training base will be Infinity Park, in the suburb of Glendale; home of the Glendale Raptors and a venue known as ‘Rugbytown USA’. Mile up: England coach Stuart Lancaster is ensuring his World Cup squad will be in peak physical condition . Lancaster knows the facilities from his time as head coach of the Saxons, when he and Andy Farrell coached England’s second-string side at the 2009 Churchill Cup in Denver. A handful of players involved in that event may be back there next summer, including Dan Cole, Rob Webber, Danny Cipriani and Stephen Myler. It is understood talks began months ago about the notion of temporarily moving England en masse to an alternative location, partly to guard against staleness during the prolonged World Cup countdown. Various options were discussed before Lancaster decided a return to familiar territory in the States made most sense. Since then, England’s strength and conditioning staff have travelled to Colorado and fully endorse the choice. Passionate: Lancaster and his team will be determined for England to perform at the home World Cup . The benefits of training at altitude — where the air is thinner so the body has to work harder for oxygen — are well-established in a wide variety of sports. England expect to boost the fitness of their players in terms of accelerating the necessary fat-burning process, but accept that there will not be a respiratory ‘legacy’ by the time the World Cup starts in mid-September. After having four weeks off at the end of this season, the squad will reconvene for a fortnight at Pennyhill Park then fly across the Atlantic for two weeks in Denver. At the end of their stay, there is a possibility that Lancaster’s men will take part in a training game against the USA — whose union are based in nearby Boulder, Colorado. However, firm plans are still some way off. Sprawling: The Infinity Park in Denver, Colorado, will host England's rugby squad next summer . Upon returning home, England will take a week’s break before re-gathering in Surrey ahead of warm-up matches against France, home and away, and Ireland. By then, they will hope to be feeling the benefits of their Stateside excursion. For Lancaster and his coaches, fitness is a hot topic after the June tour of New Zealand, which concluded with a heavy defeat by the All Blacks in Hamilton that created concerns about the condition of their side. Three of England’s World Cup-winning women’s team — Margaret Alphonsi, Katherine Merchant and Joanna McGilchrist — have retired from international rugby following their triumph in Paris last month.","Expanded squad of 50 players to descend on 'Mile-High City' in July .

"Australia wrapped up a series whitewash over France with a comprehensive 39-13 victory in the third and final Test at the Allianz Stadium in Sydney. Israel Folau scored two of Australia's five tries in the triumph, with debutant Will Skelton, Michael Hooper and Nick Phipps also crossing. Fly-half Bernard Foley added the rest of the points with four conversions and two penalties giving him a personal haul of 14 points as the Wallabies made it seven Tests in a row for the first time since 1999-2000. Try: Israel Folau scores a try while Brice Dulin (right) attempts to stop him from doing so . Stop: Australia's Wycliff Palu rides through a tackle from France's Mogan Parra in Sydney . Prolific: Folau scored two of Australia's five tries in the 39-13 triumph over France . Done: Australia celebrate winning the Series in a whitewash on France . Sorry France could only respond with a solitary converted try from Guilhem Guirado in the second half plus a couple of penalties as they were convincing beaten - their 13th loss in 19 Tests and one that will increase the pressure on coach Philippe Saint-Andre. That match was as good as over by half-time as Australia stormed into a 20-6 lead as they banished the memories of last weekend's scrappy 6-0 win in the second Test with an impressive showing. Foley's third-minute penalty set the hosts on their way and they were 10-0 ahead inside eight minutes thanks to newcomer Skelton. The giant 22-year-old, who was drafted into starting line-up in place of former Wallabies captain James Horwill, showed his considerable power as he barged his way past the challenge of France flanker Fulgence Ouedraogo to crash over from 12 yards out. France full-back Brice Dulin got his side off the mark with a penalty but Foley responded with another three-pointer of his own and then Australia took advantage of the yellow card shown to Rabah Slimani to further increase their lead. Defeat: Sorry France could do little to respond to Australia's dominance, scoring a solitary try . Done: The match was a good as over by half-time as Australia stormed into a 20-6 lead . A regular sight: Folau celebrates scoring his try during the third Test between Australia and France . Prop Slimani was sin-binned in the 27th minute for tackling without the ball and within a minute of his departure Australia claimed their second try, Folau stretching over in the corner after play had been quickly spread out to the right. Foley added his second successful conversion to make it 20-3 and, although Maxime Machenaud hit back for France with a penalty just before half-time, the Wallabies were in total control at the break. And that dominance continued in the second half with Ewen McKenzie's men further increasing their lead inside two minutes as Folau crossed for the second time in the match - and the 13th time in Tests - when he capitalised on good work from Skelton to storm through the heart of the France defence and touch down. Keep it up: Australia's dominance stretched further into the second half as France fell at their feet . Leader: Australia captain Michael Hooper holds up the Trophee des Bicentenaires after beating France . Flanker Hooper added a fourth Australia try on the hour mark after more quick handling and incisive running saw the Wallabies cut through the middle, with Foley adding the extras to make it 34-6. France finally had something to smile about in the 65th minute when they pulled a try back through Guirado, who was powered over by a driving maul, but Australia had the last word when replacement Phipps notched his maiden Test try late on after catching Les Bleus cold with a quickly-taken tap penalty.

"Manu Tuilagi will be restored to his natural habitat on Saturday as England seek a solution to their perennial midfield conundrum by reverting to the partnership which excelled in Auckland. A week after the experimental deployment of the Leicester centre out wide, he will be back in the No 13 shirt for the series finale in Hamilton, alongside Kyle Eastmond. The decision by Stuart Lancaster and his assistants to reunite that Eden Park axis means an abrupt demotion for Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell – the former right out of the match-day 23 and the latter to the replacements bench. Central Line: Manu Tuilagi will return to his favoured position when England meet New Zealand in Hamilton . Demoted: Luther Burrell (L) and Billy Twelvetrees have been sacrificed to make changes . VIDEO Rowntree rouses England pack for final push . The upheaval doesn’t end there, in the aftermath of the 28-27 second Test defeat in Dunedin, as there are seven personnel changes to the starting XV, despite Lancaster’s intention to minimise disruption and foster continuity. The anticipated half-back revamp is in response to injuries, with Ben Youngs and Freddie Burns replacing Danny Care and Owen Farrell, who have shoulder and knee problems respectively. Chris Ashton has been recalled to fill the wing space vacated by Tuilagi. Up front, the coaches have opted to add ballast from among the Aviva Premiership Final contingent who arrived late on tour – with Dylan Hartley returning at hooker, Courtney Lawes in the second row and Billy Vunipola at No 8. The powerful trio are expected to provide physicality and the intensity of men who have impatiently awaited this belated opportunity. Amid talking points aplenty, the midfield equation is once again prominent. It is the area which has caused England endless problems and prompted regular debates for a decade and more, since the World Cup-winning days of Will Greenwood, Mike Catt and Mike Tindall. Like his predecessors, Lancaster has been forced to constantly reshuffle his centre candidates, partly due to injury and partly due to the never-ending quest to find the most potent blend. Diving in: Chris Ashton will take over Manu Tuilagi's place on the wing against New Zealand . The head coach denied yesterday that this latest 12-13 selection represented excessive rotation, while confirming that it was a form call. ‘I don’t think it’ s muddied the waters,’ said Lancaster. ‘We actually played the same backline throughout the whole Six Nations, give or take. The Farrell-Burrell-Twelvetrees partnership played right the way through. ‘I still think we are finding out which players can really deliver at the highest level. We’ve had a good chance to look at Billy Twelvetrees during the course of the season. Kyle Eastmond’s come in, he’s had one opportunity, he’s taken it, so now’s the right time to give him a second chance. ‘Billy wasn’t that far off it at the weekend, but when I look at the two games, I thought Kyle edged him. When you are weighing that up, and you want to have a look at Kyle at some point, the reality is that we need four centres who can play throughout the World Cup, so we need to find out now.’ It is ironic that the 10-12 combination of Burns and Eastmond was viewed as a potential weak link going into the series opener and now those same players will be tasked with inspiring a consolation victory. In a spin: England coach Stuart Lanacster denies that his seven personnel changes are excessive . VIDEO Watson says Crusaders win will help Test team . Lancaster has repeatedly emphasised that he prefers a genuine second-receiver playmaker at inside centre and he believes Eastmond can fulfil that brief, as Twelvetrees has done in the past. ‘I think they are very similar in terms of what they offer,’ he said. ‘We want Kyle to support Freddie the way he did in the first Test, offer that ball-playing ability and keep width in our game. He has a good, improved kicking game and he’s on form.’ Lancaster denied that the recall and swift removal of both Twelvetrees and Burrell from the starting midfield suggested that the coaches were indulging in impulsive tinkering. He insisted that it was a valid leap of faith in players who had distinguished themselves during the Six Nations. ‘Billy picked up his injury on May 3 and really only trained in the week prior to the second Test,’ he said. ‘Looking back, it was a big step to put him into that second Test. I don’t regret it because I don’t think it was the key differential between winning and losing, but it was a big step and how are you supposed to know unless you try it? For Luther, too, it was a big step to play at that level.’ Ballast: Billy Vunipola will provide physicality and intensity as part of England's front three . The one-match experiment of using Tuilagi on the wing was not the resounding success the coaches would have hoped for, but Lancaster was adamant that he had no regrets on that score either, adding: ‘I think it was fine. Manu played well and didn’t make any errors. He contributed well to the game and it is definitely something we will look at for the future. It is more about us feeling that the centre partnership worked better in the first Test than in the second.’ Ashton’s return to the starting line-up is a positive end to a difficult period for the cross-code wing. His try-scoring cameo as a replacement last weekend was his first appearance for England in 2014, having been dropped prior the Six Nations, but management doubts about Jonny May’s reliability at this level have created an opening for him to re-establish himself. ‘It’s a massive opportunity for him,’ said Lancaster. ‘He understands that. We felt he had areas of his game to work on and all the evidence is that he is ready to take his chance again. We will see whether he has learned and can deliver again.’ ENGLAND: M Brown (Harlequins); C Ashton . (Saracens), M Tuilagi (Leicester), K Eastmond (Bath), M Yarde .

"England's experimental use of Manu Tuilagi on the wing may be short-lived after a match where he was unable to emulate the explosive impact he had from midfield seven days earlier. Stuart Lancaster was asked after this defeat if the ploy would be repeated next week and said: ‘We’ve got to assess the game. ‘We won’t make any decisions until Wednesday next week. Overall, the back-line created opportunities as a group; the disappointment is that we weren’t able to finish them. But three tries in Dunedin is not a bad return.’ Deft: Manu Tuilagi holds off two New Zealand defenders to hand off for Chris Ashton to go over . Forward surge: Manu Tuilagi is stopped by Julian Savea as he powers toward the try line . Late rally: Chris Ashton goes over for England's third try in Dunedin . Proud: Stuart Lancaster (right) praised his players for scoring three tries against New Zealand . Tuilagi did make a telling contribution at the end of the match, when his back-hand off-load sent Mike Brown clear and paved the way for Chris Ashton’s try, but prior to that there had been ample proof that he is not a bona fide winger. The most obvious example came just before half-time when Tuilagi broke clear on the right but lacked the pace to finish off the chance he created. Time and again, the All Blacks sought to target him and, while the 23-year-old’s defensive resolve was not in question, every kick behind him equated to a flurry of panic in English ranks as he set about the unfamiliar routine of turning and tracking back under pressure. Overall, there was just an over-riding sense that one of England’s primary attacking weapons had been somewhat marginalised, which suited New Zealand far more than the tourists. Breakaway: Manu Tuilagi sprints away from the New Zealand defenders but is caught short of the try line . Pros: Manu Tuilagi helped to set up a try, created a scoring opportunity for himself, made six tackles — three more than last week — and showed an increasing hunger to go looking for the ball as the game wore on. Cons: He was less heavily involved — he had 10 runs, three fewer than in the first Test — and lacked conviction when the ball was kicked in his vicinity. He was also unable to take his scoring chance.","New Zealand continually looked to exploit Tuilagi's defensive weaknesses .

"This week the Royal family hope to be celebrating a very important date as they, along with the rest of the nation, wait on tenter hooks for the arrival of the new heir to the throne. There's also another reason to celebrate this Wednesday: if the baby arrives today he/she will be sharing his/her birthday with new grandmother Camilla, as the Duchess of Cornwall celebrates her 66th birthday. Camilla and husband Prince Charles were in Lostwithielfor, Cornwall for the celebrations, where they completed their three-day visit of Devon and Cornwall.

On Monday the Duchess  was presented with an early birthday present - a card made by blind and partially sighted children. Camilla, said she was delighted with . the card, which was created by children at the WESC Foundation in . Exeter, where she is a patron. Her . visit to the centre, which provides specialist learning, care and . therapy to blind and partially sighted four to 25-year-olds, came on her . second day of engagements in Devon and Cornwall. Camilla's visit to WESC marked the opening of Cornwall House, an accommodation unit for five young people at the centre. Marie Larcombe, 20, presented the Duchess with a posy of flowers as children sang in a choir and played drums during a reception in a marquee. Louie Britton, 15, then handed Camilla the large card decorated with Braille and moon symbols. The Duchess told the reception of 150 guests: ""Oh, look at those beautiful flowers.

"Ukraine's prime minister Mykola Azarov resigned along with his entire cabinet today over the country's deepening political crisis, as parliament repealed harsh anti-protester laws. Azarov said he was stepping down in a bid to ease 'a political compromise to peacefully resolve the conflict' and preserve Ukraine's unity, adding that he had been forced to work in 'extreme conditions'. In a statement on the presidential website prime minister Viktor Yanukovych said: 'I accept the resignation of Mykola Azarov and as a consequence the resignation of the entire Ukrainian government.' He added that Azarov will remain in a temporary role until a new government can be elected. Scroll down for video . Ukraine's prim minister Mykola Azarov submitted his resignation this morning amid continuing political protests in the capital Kiev . At a special session of parliament today the Ukrainian government has scrapped anti-protest laws which sparked violence across the country . President Viktor Yanukovych has also offered an amnesty to imprisoned demonstrators if activists cease their occupation of central Kiev . While the joint moves are a major concession to anti-government protesters across the country, they do not address the two key demands that Yanukovych himself stands down and that fresh elections are held. Yanukovych has also suggested he will offer an amnesty for arrested . protesters on the condition that demonstrators stopped occupying . buildings and ended their round-the-clock protests on Kiev's central . Independence Square. Azarov was a fierce political leader loyal to the president, who once told his critics to 'piss off'. The Russian national has been the target of opposition ridicule in the past for his inability to speak Ukrainian. He has blasted an EU partnership deal that was scrapped by Yanukovych and has hailed Russia's controversial bailout of Ukraine as 'historic'. Azarov has also taken to Facebook to thank supporters and take on critics, accusing the opposition of trying to stage a 'coup' and reiterating his message of stability - particularly for pensioners. He headed the election campaign in 2010 that helped Yanukovych defeat his sworn rival - now jailed opposition leader - Yulia Tymoshenko. Azarov's departure will be welcomed by the activists, as he was a particular target of anti-government hatred . Yesterday a man was found dead hanging from Independence Square protest 'tree' in Kiev. The 'new year tree' has become a symbol of pro-EU and anti-government protests . Standing guard: Demonstrators stand guard at the entrance to the Justice Ministry, which became the fourth government building to be occupied during the protests, but was quickly abandoned after the justice minister threatened to declare a state of emergency . Violent: Hundreds of protestors burst into the building on Sunday night. They erected a number of barricades, before burning a portrait of President Viktor Yanukovych . Defence: The ministry is situated several hundred metres away from the main protest camp in central Kiev. Above, a protester erects a barricade near the building . Action: Speaking to a local TV crew, Ms Lukash said the 'so-called protesters' had seized the building as ministry employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to protesters. Above, demonstrators pull a public bin to be used in the construction of barricades . Arseniy Yatsenyuk, one of the protest leaders, has already turned down the now-vacant prime minister's . job, which Yanukovych had offered him on Saturday. A . key issue moving forwards will be the amnesty offer, which could allow for the release . of dozens of protesters currently being held in jail in exchange for an . end to the demonstrations. Azarov's departure has brought encouragement to people at the protest encampment, but no inclination to end their demonstrations. 'The authorities are afraid and making concessions. We should use this moment and continue our fight to achieve a change of power in Ukraine,' said 23-year-old demonstrator Oleg Rudakov. In another sinister development yesterday a . 55-year-old man was found dead hanging from the framework of a . huge artificial 'New Year tree' in central Kiev which has become a . symbol of anti-government resistance. Police . said they removed the body, which was hanging inside the cone-shaped . tubular steel construction on Kiev's Independence Square. The 'tree' is . festooned with a poster of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and . scrawled with graffiti attacking president Viktor Yanukovich. The . body, that of a man from Volyn region in western Ukraine, had no . external wounds and was being examined to establish the cause of death, a police statement said. The . incident was especially bizarre since the square has been swarming with . protesters day and night since the onset of mass demonstrations against . in early December. Last night protesters briefly occupied the ministry building of Elena Lukash, Ukraine's justice minister, but abandoned it again after she threatened to call off talks and declare a state of emergency. Seized: Staff had also been attempting to make changes in the constitution, she said. Above, three anti-government protesters stand guard at the ministry with icons . Speech: Opposition leader and former WBC heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko (pictured) addresses the media in front of the ministry in Kiev today . Demonstrations: Beleaguered President Viktor Yanukovych offered the prime minister's post to Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Saturday, which he declined . Chaos: President Yanukovych also offered former boxer Vitali Klitschko, another opposition leader, the role of Deputy Prime Minister. Above, protestors face riot police . Upcoming 'judgement day': Mr Yatsenyuk said protests would continue and that a special session of parliament called for Tuesday would be 'judgement day' Though the occupation was short lived, it underlines protesters' growing . inclination to take radical action after two months of largely peaceful . demonstrations turned violent. Three . protesters died in the clashes last week, two of whom were shot by . hunting rifles, which police insist they do not use. With protesters now . willing to risk injury, a state of emergency would be likely to set off . substantial fighting on the streets of the capital. 'Today, such a measure is not on the table,' Foreign Minister Leonid Kozhara told journalists. EU . foreign police chief Catherine Ashton said in a statement that she was . alarmed by reports about the government considering a state of emergency . and warned that such a move 'would trigger a further downward spiral . for Ukraine which would benefit no one.' Ashton, . who is set to travel to Ukraine Tuesday, called for a dialogue and . urged the opposition leaders to dissociate themselves from those who . resort to violence. Protesters still occupy three sizable buildings in downtown Kiev, . including City Hall. One of the buildings was seized in a spectacular . assault early Sunday, when hundreds of protesters threw rocks and . firebombs into the building where about 200 police were sheltering. The . crowd eventually formed a corridor through which the police left. Lukash, . in a televised statement, noted that protesters seized the building as . justice employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to . the activists and to make changes in the constitution to restore more power . to the prime minister. A city in flames: The president's announcement came as fresh violence erupted in Kiev, with a large crowd attacking a government exposition and conference hall . Danger: Demonstrators were throwing firebombs into the Ukrainian House building and setting off fireworks - to which police responded with tear gas . Deal: President Yanukovych has offered the role of Prime Minister to Arseniy Yatsenyuk (left) with fellow opposition leader Vitali Klitschko (right) as his deputy.

"Mike Ashley’s lawyers have insisted the Newcastle owner had been joking when he told a journalist he was ready to sack manager Alan Pardew. The controversial billionaire boss of Sports Direct came out with the comments while leaning on the wall outside a pub in London’s trendy Soho district. According to The Independent, he said Pardew had: ‘One more game — if we lose against Stoke on Monday night then he’s gone. I have had enough. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has been under fire as of late with supporters holding protests for his sack . Newcastle owner Mike Ashley denied he was being serious in saying manager Alan Pardew could lose his job . Mike Ashley: 'If we lose against Stoke on Monday night then he's gone. I have had enough. Dead. Finished. Over' ‘Dead. Finished. Over. One more game then that’s it. What would you do? I have spent a lot of money on that club, it’s cost me a lot. I won’t put up with it any more. Honestly, answer me, what would you do? One more loss and he’s gone, he’s over, finished.’ On Saturday night, Ashley’s lawyers maintained: ‘Mr Ashley responded, tongue in cheek, that Mr Pardew had two more games before being sacked. ‘To put this into perspective, over the past few weeks certain reports have stated that they believe that Mr Pardew has two more games before being sacked. Mr Ashley was therefore humouring the reporter.’ Whatever the reason for his words, it is one more embarrassing affair for the eccentric chairman who bought Newcastle in 2007 at a cost of £55million and has been at odds with the fans almost ever since. Mike Ashley may give Alan Pardew the chop if Newcastle United lose to Stoke City on Monday night . He had so far been meeting a fans campaign demanding Pardew’s exit with defiance. The former West Ham boss was odds on with bookmakers to be the next Premier League manager to lose his job, but those odds had changed following a dramatic late comeback to get a draw against Hull last weekend, followed by a Capital Cup win at Crystal Palace. And if Ashley was joking, it will not be seen as very funny by his manager, who is striving to regain some stability at a club who are bottom of the Premier League table. The report says Ashley was leaning against the wall of The Golden Lion pub in Soho’s Dean Street, enjoying a drink with a friend, when the exchange happened. A man with a reputation for flambouyant dealing in the city - this week he bought £43m worth of Tesco shares - he can be colourful when he is out. He was once seen on TV downing a pint of lager in one go at an Arsenal game. Asked about whether he had told Pardew about his decision or lined up a replacement, Ashley is reported to have said: ‘That’s all I’m prepared to say about it and now that I’ve said it, it’s out there. You can do what you want with it. There’s only so much I can take.’ Ashley and Pardew held clear-the-air talks two weeks ago after Newcastle had been thrashed 4-0 at Southampton. The owner sanctioned £25m of spending in the summer, including paying £12m for Remy Cabella from Montpellier, and £6m to Ajax for Siem de Jong. Supporters held posters demanding that Alan Pardew be sacked as Newcastle United manager last week . Alan Pardew is wanted out by the majority of the Newcastle United fans after five games without a victory .","Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has denied he was being serious in saying manager Alan Pardew could lose his job if they lose to Stoke on Monday .

"Mike Phillips has promised not to give up his Wales jersey without a fight after the selection panel sent a warning to their under-performing Lions stars ahead of the second Test against South Africa. The coaching staff are ready to wield the axe and Phillips, the 31-year-old scrum-half, is among a group of senior players who could pay the price for Saturday’s humiliating 38-16 defeat in Durban. Wales have some exciting prospects – including No 9s Gareth Davies, 23, Rhodri Williams, 21 and the injured Rhys Webb, 25 – waiting in the wings but Phillips is ready to turn up the heat to keep his place in the starting XV. Defiant: Mike Phillips won't give up his jersey without a fight . ‘It is always tough and we have good competition throughout the squad, and particularly at nine,’ said Phillips. ‘Gareth Davies did really well we he came on last week, which is great for him. I am being pushed all the way but it is great to have competition; you have to relish it. ‘No-one takes the jersey for granted and everyone knows Gatland will have no hesitation putting big names on the bench. The performance last week was not good enough for the jersey and what we represent. We are feeling under pressure for our places, when you lose you are there to be shot at.’ Phillips will discover his fate at Thursday’s team announcement in Nelspruit, where the tourists will arrive after a short stopover in Cape Town. Wales had just one training session to prepare for the opening Test, but preparations are well underway for the series-decider at the Mbombela Stadium. Below par: Phillips admits the performance against South Africa was not up to scratch . There can be no repeat of the display on the Eastern Cape and defence coach Shaun Edwards admitted Wales were ill-prepared for the tour opener. ‘It is an excuse but we only trained together once last week,’ said Edwards. ‘We were intent on preparing the Tuesday team and getting them up to speed after what had happened in the Probables vs Possibles game, so we had only one training session with the first team and the captain’s run on Friday. Ill-prepared: Shaun Edwards admits Wales were not ready for the first Test . ‘I hadn’t seen Jonathan Davies for three months, except for the Probables vs Possibles game. Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies had only played together for 20 minutes. 'We’ve been able to get some drilling in this week and hopefully we can get back to speed.’ Asked how Wales will deal with the threat of South Africa full-back Willie Le Roux, who was the standout performer in the opening Test, Edwards added: ‘I was thinking of locking him in the toilet before the game and getting a padlock for it.’","Under-performing Lions stars face battle for their places after poor showing .

"What starts as classical music in the mind of Mauricio Pochettino could morph into death metal if Sergio Aguero, the striker he considers the best in the world, ruins another day for Tottenham. Curiously, the Spurs manager might still find a way to enjoy it, judging from the praise he shovelled on the Argentine in his pre-match briefing. Perhaps flattery is the only way to disarm a finisher who Pochettino rates higher than any other and whose three goals contributed to the two drubbings handed out by Manchester City to Tottenham last season. VIDEO scroll down to watch Mauricio Pochettino: Previous Man City results are just history . When Sergio Aguero plays football it is like classical music according to Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino . 'Everything you have to have as a striker, he has,' says Pochettino of the Argentina forward . Those 5-1 and 6-0 beatings, inflicted on Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood, have come to embody Tottenham’s desperate weakness against the top four sides of the Barclays Premier League. Pochettino, sensibly, cites that those debacles did not happen on his watch, but his significant task at the Etihad Stadium today is ensuring that the striker who evokes Mozart in his mind doesn’t make a fool of him in the way he has Tottenham’s previous two managers. ‘When Aguero plays it is like classical music in my head,’ Pochettino said. ‘It is unbelievable. I think he is the best striker in the world. For me, he is. I love Aguero. ‘It’s like Mozart. Seriously. It is positive. Beethoven is too crazy. Aguero scored three times in two games against Tottenham last year as City took Spurs apart twice . Pochettino says neither Lionel Messi (right) or Cristiano Ronaldo (left) are strikers like Aguero . ‘For me, Aguero is the best. (Lionel Messi) is not a striker striker, Cristiano Ronaldo is not a striker striker, but Aguero is a striker. For me he is the best. Everything you have to have as a striker, he has. ‘He is Argentinian like me but I am not biased. He is the best. We need to make it difficult for him, to make the game difficult, to avoid the possibilities of him scoring.’ Aguero has already notched five in the Barclays Premier League this season, only four less than Tottenham’s entire squad. Other numbers are equally grim for Spurs, not the least of which is the statistic that shows they have taken only two points from 10 games against last season’s top four sides. Aguero has already scored six times in just nine games this season as City seek to retain their title . Pochettino says Spurs have not watched last season's defeats, when Aguero helped put them to the sword . It is, perhaps, why Pochettino referenced the primary ‘need to show we can compete with a team like Manchester City’, though he has deliberately avoided all video evidence of their failure to do that last season. ‘You need to keep the good memories and good feelings and put the bad feelings and bad memories away,’ he said. ‘That is important. We need to keep the good feelings to improve. The past is the past.’","Spurs boss Pochettino says he 'loves' Manchester City striker .

"The best of the Bar? Patrick Hennessey, a former Army officer, has topped a list of the most attractive barristers in Britain . They're used to vying for victory in the courtroom but now Britain's top legal brains have another competition on their hands. A list of the 21 most attractive male barristers in Britain has become the talk of the Bar following its publication online by two anonymous women who 'love a man in a wig'. Patrick Hennessey, based at 39 Essex Street chambers, tops the list, with the Oxford-educated former Army officer described as: 'Like Prince Harry but with brains'. Behind him at number two is Harvard-educated Derrick Dale QC, known as 'a charmer of the old school variety who is more suited to the silver screen than the bar', while the number three spot taken by Nick Wilkinson, a divorce specialist who is dating Prince William's ex-girlfriend Olivia Hunt and is the son of the Court of Appeal's Lady Justice Hallett. Justin Ageros, number 20 on the list, is said to be 'a manly man - like a fire-fighter stuffed into an M&S suit.' It's not just the younger men who come out triumphant in the latest battle of the legal egos. Orlando Pownall, 60, place ninth, is described as: 'a silver fox who has spent his life at the criminal bar fighting the good fight. 'He’s like Victor Lazlo in Casablanca, but with sex appeal.' For the sake of equality, the list will soon be followed by a compilation of the most attractive female barristers, the founders said. Mr Hennessey, who served with the Grenadier Guards and published books about his time in Afghanistan, told The Lawyer: 'Most unusually for a barrister, I’m speechless. Derrick Dale QC, left, takes the number two spot on the list while third place goes to Nick Wilkinson, right . Orlando Pownall, 60, makes the top ten, left, while Justin Ageros at number 20 is described as 'a manly man' 'It’s a tremendous honour and very reassuring to know that if the current misconceived and ham-fisted attempts at reform end up breaking the justice system altogether some of us at least have a sporting chance in an even older profession.' Mr Dale told the Daily Telegraph that he was flattered and had been deluged with emails since the list, entitled Your Barrister Boyfriend, appeared on Tumblr. Daniel Mount QC, who was ranked as the fifth most attractive barrister, told The Lawyer that he had competition for his wife's gaze from further down the list in the shape of Rory Dunlop. Daniel Beard QC, left, makes the list at five but joked that his wife preferred Rory Dunlop, right, at number 17 . Human rights lawyer Wayne Jordash, left, hits number four while Ronnie Dennis, right, makes number seven . 'I just can’t say how enormously proud I am to have made this list,' he said. 'For any barrister this is the pinnacle. Unfortunately my wife says she prefers number 17.'

"An Oregon mother says she got sick after eating at Olive Garden and the illness forced her to undergo a Caesarian section instead of a natural birth. Now, 34-year-old Miranda Fischer of Tigard is suing the company for $50,000 in damages. According to the lawsuit filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Ms Fischer and her husband Erandi Saucedo ate lunch with 11 other relatives at the location in Salem, Oregon on January 21. Too sick: Miranda Fischer of Tigard, Oregon is suing Olive Garden after she got so sick she couldn't go through a natural birth and needed a Caesarian section. Pictured with her first child above. Contaminated: Ms Fischer and her husband had lunch with 11 of their friends and family members at this Olive Garden restaurant in Salem, Oregon . Within 36 hours, 13 people who ate at the restaurant, including Ms Fischer and her husband, became sick with gastrointestinal symptoms. When Ms Fischer went into labor soon after, she started suffering nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration in the hospital. Doctors discovered that her baby was in the breech position, but Ms Fischer was too sick and dehydrated for them to turn the baby for a normal head-first delivery so they were forced to perform a Caesarian section instead. 'They couldn't do it,' her lawyer Thomas Patton told the Oregonian. 'They just knocked her out and went ahead with an emergency Cesarian . Contagion: Norovirus is a very contagious illness which causes the stomach and intestines to become inflamed. Above, what the virus looks like under a microscope . Also known as the Winter Vomiting Bug in the UK, norovirus is a very contagious illness that causes the stomach and intestines to become inflamed. Symptoms of norovirus include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain, fever, headache and body aches. Norovirus can also cause dehydration which can result in a decrease in urination, dry mouth and throat and feeling dizzy when standing up. Norovirus is sometimes described as food poisoning or the stomach flu, which is incorrect. While food poisoning can be a result of norovius, other germs and chemicals can cause food poisoning as well. Noroviris is spread by accidentally ingesting the stool of an infected person. This usually happens by eating food contaminated with the virus, touching something contaminated with the virus or having contact with someone already infected. Past outbreaks of norovirus have been linked to leafy greens, fresh fruit and shellfish but any food served raw or exposed to the virus after being cooked can become contaminated. CDC . At the same time Ms Fischer was delivering her baby, her husband was also experiencing the food poisoning-like symptoms and couldn't support his wife through labor the way he would if he were healthy. Blood tests later confirmed that Ms Fischer was infected with the norovirus. Its unclear whether the same tests were performed on her husband, but she was the only person diagnosed with the virus. While both parents and the baby are fine, the family is suing the company for negligence, saying the restaurant failed to maintain health standards which lead to Ms Fischer getting sick and having a C-section. Both parents out: Ms Fischer's husband Erandi Saucedo (pictured with their first child) also got sick and was not much help with his wife in labor because he was dealing with his own symptoms . In the lawsuit they say the Olive Garden failed to make sure employees washed their hands, or that the food was properly cleaned, prepared and cooked. They also say that the restaurant allowed a staff member to work while infected with the virus. The claim is currently pending with Liberty Mutual, the restaurant's insurance company. Speading: There was a recent outbreak of gastrointestinal illness on a Royal Caribbean ship due back in port today and norovirus is the suspected culprit. Above, the ship docked in the U.S. Virgin Islands on Sunday . But a spokesman for Darden, Olive Garden's parent company, says they are not to blame. 'We don't have any indication that this lady contracted norovirus at our restaurant or that norovirus caused her to have a C-section,' spokesman Rich Jeffers said. 'We don't have any indication of a norovirus outbreak in January 2013.' There was an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness on a Royal Carribean cruise ship this month that caused more than 300 of the 4,000 on board to get sick and norovirus is the suspected culprit. That ship, The Explorer of the Seas, is due back in port in New Jersey today, two days earlier than its scheduled 10-day cruise.","Miranda Fischer, 34, claims she caught norovirus after eating at the restaurant on January 21 .

Four goals in six matches suggest he has enjoyed starting as a central striker under Arsene Wenger and Bruce is unsurprised. 'I rang his brother (and agent, Chris) but there was some rather big clubs in for him,' said Bruce, whose side take on the Gunners at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. 'I think Spurs were in there, Arsenal as well of course, and one or two from Europe as well. 'He had a pick shall we say but, yes, we had a dabble. 'I've got no doubt in my mind after working with him that he can play at any top four side, no question. He's a top player. 'He's played a lot on the left (for United) and then people start criticising his goalscoring record, but you put him down the middle as a striker and he will score.'

Bruce, as a former Red Devils captain, was surprised to see his old club cash in on one of their brightest homegrown talents but understands the dilemma Louis van Gaal faced balancing his forward options. 'They've made changes at United and decided he's surplus but I believe he can play in any top team around Europe,' said Bruce. 'When you've got (Wayne) Rooney, (Robin) van Persie and (Radamel) Falcao you've got a decision to make but it surprised me because not often do you see Manchester United selling a very good young player.

"Vigilantes stormed a nightclub in western Peru, whipped prostitutes into the street and forced male employess to do press-ups in a farcical attempt to combat the region's sex industry. A video of the disturbance, taken in Cajamarca nightclub Alondra ('Skylark'), shows the masked self-appointed moral guardians chase dozens of scantily-clad women from the club, whipping and shoving them. It was shot by the Decentralised Committee of Urban Rounds of Cajamarca, a local vigilante group, and distributed to local media. Attack: A vigilante whips a woman in an 'anti-prostitution' raid on a Peruvian nightclub . Strange punishment: The gang of vigilantes force the male employees to do press-ups, hitting them as they do . Some 50 women, many of them crying, were seen fleeing the building as the vigilantes lashed them with whips. They were then forced, barefoot and half-naked, to stand against the wall in a line and berated by their attackers. The video also showed the group members fighting with men who emerged from the club and forcing club employees to do push ups. According to local media, the group said that it conducts these kinds of operations to eradicate prostitution and crime. El Comercio reported that the group stormed the nightclub after receiving a tip-off that several thieves were hiding there. The scantily-clad women, some of them desperately trying to cover themselves, flee their attackers . The group's spokesman, Fernando Chuquilín,  justified their actions as an effort to eradicate prostitution and crime. Prostitution is legal for women over 18 years of age in Peru if they register with municipal authorities and carry a health certificate. Brothels must be licensed, but the vast majority of prostitutes work outside of official regulation. Many police officers tolerate the operation of unlicensed brothels. Many of the women were weeping at the savage treatment they received from the masked men . Fear: One of the women in the club stumbles as she is forced out into the street . Another video posted by the group yesterday shows them hitting the 'Ula Ula' nightclub in the Santa Elena neighborhood. They again beat the workers and forced the men to exercise but also torched chairs, sound equipment and lights in the street. The vigilantes, it was reported, had to frantically beat out the flames to prevent them from reaching power lines.

"Adnan Januzaj is determined to establish himself at the heart of Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United despite being marginalised under the new manager. Januzaj emerged as a shining light amid the gloom of David Moyes’ time in charge and was rewarded with a five-year contract worth £50,000-a-week exactly a year ago. But the 19-year-old Belgium forward has yet to start a game under Van Gaal, making all six of his first-team appearances this season off the bench while playing for the club’s Under 21 team. Adnan Januzaj is determined to fight for his place at Manchester United . The Belgian teenager has not started a match this season after making his breakthrough last term . However, Januzaj will stay and fight for a place at Old Trafford and is ready to compete with Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata for the No 10 role. ‘We want to stay,’ said the teenager’s agent Dirk de Vries. ‘Adnan wants to gain experience in England as No 10 — he doesn’t fear the competition.

Januzaj wants to challenge Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney (R) for United's No 10 jersey . ‘Just like anyone else he wants to play but he will wait for his opportunity. He is a super professional and he is still motivated, even when he has to play for the Under 21s. ‘We’re not angry. We know the club is very happy with him and they want to keep Adnan for the rest of his career at Old Trafford. They believe in him, otherwise he wouldn’t be handed the No 11 of Ryan Giggs. ‘We have to wait until Van Gaal gives him a chance. But we cannot look into the Dutchman’s head and know what he thinks. I believe Adnan plays well at this moment and I’ve heard that he could start the game on Monday.’ United manager Louis van Gaal is yet to put his faith in the 19-year-old who has been turning out for the U21s . Van Gaal has preferred to start with United's big money signings Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria (R) Alex Vervecken, the United scout credited with discovering Januzaj at Anderlecht, believes United’s £150million summer spending spree has left Van Gaal with no choice but to pick the big-name stars. ‘Adnan has still all of his qualities,’ said Vervecken. ‘He will get his chance. Even if he didn’t play for a year, he will stay. Maybe, the problem is that United have started winning games now and Van Gaal focuses on his new guys — Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao. They have to play. The competition is extremely hard. Even Fellaini doesn’t play and it’s even difficult to make it into the squad. Also, if United were in Europe or the League Cup, Januzaj would have more opportunities.’","Adnan Januzaj is determined to fight for his place at Manchester United .

"Ever struggle to stay motivated when planning a trip to the gym? Well, it way not be your fault - it may all be down to the way your brain's wired. Scientists have pinpointed the region of the brain that is responsible for exercise motivation. While the finding could one day lead to a way of encouraging people to be fit and healthy, researchers say it could also be used to create better treatments for depression. Scientists have pinpointed the region of the brain that is responsible for exercise motivation, which many people struggle with and make excuses for dodging the gym (stock image).  Experts from Seattle Children’s Research discovered that the dorsal medial habenula controls the desire to exercise in mice . Eric Turner and Yun-Wei Hsu, of Seattle Children’s Research Institute’s Centre for Integrative Brain Research, discovered that the dorsal medial habenula controls the desire to exercise in mice. The structure of the habenula is similar in humans and rodents and these basic functions in mood regulation and motivation are likely to be the same across species, they explained. The knowledge that such a specific area of the brain may be responsible for motivation to exercise could help researchers develop more targeted, effective treatments for depression. Exercise is known to be the most effective non-pharmaceutical therapy for melancholy. The structure of the habenula (illustrated) is similar in humans and rodents and these basic functions in mood regulation and motivation are likely to be the same across species, they explained . While the finding could one day lead to a way of encouraging people to be fit and healthy, researchers think it could be used to create better treatments for depression (illustrated in this stock image) The dorsal media habenula is a tiny area of the brain that is responsible for exercise motivation. It has been found to control the desire to exercise in mice. The structure of the habenula is similar in humans and rodents. The knowledge that such a specific area of the brain may be responsible for motivation to exercise could help researchers develop more targeted, effective treatments for depression. Past studies have attributed many different functions to the habenula. A 2010 study revealed that the habenula plays a key role in helping animals survive in a world full of hidden rewards and dangers, by helping them make the best choices. It inhibits dopamine-releasing neurons when an animal fails to obtain a reward and is involved in behavioural responses to pain, stress, anxiety, sleep and reward. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain's reward and pleasure centres. The habenula’s dysfunction is associated with depression, schizophrenia and psychosis. ‘Changes in physical activity and the inability to enjoy rewarding or pleasurable experiences are two hallmarks of major depression,’ Dr Turner said. ‘But the brain pathways responsible for exercise motivation have not been well understood. Now, we can seek ways to manipulate activity within this specific area of the brain without impacting the rest of the brain’s activity.’ The research, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, used mice that were genetically engineered to block signals from the dorsal medial habenula. Dr Turner's team collaborated with experts at the University of Washington to show that the genetically engineered mice were lethargic and ran far less than typical mice, which love to run in their exercise wheels. The genetically engineered mice also lost their preference for drinking sugary water. ‘Without a functioning dorsal medial habenula, the mice became couch potatoes,’ Dr Turner said. ‘They were physically capable of running but appeared unmotivated to do it.’ In another group of mice, the team activated the dorsal medial habenula using laser technology called optogenetics. The mice could choose to activate this area of the brain by turning one of two wheels with their paws. The scientists found that the mice ‘strongly preferred’ turning the wheel that stimulated the dorsal medial habenula, which they say demonstrate that this area is linked to rewarding behaviour.","Scientists from Seattle Children's Research Institute discovered that the dorsal medial habenula controls the desire to exercise in mice .

"Wolves returned to winning ways by beating promotion rivals Middlesbrough thanks to Bakary Sako’s cheeky penalty and Nouha Dicko’s brilliant solo goal. Boro hadn’t suffered defeat for seven Championship matches but were undone as Sako chipped in from 12 yards and Dicko dribbled through to slam into the roof of the net. It was a first win in five games for Kenny Jackett’s team as they moved to fourth, although there was a sour note as Sako picked up a groin injury and Dicko limped off with a dead leg. Wolves frontman Nouha Dicko is brought down in the area under the challenge of defender George Friend . Bakary Sako keeps his cool to chip his penalty from the spot to give Wolves the lead at Molineux . Sako's impressive 'Panenka' penalty set Wolves on their way to three points in Tuesday's Championship clash . Wolves (4-2-3-1): Ikeme 7; Doherty 6, Batth 7, Ebanks-Landell 7, Rowe 6; McDonald 7, Evans 6.5; Henry 7, Edwards 6.5, Sako 7 (Jacobs 63mins, 5.5); Dicko 7.5 (Clarke 78, 5). Subs not used: Flatt, Golbourne, Stearman, Sagbo, Ricketts. Scorers: Sako (pen), 33, Dicko, 73. Booked: Ebanks-Landell. Middlesbrough (4-4-2): Konstantopoulos 6.5; Fredericks 6, Ayala 6, Omeruo 6, Friend 5; Adomah 7, Whitehead 6.5, Leadbitter 6.5, Reach 6 (Tomlin 65, 5); Vossen 6.5 (Wildschut 76, 5), Bamford 6.5 (Kike 65, 5.5). Subs not used: Gibson, Nsue, Veljkovic, Mejias. Booked: Leadbitter. Attendance: 18, 391 . Referee: Carl Berry 6.5. Man of match: Nouha Dicko. Kenny Jackett rates Sako’s chances of making Saturday’s trip to Leeds at evens, but Dicko should recover in time. The pair are fast forming one of the Championship’s deadliest duos and now have 11 goals between them. Aitor Karanka was furious his side had failed to heed his warning about the pair. ‘I’m disappointed because the players lacked intensity and we knew their main dangers were Sako and Dicko,’ he said. Dicko’s goal 17 minutes from the end was reward for a fine performance. Collecting the ball from Dave Edwards on the left he cut in between two Boro defenders and finished emphatically. Dicko also won the penalty for the opening goal. Sako slipped the ball through to the 22-year-old on the edge of the box and in desperation to avert the danger George Friend got too close, giving Dicko reason to fall. Referee Carl Berry gave it. Sako stepped up and dinked a Panenka penalty that Andrea Pirlo would have been proud of. It was his seventh goal of the season. He is out of contract next summer and Wolves are anxious to tie down their star player. Of equal concern is the fact both players could be off to the African Cup of Nations in January to represent Mali. ‘We want forwards who have good reputations,’ said Jackett. Goalscorer Sako shows his delight at scoring and is congratulated by Wolves team-mate Dave Edwards . Wolves had been stuttering a little and dramatically collapsed in their last match at Millwall to draw from 3-0 up. Those late goals brought the total conceded in their previous four games to 11, having begun the campaign letting in only three in eight. They were much tighter last night. Boro did put Wolves under pressure after the opening goal, and Jackett was annoyed his team seemed to slack off. First Patrick Bamford set up Jelle Vossen, whose half-volley wasn’t the cleanest but looped over Ikeme and onto the crossbar. Then Vossen played in Bamford, who fired a strong shot that Ikeme punched to Vossen. His strike hit Ethan Ebanks-Landell and as appeals for handball went up from the visitors Bamford tested Ikeme again. Soon after, Ikeme held from Vossen’s header. The Wolves’ goalkeeper almost allowed an equaliser after the interval, however, slipping as he caught Adomah’s cross and taking the ball perilously close to crossing the line. Boro appealed in vain. Wolves reacted and twice went close. Lee Evans somehow contrived to miss when James Henry’s free-kick from the left found him inside the six-yard box. Dave Edwards then sent his downwards header into the post from the same position when picked out by Henry from the other flank. Dicko doubled Kenny Jackett's side's lead with 13 minutes to go as Wolves moved up to fourth in the table .","Wolves move up to fourth in Championship table with victory .

"Police have identified the mother of 'Baby Hope', a little girl whose body was found dumped in a cooler off a New York highway more than two decades ago. NYPD cold case detectives had renewed their investigation this summer after highway workers in 1991 found the child, believed to be between . three and five years old, tied with rope . and squeezed into a picnic cooler beneath full cans of Coca-Cola, off the Henry Hudson Parkway. New information was revealed today after authorities received a tip from a woman who believes she knows the sister of 'Baby Hope'. Scroll down for video . Missing: Police recently handed out this poster. The first picture is a current, age-progression sketch of Baby Hope, the second is the sketch released in 1991, and the third photo is of the cooler which the child was found inside . Write caption he . Grisly discovery: The cooler containing Baby Hope was found in Washington Heights, on an embankment off the Henry Hudson Parkway . Police have conducted follow-up interviews and confirmed the mother's identity using scientific evidence, a source told the New York Times. No names were being released as the case remains a murder investigation and no charges have been brought so far. In . July, around the 22nd anniversary of the unsolved case, police . circulated the neighborhood around Dyckman Street in Washington Heights . near the wooded area where the child was found, speaking to residents . and offering a $12,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest . and conviction. The little girl had been malnourished and tests showed she had endured sexual abuse and she died of asphyxia. She was naked except for a hair-tie with yellow plastic baubles on it. She had black hair and was white, possibly Hispanic. The child was badly decomposed, making . her facial features unrecognizable, and no one came forward to claim . her. No one had filed a missing persons report and there were very few . clues. According to police sources on Monday, someone called the tip line in July claiming to have spoken to a woman whose sister had been killed. Hopeful: Locals examine a poster put up by police in July 2013 in the area where Baby Hope was found in New York City . Outpouring: (Left) The gravesite of Baby Hope, paid for by the NYPD's 34th Precinct and (right) a sketch of what Baby Hope may have looked like . Even for hardened New York City cops, the case was a sad and grisly one. Detectives named the girl 'Baby Hope', in the hope that someone would come forward and help them find out who she was and what happened to her. Two years after her discovery, Baby Hope was buried in St Hamond's ceremony. The police of the 34th Precinct pooled their money and paid for her gravestone. She was buried in a white communion dress. Years passed, and still no one came forward. In 2007, Baby Hope's body was exhumed to try and extract a DNA sample, but her bones were in such bad condition it was impossible. A second attempt in 2011, using improved technology yielded a complete DNA profile, and police immediately ran a check on all their convicted felon and missing persons databases but came up empty-handed. Changing neighborhood: Washington Heights has one of the lowest crime rates in Manhattan, but in the '80s and early '90s, when Baby Hope was killed, the area was deeply affected by a crack cocaine epidemic and gang activity . 'It's hard for me to believe that nobody knows who she is,' Detective Joseph Neenan told The New York Times in 1991. The officer in charge of the case, he was accustomed to searching for missing persons. 'We have the opposite,' he said. 'We have her. We don't know who she is.' Now, 22 years later, Detective Robert Dewhurst echoes him: . 'I feel somebody knows who this girl was,' he told the New York Daily News. Hope: Police canvass the neighborhood in Washington Heights where the little girl's body was found 22 years ago . Perhaps Baby Hope 'had little girlfriends that are grown now and know something wasn’t right on the block when she was gone'. 'Everything about this case is already out there,' Sergeant Carlos Nieves, a police spokesman, told The New York Times. “They’re hoping that somebody who hasn’t come out sees this.' At the time of Baby Hope's death in 1991, Washington Heights was in the thrall of a crack cocaine epidemic and the area was known for gangs and violence. Now, it has one of the lowest crime rates in Manhattan and families with young children walk the streets with impunity. There are a lot of new faces, but police are optimistic that some of the older members of the community remember the case of Baby Hope.","Girl was found dead in a picnic cooler off a Manhattan freeway in 1991 .

"The biggest surprise about FA general secretary Alex Horne leaving after 11 years with English football’s ruling body is that no scandal or controversy accompanies his departure. Horne’s four predecessors - Ian Watmore, Brian Barwick , Mark Palios and Adam Crozier - either walked out (in Watmore’s case after just nine months) or were forced out. However Horne, 42, appears to be leaving his £580,000-a-year post at the end of January for the reason he gave in his statement on Tuesday: ‘The time is right for me to look for a change of direction.’ Alex Horne has left his post as FA general secretary after 11 years with English football's ruling body . With a City background, he will be able to match or better his FA salary, which made him the best-paid chief of any UK sports governing body. And his CV, that includes the opening of Wembley and St George’s Park, winning the Euro 2022 final and steering a very turbulent organisation into calmer waters, looks good. But there is conjecture outside Wembley that FA chairman Greg Dyke is looking to reform the management as one of his strategic initiatives after the England Commission and Horne might have decided that this is the right time for a parting of the ways. Horne, a methodical and organised executive, would have found Dyke, who shoots from the hip and tends to make up his mind on the hoof, a more difficult chairman to work with than his predecessor David Bernstein. Horne's reign has included the opening of Wembley and England winning the right to host the Euro 2022 final .

"The Chancellor weighed in to the row over the handling of the Queen’s finances last night, branding criticism of the Royal Household ‘unfair’. George Osborne spoke as several Tory MPs yesterday accused the Public Accounts Committee of ‘meanness’ and ‘grandstanding’ in a report in  which it criticised courtiers for failing to balance the books and leaving dozens of royal residences in a state of disrepair. ‘I think the Public Accounts Committee chair is being unfair to the way the Royal Household has managed its finances,’ Mr Osborne said. Chancellor George Osborne said criticism of the Royal Family's finances was 'unfair' after a committee of MPs said the Queen should rent out her palaces . ‘They’ve lived within a frozen budget . over the last years and indeed the cost to the Royal Family for the . taxpayer has come down quite sharply over the last couple of decades.’ The committee’s chairman Margaret Hodge had said the Queen should open up Buckingham Palace to the public for longer and consider money-spinning ventures such as renting it out for commercial events. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the PAC, said people were reluctant to criticise the royal finances . But yesterday Mr Osborne said her committee appeared to have ignored significant savings made by the Royal Family in recent years. He added: ‘Let’s not forget, not only are they a very important part of our constitution, but they are a huge attraction for tourists all around the world – the Royal Family generate a huge revenue for this country.’ Senior royal aides said the backlog of building works has come about because of a real-terms squeeze on their funding of up to 60 per cent over the past 20 years. They were backed by several Tory MPs, including Jacob Rees-Mogg who said it was ‘bizarre’ the committee was focusing on royal expenditure of about £35million rather than Government spending of £700billion. ‘One has to wonder if it is possible that the reason they are spending so much time on such a trivial sum is because of the opportunities it affords for grandstanding,’ he said. ‘There is a meanness in saying this is all very expensive – it is not.’ Nadine Dorries said: ‘What I am totally against is this out-and-out yearly attack of the Royal Family because of who they are. 'They are great for Britain, the British people love them. I actually felt quite embarrassed listening to Margaret Hodge reel off the list of repairs that need doing to the royal buildings that we have not funded as a country, because what the Royal Family does for us is beyond explanation. ‘They put this little island of England on the world map.’ Repair work: Commons watchdogs insist the royals need more money-spinning ventures to stop their palaces crumbling after years of complacency . Tory MP Michael Ellis said: ‘I am sure the idea of opening up public access more will be looked at, but by the time the cost of extra security and so on has been included I doubt it would make much difference. ‘What is needed is a proper consideration of the royal finances... after years in which the Civil List was frozen by Blair and Brown.’ The report highlighted what is claimed to be repeated overspending by palace officials, forcing them to repeatedly dip into the Queen’s reserves. It also made great play of the fact 40 per cent of royal property – including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle – are of ‘below acceptable’ standard. Labour’s Mrs Hodge told the Mail she was shocked by the ‘complacency’ of palace staff, adding that they ‘are not serving the monarch well at all’. She also asked why, given the backlog of works, £1.1million of public money was found to renovate the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s home at Kensington Palace as well as an apartment for Princess Beatrice. In need of repair: The backlog of repairs is so great it will cost at least £50million to restore the Queen¿s London residence (pictured in 2007) and other historic buildings .

"Slavisa Jokanovic will be hoping to stop the revolving door to the Watford manager's office, but he was not helped by Michail Antonio scoring a double for Nottingham Forest to twice come from behind. Swapping four managers in 37 days had not stopped Watford topping the table ahead of the match and they dominated their opponents. Jokanovic's appointment came out the left field – Chelsea once paid £1.7million for him when he was a defensive midfielder – and the 46-year-old's managerial career has taken him to Serbia, Thailand, Bulgaria and Spain. Michail Antonio nods home at the back post for Nottingham Forest to seal them a point at Vicarage Road . Watford (4-3-3): Gomes 5; Paredes 6, Ekstrand 5, Bassong 5.5 (Hoban 84), Pudil 5; Tozser 5, Abdi 4 (Murray 50, 5), Munari 6; Forestieri 7.5, Vydra 7.5; Ighalo 7 (Doyley 65, 5).

Jokanovic only took charge of his first Watford game on Saturday – a 3-0 win away to Sheffield Wednesday – and has not had long with the side, but he is already getting them to play slick football. In the opening half-an-hour, it was pulling Nottingham Forest apart. On 20 minutes the ball moved swiftly from Daniel Pudil to Fernando Forestieri to Matej Vydra, who took a touch before trying to poke the ball past Forest goalkeeper Karl Darlow. Only his legs stopped the ball from going in. Another flowing move set up Vydra again in the 27th minute. Daniel Tozser sprayed a ball out to the left to Forestieri who cushioned it first-time into the path of the Watford striker on the edge of the box, but he was again denied by Darlow. Two minutes later, one of their fine passages of play was finally rewarded. This time Almen Abdi crossed, Gianni Munari helped the ball on with a lovely flick with the back of his heel and Odion Ighalo put the ball in from close range. Odion Ighalo put the home side ahead in the first half with a crisp finish from close range past Karl Darlow . Ighalo celebrates his fourth Championship goal of the season after making it 1-0 in the 28th minute of the game . It was such a shame, then, that all Watford's work was undone by diabolical defending in their own half, to allow Forest to equalise within another two minutes. Abdi passed straight to opposition winger Michail Antonio 30 yards from goal and he ran at Joel Ekstrand, left him for dead on the edge of the box before finishing low past Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes. Forestieri twice forced Darlow into parrying awkward swerving efforts and sent another dipping narrowly over the bar. So when the half-time whistle blew, Jokanovic could be forgiven for feeling frustrated with the scores level. Antonio is congratulated by his team-mates after making it 1-1 with an angled finish in the first half . Matej Vydra points to the stands after putting Watford back in front from the penalty spot in the second half . Watford started the second half in the manner in which they played the first – dominating their opponents. And it did not take long until they went ahead, in the 52nd minute. Another rapid, flowing break ended with Forestieri crossing low to Vydra who was about to score from six yards out when he tangled with Forest defender Kelvin Wilson and a penalty was awarded. Vydra got back up to stroke the spot kick into the bottom right corner, with Darlow flying in the other direction, for his fifth goal in seven games. But again, on 67 minutes, poor play at the back cos the home side and left Antonio unmarked at the back post to power in Burke's cross to level. But Antonio has the last laugh as he sneaks in at the back post to make it 2-2 and grab a point for Forest .","Odion Ighalo put Watford ahead from close range but Michail Antonio equalised for Nottingham Forest with an angled shot two minutes later .

"A young vicar nicknamed 'The Bush' on account of his afro hairdo was singled out by Manchester United fans at Old Trafford chanting 'there's only one Marouane Fellaini'. The crowds spotted the likeness Reverend Simon Rose bears to the Man Utd midfielder, singing 'Fellaini give us a wave'. The 26-year-old, who became the youngest religious minister in Nottingham when he joined the church in November, said he cannot go anywhere without people mistaking him for the footballer. Scroll down for video . Reverend Simon Rose, left, said he is constantly being mistaken from the Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini, right, on account of his afro hairdo . The Nottingham Forrest fan recently . visited Old Trafford with a friend, when the crowds turned on him, . joking that Fellaini, who also plays for the Belgian national side, was . sitting in the stands. But the good-humoured minister said he takes it all in his stride and doesn't mind the comparison with the football star. Rev Rose, from Ruddington, said: 'I can’t go anywhere now without two or three people shouting ""Fellaini"" at me. 'Although . I’m a Nottingham Forest fan I went to watch Man United against West Ham . last month - half the crowd were singing ""Fellaini, give us a wave"", . and ""there’s only one Marouane Fellaini"".

'I’ve been called The Bush since school because my hair has always been like this - but now it’s just constant Fellaini comparisons. 'Some people have really had to double-take because they think I’m actually him. But I’m far from being a red-devil, that’s for sure. 'It’s a bit embarrassing but I take it in good humour all the time - you have to really. 'I do enjoy playing football but I’m not very good. I wouldn’t mind having his talents but for now I’m quite happy in my job as a minister.' Rev Rose is one of only 18 Methodist ministers under the age of 30 in the UK - there are 2,185 in total. The married vicar, whose Twitter name is @Simonrosebush, said he found his calling from God while studying business management at the University of Nottingham. Rev Rose said: 'I do enjoy playing football but I'm not very good. I wouldn't mind having his talents but for now I'm quite happy with my job as a minister' After graduating in 2008, he decided to become a local preacher before training to become a fully-qualified Methodist minister. Rev Rose added: 'Some people are surprised by my age but I think people are getting used to it now. 'When I was carol singing in Bradmore in December, someone asked me whose son I was and I said ""I am actually the new minister"". 'They apologised quite quickly and we had a bit of a laugh.'

"Arsene Wenger may have officially become an OAP at 65 but there are still one or two scores he has to settle before he actually contemplates retirement. He goes into tonight’s Champions League tie against Anderlecht at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium with enough problems to add to his worry lines — not least exposing 22-year-old Emiliano Martinez to a Champions League debut when his most recent competitive match was in the Championship last season. But despite being old enough to qualify for a bus pass, Wenger still has a point to prove in Europe, famously never having won the Champions League despite contesting it 16 times with Arsenal and twice with Monaco. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsenal not reaching potential - Wenger . Arsene Wenger takes a look around Anderlecht's Constant Vanden Stock Stadium ahead of the game . Wenger is hopeful that Jack Wilshere will be fit to play against Anderlecht, on the manager's 65th birthday . David Ospina has been ruled out for three months after aggravating an old injury in his last outing for Arsenal . Arsene Wenger blamed the problem on the player being rushed back from injury while at his former club Nice . VIDEO Arsenal not reaching potential - Wenger . ‘Do I feel young?’ said Wenger. ‘No, my age is my age. You have to live with that. Until now I am lucky to be in shape. But the desire and motivation is stronger than ever. 'I am so keen to do well with my team this season. I want the club and the team to do as well as they can, it’s my dream. I want to give absolutely everything for my team to do it. ‘I am not a celebrator of birthdays. What is important is my team performs well and I will dedicate all my energy to get things right. 'There is a difference between the quality of our performances and points we have won. So we want to add to the quality of our performance, and get the points that we feel are there in the team. That little percentage, where we can improve, is vital.’ Wenger’s keeper crisis will be the key preoccupation tonight, with Martinez, replacing suspended Wojciech Szczesny, having conceded five goals in a Capital One Cup tie at Reading two years ago. Emiliano Martinez is now the only fit cover for Wojciech Szczesny in Wenger's injury-hit squad . Wenger remained upbeat about his squad despite the huge number of injuries effecting Arsenal . David Ospina joins the Arsenal injury list which also includes... Mesut Ozil, Olivier Giroud, Mathieu Debuchy,  Yaya Sanogo, Mikel Arteta and Laurent Koscielny, while Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott, Serge Gnabry and Jack Wilshere are all still struggling for fitness. And Martinez will have a job to do after tonight as the club’s temporary No 2 keeper, with Wenger revealing Colombian David Ospina will be out until the New Year in yet another Arsenal injury setback. Wenger said: ‘Ospina had his first injury at Nice (his former club), which was a knee problem, and I think he was a bit rushed back. He then got injured during the World Cup. And after that he came to us injured. ‘I had to bring him on against Galatasaray without a warm-up, without being prepared, and he had a recurrence of that injury. That means he is out for two to three months. Now we have to be really careful because he has a recurrence of a thigh injury that’s very difficult. It’s a long-term injury.’ At least Wenger can welcome back Aaron Ramsey against Anderlecht after he came through his substitute appearance against Hull on Saturday. The midfielder could start here in Brussels tonight along with Mikel Arteta, who also returned to the bench on Saturday. Martinez (left) is set to start for Arsenal in their game with Anderlecht as Josh Vickers also trained . Young keeper Matt Macey (left) also trained alongside Ryan Huddart (right) as Arsenal's crisis deepens . Arsenal were given a boost ahead of Wednesday's match as midfielder Aaron Ramsey was able to train . Arsene Wenger has had to call up young keepers Ryan Huddart, Josh Vickers, Matt Macey. Read more about Wenger's young keepers here. Jack Wilshere has backed Martinez to provide Arsenal with the stability they need against the Belgian champions. ‘He has grown up in the last two years, playing at Sheffield Wednesday on loan in the Championship, which is a very tough league to play in, especially in England as a foreign lad,’ said Wilshere. ‘We’re confident in him, we train with him every day, see what he can do and he’ll be ready.’ The England midfielder maintains that despite only having won four games all season, Arsenal will eventually dispel the notion they are a lightweight team. Arsenal's English stars were all smiles on the train to Belgium ahead of their Champions League tie . Theo Walcott also took part in training as he steps up his return from nine months out after a knee injury . ‘I think that’s unfair. Maybe we haven’t got the results we wanted in some games, or drawn when should have won, but if we look back we’ve had a positive start. 'Ok, we need more points than we have in the table, but going forward we are confident we can get the points we need. ‘We just ignore that criticism. We know what we can do in midfield. Maybe our strongest point is going forward, we know we can defend, we have players who can put their foot in and we have players who can organise in Flamini. 'We have good defensive players. We know on Saturday the performance wasn’t good enough.’","Arsene Wenger turns 65 on Wednesday, when Arsenal take on Anderlecht .

Spurs owner Daniel Levy wanted more, QPR wanted to pay less, but they've managed to work out a deal. Sandro was absent from the Tottenham squad that lost 3-0 against Liverpool at White Hart Lane, but Levy originally wanted double the original £8m fee that Redknapp paid in 2010.

"The man struck by media owner Alexander Lebedev could have suffered a life-threatening injury if it were not for his 'physical shape and paratrooper training', a Russian court heard today. Sergei Polonsky, 40, claimed that the newspaper baron 'hit me with his fist three times in my head' in testimony that the judge must consider in deciding whether to jail the tycoon for up to five years for 'hooliganism motivated by political hatred'. The notorious incident came in a TV talk show in 2011 after which the former KGB spy - who bought the Independent titles and London Evening Standard - claimed he acted in self-defence fearing he was about to be hit. Russian media magnate Alexander Lebedev, pictured left arriving at a court in Moscow, is on trial for allegedly punching businessman Sergei Polonsky, pictured right, because of political hatred . Show: Mr Lebedev (left) lashed out at Sergei Polonsky during a Russian TV debate in 2011 . Polonsky alleged that 53-year-old . Lebedev - an ex-KGB spy once based in London - used 'specialised . training and martial arts skills' during the sudden attack. But there was also farce at the . Moscow trial yesterday as the judge permitted property magnate . Polonsky's absence from the trial based on the fact he is on bail in . Cambodia and barred from leaving that country amid allegations he . assaulted a group of sailors and held them captive using a knife. However, there is growing evidence . that he absented himself from Cambodia around two months ago, and that . he is now in Israel, possibly in the area of Yavne, having earlier spent . time in Switzerland and Luxembourg. As judge Andrei Bakhvalov ruled that . Polonsky could not get out of Cambodia for 'extraordinary . circumstances', he tweeted a picture this week showing him smiling and . sitting in a wooden bath, possibly in a sauna, captioned 'Good morning . Earth people'. Another shows him riding a bike. A reliable source independent of . Lebedev has told Mail Online that he is in Israel as Lebedev's lawyers . argued that his rights were flouted if he could not challenge his . accuser in court. Lebedev told the judge yesterday: 'I can provide information on where Polonsky is in several days, your honour.' Excuse: Mr Polonsky is said to be unable to attend the trial as he is stuck in Cambodia . Viral: Footage of the punch, when Polonsky fell backwards and was knocked off his chair, went viral . Despite this, the claim by Polonsky to have been hit three times by Lebedev may be significant in convicting him. Analysts fear a behind the scene . campaign by the Kremlin for his foes to lock him up after his Russian . newspaper Novaya Gazeta carried a series of anti-corruption campaigns. Under Russian law, three - as . distinct from two - punches could be a key factor in permitting the . judge to hand down a long sentence. 'Because of the sudden Lebedev attack . and strong punches I sustained, I fell off with a chair behind the . podium,' said Polonsky in written testimony soon after the event. 'Fortunately, thanks to my physical shape and paratrooper training, I managed to avoid major injury.' He could easily have hit his head on . metal objects in the studio, and but for his training he could have . suffered 'life and health threatening injuries'. 'Lebedev's punches were purposefully . to a sensitive part of the head, the temples, and these  punches could . have had unpredictable consequences, taking into consideration my . dangerous fall with my head down,' he added. Screen . clash: Russian banker and media magnate Alexander Lebedev (pictured) argues that the incident involving Sergei Polonsky was not politically motivated . Experienced: Mr Polonsky claims he did not suffer serious injury 'thanks to my physical shape and training' In the event, Polonsky was knocked off his chair, and suffered some bruises and torn trousers but was relatively unscathed. While Polonsky's statement accuses . Lebedev of 'hooliganism' he does not appear to claim any political . motivation in the attack, yet this is specifically what the Russian . state alleges that he committed. He did, however, call him 'an MP who . resorted to hooliganism'. Lebedev is no longer a national politician but . is a deputy in a regional parliament in Russia. Polonsky quoted Lebedev after the incident saying he had 'neutralised' him. Polonsky said he did not hit back.'I did not succumb to provocations, and didn't cross the line.' Genri Reznik, Lebedev's lawyer, criticised the failure to insist on Polonsky appearing at the trial. This amounted to 'depriving Mr Lebedev from the right to properly protect himself.' The trial resumes on Friday when the media tycoon is expected to call his witnesses.

"Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. In Spain, AS leads with the news that Real Madrid are set to announce the signing of goalkeeper Keylor Navas. The 27-year-old shone for Costa Rica at the World Cup as the surprise package of the tournament reached the quarter-finals in Brazil. Team to beat: Real Madrid are set to sign Keylor Navas (left) and look stronger than last season . AS reports that the transfer from La Liga outfit Levante has been agreed and that Navas could be presented as Carlo Ancelotti's latest signing on Thursday. Navas' signing means the Bernabeu club will have three goalkeepers  - but that may change with Iker Casillas and Diego Lopez both linked with moves away from the Spanish capital. Fellow Madrid-based publication Marca leads with an interview from Real midfielder Luka Modric. The Croatian believes the 10-time European champions are even better than last season following the additions of James Rodriguez and World Cup winner Toni Kroos. Dream deal: Jeremy Mathieu (left) says he's joined the 'best club in the world' following his Barcelona move . Following the death of Real legend Alfredo di Stefano earlier this month, the 28-year-old added that 'there is no better way to honour Di Stefano than maintain his winning philosophy' next season. Elsewhere Mundo Deportivo focuses on the £15.8million signing of Jeremy Mathieu to Barcelona from Valencia. The defender, who hailed the Nou Camp outfit as the 'best in the world' is the fifth purchase of new boss Luis Enrique's reign. The 30-year-old will meet his new team-mates on Friday, Mundo adds, as the Catalan outfit continue their pre-season preparations. Over in Italy, the inquest in their disappointing World Cup campaign continues as candidate for FIGC President Demetrio Albertini has run through his plans to change the face of Italian football. The Azzurri are reassessing their football philosophies after they exited at the group stage of the World Cup for a second successive tournament with one of the former AC Milan's proposals being a reform of the the leagues. Elsewhere Tuttosport and Corriere dello Sport focus heavily on the transfer rumours that are sweeping through Italy's top flight.

The Cagliari centre-back had been in advanced with their bitter rivals Lazio about a move to the Stadio Olmpico but instead signed a new contract at his present club. However, in a shock twist Sky Sport Italia claim the contract extension is just so that Roma can take Astori on loan for £1.6million with an option to buy at the end of the season for a further £4.7million.","Real Madrid are set to sign Levante goalkeeper Keylor Navas .

"As revealed by Sportsmail's Matt Lawton, Malky Mackay and Iain Moody have been reported to the FA and accused of being racist, sexist and homophobic in a shocking series of text messages dating back to their time together at Cardiff City. Here, we take a look at the three main players in the saga. IAIN MOODY . As a graduate in French and Italian, Moody initially found work as a translator for the Italy side during Euro 96, before taking a staff writer’s position at Football365.com. In 2001, he made the move to Athole Still International, a London-based sports management franchise, then leaving to become Watford’s press officer four years later. Shock: Iain Moody, Crystal Palace's director of football (left), and Malky Mackay (right) are being investigated . It was at Vicarage Road that Moody first linked up with Malky Mackay, forming a close professional relationship that saw him soon promoted to football operations manager. When Mackay left for Cardiff in 2011, Moody followed, this time as head of recruitment. Cardiff reached the League Cup final in 2012 and were promoted to the Premier League a year later, but amid a protracted bust-up between Mackay and the club’s controversial owner, Vincent Tan, Moody was dismissed in October 2013. Resigned: Moody (centre with chairman Steve Parish right) was Crystal Palace's sporting director . He was replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov, who was at the club on work experience and a friend of Tan’s son. Crystal Palace were quick to appoint Moody as their sporting director, with a remit to improve their club infrastructure and to address weaknesses in player recruitment. MALKY MACKAY . A powerful centre-back with Queen’s Park, Celtic, Norwich, West Ham and Watford — winning five Scotland caps — he began his managerial career at Championship club Watford in 2009, after Brendan Rodgers resigned. He spent two years at Vicarage Road, safeguarding them from relegation, before moving to Cardiff in 2011. In his first season in charge of the Welsh club, Mackay, 42, guided them to their first ever League Cup final, which they lost to Liverpool on penalties and finished sixth in the Championship, though they missed out on promotion through the play-offs. Reported: Malky Mackay is being investigated by The FA due to racist, sexist and homophobic text messages . Still, 2012’s heartache proved to be short-lived, as Cardiff were promoted to the Premier League as champions the following year. Despite his successes, however, Mackay’s relationship with club owner Vincent Tan became increasingly strained. The Malaysian businessman was reportedly dissatisfied with Mackay’s transfer dealings. Mackay was dismissed as Cardiff manager in December 2013. VINCENT TAN . The bank clerk who became an insurance salesman. The insurance salesman who bought a McDonald’s chain. The McDonald’s store owner who built an empire. The story of Vincent Tan, 62, is fittingly colourful. He bought a McDonald’s franchise in 1980, using the money from rapid expansion to purchase Sports Toto in 1985, a gambling company. Unprecedented success on both fronts allowed him to venture into several more industries, most notably founding the Berjaya Group, which runs the gamut over Malaysian property development and holidays. In addition, he owns two football clubs, Cardiff City, relegated last season, and FK Sarajevo in Bosnia. Better times: Cardiff owner Vincent Tan (left) with his then manager Mackay . The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC. In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete. The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise. Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC. Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter. Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others. Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.

"A New York personal trainer pleaded guilty on Thursday to being part of a New Jersey ring that used violence to coerce Jewish husbands to agree to grant their wives religious divorces, federal prosecutors said on Thursday. David Hellman, 31, was one of 10 men, including two Orthodox Jewish rabbis, arrested last fall in the alleged scheme in which they hired themselves out to unhappy wives who wanted their husbands kidnapped and beaten until they agreed to divorce, the prosecutors in New Jersey said. Hellman was charged with 'traveling in interstate commerce to commit extortion,' and the others were charged with kidnapping, according to government documents. Ariel Potash's attorney Jacob Laufer (pictured) answered questions about one of the accused as he left the federal court in New Jersey in October . Orthodox Jewish women cannot get divorces unless their husbands consent through a document known as a 'get,'and wives paid tens of thousands of dollars to the ring that would abduct and beat their husbands, prosecutors said at the time of the arrests in October. Hellman was part of a group that on Oct. 9, with Jay Goldstein, 59, Moshe Goldstein, 31, Avrohom Goldstein, 34, Simcha Bulmash, 30, Ariel Potash, 40, Binyamin Stimler, 38, and Sholom Shuchat, 29, traveled from New York to a warehouse in Edison to force a Jewish man to allow his wife a 'get', . One of the men at the warehouse was an . undercover FBI agent posing as the victim's brother -in-law who arrested . the men. Hellman admitted to helping to plot the abduction.reports APP.com. FBI agents remove evidence from the Brooklyn residence of Rabbi Mendel Epstein during an investigation, early on Thursday . During his guilty proceeding, Hellman also admitted also to going to a man's residence on August 22, 2011 in order to injure and restrain him until he issued his wife the 'get.' His conduct on April 22 will be considered during his June 12 sentencing. Hellman, of Brooklyn, New York could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 at his June 12 sentencing. The other nine defendants still face criminal charges. The racket was uncovered in a sting operation in which a pair of FBI agents posing as an Orthodox Jewish wife and her brother were to pay $10,000 up front and another $50,000 for men who would beat her husband, prosecutors said. 'Hellman admitted that they discussed a plan and prepared to confine, restrain and threaten the victim,' the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark, New Jersey, said in a statement. Hellman's defense attorney, Michael Bachner, said his client 'has acknowledged his responsibility for his conduct and he is regretful for it, and looks forward to going on with his life.' Experts say such schemes are in response to so-called 'get abuse,' in which husbands demand a larger share of the couple's communal property before granting the divorce. While a 'get' is not required for a civil divorce, that proceeding would not be recognized by Orthodox leaders and the couple would remain married under Jewish law.

"Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata has revealed he is on the verge of a move to Juventus. The forward is set to undergo a medical with the Serie A champions by the end of the week before signing a four-year contract, with the move believed to be worth around 22million euros (£17.5m). Morata, behind Karim Benzema, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Jese in the pecking order in Madrid's attack, was the subject of interest from Arsenal and Wolfsburg but revealed that Juventus have won the battle for his signature.

'I haven't had the chance to speak to Fernando, but it's always good to have someone you know in the dressing room when you get to a new club,' said Morata. As with Dani Carvajal, who Madrid sold to Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 before repurchasing him a year later, a buy-back clause has been inserted into the contract, giving the Spaniards the option to take the forward back to Madrid at the end of next season for 30million euros (£23.8m). Morata, the top scorer at the European Under-21 Championship in 2013, first broke into the Madrid first team in Jose Mourinho's final year in charge but failed to cement his place in the team under Carlo Ancelotti, playing a total of just 558 minutes in the league last season.

"A spelling mistake in the words 'not recommended' on the Obamacare website led to the site going down, it was revealed today in internal notes from 'war . room' meetings of experts scrabbling to breathe life into the shambolic operation. The error limited the choices Obamacare shoppers were offered in October and often presented them with overpriced options. Ultimately, at least some of the website's many outages were brought about by this simple typo, as technicians struggled to give the public an experience that mirrored President Obama's promises. 'In states where the federal government helps run these marketplaces, the average American will have more than 50 different plans to choose from, with different levels of coverage,' the president claimed during a September 26 speech in Largo, Maryland. 'And because insurance companies are competing against one another for your business, a lot of Americans will pay significantly less for their insurance than they do now.' In large measure, that didn't happen. And a tech team met at least once per day in October to sort out this and hundreds of . other technical problems with the ill-fated roll out. One of the reasons the Obamacare website ground to a halt so often in October was a typo in the system that determined whether states had certified insurance companies to participate in the federal health care exchange . As a result of the spelling error, so few insurance plans were green-lighted that insurance shoppers started seeing ' fewer options than would be desired to promote consumer choice' In a section of the group's October 28 notes titled 'Certification suppression updates,' a meeting secretary recorded that '[p]erhaps due to a misspelling in ""not recommended,"" there are errors in the certification suppression data.' It's not clear how the phrase was mangled, but 'recommended' is commonly misspelled with an extra letter 'c.' '[T]his misspelling was not recognized in the system,' the notes continue, 'and it is not updating accurately as a result.' Certification and suppression refer to the thumbs-up and thumbs-down rulings made on each health insurance plan carried on the Obamacare website. The decisions are based on insurance companies' ability to show that their home states have approved their participation in the federal government-run marketplace. But  when the eligible plans began to show up on the website in October, their numbers were suspiciously few in many of the 36 states covered by the exchange. As a result, the meeting notes show, 'in some cases, there will be fewer options than would be desired to promote consumer choice and an ideal shopping experience.' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servics chief Marilyn Tavenner supervised the Obamacare website's creation, which led to late-night comedy jokes and left a flood of politicians from both sides of the aisle scrambling . 'Additionally, in some cases there will be relatively high-cost plans' since the low number of options limited competition. The meeting notes were released this week by the Republican-controlled House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, whose chair Rep. Darrell Issa of California has been critical of the Affordable Care Act and its reliably problematic launch. An official with one of the private contractors tasked with delivering healthcare.gov to the federal government confirmed to MailOnline that the Obamacare website's policy certification and suppression system was 'down more than it was up for the first two weeks of October.' 'It was a huge problem,' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly about his company's work. Another promise ignored? The president claimed in September that 'the average American will have more than 50 different plans to choose from' -- but a typo limited that number severely . Hot seat: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified before a Senate panel on Wednesday but didn't face questions about innocuous-looking typos . The Obamacare team has had problems from the beginning navigating the tricky task of deciding which health care plans qualify for inclusion in among those offered on healthcare.gov. On October 8, one week after the site's premiere, the war room meeting notes show that a project manager requested 'a schedule to suppress/un-suppress' insurance policies at least once per week. A decision was made that day, while millions of Americans were already trying – with little success – to use the website, to submit each Friday a 'weekly suppression list' of plans that should not have been included, with computer experts culling them over the weekend. 'How many changes are we approving? Hundreds,' according to the meeting notes. Those changes also included tweaks to the insurance policies, including one Oklahoma plan whose issuer decided late in the game that it wouldn't cover weight-loss surgery, since its competitors had already decided not to. In another case, the website was offering a dental provider's plans even though they were supposed to be 'suppressed' from public view. '[W]e cannot independently confirm if they are suppressed or not,' the war room heard, 'and we do not know if the problem is wide-spread.' By October 15, the team discovered another massive fly in the ointment. MailOnline went to healthcare.gov on Wednesday to see available plans in states covered by the federal exchange, but waited more than 10 minutes after trying to create an account ... ... and ultimately the website was unable -- three times -- to register a new user . Discussing the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) that insurers must use to submit their plans through the government's Health Insurance Oversight System (HIOS), they learned that the weekly updates of 'certified' plans would wipe out the entire database and force them to start from scratch. 'This resubmission (HIOS and SERFF) will wipe out all certification/suppression statuses in the universe,' the notes show they determined, 'so we will need to get OIS a file with new statuses for everyone, yes?' 'Yes, if an issuer resubmits a template with just one plan change, it changes all the plans for the issuer, so it is good practice to have a full file.' On the following day, according to the meeting notes, the team heard that they now had 'a good process for determining if an issuer should be suppressed/unsuppressed, but it won't be ready by noon tomorrow.' Many of the plans that were hung up behind red tape were those that saw steep rate increases, triggering a requirement that their state governments re-evaluate them before the Obamacare system could offer them to the public. 'For a lot of them, they have rate filings with rate increases of 10% or greater,' the group heard on October 21, 'and the state has to put in a rate filing determination and they haven't. That happened for about half.' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille said during a November 1 conference call with reporters that healthcare.gov is budgeted to cost as much as $630 million.","A typo in the phrase 'not recommended' hamstrung the Obamacare website's system for determining which insurance plans were fit to offer .

"Water inside the Moon’s mantle came from primitive meteorites - the same source thought to have supplied most of the water on Earth, according to new research. The findings, from an analysis of lunar rocks brought back by US astronauts, raise new questions about the process that formed the Moon. The Moon is thought to have formed from a disc of debris left when a giant object hit the Earth 4.5 billion years ago, very early in Earth’s history. Imported water: Scientists believe water found on the Moon is the same as here on Earth . The latest results come from studies samples returned from the moon, including green-tinged stone collected by Apollo 15 in 1971, and orange material gathered by Apollo 17 in 1972. The surprise discovery of the green rock, by Commander Dave Scott and lunar module pilot Jim Irwin, sparked a lengthy debate among the astronauts about the boulder's true colour while Nasa controllers listened in. Scientists have long assumed that the heat from an impact of that size would cause hydrogen and other volatile elements to boil off into space, meaning the Moon must have started off completely dry. But recently, NASA spacecraft and new research on samples from the Apollo missions have shown that the Moon actually has water, both on its surface and beneath. By showing that water on the Moon and on Earth came from the same source, this new study offers yet more evidence that the Moon’s water has been there all along. 'The simplest explanation for what we found is that there was water on the proto-Earth at the time of the giant impact,' said Alberto Saal, associate professor of Geological Sciences at Brown University and the study’s lead author. 'Some of that water survived the impact, and that’s what we see in the Moon.' To find the origin of the Moon’s water, Saal and his colleagues looked at melt inclusions found in samples brought back from the Apollo missions. Debate still rages over exactly how the moon was formed. According to the leading theory, the moon was formed about 4.5bn years ago, from a hot cloud of debris that was knocked into space when a planet the size of Mars slammed into Earth. Astronomers have carried out numerous simulations of the impact event, and many believe it to be the most likely explanation. The latest findings suggest the Earth was already damp at the time the moon was created. 'The simplest explanation for what we . found is that there was water on the proto-Earth at the time of the . giant impact,' said Alberto Saal, associate professor of Geological . Sciences at Brown University and the study’s lead author. 'Some of that water survived the impact, and that’s what we see in the Moon. Melt inclusions are tiny dots of volcanic glass trapped within crystals called olivine. The crystals prevent water escaping during an eruption and enable researchers to get an idea of what the inside of the Moon is like. Research from 2011 found that the melt inclusions have plenty of water — as much water in fact as lavas forming on the Earth’s ocean floor. This study aimed to find the origin of that water. Comets, like meteorites, are known to carry water and other volatiles, but most comets formed in the far reaches of the solar system in a formation called the Oort Cloud. Because they formed so far from the sun, they tend to have high deuterium/hydrogen ratios — much higher ratios than in the Moon’s interior, where the samples in this study came from. Backscatter electron image of a lunar melt inclusion from an Apollo 17 sample . 'The measurements themselves were very difficult,' Hauri said, 'but the new data provide the best evidence yet that the carbon-bearing chondrites were a common source for the volatiles in the Earth and Moon, and perhaps the entire inner solar system.' Recent research, Saal said, has found that as much as 98 percent of the water on Earth also comes from primitive meteorites, suggesting a common source for water on Earth and water on Moon. The easiest way to explain that, Saal says, is that the water was already present on the early Earth and was transferred to the Moon. The finding is not necessarily inconsistent with the idea that the Moon was formed by a giant impact with the early Earth, but presents a problem. If the Moon is made from material that came from the Earth, it makes sense that the water in both would share a common source. However, the team say there is still the question of how that water was able to survive such a violent collision. 'The impact somehow didn’t cause all the water to be lost,' Saal said. 'But we don’t know what that process would be.' It suggests, the researchers say, that there are some important processes we don’t yet understand about how planets and satellites are formed.","Lunar rocks brought home by US astronauts contain droplets of water chemically identical to those on Earth .
Research may change our understanding of the Moon's formation ."
"Workers have been accused of wasting money after choosing to widen a footpath rather than cut back an overgrown hedge so people could get past. The path, which links a main road to pensioner bungalows in Bradford, West Yorkshire, had become blocked due to a hedge running alongside it becoming overgrown. But it is claimed that workmen decided to widen the path so more people had space to pass the rampant overgrown hedge, rather than just prune back its leaves and branches. Scroll down for video . Leslie Howard, next to the path extension laid by workers, rather than them pruning back the nearby overgrown hedge . Leslie Howard, who lives nearby and uses the path often said he was shocked to see workers lay down the tarmac instead of cutting the hedge. The 74-year-old said: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw that instead of cutting the bush back they'd put more tarmac down. 'It's a complete waste of money. I reckon I could have cut the hedge back in half an hour. 'How long does it take to dig out the grass, put hard core down and lay a path?' Mr Howard also added that the new tarmac extension did not even solve the problem because workmen had only dealt with part of the path. Mr Howard, left, said: 'It's a complete waste of money. I reckon I could have cut the hedge back in half an hour . He explained: 'They should come back and cut the hedge back all the way up the path or remove it.' Mr Howard keeps fit by walking to nearby Eastburn, using the path, which runs up a hill towards four bungalows for the elderly. Several years ago Bradford Council replaced the steps on the incline with a ramp to provide wheelchair access to the bungalows. He said he had first reported the overgrown hedge a few years ago and that time workmen had cut it back. However, a spokesman for the council said they weren't responsible for the new path, adding it was nothing to do with them . He added: 'The path was very wide, but this bush started growing and growing until it went over most of the path. 'You have to walk on the grass verge to get round. I'm fairly fit but I have to step on the grass. 'I've seen kids on their bikes come straight down from the path to the grass then back to the path, which is dangerous if they slip.'

"Samsung Galaxy S4 buyers are getting much less storage than they pay for because the device is sold full of 'bloatware'. Bloatware includes apps and files that are added to handsets by the manufacturers and networks before they are sold to customers. The S4, which costs around £550 SIM-free, is advertised as having 16GB of internal storage, yet because or these preinstalled apps, operating system files and network features, this is almost halved to 8.8GB. The Galaxy S4 was launched in March and has already sold 10 million handsets, according to figures from Samsung. The S4 Mini is a compact version of the S4 with many of the same software features. Its hardware features are more like the Samsung Galaxy S3 . Bloatware is the name for any unwanted software or apps that are preinstalled onto phones, tablets, or computers. As well as taking up space that can be used for photos and other personal files, bloatware can also slow down your device. Bloatware can also refer to extras that come with wanted software including browser toolbars, desktop widgets or other unwanted additions. Some of the preinstalled Samsung files are needed for its new features, such as eye tracking, air gestures and voice commands. Others, however, are unnecessary or unwanted utility apps, games and the S Travel and S Health hubs. To add insult to injury, many of these apps and hubs can't be removed. It is common practice for phones and tablets to go on sale without the full amount of storage advertised because a certain amount is always taken up by the essential operating system files. Yet this usually leaves around 70% to 80% of storage left, as is the case with the Google Nexus 7, for example. HTC and Motorola handsets traditionally have 60% of space left after bloatware and system files are taken into account. Some of the preinstalled Samsung files on the S4, pictured, are needed for features such as eye tracking, air gestures and voice commands. Others, however, are unnecessary or unwanted utility apps, games and the S Travel and S Health hubs. Many of which can't be removed . But the worst offenders are Samsung's Activ 8 tablet that is advertised with 64GB of internal storage, but only has 30GB free. And Microsoft's Windows 8 tablets that offer 64GB, but owners can only use about 23GB. Samsung has responded to the criticisms about the S4's storage capacity. Although, the reply just states what files are taking up the space, and advises people that a solution to the problem is to buy a MicroSD card if they want extra storage. Samsung said: 'For the Galaxy S4 16 GB model, approximately 6.85 GB occupies the system part of internal memory, which is 1 GB bigger than that of the Galaxy S3, in order to provide a high resolution display and more powerful features to our consumers. 'To offer the ultimate mobile experience to our users, Samsung provides a microSD slot on Galaxy S4 for extension of memory.' The Samsung Galaxy S4 went on sale in the UK at the end of April.

"Brendan Rodgers should axe Mario Balotelli for Liverpool's Champions League clash against Real Madrid and play Raheem Sterling up front instead, according to Jamie Carragher.

This, then, would be Sportmail's line-up: (4-2-3-1) Simon Mignolet; Glen Johnson, Dejan Lovren, Martin Skrtel, Alberto Moreno; Steven Gerrard, Joe Allen; Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho, Adam Lallana; Raheem Sterling. The big call would be taking Mario Balotelli out of the starting line-up but he has not shown any glimpse of having blistering pace during his time at Liverpool so far. He won't hang on the shoulders of Sergio Ramos and company or set the tone like Luis Suarez did. Sterling, meanwhile, has often given the impression that he could be a devastating striker. Playing him in that role would also give Rodgers the option of dropping him back to help shore up the midfield if Real began to dominate possession. Captain Steven Gerrard will anchor Liverpool's midfield but the Reds must play with plenty of energy . Sterling (left) will bring more pace to Liverpool's attack than the out-of-form Balotelli . Liverpool have won all three previous meetings with Real Madrid. Liverpool 4-0 Real Madrid (March 10, 2009, Champions League) Real Madrid 0-1 Liverpool (February 25, 2009, Champions League) Liverpool 1-0 Real Madrid (May 27, 1981, European Cup final) Midfield will be the crucial area, as if Toni Kroos and Luka Modric get on the ball, they will begin supplying the ammunition to James Rodriguez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. By packing the engine room, with runners and workers, Liverpool have a better chance of disrupting Real. Liverpool are never better than when they when push their opponents back and press them high up the pitch. Henderson, Gerrard, Coutinho, Allen and Lallana are all capable of executing that game plan but those five also give Rodgers flexibility, allowing him to switch formations when necessary. Liverpool will need to stop Cristiano Ronaldo continuing his incredible run of form in front of goal . Gareth Bale (left) will miss the game through injury but Toni Kroos has the potential to be a key player . Luka Modric, in action for Real against Levante, will attempt to pull the strings in Real Madrid's midfield . More than anything, though, Liverpool need to do the basics right. It might seem an obvious thing to say but they have been vulnerable this season to balls lofted into the area – think of the goals they gifted to West Ham and Queens Park Rangers. Should Liverpool be as generous to Madrid as they have been to others so far, their Champions League ambitions will be in grave danger. It is why Rodgers must find the perfect formula to keep the reigning champions at bay. VIDEO Real ready for tough week - Ancelotti .","Brendan Rodgers' side host Real Madrid at Anfield on Wednesday .

"Controversial: Father Piero Corsi posted the bulletin 'Women and femicide - healthy self-criticism. How often do they provoke?' on the church door . An Italian priest has provoked outrage after claiming that women are to blame for domestic violence by wearing tight clothing in his Christmas bulletin - and pinning the notice to the door his church. Father Piero Corsi also attacked women for not cleaning their houses and serving fast food, and called on women to engage in 'healthy self criticism' over femicide - men murdering women. In an astonishing message, he attacked pornography but said women shared the blame for 'provoking . the worst instincts which then turn into violence and sexual abuse'. Father Corsi's letter, pinned to the door of the church in the northern village of San Terenzo di Lerici, said: 'Let's ask ourselves. Is it possible that men have all gone mad at one stroke? We don't think so. 'The core of the problem is in the fact that women are more and more provocative, they yield to arrogance, they believe they can do everything themselves and they end up exacerbating tensions,' it said. 'How often do we see girls and even mature women walking on the streets in provocative and tight clothing? 'Babies left to themselves, dirty houses, cold meals and fast food at home, soiled clothes. 'So if a family ends up in a mess and turns into crime (a form of violence which should be condemned and punished firmly) often the responsibility is shared,' it said. The mayor of Lerici, Marco Caluri, said the article was 'astonishing and deeply offensive'. Scroll down for video . Shocked: Father Piero Corsi said that the backlash from his posting the letter far exceeded his expectations . In his message (pictured), Father Piero Corsi attacked women for not cleaning their houses and called on them to engage in 'healthy self criticism' The bishop of La Spezia ordered it to . be taken down, saying it contained 'unacceptable opinions which are . against the common position of the church'. A . UN report found that one third of women in Italy had reported being a . victim of serious domestic violence and in 2010 127 women were murdered . by men. They were often as a result of 'honour, men's unemployment and jealousy by the perpetrator.' Amid . protests from women’s rights and anti-violence campaigners, Father . Corsi was widely reported by Italian media to have apologised to his . congregation and handed in his resignation. However, he later denied the reports, saying a resignation letter sent to news agencies was 'probably a fake', according to The Journal. He was quoted as saying he will 'take a rest' but had no intention of stepping down. Anger: After Father Piero posted the letter on the door of San Terenzo church (pictured), the bishop of La Spezia ordered that it be taken down . Father Piero Corsi added in his letter posted on the church's door (pictured) that women are 'provocative' and that they 'end up exacerbating tenstions' Accusation: Father Piero Corsi later accused a journalist of being gay for refusing to talk about naked pictures of women . He also asked a reporter for Rai Radio: 'I don’t know whether you’re a queer or not, but what do you feel when you see a naked women? 'Are women themselves not causing harm by unveiling themselves like this?', he was quoted as saying in The Journal. Maria Gabriella Carnieri Moscatelli, the head of Telefono Rosa, an association that helps the victims of violence, said an was not sufficient. She told SkyTG24 television: 'I thank the bishop who had the paper taken down but I'm still not satisfied because I think someone needs to talk to this person and understand why he has these attitudes. 'I think he needs to make a deeper examination of his conscience that goes beyond apologies.' Following protests he told weekly newspaper Oggi: 'After everything that's happened, which has certainly been well beyond what I intended or expected, I think there's need for calm, rest and silence to respond with the serenity and harmony required to carry on.'

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has warned his injured and suspended players they face a fight to automatically win their place back. United beat Everton 2-1 before the international break without 10 players including Michael Carrick, Phil Jones and Wayne Rooney. Some of them are available to return against West Brom on Monday night, though Rooney is still serving a three-match ban, but van Gaal is offering no guarantees. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: The last 30 minutes of our games are the issue . Louis van Gaal says Manchester United's injured stars aren't guaranteed to win their places back . Wayne Rooney (left, next to Ashley Young) was missing for United before the international break . 'Nobody is walking back in my team, believe me,' said the Dutchman. 'You have to earn it on the training ground and every player knows that. 'I have always said it's not automatically players with the biggest names who are the best. I am looking for a consistent level.' Van Gaal may be forced to make some changes with youngster Paddy McNair and Antonio Valencia receiving fresh knocks. On the positive side defenders Chris Smalling and Jones have been training again with midfielders Ashley Young, Michael Carrick and Ander Herrera. Van Gaal said: 'I've got great respect and confidence in the players I have used this season. Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Phil Jones are great football players but we have other great players too, believe me sometimes the other players are doing better. Phil Jones and Michael Carrick are both back in contention for Van Gaal's side away at West Brom on Monday . Youngster Paddy McNair has impressed at the heart of United's defence in the absence of others . 'McNair was outstanding in his first match and you saw the reaction of the fans, they applauded every time he touched the ball. 'He was fantastic in the games he played when Jones, Evans and Smalling were not available. Everyone has to earn their position.' Van Gaal's words will be a comfort to youngsters Tyler Blackett and Luke Shaw who have played recently due to injuries. Despite United being linked with centre-halves in the January transfer window with Aston Villa's Dutchman Ron Vlaar available at £12million, Van Gaal has played down the need for new blood, saying that when players return from the treatment table he will have the optimum 26 players he likes to train with.","Wayne Rooney has been suspended for Manchester United .

With injuries decimating the Arsenal squad, Arsene Wenger has a few selection headaches, particularly in defence, ahead of this match with Anderlecht as the Gunners look to build on their 4-1 win over Galatasary. Starting in goal is expected to be the very inexperienced Emiliano Martinez. The 22-year-old comes into the team after the suspension to No 1 Wojciech Szczesny - sent off against the Turks - while David Ospina is out with a thigh injury. Calum Chambers returns from his own suspension and could replace either Hector Bellerin at right back or Nacho Monreal at centre back. Laurent Koskielny is still suffering with an achillles problem. Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey should both take their place in the Gunners midfield, but Theo Walcott is unlikely to feature as he continues his return from long-term injury. Lukas Podolski has recovered from illness. Anderlecht, meanwhile, are missing defender Fabrice N'Sakala. Jack Wilshere (centre) looks to have shaken off an injury, while Calum Chambers (r) returns from suspension . Theo Walcott (left) is unlikely to feature as he builds up his fitness, but Lukas Podolski (right) is well again . Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Anderlecht and Arsenal have faced each off only twice in European competition – that was in the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1969-70. These two matches ended with one win for each team, but Arsenal lifted the trophy, by winning 4-3 on aggregate. There have been 12 previous meetings between Arsenal and Belgian sides: the Gunners have lost only three times (W7 D2). The Gunners have won each of their last five against teams from Belgium.

Arsenal have found the net only once in their last four away games in European competition, including qualifying. Anderlecht’s last win in Europe came November 2012 (1-0 against Zenit St. Petersburg), with seven losses and three draws since. The Belgians have conceded in each of these 10 matches, 2.6 per game on average.

"Stefan Johansen insists there is no chance of Ronny Deila being broken by the strain of trying to lead Celtic to success in his first season as manager. Deila’s side will try and take another step towards the knockout stage of the Europa League when they face Romanian outfit Astra Giurgiu at Parkhead on Thursday. Progress in that competition would help make up for a double Champions League exit earlier in a season that has also seen Celtic toil for consistent Premiership form. Ronny Deila (right) has been backed by his midfielder, and fellow countryman, Stefan Johansen (centre) Deila (right) watches on as his players train ahead of their Europa League tie against Astra Giurgiu . Saturday’s 5-0 rout of Ross County was a convincing response to a shock 1-0 home defeat from Hamilton, leaving Johansen hopeful that Deila’s reign is now ready for lift-off. The two Norwegians previously worked together in their homeland, but Johansen believes his manager is growing in stature to meet the huge demands at Celtic which have troubled some of his predecessors. ‘He’s strong mentally and he believes in what he does,’ said Johansen. ‘I didn’t see that side of him at Stromsgodset because there wasn’t that pressure. ‘But now, when he has that pressure, he has handled it well. He hasn’t shown any weak points. ‘He hasn’t changed, he believes in the football he wants to play and I’m starting to see that get better. ‘Could the pressure and criticism break Ronny? No, I don’t think so. Johansen (left) and Deila (right) were previously together in Norway . Johansen (left) believes that Deila is mentally strong and will succeed at Celtic . ‘As I said, he is strong mentally. He believes in what he does and, if he doesn’t succeed with that, he can be proud of trying. ‘But I’m sure he’s going to succeed, so that’s not going to happen.’ Asked if he felt Deila could have the same success in the role as Neil Lennon, Johansen added: ‘I think so — and Celtic know that, otherwise he wouldn’t be here.’ ‘We lost against Hamilton and everyone was saying things were so bad but we’re still in both of the domestic cups. ‘We are doing well in the Europa League and hopefully we can win the next two games in the group and basically get through. ‘We want to win the league, so we need to keep picking up three points. We’re still in everything and aiming to get the best results.’ Meanwhile, Celtic winger James Forrest could be in line for a comeback tomorrow night. The Scotland international has been out of action since injuring his hamstring in a substitute appearance against Dundee United in August. Forrest had made only one previous start under new manager Deila as his fitness jinx continued. It is understood, however, that the 23-year-old has been progressing well in training recently. Deila remains keen to ease him back into action carefully but he could now be considered for a place in the squad against the Romanians.","Celtic have endured a difficult start to the Scottish Premiership season .

"On the evening of August 26, 2013, a group of English cricketers walked on to The Oval pitch and sat together in the gathering twilight. They had won the series and retained the Ashes, now they drank champagne in celebration of their triumph. Then something extraordinary happened. A number of players climbed to their feet and, one by one, proceeded to urinate on the wicket, while colleagues cheered in laddish approval. Over in the Press Box, a few Australian cricket writers were putting the last, sombre touches to their Test match reports. They looked up, realised what was happening out in the middle and gleefully began a whole new story. The incident was scarcely earth-shattering, indeed, there were those who excused it as no more than ‘high spirits’. Yet it was undeniably crass and arrogantly disrespectful and, for some, it crystallised lurking misgivings about the England side. They were richly talented, hugely successful but too often they lacked the style, the class, the charm we seek in the best of our sportsmen. As such, they were widely celebrated but sadly unloved. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Pietersen talk about abuse and bullying in the England team . Kevin Pietersen celebrates a double century during an Ashes test against Australia in December 2010 . The South-African born batsman has had many highs and many lows during a headline-making career . Victory usually writes its own cheque with the English public. We can think of any number of unappealing figures who became national treasures simply by beating Australia at cricket. But never has a team of proven winners attracted so many reservations among those who were desperate to celebrate their achievements. Of course, there was a nucleus of quietly impressive individuals. The successive captains, Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook, spring swiftly to mind, as do the likes of Ian Bell and poor Jonathan Trott. But others seemed rather less engaging. There was Graeme Swann, a fine spinner, desperate to be recognised as a ‘character’. Swann, or ‘Swanny’, as he much prefers to be called, deserted Test cricket when England were 3-0 down in an Ashes series in Australia. There was Swann’s chippy chum Matt Prior, whose wearisome barking was a discordant sound of an English summer. And there was Stuart Broad, a notably preening, pouting presence in a team which had its share of preening pouters. Which leads us, quite naturally, to Kevin Pietersen. One imagines that the past few days have been some of the happiest of his life. In recent months, he has been obliged to rely on the efforts of minor showbiz mediocrities to keep his name in the headlines. But now everybody, but everybody, has been talking about him! And all it took was one spectacularly dreadful book. Boorish, vindictive, petulant, insufferably conceited and remorselessly self-justifying, Pietersen’s autobiography is a study in paranoia. Jealousy is everywhere, resentment is rampant, the world is conspiring to do down KP. But will KP be done down? He will not. And all of those enemies and ingrates, from Strauss to Andy Flower, to most of the England bowlers, to all of the cricket media; well, now they know that KP is not a man to cross. Pietersen has spent the week shamelessly self-promoting his dreadful new book . One victim of Pietersen's literary attacks is his former coach Andy Flower (left) His lack of awareness is astonishing. Last week, speaking to the Today programme on Radio Four, he was asked if there was anything he might have done differently. ‘Absolutely’, he said. ‘I think my biggest single flaw is that I’m too honest, too much of a straight talker.’ It was gauche beyond parody. A man with even a shred of self-awareness could not have uttered that line. Yet Pietersen had clearly rehearsed it. In truth, the entire interview was studded with unconscious gems, but the following passage rang a familiar bell: ‘When I did get sacked, a lot of the youngsters who are in the team at the moment sent me messages saying, “I’m really sorry. Thank you so much for all your help”. I get messages when the team are playing against India saying, “How am I going to play this guy? What should I do in this situation?”.’ Then I recalled these words of another wickedly maligned titan: ‘You’ve seen how I react to people, make them feel good, make them think that anything’s possible. And I don’t do it so they turn round and go, “Thank you David for the opportunity, thank you for the wisdom, thank you for the laughs”. I do it so, one day, someone will go, “There goes David Brent. I must remember to thank him”.’ Pietersen had to pack his bags in February, when he was sacked by the ECB . Pietersen takes a snap of the Ashes urn (left), and looks downbeat during an England training session (right) Brent and KP have a good deal in common. Like Pietersen, Brent would have shaken off the dust of counties and nations with scarcely a second thought. Like Pietersen, he would have cast himself as perpetual victim. And, like Pietersen, he would have listened only to courtiers and sycophants while ignoring sane, intelligent men of cricket who were offering more prudent counsel. And yet, we must curse the wanton waste. At a time when England face an impossibly crowded year of international cricket, a great player has placed himself beyond the pale. The bloom of Pietersen’s glittering talent has faded but he surely had more runs to plunder, more service to offer. No longer. He has gone and he will not be back. And how will posterity remember him? I suspect Pietersen will be seen in the same light as the team he once adorned: richly talented, hugely successful and widely celebrated. But sadly unloved.","Kevin Pietersen has spent the week shamelessly self-promoting his dreadful book, which has put his name in all the headlines .

"Scotland head coach Vern Cotter has named Grant Gilchrist as captain of a 33-man squad heading into the autumn internationals. The Edinburgh lock, who twice skippered his country in the summer, will now lead the Scots into battle against Argentina, New Zealand and Tonga next month. Gilchrist is joined in the squad by five of his Edinburgh team-mates hot on the heels of their impressive 15-13 win at Bordeaux-Begles in the Challenge Cup on Friday. Grant Gilchrist (above) has been selected by coach Vern Cotter to lead Scotland in the Autumn internationals . Mark Bennett (above) of Glasgow Warriors is the only uncapped player in  Cotter's 33-man Scotland squad . But it is Glasgow Warriors, who emphatically upset much-fancied Bath 37-10 at the Scotstoun Stadium in the Champions Cup on Saturday, that account for 17 of the players selected. Mark Bennett scored two tries as the Warriors mauled their Aviva Premiership opponents and he is the only uncapped player included. Former Clermont Auvergne coach Cotter began his Scotland reign with three consecutive wins over the United States, Canada and Argentina in June before his side slumped to a heavy 55-6 defeat against South Africa in Port Elizabeth last time out. He will be looking for signs of development this autumn, with a rematch against the Pumas at Murrayfield on November 8, before they face the might of the All Blacks a week later at the same venue and then finish up against Tonga at Rugby Park, Kilmarnock, on November 22. Cotter, who won the Top 14 and was a Heineken Cup runner-up during an eight-year spell with Clermont, will have been boosted by the strong form of both Glasgow and Edinburgh as well as signs that Greig Laidlaw is finding his feet at Gloucester after moving to the English side in the summer. Scotland coach Cotter (above)is expecting three difficult tests in Scotland's autumn fixtures . 'We want to develop, and impose, our style, will, and strategy on our opposition. We want to play well, and enjoy playing in front of our home crowd,' he told the official Scottish Rugby website. 'Argentina will offer us a very stern test, especially at scrum time. They have good variety and move the ball well from nine, through the middle of the paddock and out the back. 'The All Blacks have just won the Rugby Championship and are the best team in the world, so we'll have to be on our toes.' He added: 'Tonga will be the final big test psychologically, having come through two big games, to play away from Murrayfield, and needing to put in a good performance at Rugby Park in Kilmarnock. 'It's essential that we show maturity, mental strength and adaptability throughout the series.'","Edinburgh lock Grant Gilchrist has captained Scotland twice before .

"Australia's urgent quest to appoint a new national coach ahead of their European tour took a major step forward today, as Michael Cheika confirmed that he has been offered the job. The New South Wales Waratahs coach – who was previously in charge at Leinster and Stade Francais – guided his side to the Super 15 title this year and he was linked to the Wallabies role even before Ewen McKenzie’s abrupt resignation on Saturday. Now, rumours that Cheika had already been approached have been reinforced by the news that he is on the verge of being appointed. On Sunday, Bill Pulver, the embattled chief executive of the Australian Rugby Union, claimed that he faced a race to find a coach to front the five-match tour which begins against the Barbarians at Twickenham on November 1. However, it appears that he had in fact made his move during the final stages of McKenzie’s turbulent regime. Australia's late defeat to New Zealand forced coach Ewen McKenzie to resign before European Tour . McKenzie (above) announced his departure at a press conference immediately after the defeat . Michael Cheika (above) is set to take over from McKenzie, and lead Australia for their Autumn tour of Europe . Cheika suggested that he is keen to accept the job, but there are still issues to resolve if he is to be in position by the time the Wallabies fly north on Friday. ‘It’s a pretty humbling experience to be asked to be involved in something like that, but we’ll see what happens,’ he told the Sydney Morning Herald. ‘There are a few things to be ironed out, obviously the logistics etc ... everything is so close. So we will see how it goes and work it out from there.’ Asked if he was excited about the opportunity, he added: ‘Who wouldn't be excited.’ And despite having a year left on his contract with the Waratahs, it seems that the Sydney-based franchise are ready to release him in the national interest. McKenzie resigned shortly after Australia succumbed to an agonising 29-28 defeat against New Zealand in Brisbane – against a backdrop of controversy. Malakai Fekitoa celebrates as his late try hands New Zealand a 29-28 victory over Australia . The New Zealand side perform the Haka before the start of the game against Australia . His position had appeared untenable as the ARU were thought to have begun discreetly sounding out potential replacements for the former Queensland Reds coach, who only took over last summer. He had been under siege after suspending maverick back Kurtley Beale for sending offensive text messages about a female member of the Wallabies’ staff, team business manager Di Patston – who promptly resigned. McKenzie was then forced to deny having a personal relationship with Patston. Bill Pulver, chief executive of the Australian Rugby Union, hastily blamed McKenzie’s departure on a media campaign against him, leading to questions about his own position. ‘Ewen said he was going to struggle to retain the level of support he needs from the playing group, in my view, because of the character assassination he’s suffered in the last two weeks.’ The Wallabies are in turmoil, just weeks before matches against the Barbarians, Wales, France, Ireland and England – and 11 months before a World Cup where they find themselves in a pool of death alongside England and Wales.","Michael Cheika said the opportunity to coach Australia is 'pretty humbling'

"An elderly widower choked on a celebratory Steak dinner in Lake Tahoe Thursday night just hours before having sex for the first time since his beloved wife died over a decade ago. Johnny Orris, 86, was greatly looking forward to collect a prize he'd won on the Howard Stern show for the 'Get My Get my Grandpa Laid' contest in October: a menage a trois with two prostitutes at the famed Bunny Ranch in Nevada. Orris and his grandson Ed, 49, were dining at the Sage Room Steakhouse at Harvey's Lake Tahoe when Orris began choking on his meal, said Bunny ranch owner Dennis Hof to the Daily News. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO: WARNING EXPLICIT LANGUAGE . Johnny Orris (bottom right) and his grandson Ed (top right) appeared on the Howard Stern Show in October . The men appeared on the show for the 'Get My Grandpa Laid' contest shown here on Howard Stern's Website . Ed and the maitre'd performed CPR. Orris was later taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. Prostitutes Caressa Kisses and Vanity were heartbroken upon hearing the news that the gentleman they'd corresponded with almost every day since October choked just moments before they were able to give him the night of his life. 'I'm gonna be back here at 9-o'clock--you'd better be ready!,' Orris told the girls. 'He was on cloud nine, and anxious to get back to the Bunny Ranch,' said his grandson Ed. Back in October, Orris told Howard Stern that his wife died 11 years ago and that he hadn't had sex since. He loved his wife dearly and never strayed. After her death he remained celibate but he dreamed of having sex with 'big breasted black women. ' The Friday following the contest, Ed and his grandfather spent the day flirting with the bunnies and Johnny was able to choose the two he wanted for his 'dream come true.' He chose the blonde and busty Caressa and a curvaceous brunette named Vanity. Howard Stern (pictured here) granted 86-year-old Grandpa Johnny the night of a lifetime . Dennis Hof, owner of the Moonlight Bunny Ranch, mourned the retired farmer's tragic death . Girls outside the Bunny Ranch in Nevada where Grandpa Johhny won a dream night with two girls (not pictured here) Orris flew all the way from Sullivan, Illinois and wanted to have steak 'before the big game,' Hof told TMZ. 'Johnny said he was prepping for the ""Super Bowl of Sex"" and he never got there,' continued Hof. Ed went to the ranch to tell them the sad news after his grandfather choked. Hof and the bunnies let Ed use his grandpa's coupon for a free night of fun. Ed told TMZ that he would have felt bad leaving the ranch without experiencing what it had to offer. He also told TMZ he didn't have sex with Caressa or Vanity 'because that would have been weird.' The Moonlight Bunny ranch is considered 'the finest adult entertainment facility' in Reno according to their website. The ranch was featured in an HBO documentary called, 'Cathouse.' It is one of the few legal brothels in the United States. Nevada is the only state to legalize any form of prostitution.

"Pirelli has opted to alter its tyre choice for the upcoming Brazilian Grand Prix after the original decision was branded as 'dangerous' by Felipe Massa. The Italian tyre manufacturer had initially opted for the medium and hard compounds of rubber for the Interlagos circuit. Williams driver Massa, however, was typically outspoken on the matter as he claimed the choice was 'totally unacceptable'. Felipe Massa described Pirelli's first choice of tyres for his home Grand Prix as 'very dangerous' Although Massa's remarks cut no ice with Pirelli motorsport director Paul Hembery, he recognised the fact recent resurfacing works could have a bearing. After consulting with all 11 teams via F1's Tyre Working Group, Pirelli will now run the soft and medium compounds for the race on November 9. Hembery said: 'We've always said we would be open to any changes if they were required. 'After further technical analysis of the impact of the revised circuit surface, together with a risk assessment suggesting a low probability of compound overheating due to extreme track temperatures, we have made this change with the unanimous agreement of all 11 teams.' The Brazilian Grand Prix on November 9 is hosted at the Interlagos circuit, which has been resurfaced . Paul Hembery, Pirelli motorsport director, said the company were always open to a change of compound .","Pirelli have changed their choice of tyres for the Brazilian Grand Prix .

"South Africa began a week of intense preparation for their tour to Europe but captain Jean de Villiers said on Monday they already had an eye on next year's World Cup. 'We have only eight games left before the World Cup starts which is not a lot for whatever you want to work on,' he told reporters after the first day of a week-long training camp in the spiritual home of Springbok rugby in the Cape Winelands. 'The games coming up give us an opportunity to try combinations and tactics but most important for us will be to pick up where we left off against the All Blacks and against Australia.' South African players train in Stellenbosch ahead of their tour of Europe . Jean de Villiers (L) claims that the Springboks are already thinking ahead to the Rugby World Cup . The Springboks beat both their Antipodean rivals in their last two games of the southern hemisphere's Rugby Championships and De Villiers said the boost in confidence has meant a reinvigorated squad at their training camp. This week South Africa's squad will work on both conditioning and 'getting the details right,' added De Villiers, who recently collected his 100th international cap. 'It's not often we get a chance to prepare both at this stage of the season. 'We have a lot to work, we really need to work on all facets of our play. On attack, we need to work on decision-making, we made some basic errors in our last game against the All Blacks.' The Springboks recorded victories over Australia and New Zealand in their last two games down south . South Africa snatched a dramatic 27-25 win in Johannesburg on Oct. 4 to end New Zealand's 22-match record-winning stretch. They next take on Ireland (Nov. 8), England (Nov. 15), Italy (Nov. 22) and Wales on Nov. 29. 'We set high standard on our last tours to Europe and we want to keep that up,' he added.

"Lance Hohaia has accepted a one-match ban for his forearm strike which sparked the punches from Ben Flower during a brutal opening to Saturday's Super League Grand Final between St Helens and Wigan. The 31-year-old New Zealand stand-off, who caught Flower off the ball, was knocked to the ground by the Wigan prop's first punch and then lay motionless as Flower landed a second on his face.

"St Helens want to let the RFL deal with disgraced Wigan prop Ben Flower after he punched Lance Hohaia in Saturday’s Grand Final and are unlikely to call for a criminal investigation. Flower was sent off for landing two blows on Hohaia, the second while his opponent lay motionless on the ground at Old Trafford. The 26-year-old has been charged with a Grade F offence, the most serious in the RFL’s disciplinary code, and will appear before a three-man panel on Tuesday.

Saints also have the option of pursuing their own action and held talks with Greater Manchester Police on Monday. However, it is understood the Grand Final winners are reluctant to do so if they are satisfied with the RFL punishment. Saints chief executive Mike Rush said: ‘We’ll wait for the league to take the appropriate steps before passing comment and will then consider our position.’ There are concerns within the game that involving the police would set a dangerous precedent. Former Wales dual-code international Jonathan Davies said: ‘It opens up a can of worms if the police get involved because then you could have cases like this in any sport, from any age.’ Hohaia has been charged with a Grade B offence for allegedly striking Flower in the face with his forearm, which carries a ban of one to two games.

"David Strettle urged England to show greater consistency with their wing selections after advancing his own case for a recall with two more tries on Saturday. The 31-year-old demonstrated his finishing class as Saracens claimed a stirring 30-23 victory over Clermont Auvergne in Pool One of the European Champions Cup at Allianz Park. Despite his latest feat, Strettle is unlikely to feature in the England squad named on Wednesday and he expressed concerns about the selection policy out wide. Saracens winger David Strettle crossed for two tries as his side prevailed 30-23 over Clermont . Chris Ashton also registered a brace of tries as he looks to cement a spot in Stuart Lancaster's squad . 'So many wings come and go with England because Test rugby is a bigger game. You have to have more of an all-round game,' he said. 'The sad thing is you get young lads who come in and score tries for their clubs, get put in at the highest level and get exposed then people just get rid of them. 'They've shown some natural talent in being a good finisher, so teach them the game and stick with them. That doesn't seem to happen on the wing. 'If they're scoring tries in the Premiership and not scoring for England — but they go back to the Premiership and keep scoring tries — maybe it's because they're not getting the same ball. Explosive Bath winger Semesa Rokoduguni has been tipped to win his first England cap in November . 'Lads are usually blooded a lot younger on the wing and there needs to be more onus on sticking with them and teaching them a bigger skill base. 'I'm one of the best wings in England and have been playing consistently at this level for a number of seasons. Stuart (Lancaster) has done the right thing. He's had a look at the wings out there and I hope that leading up to the World Cup he'll pick the best ones.' Chris Ashton also scored two tries in Saracens' win and is destined to be included in the England squad, along with Marland Yarde and one or both of the Bath pair, Anthony Watson and Semesa Rokoduguni. Jonny May of Gloucester and Wasps' Christian Wade are also in the mix. In Saturday's other Pool One match, Sale stormed into a 23-7 half-time lead at home to Munster, but the visitors rallied with two tries after half-time and snatched a 27-26 win courtesy of Ian Keatley's injury-time drop goal. Dan Biggar was in superb form for the Ospreys as the Welsh region cruised a 42-7 victory against Treviso . Wales star Dan Biggar wants the Ospreys to travel 'full of confidence' when they tackle English champions Northampton at Franklin's Gardens next Saturday. Fly-half Biggar kicked 17 points and ran the show as Ospreys opened their European Champions Cup campaign in emphatic fashion by posting a 42-7 bonus-point victory over outclassed Treviso at the Liberty Stadium. It meant the unbeaten Guinness PRO12 leaders took early charge of Pool Five, teeing up the Saints clash after clinching a seventh successive win in all competitions. Ospreys centre Josh Matavesi makes a break through the Treviso defence at the Liberty Stadium . Biggar said: 'We realise how difficult a place it is going to be to play at next week, but also we should go up there with confidence. Why not? 'We are unbeaten this season at the minute. We are under no illusions that there is loads to work on, but why not go up there full of confidence and give it a good go?' Northampton lock Courtney Lawes rises high to claim a lineout but his side went down 20-11 in Paris . Northampton endured an agonising end to their Pool Five match against Racing Metro in Paris. With time almost up, Ben Foden had a kick charged down on his 22 by Marc Andreu, who ran on to score. Johannes Goosen added the extras to deny Saints a losing bonus point in a 20-11 victory. Racing Metro scrum-half Maxime Machenaud fires out a pass during his team's victory over the Saints .

"Ben Flower faces a suspension after being sent off for a shocking attack on St Helens stand-off Lance Hohaia during Saturday's Super League Grand Final. The Wigan prop had spilled the ball with a try beckoning in the opening minute and seconds later losty his cool.

The former Crusaders forward then struck his defenceless opponent with a second punch to his face while he laid motionless on the turf. Referee Phil Bentham had no choice but to brandish a red card and Flower became the first player to be sent off in a Grand Final. St Helens went on to win the showpiece 14-6. Flower now faces a suspension of at least eight matches after being charged by the Rugby Football League for his double punch on St Helens' Lance Hohaia in Saturday's Grand Final. Flower has been charged with the Grade F offence of violent and aggressive punching/punching an off-guard opponent. The advisory suspension tariff for a player found guilty of such an offence is eight-plus games as it is the most heinous crime on the RFL's sliding scale.

Manu Tuilagi v Chris Ashton - 2011 . Manu Tuilagi received a five-week ban, missing the Premiership final between Leicester and Saracens, after punching England team-mate Chris Ashton during a match against Northampton. Then just 20, Tulilagi's ban was initially 10 weeks but was reduced to five because there was provocation, a push in the back, from Ashton. Rather than waiting for an awkward meeting at England training, Tuilagi was quick to make amends. 'I rang him up and we went to the cinema and for a meal,' said Tuilagi in an interview with Sportsmail, as if it were any other trip with a mate. 'We had a night out together. We watched Transformers... Romantic.' Manu Tuilagi punches England team-mate Chris Ashton during Leicester's clash with Northampton in 2011 .

Billy Bremner v Kevin Keegan - 1974 . The 1974 Charity shield match between Leeds United and Liverpool was marred by a clash between Billy Bremner and Kevin Keegan who were both duly sent off. Angry having been fouled persistently, Keegan, unaware that Giles was the culprit of the latest challenge, lashed out at Bremner. Scotland international Bremner hit back and referee Bob Matthewson had no choice but to send both players off - the pair famously throwing the shirts to the floor as they trudged off the field.

"Fresh from the most eye-popping Ryder Cup debut since Sergio Garcia got up US noses in 1999, American Patrick Reed is back to add a welcome dollop of spice to the Volvo World Match Play Championship, which begins at the London Golf Club in Kent on Wednesday. At Gleneagles, Reed took on the home crowd with his histrionic fist pumping and exhortations of joy every time he holed a birdie putt. When he got back to America, he was overwhelmed with congratulatory emails. Not surprising given he registered a team-high 3.5 points, but what did take him aback was that most of them came from Europe. Patrick Reed (third left) is jokingly told to be quiet at the tournament's welcome dinner on Tuesday evening . Reed (left) and his caddie Kessler Karain look up their notes during Tuesday's pro-am at the London Golf Club . ‘About five were from Americans and the rest were from the European crowd,’ said the 24-year-old. ‘All of them were positive. It’s the one week where you can go back and forth with the crowds. They clearly loved the fact I gave them something to react to. ‘Am I going to get as rowdy this week? Probably not. But if I am making birdies and playing well, there will be fist pumps and excitement.’ Graeme McDowell, defending champion this week, acknowledged the X factor Reed delivers. ‘All credit to him for coming over because he definitely adds a dynamic,’ he said. ‘He is controversial in a good way, in an Ian Poulter-like way.’ Reed celebrates holing a putt on the final day of the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles last month . Reed has been following the inquest into America’s crushing Ryder Cup defeat. He made it clear he didn’t agree with Phil Mickelson’s analysis that it was all captain Tom Watson’s fault. ‘He was my first captain and I actually enjoyed what he did,’ said Reed. ‘Honestly, for me, if we win or lose it’s not really on what is said or anything like that. ‘I felt like our camaraderie was great. It comes down to us and how we play and unfortunately we didn’t play well enough.’ Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell takes a selfie with his playing partners during the pro-am event . With astute analysis like that, what a shame Reed isn’t part of the task force appointed by the PGA of America on Tuesday to look into why they keep losing. Instead, the four players who have lost the most matches in American Ryder Cup history —Jim Furyk (20), Mickelson (19), Tiger Woods (17), and Raymond Floyd (16) — are all part of the task force, while Paul Azinger, the only winning American Ryder Cup captain this century, is not. It’s beyond parody, isn’t it? As for Reed, he will have to show some of that Gleneagles form if he is to get through a group including doughty Swede Jonas Blixt, in-form Englishman Paul Casey and another whose profile shot skywards following a sterling Ryder Cup debut, Welshman Jamie Donaldson. The players at this year's Volvo World Match Play Championship pose for a photo together on Tuesday . The quartet will play each other over the next three days with the top two progressing to the quarter-finals on Saturday. McDowell will kick off on Wednesday against Frenchman Alexander Levy, who won the rain-curtailed Portugal Masters last week. Joost Luiten and Mikko Ilonen complete this group. Scot Stephen Gallacher will take on Irishman Shane Lowry in a good-looking match in a group that also features Victor Dubuisson and Spaniard Pablo Larrazabal. Henrik Stenson is the standout name in the fourth group which also includes Francesco Molinari, George Coetzee and Thongchai Jaidee. The 16-man field is divided into four groups, with two from each group progressing into Saturday’s quarter-finals after playing one another over the next three days.

"Trainer Brian Ellison insists Top Notch Tonto lines up in Saturday’s Qipco Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in as good a form as when second to OIympic Glory last year. The gelding with distinctive white front legs was a revelation in 2103, a switch to Ellison sparking a rise of over 30lb in his official rating. Top Notch Tonto finished second to Olympic Glory at Ascot last year . He has yet to win in six runs this year but Ellison has been encouraged by his narrow defeat at York’s Ebor meeting and, especially, a close fourth in the Group Two Boomerang Mile at Irish Champions weekend. Crucially, the cause of Dale Swift’s mount has been aided by torrential rain which turned Ascot’s going heavy. Ellison said: ‘The going will be perfect and he is in great form.

"Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski has shot down reports that he is being lined up for a £10million move to bitter rivals Tottenham. The World Cup winner posted a message on his Twitter account, saying: 'Hell would freeze over before this transfer would happen #Poldi #aha #AlwaysAGunner #Nevercheatyourclub #afc #RedArmy'. Reports suggest the Germany forward has grown frustrated at his lack of playing time - with Arsene Wenger yet to start him in the Premier League this season, preferring Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck. Lukas Podolski has swiftly nipped rumours of a move from Arsenal to Tottenham in the bud . The World Cup winner made it clear in no uncertain terms that he wouldn't be leaving for White Hart Lane . The fact the 29-year-old has been unable to force his way in even though Arsenal have also been without long-term absentees Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud has led to uncertainty over his future. Speaking after winning his 120th cap for Germany in the 1-1 draw with the Republic of Ireland, Podolski said: 'I have assessed my position in the team, and it has to change now. 'Let's see what happens in the winter. The fact is that I'm not happy with it, that's clear.' What is also clear is that, should the former Cologne forward decide to leave the club, he will not be moving across north London to White Hart Lane.

"Callum McGregor insists Celtic are ready to win their Europa League group by sinking FC Astra both home and away. The Romanians visit Parkhead on Thursday after losing their opening games to Red Bull Salzburg and Dinamo Zagreb and winning just one of their last eight. That led to the sacking last week of under-fire boss Daniel Isiala, with former Steaua Bucharest coach Oleg Protasov taking over after a nine-year absence from Romanian football, and young midfielder McGregor says Ronny Deila’s side will compound their misery with victories in their back-to-back games. Celtic's Callum McGregor celebrates after scoring his side's second goal of the game against Ross County . Boosted by Saturday’s 5-0 thrashing of Ross County, in which he claimed his fifth Celtic goal of the season, the 21-year-old declared: ‘I feel we can win our Europa League section now. Celtic boss Ronny Deila applauds on the touchline . ‘We have started well with the draw (with Red Bull Salzburg) and the win (over Dinamo Zagreb) and I definitely feel if we can beat Astra on Thursday night we can go on and top the group. In fact, six points from the two matches would be massive and that’s what we’re looking for.’ Former Soviet Union striker Protasov could do nothing to solve Astra’s current crisis on Sunday and said they require ‘immediate surgery’ after his first game was drawn 1-1 with minnows Gaz Metan Medias. McGregor has also vowed to fight his way back into the Scotland squad for next month’s double header with Ireland and England. He earned a shock call-up to Gordon Strachan’s squad for the narrow defeat to world champions Germany in Dortmund. But the experience proved short lived when Ryan Gauld and Stevie May came in for the games with Georgia and Poland instead. McGregor says he has no intention of fading into the international shadows. ‘Of course dropping out of the Scotland squad was disappointing. But when I was picked for the Germany game, I said at the time it had come early in my career and it was a bonus. ‘My main focus is to play well and score goals for Celtic, but if I keep playing well and doing that, there is no reason why I can’t get back into the set-up. ‘It’s not a case of waiting to see what happens, I’m trying to get in.

"Celtic have stepped up the role of sports psychologist Jim McGuinness by asking the Irishman to concentrate his efforts on the Parkhead first team. The 42-year-old quit his successful role as manager of the Donegal GAA team recently to spend more time in Glasgow. And he admits he has hit it off with coach Ronny Deila to such an extent he has stepped up from working with development players to assist the first team. Sports psychologist Jim McGuiness has been asked to concentrate on the Celtic first team by Ronny Deila . A prominent figure on the touchline before Saturday’s 5-0 thrashing of Ross County, McGuinness flew to Dublin after the game and told RTE’s Saturday Night Show: ‘Since the new manager has come in he wants me to work pretty much exclusively now with the first team. I work on the psychology things with players. ‘We are very like-minded in our approach. Other than the fact I was very defensive and he is very offensive, the principles are exactly the same. ‘And that is what he wants, high-octane football, energy, workrate, a lot of preparation and a lot of offensive energy going forward – taking the game to the opposition. ‘That’s the style of play he brought from his previous club and he wants to implement that. ‘If you take that philosophy forward there are a lot of demands within it. The energy levels can sometimes become a problem so the key thing for a manager is that the players are happy and have high energy levels. ‘If you want to train at 100 per cent every day and work hard every day and want high energy on the pitch and in drills then you have to be demanding. That’s why my role has become more important. If it was a situation where he wasn’t demanding that much it would be a bit easier for the players.’ Brought to the club by major shareholder Dermot Desmond under Neil Lennon’s tenure, McGuinness quit Donegal after their All Ireland final loss to Kerry. McGuiness was brought to the club by Dermot Desmond under Neil Lennon's (above) tenure . Admitting his role at Lennoxtown has evolved significantly, he added: ‘When I first went to Celtic initially it was for players who were very close to getting into the first team. Can we bridge that gap and get them over the line and take them into the first-team set-up? ‘From that point we tried to put a lot of systems in place to develop the players. In soccer a lot of it is about opinions, so when I went there based on my own sports science and psychology and coaching background I wanted to try and make it more objective. ‘To try to develop key performance indicators that would give us a reading on players on a consistent basis. That has been rolled out now from the under-nines up to the under-20s.’ McGuiness has also developed links with Europe’s victorious Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley and was spotted at Gleneagles for last month’s win over the United States. McGuiness was spotted at the Ryder Cup last month as he developed links with Paul McGinley . ‘Paul’s father Mick is an ardent Donegal supporter,’ he explained. ‘Mick called me up and said Paul would like to meet me. ‘I wanted to meet him, he wanted to meet me as well. Paul had just managed Ireland in the Seve Trophy and wanted a handle on team dynamics because golf is an individual sport . ‘He had spoken to Martin O’Neill and Alex Ferguson, but was interested in what we had done with Donegal and interested in man management and what we had done with players and building relations and stuff. ‘I went down and met him and there was a match on the TV. It was Christmas time, it started at 8pm and I didn’t leave until three in the morning. Our relationship has really grown very strong. ‘There has been a lot of speculation about what I was doing with the Ryder Cup team. But the reality is that I probably have leant on Paul more than he has leant on me because he has been a very good source of counsel as issues came up.’","Jim McGuinness was working with development squad before .

"Dave King has insisted he was confident about brokering a £16million funding package for Rangers after arriving in Glasgow to hold talks with Ibrox directors. The Castlemilk-based businessman flew from his home in South Africa to London early on Tuesday morning before heading north. His face-to-face meeting with members of the Rangers board, including chairman David Somers and chief executive Graham Wallace, came after 72 hours in which negotiations between the two sides had intensified. Dave King, pictured here in March, was at Ibrox on Tuesday for a two-hour meeting with the Rangers board . Asked if he was optimistic a deal could be agreed as he left Ibrox yesterday evening, King replied: ‘Yes, we are.’ Rangers officials declined to comment. Sportsmail last week revealed details of the King-led plan now being presented to the cash-strapped club, who are on course to run out of funds before the end of the year. He is the key player in an alliance of investors – also featuring former director Paul Murray and shareholder George Letham – who are offering an initial £16m in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue. For that to happen, the group require the board to recommend their plan and include it as a resolution at the AGM, which must take place before the end of December. It would then need the backing of 75 per cent of existing shareholders for the share issue to proceed. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley (right) owns an 8.92 per cent stake in the Ibrox club . The situation is further complicated by Mike Ashley’s ongoing move to oust Wallace and Philip Nash as directors. Both are favourable towards King’s proposal. Newcastle United owner Ashley recently increased his stake in Rangers to 8.9 per cent and has called for an EGM to shake-up the board. The club remain in the process of verifying that request and have yet to confirm any date for the proposed meeting. Losing Wallace and Nash from the board would be a huge blow to the King group but it remains a possibility that they could seek a form of truce with Ashley. The Sports Direct billionaire already has significant commercial interests at Ibrox through his retail contracts and could feasibly call off his EGM move if he was persuaded there is no threat to his financial position at the club.","Dave King was at Ibrox on Tuesday for a meeting with the Rangers board .

"Click here for Grand Final match report by Martha Kelner . Ben Flower apologised for the punch deemed too violent for daytime TV as he attempted to cushion the blow to his own career, Wigan Warriors and the reputation of rugby league. In a display of inexplicable brutality, two minutes into the Grand Final at Old Trafford, Flower knelt over St Helens’ Lance Hohaia — whom he had already knocked unconscious with a swinging punch — and landed a second, shocking blow. ‘There is no defence for my actions,’ said Flower. ‘It was something that happened in the heat of the moment when our emotions and adrenaline were running high. I instantly regretted it and am devastated that I allowed myself to punch someone like this.’ Watch Flower's shocking attack on Hohaia in Grand Final . Wigan prop Ben Flower knocked St Helens stand-off Lance Hohaia to the ground . Wales international Flower then followed up by landing a right hook on the stricken Hohaia . Hohaia was left bruised and dazed and taken to the dressing room for treatment at Old Trafford . Born: October 19, 1987, Cardiff . Position: Prop forward/second row . Height: 6ft Weight: 17st . Career . 2008–11 Crusaders . 2010 South Wales Scorpions (loan) 2011– Wigan . Sixteen caps for Wales . It was an inexcusable attack and few have sought to offer mitigation, beyond reiterating the intensity of the derby between Wigan and Saints, two towns nine miles apart and with a fierce, long-standing rivalry. But the sport now faces an uncomfortable week as it decides how to punish Flower and limit the damage to its image. The incident will likely be referred to an independent disciplinary board, which will sit on Tuesday, chaired by High Court Judge Chris Batty and assisted by former players Danny Sculthorpe and Neil Turley. There is no ceiling to the length of suspension Flower could face, with some calling for him to be banned for life. There is also a possibility that Flower could face criminal charges, despite both Hohaia and St Helens coach Nathan Brown stating they did not want a prosecution. Refeere Phil Bentham shows red card to Wigan prop Flower during Saturday's Grand Final . Flower walks from the Old Trafford pitch after receiving a red card during the Super League Grand Final . 'I am so sorry for what happened on Saturday night. 'There is no defence for my actions. It was something that happened in the heat of the moment when our emotions and adrenaline were running high. I instantly regretted it and am devastated that I allowed myself to punch someone like this. 'At Wigan we are known for being aggressive but we are constantly told to do this within the rules of the game and that punching isn't tough. We may aim to dominate teams, but we don't aim to hurt people. 'I firstly offer my apologies to Lance. I have full respect for him and have never gone onto a rugby field to injure a fellow player. I hope he is okay. 'I'd also like to say sorry to my team-mates, our fans and the Wigan club. I know I've let them down like never before and accept I'll have to live with this for the rest of my career. 'Finally, I'm sorry to the sport of rugby league. It was a big night and I know I've taken the attention away from what was a special event.' A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: ‘We will be liaising with the Rugby Football League, St. Helens and the Crown Prosecution Service before a decision is made on what course of action is to be taken.’ Flower apologised in a carefully constructed 188-word statement. On a weekend when the sport was basking in the spotlight, with no Premier League football, he ensured the match will be remembered for a moment of madness rather than a St Helens side who overcame adversity to win 14-6 and end an eight-year spell without a Grand Final triumph. There was a festival atmosphere before the match with both sets of supporters mingling. One group held up placards spelling ‘RL New Era’ — but Flower’s punch harked back to the dark ages. ‘It’s rare the sport has such a window of opportunity for publicity, falling on an international weekend,’ said Phil Caplan, the editor of Forty-20 magazine. ‘It gave rugby league the sort of profile it’s been craving in the Super League era. The atmosphere at Old Trafford was as good as it ever has been. Then within two minutes the whole thing was turned on its head.’ ‘That is almost the story of rugby league in microcosm — grasping for its opportunity but falling just short. It is sad that this punch will be the defining image of the 2014 season. I believe it was a one-off, uncharacteristic for the player and the sport.’ Hohaia, who watched the rest of the match from the dugout after the punch ended his game, could also face punishment for his off-the-ball shoulder charge on Flower which appeared to provoke the attack. The New Zealander was in a forgiving mood after the game. ‘Those things are best left on the field,’ he said. ‘Sometimes people do silly things that they regret. I am not a person who holds grudges. I am happy to leave that on the field and move forward.’ Flower’s Wigan team-mates, who fought bravely but were unable to hold on to their half-time lead, rallied in support of him. ‘It’s not the image the game wants to portray,’ said Matty Smith. Saints stand-off Hohaia received medical attention after being punched by Flower and could play no further part . ‘He’s punched him on the floor and Benny will learn from that. He’ll be absolutely devastated but we’ll all be behind him. He’s a great lad, he’s passionate, he’s everything about the club, we love him to bits.’ The incident was replayed millions of times on the internet and prompted widespread national debate. The BBC decided it was too brutal to replay on its breakfast news bulletins. ‘I was already thinking about it on my drive into work because it’s a great story and a “wow” moment,’ said BBC Sports News senior producer Ian Kemp. St Helens celebrate a famous victory at Old Trafford after seeing off 12-man Wigan with a second-half salvo . ‘The breakfast producers were talking about it when I arrived. They weren’t comfortable running the pictures. It’s the sheer brutality of it, the guy’s unconscious and takes one right in the face.’ There is little precedence in rugby league to suggest how this storyline will play out but the RFL are expected to work swiftly, with a decision on Flower’s punishment expected in a week. One thing is for sure, the full impact of the punch that shocked the world is yet to be determined.","Ben Flower says he is 'devastated' with the way he behaved .

"No red card, no clean sheet, no points. Neil Lennon’s second match in charge of Bolton could not have been much more different to the first. Instead, having opened with a touchline dismissal and a win at Birmingham, this was something of a wake-up call. First, George Tucudean and then Johnnie Jackson capitalised on shaky defending to put Charlton in control. Dean Moxey pulled one back in the 53rd minute with a sweet drive from 20 yards, but ultimately Bolton lacked the quality and ruthlessness for back-to-back wins. Johnnie Jackson (hidden) celebrates scoring Charlton's second goal with his team-mates . Jordan Cousins vies for the ball with Bolton's Mark Davies in midfield as Charlton came out on top . Charlton (4-4-1-1): Henderson 5.5; Wilson 6, Ben Haim 6, Bikey-Amougou 6, Wiggins 6.5; Bulot 6.5, Buyens 6.5, Jackson 6.5, Cousins 5; Moussa 6; Tucudean 7. Subs not used: Pope, Morrison, Harriott, Ansah, Fox, Munns, Ahearne-Grant. Goals: Tucudean 28, Jackson 51. Booked: Tucudean, Buyens. Bolton (4-2-3-1): Lonergan 6; McNaughton 6, Mills 6, Dervite 6, Moxey 6.5; Danns 5.5, Spearing 6.5; Feeney 6 (M Davies 62, 6), Chung-Yong 6.5, Pratley 6; Beckford 5. Subs not used: Kenny, Ream, Hall, Clayton, Vela, C Davies. Goal: Moxey 54. Booked: Lee . Referee: Simon Hooper . MOTM: George Tucudean . That was never more evident than late in the first half. Darren Pratley had opened Charlton’s defence with a backheel which left back Moxey received on the overlap. His low cross was perfect but Beckford took a big swing and missed the ball altogether. It was a pitiful end to Bolton’s one move of genuine class in the first half. By then they were already 1-0 down. Yoni Buyens made the chance with a delightful ball over the top which Tucudean took down and finished in a smooth, sweet motion. Tucudean was then involved in the second, squaring for Johnnie Jackson to finish in the 51st minute before Moxey drilled home a low shot across Stephen Henderson from 20 yards two minutes later. It was a good strike but not enough to turn the tide. For Charlton, the win keeps them in the chasing pack. But it’s fair to say Bob Peeters’ side did not start this fixture like a unit that only tasted defeat for the first time at the weekend. Inside two minutes Stephen Henderson spilled a weak shot from Lee Chung-Yong and had to scramble to gather the loose ball. Within four Neil Lennon was waving his players forward, such was Charlton’s frailty in possession. Neil Lennon will have been disappointed in what he saw from his side in his second game in charge of Bolton . It was 27 minutes until they had a meaningful opening – Johnnie Jackson scuffing when well placed – and a minute later before they managed a proper shot, from which Tucudean scored for his second of the season. Bolton, for all their hard work, didn’t have much quality to offer in the first half. Beckford’s miss was the low point, even if the move highlighted that they do have guile in the side. Jackson made it 2-0 but Moxey gave Bolton a fighting chance with his impressive finish moments later and Beckford had a header cleared off the line. Lennon said: ‘I think we should have got something but should doesn’t cut it in football. We don’t score enough and we concede too many but the standard of performance was very high. ‘We are losing games and I need to change that very quickly.’ Charlton manager Bob Peeters said: ‘Everyone said we were favourites to get relegated and now we have 22 points.’ Peeters also insisted he had no interest in the managerial vacancy at Standard Liege, who share a chairman - Roland Duchâtelet – with Charlton. Peeters said: ‘I had a meal with him (Duchatelet) on Monday and I am very happy at Charlton. I am not leaving here. I made a commitment to Charlton.’ Dean Moxey smashes home the consolation for the travelling side but in truth Bolton were poor .","George Tucudean and Johnnie Jackson scored a narrow win for Charlton .

"Michael Sam, hoping to become the first openly gay athlete to play in a regular-season game in the National Football League, was signed on Wednesday to the Dallas Cowboys' practice squad. The defensive end then took to the team's practice field in Irving, Texas, outside Dallas, wearing a No 46 Cowboys jersey. Head Coach Jason Garrett told a news conference the rookie from the University of Missouri would be a member of the 10-man practice squad. Sam was cut last week by the St. Louis Rams, who had drafted him in the seventh and final round of the NFL draft in May. Attention: Michael Sam landed in Texas and signed with the Dallas Cowboys practice squad . In the thick of it: Sam padded up and wore the No 46 jersey as he hit the practice field . 'We have had nothing but good reports about him from our people and people in St. Louis,' Garrett said. 'We just want to give him a chance to come in and see if he can help our football team.' The 6-foot-2, 260-pound Sam became the first openly gay player to be selected in the NFL draft. But despite his success at Missouri, talent evaluators have said Sam might struggle in the NFL - perhaps too small to play regularly on the defensive line and not athletic enough to play as a linebacker. Rampage: The defensive end runs a drill during the Cowboys' practice in Irving on Wednesday . Grateful: Sam took to Twitter to say the move to Dallas was a 'dream come true' 'He was a very good player in college. His track record speaks for itself,' Garrett said. Each NFL team has a 10-member practice squad that helps it prepare for games. When teams face injuries, they often look to practice squad players to fill out their game-day rosters as short-term help. Sam, a Texas native, could prove to be a useful backup for the Cowboys because of their strong need for help on defense, which was the bottom-ranked unit in the NFL in the 2013 season. Sam thanked the Cowboys and the city of Dallas for giving him a chance. Optimistic: Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said he had received good reports on Sam . 'As a kid growing up in Texas I always loved the Dallas Cowboys, so to join this incredible organization is really a dream come true,' he wrote on his Twitter feed. There is currently only one openly gay player in North America's four major professional sports leagues - Jason Collins, who joined the National Basketball Association's Brooklyn Nets last season.","Sam signs to Dallas Cowboys' 10-man practice squad .

"It was always going to take more than a dotted white line to curb Neil Lennon’s enthusiasm. It was always going to take more than touchline rules and a red card in his first game to wipe the smile from his face. A debut win will do that for a manager, especially this one who came south to seek his fortune and found a lot of closed doors until he reached the bottom of the Championship. There were times during Lennon’s six-month hunt for a job when the courtesy of a returned call could not even be taken for granted. Bolton Wanderers manager Neil Lennon leaves his technical area to congratulate Matt Mills after his goal . Lennon (right) has accused fourth official Amy Fearne (left) of being 'a bit pedantic' after he was sent off . The new Bolton boss' first game in charge saw them lift off the bottom of the Championship table . His desire to work had reached the point where he was going public with his interest in certain vacancies, namely those at Cardiff and Fulham. Yet the inexplicable truth is that a manager who beat Barcelona on a budget with Celtic was not getting much of a sniff in England. A source close to the Northern Irishman told Sportsmail recently that one of the second-tier clubs approached by Lennon’s representative had failed to respond to half a dozen messages. But Lennon is nothing if not a scrapper. To Bolton he went and on Saturday, with a win at Birmingham, he began the climb. It was quite some entrance; it was quite some demonstration of the kind of feisty behaviour for which he became known in Scotland. When Matt Mills headed the 20th-minute goal that turned out to be the winner, Lennon crossed the line that no manager must cross. He left his technical area on a fist-pumping sprint 30 yards towards the corner flag. It’s a shame Burnley boss Sean Dyche has already claimed the Ginger Mourinho nickname. Amy Fearn, the fourth official, was waiting with a warning when he got back. ‘You have to celebrate,’ he said after the game. ‘We have lost five in a row, confidence is lower than a snake’s belly. Then you get a goal.’ He stepped out again in the 83rd minute when Craig Davies was brought down for a penalty and appeared keen to take the kick. With Birmingham goalkeeper Darren Randolph sent off and midfielder Lee Novak taking the gloves, it was an appealing scenario. Except Lennon wanted Jay Spearing or Lee Chung-Yong to take the kick. Or Jermaine Beckford. He repeated the error of leaving his box to pass this instruction to Kevin McNaughton but Fearn intervened before calling over referee Mark Haywood. He sent Lennon to the stands. Rules are rules. A popular figure at Celtic, Lennon struggled to find work in England despite having a commendable CV . Victor Wanyama scores a goal in Celtic's famous win against Barcelona at home in November 2012 . ‘If I was arguing constantly or having a go at Lee (Clark, the Birmingham manager) and swearing (it would be different) but there was none of that. ‘I’ve been sent to the stands when I was manager of Celtic and deserved to be, but not here.’ Davies took the penalty and missed. Lennon, sat behind the dugout, watched on as Birmingham launched a last wave. But Bolton stood firm to get off the foot of the table. ‘One from one is all I can ask,’ Lennon said. Lennon and Birmingham manager Lee Clark exchange pleasantries ahead of Saturday's game at St. Andrew's . The Northern Irishman joined Bolton in early October having previously shown interest in other vacancies . Lennon is already making a mark on Bolton and has imposed a ban on players wearing hats during training . Except he will ask for a lot more. He has already told the players they cannot wear hats in training. ‘I don’t mind them warming up in hats but you don’t head balls in games in hats,’ he said. It’s why some Trotters fans came to the match in bobble hats. They have already taken to the new man. Within 10 minutes they were asking for a wave and he obliged. They know better than to demand a win — but they got one of those as well. There might be more under this manager. At the very least, English football is more interesting because they finally let him in.","Neil Lennon claimed confidence at Bolton was 'lower than a snake’s belly'

"Barcelona striker Neymar is refusing to be distracted by the impending El Clasico and Real Madrid - instead insisting that victory over Ajax in the Champions League is of paramount importance. The Brazil striker scored in Barcelona's  3-2 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes Stadium last month, and believes hitting back with a victory in Europe's elite competition would be perfect preparation for Madrid. 'Tuesday we have a match we have to win, and only after that we will start thinking about El Clasico. What is more important for me - scoring tomorrow or scoring at the Santiago Bernabeu?

"Schalke 04 are hoping their new-found discipline under new coach Robert Di Matteo, coupled with his Champions League pedigree will help them beat Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday for their first win in the competition this season. Italian Di Matteo, who replaced Jens Keller, enjoyed a successful debut on the Schalke bench with a 2-0 victory over Hertha Berlin on Saturday in what also was only their second clean sheet of the league so far. The former Chelsea coach, who won the Champions League in a caretaker role in 2012, must now also kickstart their European campaign after two draws in Group G against Chelsea and Maribor. VIDEO Scroll down to see Di Matteo get off to a winning start with 2-0 win over Hertha Berlin . Roberto Di Matteo took over as Schalke boss from Jens Keller after a poor start to the season . The former Chelsea boss speaks to his team in training before the Champions League clash with Sporting . 'What was positive was the win and the clean sheet,' Di Matteo said following Saturday's win which lifted them back up the Bundesliga table into eighth place after a rollercoaster start to the season. 'Our defence was good and the organisation of the team was also good. We have to increase our possession and play better between the lines. But we cannot change everything at once.' Schalke looked sharp in attack, with midfielder Julian Draxler and Dutch forward Klaas-Jan Huntelaar on target. Di Matteo, whose appointment is the first since his Chelsea sacking in late 2012, will be hoping the striker's streak in Europe also continues after having scored in both the previous group games this season. Schalke are yet to win in the Champions League after a draw with Chelsea and a home draw with Maribor . 'Our focus is now on Sporting and success in this game in the Champions League,' said Di Matteo. Di Matteo will be able to count on captain Benedikt Hoewedes, after the Germany defender started against Hertha following a five-week break with a hip injury. Defender Jan Kirchhoff also returned to action, making a brief substitute appearance against Hertha, his first since suffering a knee injury in August. 'We have not taken a huge step but we did take an important step forward,' Hoewedes said. 'We have to remain patient and keep working and push ourselves forward bit by bit.' Di Matteo celebrates on the touchline during the 2-0 win over Hertha Berlin on Saturday in the Bundesliga . For bottom-placed Sporting, a win is of paramount importance to maintain their chances of advancing, having collected only one point in their two games so far.

The Portuguese, however, enjoyed a confidence-boosting 3-1 win over Porto on Saturday for a spot in the Portuguese Cup fourth round.

On the back of their ninth one-two of the campaign - one short of McLaren's record set in 1988 - Mercedes captured the constructors' crown for the first time in their long motorsport history. Red Bull's Christian Horner has warned Mercedes that his team will be back stronger next year . Horner, pictured here talking to Bernie Ecclestone, wants Red Bull to reclaim the constructors' championship . 2014 - Mercedes . 2013 - Red Bull . 2012 - Red Bull . 2011 - Red Bull . 2010 - Red Bull . 2009 - Brawn GP . 2008 - Ferrari . 2007 - Ferrari . 2006 - Renault . 2005 - Renault . Horner was always aware the day would come, almost from the first day of pre-season given the woes of their own power-unit supplier Renault. Plagued by countless problems, Red Bull barely covered any mileage in pre-season testing, yet despite that they are certain to finish as runners-up, with Daniel Ricciardo winning three races. Paying respect to Mercedes' performance, Horner said: 'Congratulations to Mercedes and all their guys who have designed and made the power unit. They've done a really incredible job this year. 'They're deserving champions, with the constructors' trophy going 12 miles up the road.' Members of the Mercedes team celebrate winning the constructors' championship at the Russian Grand Prix . Lewis Hamilton (centre) and Nico Rosberg (left) finished first and second in Sochi on Sunday to wrap up Mercedes' first constructors' championship . With a smile, Horner added: 'We've had a little bit of time to get our heads round it - from February in reality. 'In all honesty, Mercedes have done the best job this year, but all it does is motivate you. 'You know how much work goes into winning a championship, and to win it four times in a row is an enormous achievement. 'We've had a disastrous year, but we're still second and we're the only (other) team to have won a grand prix, and three of them at that this year. Hamilton wore a new t-shirt made for him after Mercedes secured the 2014 constructors' championship . 'What we've managed to recover out of this season, and the fact we have managed to take them this far into it, is very much a result in itself.' Horner, though, is eager to ensure Mercedes' time as champion is as short-lived as possible. 'Hopefully next year we'll put up a good fight to try and get it back to Milton Keynes,' said Horner. 'Hopefully as the power units converge into next season we should be able to give them a much bigger fight.'","Mercedes secured the constructors' championship at Russian Grand Prix .

"Ferrari have ended speculation surrounding Fernando Alonso's future - with their outgoing president confirming he will cut short the Spaniard's contract at the end of the season. Alonso was widely rumoured to be leaving the team he has been part of since 2010, but Luca Di Montezemolo finally provided confirmation that he would be heading for the exit on Italian television. 'Fernando is leaving for two reasons,' Di Montezemolo said. 'One, he wants another environment. Two, because he is an age when he cannot wait to win again.' Ferrari's Fernando Alonso (right) says it is 'unlikely' that he will be driving for Mercedes next season . Alonso is said to have lost faith in Ferrari's ability to produce a winning car as he currently sits sixth in the drivers' championship with three races remaining. 'He was disappointed that he has not won over these last years and wanted new stimulus,' Di Montezemolo confirmed. Alonso gave a hint about his Formula One future at Sunday's Russian Grand Prix by saying the decision would seem obvious once announced and he was unlikely to drive for a Mercedes-powered team. 'I'm not in a hurry...I understand the curiosity, and I understand, for the fans, the news that can be around the future,' the Spaniard told reporters. 'But do not worry, do not worry. Just relax, enjoy, and when it's time to know it, you will know it. Alonso has been at Ferrari since 2010, but has never won a Championship with the Italian team . 'My mind is set, for the last two or three months, and when you know you will understand that probably it was very obvious what I would do,' added the double world champion. In a separate interview with NBC television, Alonso said 'I don't think so' when asked if he would be driving for a team with Mercedes engines. That would appear to leave only a return to McLaren, who are starting a new partnership with Honda, or staying at Ferrari as the 33-year-old's realistic options of a drive given that Renault-powered Red Bull have announced a 2015 line-up. Although Alonso has a contract at Ferrari until the end of 2016, he is expected to leave at the end of the year to make way for four-times champion Sebastian Vettel. Kimi Raikkonen, Ferrari's 2007 champion, has a contract for 2015 but has been eclipsed by Alonso this year. Spanish driver Alonso could yet remain with Ferrari, but only if Kimi Raikkonen leaves the team . Vettel announced last week that he was leaving Red Bull at the end of the year, with his team's principal Christian Horner saying the driver was heading for Ferrari. Neither Ferrari nor the German have confirmed anything. Maintaining the intrigue, Alonso also said he wanted to do his best for the future of Ferrari. 'My decision...was to help this fantastic team, and I'm extremely happy with the things that will come,' he said. Sebastian Vettel (right) is reported to be joining Ferrari, but it hasn't yet been announced .","Fernando Alonso set to leave Ferrari after five seasons .

"Jan Vertonghen will not be signing a new contract at Tottenham, although the defender insists he remains 'very happy' at White Hart Lane. The 27-year-old has been one of Spurs' best performers during the often tumultuous period since arriving from Ajax in 2012. Such form has seen Vertonghen regularly linked with a move away from north London, although he looked set to follow Hugo Lloris, Danny Rose and Harry Kane in signing a new long-term deal this summer. Jan Vertonghen is satisfied with live at Tottenham currently but is in no rush to sign a new deal . Vertonghen looks on after missing a gilt-edged chance in the Capital One Cup against Nottingham Forest . Two weeks ago his agent, Mustapha Nakhli, said he was close to agreeing a new long-term deal at Spurs, although Vertonghen says those negotiations have now ended. 'I am not signing, no,' Vertonghen said. 'We agreed not to. 'I would prefer not to say why. I still have four years left. I am happy at the club and I think they are happy with me. That's where it ends. 'I am very happy, we have a good manager, we have a good team and a lot of good players. 'The squad is very big and you have to work hard to play every game and I hope I am playing again soon.' The news will come as a blow to Spurs fans, many of whom have been surprised by his lack of opportunities under Mauricio Pochettino in recent weeks. Previously one of the first names on the team sheet, he has found time restricted as the former Argentina international rotates his side. 'I hope I play every game in the weekends and midweek,' Vertonghen said, having been restored to the starting line-up for the 3-1 Capital One Cup win against Nottingham Forest. 'I want to play in the biggest games. That is what you are a footballer for. 'We have got a lot of centre-backs now with Fazio, with Eric Dier who is doing very well. 'Obviously Vlad (Chiriches) and Younes (Kaboul) played at the weekend and we are fighting for two places with those guys. 'Everyone has to be just that little bit better so the manager chooses them.' Rumours have grown of an issue between Pochettino and Vertonghen, although the Belgian was quick to dismiss such talk. 'He is working well with a lot of videos and individually he talks a lot with the players,' he said. Vertonghen was quick to quash any rumours that he and manager Mauricio Pochettino have fallen out . Pochettinho expresses his frustration during their home defeat to West Brom last weekend . 'He is a manager who expects a lot from players. We work hard and that is good - it will pay off in the end, I think.' Wednesday's defeat of Forest was a timely shot in the arm for Spurs after a four-match winless streak. Extending that run further would have made life in tougher heading to the Emirates Stadium this weekend to take on bitter rivals Arsenal. 'It is a very good team,' Vertonghen said. 'They have got a lot of good players and I think they improved every year since I came here. 'They have got a very good team at the moment with the pace they have got up front with Welbeck, who I think is a very good signing, and Alexis as well. 'They have got a lot of creativity and movement and they are just one of the best teams in the league and very difficult to beat, especially at their ground.' Spurs' determination to do well at the Emirates was highlighted by the 11 changes they made against Forest, who themselves made nine alterations as they look to keep their promotion charge on track. One of those coming in was 19-year-old Jorge Grant, who capped his full debut with a goal that looked like it would hand Stuart Pearce's side victory. Efforts from Ryan Mason, Roberto Soldado and Kane put paid to that, though, on a night that will live long in the midfielder's memory despite the defeat. 'I'll remember that forever,' Grant said. 'It was my first start and to get a goal was great but we wanted to win the game really and it's unlucky that we haven't.'","Jan Vertonghen insists he won't be signing a new deal at Tottenham in the near future .

"Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart has hailed the brilliance of Sergio Aguero - although he claims he is 'useless' in training. City's star striker Aguero underlined his return to form this season with a superb four-goal demolition of Tottenham on Saturday. Aguero scored all the goals as the champions won 4-1 at the Etihad Stadium in the Barclays Premier League, taking his tally for the campaign to 10 in all competitions. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart says the club's star striker Sergio Aguero is useless in training . Argentina international Aguero has already notched nine goals in the Premier League this season . That included four during the demolition of Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham Hotspur at the Etihad Stadium . It also made the Argentinian City's record goalscorer in the Premier League with 61 and took him to 85 goals in 132 appearances for the club overall. It was an emphatic reminder of the 26-year-old's talents now that the muscle injuries which hampered him during the latter half of last season and the World Cup appear behind him. Hart said: 'He is one of those players - and I don't think he will be unhappy with me saying it - that some days you look at him in training and he is useless! 'That is just down to him, and you know that when it comes to games he is going to score, because he is that talented, that good a player. 'He is a big-match player and deserves to be at a big club like this, scoring goals for these fans, and I can't be positive enough about him. He deserves all the plaudits he gets. 'Finishing-wise he is one of the best and his goals-to-games ratio in the Premier League is the best.' Hart - pictured celebrating Aguero's fourth goal on Saturday - believes the striker is a 'big-match' player . Aguero's statistics in that regard are certainly impressive. His 61 Premier League goals have come in 95 appearances and he averages a goal every 108.3 minutes, according to Opta. That is the most clinical ratio in Premier League history, ahead of Thierry Henry (121.8) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (128.2) - although both of them played many more minutes. Hart said: 'He still has a lot of work to do. He is only young and hopefully, if we keep him fit, he will be pushing on.'

"Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has revealed he would like to return to the Premier League should he leave the Spanish giants before he retires. The former Chelsea boss won the league and FA Cup in his first year in charge at Stamford Bridge in 2010 - the Blues' first ever double - but was sacked by Roman Abramovich a year later. The 55-year-old Italian was then appointed manager of Paris Saint-Germain and won the Ligue 1 title in his second season in charge, before winning the Champions League with Real last year. Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has admitted that he would love to manage in the Premier League again . Ancelotti spent two seasons at Chelsea and won the Premier League and FA Cup at Stamford Bridge in 2010 . Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo scores to help Ancelotti's side beat Levante 5-0 on Saturday . Despite his controversial exit from Stamford Bridge, Ancelotti still harbours the ambition of once again managing in English football. 'I loved England I was very happy at Chelsea,' he told The Sun. 'I liked the atmosphere, the supporters. I have the best memories. 'I'd like to return. It depends how long this adventure lasts. If it lasts a long time I will retire after it. But if it doesn't then I will come to England. For sure. 'The day I leave Madrid there are two solutions. Either I quit football or I come back to England.' Ancelotti, pictured celebrating with his Chelsea players in May 2010, has not ruled out a return to his old club . Real travel to England to face Liverpool in the Champions League at Anfield on Wednesday evening . Ancelotti, who also denied reports that he was approached to succeed both Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes as Manchester United manager, is open to a return to Chelsea but doubts that such a move would materialise. 'No, I don't think Abramovich will change his mind. I know he did with (Jose) Mourinho. As I said I have no problem with Abramovich. 'They were two beautiful years. But it's not about a particular club, it's about the atmosphere. 'But I don't say no. I certainly wouldn't say no.'","Carlo Ancelotti says he will retire if he stays at Real Madrid for a long time .

"Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone is to ask his team-mates to refund the money spent on tickets and travel by fans who saw their team’s capitulation against Southampton. Some fans were in tears as Sunderland were humiliated 8-0 — one of the heaviest defeats in Barclays Premier League history. Manager Gus Poyet claimed the defeat was his most embarrassing moment in football. The squad had the day off on Sunday with Poyet wanting to allow the dust to settle before addressing them. Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone wants his team-mates to refund travelling supporters . Mannone's Sunderland side were thrashed 8-0 by Southampton on a miserable afternoon on the south coast . Santiago Vergini set the tone for the afternoon by smashing the ball into his own net with a comical own goal . When they meet for training on Monday, Mannone is intent on arranging compensation for fans who made the 650-mile round trip to St Mary’s. ‘I will talk to the team to see if it is possible to pay their tickets and their trip,’ Mannone said. ‘It is difficult for us but it’s very difficult for them as well.’ Three of Southampton’s goals were gifted by Sunderland. Liam Bridcutt and Santiago Vergini — with what will surely go down as own goal of the season — put the ball in their own net while Mannone’s poor clearance allowed Dusan Tadic to score past him. ‘After we conceded we threw in the towel and I include myself,’ admitted Mannone. ‘We lost 8-0 but we didn’t lose eight games 1-0. Let’s take it on the chin and go again.’ Ronald Koeman's Southampton side continued their impressive run with a dominant victory .

"Steve Parish will hand manager Neil Warnock a January transfer kitty, but still expects Crystal Palace to turn other club's cast-offs into Premier League success stories. Palace co-owner Parish confirmed Warnock will have licence to strengthen the Eagles' squad when the transfer window reopens, despite a raft of September arrivals. Warnock launched his second spell as Palace boss by setting a £7million club transfer record to bring in Scotland midfielder James McArthur from Wigan. Crystal Palace owner Steve Parish has revealed that Neil Warnock will receive transfer funds in January . Warnock has started his second spell at Palace in impressive vein so far with the club looking on the up . Parish will also let Warnock loose in January's market, but warned the club will not abandon the prudent principals that have underpinned their top-flight return. 'There's money available - if we get the right targets,' said Parish. 'But sometimes you don't have to spend money. 'It's almost now like there's a league table of who's spent what. People believe that's how the real league table is going to finish. 'We will look at opportunities where we can strengthen our football club. 'We're not going to sign players and Neil won't sign players that he doesn't think are better than anybody we've got. That would upset the apple cart. 'That's not easy, signing players that are better than what you've got and then your academy kids coming through, it's not easy. Jason Puncheon has been in impressive form for Crystal Palace since joining little over a year ago . 'We've built this club by taking people fundamentally that no one else wanted. 'The core group that are performing in the Premier League, for whatever reason have been undervalued.' Parish believes mainstays like Jason Puncheon and summer recruit Martin Kelly from Liverpool prove Palace's ability to help top-flight strays find a Premier League home in south London. The Palace chairman admitted even he was caught out by football's inflated transfer market when ex-manager Tony Pulis championed the arrival of defender Scott Dann. 'Scott Dann is a fantastic player. He's a much, much better player than I thought he was, I must admit,' said Parish. 'Credit to Tony Pulis: he always liked him when he was at Birmingham. 'There's value in the market place everywhere if you look at it. Maybe sometimes you have to find it. 'That's the difference: we have to find it. It's a very imperfect transfer market. 'If you're not playing for six to eight months or happen to be playing in a bad side, you just get forgotten about and nobody wants you. 'It doesn't mean you're a bad player. We've had to look at value from the first point when I came into the club. James McArthur cost Crystal Palace a club-record £7million when he joined from Wigan . 'We know right now there's a certain type of player. If you look at someone like Martin Kelly, he has an England cap, he's been through some injuries like a lot of younger players do. 'He hasn't been playing regularly for Liverpool and England but you don't suddenly become a bad player overnight. 'We figure that it's a risk worth taking. We can't go and pay £5-10million for players in those types of positions.' Midfielder Puncheon's public spat with Warnock last term could have destabilised the new manager's eve-of-season arrival. Warnock criticised Puncheon's missed penalty against Tottenham, with the pair trading public insults and landing in hot disciplinary water. Parish praised them for settling their 'stupid differences', with ex-Southampton midfielder Puncheon maintaining his impressive Palace form. 'They're two grown ups, they had a chat and went out to dinner and they've sorted themselves out,' said Parish. 'Every single person that meets Neil realises that he's not that person people think he is. 'It's all behind us and Jason has been absolutely amazing for our football club. 'When you watch what he does week in, week out, how hard he works for the team, that hasn't changed one bit. 'Any stupid differences they've had have all been settled, so it's absolutely fine and credit to both of them really.'","Steve Parish will back his manager in the January transfer window with funds to strengthen the team .

"Early evening on Monday night and the Arena Khimki could not have looked less inviting as Manchester City trained in solitude in the sleet of an early winter' s day. When they face CSKA for real later on Tuesday, there is no reason to suspect it will be any different. Certainly it won't get any warmer. Temperatures are predicted to be as low as minus five by the time this crucial Group E game kicks off at 8pm local time on Tuesday. Nor will this rather mundane stadium be any more atmospheric. A UEFA sanction means CSKA must face City behind closed doors. The Manchester City squad brave the freezing temperatures in Moscow on Monday night in training . Manager Manuel Pellegrini says the empty stadium for the Champions League match will not benefit Man City . Sergio Aguero (centre) , scored all four goals on Sunday in the 4-1 win over Tottenham, runs in training . Punishment designed to affect the home team, it was tempting to wonder last night if it will do Pellegrini and his players any favours either. Players, after all, rely at least in part on some kind of atmosphere to quicken the blood and last night City's manager offered his own words of regret that this is the path the European governing body have chosen in the wake of violence and racist chanting that marred CSKA games last season. Pellegrini said: 'It will be very strange with everybody being able to hear the players' voices during the game. But we have no option and we must play that way. 'Many may think the local team will suffer the most damage, but I think the biggest loser is the game of football. City stopper Joe Hart is all smiles in training in Moscow as his side prepare for playing CSKA on Tuesday . City stars were feeling the chill as many trained in snoods and winter garments ahead of the game . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany bares the cold in Moscow wearing a snood in training . 'It's a pity that we can't play with fans. This show is for fans and it will be a strange game.' It was easy to understand Pellegrini's standpoint. The stadium will certainly have a strange feel on Tuesday. What he must hope is that his players rise to the occasion in their minds at least. Having taken just a point from two opening games, City must win in Moscow if their Champions League hopes are not to disappear down the river for another season. City's Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho said: 'I have experienced it twice before and it is different. You have to keep your concentration on the pitch and try to win the game. Pellegrini addresses his squad as he attempts to guide City to their first Champions League win this season . City have yet to pick up their first win in Group E, having lost to Bayern Munich and drawn with Roma .

'It is always good when you play away because the home fans support their team and it gives you more motivation to play well. 'I don't think this [a closed stadium] is good for either team or for football.' CSKA's players did their best to liven up things up a bit on Monday by suggesting their opponents from the Premier League have some weaknesses when they don't have the ball. Maybe they were watching as Tottenham troubled City sporadically at the weekend. Striker Ahmed said: 'As you can see, City are very weak this year. We are going to use that advantage against them. 'In a couple of games they haven't been that good. They are very weak in the defence, so we are going to do our best to work against that. 'I think we are going to have a great opportunity and Tuesday is going to be a very good game for us. 'We are going to do our best to win because this is the last opportunity that we have.' Quite properly, Pellegrini did not respond when asked about this on Monday. The Chilean knows that if City play anywhere near to their capabilities they will win the game, just as they did here last year. The City coach was willing to talk about his own midfielder Yaya Toure, though, and rejected suggestions that the Ivorian's future may lie as a second striker after rather indifferent European displays at the base of his team's midfield at Bayern Munich and at home to Roma. Fernadinho shows off his skills in training, has experience of playing matches in 'empty' stadiums . Anyone who has seen Toure play this season will recognise that he is becoming something of a liability alongside Fernandinho when not at his best. His midfield partner had to do so much work in Munich that he ended the night with cramp. However, Pellegrini insisted last night that the 31-year-old will be back to his best before long and remains of the Premier League's most eminent players in his natural position. Asked if Toure's future lies further up the field, Pellegrini said: 'It can be an option because he has the quality to play behind the striker. 'But in our team he's a very important midfielder and he will continue to play in that role. 'When he plays well in his midfield position he is the best at that role in the Premier League.' Despite the peculiar circumstances on Tuesday, they perhaps represents City's biggest game of the season. Ahead of the return next month, they are already offering two tickets for the price of one. Lose tonight and even that may not be enough to drag them through the gates. Matija Nastasic (left), Stevan Jovetic, Aleksandar Kolarov and Edin Dzeko train in Moscow on Monday .

"In a statement that should be of interest to Mario Balotelli, Steven Gerrard has claimed Liverpool's famous 4-0 win against Real Madrid in 2009 was due to the aggression showed by their outstanding centre-forward on the night, Fernando Torres. Although current Champions League holders Real are favourites at Anfield on Wednesday night, one factor in Liverpool's favour is their last European clash – which The Reds won 5-0 on aggregate in the last-16 of the competition. Gerrard scored twice in the Anfield romp and Torres and Andrea Dossena were also on target for Rafa Benitez's side in a humiliation for the Spanish side that prompted them to go out and spend £80million on Cristiano Ronaldo the following summer. Steven Gerrard credited 'world class' Fernando Torres for Liverpool's famous win against Real Madrid . Steven Gerrard shakes hands with Raul after the Champions League clash, which ended 4-0 to Liverpool . Gerrard said the win was all thanks to the aggression shown by their outstanding centre-forward on the night . 'The reason we came out on top that night was because we were very aggressive with and without the ball,' said Gerrard. 'We pressed from the front and had a world-class talent there in Fernando Torres. He set the tempo up front and we all came behind him. We forced Real Madrid into mistakes.' His comments will surely interest Balotelli who has struck a lethargic figure in a disappointing start to his Anfield career. Manager Brendan Rodgers has a big choice whether to stick with the Italian after he fluffed more chances at QPR on Sunday but for now the Liverpool boss is trying to encourage his £16million striker, who is needed with Luis Suarez gone and Daniel Sturridge injured for a further month. 'Mario was of course disappointed at the weekend. He is a goalscorer and wants to score. But I have highlighted to him he is getting into the positions. As long as he is in there with the possibility to score, I have every confidence he will score. 'Of course he has scored important goals in big games in his career so I am sure if selected he will have a good chance of doing that for us.'

"Wales' preparations for the World Cup next year are set to include training camps in Switzerland and Qatar. Wales coach Warren Gatland confirmed the plans during the launch of a new partnership between the Welsh Rugby Union and Mercedes-Benz South Wales on Wednesday that will see cars provided to coaches, players and staff until 2018. The camps are set to take place ahead of Wales' World Cup warm-up games next summer. Preparation: Wales will head to Switzerland and Qatar for training camps before the World Cup in 2015 . Ready: Wales head coach Warren Gatland wants to ensure his players are in peak condition for next year . 'We have got a high-altitude camp in Switzerland, which is being planned, and we are doing a warm weather camp in Qatar,' Gatland said. 'I think we have got 12-14 days in Switzerland. We are going to sleep high, train low, going up by cable car to sleep. 'We have had that planning in place for the last three months or so and have prepared for all that. 'The thing with the altitude training is not so much that you train at it, it's just the physiological benefits you get from it. 'The challenge is doing that in Switzerland at altitude and also at 45-50 degrees centigrade in Qatar.' Deal: Wales players, coaches and backroom staff will get Mercedes-Benz cars in a new agreement . Under the deal with Mercedes, a total of 89 new cars will be distributed throughout the WRU's workforce, including to Gatland and his coaching assistants Rob Howley, Robin McBryde, Shaun Edwards and Neil Jenkins. 'This is the latest new sponsorship agreement for the WRU Group, following on from the announcement of our new international travel partner last month,' WRU chief executive Roger Lewis said. 'This is perhaps an appropriate time for us to reflect upon the high value of the WRU brand itself in the global market-place.'

"Warren Gatland hopes that Wales' first dual-contracted players could be signed up during the next 'three or four weeks'. A number of Test stars are set to pen deals that will be funded by the Welsh Rugby Union and Wales' four professional regional teams. The initiative is part of a new six-year agreement recently thrashed out between the WRU and regions following months of often bitter in-fighting. Wales coach Warren Gatland hopes the first dual contracts will be signed in the next 'three or four' weeks . An annual pot of £3.3million will fund national player contracts, with the WRU making a 60 per cent contribution and regions 40 per cent. Wales captain Sam Warburton has already been moved from a central contract to a dual one, while colleagues who sign dual deals could include the likes of Alun-Wyn Jones, Gethin Jenkins, Taulupe Faletau, Alex Cuthbert and Dan Biggar. 'We have put a list together and we have to present that to the PRGB (Professional Regional Game Board) about potential players we are interested in,' Wales coach Gatland said. 'We have got a finite amount of money. Hopefully, we can get between 10 and 15 players to be on those dual contracts and for the players to be excited about being on them. 'The money is there, it is coming from the same pot, it's just how it's being spread out. Hopefully, in the next three or four weeks we will get players signed on a national dual contract. 'For them, they will have the certainty of where they are going to be the next two or three years or whatever, and what is associated with having a dual contract. 'The players we are looking at for dual contracts are already in contract. They are already signed up to their clubs, so they are fairly secure.' Wales captain Sam Warburton has been moved to a dual contract from a central one . Wales have suffered more than most during recent seasons with leading players - individuals such as Jamie Roberts, Jonathan Davies, Leigh Halfpenny, George North and Dan Lydiate - opting to ply their trade in France and England. But Gatland is confident that the introduction of dual contracts could generate a reverse of that market trend. 'I can understand why players want to go to France for a short period and experience life out there - two or three seasons,' he added. 'Money has been the driving factor, but then they have realised that playing in a good side and being happy, hopefully have good coaching and longevity of career, that a lot of other factors come into play about making those decisions. 'I think we will hopefully see, over the next couple of seasons, a number of players returning from France. 'We are limited by the amount of money we have got. We only have a finite amount, and possibly, the number will go down. 'Most rugby contracts, unfortunately, don't tend to go down, they tend to go up, so we will probably end up with less players on dual contracts. Gethin Jenkins (centre) is one of a number of players in line for a new dual contract . 'But you never know, with new TV deals and sponsorship, there might be more money to go into that pot to attract players. 'We have got to be aware of that over the next few weeks, when we do those dual contracts, to potentially leave some money there to try and attract one or two players back from overseas next season.' Gatland, meanwhile, revealed on Wednesday that Wales' preparations for the World Cup next year are set to include training camps in Switzerland and Qatar. Gatland confirmed the plans during the launch of a new partnership between the Welsh Rugby Union and Mercedes-Benz South Wales that will see cars provided to coaches, players and staff until 2018.

"Powerful lights confiscated by police during marijuana raids are now being used by the groundsman of League One club Rochdale to help grass grow on its pitch. Police donated the lights to the club last week to avoid having to pay for their disposal, after groundsman Oli Makin approached them having heard of a similar deal working with Notts County. Makin bolted together two old goalposts, attached the lights and placed the rig over damaged areas of the playing field, such as the goalmouth. Oli Makin poses in front of the new lights with a police officer after the expensive equipment was donated . Makin says 'we wouldn't be able to buy the rigs that Premier League clubs have because of the cost - the small ones cost £30,000.' Detective Inspector Jim Faulkner told the Manchester Evening News: 'I think it's a great idea - it's helping to grow the right kind of grass. 'It's criminal property that would have ordinarily been destroyed, but now it can help the local community free of charge and prevents it from being dumped in a landfill.' Makin is using the lights to help regrow areas of the pitch which are worse for wear, such as the goalmouth .","Police had taken the lights from criminals using them to grow cannabis .

"For a generation of women, Carrie Bradshaw was synonymous with sex, shopping and, above all else, shoes. Her walk-in wardrobe may have been crammed with designer clothes and handbags, but her skyscraper Manolos, Louboutins and Jimmy Choos were the real stars of Sex And The City. So it’s no surprise that Sarah Jessica Parker has designed her own shoe range inspired by her character’s collection. But are they anywhere near as stylish — and are they as agonising to walk in as Carrie’s towering shoes looked? RUBY WARRINGTON puts them to the test ...

"QPR 2-3 Liverpool: Click here to read Neil Ashton's match report from Loftus Road . Brendan Rodgers may suggest otherwise, but things just aren't clicking for Mario Balotelli in England. The Liverpool striker looked off the pace again against QPR on Sunday, missing an open goal and frustrating team-mates with his decision-making in the final third. Balotelli is still yet to hit the back of the net in his second spell in the Premier League following his £16m move from AC Milan, and fans may run out of patience. Mario Balotelli struggled against QPR on Sunday and is still yet to score a Premier League goal with Liverpool . Brendan Rodgers looks on at Loftus Road... he said that Balotelli is 'working really hard' to improve . Balotelli's Liverpool team-mates, including Adam Lallana, were often questioning his decision making . Scored just one goal in his last 22 Premier League appearances, despite attempting 73 shots (incl. blocked) in these games. Has now had 30 shots this season in the Premier League (incl. blocks). Only two players (Aguero 36, Pelle 32) have had more. Has attempted more shots (30, incl. blocked) without actually scoring than any other player in the top five European leagues this season. 'It'll drop for the boy,' Rodgers told reporters after the game at Loftus Road. 'The most important thing to me is his work rate. He's working really hard. It'll drop for him.' Putting in the effort for his team is not a characteristic familiar with Balotelli, who often shied away from challenges with opposing centre backs Steven Caulker and Richard Dunne during the win. In fact, the 24-year-old has laid on just one assist in his Premier League career to date - with two years at Manchester City included - while he is experiencing the second longest goal drought of his career (10 league games). Strikers struggle to hide behind such damning statistics, and Balotelli did anything but that with his second-half miss. Adam Lallana's shot was parried by goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, leaving 'Super Mario' with a simple task from eight yards out. However, the ball ballooned over the bar, much to the amusement of the home fans. Balotelli blazed over the bar from eight yards... and did nothing to suggest he was going to make amends . The striker is easily brushed aside by QPR defender Richard Dunne... Liverpool eventually won the game 3-2 . Balotelli's heat map... click here for more stats . Such a miss won't do anything for Balotelli, or his current perception in the public eye. This is a man who was brought in to replace Luis Suarez, a player presumably capable of filling in for Daniel Sturridge, too. Rodgers, though, attempted to divert any comparisons between his under-performing striker and Suarez. 'He's seen as a direct replacement to Luis [Suarez]. I've said before, Luis is irreplaceable, a real world-class talent. 'That's not what's being asked of Mario. He's a great boy, I've enjoyed working with him. He wants to be better. He's a completely different player to Luis.' Suarez was constantly the man getting Liverpool out of trouble, and would have been eager to make a mends had he been the one guilty of missing a gilt-edged opportunity. Balotelli barely celebrated when his side wrapped up the three points. 'I can see already that the Liverpool fans really like me, although I know that maybe they are a little upset because I don't score,' Balotelli told Sport Magazine last week. He had better hope that time comes soon, or fans may not 'really like him' for much longer. Rodgers has tried to avoid comparisons between Luis Suarez (31 league goals last season) and Balotelli .

"Warren Gatland believes Wales can build with confidence towards the World Cup despite their latest agonising defeat to a southern hemisphere giant. Wales had been on course for a first ever win over South Africa on Springbok soil when they led 30-24 in the dying moments of the second Test in Nelspruit. But their hopes were dashed when an illegal challenge by Scarlets full-back Liam Williams on Boks wing Cornal Hendricks resulted in a penalty try, which Morne Steyn converted to give the home side a 31-30 victory and a 2-0 Test series success. Upbeat: Warren Gatland is happy so far with Wales' build-up to next summer's World Cup . Penalised: Wales lost the game against South Africa after Liam Williams (15) was penalised for an illegal challenge . Having turned in disappointing performances against England and Ireland in the Six Nations, as well as in the first Test in Durban, plenty of questions had been asked of the tourists just 15 months out from next year's global showpiece. But they answered their critics in fine style, with the likes of Gethin Jenkins, tireless skipper Alun-Wyn Jones and Taulupe Faletau producing monumental individual displays. Gatland admits a win against one of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia is needed by his side with the knowledge their World Cup group contains two heavyweights in the Wallabies and hosts England. But the New Zealander felt the second Test performance has highlighted his men can compete with the best in the game. Tireless: Alun Wyn Jones was superb against the Springboks . Powerful: As was Taulupe Faletau . He said: 'Sometimes you play against the best teams in the world and our players that come in haven't always played at the same level of intensity. 'That's why we got caught out last week, particularly in the first half. 'We were also caught out in the first Test in Australia a couple of years ago and in the first Test in New Zealand in 2010 as well. 'But the boys have got comfortable with the pace and intensity and have come out and improved their performances in the second week. 'We have such a small playing base of players. We have got an incredibly tough pool for the World Cup, but we can look forward to it with some confidence. 'We know on the day if we get the bounce of the ball and a couple of things go our way we are good enough to compete with the top teams in the world. 'We are probably a little bit off New Zealand at the moment, but we have demonstrated with South Africa and Australia in the last couple of years it's just a case of getting over the line. 'It's just making sure that you get that elusive victory over a southern hemisphere team and then mentally it just changes that whole focus.' Mauled: Wales battle against the South African pack during the second Test in Nelspruit . Runner runner: Cornal Hendricks (right) of South Africa charges upfield with the ball in hand . The first-Test reverse at Kings Park had led to calls for a number of changes to be made in Nelspruit, but in the end Gatland chose to make only two alterations, bringing in prop Samson Lee and flanker Josh Turnbull for Adam Jones and Aaron Shingler respectively. Captain Alun-Wyn Jones felt the players had justified their coach's loyalty, and hopefully silenced their critics. 'I think there was 77 minutes and 15 seconds on the clock and we were still in the lead,' he said. 'Ultimately we can take a bit of pride out of the week as a whole, not just the performance. 'A lot of negativity, which we try to ignore, gets bounced about with social media. With stuff like that, you are never too far away from home. 'But as a collective we can be proud and, moving forward, this is not the result we would have wanted going into the off season, but definitely the performance.'","Gatland upbeat about World up preparations despite defeat .

"A radical UN recommendation to halve sugar intake will not be implemented in Britain says a Whitehall adviser on nutrition who has worked for Mars and Coca-Cola. Professor Ian MacDonald, head of a panel of health experts in charge of drawing up guidelines on sugar, said it will ‘not act’ on the World Health Organisation’s proposal. The move led to fury yesterday as senior doctors and MPs accused officials of ‘immense arrogance’ for ignoring the suggested limit of six teaspoons a day, in the face of an obesity crisis that threatens to overwhelm the NHS. Recommendations: The Government does not plan to follow advice to curb our sugar intake by half, it has emerged . And campaigners last night accused Professor MacDonald – who only recently left the pay of the two fast food giants – of being ‘in the pocket’ of the sugar industry. He is one of six scientists on the panel of eight who have links to manufacturers of sugary foods, including the world’s largest chocolate maker and fizzy drinks producers. The row comes amid growing concern over the high levels of sugar in everyday foods, which experts believe is a major contributor to obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Around a quarter of adults in Britain are obese but this is predicted to soar to more than half the population by 2050 and cost the economy £50billion a year. An average adult eats between 11 and 12  teaspoons of sugar a day – double the new recommendation – while children consume as many as 15. But referring to the WHO guidelines, Professor MacDonald said: ‘The position, I’ve been informed by the officials, is that actually we would take note of it but we would not act on it.’ He added that the Government would take the recommendations of his own panel, the Carbohydrate Working Group of the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, rather than those of the WHO. Graham MacGregor, of the group Action on Sugar and professor of cardiology at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, accused Professor MacDonald of ‘arrogance’ about the extent of the health crisis posed by sugar. He said: ‘To say that he is going to ignore the WHO has an immense amount of arrogance about it. 'Given the fact we are facing an obesity crisis, what is his plan? … it’s a real timebomb. 'Obesity and diabetes are going to overwhelm the health service in terms of cost. We have to do something.’ Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘Ian MacDonald is a leading figure in his discipline. 'The problem is his research money is so dependent on these firms that you have to ask the question, is he in their pocket?’ Luciana Berger MP, Labour’s shadow public health minister, accused the Government of being ‘too close to big businesses to do what’s best for our nation’s health’. The SACN is expected to produce its own sugar guidelines in June. The revelation has been hit by outrage from critics claiming the Government is too close to big businesses . An earlier version of this article stated that Professor Ian Young had received funding from Sugar Nutrition UK. In fact, Professor Young received funding in the years up to and including 2008 from the Sugar Bureau, which renamed itself as Sugar Nutrition UK in January 2012. We are happy to make clear that Professor Young did not receive funding from the Sugar Bureau or Sugar Nutrition UK after 2008.","World Health Organisation urging adults and children to half sugar intake .

An 11-year-old internationally ranked chess player was shot dead by his father before he turned the rifle on himself . Scotch Plains police found the bodies of 48-year-old Jens Elberling and his 11-year-old son on Saturday morning . Acting Union County Prosecutor Grace Park says an investigation has concluded that Mr Elberling shot his son late last week and then killed himself. Mr Elberling's wife Kate Chou filed for divorce from in May, though the divorce had not yet been granted, according to public records, reported NJ.com. Today Joan DuBois, director of affiliate relations for the United States Chess Federation confirmed that Thomas was an expert-level player, who was ranked fifth in his age group in the country, reported the website. Internationally, Thomas Elberling was recognized as a 'candidate master,' the final level before master player, Mr DuBois said. 'He was a very, very good player,' Mr DuBois said. Jim West, a local master-level player, who played against Thomas said: 'He was one of the most talented kids in the country,' West said. 'I'm in complete and utter shock. 'His father was very supportive of him. Why would he do this?' Officers had gone there after a request by a relative - a rifle was found in the home and there was no sign of forced entry . Mr West said Mr Elberling also never allowed anyone to take photos of his son. 'If you tried, he'd want you to delete it immediately,' he said. Other chess players said Mr Elberling was very involved in his son's games and would often ask for the air conditioning to be turned down if he was worried his son would be cold. Mr Elberling began renting the house down the street from neighbor John Crissom about a month ago. 'It's so sad - you don't want to see anyone lose their life, but an 11-year-old just starting his life, you know?' Mr Crissom said. The prosecutor's office says the boy did not attend local schools,and was instead homeschooled.","Jens Elberling, 48, shot his son, Thomas and then turned the rifle on himself .

"After vacationing at the $2,500 a night Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo this weekend, no wonder Barack and Michelle Obama look pleased with themselves as they returned to Washington on Sunday afternoon. Appearing relaxed after his third vacation of the year, the president has been heavily criticized for his taxpayer-funded trip as the crisis in Ukraine rumbles on. Squeezing in another round of golf on Sunday, the president's holiday coincided with his Vice President Joe Biden jetting off to the Virgin Islands for the weekend as the White House prepares to welcome Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk for critical talks after Russia's incursion into the Crimea. Happy: President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama board Air Force One before their departure at Homestead Air Reserve Base, on Sunday, March 9, 2014, in Homestead, Florida after their weekend vacation . The White House had previously brushed away concerns that this was not the best time for the president to jet south to play golf. White House spokesman Josh Earnest acknowledged this earlier last week and said 'there's always a chance' Obama could cut a trip short and return to Washington, but of this was not necessary. 'The fact of the matter is what the president is doing this weekend in Florida is essentially what the president would be doing if he stayed back at the White House,' Earnest told reporters traveling with Obama. The president, he said, was looking forward to 'getting a little bit of downtime in the warm weather with his wife and daughters.' Relaxed: President Barack Obama waves as he walks across the tarmac with first lady Michelle Obama before their departure on Air Force One at Homestead Air Reserve Base, on Sunday, March 9, 2014, in Homestead, Florida . Vacation: President Barack Obama arrives with first lady Michelle Obama on Marine One helicopter before their departure after spending the weekend in Florida . Obama's vacation at a private club on one of the islands off Florida's southern tip was tacked onto an afternoon visit by the president and his wife, Michelle, to a Miami high school to announce new Education Department initiatives to help more students complete the paperwork needed to qualify for federal financial aid or student loans. Every president gets criticized for the amount of time he spends away from the White House, and Obama is no different. Paul C. Light, who teaches public service at New York University, said Obama would have been wise to remain in Washington. Being in Florida with a still-fluid situation in Ukraine 'makes the president look less interested in the issue than he clearly is,' Light said. 'It's just very bad optics.' Goodbye and thanks Florida: President Barack Obama, right, and first lady Michelle Obama wave before their departure on Air Force One . Home: Marine One carrying US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama comes in to land on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington on March 9, 2014 as they return from a weekend in Florida . Obama departed the White House one day after moving to levy financial sanctions and travel bans against those the U.S. accuses of threatening Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial borders. Officials in Crimea, a pro-Russian area of Ukraine, plan to hold a referendum March 16 to decide whether to become part of Russia. Obama and Biden's decision to continue with their weekend vacation plans appeared to be an indication that the White House did not expect any quick resolution to the dispute. Nevertheless, the White House made clear that Obama is staying on top of developments in Ukraine, noting that the president called German Chancellor Angela Merkel after arriving in Key Largo. Merkel has been cautious about imposing sanctions on Russia. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama walk across the South Lawn of the White House from Marine One, Sunday, March 9, 2014, in Washington, as they arrive from Florida . The White House says Obama squeezed in another round of golf Sunday on one of the courses at the exclusive Ocean Reef Club on Key Largo, where the family was staying . The Obama family vacation comes just a few weeks after the president's long weekend at the Sunnylands estate in Rancho Mirage, California. Obama had gone to Sunnylands to meet with King Abdullah II of Jordan. He stayed behind with a gaggle of childhood friends to play golf on the desert property's nine-hole course and on a private, 19-hole course elsewhere in the city that is owned by supporter Larry Ellison, co-founder of the Oracle software company and one of the richest men in America. Obama will have plenty of opportunities to play golf this weekend, too. He checked his family into the Ocean Reef Club, a private, by-invitation-only membership club that is more of a gated, self-contained community sprawled across 2,500 acres on the northern edge of Key Largo. Exclusive: The Obamas are spending a weekend at the Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo . Paradise: The resort has two golf courses, a lagoon and a spa . The property has two championship golf courses. There's also a swimming lagoon, tennis courts, a spa and fitness center, shopping and more than a dozen restaurants among the club's varied offerings. Accommodation costs up to $2,500 per night. Obama flew by helicopter from Miami over the sun-kissed, blue waters of Florida Bay to arrive at the club's private airport. Scores of people apparently had driven their golf carts over to witness the arrival. The Republican National Committee used Obama's vacation to draw a contrast with Americans still grappling with a sluggish economy. Enlarge .

"The Django Unchained actress who claimed she was harassed by LAPD officers who unfairly arrested her when she was making out with her boyfriend appears to have been doing a lot more than just kissing. Pictures obtained by TMZ show Daniele Watts straddling her boyfriend Brian James Lucas in his car while the couple steady themselves with their hands on the car sunroof. Eyewitness accounts suggest that Watts was grinding on top of her boyfriend with  her shirt pulled up and her breasts exposed. An eyewitness who saw the couple as he worked in a nearby office told TMZ that Lucas was sitting in the passenger seat with his feet on the curb and Watts was straddling him and rocking back and forth. Scroll down for videos . Pictures obtained by TMZ show Daniele Watts straddling her boyfriend Brian James Lucas in his car while the couple steady themselves with their hands on the car sunroof . An eyewitness in a nearby offfice building said Lucas was sitting in the passenger seat with his feet on the curb and Watts was straddling him and rocking back and forth . Eyewitness accounts suggest  Watts was grinding on top of Lucas with her shirt pulled up and her breasts exposed . Someone from the office went down and asked the couple to stop because everyone in the office could see them but they continued. The eyewitnesses said Lucas then began 'horizontally bongoing her boobs back and forth'. He added that Watts eventually reached into the center console, grabbed a tissue, wiped him down and then herself and tossed it on the grass. Watts has insisted that she did nothing wrong before officers questioned and detained her - despite accounts from witnesses saying she and her partner were having sex in public. She claimed she was 'handcuffed and detained' by police after being mistaken for a prostitute as she kissed her white husband. Meanwhile the Los Angeles police officer who detained her has spoken out to defend his actions and said he never suspected her of being a prostitute. Sergeant Jim Parker told the Los Angeles Times that he never intended to arrest Watts or her boyfriend Brian James Lucas when he was called to an LA studio parking lot for a report of two people have sex in a car. Watts has insisted that she did nothing wrong before officers questioned and detained her - despite accounts from witnesses saying she and her partner were having sex in public . The actress claimed she was 'handcuffed and detained' by police after being mistaken for a prostitute . 'I figured I could take care of this call and go get coffee and that was it,' Sgt Parker told the newspaper. Instead, he says, Watts turned it into a 'long, drawn-out drama.' 'I was trying to ID them and leave. Nobody wanted them arrested for having sex in public,' Sgt Parker told the Times. 'But then she went into her tirade.' In a police audio of the incident obtained by TMZ, Daniele Watts is heard accusing the police of racism when Sgt. Jim Parker asks her for ID. She then tells cops that they don't who she is before storming off, refusing to show her ID. Watts (right) insisted she was just kissing her boyfriend in the car but witness accounts suggest different . After storming off, Watts was apprehended by a police officer a short distance away and brought back where she continued her rant. In the audio, Sgt. Parker can be heard telling Watts that the police were responding to calls from a nearby office. She says: 'I bet there's at least one person up there who's a racist. I bet you. I bet you're a little bit racist.' After refusing to give her name, Watts demands to know Sgt. Parker’s first name, before adding: ‘I think I’d like to identify you to my publicist. What’s your first name?’ She continues: 'I guess we all have our destinies... I serve freedom and love. You guys serve detainment. That's cool. 'I hope you feel free... I hope when you're f***ing your spouses you really feel alive. That you feel thankful, full of gratitude for the freedom that you have, that you share with the people of this country.' Watts was stopped by police in Los Angeles last week after she was reported for kissing her boyfriend Brian Lucas (left). She claims police thought she was a prostitute . The actress played the role of house slave Coco Quentin Tarantino's 2012 film Django Unchained . Miss Watts told CNN that she stands by her decision not handing over her ID. 'I believe what this country stands for and I believe in freedom and I believe in a country that calls itself the land of the free and the home of the brave,' she said on Monday. 'If I am within my amendment rights, my constitutional rights to say no, unless you're charging me with a crime, I will not be giving you my ID, that is a right that I stand up for.' California law allows police to handcuff and detain people in order to identify them. The LAPD says it is conducting a review of the incident. The department is also investigating a complaint Miss Watts filed against Sgt Parker. A recording of the encounter, obtained by the TMZ and the Times, shows Parker explaining: 'Somebody called, which gives me the right to be here, so it gives me the right to identify you by law.' Watts responds: 'Do you know how many times I've been called, the cops have been called just for being black? Just because we're black and he's white? I'm just being really honest, sir.' Sgt Parker replies: 'Who brought up the race card?'","Pictures  show Daniele Watts straddling boyfriend Brian James Lucas in car .

"QPR chairman Tony Fernandes took to Twitter to give his backing to under-fire boss Harry Redknapp on Saturday while revealing it was the Rangers boss and not him who paid the bill when the pair went for dinner on Friday night. Redknapp, who maintains he feels under no pressure whatsoever despite the R's languishing at the bottom of the Premier League, suggested it would be Fernandes sorting out the bill during his pre-match press conference ahead of their meeting with Liverpool.

"A frail Joan Rivers gave what appears to be her final press interview just days before she was rushed to hospital suffering cardiac arrest, speaking of her long history with doctors, her fear of losing her voice and how her inevitable death would come as a 'big blow' to her daughter, Melissa. The irrepressible comedian sat down with The Sunday Times magazine from her daughters home in Los Angeles shortly before returning to her home in New York and undergoing routine throat surgery, in a procedure that would leave her on life support. Times journalist Camilla Long writes that the 81-year-old 'has practically no voice when we meet: just a tiny, scratchy, drawl'. Rivers, long a pioneer of plastic surgery, said her focus was no longer cosmetic enhancements but ways in which she keep her tired voice box from carrying on. Scroll down for video . Last words: The final interview Joan Rivers conducted before her death on September 4 gives insight into her dealings with doctors, her obsession with her voice and her relationship with her daughter . Of her countless encounters with doctors, she spoke of enjoying the 'auditioning' process when it came to those operating on her. She said she would 'ask them everything' and hound them with questions. Rivers said she was particularly weary of anesthesiologists. She would ask: 'Who are you and when did you last have a glass of wine?' On August 28, Rivers stopped breathing during a procedure on her vocal cords at a clinic on Manhattan's Upper East Side. She was rushed to Mount Sinai and places in a medically induced coma after suffering cardiac arrest. Rivers was then moved onto life life support. On September 4 the family announced she had died. The veteran comic - who was known, in her later years, to cry very easily - appeared worried about the effect her death would have on daughter Melissa, her only child with husband Edgar Rosenberg, who committed suicide in 1987. Ominously, Rivers said her death would come as a 'big blow' to Melissa. 'Melissa says, ''I don’t want to hear about it, I don’t want to talk about it’', but I say, it’s comi-i-i-ing!' Rivers told The Times magazine. 'It’s inevitable. It’s no longer an abstract thing. 'It’s like, God, I’m in my eighties. 'Nobody, when I die, is going to say, “how young?” 'They’re going to say, she had a great ride.' 'Big blow': Rivers, 81, said she worried about the effect her death was going to have on her daughter Melissa just days before she died . While often somber, the interview piece still contains plenty of the biting wit Rivers was legendary for. Notably old-fashioned, she particularly took aim at the modern man. 'Men don’t stand up when you come into the room,' she raged. 'I go onto a plane and no one helps me to put my bags overhead. 'I’m an old woman! Plus a celebrity!' She also said women should think twice before moving with a man when they are not married. '(There are) no rules, no consequences. 'I think it’s a pity girls live with men in the hope that one day they’ll marry them.' Rivers was laid to rest Sunday at Temple Emanu-El, a Jewish Synagogue just a few blocks from her apartment in Manhattan.","Last interview conducted  in Los Angeles by The Sunday Times .

"The Financial Fair Play battleground in the Premier League is likely to become considerably more messy after a special summit at UEFA’s headquarters in Nyon on Monday. Clubs with huge debts, such as Manchester United, might find themselves under the microscope during the next stage of FFP, which is due to be discussed at the meeting. UEFA president Michel Platini has gathered all those involved in FFP — including Manchester City, who have had £50m worth of sanctions imposed for their overspending — to talk about how to refine the controversial legislation. In-debt Manchester United spent heavily over the summer on players such as Angel Di Maria (right) UEFA chief Gianni Infantino has confirmed that the issue of debt is expected to be raised again . UEFA chief executive Gianni Infantino confirmed at Leaders in Sport that the debt issue may be on the agenda next week and the European Clubs Association also say they expect it to be raised. City will stress their zero-debt status and push the case for sustainable investment spending rather than try to shift the spotlight on to their Manchester neighbours, who still owe £350m from the Glazer family’s leveraged purchase of the club. Nevertheless City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak did highlight the differences between the two clubs when he pointedly said: ‘We have a sustainable project. We have zero debt. We don’t pay a penny to service any debt.’ Like our Manchester United Facebook page. Malcolm Glazer first bought a stake in Manchester United in 2003. He and his family continued to buy them until 2005, when they launched a successful £800million takeover of the club. Most of their capital came in the form of loans, which were secured against the club's assets, meaning United were liable for the interest payments. Despite being one of the most profitable clubs on earth, they are still hundreds of millions of pounds in debt. Disgruntled supporters set up FC United of Manchester in 2005 in protest at the Glazers' ownership. The Green and Gold campaign was also a high-profile protest movement.

"This is the dramatic moment a brave jeweller confronted armed bandits and booted them out of his shop - giving one a kick in the bottom for good measure.

A spokesman added: 'It was a very brave reaction by the shopkeeper - not something we would recommend to anyone else caught up in similar circumstances.

"What started as an April fool’s joke by an American brewery has resulted in the production of a rather unique new type of beer, made using bulls' testicles. The Wynkoop Brewing Company in Denver produced a spoof video touting the daring ingredient in a fake product called Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout last April as a publicity stunt for April fool’s day. Despite the video containing some fairly tongue-in-cheek lines it seems the joke was lost on many and the company was inundated with requests for samples of the special beer. Scroll down for video . Turning a joke into reality: The beer is made of hops, gains, water and fresh bull's testicles . Farm fresh: The Rocky Mountain Oysters are added whole into the kettle to give the full 'flavour and nuances into the beer' ‘When we sent out the press release and the video link last April, we heard from brewers and beer writers who thought the beer was for real and loved the idea. They wanted samples. So did many patrons who came to the pub to try the beer. So we’ve turned our joke into a reality.’ The first eight barrels were made for the Great American Beer Festival, held in Denver later this month, and contains a massive 11kg of bull testicles, all lovingly sliced and roasted by Wynkoop sous chef Andrew Langlo. The April fool’s video features head brewer Andy Brown praising the Wynkoop’s tradition of ‘trailblazing’ in the field and sourcing new ingredients, especially those with a ‘strong regional flavor.’ Trailblazing: The Wynkoop Brewing Company is based in Denver and will premier their new product at the Great American Beer Festival later this month . The magic ingredient: The testicles are from free range Colorado cattle and are described as 'really fresh' A brewer then explains: ‘Fried bull testicles or Rocky Mountain Oysters are a Colorado favorite. ‘This . makes them the perfect ingredient to showcase in a new style of beer . we’ve created, which really pays tribute to one of Colorado’s unique . culinary jewels.’ A voice over lists the ingredients as organic Colorado Malts, hops, Rocky Mountain water, and bull testicles from free range Colorado cattle. ‘We’re adding the Rocky Mountain Oysters whole into the kettle to give the full flavour and nuances into the beer . ‘When making this style of beer it’s important to use the freshest ingredients possible, and these testicles… they’re very fresh.’ Keeping it local: Head brewer Andy Brown argues the testicles have a 'strong regional flavor' The result of our efforts is a luscious creamy stout that delivers loads of flavor, everything from roasted barley and coffee, to chocolate...and nuts’ The video ends by informing customers that there is a limit of two cans per head, presumably to prevent a wave of bulk buying on the part of enthusiastic, and daring, drinkers.

"The Welsh Rugby Union are in fantasy land at the start of 2014, with their domestic game crumbling in front of them. The union’s conduct in the bitter conflict with the regions amounts to a dereliction of duty and an act of wanton vandalism. When Regional Rugby Wales confirmed on New Year’s Eve that they would not sign a new participation agreement, it was an understandable stance given the lack of clarity about so many details. Fantasy land: The WRU - based at the Millennium Stadium (above) - are playing hardball with the regons . Yet, the WRU’s response was extraordinary – hinting that they are ready to cut the Blues, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets adrift, and create new professional teams. It is the latest example of gun-boat diplomacy in a turbulent season for European rugby. The regions are culpable to an extent, in failing to establish a firm basis for sustainable businesses and being over-reliant on central funding. However, the four teams have produced a stream of talented players for Wales and the WRU’s reaction now is a power-play that could drive the regions to oblivion. Yet, their alternative vision is ludicrously far-fetched. After a meeting of the union’s board on Thursday, it was announced that they will soon present the regions with a new draft agreement, understood to contain a tiered payment scheme based on the creation and retention of Test players. But, if this ploy fails, it is thought that the WRU’s fall-back plan is to create new professional teams, potentially based in Neath, Pontypridd, Colwyn Bay and at the Millennium Stadium. This sporting miracle must take place in six months, to support the WRU pledge to ensure Welsh sides continue to participate in the Pro 12 and European tournaments. All they have to do is rustle up 120-150 players capable of competing at that level, four bona fide coaching line-ups, back-room staff, officials, sponsors, suppliers… oh, and crowds. No chance. All the indications are that the Welsh public will view any such teams as unwelcome imposters and will greet them with hostility and indifference. Meanwhile, the existing regions will be barred by the WRU from forming a break-away Anglo-Welsh league. All the top stars coming out of contract will join the exodus abroad and hordes of gifted players will be left in career limbo. The new sides will be routed week after week in front of empty stands and without local heroes to inspire them, the nation’s gaze will be drawn even more emphatically to football, probably never to return. That is the reality of the WRU’s fantasy vision. Last week, this column lamented the steady erosion of club loyalty in the game, so how fitting that there should be an immediate antidote to such a doomsday perspective. While Gloucester are resigned to losing Freddie Burns to Leicester, they confirmed on Thursday that their veteran wing, James Simpson-Daniel, has agreed a new contract to continue his 13-year association with the West Country club. New deal: Simpson-Daniel (right) earned 10 caps for England from 2002 to 2008 . ‘Sinbad’ has been one of the finest attacking players of the era at club level, even if an endless catalogue of injuries have cruelly undermined his England career. He is currently recovering from a fracture-dislocation of the left ankle and all those who revel in the sight of a free-spirit flier carving up defences will await his next comeback with great anticipation. Tip-tackle rulings make no sense . Apologies for returning to a well-worn gripe, but officiating of tip-tackles has become a blight on the game and Harlequins’ Big Game against Exeter provided fresh evidence of a lack of commonsense. First, Matt Hopper picked up Jason Shoemark and dropped him on his back, but avoided a card despite conceding a penalty. Later, Jack Nowell lifted Hopper’s legs above the level of his head, but then recognised the danger and lowered his legs down carefully, while the Quins centre used an arm to cushion his fall. Sin-binned: Nowell (right) had a right to feel aggrieved for his yellow card against Quins at Twickenham . Yet, the Exeter wing received a yellow card for his actions, and he wasn’t the only one to be stunned by the decision. There MUST be common sense applied, rather than a one-size-fits-all formula. Legs being raised above a 90-degree angle shouldn’t be an automatic trigger for disciplinary action, provided what follows is safe. A ball-carrier whose legs are lifted 95 degrees then lowered carefully is surely less at risk than one whose legs don’t quite reach the horizontal, but is then dropped on to their spine. Events on of New Year’s Day must surely have dismissed any lingering doubts about the wisdom of more so-called ‘plastic’ pitches being installed at club grounds – and at Test arenas too. The Pro12 League witnessed a tale of two surfaces amid a wet festive period, as Cardiff Blues’ game against the Dragons went ahead, while Glasgow’s clash with Edinburgh was cancelled at short notice. The pitch at Scotstoun couldn’t cope with the monsoon, but that wasn’t a problem in the Welsh capital, now that the Arms Park has a state-of-the-art, 4G synthetic surface. Making a splash: Glasgow Warriors duo Ruaridh Jackson (left) and Stuart Hogg slide in the flooded Scotsoun pitch after their match against Edinburgh was called off due to a waterlogged pitch . Water performance: The BLues v Dragons clash went ahead on the artificial Arms Park surface . It cost £400,000 to install but it is money well spent – with the Blues and the community already enjoying the benefits. The same can be said of Saracens, who started the trend at their Allianz Park ground. After several recent Tests were disrupted by mud and torn turf, the artificial option should be embraced urgently. Yet, there is a reluctance to go down the synthetic route at the Millennium Stadium because officials there want to bring the Champions League Final to Cardiff and to do so; they must provide a grass pitch. The last word... The RFU are investigating Richard Cockerill’s comments after the Leicester v Sale match last Saturday and the Tigers’ director of rugby faces the threat of a disrepute charge. He has also faced fierce criticism in some quarters, but not here. He accused Sale of setting out to ‘cheat, cheat and cheat again’ in the scrum and in response, his counterpart from the Cheshire club, Steve Diamond, insinuated that Leicester break the salary cap. War of words: Leicester chief Richard Cockerill (left) and his Sale counterpart Steve Diamond (right) Despite that claim being denied by the Tigers, Diamond later repeated it. The match has generated a classic ‘war of words’, which in turn generates tribal rivalry, passion and coverage, so where’s the harm? Both Cockerill and Diamond should have every right to speak their mind honestly. Such sparring between coaches brings straight-talking colour to a game increasingly dominated by bland platitudes. Every opposition is lethal, every defeat is a vital lesson with ‘positives’, every controversy prompts treading on egg-shells. To hell with all that, let’s have more shooting from the hip to enliven proceedings. Even negative comments about referees should be permissible providing they are qualified, rather than just a scatter-gun attempt to deflect blame.","Welsh regions in dispute with WRU over proposed Anglo-Welsh league .

"Standing tall: Neil Fingleton, who is 7ft, 7in, towers over Emma Cannon who plays Maid Marion in the Robin Hood production. A festive pantomime production of Robin Hood is expected to truly hit the heights this Christmas, after casting Britain's tallest man in one of the leading roles. Actor Neil Fingleton, who stands at 7ft 5in, will play Little John at the Bradford Alhambra Theatre production over the festive period. Britain's tallest man and the world's tallest actor, who wears size 15 shoes and has a 54-inch inside leg, has had his costumes specially-designed to fit his giant frame. Mr Fingleton, 30, from Durham, went into acting after a back injury halted his basketball career, and he has recently completed filming of movie with Keanu Reeves. Extreme height runs in his family - Mr Fingleton's brother is 6ft 10in, his sister is 6ft 3in and his great grandfather was 6ft 8in. Mr Fingleton has been featured in documentaries about his height, has appeared in several advertising campaigns for international brands . Speaking about his acting career on the Guinness World Records website, he said: 'I have never been self conscious about my height. 'I am more conscious of going bald so that should tell you. I never let my height play a negative part in my life. 'I always do what I want, some tall people may be restricted as they are constantly stared at or people ask the same questions over and over. 'This is the only bad thing about being tall – the stupid remarks and questions. Other than that, being tall is great. 'I have been doing acting work since my basketball career finished. I spent 8 years in the USA attending High School and College. I graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in 2004 with a degree in History. I have played professionally in Greece, Italy, Spain. Now I am concentrating on acting and trying to move to LA soon to jump in with both feet so to speak.' The theatre are employing an array of special effects in the Robin Hood production featuring Britain's tallest man. Effects will include an animatronic smoke-breathing dragon with a five-metre wing-span, which will fly over the audience, and an on-stage rainfall and enchanted waterfall which will answer questions by spelling out words. Mr Fingleton, who has recently worked with on a film with Keanu Reeves, originally planned a basketball career before going in to acting due to a back injury .","Britain's tallest man is also world's tallest actor .

"A couple of fumbling Florida fugitives led police on a wild river chase as they tried to escape from the cops by paddling away in a canoe. The hapless pair  tried to flee cops by floating their way to freedom down the Withlacoochee River. They almost got away with it were it not for a police power boat that caught up with the dumb duo some nine miles downstream. The paddlers were nabbed and brought back to dry land where they were placed into police custody. Fugitives: Garrett Eure, and Jessie Bryant, both 23, attempted to flee cops by floating their way to freedom . You too: Cassandra Zabriskie, 21, Eure's girlfriend was also arrested . Garrett Eure, 23, of Gainesville, was wanted for failure to appear on an escape charge and the other fugitive was Jessie Bryant, 23, of Fort Pierce, who was wanted on various charges. For a time,the fugitives managed to elude authorities for about five hours as they used wooden paddles to sail down the river for nine miles. The U.S. Marshals Service contacted the Madison County Sheriff’s Office on Monday to say that Eure was living in Madison. Investigators determined that Eure was living in a house in Lee with Bryant, who was wanted in St. Lucie County for charges of armed burglary coupled with assault and battery by strangulation. A couple of floaters: The pair got nine miles down the Withlacoochee River . Dumb couple: Garrett Eure, 23 and his girlfriend Cassandra Zabriskie, 21, also of Gainesville were both arrested. She was released on bail whilst Euro is being held on $100,000 bond . Bryant was arrested on warrants for burglary and battery. Zabriskie was also arrested on charges of resisting arrest without violence. Eure’s girlfriend, Cassandra Zabriskie, 21, also of Gainesville, was with them. Eure and Bryant suspected that authorities had found them and they ran to the Withlacoochee River, climbed into a canoe and tried to escape. Officials used dogs to track the fugitives on foot and then started up a motorboat to chase them on the river. The small blue canoe the men used was filled with a cooler and several backpacks, said Russell Williams, a freelance photographer who was present during the arrests. As dumb as each other: The two fugitives Garrett Eure, 23, were living with his girlfriend, Cassandra Zabriskie,21, pictured here . Getaway vehicle: The two men tried to run, or rather, paddle from the law in a two-man canoe. The police soon caught up with them nine miles down the river . Mr Williams added that deputies at the scene said they had been to Zabriskie’s house multiple times, and she had told them her boyfriend was not there. According to Florida Department of Corrections records, Eure was in prison until October 2013 on several Lake County charges, including armed burglary and grand theft. Both men have quite the wrap sheet. In March 2013, the Gainesville Police Department arrested Eure for escaping while on work release and returned him to state custody. Bryant meanwhile, was incarcerated from 2009 to 2012 on charges out of St. Lucie County, including burglary, credit card fraud, organized fraud, fleeing a law enforcement officer and grand theft of a motor vehicle. The three were taken into custody by deputies and taken to the Madison County jail. Zabriskie was released on $540 bond on Monday night, but Bryant and Eure remained at the jail on Tuesday on no bond and $100,000 bond respectively.","Undynamic duo thought they would float their way to freedom down a nearby river .

"With four excited little girls under two, Sean and Lisa Kelly are expecting Christmas Day to be rather hectic. But the couple plan to make the most of every moment. Their quads – the first ever born in Britain who are two sets of identical twins – are the children they thought they’d never have. Lined up for the camera: Mother Lisa used all her tricks to get (l-r) Annabelle, Hannah, Jessica and Heidi . The two pairs, Hannah and Jessica, and Annabelle and Heidi, were conceived during a third attempt at IVF and, growing from two implanted embryos, were born at odds of ten million to one on December 27, 2009. ‘I feel lucky every time I look at them,’ said Mrs Kelly, 36. ‘But Christmas is particularly emotional – this time two years ago I was pregnant and had no idea if they’d survive.’ Mrs Kelly, of Billingham, Cleveland, who also has a ten-year-old son Cameron, admits she struggles to tell the girls apart, relying on their temperaments and, in one case, a freckle to identify them. Here, using all her tricks, she got them in order for a Christmas photo, from left: Annabelle, Hannah, Jessica and Heidi. Yet originally Mrs Kelly and her husband, 37, an electrical designer, from Billingham, Cleveland, had simply wanted a sibling for their son Cameron, now 10. After failing to conceive naturally a second time, they spent £9,000 savings on fertility treatment and were shocked when doctors broke the news they were expecting quads. Says Mrs Kelly: “Two embryos had been placed back into my uterus but everyone was stunned when both of them grew into two sets of identical twins. Even doctors couldn’t believe it.’ But their joy was tainted when doctors explained quadruplet pregnancies are very rare and potentially very dangerous. Happy family: The four girls sit happily with their mother Lisa and father Sean, with brother Cameron, 10, making the family complete . Despite all the odds, however, after a problem-free pregnancy the girls, born at 31.5 weeks were healthy.  Identical twins Heidi and Annabelle each weighed 3Ib 3oz while twins Hannah and Jessica, who are also identical, weighed 2Ib 11oz and 2Ib 10oz respectively. And now all of the girls are walking, talking and climbing – and they’re developing their own individual little personalities. Explains their mum: ‘Heidi is the most dominant and probably the naughtiest as she is always up to something and her twin, Annabelle is very placid. ‘Sean and I can’t tell Jessica and Hannah apart just by looking at them – so Hannah, whose only difference is a freckle behind her left knee  - wears a bracelet. But Jessica is super lively and always on the go while Hannah is more timid and loves sitting on my knee.’ On a normal day their mother, who fits part time work around her husband, goes through 20 nappies, two packs of wet wipes, eight pints of milk, 2Ib of potatoes, puts on four loads of washing and does several hours of tumble drying. She says: “We’re on our second washing machine and tumble drier in less than two years. And I shop every other day for food – my bill comes to around £200 a week.’ A usual day in the Kelly household begins around 5.30am when the girls – who each share a room with their twin at the family’s four-bed detached house – wake up. Says Mrs Kelly: ‘Sean and I give them their bottles. Then an hour later we put up four high chairs and give each of them their bowls of cereal. After that it’s upstairs to get dressed – which can be quite difficult with four wriggling toddlers.’ Christmas miracles: The girls pictured at just five days old, shortly after they were born as the first set of quads in Britain including two sets of identical twins . The couple cook all the family meals from scratch. She says: ‘It would be easy to give them fish fingers and chicken nuggets but we manage by bulk cooking. So we might make several shepherd’s pies in one go and freeze them.’ And she manages their wardrobe by buying identical outfits – although buying the same for four children means a dress, cardigan, tights and shoes for all of them often tops £150 a shop. She explains: ‘I do feel very proud seeing them all dressed in the same little outfits. But mostly going to the park is much easier if they are all dressed in the same clothes. For example, they all have a bright pink coat on with ducks and when I round them up I just have to search for the bright pink toddlers.  Needless to say though, I try to avoid buying any clothes that need ironing…’ Meanwhile, the family also possesses a quad buggy with two seats in two rows from America, which just about fits into their Espace car. She says: ‘We do take the girls on holiday – earlier this year we went to Centre Parcs but we always travel at night as the girls can be quite noisy and it’s much more peaceful when they’re all asleep.’ In the evening, baths are taken in twos with the girls going to bed around 6.45. ‘Sean and I often don’t eat until 9.30pm ,’ she sighs, ‘it is tiring because obviously we are also busy with Cameron taking him to friends and after-school events. ‘But despite that, we adore having a big family.  And I only have to see the girls in their cots asleep looking like little angels to forget even the busiest and most fraught days.’","Twins were conceived during third IVF attempt, growing from two implanted embryos .

"Police are prepared to use plastic bullets for the first time on the British mainland if student protests planned for tomorrow erupt into violence. Scotland Yard revealed yesterday that the baton rounds have been authorised for a student fees march in London amid fears it could be hijacked by anarchists and troublemakers. Baton gun rounds have never been used on the British mainland, but they have been linked to deaths in Northern Ireland. Scotland Yard has refused to say where and when the bullets (pictured) would have been deployed . Officers stressed yesterday that they were not planning to use baton rounds and they would only be a last resort if all other tactics had failed and officers’ lives were at risk. Commander Simon Pountain says 4,000 officers will be on the street on Wednesday . Commander Simon Pountain, who is in charge of the police operation, said armoured vehicles, known as Jankels, would also be on standby if the protests saw a repeat of this summer riots or the chaos last year during the student fees demonstrations. Baton rounds were pre-authorised during August’s riots but were not used. This is the first time they have been pre-authorised for a planned protest march on the mainland. The march, organised by the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts, is due to go from Bloomsbury in Central London to the City. It is being kept away from the St Paul’s anti-capitalism protest but activists from the cathedral camp are expected to join in. Last year, the then Met Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson was criticised for only sending out 225 officers who were overwhelmed by hordes of rampaging student protesters smashing into the Conservative Party headquarters on November 10. And on December 9, during another student protest, Prince Charles’s limousine was besieged in the worst royal security breach in a decade. The Duchess of Cornwall’s face was a mask of terror as rioters swarmed around their Rolls-Royce Phantom VI, kicking, hitting and rocking the car. One managed to poke her with a stick through a window. Demonstrators at Millbank Tower, in Westminster, central London, last year. Hundreds of arrests were made and buildings damaged following disorder . By contrast, more than 4,000 police will oversee tomorrow’s march, which is expected to attract crowds of 10,000. Police leave has been cancelled and 550 officers have drafted in from outside forces in. Mr Pountain said baton rounds and Jankels would be available in reserve after the latter proved effective when they were brought in to push back rioters in Clapham and Hackney in August. ‘I would not be putting baton rounds on the streets but I have asked for them to be available,’ he said. Jenny Jones, a Green Party member of the Metropolitan Police Authority and London Mayoral candidate reacted with horror. ‘Any officer that shoots a student with a baton round will have to answer to the whole of London,’ she said.","Rubber bullets will be used to protect officers being attacked .

It's one thing hitting someone in the face. ‘But to use a bottle on someone you don't know is just outrageous. ‘It just scares me that girls are capable of doing that.’ Sometime between 1.30am and 2.30am, Amy and two other friends decided to leave the VIP area and head to the main dance floor and ran into the trio of attack suspects. Amy said: ‘Some girls started pushing into us but we just ignored them at first. ‘We were still dancing and then one of my friends got a drink poured on her. ‘She said something to the girls and then it all kicked off. ‘I felt something hit the back of my head, and when I turned around I was hit twice in the face with a bottle and I was dragged to the floor.’ The second blow caused the glass to break and club doormen came to help her as blood ran from the wound on her face. Amy said: ‘I grabbed my face and realised it was bleeding. I was covered in blood and I was hysterical and panicking. ‘It was just horrendous.’ Amy was taken to hospital and had five stitches to close a deep cut above her eye. She also suffered cuts to her mouth and bruising to her face. ‘I was so lucky,’ she said. ‘If the glass had hit one centimetre lower it would have been in my eye.’ Det Cons Andy Kelsall, of Northumbria Police's Newcastle Central CID, is now urging the public to help trace the violent clubbers. He said: ‘We're continuing to investigate this assault, which left a woman with an injury to her face which required hospital treatment.’ Anyone who recognises the girls pictured should call Northumbria police on 0345 604 3043 ext 69191.

"The Penn State assistant coach placed on what the university calls 'administrative leave', has told football players in a brief conference call that his career as their coach is over. Wide receivers coach Mike McQuery, who witnessed Jerry Sandusky raping a 10-year-old boy in the shower room in 2002 but did not intervene, according to a grand jury indictment, also stunned the students by telling them he was in 'protective custody' at a location away from campus. The university has already banned McQuery from today's game against Nebraska at the Beaver Stadium for his own safety, but the comment appears to have been an attempt at black humour which fell on deaf ears. Some players believed him to be telling the truth, the Patriot-News reported. Scroll down for videos of vigil . Memorial: People gather in front of the Old Main building for a candlelight vigil on the Penn State campus on Friday . Huge turnout: A sombre mood was created as people held candles under a moonlit sky . Suspected cover-up: Assistant coach Mike McQueary (pictured with Joe Paterno), who allegedly witnessed Sandusky's rape of a young boy but did not go to the police, has told players his career is over . McQuery's predicament emerged as a nighttime vigil to honour the victims of Sandusky's alleged sexual assaults took place outside the Old Main building of Penn State's central Pennsylvania campus. It was an emotional scene, as students lit blue candles and joined together in songs which included the Alma Mater and their popular chant 'We Are'. In a drastically altered atmosphere from the riots of earlier in the week, an acapella group performed a rendition of Coldplay's 'Fix You' with many students singing along to the line 'tears stream down your face', according to university paper the Daily Collegian. Interim President Rodney Erickson, in for sacked Graham Spanier, stood on the Old Main patio during the memorial and former NFL linebacker LaVar Arrington, 33, who played for Penn State under shamed Joe Paterno before being drafted by the Washington Redskins in 2000, gave a powerful speech. Arrington said the shocking allegations were a 'wake up call' to protect one another. 'Let's make tonight the starting point of setting the standard,' he said. 'Leave here with a resolve and an understanding that you have the power to change things.' Alumnus: Former Penn State all-American and NFL player LaVar Arrington delivered a stirring speech during the vigil, organised by students to show their support for the sexual abuse victims of a former Penn State assistant football coach . Reflection: The calm scenes were in sharp contrast to the riots of Wednesday night . Together: Penn State has a game against Nebraska today and the team's popular 'We Are' chant echoed round the campus last night . Respects: People place their candles together after a candlelight vigil in front of the Old Main building on the Penn State Campus on Friday . The vigil capped off an arduous day for Penn State, which had begun with a pledge by the board of trustees to search for the truth and an announcement that McQuery had been placed on 'administrative leave'. 'It became clear that coach McQueary . could not function in this role under these circumstances,' Erickson . said on Friday of the multiple threats against the coach. The Patriot-News reported that on Friday afternoon, new receivers coach Terrell Golden gathered the players in a room at Penn State's football complex and allowed them to talk with McQueary on a speaker phone. During a brief and emotional conversation, McQueary reportedly told them: 'I wanted to let you guys know I'm not your coach anymore. I'm done.' According to the paper, when the players asked where he was or if they could see him, McQueary responded: 'No, I'm actually in protective custody. I'm not in State College.' One of the team: McQueary, who graduated from Penn State and was quarterback of a successful season during his tenure, was already banned from today's match for his own safety . Arrested: McQuery testified that he saw former Penn State football coach . Jerry Sandusky, pictured being taken into custody, sodomising a . 10-year-old boy in the showers . Sports Information Director Jeff Nelson later told the paper McQueary was not in protective custody and suggested the comment was an attempt at black humor that fell flat. The players did not get the joke and were still shaken by the comment when the call ended, the Patriot-News reported. McQueary, 37, has been a full-time coach at Penn State since 2004. He was a graduate assistant when he allegedly witnessed Sandusky sodomising a 10-year-old boy. He has been specialising as the receivers coach and recruiting coordinator and was the Nittany Lions' starting quarterback in 1997. He is married with a two-year-old daughter. Besides Paterno, Spanier and McQuery, others at the school have been accused of a cover-up of Sandusky's alleged sexual assaults of eight boys over a 15-year period. Athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz have each been charged with perjury and failing to report an incident of abuse in 2002 to authorities. Curley has taken administrative leave, while Schultz — who was already working on an interim capacity — has returned to retirement. Paterno has not been implicated, and prosecutors have said he is not a target of the investigation. Curley and Schultz, through their attorneys, have denied wrongdoing. Perjury charge: Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley, left, and VP for finance and business Gary Schultz . Described in court papers as distraught about witnessing the 2002 attack, separate newspaper accounts from the time indicate McQueary appeared in the months and years that followed in charity events that Sandusky also took part in, or were to benefit Sandusky's group The Second Mile. Asked if McQueary would be fired, Erickson said 'there are complexities to that issue that I am not prepared to go into at this point.' In forums online, and in comments on other websites, some have indeed called for McQueary to be ousted, but the assistant coach could be protected as a whistleblower. Gerald J. Williams, a partner at a Philadelphia law firm, said Pennsylvania law is broad in protecting a person who reports wrongdoing, as long as that person is part of a governmental or quasi-governmental institution, such as Penn State. Asked if McQueary was protected by whistleblower status, trustee Boyd Wolff said on Friday after a board meeting, 'He's a witness. He's different from the others, so he has to be treated differently.'. According to the grand jury report, McQueary 'reported what he had seen' to Paterno the next day, and Paterno then spoke to Curley. Now you see it, now you don't: Paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has removed its name and logo from the banner which serves as a backdrop to all press conferences on campus . McQueary was also called to a separate meeting with Curley and Schultz. Schultz, in turn, notified university president Graham Spanier. Curley and Schultz — as well as Paterno — testified they were told that Sandusky behaved inappropriately in that 2002 incident, but not to the extent of McQueary's graphic account to the grand jury. McQueary, 28 years old at the time of the incident,  was 'distraught' after witnessing the alleged 2002 assault, according to the indictment. Yet it appears he may have continued to participate in fundraising events with Sandusky — including one held less than a month later. Sandusky was arrested and charged last Saturday. His lawyer maintains his client is innocent. The financial fallout from the shocking allegations that Penn State instigated a cover-up of prolonged the sexual abuse has begun in earnest with sponsors pulling out of the university. Online automobile shopping company Cars.com has withdrawn its television sponsorship of Penn State's football game against Nebraska at Beaver Stadium today, while paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams has removed its name and logo from the banner which serves as a backdrop to all press conferences on campus.","Mike McQuery, who 'witnessed Jerry Sandusky sodomising a boy', is on 'administrative leave'

The great-grandmother has stunned family and friends by insisting she wants to continue putting in a 45-hour week despite breaking her hip last year. She has been an administrator for Portsmouth-based Storytime Nursery, run by her daughter Janet Storey, 63, for 19 years.

"Rescue divers were this morning given between 12 and 24 hours to complete their search of the stricken Costa Concordia cruise liner. Firefighters warned that time is running out as rough seas are predicted to hit the Tuscan island of Giglio later today. It prompted fears to rise that high waves could push the ship from its rocky resting place and send it plummeting 100m down to the bottom of the Mediterranean sea. Stormy weather has already postponed work to to avert a potential ecological disaster by extracting the half-million gallons of fuel on board the vessel. Scroll down for video... Search: A firefighter helicopter flies over the Costa Concordia cruise ship after it ran aground off the west coast of Italy . Scaling: Italian firefighters climb the Costa Concordia this morning as the search continues . Resuming: Divers have little time left to finish their search of the Costa Concordia before it becomes too dangerous, firefighters have warned . The warning came as the search for 21 missing people resumed and a leading maritime publication said the ship's sinking was 'not a black and white case'. It followed the discovery that Gertrud Goergens, who was initially thought to be trapped onboard, was now safe back home in Germany. Richard Meade, editor of maritime magazine Lloyd's List Intelligence, said that the tracking of the same ship's route in August showed it actually went slightly closer to Giglio than the course that caused Friday's disaster. He said: 'This is not a black-and-white case. Our data suggests that both routes took the vessel within 200 meters of the impact point and that the authorised route was actually closer to shore.' Operation: Italian divers are using explosives to get into the hull of the Costa Concordia . Dead: Hungarian violinist Sandor Feher is among the 11 confirmed victims of the Costa Concordia . Up above: The luxury cruise ship Costa Concordia is shown run aground off the coast of Giglio in this satellite photo . Eleven people have been confirmed dead so far, and 21 are missing. A Hungarian victim was identified yesterday as 38-year-old Sandor Feher, who had been working as an entertainer on the stricken cruise ship. His body was found inside the wreck and identified by his mother, who had travelled to the Italian city of Grosseto, according to Hungary's foreign ministry. Jozsef Balog, a pianist who worked with Feher on the ship, told the Blikk newspaper that Feher was wearing a lifejacket when he decided to return to his cabin to retrieve his violin. Listed: Stormy weather has already postponed work to to avert a potential ecological disaster by extracting the half-million gallons of fuel on board the vessel . Divers of the Italian paramilitary Carabinieri police are in the water yesterday close to the wrecked Costa Concordia ship . Trawling: Police scuba divers yesterday scoured the ship for survivors and bodies, using explosives to blast debris and other obstacles out of their path . A salvage company is preparing to pump more than 2,300 tonnes of fuel out from the ship's 17 tanks. Italian Environment Minister Corrado Clini said it would take 10 days to pump all the fuel out of the ship. He added that he would declare a 'state of emergency' later this week to release state funds to deal with any environmental problems. Feher was last seen on deck en route to the area where he was supposed to board a lifeboat. According to Balog, Feher helped put lifejackets on several crying children before returning to his cabin. Feher's friend Ian Fraser, of Esh Winning in County Durham, was working alongside him as a singer on the trip and has paid tribute to him. Fraser, who jumped overboard and swam to for his life, said: 'I had worked with him on another contract before. 'He was a genius, a magnificent violinist. I had just spoken to him earlier in the day, he had been unwell with the flu.' Among the missing include 5-year-old Dayana Arlotti and her father, William Arlotti, who were on the cruise with the father's girlfriend. Near miss: Satellite tracking obtained by Lloyd's List shows how the Costa Concordia actually went closer to the shore in August 2011 . Peruvian crew member Erika Soria, 26, and American couple Jerry and Barbara Heil, from White Bear Lake in Minnesota, are also still unaccounted for. A U.S. congressional committee announced yesterday it will hold a hearing next month on the safety implications of the Costa Concordia accident. It said U.S. and international maritime organisations need to ensure standards are in place to protect passengers' safety on cruise ships. House arrest: Captain Francesco Schettino told magistrates his actions saved 'thousands of lives' Tragedy: Schettino faces the prospect of charges of multiple manslaughter, causing shipwreck and abandoning ship . Passengers have complained vocally about the chaotic evacuation and poor treatment by Costa officials once they got on land. Some have said they were provided only a single night of hotel accommodations and denied help getting to their embassies to get new passports. Costa owner, Miami-based Carnival Corp, responded yesterday by saying it was offering assistance and counselling to passengers and crew and was trying to take stock of lost possessions. In a statement it said: 'Costa has also begun the process of refunding all voyage costs including both passenger cruise fares and all costs incurred while on board. 'Our senior management teams are working together to determine additional support.' As further details continue to emerge, . yesterday the ship's 'Captain Coward' Francesco Schettino was quoted as . saying he tripped and fell into the water from the listing vessel and . never intended to abandon his passengers. Operation: Rescue workers are continuing to search the boat today . The $450 million Costa Concordia was carrying more than 4,200 passengers and crew when it slammed into a reef and capsized Friday after the captain made an unauthorised diversion from his programmed route and strayed into the perilous waters. Schettino, who was jailed after he left the ship before everyone was safely evacuated, was placed under house arrest on Tuesday, facing possible charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning his ship. The ship's operator, Crociere Costa SpA, has accused Schettino of causing the wreck by making the unapproved detour. The captain has acknowledged carrying out what he called a 'tourist navigation' that brought the ship closer to Giglio. Costa has said such a navigational 'fly-by' was done last in August after being approved by the company and Giglio port authorities.","Rough seas expected to hit island of Giglio later today, firefighters warn .

"Want to earn stuff by merely watching TV? There’s an app for that. A new app slated to be released today for iPhones and iPads rewards viewers for watching shows – the more shows the better. When you tap the screen, Viggle's software for iPhones and iPads listens to what's on, recognizes what you're watching and gives you credit at roughly two points per minute. Earning by watching: The Viggle App listens to what's on, recognizes what you're watching and gives you credit at roughly two points per minute . Down time: It would take about three weeks of heavy TV watching to earn a $5 gift card . It even works for shows you've saved on a digital video recorder. Rack up 7,500 points, and you'll be rewarded with a $5 gift card from retailers such as Burger King, Starbucks, Apple's iTunes, Best Buy and CVS, which you can redeem directly from your device.

You can also get extra points for watching an ad on your device. The beta version awarded 100 points for watching a 15-second ad from Verizon Wireless. The venture was launched by American Idol backer Robert Sillerman, whose former company, CKX, owns the popular show. ‘Viggle is the first loyalty program for TV,’ said Chris Stephenson, president of the company behind Viggle, Function (X) Inc. ‘We're basically allowing people to get rewards for doing something they're doing already and that they love to do.’ The idea behind Viggle is that by giving people an added reason to watch TV, the size of the audience will increase, thereby allowing makers of shows to earn more money from advertisers. Advertisers such as Burger King, Pepsi and Gatorade have also agreed to pay to have point-hungry users watch their ads on a mobile device. In exchange, users earn points, which Viggle converts into real value by buying gift cards at a slight discount from retailers.

"The riots that left whole neighbourhoods up and down the country in a state of ruin last August were the worst civil disturbances for a generation. But reading crime figures released yesterday, it is almost as if the five days of widespread looting and violence never took place. Nearly half of the areas worst-affected by the riots saw crime fall during that month, according to Home Office statistics. In Croydon, where a 144-year-old furniture shop was one of dozens of buildings burned to the ground and a photo of a woman jumping from a first-floor inferno became one of the defining images of the riots, police recorded just seven disorder offences (as well as 423 other disorder-related offences). Defining image: A woman jumps from a burning building in Croydon during last summer's riots. Police in the ravaged London borough recorded just seven public disorder offences . The disparity comes down to the way officers recorded the avalanche of offences committed during the unrest. Some forces classified hundreds of feral thugs rampaging through different streets in the same city as just one incident of public disorder. Similarly, mass looting in which one person broke into a shop only to be followed by dozens more was recorded as a single offence. And not one force reported the offence of rioting, officially defined as '12 or more people who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose'. In a statement, the Home Office said: 'It is important to understand the basis of crime recording to appreciate the impact of the disorder incidents on crime statistics. 'Police record crimes according to the number of specific victims, rather than the number of offenders.' But Trevor Reeves, the owner of the 144-year-old Reeves Furniture Store in Croydon that was destroyed in an arson attack, slammed the police's method of recording crime as 'crazy'. 'You would expect a great big blip in the crime statistics after those five days of rioting,' he told the Telegraph. 'It is crazy to put down something like looting as one crime and is unnecessary. The whole world saw what was happening and to record it like this will just make them look ridiculous.' National shame: The disparity comes down to the methods used by police officers to record the avalanche of offences committed during the unrest . Croydon burning: The 144-year-old Reeves Furniture Store in flames after an arson attack. Police forces classified hundreds of feral thugs rampaging through different streets as just one incident of public disorder . Police in the London borough of Southwark recorded just one public disorder offence despite five days of unrest and 314 other offences. Officers in Manchester also said crime fell during August, despite recording 11 public disorder offences and 386 related crimes. A total of 184 incidents of violent disorder and 5,112 connected offences were recorded by police forces across England. Despite this, nine of the 15 worst affected councils recorded more crime in August 2010 than a year later. The figures did show that knifepoint robberies rose by 10 per cent last year and that one victim is held up by a knife-carrying criminal every 35 minutes. On the rise: The number of robberies committed at knife-point rose by 10 per cent in the year to September 2011, new figures show (picture posed by models) Senior officers have warned the attacks are carried out by muggers determined to steal smartphones and cash. Separate figures show a double digit rise in the number of pickpocket thefts – the biggest increase for nearly a decade. Across England and Wales, robbery rose by 4 per cent in the year to September 2011 compared with the previous 12 months. There were 15,313 knifepoint robberies in the same period – up 10 per cent from the 13,971 offences a year earlier, the crime statistics showed. Around half of all robberies took place in London and the most common items stolen were smartphones, bags and cash. The Metropolitan Police recorded a 13 per cent rise in robberies in the capital and West Midlands Police recorded a 10 per cent increase. Policing minister Nick Herbert said there are areas of concern and crime remains too high . Former Met commissioner Lord Stevens, who is chairing a commission into the future of policing set up by Labour, said the rise in crimes against the person was ‘a bit alarming’. He said: ‘I’m not surprised. It’s really worrying. We’ve got to get on top of them really quickly or you could run out of control.’ The British Crime Survey, based on a poll of more than 40,000 victims, suggested a 5 per cent rise in burglary, and a 7 per cent increase in car theft. Pickpocket thefts rose by 12 per cent . to nearly 600,000, while garden shed break-ins fuelled a 15 per cent . rise in other thefts of personal property. However, overall recorded crime fell fractionally. The number recorded was down by 4 per cent to 4.1million. Chief . Constable Jon Murphy, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, . said: ‘While incidents in violence against the person fell, a continued . cause for concern was the increase in pickpocketing, robbery and robbery . with knives.’ ‘This has . been driven by a rise in robberies of personal property and police will . want to focus on tackling these offences and offering crime-prevention . advice.’ Meanwhile, the number of murders and other killings rose by 5 per cent in the year to March 2011, said the Home Office. That . is a rise of 28 – taking the total number of violent deaths to 636, up . from 608 in 2009/10. The latter includes the 12 victims of the Cumbrian . shootings in June 2010 by Derrick Bird. Ministers . are set to introduce a ‘tough’ law meaning automatic jail for anyone . caught carrying a knife with the intention of using it to commit a . crime. Currently just one . in five of those caught carrying a knife is given a jail term. The rest . are handed community sentences, fines or other punishments. Policing . minister Nick Herbert said: ‘Today’s crime figures cannot be used to . show there is a long-term change in either direction. There are areas of . concern and, as we have consistently said, crime remains too high. ‘We know good policing makes a difference.’ This article has been amended to report the number of disorder-related offences recorded in the areas worst-hit by the riots as well as the number of disorder offences. The reference to official crime statistics being ""airbrushed"" has been removed from the headline. Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has introduced a number of measures to reduce the prison population . Ken Clarke (right) has come under constant attack over his money-saving plans to reduce the prison population by 3,000 by putting fewer offenders behind bars. He stunned the Tory conference in 2010 by announcing he wanted to scrap prison term of less than six months in favour of community sentences. That policy was heavily criticised last month after it emerged a quarter of criminals break their non-custodial punishments. Last year, the Justice Secretary caused outrage by suggesting that some rapes were more serious than others as he attempted to defend proposed shorter jail terms for some rapists. Then last May it was revealed that less than a third of convicted muggers and car thieves end up in jail. Furthermore, just over half of drug dealers go to prison – and only 43 per cent of those who have sex with a child under 13 are put behind bars. The row within the Tory Party itself about the Justice Secretary's approach re-emerged in October when Home Secretary Theresa May and Boris Johnson urged him to extend minimum jail terms to under-18s. However, he dismissed their call. A month later, it emerged that youth courts are jailing just one in four teenage muggers. Most young criminals are facing nothing harsher than rehabilitation, fines or community service. Even during the 'crackdown' over August's riots, the average sentence was well below two years.","Police in Croydon, one of the worst-hit areas, recorded 7 disorder offences (as well as 423 other disorder-related crimes)

"Police want to question new suspect in the murder of a 57-year-old businessman who was found dead in his New York City home last Friday night. Surveillance video shows victim John Laubach being escorted into his apartment by two men Friday night, sources told the New York Post. One man was called in for questioning yesterday morning but was released without charge. The other man, sources say, is still at large, and so is Mr Laubach’s laptop. Suspect: Cops are looking to question this man in connection to the Chelsea slaying of a floral designer . John Laubach, 57, who was well known for carrying a parrot on his shoulder, was found bound and gagged in his apartment on Friday . Known in the Chelsea neighbourhood . for carrying his parrot Bolo on his shoulder, Laubach was tied to a . bedpost with an electrical cord. He was found by a female friend with his . hands and feet bound and duct tape over his mouth in what may have been . a sexual tryst gone wrong. The home had been ransacked, but police found no signs of forced entry. Sources told the New York Post that Mr . Laubach often met young men for sex and cops are investigating whether . his death was part of a sex game gone wrong. Mr Laubach, who had been running his own floral design business since 2000, was wearing just a white undershirt and his face was covered with a towel. A female friend had gone to Laubach’s fourth floor apartment in West 22nd Street to check on him after he failed to answer her calls. She called 911 just before 8pm after making the grim discovery. Victim: Police are investigating the possibility that Mr Laubach died in a sex game gone wrong and are questioning a 'person of interest' 'I always saw him walking around with a parrot on his shoulder,' a neighbor told the Post. 'He looked like Mel Brooks - just better looking.' His parrot was heard squawking in his apartment for several hours before the discovery of his body. Sources said the Maryland native, who moved to the building after selling his Fifth Avenue apartment in 2010 for  $650,000, was formerly a company CEO and had business interests overseas, according to the Post. He was in poor health, having suffered two strokes in the past. Laubach was a committed churchgoer, according to those who knew him, and often volunteered to help out at services. The fourth floor apartment in Chelsea, Manhattan, pictured, had been ransacked but police found no signs of forced entry . Bob Clemens, 57, who lived in the same building, told the Post that Mr Laubach and a female friend had a close relationship. 'They went to church every Sunday. They came to my Christmas party. They were totally cool and fun,' he said. Other locals recall him sitting on a bench near his apartment with the parrot on his shoulder. Mr Laubach’s former neighbors on Fifth Avenue described him as an outgoing person who had frequent male visitors, and regularly attended a nearby church.","Surveillance footage shows two men escorting John Laubach, 57, into his Chelsea apartment .

"A New Jersey house which burned down killing five residents did not have working fire alarms, it was claimed yesterday. A grandmother and four children died in the blaze on Thursday morning, which four other family members managed to escape. The mayor of South Plainfield said a fire service investigation had determined that the house's smoke alarms were not working properly. However, the family's landlord has insisted he installed proper file alarms and they were working when he last checked them in October. Tragic: Tyler Davis, seven, and a boy believed to be his brother Elijah Taylor, were among the five people who died in the raging house fire in South Plainfield, New Jersey . Perished: Their sister, Alizae, 12, was also killed into the two-family home when the blaze erupted in the early hours of this morning . Grandmother: Ann Jefferson, 62, was also trapped inside, with no way for firefighters to reach her . Ann Jefferson, 62, and her . grandchildren, 12-year-old Alizae, seven-year-old Tyler Davis, . two-year-old Elijah Taylor, and a boy, Chris, believed to be age five or . six, perished in the blaze. Another . baby girl, two-year-old Angel Taylor, was reportedly saved when her . teenage brother ran out of the burning home carrying her in his arms. Fifteen-year-old . Shaquan Phillips apparently tried to return inside to rescue other . family members, but was stopped by firefighters. A neighbour said he heard the . teenager desperately shouting 'Come out, come out, get out of the . house!' after the fire broke out. Jordan Taylor, eight, was said to be . in critical condition in a hospital's burns unit after escaping the . house with his mother, Natalie Jefferson, but the other three survivors . have now left hospital. Burnt out: A fire at this house in South Plainfield, New Jersey killed five members of the family . Destruction: The 130-year-old converted farmhouse was heavily damaged by the fatal blaze . Aftermath: Four other family members survived the fire, but an eight-year-old boy is in a critical condition . Raging: The fire was so extensive that emergency services had serious difficulty entering the house . The fire started at 3am on Thursday in the converted farmhouse, which is designed to hold two families. When . firefighters arrived at the scene, they had serious difficulty gaining . entry either to the first or second floor because of the extraordinary . volume of flames and smoke. 'There was just so much heat and fire,' South Plainfield's deputy fire chief told the Star-Ledger. Neighbour Isabel Scavino said her husband woke up to the sound of a screaming child, and the couple then heard what sounded like either gunshots or firecrackers. Ms Scavino said she saw a woman running from the home with several children, and a small child in her arms. 'The fire just spread out, it was just crazy. It looked like it started on the first floor and then just spread up to the roof in about a minute,' she said. Response: A teenager's attempts to save his siblings were barred by firefighters while the fire raged . Scene: The large house was apparently designed to hold two families . Authorities said that . there were five casualties, all found on the second floor of the house, . but were unable to confirm their identities. However, . a relative of the family told the Star-Ledger that the woman killed was . 62-year-old Ann Jefferson, and the four children - aged two to 11 - . were her grandchildren. One firefighter described his colleagues' agony at being unable to rescue the five victims, saying: 'It’s a very trying time.' Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce Kaplan said authorities were working to confirm the identities of the victims and the causes of death. He said police and the prosecutor's office were investigating the cause of the fire. Two volunteer firefighters received minor injuries when they were involved in a two-vehicle crash en route to the fire.","Fire broke out at 130-year-old house in South Plainfield, NJ .

"A mass suicide attack which was to target buses in the Afghan capital of Kabul has been foiled. Intelligence officials seized 11 custom made 'suicide jackets' in the country's ministry of defence, less than a mile from the presidential palace. Several Afghans, some reportedly soldiers in the Afghan National Army, were arrested and are now being questioned. The discovery came on the same day two British servicemen were murdered by a renegade Afghan soldier who tried to trick his way into their fortified base. A British soldier on patrol in Afghanistan: The two men were shot dead inside a British army base in Lashkar Gar . As the Royal Military Police began . investigating yesterday’s tragedy, it emerged that the gunman went . berserk after a row broke out at the entrance to the British military . compound in Lashkar Gah, Helmand. Lieutenant . Gul Nazir is said to have arrived in an army vehicle with several men . pretending to be assigned to guard a delegation of VIPs visiting the . base. But when he was challenged by guards . and told to wait outside, he opened fire with an M16 semi-automatic . rifle, killing the two men and wounding a third. Ghulam Farooq Parwani, deputy . commander of the Afghan National Army (ANA) in Helmand, said the gunman . had told sentries he was providing security for government ministers . from Kabul. Tragic: The shooting took place at the British HQ in Lashkar Gar in Helmand province . But there was a ‘verbal clash’ and . Nazir started shooting. Mr Parwani said: ‘He got close to the troops – . three or four metres – and he opened fire.’ British forces shot him dead after he . killed a Royal Marine and a soldier from the staff and personnel . support department of the Adjutant General’s Corps. A total of 407 British troops have now been killed since the war began in 2001. Fifteen Nato troops have been killed . by their Afghan allies in the first three months of 2012 – one in six of . all coalition dead. The attack comes three weeks after . the deadliest attack on UK troops during the conflict. Six soldiers died . when their Warrior vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. Tragic: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told the Commons that details of the incident, which occurred at the British HQ in Lashkar Gar in Helmand province, were still emerging . The joint British-Afghan investigation announced yesterday will try to discover whether Nazir was working for the Taliban. The renegade soldier was a member of . the Fourth Kandak of 3-215 Brigade and had been a soldier for four . years. The Taliban said he had been in close contact with them. But a . military insider in Whitehall said: ‘The Taliban often over-egg their . involvement for propaganda.’ Yesterday’s killings are the third . ‘green on blue’ attack in which Afghan security forces have murdered . British servicemen. On November 3, 2009, an Afghan policeman called . Gulbuddin – who was angry after being repeatedly disciplined – . slaughtered five UK troops with an AK47 as they relaxed following a . patrol in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand. Six British soldiers and . two Afghan policemen were wounded. UK military chiefs denied Taliban . claims that Gulbuddin was working for them. Then on July 13, 2010, three British troops were gunned down by an Afghan soldier after a row over bottled water. Sergeant Talib Hussein, 23, who was . being mentored by the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles, launched a . machine-gun and grenade attack. Relations between British and Afghan . forces had flared when a Gurkha temple at the base was vandalised after . an Afghan was reprimanded for taking bottles of chilled water. The latest attack follows unrest . after tensions were inflamed in February when copies of the Koran were . burned at a U.S. base. And they reached boiling point two weeks ago when . a U.S. sergeant went on the rampage in Kandahar province killing 17 . villagers, including nine children. In a Commons statement on the latest . deaths, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told MPs the attack was ‘a . deeply personal tragedy’ for the victims’ families. A U.S. Nato service member was also killed by an Afghan policeman yesterday at a checkpoint in eastern Afghanistan.","Planned attack targeting buses in capital of Kabul .

"A Mexican woman who claimed to be pregnant with nine babies is not expecting and is simply clinically obese, health officials have said. They have also revealed it would be impossible for Karla Vanessa Perez to be carrying nonuplets because her fallopian tubes have been removed. The 32-year-old has also been branded a liar for saying she'd given birth to triplets just weeks before conceiving her 'new record-breaking brood'. Nonamum: Karla Perez has been branded a liar by doctors and health officials who say she is nothing but an attention seeker . Proud father: Karla does have three children with mechanic husband Juan Bernardo Garcia Morales, but they are four, 12 and 15-years-old . She does have three children with car mechanic husband Juan Bernardo Garcia Morales - but they are four, 12 and 15-years-old. Doctor José Salvador Gallegos Mata told El Diario de Coahuila: 'Everything is a crude joke, hatched by a person with an evident and . urgent need to say, ""Here I am! Come and see me! I exist!' 'Humanly and scientifically a pregnancy of nine would only be possible through IVF. 'But never through natural methods, and even less so when a woman who has undergone a salpingectomy (the surgical removal of the Fallopian tubes she had following the birth of her youngest child). Work station: The garage where Karla's mechanic husband Bernardo plies his trade . 'This woman needs urgent psychiatric help, because now the hoax has . been discovered she will not know how to confront it, how to solve the . problem she has created. 'She will become terribly depressed, which could lead to her hurting herself and, at a given time, could try to commit suicide'. While the absence of Fallopian tubes does not always prevent pregnancy, Perez's claimed lack of IVF treatment and the number of babies expected would make it a huge improbability. Perez stunned the world when, last week, she claimed she was due to give birth on May 20 to six girls and three boys. Initial doubts were cast after another . local doctor came forward and said she recently performed an ultra-sound . on and her uterus was empty. Home: Nonamum, as she has been dubbed, is from the northeastern state of Coahuila, which borders Texas . But Perez, from the north-eastern state of Coahuila, insisted she was being treated for the pregnancy at a hospital in Saltillo. She told Notimex: 'It's very early to think of names for the babies. First I hope that everything goes well.' The successful delivery of the now 'phantom nonuplets' would have been one of the highest multiple births ever recorded. In 2009, a woman in California gave birth to octuplets, sparking worldwide media attention. Mother-of-14 Nadya Suleman, 36, from La Habra, was dubbed 'Octomum' has since become a television personality in the U.S. Octomum: Nadya Suleman pictured here with her octuplets. She also has six other children . However, since the birth of her eight new children she has faced problems and been close to being evicted from her home. Her children are now being monitored by officials with the California Children's Services Department. * EDITOR'S NOTE - While there is clearly room for debate about . the correct grammatical term for a woman who has nine children, the classicists . at MailOnline have insisted on using the ordinal Latin term, nona, meaning . ninth, rather than the cardinal alternative, novem, meaning nine, or indeed the . Greek, ennea. A set of nonuplets was born on June 13, 1971 in Sydney, Australia, to Geraldine Brodrick. None of the five boys and four girls lived. Two were stillborn and the last to survive died six days after birth. Nonuplets were also born on March 26, 1999, in Malaysia to Zurina Mat Saad. She had five boys and four girls (Adam, Nuh, Idris, Soleh, Hud, Aishah, Khadijah, Fatimah and Umi Kalsom) but none of them survived more than six hours. Nadya Suleman - or 'Octomum' - holds the world record for the most children delivered at a single birth to survive with her eight babies. Before that, the record was held by Bobbie McCaughey, who gave birth to four boys and three girls in 1997 at the University hospital, Iowa in United State of America. The greatest recorded number of children born to one mother in the world, according to Guinness is 69. In 27 pregnancies, the first wife of Feodor Vassilyev of Russia gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets in the 17th century.","Karla Vanessa Perez branded a liar by health officials .

"Soldier: Kevin Corley was recently discharged from the Army after serving in Afghanistan His cousin Jerome was killed in the DEA raid . A current and a former U.S. Army soldier were among three men busted in an elaborate drug trafficking sting, in which one of their comrades was shot and killed. A Drug Enforcement Administration agent shot Jerome Corley on Saturday in Laredo, Texas, where federal authorities busted three men, including an Army sergeant and a recently discharged officer, who thought they would be hired as assassins for Mexico's brutal Zetas drug cartel. The Zetas was founded around a group of elite Mexican troops that went rogue to work for the Gulf cartel, south of Texas. They later split to build their own extremely violent and well-armed group involved in drug trafficking, kidnap and extortion. Among the arrested was Corley's cousin Kevin Corley, 29, of Colorado Springs, Colorado, who served in Afghanistan and was discharged from the Army on March 13, according to an Army spokeswoman. Also arrested were Samuel Walker, 28, of Colorado Springs, an active-duty sergeant, according to a spokeswoman at Fort Carson; and Shavar Davis, 29, of Denver. The DEA launched the sting operation in January 2011, after two men in South Carolina told undercover agents posing as Zetas drug cartel members about Kevin Corley, who the men said could sell the agents fully automatic weapons and sniper rifles, according to a criminal complaint. Kevin Corley told undercover agents that he was an Army officer who trained soldiers and could provide a murder-for-hire team to raid a ranch and recover 20 kilograms of cocaine stolen by a rival cartel, the complaint states. He said he would carry out the contract killing with his cousin for $50,000 and five kilograms of cocaine, the complaint states. He offered to refund the money if the team did not retrieve the Zetas' cocaine and execute their rival. On March 5, Kevin Corley sold two AR-15 . assault rifles with scopes, an Airsoft assault rifle, five stolen . ballistic vests and other equipment to an undercover DEA agent for . $10,000 in Colorado Springs, Colo., prosecutors said. Busted: Samuel Walker, left, an active duty sergeant, and Shavar Davis, right were arrested in the elaborate DEA raid . At that meeting, Corley discussed the murder-for-hire job with the undercover agent, saying he had purchased a new Ka-Bar knife to carve a 'Z' in the victim's chest - a calling card of the Zetas cartel - and a hatchet to dismember his body, the complaint states. The operation reached its climax on Saturday in Laredo, when undercover agents confirmed that Corley and three others were ready to move forward with the supposed cartel assassination, the complaint states. Undercover agents called for an arrest team to detain the four men. Shortly thereafter, an agent fired several shots that struck and killed Jerome Corley, the complaint states. Davis, Walker and Kevin Corley remain in federal custody pending a detention hearing on federal drug conspiracy and weapons charges in Laredo. Kevin Corley was a first lieutenant who was on active duty in the Army from November 19, 2008 to March 13, 2012, according to U.S. Army Lt. Col. Laurel Devine. Walker is assigned to the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, Colo., according to Dee McNutt, a spokeswoman at Fort Carson. Years of murder: Nearly 50,000 people have been killed in raging drug cartel-related violence across Mexico since late 2006 . Agents also arrested Marcus Mickle, 20, and Calvin Epps, 26, in South Carolina on drug conspiracy charges. They are accused of working with Walker and Kevin Corley to move loads of cocaine and marijuana between South Carolina and Texas. Also arrested was Mario Corley, 40, of Saginaw, Texas, a cousin of Kevin Corley's who is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana. The most serious charge lodged in the case - conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 5 kg of cocaine - carries between 10 years and life in prison and up to a $10million fine. Situated along the U.S.-Mexico border, Laredo is bordered to the south by Nuevo Laredo, considered by the DEA to be a stronghold of the Zetas drug cartel. Nearly 50,000 people have been killed in raging cartel-related violence across Mexico since late 2006.

"It should be a no-brainer but then the same ought to have applied to the Liverpool Lip learning his lesson. Surely Colombia, complete with the luxurious skills of new kid on the World Cup block James Rodriguez, will beat Uruguay, minus the penetration of bitter old Luis Suarez. That is what pretty much everyone except Suarez’s countrymen seem to want the outcome to be on this first day of the round of the last 16. While Suarez left the revulsion of Brazil 2014 for a warped hero’s welcome in Montevideo, the Maracana was making ready to admire the refreshing Colombians. But there is a danger here. VIDEO Scroll down to see 'Jose Pekerman: Uruguay a top notch team even without Suarez' In form: Colombia won all three of their games to finish top of Group C and are favourites against Uruguay . Fine tuning: Uruguay train at the Estadio Sao Januario on the eve of their last-16 clash . Setting: The two South American sides will clash at the Maracana on Saturday . Back in town: Luis Suarez returned to Uruguay to a hero's welcome at Carrasco International Airport . A bunker mentality often wins football matches and no team is more huddled together against the outside world than Uruguay. In fact that entire South American country is shutting out criticism of Suarez the serial biter. Even their president is rallying behind him despite it being this man himself – not the English media, a FIFA conspiracy or anything else they care to blame – who has shot his team in the foot. How will the players he has left behind react? If they feel sorry for themselves, they will be soft pickings for Colombia. But the indications are that they are angry about their star striker being expelled from the tournament and are bristling to make a statement. It could be ugly. Passionate: Supporters waited at Carrasco International Airport to greet the arrival of Suarez . Speaking his mind: Colombia manager Jose Pekerman addresses the media at a press conference . Working out: Colombia forward Jackson Martinez (left) and defender Carlos Valdes during training . There are times when there is a sinister side to Uruguay. Their best teams – starting with the two-time World Cup winners back in the 1950s – create beautiful memories. But when it goes against them they can, as Suarez so sharply demonstrates, leave a sour taste in the mouth. Either way, they are never easy meat. Colombia are one of the pleasant surprises here. Their attacking football has captured the imagination. Young Rodriguez is an international legend in the making and it helps that he has Jackson Martinez to help carry the goalscoring burden. Teofilio Gutiierrez is not too shabby, either. But they should take nothing for granted. Dangerman: Colombia playmaker James Rodriguez goes for a jog during a training session in Rio . Eyes on the prize: Teofilo Gutierrez (left), Carlos Bacca and Mario Alberto Yepes (right) during training . If ever there will be a moment for Edinson Cavani to explain to a wider audience outside France why Paris St Germain invested a fortune in him, this is it. Cavani, with his flamboyant style, often flatters to deceive but Uruguay need him to fill the goal void now. The  enforced absence of Suarez also gives veteran forward Diego Forlan another day in the World Cup sunshine. The Latin Americans, as usual when the World Cup is played on this continent, have been prospering but one of them has to go out. Stepping up: Edinson Cavani joins in with a training session on the eve of the game against Colombia . Uphill task: Uruguay know they are underdogs against Colombia without star striker Suarez . Hugs all round: Diego Forlan could have a bigger role to play for Uruguay in Suarez's absence . It is worth Colombia reminding themselves that Uruguay were deeply unimpressive in qualifying, reaching Brazil only courtesy of a ridiculously easy play off against Jordan. Hindsight tells us, also, that the group in which they defeated both England and Italy was nothing like as strong as we fondly imagined. Costa Rica are living proof of that. The grand stage of the Maracana is set for Rodriguez to give most of the world what it wants from this match. But with Uruguay in this defiant mood, the 22-year-old prodigy must not expect a gentle ride.","Colombia face Uruguay in second round clash in Rio de Janeiro .

"Several members of  England’s Euro 2012 squad travelled to the Auschwitz death camp yesterday. Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart were among those who toured the gas chambers, while the rest of the squad stayed closer to their Krakow base to visit the enamel factory where Oskar Schindler protected Jews from the SS and Gestapo. Hart, Rooney and the national team manager Roy Hodgson were joined by Leighton Baines, Theo Walcott, Andy Carroll, Jack Butland and Phil Jagielka, as well as former Chelsea manager Avram Grant, who lost 15 members of his family at the camp.

Wayne Rooney leaves the gas chamber and crematoria during a visit by an England Football Association delegation to the Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial and former concentration camps .

Sombre visit: Wayne Rooney and other members of the England team  during a visit to the Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial and former concentration camp, ahead of UEFA Euro 2012 . ‘To round people up like cattle and bring them to a place just to be killed – I don’t think I can find a word to describe that,’ he said. ‘I think the worst moment for me was when we went to see the suitcases of the victims and you saw the age difference of those who died – anything from 60 years to three years old.’ Goalkeeper Hart added: ‘It is the scale of the place that hits you, the numbers that walked through those gates with absolutely no hope of survival. When we went to see the place where the bodies were cremated, we were told 90 per cent of those who walked through that door were dead within the hour.’ Members of the England team enter the Nazi concentration camp, Auschwitz, under the sign which translates into: 'Work makes you free' England's visit to the camp is part of an ongoing partnership with the Holocaust Educational Trust .

I will go back to the hotel and think about what has been said . to us by the guide. 'Most . youngsters today have a glorified image of a ghetto but the ghettos we . have learned about today are not like that. I did not have a full . understanding of what the word means.' Guide: Avram Grant, whose father Meir survived the Holocaust, shows England around . The trip was filmed and will be included in a DVD used in secondary schools to educate students about the Holocaust . Roy Hodgson, right, speaks to former Chelsea manager Avram Grant, whose family suffered and died at Auschwitz, during a visit by England FA members to the death camp . The national team manager Roy Hodgson wore his sombre blue England suit, while his players appeared more casual in polo shirts and trainers. Earlier this week, Italian players visited Auschwitz in tracksuits, while the Dutch team opted for faded jeans and trainers. The Auschwitz Museum advises visitors: ‘On the Museum grounds, visitors should behave with the appropriate solemnity and respect. Dress should be appropriate for a place of this nature.’ However, last night the FA said the players had been advised to wear ‘more comfortable clothing’ due to the six-hour round trip between Auschwitz and their base in Krakow. They were also told that training shoes would help them on the ‘uneven’ ground.The rest of the squad made the shorter journey to the enamel factory in Krakow made famous by the film Schindler’s List. ‘The players made it clear which of them wanted to go to Auschwitz,’ said one FA source. ‘It was left completely up to them as to which trip they decided to go on.’ England team members visited Oskar Schindler's former factory near Krakow and left their mark signing a football and the visitors' book . Members of the squad saw items manufactured in the factory, which employed Jewish people and saved them from death camps . Schindler's List: The names of Jewish people saved from the death camps by Oskar Schindler's factory . The visit to Auschwitz, organised by the Holocaust Educational Trust, took place after two Holocaust survivors spoke to the squad in England before they flew to Poland earlier this week. At the end of the guided tour, FA chairman David Bernstein and Hodgson donned skull caps and lit candles in memory of the dead. Mr Grant's father, Meir Granat, was . just a teenager when his father decided to uproot his family and flee . their hometown of Mlawa, Poland in 1937. Meir's . father Avram, feared that something terrible would happen and took his . wife and nine of their ten children on a three-year trek to find safety - . across Poland, into the horrors of the Warsaw camp and eventually to a . remote forest in Russia.

According . to an interview with the BBC, Grant explained that one child, Hertsel, . was hidden in a monastery, Rachel and Estera were placed in . an orphanage and the rest were constantly moved around Eastern Europe in . search of safety. Two of Grant's . father's . siblings - Koppel & Hannah - were pulled from their train when it . stopped and were never seen again. He later discovered that both died at . Auschwitz. The rest of his father's family along . with many other Jews were taken by train deep into Russia's wilderness . and offloaded to die in temperatures as low as -40C.

His father's sister Sarah, aged 15, was the first to die after eating poisonous mushrooms. Sarah was the first of seven family members Meir was forced to bury, digging their graves with his own hands. He also buried his own mother and father. Grant first visited the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, where members of his family died, in 1988 and returns each year with . Holocaust survivors for the 'March of the Living'. He told the BBC . however that his father Meir, who died in October 2009, never went back . to Poland, because he couldn't face it. Yesterday saw the first games of Euro 2012 take place, hours after the Dutch team said they were subjected to racist chanting as they trained in Krakow. UEFA has told referees to stop matches if racist chants persist. The story of Oskar Schindler, whose factory was visited by many of the England squad, has been told in a novel and a Hollywood blockbuster movie. The ethnic German industrialist, born in Moravia, is credited with saving more than 1,100 Jews during the Second World War. He shielded Jewish workers from the Nazis by employing them in his enamelware and ammunitions factories. Schindler was a regular guest at Nazi SS parties from the early stages of the war, but increasingly protected his Jewish staff as Hitler's anti-Semitic extermination campaign progressed. He was appalled when many of his workers were rounded up and killed in a 1943 raid on a Jewish ghetto in Krakow. He later sought to use all his powers of persuasion to shield workers from deportation and death. One such occasion is recounted by author Eric Silver in The Book of the Just: The Unsung Heroes Who Rescued Jews from Hitler. 'Two Gestapo men came to his office and demanded that he hand over a family of five who had bought forged Polish identity papers,' Silver wrote. '""Three hours after they walked in,"" Schindler said, ""two drunk Gestapo men reeled out of my office without their prisoners and without the incriminating documents they had demanded"".' Germany classed Schindler's factory as a 'business essential to the war effort', which enabled him to claim exemptions for his workers whenever they were threatened with deportation. Wives, children and the handicapped were shown to be necessary mechanics and metalworkers. Schindler died in October 1974 aged 66. His protection of Jews was reimagined in Thomas . Keneally's 1982 novel Schindler's Ark and Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning 1993 film Schindler's List.","Grant asked Hodgson to join the squad's Auschwitz visit to explain to them what happened .

"A New York City police officer shot a dog who apparently snapped at him in a sad scene on  a busy Manhattan street. The dog is reportedly clinging to life after the shooting, which occurred on the corner of 2nd Avenue and 14th Street in the East Village neighbourhood on Monday. Officers responded to the corner on a report of a sick man, and found a homeless individual in front of a KFC there, who appeared to have had a seizure. Tragic pooch: The pit bull was shot on 14th Street in New York City . Crime scene: The shooting happened outside a KFC on the corner of 14th Street and 2nd Avenue in Manhattan's East Village neighbourhood . But as the officers tried to wake him, a dog - which witnesses said belonged to the man - began growling at them. The dog then leapt up at the officer, who fired one shot, striking the dog in the head as terrified bystanders looked on. Despite earlier reports that the pit bull was killed, the animal, whose name is reportedly Star, is clinging to life at Animal Care & Control in the East Harlem neighbourhood. The man was not identified, but those at the scene told DNAInfo.com that he was a drifter from Poland, who often hung out on the corner with the dog. While some witnesses said that the officer was only defending himself, others accused the officer of using excessive force. Justified? While some witnesses said that the officer was only defending himself, others accused the officer of using excessive force . Investigation: An investigator closes off a portion of the sidewalk where the dog was shot . One onlooker, who wished not to . be identified, told Gothamist that officers had sprayed mace or pepper . spray at the pit bull before the shot rang out. Aida Feliciano, who lives nearby, told the New York Daily News that the man was kicked by officers, prompting the dog to become defensive of its owner. She said: 'Instead of calling the ambulance, they started kicking him.' Another witness told NY1: 'I talked to the cop afterwards. He was very shaken up. He's a dog lover and it ruined his week, if not his year. And he did what he had to do to protect himself.' Investigation: The busy street corner was blocked off by police tape following the shooting . Grisly scene: The dog's blood was pictured on 14th Street after the shooting . The homeless man was taken to Bellevue Hospital for treatment of minor injuries. The officer was also hospitalised for ringing in his ears. The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment. The incident came just days after another officer-involved shooting in Manhattan, where officers opened fire on a crazed man brandishing a knife near Times Square. The officers involved in that shooting claimed they acted in self-defence, and only fired when the man, identified as Darrius Kennedy, lunged at them.

"A former altar-boy-turned-vigilante who murdered a gay man he wrongly believed to be a paedophile was told today he may spend the rest of his life behind bars. Christopher Hunnisett, 28, battered supermarket worker Peter Bick, 57, over the head with a hammer just four months after being freed from jail following his acquittal for a vicar’s murder. In a cold-blooded plan hatched in his prison cell, the 'self-appointed judge, jury and executioner' made it his personal mission to rid the world of child molesters after he compiled a hit list of suspects, on which he put Mr Bick at the top. Hit-list: Christopher Hunnisett, 28, left, put Peter Bick, 57, right, at the top of a list of men he planned to kill because he suspected they were paedophiles, the court heard . But a court earlier heard that he lured Mr Bick to his death, despite there ‘not being a shred of evidence’ that he was a paedophile. He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years at Woolwich Crown Court in south-east London today. Hit list: This chilling piece of paper entitled 'Tango priorities' has the names and addressed of people Hunnisett was intent on killing . But the judge, Mr Justice Saunders, warned he was an 'extremely dangerous man' who 'may well kill again' if released in the foreseeable future. The judge said: 'The time may never come when this defendant is considered safe to be released.' Hunnisett previously spent more than nine years in jail for killing the Rev Ronald Glazebrook, 81, in his bath and cutting up his body in April 2001. But his conviction was quashed and he was cleared of Mr Glazebrook’s murder at a retrial during which he alleged that the priest sexually abused him. After being freed from prison in September 2010, Hunnisett, of Hastings, East Sussex, made a 'hit list' of men he planned to kill in his bid to rid the world of paedophiles. Having formulated a plan to track down child abusers and rapists while he was in custody, on his release he set up false internet accounts as a 'honeytrap' for sex offenders. Mr Bick, an Asda employee from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, was at the top of Hunnisett’s list of targets, although the prosecution said there was 'not a shred of evidence' that he was a paedophile. Having split up from his long-term partner, the supermarket worker regularly used social networking and dating websites to meet young men for consensual sex, the trial heard. Overnight on January 10-11 last year, Hunnisett had sex with Mr Bick at his flat before brutally smashing his head with five severe hammer blows and strangling him with a shoelace. Claims: Hunnisett, left, alleged that he was abused by Rev Ronald Glazebrook, right. Hunnisett served eight years of a life sentence for the clergyman's killing, but was later acquitted of his murder . The killer tried to cover his tracks by sending text messages falsely suggesting that the supermarket worker believed he was meeting a 15-year-old boy. Mr Justice Saunders said Hunnisett went to Mr Bick’s flat prepared to kill him, and carried out a 'planned and cold-blooded' attack. He noted that the defendant had an 'intense hatred' of paedophiles, having suffered abuse as a child. The judge said: 'He believes that the penalties handed out by the courts for child abuse are inadequate. 'For him the appropriate penalty, if he considers it necessary, is death. He has appointed himself judge, jury and executioner. 'However good the evidence of child abuse, the defendant was not entitled to take the law into his hands in the way he did but, as he demonstrated in this case, he was prepared to reach his conclusions on entirely inadequate evidence.' Brutal: This was the contents of a green rucksack - including a knife, passport and road atlas - that killer Christopher Hunnisett had with him while travelling in Peter Bick's Fiesta car . Facing life: Hunnisett, pictured handcuffed to security guards during his trial while held on remand, tried to leap from the dock to escape when he was found guilt of murder. Hunnisett, who who has a bizarre tattoo covering his back, will be sentenced later . Mr Justice Saunders observed that Hunnisett’s hatred of paedophiles grew during his time in prison, where he might have come into contact with sex offenders who showed a lack of remorse for the harm they committed. He said: 'The evidence that I have heard has driven me to the conclusion that the defendant is now an extremely dangerous man who may well kill again were he to be released in the foreseeable future. 'The parole board will undoubtedly take all that into account when deciding when, and if, this defendant should ever be released.' David Martin-Sperry, mitigating, said that while in prison Hunnisett was forced to play the role of an abuse victim in therapy sessions organised for sex offenders. He was then freed after being acquitted of Mr Glazebrook’s murder without being prepared for his release and with no authority responsible for supervising him in the community. Caught: Hunnisett was pictured driving murder victim Peter Bick's Fiesta car immediately after the killing . Hunnisett, unshaven in a black and grey casual jacket, made no reaction as his sentence was passed, but mouthed a few words to family members in the public gallery as he was led away by court guards. Following the case, Detective Chief Inspector Nick Sloan of the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'This was a terrible crime, and the jury were clearly unconvinced by Hunnisett’s claims about his motives for carrying out such a cruel and deliberate killing. 'Peter Bick’s sister, together with her husband, was present at court throughout the trial and they had to listen to Christopher Hunnisett deliver utterly unfounded personal attacks about the character of her brother. 'They endured this with great dignity and this is testimony to how they have conducted themselves since Peter was murdered. 'What exactly was motivating Hunnisett in the lead up to the murder and afterwards we will perhaps never really know, but there is no doubt at all that society is a safer place now that he is in prison.'","Christopher Hunnisett, 28, murdered gay supermarket worker he believed to be a sex offender .

Niles said she was visited by officers who assured her they would keep her updates, but have only visited once to say a family liaison officer would visit - but who not yet contacted her. A serious case review has been launched into the death of the little girl. Serious Case Reviews are carried out when a child has died to look at the role played by local agencies in the life of that child and their family. The review aims to find out if any lessons can be learned about ensuring children’s safety. Merton Council, which has responsibility for Mitcham, where Tia had lived with her mother Natalie, said it was 'standard procedure' to carry out a review. Chief executive Ged Curran said: 'Our thoughts and condolences go out to all those who knew Tia. 'The local safeguarding children board will now commission a serious case review, the standard procedure in a tragic case such as this. The review will be assisted by the police, health services and local authorities.' The Government’s guidance on the matter, Working Together To Safeguard Children, states: 'The prime purpose of a Serious Case Review (SCR) is for agencies and individuals to learn lessons to improve the way in which they work both individually and collectively to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. 'The lessons learned should be disseminated effectively, and the recommendations should be implemented in a timely manner so that the changes required result, wherever possible, in children being protected from suffering or being likely to suffer harm in the future.'

Tragic: The child was from East Ayrshire in Scotland. She was treated in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow, pictured, but sadly died . NHS Ayrshire and Arran said it has not identified the source of the infection but it does not believe the case is part of an outbreak. Dr Jane Cooper, consultant in public health medicine said: 'Our thoughts are with the family during this very difficult time. 'Sometimes it is possible to identify a particular source of E.coli O157 infection. An outbreak may occur if a number of people are exposed to the same source. 'NHS Ayrshire & Arran is satisfied that this case is not part of an outbreak, and has not identified a particular source which might represent a risk to others. 'E. coli O157 infection is very easily picked up and sometimes investigations cannot identify either a particular source, or any way in which the risk of infection could have been avoided.' Symptoms normally develop after ingesting contaminated foods or liquids or having been in contact with infected animals.

A spokesman for University Hospital of North Staffordshire said: 'Three patients remain in hospital and all are in a stable or improving condition.' It was revealed earlier this month that the probable cause of the outbreak was a hot tub at JTF Warehouse in the city after samples were found to have an unusual strain of legionella bacteria, which matched that of the strain taken from patients with the illness. Dr Sue Ibbotson, regional director of HPA West Midlands, said the organisation has taken detailed histories from those with Legionnaires’ and the majority of confirmed cases visited the warehouse in the two weeks before they fell ill. The samples from the hot tub at JTF Warehouse in City Road, Fenton, were confirmed by the Health Protection Agency’s specialist laboratory in Colindale as being the unusual strain legionella bacteria.",It comes after another case of Legionnaires’ disease has been confirmed in Stoke-on-Trent .
"There could be a deadly killer in your home – the kitchen tap. Last year in Louisiana, two people died from a single-celled organism that thrives in warm, freshwater after using tap water for flushing their sinuses. The amoeba, known as Naegleria fowleri, can cause primary amoebic meningoecephalitis (PAM), which is fatal in 99 per cent of cases. Deadly infection: The amoeba, known as Naegleria fowleri, can cause primary amoebic meningoecephalitis (PAM), which is fatal in 99 per cent of cases . The nose knows: In 2011, two people in Louisiana who used tap water in neti pots to flush out their sinuses caught the deadly infection . Both victims, a 51-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man, had used tap water in neti pots to flush out their sinuses and died days later. They lived in separate areas of the state. Neti pots are generally safe for use for clearing out excess mucus in the nasal cavity, but when amoebas are present, the infection has a frighteningly fatal rate. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the amoeba enters the brain through the nasal passage, especially when people go swimming in warm freshwater lakes and ponds. In a report published by Dr Jonathan Yoder, who works at the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, a division of the CDC, concluded that in both cases, the victims had only come in contact with the amoeba from tap water. He and a group of researchers tested the . water from both houses. Their results were published in Clinical . Infectious Diseases on August 23. Dr Yoder and the other authors found the amoeba in the kitchen spigot, shower, bathtub, and bathroom sink in the woman’s home. Path of infection: N. fowleri can only enter the body through the nasal passage or broken skin, not through drinking water . Growth process: The single-celled amoeba is also called a brain-eating amoeba; later symptoms can include hallucinations and seizures . They found Naegleria fowleri in a tankless water heater in the home of the 28-year-old man. The authors noted that the municipal water sources were not contaminated in either case. The residents lived in different parts of the state. The CDC says that one cannot contract the organism simply through drinking water, and urges those using nasal irrigation systems to either use distilled or bottled water, or boil their tap water for at least a minute to ensure the Naegleria fowleri amoeba is killed. The centre also notes that there have been few infections in the U.S. throughout the past decades. Preventative measures: The CDC recommends that those near warm, fresh water avoid swimming in it, or holding your nose when going underwater . From 2002 to 2011, there were 32 infections reported. Included in those statistics are the two people from Louisiana who used neti pots to flush out their noses. Initial symptoms begin five days after infection, but could take as long as seven, and include headache, fever, nausea, and even vomiting. In the later phases when the amoeba reaches the brain tissue, those suffering from the infection may lose balance, hallucinate, and experience seizures, and in 99 per cent of cases, die. The CDC notes that only one person out of 123 infected has survived. It reminds those who will be swimming in warm, fresh water to use nasal plugs, hold one’s nose shut, or avoid going under water altogether, though infection from N. fowleri is extremely rare.","In 2011, two people in Louisiana died after using tap water for nasal irrigation .

"Texas congressman and libertarian firebrand Ron Paul turned down a speaking slot in the upcoming Republican National Convention after GOP leaders had demanded that he fully endorse Mitt Romney. In an interview with the New York Times, Paul, a long-time vocal critic of the Republican Party, said that he declined to take part in the high-profile event set to begin in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday after being unable to meet the organizers’ conditions. The 77-year-old congressman said that convention planners offered him a chance to speak only if he delivered an address pre-approved by the Romney campaign, and insisted that he give ‘full-fledged’ endorsement of the presumptive presidential nominee. No love lost: Texas Congressman Ron Paul, right, turned down a slot in the convention lineup after declining to deliver a speech pre-approved by Mitt Romney's, left, camp and refusing to fully endorse him . ‘It wouldn’t be my speech,’ Paul said. ‘That would undo everything I’ve done in the last 30 years. I don’t fully endorse him for president.’ Paul himself was vying for the coveted nomination, but in May, he had effectively ended his third bid for the White House when he announced that he would stop formally campaigning. Despite his decision to leave the race, Paul’s passionate supporters – many of them college students and small-government types – held on to the hope that the 77-year-old politician could amass enough support to challenge Romney. Firebrand: Paul electrified a crowd of nearly 10,000 of his supporters that gathered at a rally in Tampa on Sunday . Die-hard devotees: Although Paul had announced the end of his presidential bid in May, several hundreds of the delegates are still pledged to him . Romney's camp has made attempts at reconciliation with Paul and his followers – especially since several hundred delegates are still pledged to back the Texas congressman. According to CBS News, a short video paying tribute to Paul will be shown during the convention. However, the touching gesture is not likely to change Paul’s mind regarding his endorsement of Romney. While Paul may not have an official role at the upcoming convention, the 77-year-old congressman used the days before the start of the event to ensure that his voice in heard loud and clear. Unbending principals: During his speech at the rally, Paul reiterated his fervent opposition to big government and the Federal Reserve . On Sunday, Paul staged a six-hour rally in Tampa, whipping some 10,000 of his devotees into a frenzy with a provocative speech attacking both the Republican establishment and President Barack Obama, Fox News reported. Paul, who has spent many decades pushing for the reduction in the size of government, elimination of the Federal Reserve and return to the gold standard, accused the GOP of bending, breaking and rewriting the rules of Washington for too long. ‘The answer is not more efficient government,’ he told a large crowd gathered in Sun Dome stadium at the University of South Florida. ‘It's getting government out of things they're not supposed to be doing.’ He added, ‘The worst thing we could do is be silent.’","Convention organizers asked Paul to deliver a speech pre-approved by the Romney camp .

"THE shocking testimonies of four women who accuse the late  Sir Jimmy Savile of sexually abusing them as children can be revealed today. The Mail on Sunday has been given an exclusive preview of an explosive 55-minute ITV documentary to be screened on Wednesday. In Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile, in which the women, now all middle-aged, offer compelling accounts of how they were groomed by Savile for sex when they were teenagers. Shocking testimonies: Four women, now all middle-aged, have offered compelling accounts of how they were groomed by Jimmy Savile, pictured, for sex when they were teenagers in an ITV documentary . The documentary also features damning contributions from former BBC production staff who reveal that the star’s predatory behaviour with girls as young as 12 was an open secret. And a child protection expert who investigated the claims for ITV tells the programme he is convinced Savile, who died last year, would face arrest if still alive. Mark Williams-Thomas, who for 12 years was a detective and child protection officer, spent a year talking to Savile’s former victims. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They were in awe of an individual who could give them a great number of benefits, and so the abuse could go on and on unchecked. The women thought no one would believe them then, and even now they are terrified of the potential backlash from his fans and from his estate. But I have no doubt that on the evidence I have gathered, if Savile was still alive I would be banging on his door to get him nicked.’ 'He was all over me': 14-year-old Coleen Nolan (pictured with Savile on Top Of The Pops in 1979) said she was horrified when he intimately cuddled her on the show . Mr Williams-Thomas was a child . protection officer with Surrey Police and worked on the prosecution of . pop impresario Jonathan King on charges of sex with underage boys. Since leaving the police, he has become a consultant on child protection and fronted the ITV documentary To Catch A Paedophile. He said: ‘Early last year I was asked by a contact if I was aware of allegations that had circulated for years about Savile and young girls and if I knew of an investigation into a complaint made to Surrey police in 2007. 'He put his hand up my skirt. There were dozens of times after that. When I was 16 it turned into full sex.' Val, 15, Top Of The Pops 1968 . ‘When Savile died, I began an investigation and was put in contact with several women who alleged they had been abused by him.’ He . has learned that at least two complaints were made to Surrey Police . about Savile while he was alive, though the force refuses to say whether . he was formally interviewed. The . shocking conclusion of his investigation is that Savile, who was the . face of Top Of The Pops for three decades as well as Jim’ll Fix It, . groomed girls as young as 12 for sex. Savile’s victims tell strikingly similar stories in the documentary, which is to be screened at 11pm – two hours after the watershed. Explosive: The documentary claims that Savile, who famously presented the first ever Top of the Pops, gave young girls money and cigarettes in return for 'sexual favours' Until his death at 84, Savile was . seen as an outlandish but avuncular star who loved tracksuits and . ostentatious jewellery. But despite his tireless charity work, he never . escaped dark rumours about his lifestyle. The ITV investigation makes . concrete allegations for the first time. One . woman identified in the programme only as ‘Val’ met Savile on Top Of . The Pops in 1968 when she was 15. She says: ‘He got me into an alcove in . his dressing room and pushed me against the wall. He put his hand up my . skirt. 'He invited me to his hotel and before I knew it he had me on the bed and was having sex. It was repulsive what he was doing to me and other girls.' Angie, 15, Top Of The Pops 1968 . ‘There were dozens . of times after that when I met him. He’d pin me up against a wall, a . corridor, wherever he could he’d grab an opportunity. When I was 16 one . of these occasions turned into full sex. ‘He . kept saying he wouldn’t go the whole way but when I tried to push him . off he held me down with his body weight. I later discovered he’d given . me a sexually transmitted disease.’ She adds: ‘I was very young and he was . a charismatic and powerful personality. There was an air about him that . he had power and contacts and you didn’t want to mess with him.’ Another woman, ‘Angie’, tells a . similar tale of meeting Savile on Top Of The Pops in 1968, also aged 15. ‘He invited me to come round to his hotel and before I knew it he had . me on the bed and was having sex with me. ‘He . had a little couch in his dressing room and we’d have sex there or . sometimes he’d pin me up against the wall. It was all very unemotional . on his part. I was a teenager and very naive and I blamed myself for . what he did.’ Had he been alive: Savile, who died last year, would have faced arrest if still alive, a child protection expert claims on the documentary . Wilfred De’Ath was a young . Oxford-educated BBC producer working on radio talk show Teen Scene when . he first encountered Savile. Mr De’Ath, now 75, appears on the ITV . programme and was also interviewed by The Mail on Sunday. He said he was . stunned when Savile invited him to a Chinese restaurant called The . Lotus House, a popular celebrity haunt in London, where he found the DJ . sitting on a banquette with a young girl. ‘He . told me he had met the girl – who was small and waif-like – on Top Of . The Pops the night before. She was very young, I’d say near to 12. 'I remember the teacher introducing me and saying, ""Be nice to uncle Jimmy"". I was told to sit on his lap and I felt his hand go up my jumper.' Charlotte, Duncroft schoolgirl 1974 . ‘Savile . arranged to meet me in a London hotel called The Mascot, which was a . very seedy place off Baker Street, the next day. When I called up to his . room he told me that he was in bed with the girl I’d met the night . before and he even got her to talk to me on the phone. I remember her . saying, “Hello Mr Producer”. I didn’t want to carry on talking. ‘I told him he was living incredibly . dangerously and he replied, “No, no, no, I’m far too valuable to the BBC . for anything to happen to me”. ‘It appeared to be generally accepted . that he was usually in the company of young girls. I know it sounds . cowardly, but there was the feeling that if I grassed to the top end of . the BBC then I would have been out.’ Another . BBC employee, Sue Thompson, was a production assistant on TV show . Speakeasy in 1978 when she encountered Savile with a girl she believes . was 14. Former detective Mark Williams-Thomas approached Esther to look at interviewed women who say Savile sexually abused them . ‘As I walked into his dressing room, . he was sitting in a chair with the girl on his knee. His left arm was . resting on her leg and he was kissing her. There was no doubt in my mind . it was a sexual advance.’  In January it emerged that a probe by BBC2’s . Newsnight into allegations about Savile had been shelved. There were . suspicions of a cover-up, but Newsnight editor Peter Rippon told The . Mail on Sunday it was dropped for editorial reasons. ‘We were pursuing a . particular angle which we were unable to substantiate,’ he said. Singer Coleen Nolan, who does not appear . in the ITV programme, revealed four years ago that she was horrified . when Savile intimately cuddled her in 1979 on Top Of The Pops when she . was 14. She said: ‘He was all over me. I could see my sisters glaring, . “You touch her and we’ ll kill you!” – and they would have done.’ In 2007, Surrey Police received . complaints that Savile had abused pupils at the now defunct Duncroft . Approved School for Girls near Staines, for which he did charity work in . the Seventies. The investigation was dropped after a Crown Prosecution . Service lawyer advised no further action be taken. In ITV’s documentary two ex-Duncroft . pupils talk about Savile. One, Charlotte, recalls being introduced to . him in a caravan in the grounds in 1974. ‘The teacher told me to sit on . his lap and then I felt his hand go up my jumper. I shouted at him, . “What do you think you are doing?” and the next thing I knew I was . dragged out of the caravan by two of the staff. ‘I was told that Savile did nothing but good for the school and that I needed to apologise. I was put into isolation for three days.’","Jim'll Fix It star alleged to have given girls cash, cigarettes and records in return for 'sexual favours'

"BBC Chairman Lord Patten today publicly criticised an extraordinary attempt to gag a Cabinet minister appearing on one of its highest profile current affairs programmes as the Jimmy Savile scandal deepened. An email leaked to the Daily Mail reveals Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps was warned against raising damaging allegations against the corporation hours before an appearance on Question Time just days ago. Lord Patten said the email was 'misleading' and expressed in 'unfortunate' language. He said he could understand why Mr Shapps and made a complaint. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps was warned against raising damaging allegations against the corporation hours before an appearance on Question Time . Amid increasing acrimony between the . Government and the BBC over its handling of the Savile affair, Mr Shapps . yesterday made a formal complaint to Lord Patten. He said the corporation had been ‘trying to provide guidance for an elected representative appearing on a BBC opinion show -  guidance which in the event has turned out to be wholly inaccurate’. The complaint from Mr Shapps suggesting . the BBC was trying to quash criticism on its own outlets will heighten . tensions between the corporation and the Government. A BBC message, sent to the . Conservative chairman on October 11 as the corporation was fighting to . contain the Savile revelations, insisted claims Newsnight had scrapped . an investigation into the affair because of internal pressure were . ‘malicious’. Mr Shapps was told by the BBC’s head . of public affairs Julia Ockenden: ‘No pressure was applied to drop this . investigation. None. To suggest otherwise is to risk impugning the . professional reputation and integrity of a number of journalists.’ She . went on to insist that to suggest the Newsnight expose of Savile was . dropped for any reason other than the claims against the presenter could . not be substantiated was ‘false and very damaging to the BBC and . individuals’. Any allegation that any evidence had been withheld from police was ‘also damaging and false’, the minister was warned. The email was sent to Tory party chairman Grant Shapps by Julia Ockenden, head of public affairs at the BBC . The email referred Mr Shapps to a . blog written by Newsnight editor Peter Rippon explaining the decision . not to broadcast claims against Savile. The BBC has since admitted that key elements of Mr Rippon’s defence were inaccurate. For . instance, the claim that no evidence was withheld from police has been . shown to be false, since some of Savile’s victims who were interviewed . for the aborted Newsnight investigation had not in fact spoken to . detectives. Today Lord Patten said: 'I’ve said in . reply to him that if I’d been in his position would have felt much the . same and would have written the same sort of letter. 'I think there are two points he made . in that letter. The first was it’s wrong for the BBC to give a briefing . about its corporate position. I’m not sure I’d agree with that. 'But the fact that it was misleading - . that’s what was wrong. I also think the terms in which it was expressed . were unfortunate.' Newsnight editor Peter Rippon explained the decision not to broadcast claims against Savile in a blog post . Mr Shapps told the Daily Mail he had . attempted to pass the email to an inquiry being headed by former Sky . News chief Nick Pollard, who has been asked by the BBC to investigate . whether inappropriate managerial pressure was applied to prevent . disclosure of the allegations against Savile. Incredibly, . however, he said had been told the inquiry was not considering any . evidence from external sources – prompting him to complain to Lord . Patten. ‘I received the email on the evening . that I appeared on Question Time. It was sent just a couple of hours . before the show was recorded, and as a result I did not see it before I . went on,’ Mr Shapps wrote to the BBC chairman. ‘However, . in light of… subsequent admissions made by the BBC concerning Jimmy . Savile and Newsnight, I think it is important to raise the contents of . the email with you. ‘I believe that in light of these admissions, the content of Ms Ockenden's email was misleading; deliberately or otherwise.' David Cameron said the BBC had 'serious questions' to answer about how Savile (pictured) was able to get away with the abuse for so long . Mr Shapps' letter added: 'I’m . concerned that this amounted to the BBC trying to provide guidance for . an elected representative appearing on a BBC opinion show - guidance . which in the event has turned out to be wholly inaccurate. ‘I . had wished to submit this information for the consideration of the . Pollard Review, but am further concerned that the investigation is not . taking external representations.  I hope that you are therefore able to . alert the appropriate BBC review to my concerns.’ Mr . Shapps told the Mail: ‘Given what we now know about this situation, . this email raises further serious concerns about the BBC’s handling of . this affair, even after the facts started to become apparent.’ Senior Tories are furious that Lord . Patten has suggested Culture Secretary Maria Miller was threatening the . independence of the BBC by expressing concern about the way the BBC has . responded to revelations of Savile’s paedophile activities. MP Sir Roger Gale, a former BBC . journalist, accused the ‘out of touch’ BBC chairman of ‘arrogance’ – and . became the first politician to suggest that the scandal may force the . resignation of both Lord Patten and BBC director-general George . Entwistle. At Prime . Minister’s Questions, David Cameron said the BBC had ‘serious questions’ to answer about how Savile was able to get away with the abuse for so . long, adding that he did not rule out ‘further steps’ in addition to the . inquiries already under way. Philip Davies, a Conservative member . of the culture, media and sport select committee, said the email . to Mr Shapps suggested the BBC had been more concerned with protecting its own . reputation than establishing the truth. ‘I’m sure that what Julia Ockenden . sent was what she genuinely believed to be the case, and that was the . message from the senior echelons of the BBC,’ he said. ‘But actually if the BBC had spent . more time getting to the bottom of the situation and less than worrying . about news management, they wouldn’t find themselves in such a mess at . the moment. ‘Their priority in all of this was . reputation management. That’s what I’m afraid was pretty clear from our . session today – that even the director-general has made a pretty . lamentable effort to find out what has gone on.’ The BBC has since admitted that key elements of Mr Rippon's defence were inaccurate . A BBC spokesman insisted the message had also been sent to the other MPs on the Question Time panel, Labour’s Caroline Flint and deputy Liberal Democrat leader Simon Hughes. ‘The BBC’s head of public affairs was simply doing her job of keeping MPs of all parties across BBC issues that could come up on the programme. As we have clarified, the BBC regrets that the explanation given by the Newsnight editor in his blog was inaccurate or incomplete in some respects,’ the spokesman added. In a letter to Lord Patten, Mrs Miller said Mr Entwistle's evidence to Parliament and the BBC's handling of the wider scandal raised ‘very real concerns’ about public trust. The BBC chairman’s reply contained a thinly veiled warning that the Government should not wade into the row. ‘I know that you will not want to give any impression that you are questioning the independence of the BBC,’ he wrote. But Conservative MP Sir Roger, a former producer and director of current affairs programmes at the BBC, said Lord Patten had made clear that he was ‘out of touch, not only with the strength of feeling and concern in Parliament about the Savile affair and related matters but, more importantly, with the strength of public revulsion at what has happened at Television Centre and with the corporate culture that, for the best part of 40 years, has apparently covered it up’. ‘Attack may be the best form of defence but in seeking to criticise a Culture Secretary who has not ever sought to challenge the independence of the BBC, he indicates how very little, within that corporate arrogance, has really changed,’ he added. ‘The 'Auntie knows best' line simply does not wash any more. ‘BBC management, over far too many years, has sought to maintain an imperious disdain for criticism and it has become clear that successive directors general have, while happy to criticise others for not answering difficult questions, either turned a blind eye to criminal activities or have not known what has been going on on their own doorstep, which is also culpable. ‘It is as if your favourite and respectable aunt has been revealed to be on the game, and if Lord Patten is not able to grasp that, then I fear that not only the director general but also the chairman of the BBC Trust are going to have to fall on their swords.’","Tory party chairman Grant Shapps was told by producers he could not mention allegations about why Newsnight dropped its Jimmy Savile report .

"Kato Kaelin, a star witness at the O.J. Simpson trial, has backtracked saying that he never confirmed  the disgraced former football star killed his ex-wife. In a recent interview, Kaelin, who gave . evidence for four days in front of millions glued to their TVs, said . Simpson was guilty of butchering Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend . Ronald Goldman - but that he was 'too scared' to say so during the 1994 . hearing. However Kato has now flip-flopped on these reported statements and told TMZ: 'I would never say something like this... I have no first hand knowledge.' He said he was shocked by the interview with the New York Post and that it did not take place. Change of tune: Kato Kaelin testified during the O.J. Simpson trial in 1995 (left). Right, pictured ahead of a 2011 press conference . Sensational trial: Nicole Brown Simpson was suspected of being killed by ex-husband O.J. Simpson in Los Angeles, California, in June 1995 . Kaelin allegedly told the New York Post’s Cindy Adams: 'The statute of limitations has now passed... so I can now say... yes, he did it.' Asked why he let Simpson get away with it, he said: 'I was too scared. I was terrified.' The bodies of Brown Simpson and Goldman were found at her home, the victims of a vicious knife attack in front of her Los Angeles condominium. Over the years, Kaelin's claims implied that O.J. Simpson could know more details about the case that have not yet become public. Victim: Ronald Goldman was found murdered along with his friend Nicole Brown Simpson in 1994 . Simpson starred in dozens of film and TV roles both during and after his NFL career, and was most famous for his three-film stint as Detective Nordberg in the 'Naked Gun' series. For 17 years, doubt has hung over his innocence despite the acquittal, and a $33.5million civil case later found him liable for her death and the death of Goldman. At the trial, Kaelin, a small-time actor and Simpson's house-guest on the night of the killing, became an oddball celebrity after his rambling testimony about Simpson's movements and some background information. He was lampooned on TV shows for his long hair, laid-back surfer demeanor and for being an unemployed layabout. Critics claim that he held back from telling the jury about Simpson’s bouts of rage or his possessiveness of his ex-wife. His . testimony was so inconsistent that at one point, prosecutor Marcia . Clark asked for permission from Judge Lance to to treat him as a . hostile witness. He then admitted that Simpson had acted 'upset' in the hours before his ex-wife and Goldman were killed. Not guilty: Simpson celebrates his verdict with his lawyers Robert Kardashian, left, and Johnnie Cochrane, right . Simpson is currently serving in a Nevada prison for his role in a Las Vegas robbery case. He was convicted of being the leader . of an armed group that raided a hotel room at the Palace Station hotel . in 2007 and robbed a pair of sports memorabilia dealers. Though . Simpson said that he was only taking back what was rightfully his and . claimed no weapons were used, he was sentenced to 33 years in jail on . October 8, 2008 - 13 years to the day of his 1995 acquittal. Many saw the especially harsh sentence as retribution for getting off scot-free in the killings. Bronco chase: Simpson, in a white Ford Bronco, is pursued by the LAPD shortly after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman in the infamous photo . Celebration: O.J. Simpson (C) cheers while standing with his attorneys F. Lee Bailey (L) and Johnnie Cochan Jr (R), after hearing the not guilty verdict in his criminal murder trial . The Simpson case recently returned to the headlines when one of the original prosecutors alleged that the lead defense lawyer tampered with a crucial piece of evidence. Former Los Angeles deputy district attorney Christopher Darden accused the late Johnnie Cochran of 'manipulating' one of the infamous gloves that the prosecution said linked Simpson to the crime. After Simpson struggled to fit the gloves on his hands - in one of the defining moments of the racially-charged trial that captivated the nation - Cochran famously admonished the jury: 'If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.' 'If the glove don't fit...': O.J. Simpson holds up his hands to the jury wearing the infamous gloves found at the crime scene and at his home during the murder trial . Following Simpson’s acquittal Kaelin, 53, skirted around the edges of celebrity and became a failed reality TV star, appearing in shows like 'Celebrity Boot Camp.' He filmed episodes of a series called 'House Guest' in which he would stay in the homes of various celebrities, but the show never saw the light of day. Kaelin also appeared as a contestant on quiz shows and briefly worked in radio. O.J. Simpson was sentenced on 12 charges, including felony kidnapping, armed robbery and conspiracy related to a 2007 confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel . O.J. Simpson: A former football star whose career spanned 11 seasons with the Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers. He had turned to acting both during and after his football career, and his most famous role was as Detective Nordberg in the ‘Naked Gun’ films opposite Leslie Nielson. He was famously acquitted of the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1995, but ordered to pay their families 33.5million in damages in a subsequent wrongful death civil trial. On October 8, 2008 - 13 years to the day of his 1995 acquittal, he was found guilty in a Las Vegas armed robbery case and sentenced to 33 years in jail. He will be eligible for parole in 2017. Judge Lance Ito: Ito worked in the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office before he was appointed to the job of Superior Court judge in 1989. But he wasn’t internationally recognised until he sat on the bench at the O.J. Simpson murder trial. He regularly declines invitations to be interviewed about the case. Today, Ito continues to hold the post of Superior Court judge. The LA Times reported in 2009 that Ito's notoriety because of the Simpson case prompted thieves to repeatedly steal the placard bearing his name from outside the courtroom so often that Ito will no longer replace it. Johnnie Cochran: While many figures of the O.J. Simpson trial became national figures in the trial itself, Cochran was already notorious in California as a skilled lawyer with a wide variety of celebrity clients to his name. Among them were Michael Jackson, rapper Tupac Shakur and Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs. Cochran also represented police brutality victim Abner Louima in New York. He famously uttered the term 'If the glove don't fit, you must acquit' to jurors during the Simpson trial in reference to the bloody glove found at the murder scene. In the hit TV show Seinfeld, Cosmo Kramer’s attorney Jackie Chiles is loosely based on Cochran. Cochrane died of a brain tumor in 2005. Marcia Clark: Clark was active for several years as a prosecutor before she unsuccessfully tried to put Simpson away in 1995 for the murder of Brown Simpson and Goldman. She penned a book about the Simpson case, called Without a Doubt, in 1997. It was released right after she resigned as a prosecutor. Last year, she was back on TV to provide legal analysis for Healdine News on the trial of Casey Anthony, the Florida mother who was accused of murdering her young daughter Caylee. In a 2011 Daily Beast column she wrote after Anthony's murder acquittal, Clark branded her 'Worse Than OJ!' Robert Kardashian: Before his children Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob Kardashian became fixtures on reality television, Robert Kardashian was Simpson's close friend and lawyer during his murder trial. His ex-wife Kris (who later went on to marry Olympics icon Bruce Jenner) was equally as close with Nicole Brown Simpson. O.J. stayed in Kardashian's home in the days after the murder - just before the famous Ford Bronco chase. He joined Simpson's defense team despite not having practiced law in several years. Kardashian, who was married three times, was just 59 years old when he died of esophageal cancer in 2003. Robert Shapiro: Another one of Simpson’s high-priced attorneys, Robert Shapiro has a long list of celebrity clients to his name - from athletes like Jose Canseco and Darryl Strawberry to TV stars like Johnny Carson and the Kardashian family. In 2001, he co-founded the online legal documentation site LegalZoom.com. He also stepped into the fashion realm in 2009 when he co-founded ShoeDazzle.com. He continues to represent clients like Eva Longoria and casino tycoon Steve Wynn. Mark Fuhrman: The LA detective who was branded a liar and racist by O.J. Simpson’s defense team may no longer be on the force, but he's still keeping busy. Several years after the O.J. Simpson trial, Fuhrman published a book about the long-unsolved murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut. Fuhrman alleged that the killer was Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel. In 2002, Skakel was convicted of the crime and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. Fuhrman now provides crime commentary for Fox News.","Original testimony was so much on Simpson’s side that the prosecution labelled him a hostile witness .

I will get back to you. Cooper told Smith that the administration could at least keep her apprised of the investigation, and she agreed, saying: 'That would be so nice. That would at least acknowledge that I have a right to know something, something other than, we're checking up on it, or trust me. 'I like that one the best of all. Trust me. I will let you know. 'Well, I don't trust you anymore. I don't trust you anymore. You - I'm not going to say lied to me, but you didn't tell me and you knew.' The State Department says it never concluded that the attack was simply a protest gone awry. Meanwhile . the investigating committee's chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., . has accused the State Department of turning aside pleas from its . diplomats in Libya to increase security in the months and weeks before . the attack. One scheduled . witness, Eric Nordstrom, the former chief security officer for U.S. diplomats in Libya, told the committee his pleas for more security were . ignored. Department . officials were asked about the administration's initial - and since . retracted - explanation linking the violence to protests over an . American-made anti-Muslim video circulating on the Internet. One official responded 'that was not our conclusion' and called it a question for 'others' to answer, without specifying to whom he was referring. The burn-out wreckage following the fires within the U.S. Consulate . The . officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't . authorized to speak publicly on the matter, and provided no evidence . that might suggest a case of spontaneous violence or angry protests that . went too far. Republican presidential candidate . Mitt Romney and Republican lawmakers have increasingly sharpened their . criticism of the administration's initial explanation of the attack. They said they never accepted the original explanation. It . was a top administration diplomatic official, United Nations Ambassador . Susan Rice, who gave a series of interviews five days after the attack . that wrongly described the attack as spontaneous. She . said that the administration believed the violence was unplanned and . that extremists with heavier weapons 'hijacked' the protest against the . anti-Islamic video. Governor Mitt Romney pointed the finger at Obama's administration for wrongly describing the attack as 'spontaneous' She did . qualify her remarks to say that was the best information she had at the . time. Rice since has denied trying to mislead Congress. A . concurrent CIA memo obtained by The Associated Press cited intelligence . suggesting the demonstrations in Benghazi 'were spontaneously inspired . by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo' and 'evolved into a direct . assault' on the diplomatic posts by 'extremists'. Nordstrom, . the former security official in Libya, addressed the diplomatic . security issue in an October 1 email to a congressional investigator. He . said his requests for more security were blocked by a department policy . to 'normalise operations and reduce security resources'. A . memo on Tuesday by the Oversight Committee's Democratic staff provided . details of Nordstrom's interview with the panel's investigators. In . that interview, Nordstrom said he sent two cables to State Department . headquarters in March 2012 and July 2012 requesting additional . diplomatic security agents for Benghazi, but he received no responses. He . stated that Charlene Lamb, the deputy assistant secretary for . international programs, wanted to keep the number of U.S. security . personnel in Benghazi artificially low. He . said Lamb believed the Benghazi facilities did not need any diplomatic . security special agents because there was a residential safe haven to . fall back to in an emergency. Nordstrom's . October 1 memo to the congressional investigator said: 'You will note . that there were a number of incidents that targeted diplomatic missions . and underscored the GoL's (government of Libya) inability to secure and . protect diplomatic missions. 'This . was a significant part of (the diplomatic) post's and my argument for . maintaining continued DS (diplomatic security) and DOD (Department of . Defense) security assets into Sept/Oct. 2012 - the GoL was overwhelmed . and could not guarantee our protection.

"The number of pets being abandoned has risen by 65 per cent as owners struggle to afford to look after them, the RSPCA said. Despite the recession being over, animals are still facing ‘dark times’ as 40,595 animals were abandoned in 2011 compared to 24,638 in 2007. The charity is also struggling, finding it harder to rehome abandoned pets and responding to more than 25,000 calls a week from the public. 'Dark times': The number of abandoned pets has soared by 65 per cent as owners struggle to afford looking after them and the RSPCA predicts a further 6,000 dogs and cats will be abandoned from now until the end of the year . The charity’s running costs have risen by 8 per cent from £111million to £120million since 2007 as the average cost of a stay for the animals is on the rise and the number of adoptions is at an all-time low. RSPCA chief executive Gavin Grant said: ‘The recession may be over but these are very dark times for its silent victims, the animals. 'They have never needed our help so desperately. ‘Preventing cruelty and helping the animals most in need are the RSPCA's absolute priorities but the number of abused and abandoned animals is soaring.’ Costly cats: The RSPCA running costs have risen as they struggled to rehome a growing number of cats and dogs with the average stay for a cat at 59 days, four more days than last year . There has also been a 23.5 per cent rise in cruelty convictions in the past year. The first nine months of this year alone have seen 1,176 cruelty convictions involving work by the RSPCA, a 6 per cent rise on the same period in 2011, which saw 1,108 convictions. In crisis: RSPCA chief executive Gavin Grant said the charity is struggling to cope and is appealing to the public for donations . As the number of animals in need grows, . welfare expenditure by the RSPCA, which relies entirely on public . donations, is already exceeding forecasts set for 2012. Mr Grant said: ‘We have more animal abusers to investigate, prosecute and hopefully prevent from hurting animals than anyone can remember.’ The charity is predicting a further 6,000 dogs and cats will be abandoned between now and the end of the year at a cost of nearly £5m. The charity said it is finding it harder to rehome abandoned pets, with 12,711 dogs rehomed in 2011, compared with 16,659 in 2009. In 2011 only 29,880 cats were re-homed, fewer than the 36,070 cats who found new owners two years earlier. The average stay for a dog in the year so far is 59 days, five more than last year and their average cost of stay has risen from £810 to £885. Cats have also averaged stays of 59 days this year - four more days than in 2011 - and the average cost of their stay has risen to £554.60 from £517. Mr Grant today called for emergency help from the nation's animal lovers. He said: ‘This is a real crisis and despite the immense dedication of our staff and volunteers, we are struggling to cope. ‘We really need our country's animal lovers to step forward and open their hearts, homes and purses in these extremely difficult times.’ DOG (average life expectancy 12 years)                  CAT (average life expectancy 14 years) Daily 80g tin of dog food £3,504                                    Daily 60g tin of cat food £3,066 .

"DUTCH GO MAN-TO-MAN WITH MESSI . Nigel de Jong was only just returning from injury, but clearly Louis van Gaal told him to take care of Lionel Messi. Whenever Messi came into De Jong’s midfield area, he was never more than a few yards from the striker, putting him under pressure. De Jong did well for an hour but man-marking is a dying art and I’m not sure there’s room for it in the modern game. To stay tight you have to forget about being in possession but that badly affects team shape. Scroll down for videos... Forward charge: Nigel de Jong tries to hold back Lionel Messi as the Argentine wizard tries to launch an attack . Head-to-head: Nigel de Jong against Lionel Messi was one of the important tussles of the match . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi highlights . GAME ROBBED OF ROBBEN . Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie were both quiet, but Robben in particular looked very isolated. He had just six touches in the first half and two of those were throw-ins. He has been one of the most exciting players to watch in the tournament so it was frustrating to see him far from his best. He improved in the second half but credit Argentina for keeping him quiet. Flying Dutchman: Arjen Robben is sent tumbling by a slide challenge during the ill-tempered semi-final . Hauled down: Arjen Robben is fouled by Martin Demichelis as he tries to break through into space . After Germany’s sensational win over Brazil, this game was disappointing.  I thought Holland would do well thanks to their organisation, but Argentina were better than I expected. Both teams worked hard to deny the star men space and it led to a rather uninspiring game. It did not help that the referee let plenty of fouls go unpunished. That meant players could put in some tough tackles but still get away with it. Nasty: Georginio Wijnaldum raises his boot to Javier Mascherano after the Argentina man heads the ball clear, one of many moment of aggression in the match . 50-50: Daryl Janmaat and Lucas Biglia go for the ball at the same time, resulting in a tangle of legs . SPEEDY LAVEZZI LOOKED LIVELY . Most of the focus before the match was on Messi, but Argentina’s best attacking outlet was Ezequiel Lavezzi. I’ve been impressed with him at Paris Saint-Germain and his speed causes defenders problems.

"A British Muslim, who married his second wife in a secret sharia ceremony, has been sentenced to life in jail for stabbing her to death in a ‘merciless’ attack. Siraj Arif, 31, knifed Saiba Khatoon – who was 19-weeks pregnant – with such ferocity that two of the three kitchen knives he used snapped under the force of the blows in the row over their unborn baby. Ms Khatoon’s seven-year-old son Farris, from a previous marriage, was woken by the noise and found his mother covered in blood, Manchester Crown Court heard. 'Awful circumstances': Saiba Khatoon (pictured centre with friends Sandra and Elisha Barnes) was stabbed to death by husband Siraj Arif in a 'merciless' attack . Jailed for life: Two of three kitchen knives Arif used in the attack snapped under the force of the blows . Arif, from Smallbridge near Rochdale, had wed Ms Khatoon, 26, in a secret Islamic ceremony despite already being married for ten years. His other wife, with whom he had three children, had given consent to the polygamous ceremony under sharia law and Ms Khatoon was said to be happy to be his ‘second wife’ while her family disapproved of their relationship. When Farris discovered his mother in a pool of blood in her house in Rochdale, Greater Manchester and alerted neighbours, shouting: ‘My mum, my mum.’ She was found lying in the kitchen with a number of broken knives and their handles lying around her. After the killing in May, Arif rang 999 . and told police: ‘I had a fight, she picked a knife up and she told me . she was going to kill my baby. ‘She told me either I’m going to kill the baby or kill you. ‘I ended up grabbing the knife and shoving it in her. That’s what I did.’ Tests revealed she had been stabbed 15 times. In . sentencing Judge Michael Henshell said: ‘The attack was not only severe . but must have been sustained as shown by the three separate knives used . as one knife broke it was replaced and the attack continued. ‘It was a merciless, sustained attack on a woman in her own home whilst her seven-year-old son was in the house. ‘We cannot be sure if he saw the attack . but he saw the aftermath and the memory of that will live with him for . most of his life, without a mother, who died in awful circumstances.’ Son woken by attack: Ms Khatoon's seven-year-old son was woken by the noise and discovered his mother lying in the kitchen of her house in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, covered in blood . Arif started his life in jail sentence today after he pleaded guilty to murder. He was ordered to serve a minimum of 21 years. The court heard that Ms Khatoon had met Arif when she was a teenager and had a relationship with him which ended in 2003. Ms Khatoon then met and married Dr Anwar in Pakistan. The couple returned to the UK in 2004 and Farris was born in 2005. Kim Hollis QC, prosecuting, said: ‘All . seemed to be well and happy on the surface but whilst Dr Anwar was in . Pakistan she bumped into the defendant again in 2009 at a cousin’s . wedding. 'Under pressure': The court heard that Arif was under considerable pressure and that the attack 'was out of character and he snapped' ‘He was by now married and as some stage their relationship reignited.’ Dr Anwar discovered the affair and the . couple divorced in 2010. He moved out and Arif began visiting her at . home despite Ms Khatoon’s sisters Salma, Sarah Ali and Riswana . disapproving of her relationship with him. Sarah Ali and a friend had . even approached Arif’s first wife about their concerns. But the lovers ‘married’ under sharia law although Ms Khatoon concealed the marriage from her family because . of their disapproval. Disapproved of the relationship: Ms Khatoon's family and friends (pictured at Manchester Crown Court yesterday) disapproved of her relationship with Arif, whom she married in a secret sharia ceremony . On the night of the attack Arif said in one call to police at 2.19am said: ‘I know the police are looking for me, no one else is in danger.’ He then called again at 4.04 am and gave . his name saying: ‘The police are looking for me. I think it has been a . bit longer I might be running a bit late. Whatever has happened has . happened, I don’t even know what has happened.’ Ms Khatoon was said to be happy to be Arif's second wife while he remained married to his first wife with whom he had three children . He later broke down in tears to a work colleague telling him: ‘I’m finished I have done something wrong. I’m f***ed.’ He asked for a taxi to the police station but gave himself up when he spotted a police car en route. In mitigation, defence counsel Anthony Hayden QC said: ‘He is a man who has worked hard all his life which makes what happened so much more difficult to understand. ‘When asked about the relationship with Saiba he said their relationship was fine and they would see each other for a few hours in the day. ‘They didn’t argue and there wasn’t violence and she didn’t mind at the prospect of being a second wife. ‘This day he was under considerable pressure and had been drinking and taking cannabis to relieve stress. It was out of character and he snapped.’ After the case Senior Investigating Officer Andy Tattersall from Greater Manchester Police said: ‘This was a brutal attack on a woman he professed to love. ‘She was pregnant with her second child and was looking forward to becoming a mother again. She leaves behind a son, who will now grow up without his mum. ‘Saiba was a popular woman and her murder has deeply affected all of her family and many friends.’ In a victim impact statement Sarah Ali said: ‘Saiba did not deserve to die. ‘Our happy life has been turned upside down by one violent act. Saiba will always be lover and never forgotten. ‘She had a lot of love to give and was taken away too soon.’","Siraj Arif stabbed Saiba Khatoon 15 times and was sentenced to life in jail .

"A police officer who was sacked after he dragged a female prisoner across a station floor and threw her headfirst into a cell must get his job back, a High Court judge has ruled. Mark Andrews was jailed in 2010 for assaulting Pamela Someville, 60, before having his conviction quashed on appeal shortly afterwards. But despite his acquittal Wiltshire Police still wanted him to lose his job, however, the High Court has today ordered he is reinstated. During his trial CCTV footage was shown of the 6ft 3in policeman . dragging 5ft 2in Ms Somerville, who weighs 8st, across a custody suite, . throwing her into a cell and leaving her unconscious. The footage then shows her bleeding heavily from an eye gash with blood shooting onto the floor. Scroll down for video . Battle: Sergeant Mark Andrews (left) will be allowed back to work after he threw Pamela Somerville (right)  into a cell but his assault conviction was quashed and Wiltshire Police cannot stop him returning . CCTV: The Wiltshire Police video showed the sergeant throwing his prisoner headfirst, leaving her with bad cuts and bruises . In his judgment Mr Justice Ouseley said . his order must now be followed by the force 'with full regard to its . conclusions, and the failure of this unarguable challenge'. Wiltshire Police's chief constable Pat Geenty confirmed they would not take any further legal action to block his return to the £36,000 a year job. 'I will now enter into discussions with Mark Andrews and his representatives in relation to his integration back into Wiltshire Police as a warranted police officer,' he said. 'The Police Appeals Tribunal accepted that Mark Andrews' actions were intolerant and discreditable and I felt they were a disgrace - there was no place in Wiltshire Police for this behaviour then nor is there now. 'While I believe the Police Discipline Panel's decision to dismiss Mark Andrews was correct, I accept the legal authority which states he must be reinstated.' Controversial: Wiltshire Police CCTV showed Sergeant Mark Andrews dragging Pamela Somerville across the floor of Melksham police station before throwing her into a cell . Ms Somerville had been detained at the police . station in Melksham for failing to provide a sample for a breath test . after being found asleep in her car. The charges were later dropped. Painful: Ms Somerville expressed her disappointment that Sgt Mark Andrews was cleared on appeal of assaulting her in the cells . The case against Andrews was brought after a fellow officer, PC Rachel Webb, reported . the incident to senior officers and gave evidence against Sgt Andrews. He was jailed for six . months in September 2010 by a district judge at Oxford Magistrates' Court, who condemned him for abusing a position of trust. He spent six days in prison before being bailed when a appeal was launched and his conviction was quashed. Despite the conviction being overturned Wiltshire Police sacked the . officer, saying that, while not criminal, his behaviour had fallen 'well . below the standards expected'. Wiltshire Police then asked the High Court to overturn the decision of . the Independent Police Appeals Tribunal which on December 2011 ordered . the force to reinstate Sgt Andrews to his  job and award . him back pay. Speaking then the force said it was 'surprised and disappointed' at the tribunal's ruling. A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said today: 'Wiltshire Police has today been informed that it has not been successful in seeking a judicial review in the Mark Andrews case. 'Wiltshire Police would like to point out that the written judgement levels some criticism at the Chief Constable. It is important to note that this refers to previous Chief Constable Brian Moore and not current Chief Constable Pat Geenty.' Christopher Hoare, of Wiltshire Police Authority, said they would abide by the judgement despite not agreeing with it. 'I clearly remember the impression made by the CCTV images from the Melksham custody suite. 'I stressed at the time that the Police Authority believed that this was an isolated incident which did not reflect the standards we expect of Wiltshire's police officers. 'A Wiltshire Police disciplinary panel decided that dismissal was the appropriate sanction for Mark Andrews. 'An independent Police Appeal Tribunal decided by a majority verdict that he should be re-instated. The Police Authority felt that the public of Wiltshire would expect that decision to be challenged, and so it was. 'However, today the courts have declined to over-rule the Police Appeal Tribunal, meaning that although the maximum fine imposed on Mark Andrews stands, he cannot be dismissed. 'Whilst we may not agree with that, we will abide by the judgement.'","Mark Andrews was jailed in 2010 for assaulting Pamela Someville, 60, but was acquitted on appeal .

"Wayne Rooney's 'stupid' red card on Saturday came about because the Manchester United captain doesn't trust his defence, according to Alan Shearer.

'The problem is, Rooney is trying to do everyone's job to get them out of it. His swing at Stewart Downing was an act of desperation. 'It was not as if Downing was clear through on goal.

"A hapless police officer scrambled a force helicopter after spotting a 'raid' on a scrap metal yard only to find that the suspect was actually a scarecrow wearing a high-visibility jacket. The PC was on the hunt for a gang responsible for a string of metal thefts when he saw a ‘man acting suspiciously’ on top of a pile of scrap. Thinking the suspect was a lookout for the gang, he called for back-up and scrambled the police helicopter to give him aerial support. Who's the dummy, now? A PC scrambled a force helicopter after spotting a 'raid' on a scrap metal yard, but discovered later that the 'suspect' was actually a scarecrow (not pictured) in a high-visibility vest (file images) D'oh! The red-faced PC had to radio HQ to tell them to stand the police helicopter down after his back-up team established that the 'man' was just a dummy (file picture) A specialist team of traffic officers also turned up armed with a high-powered zoom camera, which officers trained on the ‘suspect’ - who was ‘standing his ground’. It was only when traffic officers got a ‘good look’ at the suspect they realised it was a scarecrow, ironically put in place by scrap metal bosses to ward off thieves. The red-faced PC had to radio HQ to tell them to stand the police helicopter down and confirm that a crime was not in progress. The bungle, which took place in Hartlepool last month, was revealed in Police magazine today, but spared the officer his blushes by not naming him. The magazine stated: 'An officer from Hartlepool was investigating a series of thefts from scrap yards. 'The offenders had narrowly escaped the officer several nights previously and he was intent on finding the culprits. Case of mistaken identity: The PC was on the hunt for a gang responsible for a string of metal thefts when he saw a 'man acting suspiciously' on top of a pile of scrap (file picture) 'This led to the officer giving a lot of passing attention to the area over the next few night shifts in an attempt to apprehend the persons responsible. 'Late one night, he was passing the area when he spotted a figure dressed in a high-visibility jacket stood on top of the tip.' The magazine said that the officer believed the man was a ‘lookout’ and was ‘clearly not supposed to be on the site’. It added: 'The officer called for backup from the force helicopter and a traffic unit came to assist with a zoom lens to get a closer look. 'Upon this closer inspection, it was discovered that the lookout was a scarecrow wearing a high-visibility vest.' A spokeswoman for Cleveland Police said: 'We are unable to find details of the incident, or confirm whether it even occurred, as the information published by the magazine does not contain specifics and is from an anonymous source.' 'Crime in Hartlepool is down by 9 per cent thanks to the dedication of our officers.' In Shropshire, two officers found themselves cursing a similar bungle when they were called out to rescue a soaking wet pensioner who turned out to be a scarecrow wearing a straw hat. Two PCs were on their way home from a nightshift in Bridgnorth when a call came in from an off-duty sergeant saying he had spotted a pensioner struggling against the elements during a particularly violent storm. The sergeant told HQ that he had seen the hunched OAP holding a walking stick as he plodded through the driving rain in fields near the village of Alveley at 6.30am, seven miles away from Bridgnorth, last month.

The fuming PCs radioed back to HQ to tell them they were 'going home' and to tell the sarge to 'go to Specsavers', it was revealed in Police magazine.

"Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has praised Paddy McNair ‘tremendous’ debut against West Ham. The 19-year-old defender was thrown into first-team action by Louis van Gaal after injuries to Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans plus suspension for Tyler Blackett. McNair helped United to a 2-1 win at Old Trafford, with the youngster making a crucial headed clearance to deny Enner Valencia in the second half. Paddy McNair made a crucial clearance to deny Enner Valencia (R) on his Manchester United debut . McNair celebrates with Manchester United teammates after securing a 2-1 win against West Ham . ‘That was probably one of the bigger tests a young defender can face, up against a team putting in lots of crosses into the box, but he took it and stood up to it,’ Rooney told the club’s official website. ‘It won’t get much tougher in terms of physical strength and aggression against him, but he dealt with it and we are all delighted with him. ‘I saw the clearance he made at the end. I thought he was tremendous for us. ‘Although we let Tom Cleverley go on loan [to Aston Villa] and Danny Welbeck go to Arsenal, we have brought in a young Manchester lad in Tyler Blackett who played every game until Saturday. ‘The situation was forced on the manager but he has brought Paddy in and it’s shown he isn’t afraid to throw young players in.’ Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Liverpool are hopeful of striking a deal for Marseille teenage prospect Maxime Lopez in the summer despite ongoing interest from Arsenal. The 16-year-old playmaker is rated the brightest prospect in the French club's youth system and that has prompted scouts from Europe's elite clubs to visit the south of France to take a closer look. Lopez has figured against Arsenal in their UEFA Youth League ties but played 24 minutes as a substitute in the first game which Marseille lost 4-1 before pulling the strings in the return in November in a 1-1 draw. Bright prospect: Liverpool and Arsenal are both interested in Marseille's 16-year-old Maxime Lopez (right) Revival: Liverpool could go back in for previous target Yevhen Konoplyanka of Dnipro (right) Swans flying off? Michel Vorm (left) and Ben Davies are being monitored by Liverpool boss Brendan Rogers . Gilles Grimandi has been to watch him again in recent weeks but Liverpool invited Lopez and his family as guests for the Merseyside derby at Anfield. Lopez is understood to have met with Brendan Rodgers and club staff underlined how youngsters are getting a chance to progress into the first team at Liverpool. Rodgers, who has taken Liverpool staff for a sunshine break in Tenerife this week, will be able to attract more top players in the summer if Liverpool continue their impressive Premier League challenge. He remains interested in Swansea duo Ben Davies and Michel Vorm while a deal for Dnipro's Yevhen Konoplyanka could be revived although they are weighing up alternatives. Valencia's 24-year-old midfielder Dani Parejo, who had an ill-fated loan spell at QPR in 2008, has also been watched by Liverpool chief scout Barry Hunter at their recent game with Granada. Sevilla have revived interest in Liverpool midfielder Suso. The 20-year-old has had a moderately successful loan spell in La Liga with Almeria who are struggling to avoid relegation and Sevilla are willing to give him a better platform. Sevilla, who sold Luis Alberto to Liverpool for £7m last summer, are keen to open negotiations on a permanent deal for Suso who was highly coveted as a youngster at Cadiz before he joined Liverpool in 2010. Sevilla sporting director Ramon Rodriguez Verdejo or 'Monchi' is renowned for his ability to revive player's careers and spot new talent and he believes he can help Suso to fulfil his early potential. Suso set to go: The midfielder (right), on loan at Almeria from Liverpool, is interesting Sevilla . Real Madrid are continuing to rival Manchester United for Juventus pair Arturo Vidal and Paul Pogba. Talks between Madrid and Juventus took place yesterday with Juve general manager Beppe Marotta visiting Real Madrid HQ before attending the international friendly between Spain and Italy. Marotta confirmed to Sky Italia: 'Today I did visit Real Madrid, but even if I had spoken about Pogba and Vidal I wouldn’t tell you.' Juventus are among clubs monitoring Robin van Persie's situation at Old Trafford. On Real's radar: Juventus duo Paul Pogba (left) and Arturo Vidal are wanted by Madrid and Manchester United . Manchester City's interest in Victor Wanyama has understandably been welcomed by the Kenya midfielder camp. The 22-year-old joined Southampton from Celtic last summer for £12m after protracted negotiations which prompted his agent Ivan Modia to declare: 'He will not be railroaded into a move that is not right for him.' Despite proving a success in his defensive midfield role, with Southampton conceding only 13 goals while he has been on the pitch in 18 games, Wanyama has taken time to settle on the south coast. His stuttering return from injury this last few weeks has further unnerved him and City will take this into account as they continue to evaluate targets. Welcome interest: Manchester City are looking at Southampton midfielder Victor Wanyama (left) Preferred option: City are also keen on Newcastle's Ivory Coast midfielder Cheick Tiote (right) They are keen to bring in a defensive midfielder and Newcastle's Cheick Tiote remains the preferred option but they will also be wary that he and international team-mate Yaya Toure will be wanted by Ivory Coast for the Africa Cup of Nations next year while Wanyama's Kenya will not qualify. Meanwhile, Manchester City teenage midfielder Bersant Celina is ready to turn his back on Norway to commit his international future to Kosovo. Middlesbrough are facing a battle to hold on to Grant Leadbitter after rival Championship clubs made enquiries to take him on loan this week. Nottingham Forest have a long-standing interest in the 28-year-old midfielder who only has one year left on contract. He is well liked by manager Aitor Karanka who would like to extend his deal but Boro may struggle to compete with greater financial offers from elsewhere. Boro boy: But Championship rivals have enquired about taking Middlesbrough's Grant Leadbitter on loan . Sunderland will rival Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle, Tottenham and Arsenal in the race for Jamaal Lascelles from Nottingham Forest. The 20-year-old defender has impressed again this season and Lee Congerton who is set to become Sunderland's new director of football is understood to be a fan. Hull City have given a trial to West Ham United full back Fraser Shaw. The 19-year-old who was released by Arsenal as a boy has been told he can find a new club. Shaw impressed for Hull reserves on Wednesday in their 5-2 win over Hartlepool United. Derby County defender Kieron Freeman is to join Sheffield United on a month's loan. Freeman impressed for Wales Under 21s against England on Wednesday and has been targeted to provide cover for the injured John Brayford who joined on loan from Cardiff. Aaron Ramsey is expected to sign his new contract at Arsenal by Friday. The Wales midfielder has earned his new deal after Barcelona, Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain all sent scouts to check on his remarkable upturn in form earlier this season. The 23-year-old is due to return to training after being out since Boxing Day with thigh and knee injuries.

"Bosses at the Department for Work and Pensions were today left 'shaken and stirred' after pranksters posted a fake advert for a James Bond-esque 'Target Elimination Specialist' on their Jobcentre website. The spoof recruitment ad appeared on the DirectGov site and stated that the successful applicant should be trained in using sniper rifles, be able to leave foreign countries by non-conventional means and assume new identities. It added that candidates for the MI6 post should be willing to 'remove people' on behalf of the Government and would be equipped with special watches, jet packs and mini-submarines. Spoof! The fake advert for an MI6 'Target Elimination Specialist' appeared on the DirectGov Jobs website on Friday afternoon . Hacked: The advert went on to state that successful candidates would be trained in the use of sniper rifles, mini-submarines and jet packs . The original: Daniel Craig as James Bond, an expert in all the dark arts mentioned in the spoof recruitment advert . It stated the salary was between . £50,000 and £60,000 a year - barely enough to maintain a James . Bond-style lifestyle of Martinis, women and sports cars - though there . would be performance bonuses 'on completion of missions.' A spokeswoman for the DWP confirmed . that a professional killer was not being sought - even though MI6 have . started advertising job vacancies in national magazines - and that the . tongue-in-cheek ad had been removed. The vacancy read: 'From time to time . the UK Government has a need to remove people whose continued existence . poses a risk to the effective conduct of public order. 'So we require particularly skilled . professionals who are prepared to work on a non-attributable basis to . deal with these problems. 'The role will involve international travel to a number of countries where individuals need to be removed.' It continues: 'The ideal candidate . will need to have no particular distinguishing features so as to blend . in and be able to take on new identities as required. Target Elimination: The Department of Work and Pensions confirmed the advert was the work of hackers and had now been taken offline . 'They will need to be resourceful in . finding ways to accomplish their missions and, in some cases, to leave . foreign countries by non-conventional means. 'The role would suit candidates with prior military experience, particularly in the use of sniper rifles.' It adds: 'The job holder will receive . all necessary equipment, including passports, special watches, jet . packs, mini-submarines and a Walther PPK. 'This role is particularly appropriate for those who like their martinis shaken and not stirred. 'To apply for this role, please . express your interest somewhere in the vicinity of the large and rather . fake-looking rock in Regent’s Park.' It then provided a contact email address as mi6recruitment@hotmail.com. New workplace: The 'Target Elimination Specialist' would presumably work out of here, the MI6 HQ near Vauxhall Bridge . The DWP confirmed that an assassin wasn't being sought and that the advert was quickly removed. A spokeswoman said: 'It is disappointing that somebody would want to post a fake advert when people are looking for real jobs. It has now been removed.'

"Care minister Norman Lamb warned the issue of social care could not be left in the 'long grass' A Lib Dem minister has launched a last-minute plea for George Osborne to set aside money to end the scandal of pensioners having to sell their homes to fund sky-high care bills. Norman Lamb, the care services minister, said the issue of social care for the elderly was far too important to be kicked into the ‘long grass’ yet again. In a strongly worded intervention just days before the Coalition launches its mid-term review, he told the Chancellor: ‘We have just got to get on with it.’ Mr Lamb has been joined by three Tory-run councils which have written to David Cameron urging a cap of £35,000 on the amount people have to pay. One of them, Kent County Council, yesterday launched a national petition on the Downing Street website demanding the imposition of a cap. Under England’s current system, pensioners with assets of £23,500 or more – including the value of their homes – have to pay unlimited care charges. It means that every year, at least 20,000 have to sell their homes to pay for care. Two years ago an independent commission led by economist Andrew Dilnot suggested these charges should be subject to a lifetime cap of around £35,000, with the state paying the rest. But Mr Osborne has baulked at the £1.7billion-a-year cost, and there are fears that to reduce the cost to the Treasury, the cap could be set at up to £75,000. Yesterday former care services minister Paul Burstow called for the winter fuel payment, which goes to all pensioners regardless of wealth, to be means tested to free up money for a cap. He said the handout, worth around £200 a year, should be limited to those on pension credit. The money saved would help fund a cap of £60,000. The government is under pressure to commit to the Dilnot Commission reforms to stop people having to sell their homes to pay for care . Mr Burstow said: ‘Social care isn’t free, but it could be a lot fairer for those who have worked hard all their lives.’ Now his successor, Mr Lamb, has joined . the fray. He urged the Government to commit to a cap and work out how . it is paid later on. Former care minister Paul Burstow said radical help was needed to end the 'misery' of huge social care bills . On Monday David Cameron and Nick Clegg will unveil . their mid-term review: the Coalition’s priorities in the run-up to the . next election. Social care is expected to be at its heart. Mr Lamb said: ‘We have just got to get . on with it. We have got to announce it is going to happen, set the cap . and legislate for it in the care and support Bill in the next session.’ Mr Lamb said decisions on how the cap . could be funded – whether through cuts, tax rises or restrictions in . means-tested benefits – could be made later. He added: ‘My absolute determination . is to get the principle in legislation so we have that debate rather . than it remaining in the long grass.’ Meanwhile three Tory councils – Kent, . Hampshire and Buckinghamshire – have written to Mr Cameron calling for a . cap of £35,000 to be imposed by 2015. Paul Carter, leader of Kent County . Council, has also launched a No 10 petition, which needs 100,000 . signatures to force a Commons debate. ‘The system we are currently working . with is simply not up to the job any more,’ he said. ‘I believe that the . whole nation wants the situation sorted out. It’s time to make it . happen.’","Care minister Norman Lamb tells MailOnline the issue of how to fund care for ageing population must be removed from the 'long grass .

"A 27-year-old man killed his South Korean girlfriend whom he had met at a church after a ‘petty quarrel about hair being found down the plug hole’, a court heard today. Daniel Jones allegedly murdered Da In Lee, 22, on Easter Sunday last year and attempted to hide the body under a duvet at his flat in Tipton, West Midlands, before fleeing to Bristol. Jones admitted to his ex-partner that he had killed Miss Lee, who studied international relations and sociology at Aston University in Birmingham, Wolverhampton Crown Court was told. On trial: Daniel Jones (left) allegedly strangled his girlfriend Da In Lee (right) after they argued about her leaving hair down the plug hole - and he then attempted to hide the body under a duvet at his flat in the West Midlands . The information was passed onto police . and officers found Miss Lee's body in Jones's bed on April 9. He . was arrested after police in Bristol found him on board a train heading . to Birmingham. Miss Lee met Jones at a local church . but had ended the relationship days before her death, Gordon Aspden, . prosecuting, told the court. He said: 'At the time of her death Da . In Lee was just 22. She was born and brought up in South Korea which is . the country where her family still resides. 'She was clearly an intelligent young . woman because she travelled half way around the world to the UK in order . to complete her education. ‘She spoke good English and last year . she was mid-way through a degree at Aston University in Birmingham. In . 2011 Da In Lee met Daniel Jones at a church that she attended in south . Birmingham. Murder: The body of Da In Lee was discovered by police at Daniel Jones's flat in the West Midlands last year . ‘The two of them became friendly and . in due course a relationship developed between them. The relationship . gradually began to deteriorate. There were frequent arguments and rows. 'She spent the Saturday night at the . flat with him and there appears to have been an attempt at . reconciliation between them. But swiftly and violently it all went . wrong. By Easter Sunday evening Da In Lee was dead' Gordon Aspden, prosecuting . ‘They would end up shouting insults. Miss Lee eventually finished with this defendant on March 24. Unfortunately later over the Easter weekend Miss Lee returned to the . defendant's flat to see him. 'She spent the Saturday night at the . flat with him and there appears to have been an attempt at . reconciliation between them. But swiftly and violently it all went . wrong. 'By Easter Sunday evening Da In Lee was dead.' Mr Aspden added that when he was being . quizzed by officers, Jones claimed he had killed Miss Lee by accident. He said: 'Jones agreed that around 7pm on Easter Sunday he had killed Da . In Lee. Couple: South Korean Da In Lee met Daniel Jones at church and the pair began a relationship, the court heard . 'He said the background had been a . petty quarrel over household chores and hair being found in the . plughole. The two of them had started pushing each other. ‘He said he had caused her to fall . over and then quickly he got on top of her. He said when Miss Lee had . been underneath him she had struggled and screamed so he put his left . hand over her mouth. ‘He had then taken hold of her throat . with his right hand. He described how her face had gone a purplish blue, . he said he had seen tears well up in her eyes and two tears rolling . down her face. 'He said that when he was applying pressure and she was turning blue he had not intended to cause her any harm. Studies: Jones admitted to his ex-partner that he had killed Miss Lee, who read international relations and sociology at Aston University (pictured) in Birmingham, Wolverhampton Crown Court was told . 'He further claimed that he had . completely lost track of time and therefore he didn't know how long it . was he was applying pressure to her throat. 'He said the background had been a petty quarrel over household chores and hair being found in the plughole. The two of them had started pushing each other' Gordon Aspden, prosecuting . 'Throughout the incident she had been looking at him as she had been struggling but he hadn't released his grip. 'According to what he said to the police, “the outcome wasn't what I expected, I didn't expect that to happen”. 'He said all he wanted to do was to . calm her down. He said after he had released her neck he carried her . through to his bedroom.' The court also heard that while in . Bristol, Jones had used Miss Lee's mobile phone to ring a company called . DialAFlight to try to arrange a flight to New York - but he hung up . before it was booked. Jones denies murder. The trial continues.

"A new poll suggests that the majority of the people who voted Ukip at the European elections will also vote for the party at the General Election less than a year away. In the ComRes survey 86 per cent of the people who put their cross in Ukip’s box will do so again in May 2015. For the first time in its history the Conservative Party did not come first or second in a national election beaten into third place by Nigel Farage’s ‘people’s army’ and Ed Miliband’s Labour. Scroll down for video . Next stop Newark: Ukip leader Nigel Farage celebrates his party's stunning win in the European elections . They're not going away, you know: A ComRes survey would appear to show that Ukip can expect to retain 86 per cent of its support at the General Election . More than 4.3million people voted for Ukip to give it its first national win. Tory ministers explained that away by saying that voters had merely ‘loaned’ their vote to Mr Farage’s party and would return to the fold in time for the General Election. ComRes’s poll taken a few days after the European elections appears to show that these suppositions are misguided. The survey found that 37 per cent of Ukip voters said that they were ‘certain’ to support the party at the General Election. Another 49 per cent said that they were ‘likely’ to do so, while a mere 14 per cent said that they would probably cast their vote elsewhere. The ComRes poll was commissioned by Paul Sykes, Ukip’s biggest financial backer. Mr Sykes has also pledged to help Ukip cause another major upset in this week’s Newark by-election. Mr Ukip: Paul Sykes is the party's biggest donor and commissioned a poll that shows that 86 per cent of Ukip's Euro voters will stick by the party next May . The Conservatives are so worried by another potential Ukip win that on Thursday of this week they sent five ministers including George Osborne, the Chancellor, Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and Sajid Javid, the Culture Secretary, to glad-hand the electorate in the constituency. David Cameron and Boris Johnson have also visited Newark to try to bolster support for their party. Walkabout: Prime Minister David Cameron (left), Boris Johnson (not pictured) and  Conservative by-election candidate Robert Jenrick (centre) visited Newark to persuade the locals to vote Tory on Thursday . The by-election was caused by the resignation of Tory Patrick Mercer (maj. 16,152) over a cash for questions scandal and at the moment the Conservatives lead Ukip by 36 to 28 per cent but Tory support is down 18 percentage points since the General Election while Ukip has gained 24 percentage points. Mr Sykes said that the ComRes poll findings should make the Conservatives realise that Ukip will threaten them at the General Election. ‘Conservative MPs, with a few honourable exceptions, appear to be in denial about the scale of the popular uprising against our current rulers. This is despite their party finishing third in the elections,’ he said. ‘They appear to think that the Ukip threat will go away (it won’t) or that the economic recovery will float them off the political rocks. 'They should recall what happened in 1997. Then the economy had been growing strongly for four years. That did not stop John Major going down to the worst Tory defeat since 1832.’ According to ComRes, 46 per cent of Ukip’s European voters supported the Tories at the 2010 General Election while 15 per cent had been Labour voters, and 16 per cent Liberal Democrats.","ComRes survey: 86% of Ukip’s voters will do so again in May 2015 .

"These shocking pictures show the terrible injuries inflicted on a nurse when two muggers punched, stamped on and kicked her as she waited for a bus outside a hospital. Lorna Hobson, 65, believed she was going to die as she was beaten on her way home from work. As she lay screaming in agony opposite Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital the two young men  ran off – only to return to continue the attack before finally making off with her bag. Nurse Lorna Hobson, pictured left before the attack, was left with horrific injuries, pictured right, after she was attacked by two male muggers as she made her way home from work at Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital . Mrs Hobson has been left so shocked that she says she will probably never work in nursing again. ‘It was obvious I was a nurse,’  said Mrs Hobson, who was left with injuries all over her body including deep bruises on her face and across her ribs. Now: Mrs Hobson is still recovering from the attack nearly two weeks later . ‘I feel angry they didn’t see my . uniform. I was wearing a big coat with NHS written on it but that didn’t . make any difference to these two men. They didn’t have any respect for . me or my uniform. ‘I . just find it so hard to comprehend and why did they have to beat me so . badly? I am still in a lot of pain and I am still traumatised. I still . can’t believe it happened to me.’ The health care assistant for the hospital’s evening and night service was attacked on December 28 at around 10pm after she had finished a four-hour shift. Mrs Hobson, a married mother of three with five grandchildren  who has been in nursing for 22 years, said: ‘We’d had a lovely evening, we had cut up the Christmas cake and had a nice time. I was really happy when I left.’ She then walked from the hospital to the bus stop outside to wait for the number 87 to take her home. ‘I walked down the path to the bus stop and I stood inside the bus shelter, which is brightly lit,’ she said. ‘I noticed two youths across the road. They passed me and they must have come up behind me.‘One of them said something about the time. I remember looking at my watch and then they jumped on me and grabbed my bag. I screamed and they punched me full in the face. Scene of the crime: Mrs Hobson was attacked by the two men as she waited at this bus stop to get home after finishing her shift at a nearby hospital . Mrs Hobson had just completed a four hour evening shift working as a health care assistant at Sheffield's Northern General Hospital . ‘They dragged me out of the shelter and up a gravel path nearby. I was screaming. It was dark and I couldn’t see anything. I just remember screaming and the kicks, the punches and the stamping.’ Still scared: Mrs Hobson said it is unlikely she will return to work after the incident . Mrs Hobson said the robbers left, possibly because they had been disturbed, but then came back to continue the assault. ‘I remember lying on the ground and thinking, “They’ve gone, I’m  safe and I’m alive” – but then I saw them coming back and they started it all over again. ‘I thought it was going to be the end and they were going to kill me.’ The thugs finally stopped the  beating when they were spotted by  a woman passer-by and fled with Mrs Hobson’s shoulder bag, which had her purse containing £60  and her house keys in it, along with medical paperwork. The passer-by helped Mrs Hobson to her feet and took her to her own casualty department. ‘After all that, it’s all a bit of a blur,’ she said. ‘I remember thinking, “I hope my patients’ notes are safe.” ‘I don’t feel I hate the people who hurt me, but for 22 years I have been a nurse and I have avoided anything happening to me. 'I doubt very much that I will be going back to work.’ The youths were described as 16 to 20, 6ft tall, skinny and dark-skinned. One was wearing grey jogging bottoms and a dark top.","Lorna Hobson, 65, was attacked near Sheffield's Northern General Hospital .

"More than 1,000 women suffered a sexual assault every day last year - but only one in 88 rape claims resulted in a conviction, a report said yesterday. One in five women has been a victim of sexual assault since the age of 16, with almost half a million adult females in England and Wales preyed upon every year, the study revealed. While most of the 400,000 female victims were subject to unwanted touching and indecent exposure, one in every 200 women was a victim of rape or another serious sexual assault. Shocking: One in five women have been a victim of sexual assault since the age of 16, alarming figures show (file photo) There are a total of 473,000 victims . of sex offences every year, for which 60,000 to 95,000 are victims of . rape, according to the Crime Survey for England and Wales. It was estimated that there were . 97,000 victims of the most serious sexual offences last year. The . analysis added that 90 per cent of such victims knew the person who . committed the offence. Despite the worryingly high figures, . the first joint statistical overview of sexual offending in England and . Wales by the Ministry of Justice, Home Office and Office of National . Statistics highlights only a very small number of sex offences lead to a . conviction.

A total of 1,070 criminals were . convicted for rape, according to the first joint overview of sexual . offending in England and Wales as reported by the Guardian. The report comes after Baroness Stern . voiced her concerns over government ministers misleading the public . about low rape conviction figures, which she said left victims feeling . neglected and stopped women coming forward. While most of the 400,000 female victims were subject to unwanted touching and indecent exposure, 69,000 women were victims of rape (file photo) Lady Stern, a prison reform campaigner . and human rights activist, called in her 2010 report for 'an end to the . widespread use of misleading rape conviction data  -  in particular the . six per cent conviction rate figure'. The new figures show 62.5 per cent of . rape cases ended in a conviction in 2011, eight per cent higher than in . 2005 where 800 were convicted. More rapists are also being jailed for increasingly long sentences. Yet rape crime remains under-reported . to the police compared with other crimes, with only 15 per cent of women . saying they had reported the offence to the police.

"Slain beauty: Susan Lowe was found raped and murdered in her home at age 19, and 30 years later, police say they finally caught her killer . Police in Washington state finally solved a 32-year cold case involving a woman who was raped and murdered thanks to DNA testing that led them to the suspected killer. Michael Allan Halgren, 56, a convicted sex offender with a history of violent crimes, was arrested this week and charged in the 1980 slaying of Susan Lowe. Lowe, who was a 19-year-old beauty at the time of her death, was strangled with a pair of pantyhose inside her Bellevue apartment. 'It's always rewarding to solve any case, but especially a cold case,' said detective Lieutenant Jim Hershey. On April 23, 1980, at around 10pm, Susan Lowe was alone in her apartment near Bellevue College watching the Seattle Supersonics game on television when she was brutally attacked by an intruder. The next morning, her roommate found the 19-year-old's naked body lying in her bed with pantyhose tightly wrapped around her neck, according to a police report. Investigators said Lowe was covered up by her killer in an effort to make it look like she was sleep, reported Kirkland Patch. A neighbor told police at the time that they heard someone loudly knocking on Lowe's door and then a noise 'like something hitting the wall,' followed later by the sound of a muffled scream. However, no one came to check up on Lowe or called for help. Police made no arrests in the rape and murder, and even a $1,000 did nothing to help investigators crack the case. Crime scene: Lowe was discovered nude with pantyhose around her neck inside her home in Bellevue, Washington, just three blocks from the house of her accused killer, Michael Halgren . Long after the trail went cold, the Bellevue Police Department continued searching for Lowe's killer, but it was not until this past May when the investigation hit a crucial breakthrough. Scientists from the Washington State Patrol Crime Lab linked Halgren's DNA to the biological evidence found inside Lowe's apartment in 1980. The 56-year-old was civilly committed to the McNeil Island Special Commitment Center (SCC) for violent sexual offenders after he was convicted of kidnapping a prostitute in 1995 and raping another Bellevue woman in 1989, the Seattle Times reported. Although Halgren had lived only three blocks away from Lowe's apartment in 1980, when he was 23 years old, his name was never associated with the murder until last year, when SCC officials collected DNA from all the patients. Halgren has a long history of sexual crimes. According to records, doctors at SCC learned that he had been a Peeping Tom in his teens, exposed himself to nearly 40 women in his 20s and raped more than 20 women, most of them prostitutes, after being discharged from the military in 1975. Halgren also revealed that he sexually assaulted a relative after his high school graduation and raped three more women between 1974 and 1980. Violent history: The 56-year-old man was civilly committed to the McNeil Island Special Commitment Center after he was convicted of kidnapping a prostitute in 1995 and raping another woman in 1989 . When interviewed in August by police, Halgren denied ever visiting the apartment complex where Lowe lived and claimed he only had sex with his fiancée at the time of her murder, but added that he would have been interested in meeting Lowe becasue she was very pretty, according to charging documents. When presented with the DNA evidence linking him to the crime, Halgren revised his story, telling a detective that he ad a one-night stand with the 19-year-old, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. On Wednesday, Halgren was charged with first-degree murder and transferred to King County Jail to wait for his arraignment on January 23. If convicted, he could face a life in prison without parole.","Susan Lowe's nude body was found in her bed inside apartment in Bellevue, Washington, April 23, 1980 .

"David and Samantha Cameron refer to their Downing Street home as ‘the cage’, and try and escape ‘on a regular basis’, the Prime Minister has revealed. Mr Cameron scotched rumours that his wife has urged him to quit Number 10 after the next election, saying she was ‘fully supportive of my work’. But, in a revealing interview with The House magazine, he confirmed that the couple try and escape for regular ‘date nights’ to get away from the stresses of work. David Cameron has said he and his wife Samantha regularly enjoy nights out to escape the 'cage' of Downing Street, where they have lived since he became Prime Minister in May 2010 . Mr Cameron said the couple, pictured here on holiday in Majorca, escape for regular 'date nights' to get away from the stresses of work . ‘Last night, we went out for supper - dinner - quite early actually,’ he said. ‘I was tucked up nice and early. We try and get out of the cage on a regular basis.’ He said Mrs Cameron had ‘created a wonderful flat’ in Number 10 after masterminding a major refurbishment, which included the installation of a new £25,000 designer kitchen. But he said their Oxfordshire constituency home, where they spent Christmas, ‘does feel like home’. The description of Number 10 as ‘the cage’ sums up the frustration of living above the shop, constantly surrounded by officials. Cherie Blair referred to her Downing Street home as the ‘goldfish bowl’. Mr Cameron confirmed that it is still his ‘intention’ to send his eldest daughter Nancy to a state secondary school. He has previously said he is ‘terrified’ by the prospect of finding a good school, but said there was now ‘real improvement’ taking place in the capital’s schools. The Prime Minister also revealed that the Conservatives will campaign on the slogan ‘Don’t turn back’ at the next election. He told House magazine: ‘We’re very “sleeves rolled up”, we were the people that have got Britain on the right track. Don’t turn back, trust us to keep delivering, to keep providing - that’s what the message will be.' The Camerons, pictured here on holiday in north Cornwall, have recently carried out a major refurbishment at their Downing Street home, which included the installation of a new £25,000 designer kitchen . Mr Cameron acknowledged that the party needed to ‘do better’ with black and ethnic minority voters and improve its performance in the major cities if it was to win the election. He said he remained committed to delivering a ‘more diverse party’, and said he was keen to promote more women to senior positions. He dropped heavy hints that there would be another Cabinet reshuffle before the election, with women MPs likely to be the biggest gainers. The Prime Minister defended controversial cuts to child benefit for the better off. He acknowledged that people on £50-£60,000 were not ‘rich’ but said they were ‘clearly better off than people on £20-£30,000.’ Mr Cameron said his wife was 'fully supportive' of his work, scotching rumours she had urged him to quit Number 10 after the next election . ‘I don’t relish taking money from anyone and, you know, child benefit is a popular and successful benefit,’ he said. ‘It goes to the mum, you know, it’s a good slug of money, £20 for the first child, so I don’t relish taking it away from anyone and people I’m sure put it to good use, but, you know, to govern is to choose. We have to make difficult choices about the deficit and I think this was the right choice.’ He confirmed that he would bring in a much-hyped tax break for married couples before the election. Mr Cameron also revealed that he is not a fan of the Danish political drama Borgen, which is cult viewing at Westminster, saying it is ‘too much like work’. But he and his wife are addicted to the Danish crime series The Killing, watching ‘back-to-back’ episodes of the third series over Christmas.","PM and his wife consider their house in Oxfordshire as 'home'

"Parliamentary computers are being used to view hardcore pornography featuring sadomasochism and foot and fat fetishism. The X-rated websites have been accessed more than 2,500 times on computers used by MPs, peers and their staff. Gay cruising websites have also been visited a further 3,500 times along with obscure erotica sites – including one showing naked women posing with cats. Exposed: X-rated websites have been accessed more than 2,500 times on computers used by MPs, peers and their staff . Asked for an explanation, a  parliamentary spokesman claimed the sites may have been visited accidentally. The Mail on Sunday obtained the information through a Freedom of Information enquiry. It covers a 14-month period between May 2011 and July 2012. The visits are a breach of parliamentary IT rules, which bar online ‘pornography’, ‘nudity’  and ‘adult/mature content’. It follows the revelation in this newspaper earlier this month that parliamentary computers were used to click thousands of times on a website that encourages adulterous affairs. Harry Potter, a barrister specialising in obscenity cases, said: ‘Having viewed the material, it does not in my opinion fall foul of the law as constituting extreme pornography. It is, however, undoubtedly hardcore pornography.’ A variety of foot fetish websites – which include pornographic images of lurid sex acts involving feet – have been viewed 470 times. Another website featuring an array of pictures of naked women lying next to cats has been viewed 17 times. A Polish pornography website was accessed 292 times in May 2011. In the same month a dating website was clicked on 653 times. The website boasts it is ‘dedicated to connecting fun-loving singles across the UK’. The Parliament IT firewall is supposed to block ‘personals/dating’ websites. However, in addition to the 2,549 clicks on porn sites, gay cruising websites have been visited 3,459 times. Shamed: The Mail On Sunday's exclusive report revealed that Out Of Town Affairs, a website that brings together married men and women seeking sex, was clicked on 52,375 times in seven months on Parliament computers . A gay dating website was accessed 2,828 times in May 2011. The website states it provides a ‘platform for the gay and bisexual male and transgender community’. Another website that allows users to pick which MPs have  ‘the most sex-appeal’ has been clicked on 12,371 times. A sex-toy shopping website was also visited. Earlier this month, The Mail on Sunday revealed that Out Of Town Affairs, a website that brings together married men and women seeking sex, was clicked on 52,375 times in seven months on Parliament computers. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Many people working in Parliament are spending far too much time surfing websites that have nothing to do with their jobs. What’s more, this evidence suggests codes of conduct are being breached. ‘It is vital that taxpayers are able to scrutinise how time they are paying for is spent and that anyone caught breaking the rules is appropriately punished.’ A Parliament spokeswoman said it was possible the sites were visited accidentally. She said: ‘A user may access a site that contains optional or automatic links to another which are recorded without active connection. ‘But where there is trustworthy evidence that an employee has breached the acceptable use policy, it is treated as an issue subject to disciplinary procedures. ‘However, direct employees of Parliament are not the only users of the parliamentary network.’ Discipline: A Parliament spokeswoman said it was possible the sites were visited accidentally, but were an employee to breach the acceptable use policy they would be subject to disciplinary procedures .","Parliamentary computers used to look at foot and fat fetishism .

"Twenty years after the horrific ordeal in which she was chained in a coffin-sized box for 17 days, Katie Beers says she can never 'fully have closure' on the events that she suffered as a 10-year-old girl. Now 30, Beers has co-written a book about her ordeal and reveals that despite the terrible abuse she suffered in her early years - both before and during her kidnapping - she is now a happily married mother to two kids Logan, 3, and Halee who was born in 2011. In 'Buried Memories: Katie Beers' Story,' she recalls the abuse that she suffered at the hand of her captor John Esposito. Telling her story: On the 20th anniversary of her ordeal, Katie Beers has co-written a book with a television reporter who covered her kidnapping . Dungeon: A crane raises a 6 foot by 9 foot bunker out of the earth at the property of John Esposito in this January 18, 1993 file photo . Beers was kidnapped three days before . her tenth birthday on Dec 27, 1992 by family friend Esposito. He took . her to his house and imprisoned her in a padlocked cabinet the size of a . coffin. During her period in captivity, Beers recalls that Esposito repeatedly molested her and provided only a diet of soft drinks and candy, including After Eight mints. 'Big John came down to my cage regularly. It seemed like once a day,' she told People magazine. 'He would bring me a toy or juice, and then he would rape me.' Beer's kidnapping attracted nationwide . attention in early 1993, when revelations surfaced while she was still . missing that she had suffered years of neglect from her mother and had . been repeatedly sexually assaulted by her godmother's husband since she . was a toddler. Now: Katie is a 30-year-old married mother-of-two and has finally decided to speak about her ordeal in her book Buried Memoirs . Then: Katie vanished just days before her tenth birthday and was kept chained in an underground dungeon by John Esposito . Ordeal: In the book, Katie also writes that she was molested and raped by her godmother's husband from the time she was a toddler . After kidnapper Esposito admitted to detectives on January 13, 1993, that he . had kidnapped Beers and showed them the dungeon where she was hidden . for 17 days under his Bay Shore, New York, home, the little girl was . placed in foster care and raised in a comfortable East Hampton home with . four siblings. Her foster . parents not only imposed newfound discipline into her life, making her . go to school regularly and do small chores around the house, but they . also shielded Beers from intense media interest. Beers is now a 30-year-old married . mother of two who earned a degree in business management and works in . insurance sales near her home in rural Pennsylvania. Little has been seen or heard of . Beers since then until this week, when she has reintroduced herself to . the world at large as part of a media blitz to promote the book. Twenty years later, she describes her abduction as 'the best thing that happened to me.' 'I would have never gotten out of the abuse situation I was in,' she reasons. She went on to play volleyball at East Hampton High, participated in drama productions and went to college in Pennsylvania, where she earned a degree and in 2004 met Derek, the man who would become her husband and the father of their two children. 'There's no point really in me right now being sad or wondering what if,' she told the AP. 'I try not to be sad about what happened, because ultimately it made me who I am today, and I'm very satisfied and happy with my life,' she said. Beers agreed about four years ago to co-write the book with WCBS-TV reporter Carolyn Gusoff, although she had thought about writing a book for many years. Dungeon: After 17 days John Esposito finally confessed to police that he abducted Katie and led them to the underground bunker, which was hidden by a 200lb concrete wall built underneath his Long Island home . 'I want to be able to help people who might not know where to turn,' she explained. 'To see that there is a road to recovery.' She has declined to disclose her exact hometown, married surname or college alma mater, citing privacy concerns for her family. In . the book, Beers writes that she had been molested and raped by Sal . Inghilleri - her godmother's husband - from the time she was a toddler. Inghilleri, who served 12 years in prison for molesting Beers, died in jail in 2009 following his arrest on a parole violation. Beers . also writes that Esposito raped her in the dungeon, explaining that she . repressed her memory of the sexual assault for many years as a defense . mechanism. Breaking her silence: Katie, pictured during an interview on Monday, was found in 1993 after 17 days held captive in a neighbor's dungeon-like bunker . Esposito, who pleaded guilty to kidnapping, was never charged with rape. He is serving 15 years to life and has been denied parole several times; his next parole hearing is later this year. At . a 2007 parole hearing, Esposito described himself as asexual and said . while he kissed the child, he never engaged in sexual relations. He told Gusoff in a letter published in the book that he believes he deserves to be released. 'I . think Katie knows I will always wish her well,' Esposito writes. 'I'm . sorry for what I've done. I'm sorry I even thought it up. It was a . mistake.' During her time in the dungeon, Beers writes, she rarely slept, fearing abuse from Esposito. She said she was afraid Esposito . might molest her while she slept, but also was concerned that he would . photograph her sleeping and send the image to police. Katie has never spoken publicly about her ordeal . at the hands of John Esposito, left, in an attempt to live a 'normal' life . but has now opened up in her book, Buried Memories, . right . She feared if police thought she was dead, they might stop looking for her. She . 'celebrated' her 10th birthday while a prisoner of Esposito's and was . heard on an audiotape found in the dungeon after her release singing . 'Happy Birthday' to herself, although she says today she has no . recollection of that. Esposito, . she writes, fed her primarily junk food and soda; to this day she is . repulsed by After Eight mints because they were a staple in captivity. She . did have access to a small television, but says she can no longer . listen to Whitney Houston's version of 'I Will Always Love You' because . it played incessantly on MTV and VH1 while she in the dungeon. She didn't realize it until many . years later, but says now that she frequently watched Gusoff - then a . reporter for Long Island's News12 cable station - filing reports on the . police search for her while she was missing. 'It was like I had known her for 16 years' when they met in 2008 to begin work on the book, she said. Neglect: Marilyn Beers, Katie's mother, often left her young daughter with her godmother and husband, who sexually abused and raped her for years . Gusoff notes that as abhorrent as . Beers' sexual abuse and neglect was at the hands of her elders before . the kidnapping, it may have steeled her into a survival mode. Dominick . Varrone, the Suffolk County detective who led the investigation, . agreed, telling Gusoff in the book that 'because of her upbringing, the . sexual experiences, the abuse, and street smarts and toughness, she was . much more advanced than the normal nine-year-old, and we believe that . contributed to her survival.' Marilyn . Beers, who is described in the book as a hard-working but largely . absentee mother who ceded responsibility for raising Katie and her older . brother to Inghilleri's wife and others, did not return a telephone . message seeking comment about the book. 'I . hope that more does come out of the book,' Katie Beers said. 'I would . love to be able to help other kids or adults or to be an inspirational . or motivational speaker, something like that. But if I go back to my life in rural Pennsylvania and go back to my insurance sales job I would love that, too. 'I'm very happy with where I'm at.'

"Compared with the splendour of the pyramids or the majesty of the Taj Mahal, it may appear a fairly modest creation. But a field of stone monuments in Wiltshire has been named as the second best heritage site in the world. The collection of Neolithic stones in Avebury has been placed ahead of much more recognisable sites including the Valley of the Kings in Egypt and the Forbidden City in China. Heritage: A visitor gets up close and touches one of the stones that form the largest stone circle in Europe at Avebury, Wiltshire. The site has been rated as the world's second best heritage site by travel experts . Special: Aerial view of Avebury village and neolithic henge stone circle . Ancient: The stones at Avebury are thought to date back to 2600BC . Experts at Which? Travel magazine placed Mexico’s ancient city of Monte Alban in first place. The panel used criteria including the preservation of the site and appeal of the local region as a place to take a holiday. The three stone circles at Avebury . outscored more famous historic landmarks because of a high score on the . overall visitor experience. Chart-topper: Monte Alban, Oaxaca, in Mexico is the world's best heritage site according to travel experts from Which? magazine . Number seven: Avebury's neolithic monument was rated higher than the iconicTaj Mahal, in Agra city, India . Number ten: The ancient Pyramids, Giza, Cairo, Egypt . The site, which attracts more than . 250,000 visitors a year, was praised because tourists can wander freely . between the stones, unlike the more famous Stonehenge, also in . Wiltshire, where the formations are roped-off. Avebury, near Calne, beat the pyramids . of Egypt partly because rural Wiltshire was considered a nicer place to . visit than the Sahara desert. Visitors to the greener parts of the . county enjoy beautiful rolling hills and quiet, picturesque villages. Which? Travel magazine described the Unesco World Heritage site as ‘the . best-preserved and most impressive complex of prehistoric sites in . Europe’. Reacting to the news, Stuart Wheeler . of Wiltshire Council said: ‘We have always known we have a wonderful . piece of history on our doorstep and now we have official confirmation.’ Avebury is a Neolithic henge  monument . comprising of three stone circles.

"China's children are growing up more pessimistic and less trusting than before one-child policy was introduced according to research. In China the law generally limits urban families to having just one child in an attempt to prevent further overcrowding in a nation with a population of over 1.3 billion. But researchers say the policy, which was introduced in 1979, has had a negative impact and new evidence suggests as a result children are less trusting, less competitive, more pessimistic, less conscientious and more risk-averse than people born before the policy was implemented. Ramifications: Parents play with their children at a kid's play area in a shopping mall in Beijing. China's little emperors are growing up more pessimistic and less trusting than before one-child policy was introduced, according to research . The study's authors say the one-child policy has significant ramifications for Chinese society, leading to less risk-taking in the labor market and possibly fewer entrepreneurs. 'Trust is really important, not just social interactions but in terms of negotiations in business, working with colleagues in business, negotiating between firms,' said one of the authors, Lisa Cameron. 'If we have lower levels of trust, that could make these kinds of negotiations and interactions more difficult.' Choice: Chinese women walk their babies in a park in Beijing. The one-child policy has led to a major gender imbalance as many families favour having boys rather than girls (file picture) Known to many as the one-child policy, China's actual birth-restriction rules are more complicated. The government limits most urban couples to one child, and allows two children for rural families if their first-born is a girl. There are numerous other exceptions as well, including looser rules for minority families and a two-child limit for parents who are themselves both singletons. The new work by Cameron of Monash University in Australia and co-authors is published online Friday in the journal Science. The researchers said the results don't necessarily apply to children born outside of the situation they studied: modern-day, urban China. They recruited 421 Beijing men and women who were born within an eight-year period that included dates just before and just after the policy took effect in 1979. About 27 percent of the participants born in 1975 were the only child in their families, rising to 82 percent of those born in 1980 and 91 percent of those born in 1983. Researchers said the sample was better educated than the general population of Beijing but otherwise similar. Crowding: In China the law which generally limits urban families to having just one child in an attempt to prevent further overcrowding in nation with a population of over 1.3 billion . They administered tests to measure their altruism, trust, trustworthiness, risk attitudes and competitiveness, and gave them personality surveys. Cameron said the participants' ages and views on ideological changes in China didn't appear to affect the results. The findings - including indications that those in the study were more sensitive and nervous - are no surprise, said Zou Hong of the School of Psychology at Beijing Normal University, who was not involved in the research. 'Only children in Chinese families are loved and given almost everything by their families and they can get resources at home without competition,' she said. 'Once they enter society, they are no different from other people. Having been overly protected, they feel a sense of loss and show less competitiveness.' Zou said parents of an only child tend to become overly nervous, when they are ill, for example, and 'that feeling will be passed on to the children and make them become more sensitive and nervous.' The Chinese government credits the one-child policy with preventing hundreds of millions of births and helping lift countless families out of poverty. But the strict limits have led to forced abortions and sterilizations, even though such measures are illegal. Couples who flout the rules face hefty fines, seizure of their property and loss of their jobs. Last year, a government think tank urged China's leaders to start phasing out the policy and allow two children for every family by 2015, saying the country had paid a 'huge political and social cost.' It said the policy had resulted in social conflict, high administrative costs and led indirectly to a long-term gender imbalance because of illegal abortions of female fetuses and the infanticide of baby girls by parents who cling to a traditional preference for a son. The researchers in Australia noted that children born long after 1979 will have grown up with very limited extended family and in a society dominated by those born into one-child families. So the psychological effects of the one-child policy 'would, if anything, be magnified,' they wrote. Toni Falbo, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas in Austin who studies these children, was puzzled that the study's findings showed poor performance so consistently in virtually all measures. She said she would have expected a more mixed picture, and she hopes follow-up research is done. In any case, there's no reason to think that the results would be similar for children in the United States, she said. In China the only child grows up with different expectations, Falbo said, with Chinese authorities emphasizing that 'these kids have to be the best possible. Most Americans want their kid to be happy; they're not aiming for a world-class child of some sort.' Careful studies done elsewhere that look for certain qualities in the only child find that 'on average, they're pretty much like everybody else,' she said.","Research: Children are less trusting, less competitive, .

"The lawyer for one of James Bulger's murderers today revealed the 'living nightmare' of representing the notorious child killer. Speaking ahead of the 20th anniversary of the toddler's death, Laurence Lee recalled how he was convinced that 'angelic-looking' Jon Venables must be innocent of the brutal crime. He also claimed that were it not for the malign influence of Robert Thompson, whom he compared to 'the Pied Piper', Venables would never have taken part in the killing. The 10-year-old was on his way to school to pick up some gerbils which his teacher had asked him to look after, but was apparently led astray by Thompson telling him: 'Forget the gerbils, let's go robbing.' Scroll down for video . Horror: Laurence Lee, who was Jon Venables' lawyer, has opened up about his experiences . Killers: Venables, left, and Robert Thompson, right, were convicted of the murder of toddler James Bulger . Mr Lee represented Venables, now one of the most notorious criminals in Britain, from the moment the boy was arrested on February 18, 1993. He and Thompson had been caught on CCTV six days earlier holding two-year-old James by the hand and leading him through the Strand shopping centre in Bootle, near Liverpool. Over the following hours, they beat and tortured him before leaving him for dead on a nearby railway line. But Mr Lee said today that in his first meeting with his client, he found it impossible to believe that he could be guilty. 'He was like an angelic-looking eight-year-old,' said the solicitor, who now runs his own law firm in Liverpool. 'I thought, ""What am I doing here? He couldn’t be capable of anything like this."" He was so convincing in his first interview that he had been nowhere near the Strand.' CCTV: The two-year-old being led away from the Strand shopping centre in Bootle by the older boys . Venables claimed that he had been near Goodison Park with Thompson, and said neither of them had been at the shopping centre where the toddler went missing. Mr Lee, 59, said: 'I believed him. He was convincing. And it was only after there was a time-out and the officers who interviewed Thompson had a briefing and came back for the second interview. 'And again I was in blissful ignorance thinking, it’s the easiest money - I felt guilty, actually, because this boy had had nothing to do with anything, I thought - until having got him cosy with his little space pens and his can of Coke, they kept him nice and relaxed and they said: ""Look we’ve spoken to Robert and he says you were in the Strand.""' Heartbreak: The 20th anniversary of the murder of James, pictured, is coming up on Tuesday . After a silence Venables responded: 'Well OK, we were in the Strand but we never grabbed a kid.' Mr Lee said: 'He got up and he grabbed his mum and he was crying and I thought, ""Oh my God, what have I let myself in for here?"" 'The walls came crashing in at that moment and I knew what he was like, and it was like a living nightmare.' He said that from that point he was 'caught up in a maelstrom of massive criminology' which he could never have prepared for, and described how police had to check his car to ensure he was not targeted by vigilantes in a reprisal attack. 'I had never been in this position before,' he said. 'I thought I was going to get assassinated or something at first because the public’s feelings - including my own - were running high.' Mr Lee sympathised with Venables' parents, whom he described as 'very respectable people', saying that the boy's upbringing was 'no worse than any kid in Liverpool'. He put the blame for the murder squarely on the shoulders of the other 10-year-old: 'Thompson had this kind of hold. He was like the Pied Piper.' According to Mr Lee, Venables had been asked by his teacher to look after the class pets: 'He was on his way to pick up the gerbils from the school, and it was only because he bumped into Thompson who said, ""Forget the gerbils, let's go robbing"".' The lawyer criticised officials for choosing to hold the children's trial in the main courtroom at Preston Crown Court, saying: 'They couldn’t have found a more daunting venue than Court One at Preston. It is scary.' Appeal: The child's parents Ralph and Denise during a press conference after their son's disappearance . However, Mr Lee also expressed sympathy for the Bulgers, and said he would have been willing to prosecute Venables and Thompson. 'My number one sentiment is for Denise [James’s mother] - still is and always will be,' he said. 'The wounds re-open for that lady every time this comes up and now must be horrendous for her.' The solicitor has not seen Venables since 1994, and said he was shocked to hear that his client had been jailed again in 2010 for downloading child pornography, while Thompson had managed to stay 'under the radar'. 'Venables couldn’t handle being out,' he said. 'He was always looking over his shoulder. They may be at liberty but they will never be free.' Peter Kilfoyle, who was MP for the area where James was killed, has used the 20th anniversary of the case to call for new measures to deal with children who commit serious crimes. Memorial: Ralph holding James's coffin at the child's funeral in Merseyside in March 1993 . 'I think people would have been more prepared for an older person being held responsible for James’s murder,' he said. 'The fact that the perpetrators were also young children, for so many people that blew their minds. They couldn’t understand how this could happen.' The 66-year-old Labour politician added: 'What we didn’t have, and I’m not sure if we have them today, are the appropriate facilities to deal with these exceptional circumstances. 'Admittedly a small cohort of youngsters, who commit terrible crimes or have got horrendous problems. I don’t think that we have worked out properly how we deal with these children.' James's father Ralph Bulger is releasing a new book called My James, in which he reveals how in his darkest moments he blamed then wife Denise for letting their son get out of her sight. He also speaks about how he downed two bottles of whisky a day to blot out the pain, and how he considered suicide in the wake of the tragedy. February 12, 1993: Two-year-old James Bulger is snatched during a shopping trip to the Strand shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside. February 13: Parents Denise and Ralph Bulger make an emotional appeal for the safe return of their son, while detectives release stills from the shopping centre’s CCTV cameras. The images, showing James being led away by the hand, become symbolic of the crime. February 14: The toddler’s battered body is found by children playing on a freight railway line more than two miles from the Strand. February 18: Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, aged 10, are arrested in connection with the murder of James and later charged. They are the youngest people to be charged with murder in the 20th century. February 22: There are violent scenes outside South Sefton Magistrates’ Court in Bootle when the two primary school pupils, then anonymous, make their first appearance. March 1: James is buried. November 24: Thompson and Venables are convicted of James’s murder following a 17-day trial at Preston Crown Court.

"Twenty-four states and New York City were at the worst levels for the week ending Jan. 5, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That's five fewer states than the previous week, lending a bit of hope that the epidemic has begun to wane since those states with decreased activity, such as Florida and South Carolina, were also where the flu first started growing at a terrifying pace. ""It may be decreasing in some areas, but that's hard to predict,"" CDC . Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said. ""Trends only in the next week or two will show whether we have in fact . crossed the peak."" Getting better: High levels of flu activity has dropped in the past week, giving hope that the virus has slowed down . But the positive news was tempered by the startling figure that 47 states now report widespread flu activity. The only states not on that list are Hawaii, California and Mississippi. The death toll continues to rise with 21 children nationally having passed away from the flu, which has hit harder and earlier than previous years, USA Today said. Officials in New York City are warning that the 'severe’ strain has reached epidemic proportions across the city. Two of the 21 children to have died have been identified as Tahila Johnson, 6, from Dallas, Texas and Joshua Polehna, 15, from Fenton, Michigan . New York health officials advised the public to get flu shots in an attempt to limit the impact of the virus as five per cent of patients in city emergency rooms report influenza-like symptoms, compared to two per cent of patients last year. 'Our message is it’s still not too late to get your flu shot,' said New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley. 'If you haven’t gotten the flu yet and you haven’t gotten your flu shot . yet, you could still get it. 'It’s a bad year. We’ve got lots . of flu, it’s mainly type AH3N2, which tends to be a little more severe. 'So we’re seeing plenty of cases of flu and plenty of people sick with . flu,' he said. 'Anybody that doesn’t think so is . just missing an opportunity to protect themselves. There’s no guarantees . in life. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg got a . flu injection in October but still got ill last month. He said that . won’t stop him from continuing to get vaccinated every year, CBS 2 . reported. 'You can take a flu shot, walk across the street and get hit by . a car. It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take your flu shot,' Bloomberg . said. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious . Diseases said the outbreak could be the worst since 2003-2004. 'We are into what would classically be described as a flu epidemic,' the Institute's Director, Anthony Fauci, told Agence France Presse. Danger zones: The most recent Center for Disease Control map shows the states with the highest number of flu cases . Sick: Thousands of people are going to doctors complaining of illness with a severe cough being the most widespread symptom . The epidemic, which broke out in early December, has caused more than 3,700 . hospitalizations across the United States. An entire school district in Oklahoma on Thursday was forced to close until Monday since 25 percent of its students were ill, ABC News said. Eight people throughout Oklahoma have died from the flu since October. Among the 21 children who have died are Tahila Johnson, 6, from Dallas, Texas and Joshua Polehna, 15, from Fenton, Michigan. Tahila was found dead in her bed, the day after her family had taken . her to the emergency room with flu-like symptoms, . including fever and chills. Family members are questioning whether she . should have been sent home Monday from Dallas Regional Medical Center in . Mesquite. According to a police report, her family took her in for . treatment and was given a flu diagnosis and a prescription for Zyrtec. The next morning, the girl’s grandmother found her dead. The Michigan Department of Community Health has said that Polenha had no underlying health condition. The 2012-2013 flu vaccine protects against three different flu viruses: an H3N2 virus, an influenza B virus and the H1N1 virus. Google, which tracks national flu trends according to the number of times people ask about the flu, rates the current outbreak as 'intense.' Although patients are being advised to seek medical . attention if they are sick and have clear symptoms, . emergency rooms are so overloaded that hospitals are instructing people to see their . primary care physicians first. Not enough: Roughly three-fourths of people with the flu said they did not get vaccinations this year . 'It’s about five weeks ahead of the average flu season,' said Lyn Finelli, lead of the surveillance and response team that monitors influenza for the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. 'We haven’t seen such an early season since 2003 to 2004.' During that flu season, Joe Lastinger's daughter Emily, 3, died only five days after coming down with the flu in late January. 'That was the first really bad season for children in a while,' said Lastinger, 40. 'For whatever reason that's not well understood, it affected her and it killed her.' 1. Cough . 2. Sore throat . 3. Fatigue . 4. Headache . 5. Body Ache . 6. Fever . In that season, illnesses peaked in early to mid-December, with flu-related pneumonia and deaths peaking in early January. That season was considered a 'moderately severe' season for flu, and ended in mid-February. It's still too early to tell how bad this year's flu season will get. During the 2010-2011 flu season, the CDC reports vaccine's were effective four about 60 percent for all age groups combined. While . there were then reports of vaccinated people developing . laboratory-confirmed flu strains, CDC officials said it's not yet . possible to know if this year's trends match up though they are . 'watching the situation closely.' Those . officials also noted that this year's vaccines seem to be a good match . for the two strains of influenza A and one of influenza B circulating. The H3N2 strain is dominant this year, and it can cause more serious illnesses. Flu seasons vary widely in severity with some year's totaling up to 200,000 hospitalized and between 3,000 to 49,000 dead .","Twenty-four states and New York City are at high levels, down from 29 states one week earlier .

"A disabled man faces jail for laughing too loudly in his own home after his neighbour complained he could hear his loud guffaws across the driveway. Robert Schiavelli, 42, of Rockville Centre, New York has been accused of 'disturbing the peace' after police were called to his home on February 12 and 13 after receiving complaints. But Schiavelli, who is considered disabled because he suffers from neurological impairments and suffers seizures, said he was just laughing off the neighbour's offensive remarks about his disability. Accused: Robert Schiavelli, 42, has been served two summonses after a neighbour complained about his laugh . He and his mother, who also lives at . the home, claim that the neighbour, Daniel O'Hanian, has ridiculed . Schiavelli for years and 'sneered' at the man on the day of the first . complaint. To cope with the alleged treatment, he has learned to laugh it off, he said. 'What else are you supposed to do when . someone calls you a retard?' Schiavelli, who graduated from high . school as a special-education student, said to the New York Post. 'The last time I checked, it was not a crime to laugh - except in Rockville Centre.' Scene: Robert Schiavelli, who lives in the home on the left, claims he only laughed when his neighbour Daniel Ohanian, who lives on the right, sneered at him for his disability . 'Targeted': Robert lives at the home with his mother Susanne (pictured), who said she saw the neighbour sneer at her son before he started laughing on the day the complaints were made . But he was slapped with two summons, which each carry a $250 fine or 15 days in jail. They allege he acted 'in such a manner as to annoy, disturb, interfere with, obstruct, or be offensive to others'. 'It's absurd,' his lawyer Andrew Campanelli told the Post. 'My client faces 30 days in jail for laughing.' At his Schiavelli's arraignment on Tuesday, Campanelli called his client a 'gentle giant' and said that he had learned to respond to offensive remarks from his neighbours by laughing. Schiavelli and his mother Susanne, 65, have been embroiled in a years-long dispute with O'Hanian, the Post reported. His mother defended her son, telling CBS New York that he had 'an infectious, cute laugh, I love it. It makes me want to laugh'. O'Hanian’s wife, Virginia, told the Post that 'the police investigated and found there was cause' for the summonses, but her husband did not comment. A return court date has yet to be set.","Robert Schiavelli's neighbour complained and he now faces 30 days in jail .

"Oxford University was yesterday accused of ‘institutional bias’ against ethnic minorities amid striking differences in different racial groups’ entry rates. White applicants to some of the most competitive courses are up to twice as likely to get places even with the same A-level grades, according to data released under the Freedom of Information Act. Overall, of the white, British students applying in 2010 and 2011, 25.7 per cent received an offer to attend the university, compared to 17.2 per cent of students from ethnic minorities. Student places: Oxford University has been accused of 'institutional bias' against ethnic minorities because of differences between the application success rates of racial groups . The gaps were most marked in medicine and economics and management but there was statistically no difference in success rates between white and non-white students applying for law. In medicine, 43 per cent of white students who went on to receive three or more A* grades at A-level got offers, compared with 22.1 per cent of minority students with the same grades, according to data obtained by The Guardian newspaper. Discrimination: David Tammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, said student figures suggested an 'institutional bias' which Oxford denies . For economics and management, 19.1 per . cent of white applicants received offers, compared with 9.3 per cent for . ethnic minorities. Among the most able, these success rates soared to . 44.4 per cent and 29.5 per cent respectively. David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, . told The Guardian that the figures suggested ‘institutional bias’, an . allegation Oxford last night denied. An Oxford University spokeswoman said: ‘We refute any allegation of discrimination or institutional bias in strong terms and consider such allegations to be unsubstantiated and very serious. ‘Oxford University is committed to selecting the very best students, regardless of race, ethnicity or any other factor. This is not only the right thing to do but is in our own interests. ‘Differences in success rates between ethnic groups are therefore something we are continuing to examine carefully for possible explanations. ‘We do know that a tendency by students from certain ethnic groups to apply disproportionately for the most competitive subjects reduces the success rate of those ethnic groups overall. ‘However, we have never claimed this was the only factor in success rate disparities between students with similar exam grades. ‘We do not know students’ A-level grades when selecting, as they have not yet taken their exams. Aptitude tests, GCSEs and interviews, which are used in our selection process, have not been explored in this analysis and are important in reaching reliable conclusions.’ Cambridge University was unable to give a similar breakdown of data. Oxford University spokeswoman: 'We do not know students' A-level grades when selecting, as they have not yet taken their exams. Aptitude tests, GCSEs and interviews, which are used in our selection process, have not been explored in this analysis' But data it provided from 2007-9 - before the A* at A-level was introduced - suggested that 35 per cent of white students with top A-levels gained offers to study medicine compared to 24 per cent for ethnic minority students. A Cambridge University spokeswoman said: ‘Admissions decisions are based on students’ ability, commitment and potential to achieve. ‘Our commitment to improving access to the university is longstanding and unwavering. ‘We aim to ensure that anyone with the ability, passion and commitment to apply to Cambridge receives all the support necessary for them to best demonstrate their potential.’","White applicants to some of the most competitive courses are twice as likely to get places .

"A mother and father murdered their seven-week-old baby girl who died after suffering a catalogue of terrible injuries, a court has heard. Kristal Davison had skull fractures, broken ribs and a broken . leg which were caused over a number of weeks before her . death, Leeds Crown Court heard. Lee Davison, 28, and Jessica Hopkinson, 19, both deny harming the baby at their home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, who died from a head injury after at least two 'episodes of violence or trauma'. Accused: Mother of the baby Jessica Hopkinson, left, and father Lee Davison, right, both deny harming Kristal who was subjected to at least 'two episodes of violence or trauma' before she died . Davison, 28, called an ambulance on the morning of April 12 last year reporting that Kristal was gasping for breath. When . paramedics arrived, the baby was found to be pale, limp and lifeless . and was taken to hospital, where she died the following day. Julian Goose QC, prosecuting, said: 'Kristal was subjected to at least two, possibly more, episodes of violence or trauma in her short life.' Seven-week old Kristal was found 'limp, pale and lifeless' by paramedics after Davison dialled 999 in April last year . He added: 'Both defendants admit that Kristal was in their care at all material times. How she came to suffer so many injuries with such a catastrophic effect is only known by the two defendants.' A post-mortem examination found bruising and grazes to her head and face, internal bruising to her scalp, two distinct trauma injuries to her skull, bleeding to the brain and eyes, healing rib fractures and healing fractures to the left thigh and shin bone. Mr Goose said: 'Kristal was subjected to at least two and quite possibly more episodes of violence or trauma at different times to different parts of her body, including her head, ribcage and left leg. 'The injuries relating to the brain, the eyes and bleeding to the surface of the brain were indicative of violent shaking. 'The fractures to the skull establish that there was a significant blunt force applied to the head. 'The fractures to the ribs and to the left leg established that she had been subjected to violence to those parts of her body.' Both defendants were arrested and interviewed by police. Mr Goose said Davison and Hopkinson, from Ashleigh Avenue, Pontefract, West Yorkshire, both refused to tell the truth to police. He told the court that Hopkinson and Davison had started a relationship in early 2011 with Hopkinson falling pregnant in May that year, after which they were seen by social workers. Mr Goose said: 'The relationship between the defendants was at times volatile. Neighbours were able to hear frequent arguments involving shouting, banging and swearing. 'The last of such arguments was heard during the night of April 11. A male voice was heard to shout and swear and a female voice was heard to be crying and shouting back.' Mr Goose also told the jury that Kristal was seen at home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, by a midwife and health visitor. She was weighed and examined and it was noticed that she was losing weight in the weeks up to her death. The court heard a health visitor attended the family home eight days before her death and again two days before her death - but apart from losing weight, explained by Hopkinson and Davison as the baby vomiting, there were no injuries noticed by the health visitor. Kristal was also seen by a GP on April 3 - but 'nothing unusual' was noticed by the doctor during a physical check, the jury was told. At just before 7am on April 12, Davison called 999 and paramedics were sent to the house. They found Kristal on her back in the bathroom where Davison was attempting to resuscitate her with directions over the phone. He told paramedics that he had been up all night watching her. Kristal was rushed to hospital but despite the efforts of medical staff, died at 2.50am the next day. Mr Goose said: 'The opinion of the pathologist is that Kristal was subjected to at least two and quite possibly more episodes of trauma at different times to different parts of her body, including her head, rib cage and left leg. 'At the very least, say the prosecution, the defendants should have been aware, if they were not inflicting these injuries, that Kristal needed help. 'If either of the defendants was not involved in causing such catastrophic injuries to Kristal, then it was a simple task to remove her fro the violence being inflicted by the perpetrator. 'How difficult could it have been to take Kristal away from the house to a place of safety if there was any risk of serious injury being caused to her?' The court heard that, during interviews, Davison told the police he did not know how his daughter had been injured. But later, he went on to say how Hopkinson had 'slammed the baby' into the changing mat and sofa. Hopkinson also at first denied knowing how Kristal’s injuries had occurred, but then told police Davison would shake the baby to wake her up. She also later requested another interview with police, telling them: 'It was Lee who did it', describing hearing 'bangs' while he and Kristal were in another room. Mr Goose added: 'How could these defendants not have known how those injuries were caused? 'How difficult would it have been, you may ask yourselves, to have sought help for Kristal? 'There were plenty of opportunities - telling the health visitor when she visited, telling the GP at the doctors, talking to their parents who lived nearby and were in regular contact, simply picking Krystal up and walking out of that house, to be away from the perpetrator of the cruel violence. 'Whether they caused Kristal’s death themselves, separately or together, or they failed to take all reasonable steps to protect her from the serious and obvious risk of injury to her at the hands of the other, the prosecution say that they are both guilty of causing or allowing the death of Kristal Davison.' Both deny causing or allowing the death of a child. The trial continues.

"A picture has emerged of gun victim Reeva Steenkamp blasting a pistol almost identical to the the one that killed her, at a firing range. Holding a steady arm, Reeva takes aim for the target, using both hands to clasp a 9mm handgun similar to the one South African police recovered from the home of Oscar Pistorius. The pretty blonde ensures she is fully prepared for the target practice, with ear muffs and protective glasses intact. Used to guns? This picture may give a clue into how aware Steenkamp was with the gun culture of South Africa . Evidence: A police officer holds the pistol that was allegedly used in the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp . The 'Blade Runner' is on bail awaiting trial for the murder of the former model after she was shot four times at his property on Valentine's Day. It is believed Pistorius' defence will be that he mistook her for an intruder. The picture could shed light on how connected Reeva was with guns, and that she was comfortable with her boyfriend owning one and keeping it in the house. The outing to the firing range is believe to have occurred some months before Steenkamp began dating London 2012 Olympian Pistorius. What's the story? Pistorius is on bail, accused of the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp (both pictured at an awards ceremony in Johannesburg) Guns are owned by many homeowners in Pretoria owing to the high-rate of crime, including burglary, and it is believed Pistorius owned more than one of the weapons, as well as keeping a cricket bat by his bed. Pistorius held a memorial service at his Uncle Arnold's house in Pretoria this week, and is believed to be ready to resume his training after asking for his bail conditions to be altered. It is thought that the trial could be up to a year in waiting after the double-amputee was granted bail after a two-hour court hearing a week ago. Desmond Nair, who reached the decision, deemed Pistorius not to be a flight risk, and was unlikely to commit further acts of violence when released from custody. Conditions . of his release include that he surrenders his passports and travel . documents, does not visit his house where the model died and does not . use any prohibited substances. He is also banned from drinking alcohol. Denial: Pistorius denies that he murdered his girlfriend, and his defence is expected to be that he thought she was an intruder . Pistorius, is charged with one count of premeditated murder over the February 14 killing of the FHM cover girl. He says the shooting was accidental because he thought she was a dangerous intruder inside his home. Mr Nair said Pistorius' affidavit, in which he gave his version of the events of the shooting in a sworn statement, had helped his application for bail in Pretoria Magistrate's Court. Rumours regarding the personal lives of the famous couple have been well documented. Needles and substances found at the property that were allegedly pointing towards testosterone injections have since being discounted as being used for a herbal remedy to aid muscle recovery. And in the last few days another rumour doing that rounds that Reeva was pregnant at the time of the shooting has been fiercely denied by the deceased's family who have said that the post mortem proved this was not the case.","Model looks every inch the accomplished shooter as she takes a steady aim at range .

"Acclaimed author Anthony Horowitz believes parts of the internet are ‘foul, disgusting and cruel’ and that ‘evil is getting the upper hand’. In a powerful speech yesterday, the best-selling children’s adventure writer said the web ‘unlocked something quite dark in humanity’. He said: ‘There is so much in the internet that is foul and disgusting and cruel. It’s an interesting mix.’ Upper hand: Anthony Horowitz believes that the internet has unlocked something cruel in humanity . Speaking at the Oxford Literary Festival, the Foyle’s War and Midsomer Murders author conceded that the internet was the greatest invention of his lifetime but said it was also frightening. The 57-year-old creator of the Alex Rider and The Power of Five series said there is a ‘constant struggle within  people themselves and society for good and evil’ and that the internet is part of this. He said his passionate feelings on the subject arose in part from vicious online comments he received after a recent television appearance. Using the examples of church sex scandals, politicians’ expenses and phone-hacking, he added: ‘In the last few  years every single pillar of society has collapsed one after the other. ‘I can’t remember as a boy growing up that so many  pillars were found to be so rotten. Targeted online: Anthony Horowitz received abusive comments, pictured with his wife Jill Green . ‘It does bother me that evil is getting the upper hand.’ But he said that when writing his children’s novels, his belief in the inherent goodness of young people prevailed, and he made sure his characters saved the day. When asked about writing ‘evil’ characters, Horowitz said he tried not to make them too ‘other-worldly’, but based them on real-life drug dealers, businessmen or politicians. The married father-of-two does not believe that young readers should be ‘patronised’. He said: ‘I have very strong opinions about violence in books. There isn’t enough of it.’ And he joked about his  ‘violent rows’ with publishers about some of the scenes in his novels.He also spoke of the need to encourage more children to read for pleasure. One way of achieving that, he said, would be for pupils to have one hour of reading for pleasure a week, with a full-time state-funded librarian in every school. He added: ‘It’s worrying that a great many children leave school without reading a book cover to cover. ‘In some schools, you read a chapter or page and just try to find out what the author  was thinking about. You lose  the pleasure of reading for absorption.’ Last week Horowitz said the current series of the detective drama Foyle’s War will probably be his last. The ITV drama – now set in the Cold War – returned to  television this month after a long absence. But he told the Radio Times in an interview: ‘Nothing is ever certain – and Foyle’s War can always return without me – but I think this series will be my last. ‘I’ve written 22 episodes. That’s an awful lot of crimes, clues, bodies, suspects,  mysteries and chases,’ he said of the drama, which was first shown in 2002. Pleasure: Horowitz believes that children should be encouraged to read for fun not just education . ‘Although I’ve had great support from the Imperial War Museum, I’ve still read four or five books for every episode and frankly there’s no more room on my shelves.’ Horowitz said he thought the current eighth series was his ‘best work’ but he added: ‘It might be best to quit while we’re ahead.

"Sean Rigg, 40, a paranoid schizophrenic, died in police custody after being 'unnecessarily' restrained in police custody. Today two officers have been arrested for perverting the course of justice in relation to Mr Rigg's inquest . Two Metropolitan Police policemen and a retired officer have been arrested on suspicion of perverting the court of justice by investigators probing the death of a musician in police custody. The Independent Police Complaints Commission made the arrests following an investigation launched following a damning inquest last August which ruled that 40-year-old Sean Rigg died after officers used unnecessary force to restrain him. The arrests are connected with evidence given at the inquest. Mr Rigg's family had called for criminal charges to be brought against those responsible. An IPCC spokesman today confirmed that an unnamed police Sergeant, 50, was arrested at work, a 29-year-old PC was arrested in South London and a retired PC, 48, was arrested by appointment at a London police station. The spokesman added: 'All three are being questioned by IPCC investigators at a central London police station. 'IPCC investigators have carried out searches at their home addresses and the serving officers' workplaces. 'Mr Rigg's family have been told about today's developments through their solicitors.' The inquest jury returned a scathing verdict about police actions, saying they contributed to the death of the musician while in custody at Brixton Police Station in south London. The jury at Southwark Coroner's Court found that police used unsuitable and unnecessary force, with officers failing to uphold the detained man's basic rights as he collapsed after being pinned down for eight minutes. Mr Rigg's family pictured speaking to press after the inquest last August . Mr Rigg, who had paranoid schizophrenia, was living in a south London hostel in August 2008 as his mental health deteriorated. He smashed up a gazebo at the hostel and made karate moves which staff saw as threatening. They called the police, who did not initially respond to several pleas for help. Three hours after the first 999 call police responded, and three officers restrained Rigg. The jury found that the Metropolitan Police made a catalogue of errors which 'more than minimally' contributed to his death.
