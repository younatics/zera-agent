"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Rick Norsigian kept two boxes he bought at a garage sale under his pool table for four years before realizing they may be too valuable to store at home. The Fresno, California, commercial painter learned this week that what was in those boxes he paid $45 dollars for a decade ago could be worth more than $200 million. ""When I heard that $200 million, I got a little weak,"" Norsigian said at a Beverly Hills art gallery Tuesday. Art, forensic, handwriting and weather experts teamed up to conclude the 65 glass plates in the boxes were photographic negatives created more than 80 years ago by Ansel Adams, the iconic American photographer whose images of the West inspired the country. Arnold Peter, the lawyer who led the effort to authenticate that the negatives were made by the man known as the father of American photography, said their approach was ""to put these negatives on trial."" Experts, including a former FBI agent and a U.S. attorney, ""came to the conclusion that, based on the evidence which was overwhelming, that no reasonable person would have any doubt that these, in fact, were the long-lost images of Ansel Adams,"" Arnold said. The photographs were from the early career of the famed nature photographer, a period that is not well documented since a 1937 darkroom fire destroyed 5,000 of his plates, Arnold said. ""It truly is a missing link of Ansel Adams and history and his career,"" said Beverly Hills appraiser and art dealer David W. Streets. The photographs were taken between 1919 and the early 1930s at locations familiar to Adams, mostly around Yosemite, California, Streets said. ""This is going to show the world the evolution of his eye, of his talent, of his skill, his gift, but also his legacy,"" Streets said. ""And it's a portion that we thought had been destroyed in the studio fire."" Norsigian, who scours garage sales for antiques, was looking for a barber chair when he spotted to two deteriorated boxes in the spring of 2000. ""When I pulled on of those glass negatives out, I seen Yosemite,"" he said. ""As a young man, I worked at Yosemite quite a bit. So, right away I recognized it as Yosemite."" He bickered with the seller, finally negotiating down from $70 to $45 for the boxes. The owner said he bought them in the 1940s at a warehouse salvage in Los Angeles. He bickered the price down from $70 to $45. It would be two years before he realized they photos may be from Adams, he said. After four years, he had done enough research to realize the plates could be valuable. He moved them from under his pool table and placed them in a bank vault. How these 6.5 x 8.5 inch glass plate negatives of famous Yosemite landscapes and San Francisco landmarks -- some of them with fire damage -- made their way from Adams collection 70 years ago to a Southern California garage sale in 2000 can only be guessed. Photography expert Patrick Alt, who helped confirm the authenticity of the negatives, suspects Adams carried them to use in a photography class he was teaching in Pasadena, California, in the early 1940s. ""It is my belief that he brought these negatives with him for teaching purposes and to show students how to not let their negatives be engulfed in a fire,"" Alt said. ""I think this clearly explains the range of work in these negatives, from very early pictorialist boat pictures, to images not as successful, to images of the highest level of his work during this time period."" Alt said it is impossible to know why Adams would store them in Pasadena and never reclaim them. The plates were individually wrapped in newspaper inside deteriorating manila envelopes. Notations on each envelope appeared to have been made by Virginia Adams, the photographer's wife, according to handwriting experts Michael Nattenberg and Marcel Matley. They compared them to samples provided by the Adams' grandson. While most of the negatives appear never to have been printed, several are nearly identical to well-known Adams prints, the experts said. Meteorologist George Wright studied clouds and snow cover in a Norsigian negative to conclude that it was taken at about the same time as a known Adams photo of a Yosemite tree. In addition to Yosemite -- the California wilderness that Adams helped conserve -- the negatives depict California's Carmel Mission, views of a rocky point in Carmel, San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, a sailing yacht at sea and an image of sand dunes. ""The fact that these locations were well-known to Adams, and visited by him, further supports the proposition that all of the images in the collection were most probably created by Adams,"" said art expert Robert Moeller. Moeller said that after six months of study, he concluded ""with a high degree of probability, that the images under consideration were produced by Ansel Adams. Silver tarnishing on the negatives also helped date the plates to around the 1920s, Alt said. ""I have sent people to prison for the rest of their lives for far less evidence than I have seen in this case,"" said evidence and burden of proof expert Manny Medrano, who was hired by Norsigian to help authenticate them. ""In my view, those photographs were done by Ansel Adams."" Arnold, the lawyer, said they presented their evidence to descendants of Adams, but they've not heard back. Norsigian, who is 64, still works for the Fresno school system, but he may retire this year. It could be a while before he sees the profits from the sale of prints from the negatives, but Streets estimates over the next 25 years it could mean over $200 million for Norsigian. For now, the photos will go on a tour of universities and museums, starting in October at Fresno State University, Norsigian said, . ""I just hope everybody enjoys them,"" he said. He's not spoken with the man who sold him the two boxes a decade ago. ""If he's still around, I'm afraid he may come looking for me,"" he said.","NEW: Negatives were stored under a pool table for years .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two suspects were arrested in connection with the bombing of a mosque that killed at least 51 people, Pakistani authorities said Saturday. Friday's blast brought the roof of the mosque down on worshippers attending prayers. The two were arrested about 30 minutes after the Friday bombing after police spotted them fleeing the scene, said local official Rahat Gul. The suspects were being questioned about the deadly blast that also wounded more than 100 people. The blast occurred at Jamrod in northwest Pakistan, near the Afghanistan border. This is the latest assault in a region populated by Islamic militants in Pakistani safe havens along the Afghan border, where NATO and the U.S.-led coalition have been battling Taliban and al Qaeda militants. The bombed-out mosque had been frequented by Pakistani security officials who work at checkpoints along the route used by NATO to carry supplies from Pakistan into Afghanistan. The strike came hours before President Barack Obama explained his new urgent strategy for fighting Islamic militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan -- the latest in a long line of attacks in the region that have been staged on days of political importance in the volatile Afghan and Pakistani region. The two-story mosque had been packed with about 250 worshippers attending Friday prayers when the bomber, thought to be among the worshippers, detonated the explosive, authorities said. The building collapsed as the explosion rippled through the structure, and rescue crews deployed to the scene were searching through the rubble for more victims.","Two arrested over attack on Pakistan mosque .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Marine Corps reservist jailed in Mexico for almost three months is said to be upbeat and healthy, according to two U.S. lawmakers who visited Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi over the weekend. Republican Rep. Ed Royce of California, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Republican Rep. Matt Salmon from Arizona, chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, traveled to Tecate, Mexico, on Saturday to meet with Tahmooressi. The decorated Marine has been jailed in Mexico on weapons charges since April 1 after driving his truck into Tijuana -- he says accidentally -- with three personal fire arms, including a shotgun, .45 caliber pistol and an AR-15. All of the guns were legally registered in the United States. But in Mexico, firearm possession is almost completely illegal. Tahmooressi was said to be in good spirits, Royce said in a statement. A photo of Tahmooressi, standing in between the two lawmakers, was posted to the Twitter page of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It showed what appears to be a healthy Tahmooressi with a slight smile on his face. ""After visiting with Sgt. Tahmooressi for the second time in two weeks, I remain confident that his situation is improving and will end with his release in the near future,"" Salmon said in a statement. ""His spirits remain upbeat and he has full confidence in his new attorney,"" he added. Tahmooressi is now on his third attorney, Tijuana-based lawyer Fernando Benitez, said his mother, Jill Tahmooressi. The first two defense attorneys were dismissed by the family after a conflict of how to proceed with the Marine's legal defense, the family told CNN. ""Last week, Andrew was despondent because for a portion of it, he was without legal representation. We're more optimistic now,"" his mother said in a phone call with CNN. But more than 80 days since he was first imprisoned, Tahmooressi's defense still has not submitted evidence to the court to counter the prosecutor's evidence, his mother told CNN. ""With Mr. Benitez on the case, it's a good thing,"" she said. ""He's a veteran Tijuana attorney not fearful to take on high-profile cases. His strategy is competent."" Tahmooressi was initially held in Tijuana's La Mesa Penitentiary for the first month. There, his family says, he was subjected to torture by the prison guards and inmates. ""He told me that he tried to kill himself [while he was in La Mesa] because they were going to torture him for information about our family,"" his mother told CNN. ""By the grace of God he didn't hit an artery [when he tried to slice his neck]."" Now in El Hongo Penitentiary in Tecate, Mexico, about an hour and a half east of Tijuana, Tahmooressi is said to be doing well, according to his family. While U.S. lawmakers continue to work with Mexican officials, it remains unclear when Tahmooressi might have a court hearing.","Two U.S. lawmakers visit jailed Marine Coprs reservist in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Five University of Calgary students were stabbed to death Tuesday morning in what the city's police chief called ""the worst mass murder in Calgary's history."" Chief Rick Hanson said about 30 students were at a house party celebrating the end of the school year Monday night when police received a call at 1:20 a.m. Tuesday for a stabbing. Arriving officers discovered three men dead. A woman and another man who were found injured with stab wounds later died at the hospital, according to Hanson. ""The scene was horrific"" he said. Matthew de Grood, a fellow university student, was charged with five counts of first-degree murder Tuesday afternoon. Hanson said de Grood ""obtained a large knife"" at the house and began attacking his victims shortly after he arrived. ""He targeted the victims one by one, stabbing them several times"" said Hanson. There was no known altercation between de Grood -- who was an invited guest -- and any of his victims leading up to the attack, Hanson said. He does not know why they were targeted. The victims, who have not been named, ranged in age from 22 to 27. ""These were all good kids"" said Hanson. ""They did nothing wrong."" De Grood, 22, is the son of a longtime Calgary police officer. ""(The suspect's parents) are absolutely devastated"" said Hanson. ""They feel so much pain for the families impacted by their son. They are heartbroken."" Hanson said the suspect had had no previous run-ins with police. ""This is a very shocking and tragic day for our students and our entire university family,"" said university President Elizabeth Cannon. ""Our thoughts and condolences go out to the families of those who have lost their loved ones in this unimaginable and senseless tragedy."" A Calgary police statement says the identities of the victims will be released pending the completion of the autopsies, which is expected Wednesday. After school stabbing, community asks ""why?""

"(CNN) -- Mourners packed church pews Tuesday at a memorial service for seven victims slain in a shooting rampage at a small religious college in Oakland, California. ""We realize that at this time we have to draw together, uniting for peace, praying for peace in our city, and praying to stop the violence,"" said a woman who introduced various parts of the service. Meanwhile, authorities continued searching for the weapon a gunman used Monday when he killed seven people execution-style at Oikos University. Accused shooter One Goh gave some details to investigators about Monday's attack, but refused to say where he disposed of the gun, police said. Investigators had narrowed their search for the weapon and were combing a shoreline park area Tuesday, police spokeswoman Johnna Watson told reporters. Forensic investigators were still at the scene of the shooting Tuesday, she said. Police plan to present the case to the district attorney for possible charges sometime this week, she said. ""It's a large investigation. We want to be thorough,"" she said. Goh was being held Tuesday in Alameda County's Santa Rita Jail pending an initial appearance in court this week. The 43-year-old former student at the college ""does not appear to be remorseful at all,"" Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan said. Police: Suspect was angry over college expulsion . Goh told authorities that he was upset about being expelled from Oikos University this year, Jordan said. Investigators believe Goh walked into the single-story building housing the university Monday morning, took a secretary hostage and went looking for a particular female administrator, who was not there, Jordan told CNN. Goh took the secretary into the classroom, but when he realized the administrator was not there, he shot her and ordered the students to line up against the wall. Not all of them cooperated, Jordan said, and so he began shooting. ""I'm going to kill you all,"" the gunman said, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. ""This was a calculated, cold-blooded execution in the classroom,"" Jordan said. The suspect ""just felt a certain urge to inflict pain on them,"" he said. After the shooting, the man left the classroom, reloaded his semiautomatic weapon and returned, firing into several classrooms, Jordan said. He ended his rampage by driving off in a victim's car, police said. In all, seven people were killed and three were wounded. ""This happened within minutes,"" Jordan said. ""We don't think the victims had any opportunity to resist, any opportunity to surrender."" The suspect was arrested a short time after the shooting, when he surrendered to police at a grocery store in the Oakland suburb of Alameda, Jordan said. Goh offered no resistance when arrested, Jordan said, and was ""very cooperative, very matter-of-fact, very calm."" Under questioning, Goh ""remembered very good details"" about the incident, he said. ""He planned this several weeks in advance,"" Jordan told KTVU on Tuesday. ""He was so upset he went out and purchased a weapon and had every intent to kill people yesterday."" All three of those wounded were released from Oakland's Highland Hospital on Monday night, spokeswoman Monique Binkley Smith said Tuesday. Oakland Mayor Jean Quan condemned the violence. ""No American mayor wants to have this situation,"" she said. ""It seems over the last decade, we've gotten used to seeing senseless mass killings like this, and we'll have to question the availability of guns and the need for other services in our community."" Investigators have determined that the gun they believe Goh used was obtained legally in California, but details about the weapon's purchase were still under investigation, Watson said. Harrowing descriptions of chaotic scenes inside and outside the college emerged Tuesday. Audio recordings of police radio exchanges released Tuesday include a dispatcher describing reports of shots coming from inside the building. ""People are running out, screaming,"" she says. ""There's a female bleeding down on the ground, face down on the concrete,"" a dispatcher says. An officer at the scene describes a man who has a gunshot wound to his head. ""We were able to extricate one body, a victim from the building, the victim still has a faint pulse. We're waking her up now,"" another officer says. Art Richards told CNN he was on his way to pick up a friend and thought the commotion outside the school was caused by a car accident. Then, he said, a woman emerged from bushes and told him she had been shot. ""I was kind of mind-boggled,"" he said, but the woman showed him her arm. ""She had a good little piece, a chunk of her arm, missing."" Police handcuffed one man outside the school, but the woman told authorities he was not the shooter, Richards said. ""Right after that, close to seven, eight, nine shots rang out,"" he said. ""Everybody got down. The police took cover. We took cover."" A few minutes after that, the first body was brought out, he said. ""They were just pulling out bodies after bodies."" Brian Snow said he was at a nearby credit union when shots rang out. ""I went outside and the cops were coming and like 'Don't move, don't move,' and it started getting chaotic. ... A pedestrian came out with a bullet hole,"" he said. Meanwhile, inside the college, survivors hid behind locked doors or desks as gunfire erupted. Tashi Wangzon said that his wife, a student there, heard the shots, then locked the door to her classroom and turned off the lights. ""The man with the gun later came toward the room and, at the time, he fired several rounds at the door,"" Wangzon told KGO. ""Then he left (when he thought nobody was there)."" Lucas Garcia, who was teaching an English class at the college when the rampage began, told KGO that he counted about six gunshots from a nearby nursing classroom and heard someone yell, ""He's got a gun."" Garcia said he got his students out of the building while the gunfire continued. What is Oikos University? The college caters to the Korean-American Christian community but also has students from diverse backgrounds. It offers degrees in theology, music, nursing and Asian medicine, according to its website. The victims of Monday's shooting ranged in age from 21 to 40 and were from countries including Korea, Nepal, Nigeria and the Philippines, Jordan said. With the exception of the secretary, all the victims were students. Of those killed, six were women and one was a man, but Jordan said investigators do not know whether Goh was targeting women. Quan, Oakland's mayor, said most of the victims appeared to be from the city's Korean-American community, and the city was working to find multilingual counselors to help survivors. Community and faith leaders were scheduled to attend Tuesday's memorial, and they hope to develop a strategy for dealing with the situation, said June Lee, executive director of the Oakland-based Korean Community Center of the East Bay. ""We're looking for a way to help the families and the community that are impacted by this incident,"" she said. Civic and church leaders will try to come up with a community strategy to deal with the tragedy, she said. But she stressed the importance of not stigmatizing Koreans or Asians. ""This is all new to us. We don't want to stigmatize whatever the issue is. ... We need to identify the issues first,"" she said. CNN's Michael Martinez, Sara Weisfeldt, Matt Smith, Alan Duke, Paul Vercammen, Dan Simon and Augie Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We have to draw together, uniting for peace,"" a woman says at service .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Russia is displaying its military power in America's back yard, sending a convoy of warships to Venezuela for joint naval exercises, the first such deployment since the Cold War. The Kremlin is becoming increasingly cozy with Venezuela, Cuba and other Latin American countries unhappy with the United States, in apparent response to thorny issues such as U.S. missile defense plans in Eastern Europe, NATO's eastern expansion, and U.S. warships dispatched to Georgia. ""Some of this is the Russians wanting to get even. They see American warships close to their shore; they're going to put Russian warships close to us,"" said Russian military expert John Pike of globalsecurity.org. The fleet of ships headed toward the Caribbean includes some of Russia's finest, like the nuclear-powered Peter the Great cruiser and the anti-submarine warship Admiral Chebanenko. Pike said that while these vessels are impressive, they are no match for the American Navy and pose little threat to the United States. ""They have obsolete technology. They would simply be no match for American warships in a one-to-one combat,"" he said. Nonetheless, this deployment adds to the tension created earlier this month when two Russian Tu-160 nuclear long-range bombers arrived in Venezuela, also for military exercises. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a vocal critic of the United States, greeted the Russian pilots with a blunt message for Washington. ""Venezuela is not alone! Russia is with us,"" he said. ""They are our strategic partners. The Russian Tu-160 bombers on our land are a warning to the empire of the U.S.A.!"" Chavez is increasing Venezuela's ties with Russia. He arrived in Moscow on Thursday for his second trip there in the past two months. Russia, meanwhile, has sold Venezuela more than $4 billion in arms. U.S. Defense Department spokesman Geoff Morrell says the Pentagon is not fazed. ""Russia is certainly within its rights to conduct exercises with its allies. What's the old saying? You're sort of known by the company you keep. If they wish to hang out with the Venezuelan navy, that's their business,"" he said. But Russia knows the United States is watching, and that seems to be the idea, Pike said. ""The Russians, sort of from here on out, every couple months are going to come up with some sort of new event, some sort of new exercise, some sort of new provocation to keep us focused on them,"" he said .","Russian warships heading to Venezuela for joint naval exercises .

"(CNN) -- Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group active in Somalia, is not responsible for a terrorist attack in Kenya's coastal town of Mpeketoni that killed at least 48 people, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said Tuesday. Instead, he blames local political networks for the attack Sunday that witnesses say turned a World Cup viewing party into a bloodbath. Armed men stormed the city center, shooting and hacking people to death before moving into a residential area, where they went from door to door, the witnesses said. ""The attack was well planned, orchestrated and politically motivated ethnic violence against the Kenyan community with the intention of victimization for political reasons. This therefore was not an Al-Shabaab terrorist attack,"" Kenyatta said. The heavily armed gunmen, many in military uniforms, attacked hotels, a restaurant, gas station, bank, police station and a government office, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. Video from the scene showed burned-out vehicles and walls pockmarked by bullets. ""Those unwilling to work to unite Kenyans will not have the space, nor the room, for hate speech,"" Kenyatta said. There were no claims of responsibility for the attack, but the Kenyan Disaster Operation Centre had blamed it on Al-Shabaab. Mpeketoni sits to the west of the Kenya-Somalia border, where the Kenyan army is fighting troops loyal to the al Qaeda-linked militant group. CNN's Joyce Joseph, Lillian Leposo, Ralph Ellis and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.","Kenya's President says local terrorists attacked a coastal city Sunday, killing at least 48 people .

"(CNN) -- Like most couples, my wife and I were discussing marriage before we officially got engaged. But we discovered that we could not keep our private information private. Once we started discussing engagement rings in (supposedly) private Facebook messages to each other, my Web browser became inundated with engagement ring advertisements. From then on, anyone in the same room with me knew our plans. The aphorism is true: If you're not paying for the product or service, you are the product or service being sold. Like most people who use computers, the information in your private message or Web search is being sold to an advertiser. The ads continue to follow you around, popping up at the most inopportune moments when a friend, relative or co-worker happens to be near your screen. We get Facebook for free, and we do our Web searches for free, but the price we pay is our personal data, which are used by advertisers to entice us to buy things that they think we want. It doesn't have to be this way. I would gladly pay a reasonable fee to Facebook and Google if they would allow me to keep my private information private. I'm hardly alone in my disenchantment with the tech world's use of people's personal information. Embarrassing and out-of-context Web advertisements are affecting nearly everyone who uses the Internet these days. My friend Jim Trammell, a college professor in High Point, North Carolina, who is happily married to a woman, once wrote a paper about how homosexual Christians are covered in evangelical magazines, which required online research. ""I felt like I was getting ads about gay-friendly vacations and dating services for months,"" he told me. ""Fortunately, Mrs. Trammell knew about my project."" Alyssa Richter, a magazine editor in Lexington, Kentucky, was recently looking for baby shower gifts for a pregnant friend. Right on cue, her Web browser became flooded with neverending ads for parenting magazines and onesies. ""My husband saw them on my computer and was like, 'Is there something you're not telling me?' "" she said. Although these examples are innocuous and even humorous, other targeted advertisements based on (ostensibly) private information can seem intrusive or disturbing. A friend of mine who asked that I not use her name told me about an experience she had when she discovered that she was pregnant. Not surprisingly, she immediately began conducting Web searches related to her pregnancy. Excited and happy, she and her husband started making plans for the baby. If that were the end of the story, the targeted ads would have been fine. But she miscarried. And the targeted ads kept coming. ""It was hard for me even though it was such a short-lived pregnancy,"" she said. ""It was like rubbing salt in the wound."" The programs that scan your Web activities do not discriminate. Being non-human, they cannot show sensitivity or propriety. Any clue you've given is fair game. Distressed about a dying relative? Don't be surprised to see ads from funeral homes. Planning to buy your spouse a surprise gift? It won't be a surprise when an ad for that specific gift pops up suspiciously on your browser the next day, when the two of you are sharing the computer. I should add that it's not just Google and Facebook that engage in these practices. Many websites choose to run ads that are specifically targeted toward users. I'm always fascinated by the way people rush to defend the reigning tech companies. One example: No one is forcing you to use these websites. True, but that's sort of the same thing as telling a person in a small city with no public transportation that they're not legally required to get a car. If you want to participate in normal daily life, what other option do you have? Another example is the ""terms of service"" defense. If you use Facebook or Google, you have agreed to their terms of service. That may be true from a strictly legal standpoint, but from a practical standpoint, this defense falls apart. As Alexis Madrigal pointed out in an article in The Atlantic, reading all the privacy policies you encounter in a typical year would take many days. Finally, there's the ""opt out"" defense, which goes something like this: ""Hey, the tech companies aren't trying to get you to do anything you don't want to do. You can adjust your privacy settings."" Right. Really? Tech companies have their own interests to look over. That's why, despite a class-action settlement meant to ensure Facebook users' agreement to their ""likes"" being used in ads, the practice continues under the radar. The public has been whipped into a frenzy lately by revelations of NSA overreach. It's interesting to me that people aren't equally concerned about privacy violations by tech companies. ""Don't be evil,"" Google used to say. OK. That's admirable. But that's also a pretty low standard. How about adding an additional goal: Do more good. ""Facebook is free, and always will be."" Great. Continue to offer the free version for people who don't care about their privacy. I'll take the ""Premium"" version, pay for it with actual money and keep my personal information to myself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David R. Wheeler.","David Wheeler: When I go online, data from my private messages are sold to advertiser .

"(CNN) -- A lawsuit filed by Academy Award winning screenwriter and celebrated director Quentin Tarantino against the Gawker website for linking to a script for a future movie project was dismissed Tuesday by a federal judge. In January, Gawker posted links to the script for ""The Hateful Eight,"" an unproduced Western. Tarantino failed to prove that was an act of direct copyright infringement, said Judge John F. Walter of the Central District of California. The judge said he would allow Tarantino's attorney to amend arguments and refile the complaint by May 1. Although Gawker did not post the script to its own site, Tarantino's attorney charged the script would not have been widely accessible if Gawker had not linked to it. Gawker turned down repeated requests to remove links to download the script, Tarantino's complaint charged. Tarantino told the gossip site Deadline that he had given the script to only six people, including actors Michael Madsen, best known as the killer in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" as well as Bruce Dern and Tim Roth. ""Reservoir Dogs"" was Roth's breakthrough film. Somehow, the script leaked. It was posted through a site that lets users anonymously upload and download files. CNN's attempts to reach Tarantino for comment on Tuesday were unsuccessful. Gawker didn't mention the decision on its website. According to CNN affiliate KTLA, Tarantino held a three-hour reading of the script over the weekend and told audience members he was working on changes to it. Although Tarantino had spoken of shelving the project when the links to the script were posted, he said making the film is still possible.","Links to an unproduced movie script were posted in January .

"(CNN) -- Despite being a sport well into its seventh decade, only two women have ever driven in Formula 1 but Susie Wolff is hoping she may just become the third. On Monday, it was announced that the Scottish driver will become the first woman to take part in a F1 event of any kind in 22 years. Already a development driver with British team Williams, the 31-year-old is scheduled to take part in the first practice sessions ahead of the British and Germans grands prix in July. The last woman to drive an F1 car during a race weekend was Italy's Giovanna Amati, who failed to qualify at Interlagos in Brazil while driving for Brabham in 1992. However, you have to go back to 1976 to find the last grand prix featuring a female driver when Lella Lombardi finished an F1 career that had started two years earlier. Prior to that, another Italian -- Maria Teresa di Filippis -- raced for Maserati three times in 1958. Now Wolff has been given the chance to follow in their footsteps, even if such a prospect may take some time. 'I'm grateful for the support and belief Williams continue to show in me and 2014 promises to be a very important milestone in my career,"" Wolff told the manufacturer's website. ""My responsibilities within the team have steadily increased as I have proved myself, culminating in the opportunity to test the car at Silverstone and conduct straight line aero tests last season. ""Competing in two (practice) sessions, alongside an additional full test day this season will be a big step and I am looking forward to the opportunity to get behind the wheel on a grand prix weekend. ""It's a challenge that I will relish and it will be a great chance for me to continue assisting the team.'' In a separate interview, Wolff stated that the possibility of taking part in practice sessions on a Friday meant she had to be eyeing up a chance at driving on the Sunday. ""If you can take part in the Friday practice sessions, then of course you have to be looking at doing an actual race,"" she told the British Press Association. Growing Presence . This may well be some time off though, with Brazilian Felipe Massa and Finland's Valtteri Bottas the two designated drivers for the forthcoming season. Wolff is not even the team's reserve driver since that role is taken by another Brazilian, 21-year-old Felipe Nasr. Having competed in the German Touring Car championship (DTM) for seven years, the Scot is married to Toto Wolff, a former Williams executive director who now holds that role at Mercedes. Yet Williams' Chief Technical Officer Pat Symonds is adamant that Wolff deserves her place in the paddock.

"Washington (CNN) -- A new poll Tuesday showed voters are willing to give Mitt Romney a fresh look now that he is the certain Republican presidential nominee, and the former Massachusetts governor picked up public backing from the top GOP leaders in the House and Senate. The good news came as Romney's campaign offered a mild rebuke to right-wing rocker Ted Nugent's for his latest inflammatory rhetoric against President Barack Obama, seeking a middle ground between condoning divisive language and alienating conservatives who like Nugent's firebrand politics. Obama, meanwhile, unveiled a new plan to limit oil market speculation as a way to address high gas prices angering Americans as the campaign for the November election heats up. The CNN/ORC International poll showed that Romney's popularity is starting to rebound now that the divisiveness of the Republican primaries appears to be all but over. According to the survey, 44% of people questioned said they have a favorable view of Romney, up 10 points from February, while 43% said they have an unfavorable opinion, down 11 points, and 13% were unsure. According to the poll, 53% of Americans plan to give Romney a second look when the primaries are officially over, with 45% saying they already know enough about Romney to decide whether he would be a good president. The survey indicates Romney's popularity still lags well behind Obama's: 56% have a favorable view of the president, with 42% saying they see Obama in a negative light. ""The Republican Party's favorable rating has also rebounded now that the nomination fight is all but over, from 35% in March to 41%,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""That still puts the GOP several points behind the Democratic party's 46% rating, but it is an indication that the wounds have started to heal from the primary season."" CNN Poll: Romney's favorable rating rebounds . Both House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Tuesday they back Romney's nomination. The statements a few hours apart were intended to show growing Republican support for Romney despite mistrust among some conservatives over his moderate policies when he was Massachusetts governor. ""I will be proud to support Mitt Romney and do everything I can to help him win,"" Boehner told reporters after he met with House Republicans to discuss the November election. Romney still needs several hundred delegates to formally secure the GOP nomination, but the withdrawal from the race last week by his main conservative challenger, Rick Santorum, left Romney's path unobstructed. McConnell later told reporters he also is backing Romney, which is no surprise but represents a formal endorsement after the Kentucky senator previously said Romney would be the party's nominee and ""an excellent candidate."" Nugent, another Romney supporter, raised eyebrows this weekend when he said at an NRA convention that if Obama wins re-election in November, ""I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year."" He accused the government of ""wiping its ass with the Constitution"" and labeled members of the Obama administration, including the vice president, attorney general and secretary of state, ""criminals."" ""We need to ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in November,"" Nugent said. Responding to the comments by Nugent, who announced his support for Romney last month, campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said: ""Divisive language is offensive no matter what side of the political aisle it comes from."" ""Mitt Romney believes everyone needs to be civil,"" Saul added. Her reaction followed a call from Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida for Romney to denounce comments she called ""despicable, deplorable and completely beyond the pale."" ""Romney's surrogates should know better than to rally the troops with outrageous rhetoric that is unacceptable in our political debate,"" Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. Obama said Tuesday that the new measures he announced to limit speculation in oil markets will make amends to consumers for congressional Republicans blocking an end to subsidies for oil corporations. ""A few weeks ago, Congress had the chance to stand up for families already paying an extra premium at the pump, but congressional Republicans voted to keep spending billions of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars on more unnecessary subsidies for big oil companies,"" Obama said in his announcement in the Rose Garden. ""So here's a chance to make amends."" Senate Republicans three weeks ago blocked a Democratic measure championed by Obama to end tax breaks for the major oil companies, which he said are enjoying record profits. Four Democrats crossed party lines to vote against the bill, but even if it had passed the Senate, it was given little chance in the Republican-controlled House. Obama's proposal would require traders to put up more of their own money for transactions. It also would ask for more funding for market enforcement and monitoring, and increase penalties for manipulating markets. Obama and Republicans have drawn lines over oil prices since they started to rise to near-record levels earlier this year. Republicans say Obama hasn't done enough to stem the rise and advocate opening up more areas for drilling and approving projects like the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada to refineries in Texas. But analysts say such measures would have little effect on the current price of oil and gasoline. Most Americans blame big oil for the spike in prices -- a recent CNN/ORC International poll showed that the majority blamed the oil companies while 24% blamed Obama and 21% blamed Republican policies. CNN poll: Gender gap and likeability keep Obama over Romney . Obama's announcement came a day after one of the elements of his tax policy was blocked by Republicans in the Senate. The so-called Buffett Rule -- named after billionaire Warren Buffett, who says the tax rate he pays should be no lower than that of his secretary -- failed to get the necessary 60 votes to go to the Senate floor. The measure would have raised the minimum tax rate to 30% for those making more than $1 million a year. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that Obama, by pushing the Buffett Rule, shows that the incumbent is ""out of ideas"" on the economy. Speaking to the Tax Day Tea Summit in Philadelphia on Monday night, Romney cited a calculation that the measure, which would have raised the minimum tax rate to 30% for those making between $1 million and $2 million, would have paid for ""11 hours of government."" ""This is not exactly a grand idea,"" Romney said. ""This is a man who is out of ideas, he's out of excuses and in 2012 we're going to make sure he gets put out of office."" However, a CNN/ORC poll released Monday found that seven in 10 respondents said they favored the bill. Romney's wife, Ann, was to be the guest of honor later Tuesday at a birthday celebration/fundraiser being held for her by Donald Trump's wife, Melania, at the couple's residence in Trump Tower in New York. Trump spokesman Michael Cohen said about 400 people were invited to the event, which was expected to bring in ""well in excess"" of $600,000. Cohen said Trump will stop by the fundraiser to wish Ann Romney, who turned 63 on Monday, a happy birthday and he expects to host another fundraiser for the campaign at Trump Tower once Romney officially clinches the nomination. First lady Michelle Obama will also be raising cash on Tuesday. She will speak at a Democratic National Committee event in Nashville, followed by two DNC fundraisers in Pittsburgh. Romney could cross paths with the first lady when he holds a midday campaign roundtable at a community center in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bethel Park. Pro-Obama super PAC to hit Romney on taxes .

"(CNN) -- Malcolm Glazer, owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and English soccer club Manchester United, has died aged 85. The NFL franchise released a statement on their official website announcing Glazer had passed away on Wednesday morning. One of seven children, Glazer assumed control of the Buccaneers in 1995 and they went on to claim their first Super Bowl crown in 2002. He bought English Premier League team Manchester United in 2005 in a controversial takeover that was heavily criticized by a large section of their fans for loading debt onto the club. Despite this discontent, the club continued to enjoy huge success on the field, winning five Premier League titles and one European Champions League crown under his stewardship. ""The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are saddened to announce the passing of Owner/President Malcolm Glazer earlier this morning at the age of 85,"" read the statement. ""Mr. Glazer's long established estate succession plan has assured the Buccaneers will remain with the Glazer family for generations to come. ""Linda Glazer, along with their five sons and daughter, will continue to own and operate the team as they have throughout the family's ownership."" ""A private family funeral service will be held for Mr.Glazer. The opportunity for others to remember and celebrate Mr. Glazer's life will be announced at a future date."" Glazer took control of his family's business when he was just 15, and developed a wide portfolio of international holdings as it grew exponentially. The Buccaneers had been perennial underachievers in the NFL prior to Glazer's takeover in 1995 but he transformed their fortunes and led them to a maiden Super Bowl title in 2002. His Glazer Family Foundation, which was established in 1999, has donated millions to charitable causes in the Tampa Bay area. Glazer suffered a pair of strokes in 2006, which impaired his speech and affected his mobility in his right arm and right leg. His sons have long been running both the Bucs and United. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell paid tribute to Glazer on his official Twitter account: ""Malcolm Glazer was the guiding force behind the building of a Super Bowl-champion organization,"" he said. ""His dedication to the community was evident in all he did, including his leadership in bringing Super Bowls to Tampa Bay. Malcolm's commitment to the Bucs, the NFL and the people of the Tampa Bay region are the hallmarks of his legacy."" If Glazer was lauded by Bucs fans for his achievements it was a different story in England after his purchase of Manchester United in 2005. United are one of the world's richest clubs -- behind Spanish pair Real Madrid and Barcelona in Forbes' most recent rich list with a value of $2.81 billion -- and are one of the globe's best-supported teams. Glazer had to borrow money to complete his takeover, the deal plunging the club into over $1 billion worth of debt overnight, and installed his sons Bryan, Joel and Avram to the board. Protests were widespread, fans burning effigies of Glazer outside the stadium, but despite this animosity United's success on the pitch endured. Under the stewardship of Alex Ferguson, the club won five English Premier League titles after Glazer's takeover, as well as the coveted European Champions League crown in 2008. But their fortunes nosedived after Ferguson retired at the end of the 2013/14 season. His replacement, David Moyes, lasted barely 10 months and was sacked with the club languishing in seventh. Louis Van Gaal will take over after leading Netherlands to the World Cup in Brazil, with the club desperate for a top four finish next season and a return to the lucrative Champions League. A statement on Man Utd's official website read: ""The thoughts of everyone at Manchester United are with the Glazer family tonight following the news that Malcolm Glazer has passed away. He was 85. ""The news was announced earlier on the official website of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the NFL franchise he acquired ownership of in 1995.

"(CNN) -- The wait is nearly over in a close-knit Manchester, New Hampshire, community with ties to South Sudan. Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, the Sudanese Christian woman sentenced to death in Sudan because of her faith, arrived in Rome on Thursday with her husband Daniel Wani, an American citizen who has lived in Manchester, the baby girl she gave birth to while in prison, and her toddler son. The family, which met with Pope Francis in Vatican City, is expected to the travel to the United States. ""I was crying,"" Gabriel Wani said of the predawn phone he received from his brother Daniel the other day. ""He said they were coming to New Hampshire. This is his place now."" The family's plight has long been a topic of prayer meetings and Sunday sermons, dinner-table talk and pleas to members of Congress from people in a city that has learned to embrace newcomers. Since Thursday, southern Sudanese people have been stopping by Gabriel Wani's home in Manchester, where he lives with his wife and their three daughters, with words of support. ""A lot of people have been waiting for them,"" Wani said. ""The whole community wants to welcome them."" 'Everybody comes following someone else' In 1998, Daniel Wani, his brother Gabriel and sister Mary were among the first southern Sudanese refugees to resettle in Manchester. Manchester -- with a population of about 110,000, the largest city in northern New England -- has long served as a resettlement site for refugees from dozens of countries who have been scattered throughout the United States by the State Department. Since the late 1990s, more than 500 people from what is now South Sudan were resettled in New Hampshire, the majority of them in Manchester, according to refugee advocates. Newcomers included southern Sudanese children taken as slaves during the country's most recent civil war along with a handful of the thousands of orphaned and displaced children, known as the ""Lost Boys,"" who trekked hundreds of miles to neighboring countries to escape the violence. ""Everybody comes following someone else,"" said Monyroor Teng, pastor of the Sudanese Evangelical Covenant Church, who arrived in Manchester in 2004 after spending three years as a refugee in Egypt. The church is hosting a welcoming reception for the family, said Zakaria Aging, who came to the United States from Sudan in 2000. Members of southern Sudanese community were also planning to greet them at the airport. ""I don't have any words right now,"" Aging said. Italy steps in to help . A court in Sudan overturned Ibrahim's death sentence a few weeks ago, but police arrested her again June 24 when she and her family tried to leave Sudan to go to the United States. Police accused her of falsifying travel documents in an attempt to fly to the United States with her family. They were taken into custody at the airport in the capital, Khartoum. The family had been confined to a safe house in Sudan until this week, when they traveled to Italy. A Sudanese Islamic jihadist group on Monday released a statement threatening Ibrahim, vowing to carry out what it said was the justified death sentence against her. Italy's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Lapo Pistelli said his country became involved because it was moved by Ibrahim's story. Italy maintains good relations with Khartoum and offered to help the U.S. Embassy there speed up the process of getting U.S. passports for Ibrahim and her family, the minister said. Gabriel Wani remembered speaking to his brother by phone Wednesday and being told, ""We're still waiting. We don't know what's going on."" The next day, Daniel Wani called with the news: ""We're out of the country."" ""I couldn't believe it,"" Gabriel Wani said. Pistelli said it was unclear how long the family will stay in Rome before traveling the United States because of passport procedures. Ibrahim's ordeal started when a Muslim relative filed a criminal complaint saying she had married Wani, a Christian, after going missing for several years. A Sudanese court considered Ibrahim a Muslim because her father was Muslim. She was charged with adultery on grounds that a Muslim woman's marriage to a Christian man is illegal in Sudan. Ibrahim also was charged with apostasy, accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith. In May, while about eight months pregnant, she was convicted. In chains, Ibrahim gave birth about two weeks later in a women's hospital in Khartoum. Ibrahim had been detained since mid-January. She refused to let go of her 20-month-old son Martin for fear she would never see him again. At Ibrahim's sentencing, a sheikh told the court ""how dangerous a crime like this is to Islam and the Islamic community,"" said attorney Mohamed Jar Elnabi, who represented Ibrahim. ""I am a Christian,"" Ibrahim fired back, ""and I will remain a Christian."" Ibrahim was born to a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother. Her father left when she was 6 years old. She was raised by her mother as a Christian. Her father was Muslim, so the courts considered her the same, which would mean her marriage to a non-Muslim man is void. Daniel Wani is board chairman of the South Sudan Community of New Hampshire, a nonprofit that provides translators, basic English classes, tutoring for children and outreach services. ""His plan all along was to bring his family to New Hampshire,"" Gabriel Wani said.","New Hampshire city awaits Mariam Yehya Ibrahim and her family .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Police are investigating a beauty clinic in Hong Kong after four women were hospitalized with septic shock after receiving a treatment experts say is usually only administered to cancer patients. Two women, aged 46 and 60, remain in a critical condition after being admitted soon after undergoing the procedure at the DR beauty clinic last Wednesday, according to a statement from the Hong Kong Department of Health. Two other women, aged 56 and 59 are also hospitalized. The younger woman is in a serious condition, while the elder woman is said to be stable. In a statement from the health department -- which is investigating the matter -- a spokesman said patients had received what's called a DC-CIK treatment, a procedure that involves, ""concentration and processing of blood taken from the person, and subsequent infusion of the mixture back into the patient. According to the investigation, the treatment was provided by registered medical practitioner."" Experts contacted by CNN said they had never heard of DC-CIK being used on healthy people. ""Such treatment is only indicated for patients with metastatic cancer and often as salvage therapy when there are no other feasible options,"" Professor KY Yuen, Chair of Infectious Diseases at the University of Hong Kong's Department of Microbiology said in an email to CNN. It's not clear whether any of the women had been diagnosed with cancer, though the Hong Kong Health Department said in a statement that at least one woman had been in good health before the treatment. Dr. Ho Pak-leung, President of the University of Hong Kong's Center for Infection told CNN that he had not heard of any scientific evidence that DC-CIK treatment was useful for cosmetic purposes. ""I have serious doubts about the medical and scientific basis of the treatment,"" he said. In a statement, Hong Kong's Health Department said blood samples taken from one of the women showed the presence of Mycobacterium abscessus, a bacterium that can be found in water, soil and dust, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Preliminary samples from two other women produced similar findings -- testing is still under way. Dr. Ho said under normal circumstances the bacterium does not pose a danger to healthy people, and is most commonly seen in superficial wound infections. However, he added that it appears as though it had somehow entered the women's blood. ""There's a real possibility that the treatment is a direct cause of the serious illness in the four patients,"" he said. ""We don't normally see infection of the blood and internal organs in patients,"" Dr. Ho said, adding that effectively treating the condition is ""very difficult."" He said: ""Doctors are trying very hard to save the patients who came down with blood infections with this bacteria but there's a lot of uncertainty as to whether those drugs are really effective."" A Hong Kong Health Department spokesman said investigations revealed that the treatment was provided to a total of 44 women, including those hospitalized in the past week. The hospitalized women were said to have experienced a range of symptoms including headaches, fever, diarrhea and vomiting. As of late Sunday, 12 people had called a special hotline to say that they were also clients of the clinic, but no new cases of septic shock had been reported, the Health Department said. In response to media questioning on Saturday, the clinic's founder, Dr. Stephen Chow Heung-wing said that his staff referred clients to an independent doctor who administered the therapy, but denied suggestions that it was offered as a medical treatment. ""I didn't said that it can cure any diseases. Remember that, we are a beauty clinic. We refer clients to doctor(s) and we have had the clients to sign a liability-free form, which states that it is not for medical use,"" he told local media. CNN phoned Chow's office on Monday but his staff said there would be no further comment. The Health Department said the clinic had been ordered to halt the procedure. A statement on the beauty clinic's website says that the treatment ""was conducted by an independent doctor at a medical clinic, and the doctor is not hired by our beauty store."" The statement also said it was up to the independent doctor to decide whether the client is suitable for treatment before he or she receives it. It added: ""We will assist related government departments to find out the causation of this particular incident."" According to its website, the DR group of clinics was established in 1995 and provides services for more than 1,000 clients each day.

"(CNN) -- People convicted of certain sex offenses against a child in California will get life in prison without parole starting Thursday, after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed ""Chelsea's Law."" The law was named for 17-year-old Chelsea King, who was murdered this year by a registered sex offender who also admitted having killed 14-year-old Amber Dubois. ""Because of Chelsea, California children will be safer,"" Schwarzenegger said. ""Because of Chelsea, this never has to happen again."" The ""one-strike"" provision applies to forcible sex crimes against minors that include aggravating factors, such as the victim's age or whether the victim was bound or drugged. The unanimous passage of the bill by California lawmakers was a rare display of bipartisanship, spurred by outrage over the King and Dubois murders. It included an urgency clause that made it immediately effective. ""Very few things bring Democrats and Republicans together these days, but your daughters have,"" Schwarzenegger said to their parents before signing the law in a San Diego ceremony. Kelly King, Chelsea's mother, spoke after the governor. She thanked lawmakers for inspiring ""our next generation of voters by your actions."" ""You've shown them what is good and right and sound decision making in government,"" King said. The measure also puts those convicted of certain sex crimes against minors on lifetime parole. Registered sex offender John Gardner III admitted last March to the killings. A few days after King's body was found, Gardner led authorities to the remains of Dubois, who had been missing for more than a year. Gardner was sentenced in April to three consecutive terms of life without parole for the murders and an attack on a jogger in a plea deal that spared him the death penalty.","An urgency clause makes the law immediately effective .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday the United States and its allies have ""made real progress"" in talks with Iran over its nuclear program, but ""significant gaps"" remain and more work is necessary. He added in remarks at the White House that more time may be needed to continue talks beyond the July 20 deadline for a comprehensive agreement. Obama said he would continue consultations, including discussions with Congress, about whether to extend the negotiations. Obama met with John Kerry at the White House earlier in the day to review the secretary of state's discussions in recent days with other world powers negotiating with Iran along with the United States. An interim deal that took effect in January required Iran to dismantle or freeze some of its nuclear program and open it to more international inspections in return for limited relief from crippling international sanctions. Obama said that Iran has met its commitments under the interim accord. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","President Barack Obama met with Secretary of State John Kerry at the White House .

"(EW) -- If the Avengers are the New York Yankees of the Marvel universe — a collection of slick all-stars for whom victory is more or less a given — then the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" are the ""Bad News Bears."" They're a motley crew of bickering, bumbling mercenaries driven by self-interest. They may band together in the end, but it's rarely peaceful or pretty. The de facto leader of this assembly of intergalactic antiheroes is Peter Quill, a cocky Terrian (i.e., earthling) who was hoovered up into space by a colossal spaceship when he was 8 and now introduces himself as ''Star-Lord'' to the derisive laughter of his snarling alien foes. John C. Reilly shows Letterman a seriously old-school 'Guardians' clip . Twenty-six years later, he's grown into a swashbuckling fortune hunter with a maroon leather duster, a vintage Walkman loaded with classic rock, and a roguish sweet tooth for extraterrestrial hotties. Played with wily mischief by Chris Pratt, he's like Han Solo's more excitable, less responsible nephew. Joining Quill in Marvel's fizzy franchise kickoff are the green-skinned assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana); the mumbly mound of muscles Drax the Destroyer (wrestler Dave Bautista, whose physique is its own special effect); a rascally, foul-mouthed raccoon named Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper); and a walking tree creature called Groot, whose only words are ''I am Groot'' (delivered through the gruff, grunting tonsils of Vin Diesel). Directed with an effortlessly light touch by James Gunn, a low-budget maestro of genre films such as 2006's ""Slither"" and 2010's ""Super,"" ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" represents a risky proposition for Marvel on several levels: a director who's never grappled with a project of this scale before, a menagerie of comic-book characters who are hardly household names (even to fanboys), and a tongue-in-cheek B-movie vibe that's more ""Starcrash"" than ""Star Wars."" But give Marvel props, even with all of its mega-success; the studio's still willing to take chances. Here, that risk pays off big-time. The film's a giddily subversive space opera that runs on self-aware smart-assery. Which fowl Marvel character resurfaces in 'Guardians of the Galaxy'? The plot is hardly worth spelling out in too much detail. I'm not sure I could do it justice anyway. It's the usual overstuffed action-adventure boilerplate about trying to retrieve a mystical MacGuffin — a multilayered orb with the glowing power to destroy worlds — from a sinister baddie (Lee Pace's blue-hued Ronan the Accuser). Actually, if Gunn and co-writer Nicole Perlman had just called the orb a tesseract, you'd basically be re-watching ""The Avengers."" And there's such a mishmash of seemingly interchangeable alien names (Morag, Thanos, Yondu, etc.), it's tempting to tune out, assume it will all make sense in the end, and wait for the next bit of anarchic insult comedy from Pratt & Co. Unlike the sober Norse seriousness of ""Thor"" or the rah-rah retro-squareness of ""Captain America,"" Quill and his posse of merry pranksters are such a delirious blast of laughing gas that ""Guardians"" feels more like an unofficial sequel to 1984's cult hit ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension"" than a Marvel product. (I mean that as a compliment.) A large share of the credit goes to Pratt. On TV's ""Parks and Recreation"" and in such big-screen features as ""Her"" and ""Delivery Man,"" he's always provided a dependable jolt of joy-buzzer surprise in supporting roles. Now he's graduated to leading man — the straw that stirs the drink — and he's such a natural, you can't help but wonder why it took so long. Chris Pratt is the man with 12 percent of a plan in 'Guardians' clip . The other standout is Cooper, who gives the motor-mouthed Rocket an outer-borough wiseguy honk and a hair-trigger temper. He's like an R-rated Daffy Duck with a machine gun. Together, they're a gang of exiles from the planet of misfit toys. Or, as Gamora generously calls them, ''the biggest idiots in the galaxy.'' Will they learn to overcome their selfishness and embrace responsibility for the first time in their lives? Of course they will. The genius of Gunn's superhero send-up is its cheeky, anything-goes absurdity. I've been pretty mixed on Marvel movies over the years — some have dazzled me, others have left me depressed.

"Oklahoma City (CNN) -- Second-grade teacher Tammy Glasgow walks around what's left of Briarwood Elementary, struggling to pick out of its wreckage the things that once made a school. ""This was the cafeteria."" ""This is where my desk sat."" ""This is my classroom door."" ""That yellow wall that's standing, that's where we were,"" said Glasgow, pointing to a squat stack of cinder blocks. She, like many teachers at Oklahoma City's Briarwood, helped keep students safe when a tornado tore through Monday, killing at least 24 people. Incredibly, given the state of the building, everyone at Briarwood survived. Their actions no doubt saved lives. Many have called the teachers -- some of whom literally shielded children with their bodies -- heroes. But that's a word the teachers themselves don't use. ""It's just our job,"" Glasgow said Tuesday. Opinion: The courage of teachers . Right before the tornado hit, she hurried students into two bathrooms and a closet. There were about eights boys in the boys' bathroom, including Glasgow's son, and a dozen girls in the girls' bathroom. She and other adults were with three children in the closet. ""Before I shut the doors, because both bathrooms had doors, I said, 'I'm going to shut these doors,' and I said, 'I love you.' The boys looked at me a little strange. (I) walked in the girls' (bathroom) and said, 'I love you' and they all said 'I love you' back. ""I just told them to pray, and then that's what we did the whole time in the closet, just prayed,"" said Glasgow. The storm blasted through. Stuff flew everywhere. A cinder block fell on her neck. ""I just kept saying to the little girl next to me -- 'It's almost over. It's almost over. It's almost over.' And it just wasn't over,"" she said. Eventually though, rain started to fall and the sky lightened. Glasgow heard voices and so she and others started opening doors and pulling kids out. The children were remarkably calm. When asked to explain why that was, Glasgow said she thought they felt safe. ""We did our best to take care of them and make them feel loved and secure. People talked about us being brave, but it's just our job. We love these kids like they're our own."" Inside a tornado-ravaged school . 'It was a miracle' While Glasgow was hunkered down in the closet, Waynel Mayes, a first-grade teacher, distracted her students with songs and games. ""I just got all the desks and I told the kids that we were going to play worms,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""I told them to get underneath the desks, and I put them two by two, and I said, OK, we're going to play our musical instruments, and we're going to play worms, and we're going to play as loud as we can."" She didn't want the children to know what was going to happen. She didn't want them to hear the roar of the storm.

Afterward, Mayes was sitting outside on a curb with one of her students when his mom walked up. She was crying and hugged her son with her whole body, happy to finally have him in her arms.

The roof and walls collapsed around them. ""Amazingly, by the grace of god, I kept it together,"" she said. ""I couldn't go into hysterics in front of my children, in front of the other students. I had to be calm for them."" ""It's nothing anybody wouldn't do,"" Haley said. ""These children -- we see their smiles, their tears, every day, in and out, and we love them."" Another Briarwood teacher, Cindy Lowe, instructed students to move to an inner part of a room where there was a built-in bookcase as the tornado approached. They crouched in the fetal position and used books to protect their heads, according to Lowe's husband. Among the kids she was watching was their son. ""She sort of got over my son, got over the other children, just sort of was trying to shield anyone she could,"" Chad Lowe told CNN. ""A cinder block wall actually fell on her back, and she kind of lifted herself up,"" he said. After the storm passed, another teacher came to help the kids get out from under the wall and help Cindy Lowe, too. Lowe suffered a concussion and has a bad sprain on her ankle and lots of bruises, her husband said, but is expected to be OK. Their son and the other children all survived. ""His teacher saved his life,"" a mother gushed to CNN affiliate KFOR. ""I have no doubt that God and his teacher, I mean, they lifted a wall off of these kids."" Survivors tell harrowing stories .

"(CNN) -- The federal government may require automakers to road test cars to ensure the accuracy of gas mileage claims, the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Tuesday. Currently, the EPA road tests 10 to 15 percent of new vehicles every year, but the other 85% are tested by the car companies themselves, typically through use of computer modeling, wind tunnels and treadmill-like tests. But those methods have come under scrutiny. Korea's Hyundai and Kia lowered fuel economy estimates for some 2012 and 2013 models after the EPA found discrepancies between agency results and data submitted by the company. Mileage claims were lowered by 1 or 2 miles per gallon on most cars, but the Kia Soul was adjusted by 6 miles per gallon. And Ford last month agreed to make a ""goodwill payment"" to owners of 2013- and 2014-model year hybrid vehicles and most 2014 Fiestas after the EPA challenged its mileage claims. The answer, the EPA says, is to require car makers to conduct road tests. ""Some automakers already do this, but we are establishing a regulatory requirement for all auto makers,"" Chris Grundler, director of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality, told the Wall Street Journal. The proposal has not been formalized, and would have to go through a lengthy public comment and review period. ""At this early stage, it is premature for us to speculate on what form a proposal may take,"" the agency said in a statement Tuesday. ""EPA will engage interested stakeholders proactively before making any proposal."" The EPA said the wind tunnel and other tests are important to get repeatable, reliable data. But it said it is considering requiring road tests. The Obama administration has pushed through significant changes in auto mileage requirements for passenger cars and light trucks, including SUVs, pickups and minivans, as a way to reduce U.S. oil consumption. Related policies and consumer demand with gas prices going up have led to design changes, lighter vehicles, cleaner-burning engines and more gas-electric hybrid vehicles. Cars that go further on a gallon of gas are also a big selling point with consumers looking to save money at the pump.","The EPA has challenged some car companies on their gas mileage claims .

"(CNN) -- African football's ruling body, the Confederation of African Football, has called for a thorough investigation into how 15 fans died at a league match in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The fatalities occurred after a stampede broke out in the closing stages of Sunday's decisive meeting between the country's biggest clubs, AS Vita Club and TP Mazembe. Reports state that trouble flared after fans of home side Vita started throwing missiles onto the pitch with their team trailing 1-0 in a game where the victor would take the title. The police responded by firing tear gas whereupon a stampede for the exit gates led to chaotic scenes of overcrowding, resulting in the deaths and injuries to over 20 others. On its website, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) said the stampede 'caused the collapse of a wall and a gate of the Tata Raphael stadium'. The match was taking place in the Congolese capital Kinshasa, at the stadium that staged the legendary 'Rumble in the Jungle' boxing bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in 1974. ""I wish to reemphasize that any acts of violence have no place in football,"" CAF President Issa Hayatou told cafonline.com. ""They must be condemned in the strongest possible terms and I urge FECOFA (the Congolese FA) and authorities in DR Congo to thoroughly investigate this matter and ensure that measures (are) put in place to avoid a repeat of any incidents."" The long-serving Cameroonian also demanded that CAF be kept abreast of any proposed security measures. Kinshasa governor Andre Kimbuta has already set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the disaster. ""On behalf of FIFA and in my own name, I offer you, and the Congolese FA, my sincerest condolences,"" wrote FIFA President Sepp Blatter in a letter to the President of FECOFA. ""I would be most grateful if you would pass on the deep sympathy and support of the entire international football community to the families, loved ones and clubs of the deceased and victims at this very difficult time."" ""May this message soften their pain and bring them support and comfort."" At FIFA's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich, the flags of both DR Congo and CAF were flown at half-mast in a sign of mourning. The disaster is the worst at a Congolese football match since a game in Butembo in 2008, when 13 spectators -- many of whom were children -- died after police fired tear gas into the crowd shortly after stones had been thrown by the fans. Six years on, a similar set of circumstances has sparked a further devastating loss of life. The two teams are set to meet again on the weekend of May 24-25 in the group stages of the African Champions League. CAF is considering whether to play the match between AS Vita, crowned African champions in the 1970s, and four-time continental winners Mazembe behind closed doors. Mazembe stunned the footballing world in 2010 when becoming the first African side to reach the final of FIFA's Club World Cup, but their name may now conjure up far sadder emotions.","African football body CAF calls for 'thorough' investigation into DR Congo stadium disaster .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than one-third of all weapons the United States has procured for Afghanistan's government are missing, according to a government report released Thursday. U.S.-issue M249 squad automatic weapons are shown at a camp in Kandahar in December. The U.S. military failed to ""maintain complete inventory records for an estimated 87,000 weapons -- or about 36 percent -- of the 242,000 weapons that the United States procured and shipped to Afghanistan from December 2004 through June 2008,"" a U.S. Government Accountability Office report states. ""Accountability lapses occurred throughout the supply chain,"" it says. The Defense Department spent roughly $120 million during that period to acquire a range of small arms and light weapons for the Afghan National Security Forces, including rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. The military also failed to properly account for an additional 135,000 weapons it obtained for the Afghan forces from 21 other countries. ""What if we had to tell families [of U.S. soldiers] not only why we are in Afghanistan but why their son or daughter died at the hands of an insurgent using a weapon purchased by the United States taxpayers? But that's what we risk if we were to have tens of thousands of weapons we provided washing around Afghanistan, off the books,"" Rep. John Tierney, D-Massachusetts, chairman of the House Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs, said at the start of a congressional hearing on the report. The military is unable to provide serial numbers for 46,000 of the missing 87,000 weapons, the report concludes. No records have been maintained for the location or disposition for the other 41,000 weapons. The report urges Defense Secretary Robert Gates to ""establish clear accountability procedures for weapons while they are in the control and custody of the United States"" and direct those ""involved in providing these weapons to track (them) by serial number and conduct routine physical inventories."" The GAO review comes as numerous senior officials -- including President Obama -- are expressing serious concern over the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan. On Wednesday, eight Taliban suicide attackers struck Afghan government buildings and a prison in Kabul, killing at least 19 people in a coordinated attack that the Taliban said was in retaliation for the mistreatment of prisoners, according to Afghan officials. The attacks raised new questions over the effectiveness of the ongoing $16.5 billion U.S. effort to train and equip Afghan security forces. Officials from the State and Defense departments intend to request an additional $5.7 billion in assistance for the Afghan army and police in fiscal year 2009, according to the report. The Obama administration is conducting a top-to-bottom review of U.S. policy toward both Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan. The president will likely make a decision on sending additional troops to Afghanistan ""in the course of the next few days,"" Gates said Tuesday.","87,000 U.S. weapons bought for Afghan government unaccounted for, report says .

"(CNN) -- South Korea's Asiana Airlines admitted Tuesday that pilot error was partly to blame for the crash of Asiana Flight 214 in San Francisco last July, in which three people were killed. Lee Hyomin, a spokeswoman for Asiana Airlines, said the pilot was not solely responsible for the crash but ""could have failed to respond quickly"" to factors including problems with the aircraft's auto throttle system. The auto throttle problem was compounded by inadequate warning systems to alert the flight crew when the plane's airspeed fell too low, she said. The spokeswoman also cited the ""flight crew's failure to execute a timely go-around when the conditions required it by the company's procedures."" Another contributing factor was ""air traffic control instructions and procedures that led to an excessive pilot workload during a high-energy final approach,"" she said. As well as the three who died, scores of passengers were injured when the Boeing 777 struck the seawall at San Francisco International Airport and tumbled down the runway. In January, Asiana filed a lawsuit against Boeing alleging that some equipment on the plane was improperly installed or defective, resulting in inadequate warnings for the pilots about low airspeed. U.S. investigators have also looked at what part an airport navigation system that was out of service while runway improvements were made may have played in the crash. Flight 214's pilot, Capt. Lee Kang Kuk, told the National Transportation Safety Board last year that he found it ""very stressful, very difficult"" to land without the glideslope indicator that helps pilots determine whether the plane is too high or too low during approach. In February, the U.S. Department of Transportation fined Asiana Airlines $500,000 for failing properly to assist families affected by the crash.

"(CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner dampened prospects for emergency action by Congress addressing the immigration crisis on the southern border before lawmakers break for their August recess. ""I don't have as much optimism as I'd like to have,"" Boehner told reporters on Thursday. The Obama administration has warned that some federal agencies dealing with the surge of minors crossing the border, many of them unaccompanied, will run out of money sometime in August. The House and Senate will return after Labor Day. The major sticking point is whether Congress should change a 2008 law requiring that child migrants from Central America receive a hearing before any decision is made to deport them. Critics say the Bush-era law has made the United States a magnet for children fleeing Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. They argue there should be an accelerated process to deport them, just like there is for children who enter the country illegally from Mexico or Canada. Sen. John Cornyn and Democratic Rep Henry Cuellar, both of Texas, have introduced a bipartisan bill to modify the 2008 law and some version of their plan is expected to be attached to any House GOP package that includes emergency funding for border efforts. But top Senate and House Democrats, and virtually all Hispanic lawmakers, are balking at the change. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who recently said she was open to accepting a change now opposes tying that to new funding. Pelosi told reporters Thursday that any debate to reverse the law should be done separately, as part of comprehensive immigration reform. President Barack Obama has proposed $3.7 billion in emergency funding to address the matter. He also does not advocate changing the 2008 law. Boehner insisted, however, that that the law in question must be addressed. ""I don't know how Congress can send more money to the border to begin to mitigate the problem if don't do something about the '08 law that's being abused, and it is being abused,"" he said. House GOP aides say Republicans are working on a package smaller than the one proposed by Obama with some policy changes. They expect to vote on it before the end of July. Boehner's office said it has been involved in some bipartisan negotiations addressing the 2008 law. Referencing her own shift in position, Pelosi said she never likes ""to draw a line in the sand,"" noting that she was open ""to seeing what's there"" two weeks ago. But now ""what we've seen so far is going in the wrong direction and if they want Democratic votes it's got to go in the right direction,"" Pelosi said. In the House, Boehner will need some Democratic support to pass a bill because there is a contingent of House conservatives who don't want to approve any more money for Obama administration's efforts. If Pelosi and other top Democratic leaders stand firm, and Hispanic and progressive lawmakers vote no on a GOP package it could complicate getting something out of the House. Immigration crisis is a political conundrum . Over to the Senate . According to senior Senate Democratic sources, the caucus is fairly evenly divided between those who can accept proposed changes to the 2008 law in order to help speed passage of the funding and those who are unwilling to alter a law that was designed to provide due process to children who may be victims of crimes related to human trafficking. Another wrinkle in the push to finalize a deal is a proposal from conservative Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz introduced legislation to prevent Obama from granting deportation deferments in the future. Obama signed an executive order two years ago allowing many young people who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children to stay. Cruz said such acts of ""amnesty"" are deepening the current crisis by creating the impression that the children coming across the border now will eventually be allowed to stay. Cruz told reporters the focus of his bill is solving the problem. ""What is causing this humanitarian crisis is that these children believe they will be granted in the future amnesty. So this legislation directly addresses that problem by prohibiting the President from granting amnesty from this day forward,"" Cruz said. Boehner sidestepped a question about Cruz's proposal saying there are lots of discussions going on about how to address the border crisis. Cornyn seemed to embrace the idea, although he told reporters he needed time to think through the ramifications. Asked about Boehner's pessimism about getting a deal done this month, Cornyn worried about the situation worsening because of the impasse in Washington. ""What happens if nothing happens is that the problem continues and continues to escalate. We're already seeing backlash from communities all over the country where these children are being placed and people are starting to realize they need to educate, house and raise these children,"" he said. ""I think there will be more negative reaction directed at the President and Congress if we don't act,"" he said. Immigrants or refugees? A difference with political consequences .

"(CNN) -- Strong storms and heavy rain hampered travel from North Carolina to Maine on Tuesday. It was difficult to find an on-time flight out of the Northeast as some major airports had arrival delays of more than four hours. At one point, LaGuardia Airport had a delay of almost five hours. The fight tracking website FlightAware.com said more than 4,600 flights originating in or flying to the United States had been delayed for various reasons, including weather. There were more than 1,200 cancellations. The National Weather's Storm Prediction Center told the millions of Americans along the East Coast to expect storms capable of producing damaging wind gusts. The bad weather wasn't just there. Forecasters said tornadoes were possible in Colorado and Wyoming. There were also flash flood warnings in at least 10 states as storms passed through. In Voorhees, New Jersey, one resident said it felt like a tornado had hit. ""There was lightning striking all around us. Everywhere,"" Sarah Lindauer told CNN affiliate KYW. At least 10 homes in the South Jersey town were damaged, but there were no immediate reports of injury and the weather service blamed the destruction on a severe thunderstorm, not a tornado. Melissa Calkins, an iReporter from Bergen, New Jersey, said it only rained for a few minutes, but when it did, the sky really opened up. She was out walking dogs when the storm hit. She got them in the car and headed to their owner in West New York, New Jersey, about four miles from where she was. ""I was shocked to reach higher ground and still reach a flooded path,"" she said.

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- It's a common sight in the traffic-clogged streets of Istanbul, a city that straddles two continents. Workers next to the spot where subway trains will one day emerge from the tunnel. Opening of the tunnel has been delayed by at least four years by the discovery. A taxi driver, enraged by perpetually gridlocked traffic, stepping out of his car and yelling ""Maniac!"" at the man driving the public bus behind him. For decades Istanbul has been growing at a breakneck speed; its population exceeding -- by some estimates -- 15 million people. Too bad traffic often moves at a snail's pace. Most residents are quick to tell visitors the city's transport system is overwhelmed. ""Istanbul is a dynamically changing city, every year increasing in population,"" says Zeynep Buket, an engineer working with Turkey's transportation ministry. ""We are in need of radical systems, and this radical system is a mass transit system."" The ""radical system"" city planners embarked on five years ago involved construction of a new subway tunnel beneath the Bosphorus Strait, the spectacular body of water that cuts this city in two. By the year 2025, engineers predict more than one million people a day will use the tunnel to travel between Istanbul's Asian and European shores. ""We will connect two continents, Asia and Europe,"" said Nusret Ilbay, one of the many engineers working on the $3 billion Marmaray Tunnel Project. He was standing on scaffolding, overlooking a gaping 30-meter deep hole that will one day be a subway station on the Asian side of the Bosphorus. A concrete wall is all that holds back a churning river of sea water. Watch video of the tunnel being constructed . ""As you can see, some leakage on the wall face has been observed,"" Ilbay explained on a tour of the construction site. ""In order to overcome these leakages, we have applied chemical grouting."" Legend has it, thousands of years ago Jason and the Argonauts narrowly escaped death sailing up the Bosphorus in search of the mythological Golden Fleece. Today, engineers face equally daunting challenges building a tunnel beneath one of the world's busiest shipping channels, at depths of up to 55 meters, in an active earthquake zone. First they dredged a trench on the bottom of the Bosphorus. Then, using divers and undersea cameras, they submerged and buried 11 massive pre-fabricated tunnel segments, almost all of them longer than a football field. To enter the unfinished tunnel, visitors must climb down a steep staircase in a construction tower surrounded by water in the middle of the strait. During the descent, the temperature plummets and humidity rises. Construction workers toil here in the gloom of this 1.4 kilometer long tube on the bottom of the sea, their welding torches spraying showers of sparks in the darkness. One worker claimed that during the lunch break, when the machinery came to a stop, he could hear the sound of oil tanker and cargo ships' engines as they motored past in the waters overhead. As a precaution in the event of a catastrophic flood in the tunnel, engineers constructed an emergency bunker on the bottom of the sea. Stocked with food and water and equipped with a heavy water-proof door, the ""emergency room"" is supposed to protect survivors for up to 10 days, until they can be rescued. But, in their rush to modernize Istanbul's transport system, city planners ran into an unforeseen obstacle: history. In Yenikapi, a neighborhood of textile factories and seedy hotels where one of the main transit stations for Istanbul's new subway and commuter rail system was to be built, archaeologists discovered the lost Byzantine port of Theodosius. It was originally built at the end of the 4th century AD by Emperor Theodosius I  when Istanbul -- then known as Constantinople -- was the capital of the eastern Roman Empire. The port's harbor silted over centuries ago, and eventually disappeared beneath subsequent layers of civilization. Until its rediscovery in 2004, archaeologists said they only knew about the port from ancient books. ""This was a big moment of joy and happiness for us, an unexplainable feeling,"" recalls Professor Zeynep Kiziltan, the acting director of Istanbul's Archaeology Museum.  Look at pictures of the excavation » . ""At around one meter below sea level, we started finding the remains of ropes. As we continued [digging] a bit more, the remains of a boat surfaced."" Since that discovery, armies of hundreds of laborers and archaeologists have been working in a giant pit, three shifts a day, seven days a week. The scale of the excavation is unusual in modern-day archaeology, says Cemal Pulak, an anthropologist from Texas A&M University's nautical archaeology program. Look at a map of the site . ""Its mind-boggling ... it really looks like an Indiana Jones-type operation,"" says Pulak, who has worked as a consultant on the excavation of the lost port. The Yenikapi dig has uncovered an ancient armada: 34 Byzantine ships ranging from dating between the 7th and 11th centuries AD. In one tent, two workers carefully uncover the ancient wooden beams of a 40-meter long merchant vessel. A third man preserves the wood by keeping it moist, sprinkling the relics with water from a hose. Archaeologists have nicknamed this ship ""The Titanic,"" because it is the largest of the Theodosius wrecks. It is believed the vessel once carried wheat from Egypt to Constantinople. Scattered around the ship are shards of pottery, animal bones, and thousand-year-old clamshells. Historians say the new discoveries include the first examples of ships being built using the beginnings of the ""skeleton approach"" to constructing the vessel's hull. Pulak says that marked a revolutionary change which transformed shipbuilding from ""mostly an art form to a science."" ""The earlier methods of building depended on verbal transference of the method from master shipbuilders to apprentices,"" he explained. ""The development of the latter method ... allowed for the speedy communication of new shipbuilding ideas that could be transmitted on paper. It is the beginning of engineering. Ships could be preconceived and pre-designed."" ""I think it is one of the unique projects not only for us but for the world,"" said geologist Yucel Yilmaz. In addition to finding the timbers of thousand-year-old jetties and docks, which still jut up in straight rows at the bottom of the mammoth pit, archaeologists have uncovered the remnants of a pre-historic human settlement. ""The first man, about 8,400 years ago, came and started to settle here,"" Yilmaz said. ""There was no Bosphorus [then]. The Bosphorus was a river valley... the people who settled here walked across the Bosphorus."" Plans to travel beneath the Bosphorus have been delayed at least four years by the excavation of the Theodosious Port. The postponement has added untold millions of dollars have also been added to the cost of the entire project. In the rush to move forward, the residents of Istanbul have accidentally uncovered a valuable piece of their city's ancient past.","A 1.4 km long subway tunnel is being constructed under Istanbul's Bosphorus Strait .

"(CNN) -- Bel Kaufman, author of the bestselling 1960s classic ""Up the Down Staircase,"" has died at 103. Kaufman's digital publisher Open Road Media said the writer died on Friday.

Born in Germany and raised in Russia, Kaufman came to the United States with her family when she was 12.

"(CNN) -- Watching CNN's town hall with Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, I found the former secretary of state, senator, first lady and potential 2016 presidential candidate thoroughly enjoyable and at times even captivating and compelling. I sincerely appreciated the passion and clarity with which she addressed topics such as gun control (""A minority of people hold a viewpoint that terrorizes the majority of people""), marriage equality (""I'm very, very proud to state that I'm a full supporter of marriage equality right now"") and voting rights (""I deplore the efforts by some to restrict the right to vote""). And she was downright funny when she joked that she hadn't smoked pot yet and wasn't about to start anytime soon. But otherwise, as in most of her time in the public eye in general, Clinton was predictable and plain and, I'm sorry to say, kind of boring. Her answer on what to do about the millions of families who continue to be ripped apart by deportation was noncommittal. Clinton said that if Congress still continues to fail to pass comprehensive immigration reform, she would support ""more leeway and more discretion for the executive branch."" But Congress isn't passing reform any time soon, so real leadership on this issue now requires a more concrete -- and bold -- response. And then Clinton went on to mirror Republican talking points about border security and the need to ""send a clear"" message to would-be migrants, including children who ""should be sent back."" Clinton was carefully trying to echo immigrant-rights sentiments while toeing a conservative line on policy -- the opposite of bold leadership. When the question of Benghazi came up, Clinton carefully defended herself to such an extent that she almost seemed to be reading a script. What she didn't do was use the opportunity to go after those who continue to politicize Benghazi to try to damage her potential candidacy. In fact, she even gave their ongoing concerns credence in suggesting she still has questions about what happened that night -- this despite dozens of hearings and briefings and millions of taxpayer dollars wasted in political fishing expeditions. Again, Clinton walked the safe and predictable line here but definitely not one interesting to voters looking for decisive closure on Benghazi, or for those of us in the chattering class. I confess I already have a chip on my shoulder about the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency. She is far too centrist on economic issues and hawkish on foreign policy, not only for my personal taste but arguably for the majority of American voters today. At a time when most Americans still want Wall Street held accountable for crashing our economy, President Hillary Clinton would likely be cozier with big banks than Barack Obama has been. And at a time when the majority of Americans are strongly regretful about the Iraq War -- and are deeply wary of another one -- it's worth remembering that Clinton voted for the war, even if she did later change her mind. Even as tea party-ish Republicans are thumping the drums of economic populism, Clinton is literally and figuratively the candidate of the establishment. Of course I think Clinton would be better for America than any number of Republican alternatives. I'll take pro-corporate, mushy centrism over pro-corporate, right-wing extremism any day. But that doesn't mean I'm excited. When it comes to economic and social policy, Clinton is no passionate, populist progressive. Fine, so at the very least I'd like to be wowed by rhetoric. That's what Obama did. I didn't like his centrist record and policy agenda either, but I'll admit I was dazzled by the way he wrapped his mushy Democratic status quo-ness in lofty ideals and imagery. For us progressives, national elections generally require settling for the lesser of two evils. At least Obama made us rhetorically feel we were voting for something different. We hoped for change, even if we deep down knew we wouldn't get it. In what was presumably a dig at Obama, Clinton said during the CNN town hall, ""Some people can paint a beautiful vision. And, thankfully, we can all learn from that, but then, can you -- with the tenacity, the persistence, the getting-knocked-down/getting-back-up resilience -- can you lead us there?"" The implication is that she is no beautiful vision painter, she's the get-er-done-er -- batting cleanup on the unfinished business of Obama and to an extent Bill Clinton as well. And while I genuinely suspect that with her longer exposure to the slings and arrows of right-wing political attacks and both the thicker skin and bare-knuckle tactics she has developed in response, Hillary Clinton might indeed be able to get more done than Obama, even when faced with the same utterly unfathomable and childish Republican intransigence, I just can't get excited. But at the end of the day, that lack of excitement may be Clinton's best asset if she chooses to run. After all, we live in a 24/7 scandal cycle where political candidates flame out with one misstep of a tweet. (And some would agree with Jessica Valenti that Clinton has no choice but to be boring, given that ""any emotion that Hillary Clinton shows has always been used against her, and it has become a kind of stand-in for the many reasons women are said to be oh-so-unfit to lead."") Opinion: What Clinton doesn't get on immigration . The downside to Clinton being so careful and calculated is also an upside; she's not likely to make any serious mistakes anytime soon. And while political leaders who make bullheaded (and factually misleading) arguments that lead our country to war or those who stand firmly and consistently on the other side are certainly more exciting, we need more leaders who are willing to see both sides of an argument and occasionally admit when they're wrong -- as Clinton did on Iraq. Not exciting but refreshing and important. And certainly, given the inability of Republicans to identify a front-runner at this point, let alone their track record of producing an astonishing rate of disqualifying gaffes, simply by not rocking the boat, Clinton may sail into the White House. Inevitability is boring, but who cares if it works? What was exciting about the CNN town hall was the format, the superb moderating by Christiane Amanpour, the probing questions from the diverse audience, the online interaction via Tumblr and the opportunity for ordinary Americans directly to engage a historic figure on live, national television.

"(CNN) -- I was 17 when my mother died of breast cancer. She was 42. It seemed old to me then. As a middle-aged mother myself now, I see it differently. Forty-two was impossibly young. I've spent more than half my life without my mother. Does it sound odd to hear that I still miss her, even after 33 years? I used to think that feeling sad two years, five years, even 10 years after her death meant I'd somehow grieved wrong. But now I know differently. Mourning is a lifelong process, especially for children who lose a mother young. When a child loses a mother, maturity often follows quickly. ""Normal"" is irrevocably redefined. Over the years, milestones that bring joy to others may trigger a range of mixed emotions in the motherless. Graduations, weddings, childbirth, new jobs: These are all times of transition when we long for a mother's support, encouragement or celebration. But when we look over our shoulders for reassurance, a mother isn't there. This can lead to a new mourning cycle, where the pain feels fresh and raw. It explains why, upon the birth of my first child, I was relieved to have a healthy child, overjoyed to have a daughter; and also terribly, terribly sad, because my mother would never meet her. Some transitions are one-time events, like reaching a mother's age at time of death. This is a profound turning point for a motherless woman, who often carries the fear that she'll die at the same age. Forty-two was an emotionally charged year for me, but 43 was even stranger. I'm now seven years older than my mother got to be. How does an adult daughter even begin to make sense of that? In the 20 years since the publication of ""Motherless Daughters"" I've met thousands of motherless women, all around the globe. Many of them have found mother substitutes in grandmothers, aunts, sisters or good friends. That was never true for me. My greatest source of comfort has come from other women like myself. We ""get"" each other, right away. We cry in the back of school concerts because we're equally proud and sad. We raise our children to be independent just in case we, too, die young. And we understand, whether we're mothers or not, how Mother's Day weekend can be a double-edged sword. Motherless women -- as well as daughters who have estranged or difficult relationships with their mothers -- really have no culturally sanctioned way to recognize their mothers on Mother's Day. So we're free to create our own. Here are some ideas from two decades of interviews with motherless women and 33 years of spending Mother's Day without my own: . Attend a local Motherless Daughters Day luncheon. More than two dozen groups of women throughout the country, from Orange County, California, to Chicago to New Orleans plan luncheons on the day before Mother's Day (or soon after) to honor mothers no longer living. During a Circle of Remembrance women say their names and their mothers' names out loud. Make your mother part of the day. If she liked to cook, make one of her recipes. Put her picture on your mantel. Tell your children or nieces and nephews a story about her. Recognizing her will feel better than trying to push the memory away. If you have a strained or nonexistent relationship with your mother, use the day to celebrate life instead, in honor of the life she gave you. Get your hands into the earth and plant seedlings. Volunteer at an animal shelter. Do what nurtures and inspires you most. This year marks the 100th anniversary of Mother's Day as an official, national holiday. Let's remember, too, Anna Jarvis, the woman responsible for lobbying President Wilson to create the national holiday -- and herself a motherless daughter. I'll be celebrating the same as usual: having brunch with my husband and daughters, enjoying a low-key afternoon at home and searching for a way to honor my mother, as I've done every Mother's Day since 1982, the first I spent without her.","Hope Edelman's mother died when she was 17.

"Oxford, UK (CNN) -- If you ever try your hand at farming spiders, you'll very soon discover it's no easy task. Penning in a bunch of golden orb weavers -- the queens of the web-spinning world -- will earn you only a few milligrams of ultra-tough spider's silk. That's if they don't eat each other first, explains Dr. Nick Skaer. And they will. Bug catcher . As a boy, Dr Skaer loved hunting for creepy crawlies -- but was never a fan of spiders. Today, Skaer's day-job involves persuading people to implant the creatures' silky secretions under their skin -- with the promise that the fiber will weave together damaged tissue. It's a ""quantum leap,"" admits Dr Skaer, but his creation could one day relieve agony for millions. Watch the video above to see how the Dr Skaer created the FibroFix implant. Thread of life . Skaer, now the CEO of biomaterials producers Orthox explains that silk produced by spiders is not just naturally tough -- 25 times the strength of steel -- it is also ""biocompatible."" The close similarity between molecules in the spider silk and proteins in the human body means human cells can grow into the fiber. When implanted in the human body, a device made from spiders silk would encourage the surrounding cells to ""repopulate the device with actual human living tissue,"" Skaer says. ""If you've got a very strong, resilient material which also has a lot of similarities to tissues in the human body, it's a great place to start for trying to make a medical implant."" Watch: 'The night I invented 3D printing' Saved by the silkworm . Instead of fighting the spider's cannibal instinct, and meager rate of production, Skaer's team set about creating fake spider's silk -- made from the same fibers that go into high class scarves. The team took silkworms, which produce 1000 times as much silk as a spider, and broke it down to the basic molecules. Re-spinning this so that all the proteins are closely aligned -- just how a spider does -- creates a far stronger fiber than the silkworm can. Or -- when Skaer presents their finished product -- a rubber-looking crescent-shaped implant. Friends in knees . The FibroFix implant is soon destined for knee joints, where Skaer believes it can help people with damaged cartilage to regrow the shock-absorbing tissue. Without this implant, millions of people have no option but to resort to total knee replacement surgery. As of 2010, over 600,000 total knee replacements are performed annually in the United States alone, and estimates suggest that this figure will increase 6-fold by 2030. This marks a $13 billion-per-year cost for Americans, which is set to rise as the ageing Baby Boomer generation battle age-related conditions such as osteoarthritis, but demand to stay active. The first round of trialists are set to start receiving FibroFix implants this year, and Skaer hopes they will pave the way for others to avoid knee replacement: . ""If the clinical trials go well, we hope to have this available for patients within the next two to three years."" Beyond the knee . Skaer sees future applications in other joints -- ""the hip, the shoulder, ankle, all of these suffer osteoarthritis"" -- as well as in the cartilage discs between the bones in the spine. It doesn't stop there, either: . ""If you've got a technology that integrates very well with the body -- which allows cells to grow down into it -- then bones and joints certainly aren't the only tissues in the body that you could look to address."" In the long term, Skaer imagines silk platforms being used to patch up intestines, hernias, and muscles -- including in the heart. There's even the suggestion that -- one day -- it could fix a severed spine: . ""Is there the potential for nerve repair? Well, the chaps [research scientists] at Oxford University have certainly started looking at nerve repair as an interesting further application of this technology. And they've got some promising early results certainly."" ""That obviously is far, far earlier than the stage that we're at..."" Watch: The technology bringing Sinatra, Tupac back to life . Spider thread revisited . For now, relieving the agony of knee pain is motivation enough. And all this has given him a new perspective on the crawling spider: . ""Spiders I suppose are very different from when I was turning over rocks and looking underneath them and when I was a kid. ""I don't so much see the eight legs crawling around and the sharp pair of fangs -- I see something that can spin me a remarkable material, and that's very exciting, as a scientist.""","Is this knee implant really made from spider's silk?

It could help thousands of people to avoid knee replacement surgery .
Eventually, the material could help repairall varieties of human tissue -- including nerves ."
"(CNN) -- A class action lawsuit that accused ABC and the firms that produce the dating shows ""The Bachelor"" and ""The Bachelorette"" of intentionally excluding people of color from lead roles has been dismissed. U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger ruled Monday that Nathaniel Claybrooks' and Christopher Johnson's efforts were ""laudable,"" but that casting decisions by the network and series' producers are protected by the First Amendment. ""The First Amendment prevents the plaintiffs from effectuating these goals by forcing the defendants to employ race-neutral criteria in their casting decisions in order to 'showcase' a more progressive message,"" the ruling said. The suit was brought by the two Nashville residents, who are African-American, after they applied to be on ""The Bachelor"" in 2011. Johnson alleged in the complaint that when he went to a casting call for the show, he was denied the typical application process. He said his application materials were taken by an employee of the defendants named in the suit; the same wasn't done for other apparent non-black applicants he saw. Are dating shows behind the curve when it comes to inclusion? Claybrooks alleges that at his casting call for the show he was interviewed for less time than white applicants, rushed through the process, and therefore not given the same opportunity as the white applicants. The complaint also alleges that few people of color are chosen to compete for the affection of the ""Bachelor"" or ""Bachelorette,"" and when there are, they tend to be eliminated early. ABC declined to comment on the suit, while another defendant, Warner Horizon Television, called the complaint ""baseless and without merit"" in a statement to CNN. The production company says it has had ""various participants of color throughout the series' history, and the producers have been consistently -- and publicly -- vocal about seeking diverse candidates for both programs. As always, we continue to seek out participants of color for both 'The Bachelor' and 'The Bachelorette.'"" Catch up with TV show recaps . What's new this fall .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli military said Tuesday it is launching an investigation into a video that surfaced on YouTube that showed what appeared to be an Israeli soldier dancing around a blindfolded and bound Palestinian prisoner. The video is the latest in a number of social media controversies that have engulfed the Israeli military. This summer, a female former Israeli soldier posted photos of herself posing in front of blindfolded Palestinian prisoners. The photos and her subsequent defense of her actions sparked international criticism of the military. Blog: Another dancing soldier? It was not known when the latest video was shot, but it appears to have been posted to the video-sharing website in 2008. The clip, which first aired Monday night on Israel's Channel 10, shows a man dressed in Israeli army fatigues dancing next to a blindfolded woman. In a statement, the Israeli military said it ""denounces actions such as those depicted in the videos, and continues to make every effort to eliminate such behavior through briefings to soldiers, directives to officers, military orders, and punishment when necessary."" The statement also stressed that such incidents are ""isolated cases that do not represent the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) as a whole."" Ghassan Khatib, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority, said the video was ""a disgusting illustration of the sick and hostile mentality of the Israeli soldiers serving as occupiers in the Palestinian territories."" ""It should remind the whole world that it is about time to end this illegal occupation and to allow the Palestinians their basic right of freedom,"" he said. In August, the pictures posted on Facebook by a female former soldier -- identified online as ""Eden from Ashdod"" in Israel -- prompted harsh reactions. In one photo, she is seen smiling and sitting on a blast barrier next to a blindfolded man. In another, she is sitting in front of three blindfolded Palestinians, one with his hands tied in front of him. The photos have since been removed from her Facebook site, but Israeli media reports the photos were labeled ""IDF -- best time of my life.""

"(CNN) -- It was big news in the tech world -- or at least it would have been if it had been true. Google, so the story went, had purchased ICOA, a Wi-Fi provider, for $400 million. Some news organizations pounced, with everyone from long-established outlets like The Associated Press to new-media tech blogs like TechCrunch reporting the news Monday. But hours later, both companies would deny the story, which PR Web, a site that distributes press releases for a fee, says was planted by someone falsely claiming to represent ICOA. Hoaxes have slipped their way into the public eye for as long as journalism has existed. But media experts say the way bad information spread so quickly casts a light on how reporting can go wrong in the fast-paced world of Web journalism. Long gone are the days when newspapers and the evening TV news were the only game in town -- when reporters had hours, if not days, to sift through a report before sharing it with the masses. In their place is an info-hungry Web that wants news now and rewards the quick with a currency of page views, Twitter links and Facebook ""likes."" ""With something like this, there are a lot of blogs and websites that build their reputation on the tech world,"" said Kelly McBride, a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit devoted to the study and teaching of journalism. ""If Google is spending $400 million to buy something, there are people who are expected to have something to say about that and they want to be in that mix."" The Onion: We just fooled the Chinese government! While a rush to get into that mix as quickly as possible probably played a role, McBride said there were multiple breakdowns in the Google-ICOA nonstory. The first, obviously, was the person who -- according to PR Web owners Vocus -- impersonated an ICOA representative. ""Vocus reviews all press releases and follows an internal process designed to maintain the integrity of the releases we send out every day,"" the company said in a written statement. ""Even with reasonable safeguards identity theft occurs, on occasion, across all of the major wire services. We have removed the fraudulent release and turned the matter over to the proper authorities for further investigation."" On Thursday, Vocus CEO Rick Rudman published a letter apologizing for the gaffe and promising that the company had improved it's process. ""It's clear that we have to hold our service to an ever-higher standard, so PRWeb will continue to evolve,"" Rudman wrote. "" We will continue to deliver a service that's valuable to our customers, valuable to our readers and valuable to our distribution and media partners -- and we'll work tirelessly to deliver on these promises."" Financial experts say the hoax looks like an illegal effort to inflate ICOA's meager stock. Shares, which trade for a fraction of a penny, jumped in price dramatically Monday and hundreds of millions of shares changed hands before the stock was frozen. ICOA CEO George Strouthopoulos told Mashable, a CNN content partner, that the release apparently originated in Aruba and was sent from an e-mail account designed to look like an official ICOA address. But the most damning gaffe may have been PR Web's, McBride said. Acquired by Vocus in 2006, PR Web aims to compete with the decades-old PR Newswire and other press-release outlets. ""Their quality-control process in printing out press releases obviously has some problems,"" McBride said. ""It's not just that they got 'hacked' -- but that it was a pretty crappy press release."" The release had several grammatical errors, included no contact information for representatives of Google or ICOA, and didn't include biographical information about the companies that is typical in releases from major corporations. In a post titled ""How PRWeb Helps Distribute Crap Into Google & News Sites,"" Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land searched PR Web and found one of the Internet's ubiquitous ""how to buy cheap Viagra"" posts and other content that would seem more at home in a spam e-mail than on a news site. The final error, McBride said, was on the part of reporters. Whether racing to publish fast or working on analysis of the supposed purchase, news outlets missed what should have been red flags. ""Journalists who were looking at it should have spotted those same weak spots in the press release and questioned whether it was real or not,"" she said. ""Those journalists were relying on PR Web to do that and they shouldn't have. ""It would be easy to conclude that we're all going too fast. But it could be that we placed way too much trust in PR Web ... and assuming it had the same checks and balances and safety nets that other PR wires have."" (Full disclosure: Last year, this reporter, like others at numerous news outlets, was duped by pranksters who created an entire website for a fictional consulting firm to release a phony survey comparing the IQs of users of various Web browsers.) Perhaps helping push the fake ICOA story, McBride said, was the Web's ability to share news stories in real time. ""Once one organization does it, other organizations tend to place even more blind faith,"" she said. ""Once the AP (for example) does it, then everyone does it."" The Associated Press retracted and issued a correction for the story. When contacted, an AP spokeswoman referred CNN to the wire service's retraction, which cited ICOA and ""a person close to Google"" as saying the original report was untrue. TechCrunch apologized to its readers, both owning up to the error and appearing to take a shot at PR Web in the process. ""We were wrong on this post, for not following up with Google and the other company involved but posting rather than ... waiting on a solid confirmation beforehand from either source,"" read an editor's note atop the original post. ""We apologize to our readers, to the companies involved, and we'll be sure to act in a more responsible manner for future stories, rather than trusting the word of a website that doesn't necessarily hold itself up to any journalistic standards."" Forbes and Reuters were among the other news outlets that reported the fake purchase, as were popular tech sites PC Magazine, The Next Web, Business Insider, Engadget, VentureBeat, The Verge and GigaOM. Other outlets, like MSNBC and USA Today, ran the Associated Press account.","Fake news report about Google sheds light on Web news pitfalls .

"(CNN) -- Italian President Giorgi Napolitano warned this week that the country could be on the verge of violent social uprising following more than a week of protests in several cities. This discontent in Italy comes at the same time as Ukraine is witnessing the largest civil unrest since the 2004 Orange Revolution. The protests highlight the significant political instability that has characterized international relations since 2008, as was predicted by some. For instance, in February 2009, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Admiral Dennis Blair asserted that ""the financial crisis and global recession are likely to produce a wave of economic crises."" Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed ""this economic crisis, left unresolved ... will upend governments, [and] it will unfortunately breed instability."" Five years on, these U.S. concerns have been at least partially borne out. However, the political instability that has ensued has had diverse origins, and the degree to which the financial crisis has been a driver has varied from country to country. In the European Union, for instance, millions have taken to the streets and administrations in more than half of the 27 member states fell or were voted out of office from Spring 2010 to 2012 alone. Within the core eurozone, 11 of 14 governments collapsed or were turfed out during that same two years. Even more eye-catching, however, have been the political revolutions and popular uprisings in emerging economies. This includes Ukraine and June's demonstrations in Brazil (the largest in the country for two decades); through to what has been called the ""Arab Spring"" in North Africa and the Middle East, including the civil war in Syria; revolutionary changes of power in Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya; transfer of power in Yemen; plus demonstrations and uprisings in Turkey, Iran, Algeria, Bahrain, Jordan, Morocco and Oman. Despite the diverse nature of this international political instability, from Rio, and Athens, to Cairo, it has reportedly been described as ""a revolutionary wave, like 1848"" by Nigel Inkster, former director of operations for the UK Secret Intelligence Service. Others have compared the situation to 1914, 1968 and 1989. Whatever the validity of these historical analogies, it is clear that the current ""wave"" of volatility has been driven by a broad range of economic, political, social and technological factors. And, these have played out in contrasting ways across the world. In the European Union, for instance, the role of economic downturn and austerity since the 2008 financial crisis has been key, especially in those states most impacted by the Eurozone crisis like Greece and Spain. Unrest, however, has also tapped into pre-existing disquiet with established European political parties and systems. In the Middle East, by contrast, protest has often stemmed primarily from deep-seated political and socio-economic discontent that has existed for many years. Post-2008, however, factors including liquidity crunches, increased food prices, and unemployment spikes, have exacerbated these longer-standing grievances. A key question is whether international political instability will tail off in coming years, especially if economic recovery takes hold in much of the world. While this is possible, protest and uprising is likely to continue in some countries for at least two sets of reasons. Firstly, even if the worst of the financial crisis has now passed, its consequences endure, especially for the increased number of young people who are unemployed. This puts many at risk of long-term damage to their earnings potential and job prospects, fuelling discontent. In the EU, a record 24.4% of people under 25 are unable to find work. This has given rise to concern, including from German Chancellor Angela Merkel about a ""lost generation,"" especially in countries like Greece and Spain where youth unemployment is almost 60%. As in Europe, youth unemployment in numerous Middle Eastern and North African countries is above 50%, and it is estimated that the region's average rate could breach 30% within 5 years. In the Middle East, the problem is acute because it has the world's biggest youth bulge comprised of increasing educated people. Secondly, there are some factors completely unrelated to the post-2008 financial crisis that will endure, if not intensify. This includes the disruptive role of social media. There remains debate about how instrumental social media has been in fomenting political instability in recent years, not least in the Middle East and North Africa. However, whether one sees this new technology as an essential component that translated discontent into concrete action, or accentuated what was already-inevitable, indisputably it has played an enabling role that will likely only grow. Taken as a whole, it is premature to claim, as some have done, that we have entered a new era of global revolution that is here to stay. Indeed, overall political instability may decline if the world economy enters a sustained recovery. However, there remains significant prospect of political volatility, as the current protests in Italy and Ukraine underline. While circumstances will vary from country to country, instability will potentially be fueled not just by legacy of the financial crisis such as higher youth unemployment, but also longer-standing political and socio-economic discontent which social media is giving new impetus. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Hammond.","Political instability has characterized international relations since 2008, writes Andrew Hammond .

"(CNN) -- The figure peers down silently from an upper floor of the ruins of a Scottish castle, wearing what looks like an outfit from the Middle Ages. Could this be a long-dead Scottish earl, or just a random, modern-day visitor? The mysterious image captured by Chris Aitchison at Tantallon Castle in eastern Scotland. The eerie image is captured in a photograph taken by tourist Christopher Aitchison in May 2008 at Tantallon Castle, which sits on a rocky outcrop along the Scottish coast, east of Edinburgh. The ""person"" appears to be wearing an old-style greenish ruff around the neck. Aitchison insists he did not tamper with the image and cannot explain it. ""I was not aware of anyone, or anything, being present in my picture, only noticing the anomaly when I got home,"" Aitchison said. ""Staff have verified that there were no sinister dummies in period costume or historical reenactments going on that day at the castle. I did not notice any nice old ladies wearing ruffs walking around the stairs!"" The picture was made public Friday by Richard Wiseman, a professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire who also studies the paranormal. Wiseman said he was looking for ""photographic evidence for ghosts"" ahead of a session on the subject at the Edinburgh International Science Festival next week.  See gallery of haunted photographs » . Wiseman solicited such photos from around the world and collated them for the conference. He said the majority of images showed mysterious-looking orbs, mists, figures and faces. In one picture, a face appears in the side-view mirror of a parked Mercedes convertible. The photographer insists no one was around when he took the picture; skeptics say the mirror could be reflecting the headrest or be the result of digital manipulation. Another photo of a person walking through a creek in the woods appears to show a second person wearing a hooded sweatshirt, standing on a rock nearby. Skeptics say the ""figure"" is an illusion created by tree branches and the rock formation in the background. Two friends raising a drink to the camera in a third photograph are joined by a ghostly third figure in the background with a face that looks like a Halloween monster mask. ""Many of the photographs can be easily explained,"" said photographer Gordon Rutter, who also examined the pictures. ""Orbs can be caused by the camera flash reflecting off tiny dust particles, mists can result from condensed breath in front of the lens, long exposures can create ghostly figures, and apparent faces are often people seeing patterns in random shapes."" But the ""ghost"" in the Scottish castle has generated the most attention. What do you think about the image? Tantallon Castle was built in the 1350s by a nobleman and soon became the stronghold of the Douglas dynasty. For 300 years, the Douglas earls of Angus held sway at the castle as one of the most powerful families in Scotland, according to Historic Scotland, which looks after historic sites for the Scottish government. The castle also was the scene of violence, enduring three great sieges: in 1491, 1528 and 1651. The last, by Oliver Cromwell's army, resulted in such destruction that the fortress was abandoned. It remains the ""last truly great castle"" built in Scotland, with enormously thick and high stone walls enclosing large courtyards, and high stone towers. That stonework could explain the mysterious figure in the photograph, having caused unusual shadows. It is also possible that a member of the public was standing there when the picture was taken, Wiseman said -- in which case, he hopes they will come forward. ""I think it's probably a person who's been caught in slightly odd dress,"" Wiseman told CNN. ""We know the day it was taken ... so somebody might come forward to say, 'That was me.'"" He added, ""If they can explain it, e-mail me. Or indeed, if they have photos they think are better, e-mail them to me."" A similar mystery happened five years ago at another medieval site, Hampton Court Palace, built by King Henry VIII west of London. A security camera captured a figure in period dress opening a window, peering out, then closing it again. Palace officials insisted at the time that no one was in the room, and they were at a loss to explain the figure. It later emerged that a member of staff wearing a medieval costume was the person in the video.","Photograph taken by Christopher Aitchison in May 2008 at Tantallon Castle .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Garbage dumps are generally not associated with thriving coral reefs, vast mangrove plantations and rare bird species. Yet on Pulau Semakau off Singapore, this is exactly what you will find: just beside a secluded ecological zone that harbors dozens of rare plant, bird and fish species lies the world's first ecological offshore landfill. Located 8 kilometers south of Singapore and covering an area of 3.5 square kilometers, the Semakau Landfill was designed by engineers and environmentalists at Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA). It consists of two small islands that have been connected by a rock embankment. The area inside the landfill is divided into 11 bays, known as 'cells', which are lined with thick plastic and clay to prevent any harmful material from seeping into the sea. Since the landfill was put into use in 1999, four of the 11 cells have been filled, covered with earth and planted with grass. The landfill, which cost around $400 million, can hold up to 63 million cubic meters of rubbish, enough to satisfy Singapore's waste disposal needs until 2040. Clean and odor-free . What distinguishes Semakau from other landfills is that it is clean and free of smell. Two thirds of the material that comes to Semakau has passed through one of the city's four incinerators, reducing it to approximately ten percent of its original volume. Waste from construction material is also processed, while toxic waste like asbestos is packaged in such a way that it cannot leak into the surrounding environment. Two mangrove groves that were destroyed when the embankment was built have been replanted near the landfill and today they serve as biological indicators for the local environment. If they were to start dying, it would be seen as a sign that harmful material had leaked from the landfill. Scientists expected that some of the mangroves would not survive the relocation, but today they cover 1.4 square kilometers around the island and even have to be cut back in places -- a sign that the landfill is indeed leak-proof. Flourishing wildlife . Together with the island's other ecosystems such as seagrass meadows, coral reefs and sandy shores, the mangroves serve as a habitat for a variety of birds, fish and plants. The decision to build a landfill off Semakau was taken in the 1990's when the previous landfill on the main island had nearly reached capacity. ""As land is scarce in Singapore, it was decided from the outset that the new sanitary landfill in the smaller islands would be designed as an environmentally friendly facility which would be used to meet Singapore's land use needs when it was eventually filled up and closed,"" the NEA explained in an official statement. Every effort was made to minimize the impact on the local environment so that the area beside the landfill, which always had a rich flora and fauna, has remained intact. ""Great effort went into making sure that the impact of the landfill on Pulau Semakau's biodiversity was minimized. In fact, biodiversity remains high and we have not lost a single species because of the landfill,"" says Wang Luan Keng, an education and research officer at the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (RMBR) in Singapore. New species . She adds that as the island's various ecosystems continue to flourish, scientists are still discovering new species on Semakau. In July 2005, the government decided to open the western part of Semakau up to the public for recreational purposes. Today there are guided nature walks along the island's coast, while sports fishing and bird watching associations also organize special excursions to the island. ""When we do the tours around the island, we have a powerful message,"" says Ria Tan, an associate at the RMBR and owner of a popular Web site, wildsingapore.com. ""We tell people: 'Look how beautiful this is, and imagine what could be destroyed if the landfill had to be expanded.' This makes them think and when they go home they are more careful about how they deal with waste."" Rich biodiversity . Thus, the Semakau Landfill project has inadvertently turned into more than just a trash dump; it is becoming an educational project and could serve as a model for sustainable urban development around the world. ""The rich biodiversity around the sanitary landfill shows that development and environmental protection can co-exist and need not be mutually exclusive,"" says the NEA. ""It is of course a compromise, but in the context of urban living I think it is a good one. Some nature lovers criticize the project, but in the end we have to throw our rubbish somewhere and this is a good solution,"" says Tan. Wang agrees. ""I see Semakau Landfill as a great way of striking a balance between the need of urban development and nature conservation."" .................................

"(CNN) -- One of John Athanson's earliest memories is seeing mermaids at Weeki Wachee Springs, the ""City of Live Mermaids."" Today, the 47-year-old is the public relations manager for Weeki Wachee Springs State Park, and has been for 10 years. The park north of Tampa, Florida, hosts shows year-round involving women dressed as mermaids. It bills itself as ""a magical entrance into a mysterious blue underwater world of mermaids, manatees, turtles and bubbles."" ""If you ask me, (mermaids) do exist,"" Athanson said Thursday. ""They exist, and they exist right here in Weeki Wachee."" Photos: Anniversary of the bikini . He was responding to the U.S. government's fresh announcement to the contrary. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has published an unexpected statement to its website explaining that there is no evidence the legendary ""half-human, half-fish sirens of the sea"" have ever lived. ""We had gotten a couple of questions about mermaids recently,"" NOAA spokeswoman Keeley Belva told CNN with a laugh. ""The timing may have been because there was a documentary or movie that came out."" The Discovery Channel's Animal Planet aired ""Mermaids: The Body Found"" on May 27, a two-hour special the show's website says ""paints a wildly convincing picture of the existence of mermaids, what they may look like and why they've stayed hidden... until now."" An editor's note on the page states that the show is ""science fiction based on some real events and scientific theory."" But the film takes on an air of academic authority. The documentary-style film features a number of people identified as marine experts as well as photographs and videos from fishermen who said they've seen mermaids. Former NOAA employees share their thoughts on whale beachings and government secrecy. 'The Little Mermaid' to get a dark remake . But the main focus of the film is scientific evidence and theories that support the idea of ""aquatic humanoids,"" as the NOAA calls them. Filmmakers animate how early humans might have moved from land to sea and chronicle the appearance of mermaids in art throughout history and among various cultures. The experts, narrator and even music are somber. Some viewers take the movie seriously. ""I honestly think it is selfish of people to think we are the only human creatures on earth,"" YouTube user Tjkitty67 wrote in a comment. ""There is stuff out there we can't explain."" Other users posted comments questioning government secrecy, debating the scientific veracity of physical similarities between humans and aquatic mammals or -- in most cases -- making fun of viewers who believed the fictitious aspects of the ""mockumentary."" ""Funny how the NOAA has to make a news report that mermaids don't exist because some misunderstood citizens of America start a debate of their existence just because they watch a documentary,"" wrote user WolfenOnTheDSI. But Athanson sees no harm in believing mermaids exist. ""Our mermaids here at Weeki Wachee can get really into it,"" he said. ""Whatever you believe becomes true. And if you believe you're a mermaid, you're a mermaid."" He said young visitors often ask whether or not the mermaids are real.

"(CNN) -- Common Western superstition says Friday the 13th is unlucky. But what does it say about a Friday the 13th with a full moon and solar flares that could create geomagnetic storms large enough to disrupt Earth's atmosphere? We may find out this Friday. NASA cameras captured three major solar flares this week -- events in which the sun hurls powerful bursts of matter into the atmosphere. When large enough, these bursts send shock waves -- called coronal mass ejections, or CMEs -- throughout space. These shock waves pose no direct threat to humans, but sometimes, on days such as June 13, CMEs can be large enough to disrupt GPS, satellite communications and other atmospheric systems, according to NASA. Just our luck. ""A CME ... has been observed moving at a flank from Earth and a glancing blow to Earth from this event is expected on June 13,"" said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in a statement. ""An outside chance of at most G1 (Minor) Geomagnetic storms remains in the forecast."" Translation: Despite the ominous ""glancing blow"" language, there's no reason to be alarmed. The disruption of communication systems in the atmosphere is still unlikely, even with the impending solar storms. People in remote areas of the Northern Hemisphere may even get a light show Friday night. Some scientists believe the storms will produce brightly colored auroras visible in the night sky, although others disagree. Either way, it's been awhile since we've seen such as an event. The last major CME to hit Earth came in 1859. Tony Phillips, curator of SpaceWeather.com, analyzed the last 17 Friday the 13ths ""for fun"" in response to a CNN request. He concluded that Friday's solar-related activity was an outlier. ""Of course, there is no actual correlation between solar flares and Friday the 13th,"" he said in an e-mail to CNN. ""(But) today ... is shaping up to be the most active of the past 10 years, albeit not by a wide margin. Friday the 13th in May 2005 was similar."" Phillips, who is also production editor for science at NASA, categorized only four Friday the 13ths in the last decade as ""high solar activity."" Thus, NOAA remains on watch. According to its website, ""forecasters are keeping a close eye on the Sun and we will update you should conditions warrant it."" Solar activity varies in its intensity, but there has been an uptick in solar flares and related episodes in recent years. This is not a surprise. This week, NASA released a statement dubbing this new solar activity a natural occurrence and part of the star's cycle of life. They called it a ""mini-max."" Because, historically speaking, it's not that bad. ""This solar cycle continues to rank among the weakest on record,"" said NASA adviser Ron Turner in a post online. ""In the historical record, there are only a few Solar Maxima weaker than this one."" He has a point. In all likelihood, the Earth's atmosphere, satellite systems and humans all will remain unaffected by the solar flares and their corresponding CMEs. Well, maybe we are lucky after all.","Solar flares this week are sending storms Earth's way .

"(CNN) -- British celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has long been on a mission to stir his countrymen's culinary senses but the gastronomic pioneer has now turned his attentions to an altogether more complex problem -- rustling up gourmet airline food. Blumenthal was in London this week to launch British Airways' new in-flight Olympic menu, which he has helped create alongside Michelin star chef Simon Hulstone. The luxury fare -- which includes dishes such as ""Rillette of mackerel dressed on a pickled cucumber carpaccio with sour dough croutes"" -- will be served on all BA flights for the duration of this summer's Olympic Games. The collaboration marks the latest link-up between commercial aviation and celebrity chefs as airlines look to improve the reputation of in-flight dining. ""However hard airlines try, the reputation of food on board planes is not very high,"" says Peter Jones, former chair of the International Travel Catering Association. ""Clearly, celebrity chefs are hugely successful and airlines are trying to overcome this stereotypical view of their food being unpalatable or stodgy,"" adds Jones, who is now professor in hospitality management at the University of Surrey in the UK. See also: Unsavory truths about airplane food . Other major flight operators such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Qantas, and United Airlines have also sought out prominent chefs in recent years as they attempt create a fine-dining experience in the sky. Gordon Ramsay has previously advised Singapore Airlines on its premium in-flight menus, which include offerings such as a pan-seared salmon escalopes, and tender rib eye steaks in red wine sauce. And 26-star Michelin chef Joel Robuchon is the gastronomic brains behind Air France's carte de jour for business-class passengers, with dishes that have included Basque shrimp and turmeric-scented pasta with lemongrass. According to Jones, however, creating the perfect gourmet airline meal requires a scientific awareness of how the human body operates at high altitude, as well as a keen culinary knowledge. ""Eating on a plane is not the same as eating on the ground,"" says Jones. ""Humidity is very dry (and) there is very little water in the atmosphere, which affects our taste buds and sense of smell."" Jones believes that by employing highly skilled chefs who understand this there is more chance of airlines getting their recipes right -- not to mention the positive impact it can have on perceptions of their brand. See also: 'Safe-list' flyers get security fast track . ""Airlines select products to go on their planes that are consistent with their brand image and the celebrity chef is another factor that makes up a portfolio of an airline's brands,"" says Jones. ""Their primary function may be to create new and interesting in-flight cuisine but it also makes airlines seem contemporary and in tune with the demands of modern customers,"" he adds. The benefits brought by this brand synergy are also recognized by Marco 't Hart, founder and editor of the Netherlands based in-flight meal monitoring website airlinemeals.net. ""It contributes to the 'we care for you' and 'we-offer-great-service' feeling some airlines are trying to create,"" says 't Hart. He is quick to add, however, that the food created by big-name chefs is often exclusively reserved for business and first-class passengers. ""When flying economy, you'll still be 'stuck' with the 'chicken or pasta' question -- if you are lucky enough to get a meal,"" says 't Hart, whose website has analyzed over 20,000 meals from various airlines around the world. ""On shorter flights the meals have been brought down to a snack, pizza roll or a simple sandwich. There are (also) the low cost carriers who offer buy-on-board meals,"" he adds. See also: Sign-up bonuses juice up dining miles cards . For those traveling first class, however, t' Hart believes the quality of a meal designed by well-known chefs is a vast improvement on much of what has hitherto been available. He cites his own experience flying with airBaltic business class -- which has introduced the Slow-Food principles of Latvian chef Martins Ritins into airline food -- as a specific example of the quality of airline dining experience that can be achieved. Some airlines, including Turkish Airlines and Etihad, are going one step further and bringing chefs on board to cook and prepare meals whilst in flight, he adds. But according to Jones it could be a while before any celebrity chefs are spotted cooking up a storm in the cramped quarters of an airplane galley. ""I genuinely don't see that happening except as a publicity stunt,"" he says. He adds that the technology on a plane is limited and the safety considerations of cooking whilst in the air means that those charged with preparing food on board will be restricted in what they are able to create.","Chef Heston Blumenthal has helped create a menu for British Airways .

"(CNN) -- Editor's note: Watch CNN's TV theme week Comic Book Heroes from June 10-17 on World Report, CNN Newstream and I-desk. Last week a smartly dressed elderly gentleman sat patiently in a crowd on a sunny afternoon in New York City awaiting his part in a super-hero movie. Unusually, for an extra, the man was attracting as much attention as the film's A-list cast. While Spider-man sweltered beneath his lycra suit, 90-year-old Stan Lee coolly answered questions from fans of his own, eager to know how he helped create the webbed super-hero, along with Iron Man, Thor, X-Men, The Hulk, The Fantastic Four and scores of other heroes of the Marvel Comic books. In an interview with CNN, the Godfather of comic book heroes downplayed his role in history, claiming he just did as he was told: . ""The publisher had me doing western magazines, crime magazines, men's adventure magazines, even romance and teenage magazines and one day he came to me and he said you know one of our competitors has a book called The Justice League and it's selling well and it's a bunch of superheroes, why don't we do some superhero magazines? I said OK, I wanted to keep my job so I came up with The Fantastic Four and the others and that was the only reason. If my publisher hadn't said 'let's do superhero stories' I'd probably still be doing A Kid Called Outlaw, The Two Gun Kid or Millie the Model or whatever I was doing at the time."" Lee admits that the superhero universe he co-created more than fifty years ago was almost entirely devoid of super-heroines. ""The reason there haven't been as many super-heroines as superheroes is when we first started doing these kind of stories, when Marvel was first doing The Fantastic Four and Spiderman and The X-Men there were many more men, there were many more males than females buying comic books so we always really directed our stories towards the male reader and we had male readers and male super-heroes."" Nowadays he says, the female audience for comic book heroes is huge and hopes to see the shift reflected in the stories and their characters. More from Comic Book Heroes: Islamic superheroes team with Superman . ""Little by little this field became so popular that the boys' sisters started reading the stories and getting interested in them. Now when we have a movie like Thor or the Avengers or Iron Man, you'll get as many females going to the theatre as males therefore I predict you will see pretty much as many super-heroines as superheroes as time goes by."" After half a century of seeing U.S. comic book giants Marvel and DC Comics exporting American heroes to the world, Lee feels it's time for a change. ""We figured it's about time that we had heroes who weren't just all American and what we would be more and what would be more interesting than having a superhero who is Chinese? So Stan Lee created The Annihilator -- an animated character which he hopes will become the star of a super-hero movie co-produced with China. ""He has many of the Chinese characteristics and virtues that one would expect in a Chinese movie but we have successfully transferred them to a movie of worldwide appeal but we haven't lost the feeling of what it's like to be a Chinese young man who is suddenly thrust in to an adventure which involves a super power and a super foe but he's guided by the background, his own background and his Chinese heritage, the things he's learned, the things he's experienced."" But how will China react to such an imported hero? ""I see no reason why a Chinese audience wouldn't love a Chinese superhero created by an American or created by anyone else as long as the character is exciting and authentic and interesting."" More from Comic Book Heroes: Test your knowledge in our superhero quiz! Lee is also working on the launch of a digital comic book hero for India -- Chakra the Invincible. ""I think that audiences throughout the world love superheroes. I mean you could go back to the time of The Odyssey, whether it's William Tell or El Cid. Every type, every nationality, every culture has had superheroes in their legends. People love that sort of thing. The Greek gods and so forth."" He hopes the rise of the super-hero blockbuster movie will inspire young fans to follow in his footsteps. ""Every generation has its brilliant young people who want to do these films and I think that more and more talented people get involved and as long as that happens we will always have new and exciting themes for these films."" Lee believes that this will ensure continuing interest in comic book characters which have stood the test of time. ""The thing about superhero stories, they are like fairy tales for grown ups. Every child loved reading fairy tales when he or she was a child. They were stories about monsters and witches and giants and magicians, well superhero stories have that same flavor but they are done for adults as well as for children.""","Stan Lee is CEO of POW!

"(CNN) -- What are the odds that Jenny McCarthy and Donnie Wahlberg will give us the '90s wedding of our dreams? The former Playboy model and current ""The View"" co-host revealed on Wednesday's show that she and singer/actor Wahlberg are getting hitched. ""I just got engaged!"" McCarthy gleefully shared on the ABC morning show while revealing her engagement ring, which features a yellow sapphire stone. Wahlberg popped the question last weekend with help from McCarthy's 11-year-old son, Evan, and on Wednesday joined his bride-to-be on ""The View."" On Twitter, Wahlberg, 44, had only one word for the announcement: ""#Happy."" This will be the second marriage for both McCarthy, 41, and Wahlberg, 44. McCarthy's marriage to director John Asher ended in 2005, and Wahlberg's nine-year marriage to Kim Fey ended in 2008. While McCarthy was pretty convinced that she'd never marry again, it seems being with Wahlberg changed her mind. The couple began dating publicly last summer, and in November the TV personality said that she was starting to view marriage as a possibility. ""You know, I've said on every interview that I was like, 'Never, I'll never get married again, ever,' and, of course, you never say never,"" she told Bethenny Frankel on her talk show, ""Bethenny."" ""I think he would be an amazing husband, so if he does (propose), I would for sure say yes.""","Jenny McCarthy announced her engagement to Donnie Wahlberg on ""The View""

"(CNN) -- When Daniel Okalany bought his first computer at the age of 21, he was hooked. Just two years on, Okalany runs his own mobile gaming company called Kola Studios from an office in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. Okalany recalled how he was able to buy the PC as part of a government scheme to get more computers into homes. ""It was a Tropix TT3,"" he said, ""My mum paid half for it and I paid the other half. It was about 1.3 million Ugandan Shillings ($500)."" Okalany soon went on to set up Kola Studios with two friends. ""Initially, we started the business in my home,"" he said. ""It's very common in Africa for people to play traditional card games and we make these games available on mobile."" At first, the company developed a two-player app called Matatu, a digital version of an old Ugandan card game by the same name. Matatu proved a smash hit, with 20,000 people downloading the game through the Mac App Store, Google Play and the Windows Store. Today, Kola Studios makes educational games with a fun twist. The company's zombie spelling game, Zword, is designed to help children and adults improve their English language skills. In order to fight off hordes of zombies, the player must spell words correctly within a time limit. ""The faster you type, the faster they die,"" reads the website's slogan. According to Unicef, over a quarter of the Ugandan population is illiterate and Okalany hopes games like Zword will help to tackle the problem. ""It was just a concept that we were experimenting with,"" he said. ""We wanted to put the app into schools to help kids to spell. There is a major challenge in the fight against illiteracy."" Despite Kola Studios' meteoric rise, the developer runs on a small staff of just five people. Okalany said the company is starting to take on interns but recruiting workers with the right skills is proving difficult. After learning how to use a PC as a teenager and studying computer science at Makerere University, in Kampala, Okalany is just one countless budding entrepreneurs to start a tech business in Africa. The continent's burgeoning smartphone market is giving Africa's enterprising individuals the chance to launch businesses, create jobs and develop a skilled workforce. Okalany said: ""Phones are more popular than computers in Africa. It's less than $100 now for a smartphone."" And mobile games apps are spreading. Nigerian startup Maliyo produces games that reflect the lives of average Nigerians -- including ""Okada Ride,"" in which the player weaves in and out of the pot-holed roads of Lagos, avoiding oncoming traffic. In February this year, South African developer Thoopid opened for business. The Cape Town-based company is one of many indie game designers springing up in Africa's largest economy. Just seven months after its launch, Thoopid released its flagship app, Snailboy. The game, which can also run on PC and Mac, features a cheeky garden mollusk as players go on a quest to find his shell, stolen from him by the sneaky ""Shadow Gang."" Thoopid co-founder RW Liebenberg said that Snailboy is attracting a wide audience and South Africa is fast becoming a hub for creative talent in mobile gaming. ""It doesn't matter necessarily what country you're in. It's not specifically about what games people want, or what genre they like playing,"" he added. ""If something is easily accessible, it's cheap and it makes me feel good then I want to play it."" And Liebenberg's comments are reflected in the figures, with Snailboy performing well in far away Nigeria and Kenya. As well as a sequel to Snailboy, Thoopid is already planning to roll out two more games next year. Finding the investment . Despite the success of Kola and Thoopid, funding remains a problem for many African entrepreneurs, who struggle to get the financial backing to expand workforces and reinvest in their companies. Thoopid is fully funded by personal investments from staff while Okalany and his friends ploughed their own savings into Kola Studios to kick-start the company. ""Eventually we got investment from the Savannah Fund,"" Okalany said. Based in Nairobi, Savannah Fund is a venture capital firm that provides $25,000-$500,000 investments in high-growth technology web and mobile startups in sub-Saharan Africa. Mbwana Alliy, managing partner at Savannah Fund, said: ""People are doing more of their payments, work and lifestyle on their phone. Whether that's looking up directions, looking for a service or buying something online such as music or games."" Alliy, who previously worked in Silicon Valley, said that Savannah Fund has nine investments spanning Africa from Kenya and Uganda to Nigeria and Ghana. ""As Africa sees its middle class rising, we're going to see people who want to consume. If this fund was here 10 years ago, this wouldn't have been viable,"" he said. The fund aims to address skills and the experience gap of entrepreneurs in the region through its Accelerator Program, designed to help individuals build a company and launch products. But Alliy is keen to stress that the Savannah Fund is not a social project. ""It's about building long-term sustainable businesses,"" Alliy added, ""we're not trying to quick flip things. We're not trying to get the same growth as Silicon Valley. I'm not here to just make a quick buck. We're going to stick it out."" With funding behind him and a growing team, Okalany wants to expand his gaming empire beyond Kenya and Uganda to more nations around the continent. The young entrepreneur believes Kola Studios can make a success of developing traditional African games, handed down from generation to generation, by moving them into the smartphone world. When asked about his ambitions for the future, Okalany said: ""If we can have the most played game in Africa that would be really cool.""","Africa's burgeoning smartphone market is driving growth in gaming apps .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Eight former Argentine military officers, including two one-time dictators, went on trial this week to face allegations that they systematically stole babies from political prisoners and gave them new identities. The accusations stem from the country's ""Dirty War"" from 1976 to 1983. During those years of military dictatorship, up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers. Jorge Rafael Videla was among the coup leaders who overthrew then-President Isabel Martinez de Peron in March 1976. He ruled as dictator until 1981. Gen. Reynaldo Benito Bignone ruled the country from June 1982 until the nation's return to democracy in December 1983. They are the two most high-profile defendants on trial for being the ""presumed authors of the crimes of theft, retention and hiding of minors, as well as replacing their identities,"" according to a statement from the country's judiciary. Specifically, the officers are being tried for the stealing of 34 babies from their parents, the court said. Approximately 370 witnesses will be called to testify, according to the judiciary. The trial could take at least eight months to complete. ""The most real proof that there was a system in the thefts is the living proof, the children who regained their identities,"" said Agustin Chit, a lawyer for the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who are among the plaintiffs. ""It's all the documents that the grandmothers in these 33 years were able to collect. There is no perfect crime and there wasn't in this case in relation to the systematic plan. Even the bureaucracy of the state apparatus left behind many documents."" Neither the defendants nor their lawyers made comments as the trial got underway Monday, but in previous occasions have said that those incidents happened during a war and that the trial has a political angle and is not about finding the truth. Carlos Pisani, whose parents were both kidnapped when he was only 37 days old, said that he's been waiting for more than three decades for justice to be done. ""We have fought for many years so that today we can have a country where we have justice,"" Pisani told CNN en Español. Unlike others who were stolen and given a new identity, Pisani was raised by his grandmother, who told him from a young age about the circumstances surrounding his parents' disappearance. He has worked with a group of youths that include some of those whose cases are being heard in court. ""There are lots of losses that you feel over time and that cannot be made up,"" he said of losing his parents. ""The physical loss is irreplaceable."" Videla was previously convicted in December of human rights abuses during his rule and is currently serving a life sentence in prison. Bignone was sentenced in April of last year to 25 years in prison for kidnapping and torturing 56 people. CNN en Español's Javier Doberti contibuted to this report.","Eight former Argentine officers are accused of systematically stealing children .

"(CNN) -- Investigators searching for clues in the Abigail Hernandez kidnapping case reportedly have a new focus: a storage unit on the suspect's property. That's where the teenager was held captive, sources told New England Cable News. The rust-colored storage container, which some neighbors referred to as an above-ground bunker, was surrounded by crime scene tape on the day of suspect Nathaniel E. Kibby's arrest, CNN affiliate WMUR reported. The New Hampshire Attorney General's office declined to comment on those reports to CNN. Assistant Attorney General Jane Hall said arrest and search warrants in the case will remain sealed for now. A probable cause hearing is scheduled for August 12, when evidence might be presented detailing how the teenager was found. ""It's remarkable how well she's doing,"" Hall said. ""Just to be able to endure what she did ... under any set of circumstances."" Hernandez, 15, sat just steps away from her alleged kidnapper at an arraignment hearing on Tuesday. Kibby, 34, was arrested Monday and charged with one count of felony kidnapping for allegedly confining Hernandez on October 9 ""with a purpose to commit an offense against her,"" according to prosecutors. He was ordered held on $1 million bail. His lawyer, Jesse Friedman, did not enter a plea at Tuesday's arraignment hearing, arguing that the charge against Kibby is unclear because prosecutors have sealed the arrest warrant. ""I have no idea what they're alluding to,"" Friedman said in court. The judge denied Friedman's motion to unseal the warrant. Hernandez returned to her home last week, more than nine months after she went missing on the way home from school. Hernandez's case drew national attention when the then 14-year-old girl went missing last fall. But the mystery surrounding her disappearance only deepened when authorities and her family revealed few details upon her return last Sunday. Investigators said Hernandez provided police with details of her kidnapping that were ""sufficient"" to warrant Kibby's arrest Monday. In a statement Friday, her family said they were cooperating with law enforcement and ""trying to focus on the peace and joy of the moment of Abby's return."" ""Right now, Abby is resting, extremely tired and in deteriorated health, and has lost a lot of weight. She is working to build her strength back and we hope soon she will be back on solid foods,"" her family said. ""We appreciate people's vigilance as they share the sketch photo that law enforcement has distributed and we hope that very soon this long, long ordeal can come to some closure."" On Monday, Hernandez thanked those who searched for her while she was missing. ""I wish that I could personally thank everyone who looked for me. My gratitude is beyond words,"" she said in a statement. ""It's an incredible feeling to be home and I believe in my heart that your hopes and prayers played a major role in my release. Thank you all for the welcome home."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Marina Carver contributed to this report.","Report: Abigail Hernandez's kidnapper held her in a storage unit .

"(CNN) -- Having worked on seminal teen shows ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""One Tree Hill,"" costume designer Leigh Leverett is no stranger to dressing high-school-age characters. But there's something about the teens from Mystic Falls that makes outfitting ""The Vampire Diaries"" -- which enters its fourth season with an October 11 premiere -- a unique experience. For one, Leverett has to make sure everyone on the show about witches, vampires, werewolves -- oh, and ""hybrid"" vampire-werewolves -- looks fabulous covered in blood, as characters are routinely stabbed, bitten and shot. Leverett is regularly tasked with finding six to eight of the same top or jacket to be worn during multiple scenes and takes. With all the gore, borrowing clothes from designers is often out of the question. ""We do a lot of mall shopping because that's the best way for us to get a lot of multiples,"" she said. ""Sometimes we need more than we can get in Atlanta,"" where the show is filmed. Fall TV fashion: Outfitting 'Revenge' But when episodes call for flashbacks, which might take place in the 15th century, a trip to the mall simply won't do. ""Even though they are more challenging than the contemporary clothes, I enjoy doing the flashbacks most of all,"" Leverett said, noting the period pieces that aren't made in-house are often rented from costume companies. Period pieces also come into play when Mystic Falls High School throws its annual Decade Dances. The trick to costuming such events, Leverett said, is dressing the human high school students like ""a teenager would interpret the period -- or at least what a teenager would pick out when they go to the fantastic Mystic Falls Costume shop."" The centuries-old vampire characters, on the other hand, are meant to look ""like they would have gotten things straight out of their vintage clothing storage closet,"" Leverett said. Fall TV fashion: Outfitting 'Pretty Little Liars' That's not the only way viewers can differentiate between the living and the undead. Leverett has created a dress code of sorts for each of the supernatural groups. While the regular humans on the show dress more or less like typical high school kids, the vampires have their own set of fashion rules. ""We try and keep them timeless and not super trendy,"" said Leverett, who started working on the series at the end of its second season. ""They have their comfort and what they like to wear within the realm of the decade."" Besides, with many of the vampire characters, trying to blend in as mortal teenagers, Leverett added, ""we can't get too crazy in the clothing department."" With one notable exception: . For characters Elena Gilbert and Katherine Pierce, both played by actress Nina Dobrev, fashion is especially important as it helps viewers tell the lookalikes apart. Fall TV fashion: Outfitting 'Scandal' When Dobrev is playing human teen Elena, she dons a lot of simple long-sleeve shirts and jeans; whereas Katherine, Elena's vampire doppelganger, is a bit more fashion-forward. ""Katherine has been around for hundreds of years,"" Leverett said. ""She follows fashion trends a little more. (Her clothes are) edgier and sexier than what we put on Elena."" And because the vampires that live within the CW series have the power to control people simply by staring at them, they get to don more expensive threads. ""Maybe they can compel the salespeople into giving them what they want,"" Leverett said. ""I like to think that Katherine saw (the) tan Michael Kors heels (she wore during season 3) on some unsuspecting Chicago socialite, and probably just compelled her to hand them over."" Fall TV fashion: Outfitting 'Gossip Girl' Then there are the witches, like Bonnie Bennett (Kat Graham), which Leverett said dress ""a little bit earthier"" with a ""bohemian flair."" For the men, whether normal or paranormal, they've got to look tough. ""These days you can't go wrong with a great leather jacket,"" Leverett said. ""Plus, they hold up really well in a supernatural fight.""","""The Vampire Diaries"" is heading into its fourth season, which premieres on October 11 .

"(CNN) -- Park Geun-hye made history Monday by becoming South Korea's first female president, pledging to secure South Korea against the threat of an increasingly hostile North Korea at the same time as mending bridges with Pyongyang. ""North Korea's recent nuclear test is a challenge to the survival and future of the Korean people, and there should be no mistake that the biggest victim will be none other than North Korea itself,"" she said. ""I urge North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions without delay and embark on the path to peace and shared development."" Opinion: Why Madam president may not be gender game changer . Reiterating her policy of 'trustpolitik' - a policy based on deterrence combined with cautious approaches to North Korea - she said she intended to ""lay the groundwork for an era of harmonious unification where all Koreans can lead more prosperous and freer lives and where their dreams can come true."" ""I will move forward step-by-step on the basis of credible deterrence to build trust between the South and the North."" She said South Koreans stood at a new juncture, confronting the difficulties of the global financial crisis as well as the threat from the North. ""I will usher in a new era of hope whereby the happiness of each citizen becomes the bedrock of our nation's strength which in turn is shared by and benefits all Koreans,"" she said. When she was elected last December, Park broke barriers in the patriarchal East Asian nation, though she is deeply connected to its past. Her father, Park Chung-hee, was one of the founders of modern Korea who took power after a coup d'etat and ruled heavy-handedly for 18 years before being shot dead by his intelligence chief in 1979. Read more: Park faces tough challenges . His memory still divides South Korea -- some regard him as the cornerstone of South Korea's present prosperity, others see him as a dictator who ignored human rights and crushed dissent. Although she has apologized for human rights violations during his rule, Park has been criticized for not doing enough to distance herself from his legacy. Still, any concerns about her family's past weren't enough to prevent 52% of voters from elevating her to the presidency. Park, 61, and her opponent, the Democratic United Party's Moon Jae-in, offered similarly moderate plans during the campaign, addressing income inequality, reining in the power of family-owned conglomerates and improving relations with North Korea. On North Korea, Park distinguished herself from former President Lee Myung-bak, who demanded an end to Pyongyang's nuclear arms program as a condition of economic aid, by offering a softer, carrot-and-stick approach. She visited the North Korean capital in 2002 and met with its late leader Kim Jong Il. Since then, his son Kim Jong Un has taken over in Pyongyang, continuing a policy of defiant work on the country's budding nuclear program, including a test earlier this month that drew widespread international condemnation. ""Precisely because trust is at a low point these days, South Korea has a chance to rebuild it,"" Park told Foreign Affairs magazine before she won the election. ""In order to transform the Korean Peninsula from a zone of conflict into a zone of trust, South Korea has to adopt a policy of 'trustpolitik,' establishing mutually binding expectations based on global norms."" Domestically, Park campaigned as a fiscal conservative, advocating tax cuts for business to boost investment and jobs and vowing to restructure welfare programs. At the same time, she promised soon after winning election ""to take care of our people one by one."" In a speech at the headquarters of her Saenuri political party Thursday morning, she invoked a phrase coined by her father, who also served as president in an era when he was encouraging people to pull South Korea out of poverty. ""I would like to re-create the miracle of 'let's live well' so people can worry less about their livelihood and young people can happily go to work,"" Park said. CNN's Greg Botelho and Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.","The inauguration of Park Geun-hye is held in Seoul, South Korea .

"Moscow (CNN) -- A historian has been arrested in central Russia after police found the corpses of 29 women, dressed as dolls, in his apartment, authorities said this week. The 45-year-old man, who police did not identify, has been charged with desecrating bodies and graves, officials said. Video released by police showed an eerie collection of what looks like life-sized dolls, outfitted in shabby dresses and headscarves, their hands and faces wrapped in fabric. Authorities say the man also stole clothes from the graves when he took the bodies. Russian Interior Ministry spokesman Gen. Valery Gribakin told CNN police couldn't figure out for a long time who was behind the ""numerous blasphemous acts against the graves and the dead bodies"" at several cemeteries in and around Nizhny Novgorod, about 250 miles east of Moscow. The incidents started about two years ago, authorities said, with each case producing a public uproar in the region. Gribakin said police went the extra mile to find the culprit. ""Our leading theory was that it was done by some extremist organizations,"" Gribakin said. ""We decided to beef up our police units and set up ... groups composed of our most experienced detectives who specialize in extremist crimes."" But even seasoned investigators and forensic experts were shocked when their investigation led them to the historian and the contents of his apartment, where the women's mummified bodies were found. The corpses were those of women who died between the ages of 15 to 25, officials said. Gribakin also said during the search the police found ""photographs and plaques from gravestones, doll-making manuals and well as maps of local cemeteries."" Police said the man is a well-known historian specializing in Celtic studies who authored many books and articles, and used to be a college professor at some point. State-run RIA Novosti and local media in Nizhny Novgorod identified the man seen in the police video of the crime scene as Anatoly Moskvin, a resident of that city. Russian journalists have retrieved articles written by Moskvin in local newspapers from the past several years, indicating his profound interest in and great knowledge of all cemeteries across the region. The suspect faces charges of desecrating dead bodies and their burial sites, a crime punishable by up to three months in jail or a year of correctional labor.","The man had dressed the corpses in clothing, police say .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Gunmen abducted an American development expert early Saturday, pistol-whipping him and his driver, and tying up his guards after getting past security by posing as neighbors offering food, U.S. Embassy and Pakistani officials told CNN. The U.S. embassy identified the man as Warren Weinstein, and a Pakistani official said he works for a U.S. consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia. He's is a world-renowned development expert, with 25 years of experience, according to his company's website. As Weinstein's security guards prepared for the meal before the Ramadan fast early Saturday, three men knocked at the front gate and offered food for the meal -- a traditional practice among Muslims during the Ramadan holy month, according to senior Lahore police official Tajamal Hussain. Once the gate was opened, the three men forced their way in, while five other suspects entered the house from the back, Hussain said. The men tied up the three security guards and duct-taped their mouths, he said. They pistol-whipped the driver and forced him to take them to Weinstein's room where the men hit Weinstein in the head with a pistol, and forced him out of the house and into a waiting car, Hussain said. He said Weinstein is in his 60s. There has been no claim of responsibility nor any demands by any groups so far, according to senior police official Awais Ahmed. Weinstein has lived in the residence in an upscale Lahore neighborhood for several years, Ahmed said. He works for JE Austin Associates Inc., according to Lahore police chief Nayab Haider. According to the company's website, the consulting firm is based in Arlington, Virginia. The site says he was heading what the company described as the ""Pakistan Initiative for Strategic Development and Competitiveness."" It also says Weinstein is a Fulbright Scholar in Belgium and is proficient in six languages, with a doctorate in international law and economics. U.S. Embassy officials are working with Pakistani authorities on the case, embassy spokesman Alberto Rodriguez said . The U.S. State Department this week updated a travel advisory for Americans traveling and working in Pakistan, warning that extremist groups operating in the country were continuing to target U.S. and other Western citizens and interests. It cited part of the reason for the advisory as ""reported"" abductions of U.S. citizens ""for ransom or personal reasons,"" including the kidnapping of a U.S. citizen in Lahore in June. No further details about that incident were released. Abductions are not unusual in Pakistan, though those targeted are typically Pakistani rather than American or Western. In early July, a Swiss couple was grabbed at gunpoint while traveling in the town of Loralai in the volatile southwestern Balochistan province, provincial officials said at the time. Three weeks after their abduction, Pakistani authorities said they believed the couple was still alive. Weinstein's abduction follows another high-profile incident involving an American in Lahore. Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor, was charged with killing two men in January, but was released in March after compensation was paid to their families. CNN's Nasir Habib in Islamabad, Pakistan, and Salma Abdelaziz in Atlanta contributed to this report .","Gunmen abducted an American from his Lahore, Pakistan residence, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Tennis top dogs are out to avoid another ""Wacky Wednesday"" at Wimbledon. Exactly a year ago, the famous grass-court grand slam experienced one of the weirdest days in its history as former champions Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova were knocked out and no less than seven players withdrew injured. This year, however, defending champion Andy Murray sidestepped a potential banana skin with an effortless 6-1 6-1 6-0 victory over world No. 92 Blaz Rola. ""I played well today,"" said the world No. 3, who next plays Spanish 27th seed Roberto Bautista Agut. ""He's just come out of college and broken into the top 100 so it was tough for him but he's got a good game."" Murray, who reached the French Open semifinal after a series of five-set slogs, was relieved to wrap up the second round match in just under 90 minutes. ""I felt like that cost me a little bit at the French Open,"" he added. ""If you can finish matches as quickly as possible it definitely helps in the long run."" Second seed Novak Djokovic had a few more problems in his second-round match, finally overcoming veteran Czech Radek Stepanek -- who beat Murray at Queen's Club this month. The Serbian world No. 2 triumphed 6-4 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-5) in three hours 17 minutes to set up a clash with Frenchman Gilles Simon, who beat Robin Haase of the Netherlands in straight sets. ""I was two sets up and had some break-point chances in the third and I should have closed it out in the third set tie-breaker, but credit to him for fighting,"" said Djokovic, the 2011 Wimbledon winner and runner-up last year. ""He's 35 years old but he's moving very well. Grass is probably his most preferred surface. He performs really well on the big stages as you saw,"" added Djokovic, who lost the French Open final against Rafael Nadal this month. ""He loves to engage the crowd, he's an entertainer, and it was fun from one side to be part of a great thrilling match, but on the other side I should not have complicated my own life this way."" Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky sent out a warning by sensationally repeating his ""Wacky Wednesday"" antics. Last year, Stakhovsky was a shock winner against Federer, saying afterwards: ""I can definitely tell my grandkids that I kicked the butt of Roger Federer."" The world No. 90 kicked ass again on the Wimbledon grass, this time sending in-form Latvian Ernest Gulbis packing 6-4 6-3 7-6 victory to book his place in the third round, where he faces Freance's Jeremy Chardy. ""Nothing was working from my side,"" Gulbis, the world No.12, told reporters. ""Two of my biggest weapons, my serve and return, weren't there. ""A lot of credit to Sergiy. That's why he beat Roger last year on grass. The guy has a good game plan. He comes in, he chips the ball, he takes out the pace."" Spain's seventh seed David Ferrer also succumbed to grass-court giantkilling, losing 6-7 6-0 3-6 6-3 6-3 to 2009 junior Wimbledon champion Russian Andrey Kuznetsov, who next plays Argentina's Leonardo Mayer. It's the first time in 18 grand slams that Ferrer had failed to reach the third round. Sixth seed Tomas Berdych went through to round three beating Australian Bernard Tomic, while Queen's champion Grigor Dimitrov also progressed along with Italian 16th seed Fabio Fognini, South African No. 20 Kevin Anderson, Ukraine's Aleksandr Dolgopolov and Croatia's Marin Cilic. In the women's draw, there was one upset as former world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka crashed out in the second round, with the eighth seed from Belarus losing 6-3 3-6 7-5 to 45th-ranked Serbian Bojana Jovanovski. Australian Open champion Li Na ticked off a 6-2 6-2 victory against Austrian Yvonne Meusburger, and the Chinese star will next play Czech Barbora Zahlavova Strycova. The 2011 Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova dropped just two games as she eased past German Mona Barthel, and the Czech will next face five-time winner Venus Williams -- who advanced to the third round with a 7-6 6-1 victory over Kurumi Nara. Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, a finalist in 2012, swept aside Australian Casey Dellacqua 6-4 6-0 while former No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki also triumphed.","Big names out to avoid repeat of Wimbledon's ""Wacky Wednesday"" one year on .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged to end violence and discrimination against gays and lesbians at home and abroad Tuesday, as the Obama administration moves to extend further benefits to gays working in the federal government. ""It's not right, it's not who we are as Americans, and we're going to put a stop to it,"" Obama told a raucous White House reception honoring Gay and Lesbian Pride Month. Earlier, Clinton received several standing ovations from a standing-room only crowd of several hundred during her address at an event co-hosted by the State Department's Office of Civil Rights and GLIFAA, the organization for Gays and Lesbians in Foreign Affairs Agencies. ""We are moving together in the right direction,"" said Clinton. ""We reaffirm our commitment to protect the rights of all human beings."" The White House event invited politicians and government officials as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender American from across the country, including young people ""who have stood up for equality,"" said White House spokesman Shin Inouye. At a similar event last year, six months after Obama took office, participants expressed frustration over what they called a lack of progress in confronting discrimination issues that the president had promised to resolve. This time, Obama received loud applause, cheers and whistles as he cited steps his administration has taken, including a new hate crimes law, extending federal benefits to gay employees and a push for an employee discrimination bill. The Obama administration is expected to announce Wednesday that gay workers will be able to take medical leave to care for the sick or newborn children of their same-sex partners as part of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which generally allows those working for companies with 50 or more employees to take 12 unpaid weeks off to care for newborns or children with serious health issues. ""And finally, we're going to end ""don't ask, don't tell,"" Obama said Tuesday of the policy that prohibits openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service. A bill that would repeal the policy after a Pentagon review is completed in December is before Congress, the president noted. ""We have never been closer to ending this discriminatory policy, and I'm going to keep on fighting until that bill is on my desk,"" he said to cheers. Attending the event was Janice Langbehn of Lacey, Washington, who was denied hospital visitation rights when her partner of 18 years, Lisa Pond, was stricken with a fatal brain aneurysm while on vacation in Florida. Obama mentioned her story on Tuesday, calling the way she was treated ""wrong"" and ""cruel."" Earlier, Clinton said she is asking embassies in Africa and elsewhere to report on rights of the local lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. The State Department also is placing more attention on ensuring gays around the world have access to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, and providing grants to human rights activists who are persecuted either because they are gay or defend gay rights, she said. ""These dangers are not gay issues. This is a human rights issue,"" Clinton said. She drew more rousing applause when she declared ""human rights are gay rights and gay rights are human rights,"" a variation on the phrase she famously delivered in Beijing 10 years ago declaring ""women's rights are human rights."" Clinton said she is equally concerned about creating an environment at the State Department in which gay employees feel valued and ""can give 100 percent."" That is why, she said, she supported offering equal benefits to same-sex partners of State Department employees, a move that encouraged Obama to authorize such benefits for gays throughout the federal government. She noted the State Department also has made it easier for transgender people to change their passports and, for the first time, the agency's ""equal opportunity statement"" will include gender identity. It already includes sexual orientation. CNN's Suzanne Malveaux contributed to this report .","President Obama pledges to end discrimination against gays and lesbians .

"(CNN) -- What will Narendra Modi's India look like? The country's prime minister-in-waiting -- a staunch Hindu nationalist and the Chief Minister of the western state of Gujarat since 2001 -- is a deeply polarizing figure and an unproven commodity on the international stage. Analysts predict his arrival in the country's top office will bring a marked change in direction for the world's most populous democracy, a nation whose modern character has been defined by the inclusive, secular and liberal approach of the Congress Party, which has governed for most of the post-independence era. The only question, they say, is how great a departure Modi's premiership will be from what has come before. ""There will be a big change,"" analyst and journalist Arati Jerath told CNN ahead of his Bharatiya Janata Party's (Indian People's Party) crushing victory at the polls. The BJP finished with 282 of 543 parliamentary seats, giving it a clear majority -- something no other Indian political party has achieved in three decades. ""The desire for change very clearly (is there)... I think people are looking for another kind of government,"" said Jerath. ""His vision for India is not the kind of inclusive, secularist vision that we have been used to -- it is a much more right-wing, pro-Hindu vision,"" she said. ""I ... see an increase in social tension with groups that are not included in his vision."" Administrator-in-chief . The 63-year-old former tea seller's immense popularity -- a Pew survey ahead of the elections found nearly 80% of respondents held a positive view of him -- stems in large part from his reputation as a tough, ""can-do"" administrator, the man with the medicine to kickstart India's stuttering economy. ""Modi is a good administrator,"" said Ramesh Menon, author of an unauthorized biography of the politician. ""He is very strict, gets things done. There is a fear element."" His popularity comes in spite of a lack of strong personal charisma. Seen as a hardworking and conservative technocrat, Modi had failed to establish an ""emotional connect"" with voters during campaigning, said Jerath. Instead, his claim to the nation's top office has largely rested on his track record since 2001 in charge of Gujarat, a state of some 60 million people whose China-like rates of growth in recent years have been eyed enviously by the rest of the country. 'The Gujarat model' The so-called ""Gujarat model"" of development means a focus on infrastructure, urbanization and eradicating red tape -- seen as a much-needed tonic for a country ranked 179th in the world by the World Bank in terms of ease of starting a business. A sharp contrast to the traditional approach of the outgoing Congress Party -- which has focused on promoting inclusive growth involving a raft of welfare schemes -- it's proven highly attractive to business. India stocks have risen almost 18% this year at the prospect of a Modi-led government. India's largest conglomerate, the Tata Group, relocated a car plant into the state four years ago, a move the company's former chairman Ratan Tata credits in part to Modi's involvement. ""In effect, (Modi) delivered in three days what other states which were also trying to woo us could only offer their best endeavors to do,"" he told CNN's Fareed Zakaria. ""No side deals, no quid pro quos."" The promise of economic development is just as enticing to the public, and resonates particularly with the increasingly strident aspirations of the 100 million young voters who were eligible to cast their ballots for the first time in 2014, said Dilip Dutta, director of the South Asian Studies Group at the University of Sydney. ""These young voters are exposed through electronic media to the whole world, and have a dream of moving forward -- not lagging behind as their fathers and grandfathers have for decades."" Greater inequality? But not everyone is convinced about Modi's economic prescription. Mohan Guruswamy, a political analyst at Delhi's Center for Policy Alternatives, told CNN that Modi's record in Gujarat has been overhyped. ""There is no 'Gujarat model,' and there are other states with faster economic growth,"" he said during an interview in the build-up to the election. Moreover, many feel that economic development in the state has been unequally distributed, and not matched with corresponding gains in human development. ""It really is a model that favors people who already have access to things like education and business possibilities,"" said Jerath. ""He offers very little to the poor, to the weaker section and I think that this is a major weakness."" While she believed Modi's leadership would see an increase in foreign and domestic investment, his corporate agenda would also likely lead to conflict with India's vocal civil society groups. ""I see a rise in social tension because people have become much more conscious and they don't want to to give up their land so easily just because Modi wants to clear the way forward for business,"" she said. ""There will be tension over forest land, there will be tension over agricultural land... It will be a very interesting thing to see how he manages the challenges."" Too autocratic? Modi's hard-nosed, occasionally abrasive leadership style will also present a marked departure for a country accustomed to a more consensus-driven approach, analysts believe. ""I see Modi as an extraordinarily ambitious man, quite ruthless in the pursuit of his ambition,"" said Jerath. Guruswamy, who knows Modi personally, likens his vision of a ""right-wing, authoritarian corporate state"" as closer to the model in China, and questions whether his divisive, autocratic tendencies will translate well in a country as boisterously democratic as India. ""It's not a place where you can press buttons -- you have to work with people,"" he said. ""The prime minister of India has to be the supreme conciliator, reconciling the aspirations and demands of thousands of groups. It's not like China where you can turn off Weibo one day -- you can't be autocratic or they'll cut you out."" Journalist and blogger Sunny Hundal also sees Modi as a challenge to the country's established liberal, secular order, writing in a CNN opinion piece that the signs were there that his government would ""be much less tolerant of criticism, hostile towards press freedom, and further polarize the country along religious lines."" OPINION: Does Modi threaten secular and liberal India? Modi and Muslims . The greatest concerns about a Modi premiership revolve around his ability, as a hardline Hindu nationalist, to lead a country as culturally and religiously diverse as India. Since he was a boy -- the third of six children born to a family of grocers in the city of Vadnagar -- Modi has been a supporter of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing pro-Hindu social movement. His track record with India's 180 million-strong Muslim community, the country's second largest religious group, has come under intense scrutiny. Less than a year after Modi assumed office in Gujarat in late 2001, the state was wracked with anti-Muslim violence, in which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Modi was criticized for not doing enough to halt the violence, but a Supreme Court-ordered investigation absolved him of blame last year. Modi subsequently expressed regret over the riots but was criticized for not apologizing. The U.S. State Department denied Modi a visa in 2005 over the issue, but after his win, U.S. President Barack Obama called Modi to congratulate him and invite him to Washington, according to the White House. The tensions are not merely a relic of the past. As recently as September last year, more than 60 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced in religious riots in the Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh state. Most of the affected were Muslims. Hundal notes that during the election campaign, Modi appeared alongside associates including a Gujarati politician who made inflammatory speeches speaking of ""revenge"" for the 2002 riots and called on voters to reject parties with Muslim candidates. Amid what many see as a rising tide of intolerance drummed up by Hindu nationalist groups, some Muslims fear what a Modi-led government means for their community. ""We all remember what he did in Gujarat,"" one unnamed Muslim man told CNN. ""For Muslims, Modi represents death."" Jerath said she saw religious tensions becoming more inflamed under Modi's leadership. ""I see these Hindu groups getting much more active; I think there will be renewed agitation to build the temple at Ayodhya."" Ayodhya, in Uttar Pradesh, is the site of plot of land that has been the subject of a longstanding dispute between Hindus and Muslims. Hindu hardliners destroyed an historic mosque on the site during a political rally in 1992, triggering riots across the country in which more than 2,000 people were killed. Noisy neighborhood . Modi's nationalist outlook -- informed by ""a sense of victimhood, that we've been victimized by foreigners"" -- would also likely be reflected in India's foreign policy, Guruswamy told CNN. ""Internationally, he would be a little more hardline on everything -- Pakistan, China, America. Indian interests would be aggressively asserted,"" he said. Jerath said Modi's foreign policy focus would be on India's neighborhood, which had been ""in a lot of turmoil."" It's politically quite unstable and a lot of India's internal terrorist problems stem from the fact that our borders are so porous,"" she said. ""That has to be the primary challenge for anybody who comes to power."" READ MORE: What India can learn from China .

"(CNN) -- Arkansas game officials hope testing scheduled to begin Monday will solve the mystery of why up to 5,000 birds fell from the sky just before midnight New Year's Eve. The birds -- most of which were dead -- were red-winged blackbirds and starlings, and they were found within a one-mile area of Beebe, about 40 miles northeast of Little Rock, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said. Birds fell over about a one-mile area, the commission said in a statement. As of Saturday, between 4,000 and 5,000 birds had been found dead, said Keith Stephens with the commission. ""Shortly after I arrived, there were still birds falling from the sky,"" said commission wildlife officer Robby King in the statement. He said he collected about 65 dead birds. The commission said it flew over the area to gauge the scope of the event, and no birds were found outside of the initial one-mile area. Karen Rowe, an ornithologist for the commission, said the incident is not that unusual and is often caused by a lightning strike or high-altitude hail. A strong storm system moved through the state earlier in the day Friday. ""It's important to understand that a sick bird can't fly. So whatever happened to these birds happened very quickly,"" Rowe told CNN Radio on Sunday. ""Something must have caused these birds to flush out of the trees at night, where they're normally just roosting and staying in the treetops ... and then something got them out of the air and caused their death and then they fell to earth,"" Rowe added. Officials also speculated that fireworks shot by New Year's revelers in the area might have caused severe stress in the birds. Rowe said Sunday there was evidence that large fireworks may have played a role. ""Initial examinations of a few of the dead birds showed trauma. Whether or not this trauma was from the force of hitting the ground when they fell or from something that contacted them in the air, we don't know,"" Rowe said. The dead birds will be sent for testing to labs at the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission and the National Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin. The necropsies will begin Monday, Stephens said, and the findings should be available sometime this week. The city of Beebe has hired U.S. Environmental Services to begin the cleanup and dispose of the dead birds, the commission said. The firm's workers will go door-to-door and pick up birds still in yards and on rooftops. CNN's Tina Burnside and Shelby Lin Erdman contributed to this report.","No birds were found outside of a one-mile area .

"(CNN) -- The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against Nelson, Georgia, a small town north of Atlanta. Officials in Nelson passed an ordinance in April requiring every head of household to have a gun and ammunition. Nelson's five-member town council unanimously approved the law, which says violators could be fined up to $1,000. The Brady Center, the legal branch of a long-running Washington-based organization of gun control advocates, says that Nelson's new law in unconstitutional. The ordinance exempts people who ""suffer from a physical or mental disability,"" felons, ""paupers"" or people who ""conscientiously oppose maintaining firearms as a result of beliefs or religious doctrine."" The suit says the law violates the First Amendment to the Constitution because requiring people to purchase a firearm when they don't want to own one violates their freedom of speech and their ""freedom to act or not to act."" The law violates the 14th Amendment because it creates two classes of individuals: heads of households and non-heads of households, the suit says. The suit also says the law violates the Second Amendment, because that amendment does not require, or permit the government to require, owning a firearm. And there are residents of Nelson who have suffered economically because of the law, the suit says. It says longtime resident Harold Lamar Kellett was ""forced"" to purchase a handgun and ammunition, which cost him nearly $700 -- a financial burden he should not have to bear. The ordinance ""has stripped Mr. Kellett of his right to determine how best to protect his home and compelled him to take action and communicate with the public in a manner he would not otherwise have done,"" according to the suit. Nelson's law was modeled on a similar law in nearby Kennesaw, Georgia, a measure that has been on the books since 1982. Nelson is home to about 1,300 people.","Small town of Nelson, Georgia, passed a law in April requiring residents own guns .

"(CNN) -- A Marine who fell from an aircraft during a training exercise was found dead late Tuesday afternoon, the Marines reported. Nobody knows how the Marine happened to fall out of the MV-22B Osprey on Monday, 1st Lt. Hector Alejandro, media officer for the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing at Cherry Point, North Carolina, told CNN on Tuesday. The aircraft had taken part in a training exercise at the airport in Elizabethtown, Bradley Kinlaw, Bladen County emergency management director, told CNN affiliate WECT. A crew member noticed the Marine missing about half a mile past White Lake, WECT reported. Alejandro said Marines in Ospreys are always supposed to be secured, either by seat belts or tether cables. He didn't know how the missing Marine was secured. Lt. Col. Christian Harshberger with Marine Aircraft Group 26 said the tiltrotor Osprey's cargo bay door remains open during training operations, according to WECT. The Osprey has the speed and range of a turboprop airplane but the vertical maneuverability of a helicopter. More than 100 Marines had been brought in to search on the ground and in the air, Alejandro said. The Marine's name was not immediately released. He was believed to have died from the fall, officials said. Strange noise, then fiery crash: 2 dead as copter falls near Space Needle .","NEW: Marine's body was found late Tuesday afternoon .

"(CNN) -- The United States will not bargain with al Qaeda over the life of an American worker filmed making an emotional plea to President Barack Obama to save his life, U.S. officials said Monday. ""We don't make concessions to terrorists,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said when asked whether the United States would meet the demands contained in a video posted Sunday to several Islamist websites featuring Warren Weinstein. ""My life is in your hands, Mr. President,"" said the American captured in August from his home in the Pakistani city of Lahore. ""If you accept the demands, I live. If you don't accept the demands, then I die."" White House spokesman Jay Carney reiterated the point, saying that while the administration's hearts go out to Weinstein and his family, ""we cannot and will not negotiate with al Qaeda."" Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of the al Qaeda terror network, listed eight demands that he said, if met, would result in Weinstein's release. The demands related to issues in the Middle East, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Somalia. ""It is important that you accept these demands and act quickly and don't delay,"" Weinstein said in the video posted Sunday. Toner said that U.S. officials had not corroborated the video and could not say with certainty that the man in the video is Weinstein. He said he believes Weinstein is likely being held in the tribal areas of Pakistan, but that the United States has no way to verify it. The State Department said Monday that U.S. officials, including the FBI, are assisting Pakistani authorities in the investigation. Toner said Monday that the government is staying in close contact with Weinstein's family. In the video, which is less than three minutes long, Weinstein makes references to Obama's daughters and to his own children; he says he wants to let his wife know he is ""fine and well."" Al Qaeda's demands include the lifting of the blockade on movement of people and trade between Egypt and Gaza; an end to bombing by the United States and its allies in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia and Gaza; the release of anyone arrested on charges of belonging to al Qaeda and the Taliban. It also calls for the release of all prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and American secret prisons and the closure of Guantanamo and the other prisons. The group also wants the release of terrorists convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and the release of relatives of Osama bin Laden, the founder of al Qaeda who was killed last year in Pakistan. Weinstein was captured after his kidnappers managed to overcome the three security guards who were protecting him. As the guards prepared for the meal before the Ramadan fast, three men knocked at the front gate and offered food for the meal -- a traditional practice among Muslims during the holy month of Ramadan, according to the Lahore police. Once the gate was opened, the three men forced their way in while five others entered the house from the back, tied up the guards and duct-taped their mouths, according to the police. They pistol-whipped the driver and forced him to take them to Weinstein's room, where they also hit Weinstein on the head with a pistol and forced him out of the house and into a waiting car, the police said. A police official said in August that three suspects had been arrested in Weinstein's kidnapping. Weinstein was working for J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia.

"(CNN) -- Australia's Prime Minister repeated Saturday that he has a ""high degree of confidence"" that acoustic signals detected in the Indian Ocean are from at least one of the two black boxes from the missing Malaysian plane, but predicted that finding them remains a ""massive, massive task."" ""It is likely to continue for a long time to come,"" Tony Abbott told journalists in Beijing, where he was on a diplomatic visit. Chinese officials appreciate Australia's ""transparency and candor"" in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, he said, adding ""I think it's to our country's credit that we've approached it that way."" More than 35 days since the plane vanished from radar screens early March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, the search continued. Up to 11 military aircraft, one civil aircraft and 14 ships will assist in Sunday's search for the missing airliner, the Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre said. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority planned a visual search area totaling approximately 22,203 square miles (57,506 square kilometers). The center of the search area lies about 1,367 miles (2,200 kilometers) northwest of Perth. During Friday's search, only a small number of the objects sighted from aircraft and ships were recovered; as has been the case throughout the effort, none was linked to the Boeing aircraft, according to the Joint Agency Coordination Centre. Still, the U.S. Navy commander leading the American effort to find Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 said he was ""optimistic"" about how the search is proceeding. The four pings detected in recent days were continuous and consistent with what a black box would emit, said Cmdr. William Marks. ""We've ruled out that it was anything natural, or anything from commercial shipping, or anything like that."" ""I agree with the Prime Minister,"" Marks said. ""We're optimistic."" Families skeptical . But the optimism was not universal. Relatives of the 239 people who were aboard the plane when it vanished met Friday with Malaysia Airlines and government officials. The mother of Pouria Nourmohammadi, the 19-year-old Iranian man who used a fake passport to board the plane, came away unimpressed. ""I feel the Malaysian government has forgotten about all things MH370,"" his mother told CNN on Saturday. ""These days there is not news. They only keep saying, 'We are searching.'"" On Saturday, searchers aboard the Australian vessel Ocean Shield were planning to continue towing the ping locator -- referred to as a TPL -- at a walking pace through the water in hopes of picking up new signals from either or both of the locator signals that were attached to the plane's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, Marks said. The more signals they can locate, the more investigators say they can narrow the search zone. ""We have to stick with the TPL for just a little while longer to make sure we have exhausted every ounce of power coming from the battery through the black boxes,"" he said. The batteries were certified to last 30 days, but the beacon manufacturer predicted they would last days longer. Once the searchers have concluded that there is no hope that the batteries could still be powering the beacons, searchers will lower into the water the Bluefin-21, a sonar device, to scour the ocean floor. The Bluefin's pace is slower than that of the TPL, he said. Four pings, one dud . On April 5, the TPL detected two sets of underwater pulses of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons. Three days later, last Tuesday, it reacquired the signals twice. All four signals were within 17 miles of one another. A fifth ping, detected Thursday by a sonobuoy dropped from an airplane, is ""unlikely to be related to the aircraft black boxes,"" Australian chief search coordinator Angus Houston said a day later. Tracking pings is only one early step in the hunt to find the plane's data recorders, wreckage and the people aboard. Imagining the search underwater .

"(CNN) -- Ziplining through tropical rain forests, rappelling down steep waterfall cliffs and whitewater rafting satisfy the rugged outdoor cravings of Costa Rica's tourists. But after a day of wear and tear on the body, a long soak in a natural hot spring can provide much-needed relief and relaxation for adventure travelers. Visitors to Costa Rica seeking a low-key, laid-back vacation will appreciate the hot springs, too. Costa Rica's rich landscape is dotted with these pools. CNN.com explored five locations that vary in size, luxury and tranquility. TabacÃ³n Grand Spa Thermal Resort . This tropical eco-friendly spa places its emphasis on making the guest experience ""a close encounter with nature."" TabacÃ³n's thermal hot springs are surrounded by lush gardens, with the Arenal Volcano and rain forest as a dramatic backdrop as you soak in the all-natural waters flowing throughout the property. Five springs, fueled and heated by the nearby volcano, range in temperature from 77 to 122 degrees Fahrenheit. TabacÃ³n was the first public hot spring resort in the Arenal Volcano area and is accompanied by a 102-room luxury hotel for guests seeking an extended visit. In addition to the hot springs, guests can be pampered with massages, hydrotherapy, facials and a full range of indigenous treatments. Many couples have celebrated their weddings and honeymoons at this peaceful oasis -- and can now share private time at the resort's new Shangri-La Gardens area, a space intended only for adults. The Springs Resort and Spa at Arenal . The Springs Resort in La Fortuna near the Arenal Volcano boasts 18 hot springs spanning four acres of lush gardens. Tucked next to the springs is the resort's five-star hotel, a 14,000-square-foot full-service spa, and a wildlife preserve with rescued jungle cats, monkeys, sloths, wild turkeys and a variety of birds. The resort provides every guest with plenty of options for finding the hot spring that best suits his or her mood and personality. Some pools have raging waterfalls, while others provide a tranquil rain-forest experience and close-up views of the volcano. Temperatures in the pools range from 83 to 103 F. Some pools are all-natural, while others are chlorinated. Day passes for guests not registered at the hotel are available for $40. These passes include entry to the hot springs and the wildlife preserve and access to four restaurants and five bars on the property. Hotel and day visitors can also reserve kayaking, horseback riding and ATV tours. Baldi Hot Springs Hotel and Spa . Located in the heart of the rain forest, this large resort boasts 25 pure water pools and takes pride in a its family-friendly atmosphere. Unique to Baldi is the resort's three large water slides, ranging from 104 to 325 feet long. The slides cater to children and adults alike. Numerous waterfalls pour into the pools, which reach temperatures up to 104 F. The temperatures in the waters increase as you walk higher up in elevation along a path to reach the various pools. The resort complex, which opened to the public in 2000 under the vision of businessman Alberto Rodriguez Baldi, is located at the foot of the Arenal Volcano and includes two restaurants, three swim-up bars, a sauna, 8 acres of colorful tropical gardens, and 32 nonsmoking rooms for overnight guests. Guests seeking total relaxation can retreat to the spa, where full-body volcanic mud wraps, massages and facials top the menu. Eco Termales Hot Springs . Eco Termales in the La Fortuna area does not accept more than 100 visitors at a time and is geared toward privacy. It's one of the smallest hot springs in the Arenal Volcano area, and many guests consider this one of its main selling points, since the crowds are small. This retreat, surrounded by lush green gardens, has been a labor of love for the Manolo Hidalgo family, which has spent years building and caring for the resort. There are seven relaxing hot spring pools, including one with a waterfall reaching temperatures up to 105 F. A restaurant serves authentic family-style Costa Rican dishes. ""I like this resort because of the lack of crowds -- and feel I can really escape from the world here,"" said Pablo Brenes, a local resident and manager of Anywhere Costa Rica, a travel agency certified by the Costa Rica Tourism Board. Blue River Resort & Hot Springs . ""Our guests say they feel as though they have stepped into paradise when they visit our resort,"" said Blue River Resort owner Daniel Apelboim. ""We aim to make visitors feel invigorated, relaxed and pampered."" Blue River Resort & Hot Springs is located on the north side of the scenic Rincon de la Vieja volcano and across from the blue volcanic river, Rio Celeste. It features four pools fed from the hot springs bubbling up nearby and is landscaped with rain-forest foliage, flowers and waterfalls. Each pool has a unique theme -- including a pool designed for children. There is also a freshwater pool with a 98-foot slide for both adults and children to enjoy. In addition to the springs, guests may want to explore the resort's botanical gardens and butterfly gardens, relax at the spa, or enjoy a cool refreshment at the tiki bar. Guests are invited to visit for a day or spend more time by checking into the resort's hotel. Rooms feature large terraces with views of the volcano and the lush green rain forest.","Costa Rica's rich landscape is dotted with hot springs where visitors can unwind .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri has claimed responsibility for the capture in August of a 70-year-old U.S. citizen in Pakistan, according to a number of radical websites known for carrying militants' messages. In the eighth episode of a series called ""A Message of hope and glad tidings to our people in Egypt,"" the speaker sent a ""message of support and encouragement"" to members of al Qaeda and the Taliban as well as to ""our female oppressed prisoners."" ""We did not forget you and we will not forget you, God willing, and therefore in order to release you, we have been successful, thanks to God almighty, to capture an American Jew called Warren Weinstein,"" he said. He described the captive as ""a former employee and a current contractor working with the U.S. government in its aid program to Pakistan, which aims to fight the jihad in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and just like the Americans arrest any suspect linked to al Qaeda and the Taliban, even if they were far related."" The speaker then listed eight demands that he said, if met, would result in Weinstein's release. They included the lifting of the blockade on movement of people and trade between Egypt and Gaza; an end to bombing by the United States and its allies in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia and Gaza; the release of anyone arrested on charges of belonging to al Qaeda and the Taliban; the release of all prisoners in Guantanamo and American secret prisons and the closure of Guantanamo and the other prisons; the release of terrorists convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center; and the release of relatives of Osama bin Laden, the founder of al Qaeda who was killed in May in Pakistan. ""Your government is torturing our prisoners, and we have never tortured your prisoner,"" he added. ""Your government signed the Geneva Conventions, and then threw it in the rubbish bin, and even though we did not sign the Geneva Conventions, we are honoring your prisoner."" The speaker said Weinstein's fate lies with U.S. President Barack Obama. ""I warn you of Obama's lies and deceit because he hopes that this man gets killed so he doesn't have to worry about his problem. Obama is a liar. He lies, lies and will lie. He may say to you, 'I sought the release of your relative but al Qaeda got stubborn,' so do not believe him. And he may say to you, 'I tried to contact them, but they did not answer,' so do not believe him. He may tell you, 'I do everything in my power to release your relative,' but again do not believe him."" He urged Weinstein's relatives to pressure Obama to accede to his demands ""if you want to bring back your relative."" A U.S. official said the circumstances surrounding Weinstein's disappearance have been murky, but added, ""It's entirely possible that al Qaeda or one of its militant allies may be holding Mr. Weinstein and the statement by Zawahiri supports this conclusion."" The official said that, based on the materials found in the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, al Qaeda's involvement with a kidnapping would not be surprising. ""The documents from bin Laden's hideout show his frustrated deputies were considering kidnapping and other criminal enterprises as a means of striking from their weakened state,"" said the official, pointing to the terrorist groups' failure to conduct big attacks against Western targets. Reached Thursday at her home in Rockville, Maryland, Weinstein's wife, Elaine, said, ""I just found out myself two minutes ago when somebody told me. I have nothing to add and no information for you."" Weinstein was abducted from his home in Lahore on August 13. As his three security guards prepared for the meal before the Ramadan fast, three men knocked at the front gate and offered food for the meal -- a traditional practice among Muslims during the holy month of Ramadan, Lahore police said. Once the gate was opened, the three men forced their way in, while five others entered the house from the back, tied up the guards and duct-taped their mouths, according to police. They pistol-whipped the driver and forced him to take them to Weinstein's room, where they hit Weinstein on the head with a pistol and forced him out of the house and into a waiting car, police said. A police official said August 23 that three suspects had been arrested in Weinstein's kidnapping. Weinstein works for J.E. Austin Associates Inc., a consulting firm based in Arlington, Virginia. He is a development expert, according to the company's website. The company did not immediately respond to a call and an e-mail seeking reaction.

"(CNN) -- A murder charge was dropped against one of three teenagers accused of fatally shooting a college baseball player in a random ""thrill kill,"" said the district attorney's office in Stephens County, Oklahoma. James Edwards Jr., 17, will now be tried as a juvenile on a charge of concealing a weapon, reported CNN affiliate KSWO. Edwards will have to testify against former co-defendants Michael Jones and Chancey Luna, who still face charges of first-degree murder. Police had said the three teens shot Chris Lane -- an Australian attending East Central University on a baseball scholarship -- in August 2013 as he was jogging in Duncan, a town of about 23,000 people located about 80 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. Authorities had said the three youths saw Lane passing by and shot him because ""they had nothing to do."" Jones and Luna have pleaded not guilty. KSWO reported that no gunshot residue was present on Edwards the day of Lane's death and that other evidence cast doubt on his involvement in the killing.","3 teens accused of fatally shooting Chris Lane, a jogger .

"Vietnamese Coast Guard 8003, South China Sea (CNN) -- It takes a long time to get to the middle of nowhere. For a contingent of almost 40 reporters, hours of waiting both on land and then at sea preceded a trip to one of the world's most hotly contested areas of maritime real estate. The Vietnamese government had been at pains to keep this media trip under wraps, keeping print, online and broadcast journalists from Asia and the United States guessing as to the day and time of departure. That secrecy may have been for naught: at a pre-departure briefing we are told that while the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not formally informed its Chinese counterpart of the presence of journalists in the area, a Coast Guard official mentions that ""chances are"" China knows about it. But depart we do, boarding a small coastguard support vessel Monday evening as the sun dies over Da Nang, bound for the disputed waters surrounding the South China Sea's Paracel Islands, known to China as the Xisha Islands. China's controversial installation of an oil-rig in these waters at the beginning of May sparked protests -- some of which turned violent -- in Vietnam and statements from a variety of world leaders, urging the two sides to resolve this dispute quickly and without bloodshed. One side, at least, appears to be in agreement. ""The Vietnamese Coast Guard are committed to resolving the situation peacefully,"" says Hoang Tuan Anh, the captain of the supply ship upon which we hitch a ride. Strictly utilitarian, our sturdy ride boasts one 25mm cannon on its prow and two 14.5mm guns aft. It is the kind of supply ship that every coast guard needs, and also houses a huge number of plastic 10-gallon jugs of drinking water, a galley piled with vegetables, and a bevy of live chickens under one of the exterior staircases -- supplies badly needed by their crew mates and friends on the front line. As the sun rises again the next morning, we're still chugging steadily toward our destination, claimed by both China and Vietnam. Vietnamese boat sinks after collision with Chinese vessel . Clear message . A mid-sea ship change to CG 8003 -- and slightly less cramped conditions -- awaits us as noon approaches. By then we have reached the area where China had, earlier in the month, unilaterally planted a flag on this area of supposedly oil rich sea. The flag, in this case, was an imposing oil-rig that sent a clear message: the Xisha Islands are ours to do with what we will. No buoys mark the territory, and there is no landfall in sight: just a shimmering expanse of deep water, albeit one with the promise of fossil fuel riches beneath. As we arrive news comes that the rig -- run by state-owned oil company the China National Offshore Oil Corporation's (CNOOC) -- has been moved: no small task for something as big and unwieldy -- yet politically volatile. The operation to move the structure began on Monday morning and was completed by 10.30 p.m. local time, just hours after our voyage began but, equally, hours before we arrived in the zone. Approaching the area, dots on the horizon become ships, which then become a flotilla -- or perhaps more accurately two separate flotilla -- of both Chinese and Vietnamese commercial and coast guard vessels. This mishmash of fishing and military vessels is all that remains of the flashpoint of a couple of weeks ago, and in a seemingly stage-crafted set of maneuvers dance around this expanse of utterly blue, clear sea. Aggressive foghorns . It's a lively affair, alternating between angry, static-y rhetoric that informs the Chinese that they are in violation of international law, and aggressive foghorns and sirens, raising a cacophony on this otherwise peaceful, sunny afternoon. ""I've traveled out to these waters many times but recently the Chinese have been more aggressive towards the Vietnamese,"" says Hoang, captain of the support vessel. ""I'm proud to protect Vietnam."" The dance is supervised by the respective country's coast guard vessels, who hopefully have too much sense to engage directly with each other. But hanging over the day's events is the knowledge that just hours before, a Chinese fishing vessel had rammed and sunk one of its Vietnamese counterparts. No lives were lost in this incident but it is the first time that a boat has been sunk in this chapter of the often-acrimonious relationship between these two ideologically similar neighbors. As the afternoon begins to wrap up, one of the larger Chinese coast-guard vessel homes in on our ship, horn blasting incoherently as it attempts a little maritime brinksmanship. Nobody on board CG 8003 seems to be overly worried, although life jackets are donned as a fillip. Like a dog reaching the end of its chain, the Chinese vessel barks at us a few remaining times, before turning heel. Off the starboard bow, two other Chinese vessels harry a smaller Vietnamese fishing boat, pushing it further from the center of this disagreement which, if left untended, could have dramatic consequences for these two countries, key players in a region that is -- perhaps belatedly -- starting to buck under the weight of Chinese hegemony.","China, Vietnam dispute the waters around the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea .

"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and Chief National Correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. Herbert Hale lives on a check of a little less than $17 a week and whatever he can pick up from odd jobs. CHERRY CREEK, South Dakota (CNN) -- The tiny one-room house rests on a hill; no electricity and no running water. A creaky metal cot and a rusting wood-burning stove is all the comfort Herbert Hale says he needs. ""All it is is logs, glue -- dirt and water put together -- then cement and the chicken string,"" Hale says of his home. ""Long as the windows don't break, it's nice and warm in here."" The roof leaks a bit, and the floorboards are rotted in one corner, but Hale isn't one to complain. ""It's home,"" he says, almost under his breath, as he invites a visitor to have a look. Firewood is stacked in one corner inside, and more outside as Hale uses the summer months to stockpile for prairie winters, where 20 below zero is not all that uncommon. He also pulls bunches of long weeds in the prairie grass, to dry for use as a firestarter. ""I have to be careful,"" Hale says matter-of-factly as he pulls a few fistfuls. ""Sometimes there are some snakes. Rattlesnakes. Nothing to mess around with."" He is 54 years old, a member of the Lakota tribe and part of two stunning statistics, even as communities across America deal with the pain and challenges of recession: . Hale worked 16 years as a firefighter. But he began having some back problems in the early 1980s and then, ""cancer caught up with me. I have a brain tumor."" He says he gets a check for just shy of $17 every week from a tribal welfare fund, and tries to find odd jobs to pay for his food and to help out a diabetic sister. But there's a catch: Tiny Cherry Creek has no such jobs. There are one or two one-room homes like Hale's, but it is mostly a collection of a couple dozen simple modular homes provided by a federal and tribal housing program. It doesn't even have a gas station or general store. So Hale heads out most days toward Eagle Butte -- 17 miles up one road and then 21 miles more up the next. A few more twists and, ""It's about 42 to 43 miles, someplace around there."" Herbert Hale can't afford a car. ""Well, I take off, go to my sister's, then get some water and take off. Somebody along the way will pick me up."" Often, that somebody is Bryce In The Woods, a member of the tribal council whose district includes Cherry Creek. ""It is bad,"" he says of the area's economic plight, walking a visitor through the gravel streets where many residents, idle because of the lack of jobs, are sitting out front or shout out a greeting from inside their small homes. To spend a day crossing the reservation is to see a place stunningly beautiful and seemingly forgotten all at once, small, poor communities tucked into the hollows of western South Dakota's Cheyenne River Reservation. The poverty is all the more striking because of the richness of the setting: green and golden rolling hills, roaming horses and cattle, and tall corn and golden sunflowers sprouting from the fertile soil. ""Ziebach County is the No. 1 county statistically with child poverty,"" he said. ""Now that alone is generational, with the trauma of poverty and the broken family."" Breaking that cycle is Bryce In The Woods' obsession. He highlights a bright spot: A building in the community converted to a makeshift classroom and library where residents can get tutoring help and then take the GED --- the high school equivalency exam. ""It is so difficult,"" he says of the challenge facing younger reservation residents. ""Some of our young people join the services, the armed services, some of them go to college or apply to college,"" Bryce In The Woods told us. ""The majority, if they are staying here, end up moving to Rapid City or some of the bigger cities to try to find employment."" In Eagle Butte, the largest community on the reservation, a bustling construction site is a new source of pride. A medical center is under construction, thanks to funding from the Obama administration's stimulus plan, and Bryce In The Woods says about 65 construction-related jobs so far have gone to tribal members. ""At this point I am very appreciative of what we have received,"" Joseph Brings Plenty, the elected tribal chairman, says when we ask if the stimulus funding is enough. ""But as far as expectation, I can say no. There would be a lot more need to be fulfilled by the U.S. government for our tribe before I can say yes."" Outside, Brings Plenty's office is a ""First Americans for Obama"" sign -- a reminder the tribe was an early backer of Barack Obama. Brings Plenty says he hopes the president remembers. ""I can sympathize, empathize, with the demands, with the pressures that are on his shoulders, on his plate and put in front of him,"" Brings Plenty said during a break from a Tribal Council meeting. The biggest help Obama and Congress could give, the chairman and others told us, is greater water rights. The tribe has money for more housing, but can't build because the water pressure is too low and its treatment systems too outdated to handle increased demand. ""I feel that we are forgotten because we don't have that voice out there,"" Chairman Brings Plenty said. ""It's demoralizing in a way for some of our members that go out and receive an education and come back and are unable to get a job here."" To be clear, Chairman Brings Plenty and Bryce In the Woods say not all of the tribe's problems rest with the federal government. Both mentioned obstacles and disagreements born of factional tribal politics and rivalries, which were in full evidence during just a few minutes of the Tribal Council's debate. In The Woods is also a strong advocate for land reforms he says would get the tribe a better deal for grazing rights on its property. Still, they would welcome more economic development help, from the state and from Washington, but say their voices don't always get heard, even in the best of times. ""When it comes down to a vote, a lot of the urban representatives, I don't think they really know the plight on the reservation,"" Bryce In the Woods said. ""I think there is a stereotype out there that all tribes have casinos and that's not true."" Herbert Hale shrugs when asked if Washington has a responsibility to help his struggling community. ""I can't really say,"" he said quietly. ""I'm not into politics to tell you the truth. I was when I was younger, back in the '80s."" Now, he lives the simplest of lives. A few hours of work if he is lucky, and perhaps an hour or two collecting wood, even in the scorching August sun. The temperature neared 100 degrees on the day of our visit, yet Hale's wood stove was warm to the touch. Prairie mornings can still be chilly. More important, memories of winter's past remind Hale of the value of his growing stockpile. ""Sometimes it's a long walk,"" he says. ""Especially in February. Twenty below and I have to walk. Often no cars ... A few times I felt like falling asleep on the road. I told myself, 'Fall asleep, you're froze and you're gone.' I pushed myself to keep walking."" Once home, he has a battery-powered radio and uses a small kerosene lamp to pass time at night reading. He's extra careful because he recently broke its glass chimney, so the flame burns without protection from the winds that can pick up suddenly. Herbert's worries are more immediate than whether the president or any other politician understands his plight. ""They never stopped up here,"" he says.""If they did, I wasn't home."" On the odd jobs in town, $1 here and $5 there adds up -- not too much, but his goals are modest. ""You know, take the trash out. I sweep the front. A few dollars a day wouldn't hurt. That's as good as you need. That's all I care about. One day at a time.""","In nation's poorest county, about 56 percent of residents live below poverty line .

"(CNN) -- Travis Mills has no arms or legs. He is an American hero who served three tours in Afghanistan and lost all his limbs when a bomb exploded under him.

The retired United States Army staff sergeant spent months recuperating at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, but don't dare call him a wounded warrior. ""I'm not wounded any more,"" he said. ""I'm just a guy living life."" Recalling comrades killed in combat, he asks: ""How selfish would it be if I gave up?"" He snowboards, bikes and recently jumped out of an airplane with the U.S. Army Golden Knights parachute team. And now, he has a new admirer in Mike Rowe, the star of ""Dirty Jobs"" and the upcoming CNN series ""Somebody's Gotta Do It."" He met Mills a few weeks ago at a conference in Washington and wrote a Facebook post about their exchange to honor him this Memorial Day. As of Monday night, the post had more than 90,000 shares on Facebook. ""He has a motto: Never give up - never quit. He has a Foundation. He's featured in a new documentary. He also has a wife and a kid, and a deeply personal commitment to help other wounded vets cope with their injuries."" Rowe wrote. ""But when I asked why I hadn't seen him in any of the typical commercials and PSA's for wounded veterans, his answer was stunning. He said he didn't consider himself to be wounded. 'I'm not a victim, Mike. And I refuse to be portrayed that way. Case closed.'"" Rowe ended his candid post by reflecting on the holiday meant to honor America's military fallen. ""That's called a gut-check, and I could use one from time to time. Especially on Memorial Day, when the biggest decisions I face are what to grill and which type of frosty beverage to enjoy.

"(CNN) -- Allow us to take a moment to recognize Wiz Khalifa as the new king of #selfies. According to TMZ, the rapper -- who has a well-documented penchant for toking -- was arrested early Sunday morning at a Texas airport after a ""green leafy substance"" was found during a security check. But it looked like Wiz, who was born Cameron Jibril Thomaz, wasn't too stressed about the situation as he tweeted a pic of himself in jail with the caption ""Jail selfie."" Talk about making lemonade out of lemons. He also tweeted a picture of the barred jail door saying ""Free Trap Wiz."" That cry was quickly picked up by fans on social media who turned it into a hashtag, naturally. MTV reported that he was released after a few hours and charged with being in possession of 0.5 grams of marijuana. He has been cited for simple possession of marijuana in the past, including in 2012 before one of his concerts in North Carolina. The rapper's new project is titled ""28 Grams"" and is expected to be released soon.","The rapper was reportedly detained in Texas .

"(CNN) -- A former Georgia hospital technician was sentenced to up to six months in prison after pleading guilty to manipulating the mammogram records of 1,289 patients. Ten of those women were given false negatives, and two of them are now dead, a prosecutor says. Rachael Rapraeger told the patients at Perry Hospital that their mammograms yielded negative results when a doctor had never reviewed them, according to court documents. ""You played Russian roulette with the lives of essentially a thousand women in this community,"" Houston County Superior Judge Katherine Lumsden told the 33-year-old Macon woman during sentencing on Tuesday. One victim, Sharon Holmes, to whom Rapraeger gave a false mammogram result in December 2009, found out two months later that she had breast cancer and that it had spread to her lymph nodes, CNN affiliate WMAZ reported. Her cancer has been in remission for three years, the station reported, but that didn't mitigate her displeasure with Rapraeger. Holmes told WMAZ she wanted Rapraeger to know, ""I'm not a name on a piece of paper; I'm a person."" Holmes had a chance to speak directly to Rapraeger in court, reading from a prepared statement, ""You could have made a different decision, and my family and I would not be living this nightmare."" Rapraeger also received 10 years of probation and a $12,500 fine, according to the sentencing sheet. She also won't be allowed to hold any job in the health care field for 10 years, the sheet says. Although Rapraeger initially pleaded not guilty, she accepted a deal in which she pleaded guilty to 10 counts of misdemeanor reckless conduct and one count of felony computer forgery. The felony will be wiped from her record if she doesn't ""violate the terms and conditions of the sentence,"" said Dan Bibler, deputy assistant district attorney. Rapraeger will remain free on $50,000 bond, possibly for several weeks until a bed is available at a yet-to-be-determined state probation-detention facility, defense attorney Frank Buford said. He called the sentence ""very fair"" and said his client takes responsibility for her crimes and is remorseful that people suffered. Explaining why Rapraeger told so many patients their mammograms were negative, Buford said Rapraeger became overburdened at work and was only trying to please her bosses. ""She just got behind in her work and wanted to try and get caught up,"" the attorney said. ""She made a poor decision to start entering negative reports just so she could keep up. She didn't want to fall behind on her work requirements."" Holmes told WMAZ she was not happy with the sentencing. ""If I'm living a sentence of having cancer then you should live a sentence also: behind bars,"" she told the station. One victim who wasn't able to opine on the sentence is Miriam Mizell, who died of breast cancer in January 2012 at age 63. In a September 2010 interview, she told WMAZ that Rapraeger had informed her that her mammogram had come back clean in 2008. In spring of 2010, however, Mizell got a call saying she had been randomly selected to receive a free mammogram, she told the station. That test came back positive, WMAZ reported. ""I was lied to from the beginning,"" Mizell told the station. Asked about Mizell's allegation, Houston Healthcare, which operates Perry Hospital, responded with only a short statement from CEO Cary Martin. ""Notification efforts to the impacted patients commenced April 2010 and continued to completion or resource exhaustion in the ensuing months,"" Martin said.","2 of 10 women who got false mammogram results died of cancer, prosecutor says .

"(Wired) -- Airports are known for rules and regulations, a reputation that applies to the runways as well. Almost all airport designs are governed by regulations established by the International Civil Aviation Organization to ensure pilots circling Toledo or Timbuktu remain properly oriented and deliver passengers and cargo safely. Lauren O'Neil turns those strictures into art, with the help of Google Earth. The Brooklyn-based designer has made a meticulous study of airport runways and logged the results on a Tumblr called Holding Pattern. These views reveal beautiful compositions at airports that are nothing special at ground level. ""I've found even the most humdrum cities or outdated terminals can have beautiful compositions from bird's-eye,"" O'Neil says. ""Even Cleveland rocks!"" Dozens of carefully cropped images reveal common traits among airports, and the logic and order embodied by seemingly random lines becomes clear. Here are some tips to help make sense of the mishmash of lines and symbols you might see from seat 17F. Runway Math . Airport runways aren't numbered based on priority, but compass bearings. A runway that is 194° away from magnetic north would be simplified to 190° to prevent rounding errors, and the last digit is dropped, leaving it at 19. Fun fact: Most runways are able to be used in both directions, and when approached from the opposite side the runway's number is achieved by subtracting 18 or 180°. Flying Fonts . Airports use a specialized font to number their runways. It's highly geometric, which eliminates confusing curves and can be reduced to simple schematics, making it easy for groundskeepers lacking typographic training to recreate. The font apparently has no name, but the numbers are called ""runway designators"" in pilot parlance. Read more: Picasso's 'Blue Room' has a hidden occupant just beneath the surface . Look Out! Lines radiating like spokes around unpaved patches are common in many of O'Neil's images and act as warnings to pilots to stay off the airport's lawn. Many airports are built on soft soils, so a fully-loaded Airbus A380, weighing 230 metric tons at takeoff, will sink into a patch of sod quickly, requiring hours of recovery, repair, and rerouting. USA! USA! Not only does the United States refuse to get on board with the metric system and day/month notation, but we can't even agree with anyone aside from the Philippines on what to call the area of pavement where passengers get on and off the planes. From Cootamundra Airport in Australia to the Bloodvein River Airport in central Canada, this area is called an apron. Here in the states, we call it a ramp. Whatever you do, don't call it a tarmac unless it's actually got a tar surface. Flyer's Ed . A runway, like most roads, has a center line. But there are plenty of markings unfamiliar to drivers. Eight white bars that resemble piano keys mark the threshold and give pilots an indication of where it would be safe to touch down. Two large white rectangles are the aiming points—the areas pilots should, well, aim for, followed by touchdown markers represented by four white bars. Chevrons at the end of the runway mark the direction of a given strip, but if your plane hits one during takeoff or landing know that a disaster was narrowly averted. Read more: World's most stylish supercars take a luxury road trip . Lines of White? Ready for Flight! Lines of Yellow? Prepare to Mellow. No pilots actually say this, but it's good to know that if you see white lines and markings it means you're en route to take off. If you see yellow lines and markings, you're stuck on the taxiway. About the Artist . O'Neil always has lived under the flight paths of airports--a tiny municipal airstrip in her hometown and JFK in New York City--and grew fascinated by the cadence of departures and the changing flight paths over the course of the day. During a moment of wanderlust she opened Google Earth and started contemplating runway layouts from a birds-eye perspective. O'Neil traveled the globe, virtually, to create beautiful images based on bureaucratic design guidelines. With her art direction, Denver's broad expanses of dull grey concrete tiles became dynamic. Her crop of a runway in Wellington, New Zealand, laced with bright yellow lines became a work worthy of Joan Miró. And hidden treasures, like an inscription in honor of Amelia Earhart, was uncovered in the aesthetic wasteland that is Newark's Liberty International airport. Each image starts with a clear itinerary, but O'Neil is open to diversions. ""I'm really drawn to the patterns, line work, and typography on the tarmac—especially as it contrasts with the geography,"" she says. ""I was really inspired by the Madrid-Barajas airport after mapping it for Holding Pattern. Everything seemed so considered and straightforward, which lent itself to stronger compositions,"" she says. Turns out, MAD is considered a textbook example of good runway design, known for maximizing the flow of air traffic in a compressed amount of space.

"(CNN) -- Winning a World Cup can help bring a divided country together, but that sense of unity can all too easily be dissipated, according to France's Patrick Vieira, who helped his country secure football's greatest prize on home soil in 1998. Aime Jacquet's squad was seen as representing as a new France. Vieira himself was born in Senegal, Marcel Desailly came from Ghana, Lilian Thuram from Guadeloupe, Zinedine Zidane's family hailed from Algeria, while others were of Polish and Armenian descent. France's win was widely viewed as a rebuke to Jean-Marie Le Pen -- former leader of the right-wing National Front party -- and his anti-immigration stance. ""It was fantastic because we won it and we won it at the right time because I think politically, France was going through a difficult period and I think we won the World Cup and we showed to the French nation what France is really,"" Vieira, who was eligible to play for France through his grandfather, told CNN. ""We had the players from all around the world and I think we showed the diversity of the French national team, we showed what the diversity of the French people are. ""That's why it was really important to win the World Cup because we sent the message to the political world what we need to accept and what is the real face of France."" He added: ""We saw Paris was going crazy but not just Paris, France was going crazy and it just looked like a French revolution -- people in the streets celebrating and it was fantastic and this is when I really realized how football can be powerful."" Football, though, can only do so much, and Vieira, who won 107 international caps, feels that those running the country missed out on a golden opportunity to enable France to capitalize on that new found unity. ""When we won the World Cup, we saw the change but the change was there just for a while and I think that is the problem with politics,"" said Vieira. ""Things change really quick and people were using the success of the national team to promote themselves and that was a big issue,"" he said. ""But I think winning the World Cup changed a lot of things for people because it gave people more belief, more confidence in themselves, how they can adapt and stand up for what they think is right, and I think it helped people to fight against racism and I think that was good."" Sixteen years after les bleus' World Cup success racism is still a problem in France and last year the country's most prominent black politician Christiane Taubira was featured on the cover of the far right weekly magazine with the words: ""Crafty as a monkey, Taubira gets her banana back."" Antisemitic attitudes are also prevalent. Former France international Nicolas Anelka was banned for five matches and fined Â£80,000 ($135,000) in February for making a ""quenelle"" gesture -- a sign believed to be an inverted Nazi salute -- although the striker denied that it had any antisemitic connotations. ""With what is going on in France, I feel the country is still divided because I think religion and people taking part try to divide people,"" Vieira said. ""I think we have to accept our differences and the way to accept it is education. I think we have to even promote more education. ""I think we have to talk more about our differences and not be ashamed of it and just accept who we are as a person and try to accept other people's differences as well, and I believe this is part of a lack of education.""","Patrick Vieira says winning the World Cup in 1998 helped to unify a divided France .

"(CNN) -- The United States on Monday handed over control of a U.S.-run prison near Bagram Air Base to Afghan authorities. The handover of control of the detention center in Parwan fulfills an agreement between Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The detention facility has been a sticking point between U.S. and Afghan authorities, and tensions over the facility re-emerged this month with sharp words from Karzai that the commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force called ""inflammatory."" The handover deal was reached Saturday, but came a full year after the initial plan was announced by U.S and Afghan authorities. The original plan called for the prison and detainees to be handed over with six months, but in September, the United States ""paused"" the transfer of detainees, which include suspected Taliban militants and insurgents. The U.S. military has not publicly discussed the specifics of the dispute. But a military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN last year that the United States was holding on to several detainees over concerns about whether Afghan authorities will properly handle their cases and under what circumstances they might be released. Karzai has been adamant that all prisoners be under Afghan control. Last year, he called the U.S. failure to hand over all detainees at the facility a ""serious breach"" in the deal outlining the transfer of power from U.S. forces to Afghanistan. Tensions between the NATO-led coalition forces -- especially those from the United States -- and Karzai have escalated since a bomb blast in Kabul earlier this month that killed nine people. Karzai said afterward that there are ""ongoing daily talks between Taliban, American and foreigners in Europe and in the Gulf states."" The comment effectively claimed the United States was trying to foment continued violence inside Afghanistan, and it was quickly denounced by NATO and U.S. officials. Some experts say Karzai's comments have been fueled by frustration over the detention facility not being handed over, which he views as an attack on his country's sovereignty. In an e-mail this month to top commanders, U.S. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, commander of ISAF, warned of new risks of attacks due to rising tensions between NATO forces and the Afghan president, an ISAF official told CNN. Karzai's recent statements ""could be a catalyst for some to lash out against our forces -- he may also issue orders that put our forces at risk,"" Dunford said. Barbara Starr reported from Washington and Chelsea J. Carter reported from Atlanta. CNN's Jennifer Z. Deaton and Jake Tapper contributed to this report.","The United States transfers control of Parwan detainees .

"(CNN) -- After Israel's Maccabi Electra Tel Aviv beat Spain's Real Madrid in the Euroleague basketball finals Sunday, some people on Twitter responded with vile anti-Semitic tweets. ""Now I understand Hitler and his hate for Jews,"" one tweet read. That user removed the tweet and is now apologizing profusely, tweeting that his ""empty words"" were a joke and that he never meant to offend. Another hateful tweet said the Maccabi team would hit the showers after the game, ""but in the gas chamber, I hope."" That user appears to have removed his as well. He also retweeted an op-ed from the Spanish newspaper El Pais arguing that while concern about hateful tweets makes sense, such offenses should not be considered illegal. But to some leaders of Jewish communities in Spain, these and numerous other tweets crossed a legal line. ""We are standing up and saying enough is enough. We're not going to allow this anymore,"" Uri Benguigui, chairman of the Barcelona Jewish Community, told CNN on Wednesday. Various Jewish groups have come together to file a legal complaint calling for the offenders to be punished. ""To send a message to Spain that this is not OK,"" Benguigui said. It's not that the groups want these people incarcerated, he said. But they want some kind of sentence. ""There is a problem with anti-Semitism in Spain. I want them to fix this problem,"" he said. He pointed to a recent global study published by the Anti-Defamation League that found one in four adults worldwide are ""deeply infected with anti-Semitic attitudes."" In Spain, the study found, 29% of the adult population believed most of the anti-Semitic stereotypes in the survey -- the third highest number in Western Europe after Greece at 69% and France at 37%. 'Unprecedented' global study finds 1 in 4 adults anti-Semitic . European nations don't have the same freedom of expression protections that the United States does. ""When you cross a line, you face a problem,"" said Benguigui. Unclear how many anti-Semitic tweets . Many of the offensive tweets used a hashtag that included an expletive followed by ""judios,"" which means Jews. A software program found about 17,500 such tweets at the point that the Jewish groups complained, Benguigui said. The complaint triggered global headlines citing this number of anti-Semitic tweets. But in fact, many of those tweets were from people saying how offensive the hashtag was. In the interview with CNN, Benguigui said the groups don't know how many of the tweets using the hashtag actually were anti-Semitic. When hashtags trend that are offensive against any group, it's often due to a mix of people saying offensive things and those calling out the offensive messages. The same happened this week in France with the hashtag ""#MerciHitlerPour3945,"" thanking Hitler for World War II. Groups want Twitter users ID'd . Benguigui said his and other groups have identified five of the offending Twitter users. And he wants more of them identified. It's an issue Twitter has faced repeatedly in recent years. Last year, a French court demanded that Twitter identify those who post hate speech, the technology website ArsTechnica reported in a story on CNN.com. In 2012, under pressure from the French advocacy group Union of Jewish Students, Twitter agreed to remove some offensive tweets. Also that year, at Berlin's request, Twitter suspended a German neo-Nazi account based in the city of Hanover, marking the first time the company had responded to such a government request, the report said. ""We work very hard to protect people's experiences on Twitter, but sadly there are a small amount of people in this world who are intent on causing distress for others both offline and online,"" Twitter said Wednesday in a statement sent to CNN. ""On Twitter we have rules which govern how people can behave and targeted abuse and direct threats of violence are against our rules. When they sign up, Twitter users agree to respect them."" With more than 500 million tweets a day, ""we rely on our users to report content"" that violates rules, the statement said. To report any tweet, a user can open it, click ""More,"" and then ""Report Tweet."" A real person ends up reviewing it. On its site called ""Transparency Report,"" Twitter lists information requests from governments, removal requests and copyright notices. The company also works with different countries to provide information within different legal systems, and posts its moves at the website chillingeffects.org. Benguigui sees this effort as a sign of what Jewish people in Spain have been going through. ""We've been hidden for many years,"" he said. ""We didn't want to appear, didn't want to make noise."" He cites the Inquisition, which began in the 1400s and was not officially abolished until the 19th century. ""It's time to say, 'We are home, we have equal rights, we have the same opportunities as everyone,' "" Benguigui said. ""We need to educate people.""","Israel's team beat Madrid's in Sunday's Euroleague basketball finals .

"(CNN) -- It was an international who's who of horse racing super powers: Japan, Great Britain, Ireland, France, the United States and a resurgent Germany were all represented in the start gate of this year's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. As the field entered the turn for home, the grey and maroon racing silks of Sheikh Joann Al Thani nudged ahead of early pacemaker Joshua Tree -- and from then there was only going to be one winner. Five lengths clear, French jockey Thierry Jarnet had time to ease up past the winning post, flicking his whip in the air in celebration aboard Treve, later named horse of the year for 2013. It was a home success for the adoring Parisian public, but the victory yet again highlighted the newest force in global horse racing. Treve's success is merely one headline in a myriad of horse-racing moments coming thick and fast for Qatar, a country with the third richest natural gas reserves and a population of just two million people -- but a GDP of $183 billion. The first in the sport dated back to 2011 when the stallion Dunaden won the Melbourne Cup at the first attempt by owner Sheikh Fahad, cousin of Joann. It was a suitably dramatic event for anyone to make their mark; after a photo finish, the stewards took nearly three minutes to decide the outcome and award a prestigious victory to a horse that had cost Fahad a mere $150,000. To highlight that fact, just a week after October's Prix de l'Arc triumph, Joann -- brother of Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad -- left attendees at auction house Tattersalls aghast by paying $8.25 million for the daughter of 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo, a world-record fee for a yearling filly. And then in November, Joann announced further plans to make his mark on the sport by appointing Harry Herbert -- who runs England's prestigious Highclere stud -- as racing adviser to his Al Shaqab operation, with the ambitious stated view to be ""one of the leading forces in thoroughbred racing."" Veteran champion Frankie Dettori, meanwhile, has become Sheikh Joann's retained jockey after his split with Dubai-owned Godolphin. The rise of Qatar as a global player in the sport of kings has no previous equal. Not even Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Godolphin enjoyed anything like this level of success so soon despite plowing millions of pounds into it from day one. What is truly remarkable is the speed with which the gulf state has got to this point. The first major player was Sheikh Fahad. He watched horse racing on TV for the first time in 2008, attended his first meeting at the start of 2010 and, by April of that year, had started buying horses. Sheikh Fahad's first move was to give British bloodstock agent David Redvers a relatively paltry £1 million to invest. ""He was looking for someone to put his toe in the water, to have a feel for it,"" Redvers recalls. ""We had a huge amount of success in a short period of time."" In fact, in his first year of racing, Fahad's horses won 26% of the races he entered -- and that success paved the way for others to follow. ""When he won the Melbourne Cup with Dunaden it showed to the rest of Qatar Royal Family that things just weren't down to the Al Maktoum family,"" Redvers adds. ""So there has been greater investment from Sheikh Fahad's brothers and obviously Sheikh Joann. ""Sheikh Fahad's hunger for knowledge is extraordinary. He's an extremely good judge of horses and he's utterly fascinated, he's made some very good decisions and had some great results, particularly considering the scale of investment. It's not the case of the person with the most money wins. If it was, horse racing would lose its magic."" Sheikh Fahad has spent admirably but also wisely, pushing his acquisitions through Pearl Bloodstock and Qatar Bloodstock to feasible limits while still ensuring both are money-making businesses. After his early successes, Sheikh Fahad has increasingly tried to take more of a back seat in horse racing, allowing his brothers to come to the forefront, but along with Joann he remains the integral figure for his country. As well as the Arc victory with Treve, Joann has also enjoyed widespread success as an owner over the past 18 months. His portfolio of victories in 2013 includes Olympic Glory in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot as well as Toronado in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. But as of last week, he has announced his intention to up the ante and increase his stable of 110 horses in England and France with Al Shaqab, a breeding operation set up by his brother Hamad back in 1992. ""Our ambition is to have the most successful horse racing operation in the world,"" says his spokesman Nasser Sherida Al Kaabi. ""When he entered the race, he wanted to be number one. He doesn't accept being second."" Sheikh Fahad has also thrown his financial support behind two up-and-coming English trainers, Olly Stevens and his wife Hetta, by setting them up at Robins Farm Racing with Redvers' help. Olly earned his license in January before enjoying his first winner with only his second runner a month later. He has since enjoyed a first Royal Ascot winner with his first runner there, Extortionist, plus a first group classification success with Green Door at Doncaster. Stevens was first approached to take over Robins Farm on the day his twin sons were born, and describes the tie-in with Sheikh Fahad as ""all quite fortuitous."" ""He's massively passionate about the sport, hugely knowledgeable with it too,"" Stevens says of Sheikh Fahad. ""He's a great person to work with and he's really taken a chance on us. ""You couldn't ask to train for a better person. He loves animals and he loves sport, and he's very supportive. But also he leaves us to get on with the nuts and bolts day-to-day stuff. ""I hope he's pleased. He's certainly very optimistic about what we're doing. He's trying something new with us and we'll see what happens."" At a time when Qatar is in the sporting spotlight for the wrong reasons, with difficulties in the lead-up to the 2022 World Cup, its entry into the horse racing fraternity has almost virtually been one of positive stories and the sport's often close-knit community has well received these relative newcomers. It has also invested heavily in sponsorship, agreeing a 10-year deal for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in June 2010, via the Qatar Investments and Projects Holding Company (QIPCO). QIPCO also sponsors the 35-race British Champions Series, which culminates at Ascot in the richest day in the UK horse racing calendar with $4.7 million at stake. Both lucrative sponsorships are aimed at putting Qatar on the global map -- its latest attempt to use sport to improve its political sway. As Sheikh Fahad said at the start of his horse-racing venture: ""It opens a lot of doors for us. Sport unites the world, and that's the vision of Qatar.","Relative newcomers to flat racing have taken the traditional super powers by surprise .

"London (CNN) -- Now you see it, now you don't. New street art by famously anonymous graffiti artist Banksy has been removed from a wall just hours after it was tracked down to a street in the British city of Bristol. The artwork, called ""Mobile Lovers,"" shows a couple checking their cell phones while in mid-embrace. Members of the Broad Plain Boys youth center used a crowbar to remove it just hours after it was discovered, local media pictures showed. In its place, the youth center posted a note saying it was held at the club ""to prevent vandalism or damage being done."" A spokeswoman for the club told CNN the youth center had no plans for the stencil work for now. She said fans are welcome to view it, but they would be asked for a voluntary donation to club to help with the youth center's upkeep. As the celebrated artist sent his fans out on a treasure hunt, one devotee said she found the piece using Flickr and Google Street View. ""I was so excited, I popped down there and took a couple of photos ... but didn't tweet them because it's only held on with screws and I was worried the first person to go there would be a thief,"" Banksy fan Sally was quoted as saying by Britain's BBC. Bristol is where Banksy's art first appeared more than 20 years ago. Is it a Banksy? UK street art image appears to show spies at work . Secret agents . On Monday, Bristol Mayor George Ferguson welcomed the appearance of the image. ""It's good to see another witty Banksy raid on his home city -- respectfully painted in a blocked up doorway,"" he said. ""I hope it will be respected and protected as we would want for any other legitimate work of street art."" The discovery of the new artwork came after another piece, believed to be a Banksy, was found in the provincial English spa town of Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire. Clad in brown trench coats, dark glasses and trilby hats, what appear to be three secret agents huddle around a payphone box with listening equipment. The image -- apparently a comment on the issue of government surveillance -- appeared early Sunday, local media said, on a house wall. The location may be a reference to the town's role as host to Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, known as GCHQ -- the UK equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency. Banksy's last high-profile project was a month-long street art ""residency"" in New York City. Each day of October, Banksy unveiled new works of art around New York. The works were then announced on his website and posted to Instagram. Many of the surprise exhibits followed his signature street-art style: stencils spray-painted on streets, walls of buildings and under bridges. INTERACTIVE: Banksy takes over NYC .

"(CNN) -- The family of Lana Kuykendall -- a mother of three-week-old twins who is battling a rare flesh-eating bacteria -- realizes all too well that she ""still has a long road ahead"" after seven surgeries. ""We don't know what the next day is going to bring, so we're just trusting the Lord,"" her brother Brian Swaffer said Sunday. ""We're taking it one day at a time."" Her twins, Ian and Abigail, are being cared for by family and friends as their mother battles necrotizing fasciitis at Greenville Memorial Hospital. Their uncle told reporters from outside the western South Carolina hospital that both babies are ""doing great."" ""They are healthy and doing well,"" Swaffer said. They were born May 7 in Atlanta. At that time, Kuykendall was healthy but, a few days later, she went to hospital near her South Carolina home after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg, her husband Darren, a firefighter, told CNN last week. Since going to the hospital on May 11, Kuykendall has been ""intubated and sedated,"" her brother said. ""She does respond sometimes, you can see in her blood pressure. She has opened her eyes a little bit at times,"" said Swaffer, who has been going back and forth from his sister's side to his home in western North Carolina. ""But that's pretty much it."" Kuykendall's health is precarious, though Swaffer expressed gratitude Sunday it appears confined to her legs and has not affected her internal organs. That is unlike Aimee Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate student at the University of West Georgia suffering from the same disease. She has already lost a leg, part of her abdomen, her remaining foot and her hands, according to online posts from her father, Andy Copeland. Swaffer also gave thanks Sunday for the support that his sister, a paramedic, has gotten from fellow relatives, friends and the community, as well as medical staff. He pointed to two efforts in particular -- one by fellow EMTs called ""Loops for Lana,"" selling navy blue and green bracelets, as well as a fundraiser ride by the South Carolina chapter of the Knights of the Inferno Firefighters Motorcycle Club -- to raise money for Kuykendall and her family. ""So many people in the community have rallied behind her, and we're so thankful for that,"" Swaffer said. The condition that Kuykendall and Copeland are facing, necrotizing fasciitis, is rare. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 cases occur each year in the United States, though such estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. Caused by a number of bacteria, the disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The responsible bacteria are common in the environment, though they rarely cause infections. When they do, the body's immune system is almost always able to fight them off, according to experts. Occasionally, however, the bacteria find their way into the bloodstream -- either through a cut or an abrasion. In such cases, doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain.","Lana Kuykendall was healthy when she gave birth to twins on May 7, her family says .

"(CNN) -- During election season, phones across the country ring with more unsolicited, automated calls than usual. So it's especially timely that on Thursday the U.S. Federal Trade Commission held a Robocall Summit to ""explore innovations designed to trace robocalls, prevent wrongdoers from faking caller ID data, and stop unwanted calls."" A ""robocall"" is an automated phone call that plays a prerecorded message. If you hear a live person and it's a telemarketing, advocacy, or survey call, it could still be illegal if it's unsolicited, but it's not a robocall. Robocalls from political campaigns or get-out-the-vote efforts are allowed (and legal) under the FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule, as well as under most state robocall laws (except when made to cell phone numbers and a few other exceptions). Unsolicited commercial telemarketing calls are illegal, and rampant, in the U.S. According to new FTC statistics, this problem is getting worse, fast. In the last year, the number of consumer complaints about unwanted telemarketing calls soared 70% to an all-time record of 3,840,572 during fiscal year 2012. Fed up with the phone spam, over 217 million Americans have already added themselves to the National Do-Not-Call Registry. But this only solves part of the problem. Much phone spam comes from companies, groups and scammers that choose to ignore the law. Also, a large proportion of consumer phone spam complaints cannot be investigated because of evasion measures such as ""spoofing"" -- or hiding -- the originating phone number or caller ID information. To address the robocall problem, the FTC announced a contest at the Summit to find technological ways to curb illegal robocalls. The FTC Robocall Challenge challenges the public to suggest plans to block illegal robocalls on landlines and mobile phones. Ideas must include a technical proposal -- so options to, say, prevent caller ID spoofing would qualify, but nontechnical suggestions such as ""give phone spammers the death penalty"" are not eligible. The winning solution will receive a $50,000 cash prize, as well as opportunities for promotion, exposure, and recognition by the FTC. Entrants retain ownership of their proposed solutions. If you're interested in entering, the deadline for entries is January 17, 2013. The winner will be announced April 1, 2013. (Hopefully people won't think it's an April Fool's Day joke.) For now, here's what to do if you get an unsolicited commercial phone call -- whether a robocall or from a live person: . 1. Hang Up. Do not press 1 or any other numbers to get off the list. 2. Consider blocking the number. 3. File a complaint with DoNotCall.gov. It helps, but isn't necessary, to have the number from which the call was initiated. Remember that political and get-out-the-vote robocalls are legal, so there's no point in filing complaints about these with DoNotCall.gov. However if these calls really annoy you, then you might consider complaining about them to your government representatives. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","The volume of illegal robocalls is increasing in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Pittsburgh police Wednesday had six ""persons of interest"" in custody in connection with the shooting of three students near their high school, authorities said. One student was grazed in the head, another was struck in the neck and shoulder, and a third was hit in the leg and foot, according to Pittsburgh police spokeswoman Diane Richards. Richards said the six people being questioned were picked up at a house near the school. She said the shooting may be drug-related. ""We don't know if there were multiple shooters at this time,"" Richards said. ""No one is talking at this time."" One of the victims was listed in stable condition at Allegheny General Hospital, according to a hospital spokeswoman. Authorities said the injuries were not life-threatening. The shots rang out near Brashear High School shortly after the last bell rang at 2:46 p.m., said Ebony Pugh, a spokeswoman for Pittsburgh's public schools. There is a middle school adjacent to the high school. The students were approached by at least one gunman who came out of the woods and opened fire, the school spokeswoman said. They were shot while walking to their cars. At least two of the victims managed to run back into the school and notify authorities. The identities of the victims, in their mid- to late teens, were unknown. Richards said the shooting may have been in ""retaliation"" for an earlier incident but did not elaborate.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Athens' Olympic stadium suffered heavy damage during violent clashes between soccer fans and police, authorities said. The clashes left 20 police wounded, two seriously, police said. Fifty-seven people were detained and another 23 arrested on charges of violence against police and possession of Molotov cocktails. Police said they were provoked by ""a large group"" throwing sticks, stones, bits of metal, Molotov cocktails and flares. The clashes began two hours before a Sunday night match between Greece's two main football clubs, Panathinaikos and Olympiakos, was due to begin. ""Before the match, individuals who had already gained entry made a sortie from their stands, breaking stadium doors, attacking police and allowing others to enter without security checks,"" a police statement said. One Panathinaikos fan who was present said that ""there was a large group of fans that tried to get into the stadium through the basketball courts without tickets."" The match to got under way, but the violence resumed inside the stadium at half time, when dozens of Panathinaikos fans stormed police lines, authorities said. The second half of the match started almost an hour late, and was cut short by several minutes when fans started raining Molotov cocktails on the stadium. They ripped up seats and partly burned one of the stadium's two giant display boards. Police later displayed pictures of seized Molotov cocktails and flares. They also seized three, 16-liter canisters of inflammable fluid that had been placed outside the stadium doors, presumably to resupply the troublemakers. The stadium is a symbol of a modern Greek moment of glory. It hosted track and field events during the highly successful 2004 Athens Olympic Games. But it was never built to host soccer matches. It lacks turnstiles and heavy-duty security doors. Cleanup crews were at work Monday piling broken plastic chairs onto the brick-red rubber track and cleaning up debris with leaf blowers. The display board was visibly charred, and splotches of dried blood adorned the aisles. ""When these groups can get away with such things, it is because they were able to get away with them in the past, with no one being punished,"" Public Order Minister Mihalis Chrysohoidis said on Skai, a local network. Panathinaikos FC issued a formal apology for the violent clashes, and could be fined. Together with Olympiakos, it forms Greece's football powerhouse. The two clubs are, with few exceptions, the only ones to represent Greece in European leagues; but rivalry between their fans has plumbed such violent depths that the fans are no longer allowed to attend matches simultaneously, but are confined to home matches. ""The violence may have been partly provoked by the heavy police presence,"" one fan said. ""There were seven busloads of police at the game."" But police may have arrived in such numbers anticipating an organized act of violence. ""We knew it was going to happen,"" said taxi driver Konstantinos Kavdas, a Panathinaikos follower. ""One of the more extreme fan clubs was going to pay the police back for heavy-handed behavior during one of their basketball matches last week,"" he said. Greek football teams do have official fan clubs, but the vast majority of fans belong to independently groups not controlled by the teams.","NEW: The match was stopped when fans started throwing Molotov cocktails .

"Tupelo, Mississippi (CNN) -- People in northern Mississippi and Alabama huddled in hallways and basements as a string of tornadoes ripped through their states Monday, a day after another line of storms killed 16 people to their west. Two people were killed at a trailer park west of Athens, Alabama, on Monday, according to a post on the City of Athens Facebook page. Another person died in Richland, Mississippi, said Rankin County Emergency Management Director Bob Wedgeworth, bringing the storms' overall death toll to 19. That toll is expected to rise. William McCully, spokesman for Mississippi's Winston County, told CNN there have been ""multiple fatalities"" in his county. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley declared a state of emergency for all counties. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said the twisters inflicted ""severe damage"" around the town of Louisville, about 90 miles northeast of Jackson, and more around Tupelo. Winston Medical Center, Louisville's major hospital, was among the buildings hit, Bryant told reporters. ""We have had early reports that the Winston Medical Center has received damage from a tornado. Walls are down. Some gas leak is occurring,"" he said. State emergency management chief Robert Latham said authorities were grappling with ""multiple events over a wide part of the state,"" and that more tornado warnings were expected. ""This is not over. It's going to last on into the night,"" he said. State Health Director Jim Craig said hospitals in Winston County and in Tupelo had asked for assistance treating what were potentially a large number of injuries, but no numbers were available. There were no confirmed fatalities as of Monday evening, he said. The National Weather Service issued a tornado emergency warning for the area around Athens, Alabama, near the Tennessee state line, on Monday evening: ""This is an extremely dangerous tornado. You could be killed if not underground or in a tornado shelter,"" the warning stated. A tornado emergency also was declared in southeastern Tennessee for east central Lincoln, Moore and northwest Franklin counties. Storm spotters were tracking a large and extremely dangerous tornado seven miles east of Fayetteville, Tennessee, the weather service. In Tupelo, several buildings were destroyed or damaged. Buildings near a major commercial district on the city's north side were ""wiped away,"" Scott Morris, a reporter for the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, told CNN's ""The Lead."" Numerous trees and power lines were down, and ""quite a few buildings are destroyed up there,"" Morris said. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center declared tornado emergencies for several counties in northern Mississippi on Monday afternoon as the line of storms moved through the state from southwest to northeast. ""Basement. Now ... let's go,"" Matt Laubhan, the chief meteorologist at Tupelo television station WTVA, ordered station staff before walking off the set himself. Video: See meteorologist take cover . Sarah Robinson, a spokeswoman for the city, said several hotels and restaurants were damaged, but no fatalities or injuries had been reported in the immediate aftermath. Another ""large, violent and extremely dangerous"" tornado had been confirmed near Zama, Mississippi, between Jackson and Tupelo. A twister possibly a mile wide was reported outside nearby Louisville about an hour later. Another tornado was spotted near Richland, south of Jackson. And yet one more was reported near Yazoo City, northwest of Jackson, four years after an April 2010 tornado that killed four people there and 10 across the state, said Joey Ward, Yazoo City's emergency management director. ""It's still hopefully very fresh on people's minds, and that they take all of the warnings that we've been putting out all day very seriously,"" Ward said. Nearly 5 million people were at moderate risk of severe weather late Monday, while 31 million people were at slight risk, including those in Atlanta and Nashville. 'There were cars flipped everywhere' Monday's storms were Act II of a powerful weather system that brought punishing thunderstorms to the central United States. Tornadoes spawned by those storms killed 14 people in Arkansas and one each in Oklahoma and Iowa, authorities in those states reported. The hardest-hit area was Faulkner County, Arkansas, where a suspected tornado shattered homes, tossed tractor-trailers and killed 10 people in the towns of Vilonia and Mayflower. Two children were among the dead. ""There were cars flipped everywhere, there were people screaming,"" James Bryant, a Mississippi State University meteorology student, told CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday. ""It was a tough scene."" CNN iReporter Logan Pierce spoke of being awakened by booming thunder that ""shook our whole house,"" while iReporter Brianna Davis saw devastated homes, snapped trees and widespread debris Monday morning. Another meteorology student, Cotton Rohrscheib, described how the storm picked up his truck and skidded it about 120 feet down a highway. ""We were all hunkered down inside of the truck, and praying,"" he said. None of the truck's occupants was seriously hurt, he said. Holly Rose rode out the tornado in a closet and a hallway at her home in Mayflower and said she and her family were ""very blessed"" to be safe. ""Most of our roof is gone,"" she said. ""We had a separate structure -- the pool house -- that is completely gone. There are homes around us, two doors down, that are completely gone."" Monday's storms were forecast to stretch into the Midwest and Ohio River Valley, with much of Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky at a lesser risk of severe weather, forecasters said. In Alabama, numerous school districts announced plans to dismiss early Monday afternoon in advance of the worst weather. Faulkner County government spokesman David Hogue said it was ""entirely possible"" the death toll would rise as emergency crews search the wreckage of destroyed homes, including some only recently rebuilt after being flattened three years ago by another tornado. Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe said the storm was one of the worst to hit the state in recent memory. ""It's devastating for the people who have lost property,"" he said. ""It's even more devastating for those who have lost loved ones."" 'Tremendous' damage in Arkansas town . Vilonia Mayor James Firestone described a scene of chaos in his town hours after the storm. ""There's a few buildings partially standing, but the amount of damage is tremendous,"" he said Sunday. ""There's gas lines spewing. Of course, power lines down. Houses are just a pile of brick."" It was much the same in Mayflower, a town of 1,600 about 20 miles to the southwest. Authorities shut down a section of Interstate 40 after a tornado ""as much as a half-mile wide"" roared through the area, according to the National Weather Service. The heavily used road was littered with crushed and overturned trucks and cars. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers, who was in Mayflower, estimated the winds from the storm were at 130 to 150 mph. Emergency workers tended to the scene throughout the night. Shelters were set up at a high school and local church. Nearly 18,000 homes and businesses were without power Monday in Arkansas, more than 10,000 of them in Faulkner County, Entergy Arkansas reported. The Arkansas governor issued a disaster declaration for Faulkner, Pulaski and White counties, and President Barack Obama offered his condolences and promised storm aid to victims while on a four-nation tour of Asia. Impact Your World: How you can help . Damage in other states . Before the bad weather slammed into Arkansas, witnesses spotted a twister in the northeast Oklahoma town of Quapaw, where one person died, the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office said. John Brown, 68, of nearby Baxter Springs, Kansas, was traveling through Quapaw with his wife when the storm hit. He pulled into a parking lot, and a concrete wall fell on their car, killing him, according to the sheriff's office. His wife was treated at a nearby hospital and released. The same line of storms also hit Baxter Springs just a few miles to the north. Sixty to 70 homes and at least 20 businesses were reported destroyed, said Cherokee County emergency manager Jason Allison. A tornado estimated to be three blocks wide rumbled through the town of 4,200, he said. Aerial video shot by CNN affiliate KSHB-TV showed a trail of heavily damaged homes and other buildings. A sprawling storm front also hit eastern Iowa, killing a woman in the tiny community of Kinross in Keokuk County, the sheriff's department said. The one bright spot amid Sunday's devastation were the forecasts that predicted the severe weather days ago, storm chaser Brett Adair said. The advance notice helped save lives, said Adair, whose team witnessed the Faulkner County, Arkansas, storm, then helped victims. ""This definitely was not something to take lightly,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- The health of a South Carolina woman battling a rare flesh-eating bacteria has ""slightly improved,"" a spokeswoman for a Greenville hospital said Thursday, though the new mother remains sedated and in critical condition. Lana Kuykendall has ""undergone 11 debridement surgeries to remove tissue since being admitted May 11"" to Greenville Memorial Hospital, spokeswoman Sandra Dees said Thursday by e-mail. But unlike 24-year-old Aimee Copeland of Georgia -- who has lost a leg, part of her abdomen, her remaining foot and her hands as she fights the same disease, according to online updates from her father, Andy Copeland -- no parts of Kuykendall's body have been amputated. ""Last night, Darren told the family in his update that 'Lana's vitals and blood work is good.' This is a good day for her, and we will take it,"" said Brian Swaffer, Kuykendall's brother, in a message relayed by the hospital. Kuykendall gave birth to twins, Ian and Abigail, on May 7 in Atlanta. At that time, Kuykendall, a paramedic, was believed to be healthy. But a few days later she went to hospital near her South Carolina home after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg, her husband Darren, a firefighter, told CNN last week. Surviving a flesh-eating disease . She was diagnosed then with necrotizing fasciitis and has been intubated and sedated every day since, according to her brother and the hospital. A number of bacteria, which are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections, can lead to the disease. When it gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. The disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. iReport: I survived Flesh Eating Disease...barely . Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. Just last Sunday, Kuykendall had undergone seven surgeries for her ailment -- meaning she has had four more such operations in recent days. Swaffer said, as he did days ago, that the family is thankful the disease remains confined to his sister's legs. While hooked up to a respirator, Kuykendall is now breathing on her own, according to her brother. Her baby boy and girl, who are being cared for by relatives and friends, remain healthy and are doing well. ""Please pray with us that Lana will recover quickly to a point where she will be able to interact with and enjoy this special time in their lives,"" Swaffer said. Andy Copeland posted an update earlier Thursday about his daughter Aimee, who is fighting the same disease as Kuykendall in the intensive care unit of Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. She was with friends May 1 near the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when the zip line that she was holding snapped. She fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room, and doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Her father has written regularly since about her situation, with the psychology department at the University of West Georgia -- where Aimee had been pursuing her master's degree in psychology -- also posting online updates. On Thursday, her father wrote on Facebook that Aimee ""has finally stabilized to the point that she has not needed any ventilator assistance for over 24 hours."" ""Each breath is a victory. Each heart beat is a cause for celebration. When she opens her eyes, that is like a ticker tape parade down Broadway. When she mouths words, angelic hosts rejoice,"" Andy Copeland said. ""That is what each moment is like for us."" He described several such moments from earlier in the week, including Aimee lighting up after listening to a ""private concert"" from a musician who'd written a song about her, waking up to talk of ""treats"" in the hospital and sitting up in a chair. ""When the doctors put Aimee in that chair, their expectations were to give her an hour,"" Andy Copeland said, elaborating on the latter milestone. ""Five hours later, Aimee decided it was time to lie down. Had she been running an Olympic marathon, I think Aimee would have experienced a record-breaking, gold-medal moment."" CNN's William Hudson and Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report.","Lana Kuykendall has had 11 surgeries since being diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis .

"(CNN) -- Reaction was swift when the website TMZ released an audio recording in which a man purported to be Donald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers pro basketball team, made racist remarks. The n-word wasn't used, but the male voice on the audio recording complained that his girlfriend posted Instagram photos of herself with black men, including former pro basketball star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. ""Don't bring him to my games,"" the male voice commanded. Current and former players castigated Sterling. Talking heads called for the National Basketball Association to kick him out of the game. Then another website posted another, similar audio recording. More angry words. This uproar won't die down any time soon. A basketball team puts five players on the floor. In that spirit, here are five of the key players in the Sterling controversy: . 1. Donald Sterling . Sterling, 80, has made a fortune as a lawyer, real estate developer and entrepreneur. He's the longest-tenured team owner in the NBA. He acquired the Clippers in 1981 for $12.5 million, and now the team is valued at $575 million, according to Forbes magazine. The magazine says his net worth is $1.9 billion. Sterling hasn't commented extensively since the audio recordings were released, but a Clippers official said Sterling is ""emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with, nor does it reflect his views, beliefs or feelings."" He doesn't mind a battle. He has a history of fighting housing discrimination claims in court. Elgin Baylor, former general manager of the Clippers, sued for wrongful termination and said Sterling treated him ""as a token because of his race."" How will Sterling respond if the NBA investigation finds he did, in fact, make these comments? Will he fight? How far could the NBA go to punish an owner? These questions might overshadow the on-court drama of the NBA playoffs in coming months. 2. V. Stiviano . She is the other voice on the recording, but she did not leak it to the media, Stiviano's attorney says. Stiviano, who according to public records is 31 years old, isn't commenting on the controversy. On the tape, she is heard emphasizing that she is of mixed race. She calls herself an artist, writer, chef, poet, stylist and philanthropist. Sterling's wife calls her a mistress and a gold digger. Rochelle Sterling filed a lawsuit last month against Stiviano, accusing her of targeting extremely wealthy older men. 3. Kevin Johnson . Kevin Johnson is now the face and voice of the National Basketball Players Association, the union seeking swift action in the Donald Sterling controversy. Johnson, 49, has credibility on at least two levels. Pro basketball players respect him because he's a former all-star in the NBA, having played 12 seasons in Cleveland and Phoenix. He's also enjoyed political success as mayor of Sacramento, California, since 2008. He's the city's first African-American mayor. Before the Sterling controversy broke, the NBPA had asked for his guidance in finding a new executive director for the group. On Saturday, the NBPA asked him to help ""determine our response and our next steps"" to the Sterling situation. Johnson jumped right into the fray and listed five demands of the NBPA. Expect to hear more from him. 4. Chris Paul . One of the world's best basketball players finds himself in the middle of the firestorm. Chris Paul serves as president of the NBPA. He also happens to play for the Los Angeles Clippers, the team owned by Sterling. Paul, 28, has been circumspect in his public comments, issuing a three-sentence statement on the NBPA website. But he did quickly ask Johnson to become involved. It would be difficult to play basketball at a time like this, but that's exactly what Paul must do. The Clippers looked out of it on Sunday in losing to the Golden State Warriors in the playoffs. Even if you don't follow basketball, you may know Paul from his Allstate insurance advertisements, in which he plays twins, one athletic and one nerdy. 5. Adam Silver . This could be a make-or-break moment for the NBA's new top dog. Silver, 52, has been the NBA commissioner for less than three months, and already he's having to deal with a problem that could shake the league to its foundations. He immediately called for an investigation into Sterling's alleged remarks and reminded the world that due process must be followed. But various forces, from Al Sharpton to the NBPA, are telling him to speed it up. The real challenge could come down the road. If the investigation finds that Sterling really said these things and he resists league discipline, the NBA's public relations problem would only deepen. A lawyer, Silver took over from David Stern, who served for three decades and oversaw tremendous growth in the sport. Silver has worked for the NBA since 1992 in various leadership jobs.

"(CNN) -- In practical terms, it might seem that the recent arrests of key Taliban members and the success of the U.S. offensive in southern Afghanistan might indicate a new phase in the war against the Taliban. But how the Taliban respond will be based on a world view and beliefs far different from the American perspective and that of the Western-educated Afghan and Pakistani elites, whom we rely on for strategic advice and partnership. On Tuesday, Pakistani authorities confirmed the capture of Mullah Abdul Kabir, a member of the Taliban's inner circle and a leading military commander against the Americans in eastern Afghanistan. Kabir's arrest by the Pakistanis closely follows that of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban's operational commander and likely second-in-command to Mullah Muhammad Omar. With the U.S. offensive based in Marjah going well, U.S. officials are privately hopeful that the latest developments will push the Taliban to the negotiating table. Could the Taliban be nearing a point where they would consider a negotiated end to the war, severing their more than decade-long alliance with Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda? Having interviewed Taliban fighters and leaders, including two who are close to Omar, it seems likely that the Taliban themselves do not know the answer to this question. In the world of Omar and the Taliban leaders, many are driven by the power of religious visions and dreams. Each ""true night dream"" is nothing less than a prophecy of God. And their leaders' authority comes from God. According to the Taliban members I interviewed over the past two years, Omar and his top followers retreated to Quetta, a Pakistani border city, after the initial American victory in Afghanistan at the end of 2001. As recounted to me, Omar was devastated by the Taliban's defeat. Paralyzed with inaction, Omar could not decide what to do, waiting patiently for a ""true night dream"" from God to tell him or at least one of his trusted followers. It was not until a Taliban deputy recounted a dream, in the spring of 2002, in which he saw Omar's ""beard turn a blinding white -- for it was now made of the threads of the holy prophet's very cloak"" that Omar decided to lead the fight again against the Americans inside Afghanistan. I was told that it was Omar's own ""true night dream"" -- where a mountain was about to fall on him when Allah appeared in the shape of a man -- that led him first to wear the holy relic of the cloak of the Prophet Mohammed. The seminal event in sealing Omar's authority as the Taliban's unquestioned leader happened when Omar donned, from a religious shrine in Kandahar, Prophet Mohammed's cloak. ""Simply by standing in the holy cloak's presence, the mute have walked out speaking, the blind seeing, but only when a true leader from God stands before it, will the holy cloak come out,"" a Taliban leader told me. In the past 100 years, the cloak only ""came out"" when the legendary King Amanullah wore it to save Afghanistan in 1929 and in efforts to stop a cholera epidemic in 1935. ""The prophet's cloak can be opened only when touched by a true leader of the faithful,"" another Taliban official told me. ""Mullah Omar had the right touch. So, Allah almighty opened the locked chests for him to wear the very cloak worn by the Prophet Mohammed, and be proclaimed leader of the faithful."" Omar's authority among his followers has continued to be based on ""true night dreams,"" or ruya, that he and those in his closest circle receive. ""And we know,"" the Taliban official told me, ""that whoever sees Allah in a dream surely has seen Him, since Satan cannot impersonate Him in a true dream."" Whether the American offensive against the Taliban is successful, we would be wrong to assume that the Taliban's actions will rationally follow battlefield realities. Omar and the Taliban leadership may be willing to negotiate with the U.S., or they may simply fight to the last man. The recent arrests of key leaders of the Taliban will undoubtedly put pressure on them. But Omar and many around him see the world in less practical terms. Ultimately, it may simply be that unless Omar has another dream that tells him to sever his alliance with bin Laden, the Taliban will remain al Qaeda's steadfast ally and never surrender or negotiate. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ken Ballen.","Ken Ballen interviewed Taliban leaders and fighters over two years .

"(CNN) -- The Archdiocese of Seattle has settled 30 claims of sexual abuse that were filed against the archdiocese and members of the Christian Brothers religious order, the archdiocese announced Tuesday. Members of the Christian Brothers were accused of sexually abusing boys at two schools the order operated: the Briscoe School, a boarding and day school for boys in the Kent Valley, beginning in 1914, and O'Dea High School from 1923, the archdiocese said. The archdiocese and lawyers for the complainants said the settlement was for $12.1 million. Some of the cases are almost 60 years old and the most recent cases are nearly 30 years old, the archdiocese said. ""I deeply regret the pain suffered by these victims,"" Archbishop J. Peter Sartain said. ""Our hope is that this settlement will bring them closure and allow them to continue the process of healing."" Lawyers for the complainants, Michael T. Pfau and Jason P. Amala, said the archdiocese and the Christian Brothers failed to protect the boys from known abusers. The lawyers said in a statement that 11 of the men were abused by a former O'Dea teacher who'd been removed from four other schools where he had abused children. The lawyers said one student's family complained about the teacher in 1974 to the school vice principal, who said the situation would be handled. However, the teacher was not removed until 1978, even though O'Dea officials kept receiving complaints from other families, the lawyers said. Pfau and Amala said they have settled more than 75 claims against the Christian Brothers and the Seattle Archdiocese for more than $35 million during the last decade.","Seattle Archdiocese settles 30 sex-abuse cases .

"(CNN) -- From the outside, Carol Coronado embraced motherhood. She played with her three girls -- ran after them, kissed them, smiled with them, a neighbor recalled. Her children seemingly had no shortage of joy, as evidenced by their own abundant laughter. ""She (said) she loved being a mother,"" Ashley Madrid said of Coronado, her neighbor. But the inside -- at least inside her Southern California home on Tuesday -- was a different story. According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Coronado is believed to have killed her children. The oldest was 3 years old, the youngest all of 2 months. Sheriff's deputies arrived at a home in unincorporated Torrance early Tuesday evening to find ""family members who told (them) that a mother had killed her children."" Inside, they found three juveniles dead and their mother ""adjacent"" to them, the sheriff's department said. Authorities told CNN affiliate KTLA the young girls were lying in a pool of blood. Their naked 30-year-old mother was holding a knife, investigators told the same station. Coronado eventually emerged from the house, wearing little more than a blanket. Madrid told Nancy Grace of CNN's sister network HLN that Coronado looked blankly at the ground. ""I could see the blood smears all over her face and arms and legs,"" Madrid recalled. ""And she was just stone-faced."" The mother was brought to a local hospital, then to the department's Carson Station to be booked on murder charges, said the sheriff's department. As of Wednesday evening, online records didn't indicate that Coronado was officially an inmate in the county, and it wasn't known whether she had a lawyer. So exactly what happened? And why? There's been no official word about a motive, nor has the sequence of events been spelled out. Madrid had known Coronado since the latter moved into the neighborhood four to five years ago. In that time, Madrid and Coronado would talk at the grocery store or across the fence about their children. Never did she hear any arguments or see any signs of trouble. ""Never,"" the neighbor said Wednesday. ""Completely opposite of what happened yesterday."" The girls' father was across the street working on a car when it happened, Madrid said.

"(CNN) -- The NFL may take over Wembley Stadium -- England's spiritual home of soccer -- every September and October but it was a racecourse that played host to one of gridiron's biggest star's Saturday as Denver Broncos Wes Welker flew in to cheer on his racehorse. A veteran of three Super Bowls, the 33-year-old wide receiver broke off from pre-season training to attend the Group One Darley July Cup at Newmarket -- an hour east of London -- even taking up bookmaker Paddy Power on a Â£5,000 ($8,560) Twitter charity bet. But there was to be no touchdown for Welker on English soil as his 25-1 shot -- named Undrafted -- ridden by jockey Frankie Dettori, finished fourth behind the winner and favorite Slade Power. Welker chose the horse's name after he missed out on the draft upon completing college. While horse racing and soccer have enjoyed a close relationship in some countries -- England internationals Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney have snapped up their own racehorses -- the bonds are less common in U.S. sport. Welker caught the racing bug through a family friend, taking a small stake in two horses in 2011 and when the opportunity arose he snapped up Undrafted. ""I really enjoy the racing and training aspect because they are very similar to football players,"" Welker told Britain's Guardian newspaper Friday. ""They have short careers, and injuries play a huge part, so how you train them and get them ready is very similar to how we train and get ready. ""It's kind of cool to see the similarities between the two athletes.""

"(CNN) -- Attorneys representing the family of Marlise Munoz -- a pregnant Texas woman they say is brain dead -- revealed Wednesday that the ""fetus is distinctly abnormal."" ""Even at this early stage, the lower extremities are deformed to the extent that the gender cannot be determined. The fetus suffers from hydrocephalus. It also appears that there are further abnormalities, including a possible heart problem, that cannot be specifically determined due to the immobile nature of Mrs. Munoz's deceased body. ""Quite sadly, this information is not surprising due to the fact that the fetus, after being deprived of oxygen for an indeterminate length of time, is gestating within a dead and deteriorating body, as a horrified family looks on in absolute anguish, distress and sadness,"" attorneys Jessica Janicek and Heather King said in a statement. Munoz's family has said she has been brain-dead since her husband, Erick Munoz, found her unconscious at their home on November 26. At the time, she was 14 weeks' pregnant with the couple's second child. Mom of pregnant woman on life support: Change the law . Munoz's husband asked a court last week to force a hospital to take her off a respirator, ventilator and other machines, saying her wishes shouldn't be disregarded just because she is pregnant. Erick Munoz filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against John Peter Smith Hospital, both with the same goal: to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial. ""Marlise Munoz is legally dead, and to further conduct surgical procedures on a deceased body is nothing short of outrageous,"" her husband says in the motion. Notably, officials at the Fort Worth, Texas, hospital where 33-year-old Marlise Munoz is have not publicly declared her dead, though they have not disputed her husband's assertions either. Woman with flu miscarries, battles for her life . A hearing in the case is set for Friday, and both the hospital and the Tarrant County district attorney's office said Wednesday they would not comment before then. Erick Munoz -- like his wife, a paramedic by training -- said the doctors told him his wife ""had lost all activity in her brain stem,"" and an accompanying chart stated she was ""brain dead,"" according to his lawsuit. Hospital spokesman J.R. Labbe said last month that doctors were simply trying to obey a Texas law that says ""you cannot withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient."" Munoz's husband responded by saying that ""Marlise cannot possibly be a pregnant patient -- Marlise is dead."" Furthermore, he argued that her wishes -- relayed, he said, in conversations but not in writing that she not be on ""life-sustaining"" measures when she is brain dead -- shouldn't be treated differently from a man or other woman simply because of her pregnancy.

"(CNN) -- Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev is set to lose half his wealth after being ordered to pay his former wife $4.5 billion in a settlement dubbed the ""most expensive divorce in history."" Elena Rybolovleva's lawyer Marc Bonnant said the order from a Geneva court was unprecedented, and ""this record judgment is a complete victory."" However, Rybolovlev's spokesman Sergey Chernitsyn said the divorce was still a ""win"" for the oligarch. The two had been battling over the settlement for six years, after Elena Rybolovleva, the oligarch's wife of 23 years, filed for divorce. Rybolovlev's total wealth is estimated at $8.8 billion, according to the 2014 Forbes list of billionaires. He made most of his money from the $6.5 billion sale of his stake in Russia's largest potassium fertilizer company in 2010. Rybolovlev is also known as the owner of the Monaco Football Club, which plays in the top French soccer league. Rybolovlev made headlines when he bought the Palm Beach Maison de L'Amitie from Donald Trump for reported $95 million in 2008. In 2012, the Rybolovlev's then 21-year-old daughter Ekaterina bought Manhattan's most expensive apartment -- the penthouse on Central Park West which cost $88 million. A trust set up in Ekaterina's name also reportedly own Scorpios, the Greek island where Jackie Kennedy married the former owner of the island, Aristotle Onassis, in 1968. The oligarch's lawyers will appeal against the decision, questioning the sum. ""There will definitely be a new appellate review and therefore this judgment is not final given the existence of two levels of appeal in Switzerland,"" said Tetiana Bersheda, Rybolovlev's lawyer.

"(CNN) -- The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank needed a way to tell the world about its work. Shawn Ahmed wanted to continue the video storytelling he'd begun on behalf of the poor in Bangladesh. YouTube wanted to bring them together. The result, YouTube's Video Volunteers page, pairs deserving but underfunded charities with creative video producers willing to help them. The page has brought hundreds of sometimes-offbeat fundraising and promotional videos to the same site that launched such Web celebrities as singer Susan Boyle and the ""Leave Britney Alone"" guy. ""There are all these really big, sexy parts of YouTube, but we need people to know about this [project] because it actually matters,"" said YouTube spokesman Aaron Zamost, invoking pop star Justin Timberlake. ""The nonprofits aren't that sexy -- but we're trying to bring sexy back a little bit to the nonprofits."" The Video Volunteers page lets nonprofits post descriptions of projects for which they need videos produced. Video artists, in turn, can scroll the offerings and pick a cause they'd like to help. Since October, the site has featured a particular issue each month. February's issue is health. The best videos get featured on YouTube's main page, giving massive exposure to both the charity and the video artist. ""We would love to think users just do it out of the kindness of their own hearts,"" said Ramya Raghavan, the nonprofits and activism manager at YouTube, who said she thinks that's usually the case. ""But I think the incentive piece does help a lot."" On average, about 75 new volunteer videos appear on the page each month. During ""animal welfare month"" in October, 120 new videos were created, Raghavan said. Last year, Ahmed, who had already visited Bangladesh to video blog and raise funds for poverty relief there through his personal project, Uncultured, was looking for a way to address the issue closer to home. He found out about the Los Angeles, California, food bank through YouTube and the charity's parent organization, Feeding America. ""It was just really serendipity,"" said Ahmed, who lives in Toronto, Canada. ""I wanted to do something charitable at home and YouTube had made a relationship with Feeding America. This actually made things really, really easy for me."" The food bank is one of the nation's largest and distributes about 1 million pounds of food a week. Its staffers were thrilled at the prospect. Spokeswoman Julie Flynn said the staff recognized the value of an online video presence, but never had the time or money to seriously pursue it. ""We're just trying to maintain our own Web site,"" she said. ""It was really nice to have someone volunteer, and a cool way for [Ahmed] to get involved. It was a perfect blend of his passion, his skills and our need."" The resulting video shows Ahmed touring the bank's distribution center on a forklift, interviewing clients and, ultimately, showing the 10,000 pounds of food he was able to provide with a $2,000 donation he'd raised online. It appeared on YouTube's main page on Thanksgiving Day, and had gotten more than 400,000 page views as of this week. The key to success on YouTube, Ahmed said, is realizing that the site's viewers are different than a television audience and that traditional public-service announcements aren't going to cut it. ""When people watch videos on YouTube, they don't approach it the same way as when they watch CNN or 'Heroes,' "" he said. ""It's very personal interaction for them. I just wanted to take a personal approach ... I thought if I do it this way, people would get more involved."" Many of the clips are quirky, unconventional and self-referencing -- taking their cues from some of the most viral videos on the site.

"(CNN) -- What's a man to do after helming two of the most lucrative film releases to date (and re-releasing one in 3-D)? Ride a one-man submersible to the deepest known point in the world's oceans, before attempting to expand the Earth's resource base by backing a new space venture. Obviously. James Cameron, known for writing and directing films like ""The Terminator,"" ""Aliens, ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar,"" has made headlines recently for some science (non)fiction projects that won't be appearing on the big screen. Last month the filmmaker plunged more than 35,800 feet to the Mariana Trench, where he collected samples that will allow scientists to conduct research about the habitat. And now he's apparently involved with Planetary Resources, along with several other distinguished investors. ""[Cameron] has more money than you could spend in 100 lifetimes, a lovely wife and family, a huge compound ... a lot of Oscars,"" said Howard Bragman, a longtime Hollywood publicist and the vice chairman of Reputation.com. ""[He's] made the two biggest movies in the entire world. After that, it kind of becomes about your dreams. It's wonderful that somebody with these resources follows their dreams."" Wealthy celebrities like Cameron have the resources to boldly go where other people have only imagined. But there's more to living out such dreams than a bottomless bank account. ""(Cameron) has the infrastructure to carry this out,"" Bragman told CNN. ""Same as someone like (Sir Richard) Branson. We're not just talking about money here."" Branson, the business tycoon behind the Virgin Group, has used his notoriety and wealth to break several world records and purchase land (including a small island in the British Virgin Islands), in addition to his many humanitarian initiatives. Oprah Winfrey is another celebrity who has been fortunate enough to follow her dreams. She opened The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in 2007. Winfrey visited South Africa in January to congratulate the school's first graduates. There are plenty of people with money who wouldn't be able to accomplish everything these celebs have accomplished or live out their dreams like Cameron has, Bragman said. ""Both (Cameron and Branson) are in industries that generate a lot of press,"" Bragman said. ""They're both incredibly successful. If some Russian billionaire did it, it wouldn't get the same attention. But when James Cameron does it, it's fascinating. It's a journey. And it might turn into a TV show. ... Knowing him, he'll probably figure out a way to make money off [his underwater exploration]. That's what a great businessman does."" ""The thing about James Cameron is, he can get his mind around a project the size of 'Avatar' and keep his cool,"" Roger Ebert wrote in 2009. ""If it requires the development of untested technology, he takes the time to work on it. If he wants to create aliens human enough to be sexy and yet keep them out of the Uncanny Valley (the repulsion humans feel when robots look a little too realistic), he test-drives them."" Cameron is somehow able to create worlds that don't exist, and explain real events in a way that no one else can, Bragman said. His curiosity and his unlimited resources allow him to do this. ""And good for him and good for us who get to share in it,"" he added. ""We're seeing places we've never seen before [because of him]"" -- both on and off screen.","Cameron is the filmmaker behind ""The Terminator,"" ""Aliens, ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Three more officials have been given the chop as part of China's anti-corruption drive. The disgraced politicians are the latest in a string of purges of former aides to Zhou Yongkang, China's retired chief of domestic security, fueling speculation that Zhou will eventually face charges. Ji Wenlin, former deputy governor of Hainan, and Yu Gang, former senior official in the Politics and Legal Affairs Commission, have both been expelled from the Communist Party for taking ""huge bribes"" and committing adultery, announced the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) on Wednesday. Adultery, while not illegal in China, is considered a serious violation of Party regulations. The third official charged with corruption is Tan Hong, a former senior officer in the Ministry of Public Security. All three have close ties to Zhou, working under the security czar at some point during their careers. Zhou was a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body, until he retired in 2012. He was considered one of the most powerful men in China, serving as the head of China's security and police institutions. Rumors surrounding Zhou's downfall have been circulating on China's social media for two years, gaining momentum in recent months as high-profile corruption probes have led to the detention of senior officials linked to him throughout his career. Zhou would become the highest-ranking official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic. But there has been no official announcement of an investigation into Zhou. Reuters has reported sources saying Zhou is now under house arrest. China's anti-corruption campaign catches another 'tiger' Netted 'tigers' In 2013, some 182,000 officials were disciplined while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases, according to the CCDI. After coming into power in late 2012, President Xi Jinping banned official extravagance -- from banquets to year-end gifts -- and vowed to target ""tigers and flies"" alike in his fight against corruption when describing his resolve to spare no one regardless of their position. On Monday, one of the biggest ""tigers"" met his downfall: Xu Caihou, former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission that runs the world's largest standing army, and a former Politburo member, was found to have accepted bribes. Longtime China observers, however, point to the limits of President Xi's war on corruption. ""Corruption is so widespread and so endemic that campaigns are just not going do it,"" said Frank Ching, a Hong Kong-based commentator and columnist on Chinese politics. ""Something has to be done about the system."" ""There have been public calls for a law to require officials disclosing their assets. There has been no indication that they are going to do that. In fact, a number of people calling for this law have ended up in prison,"" he added. ""I think people will be much more convinced of the seriousness of this anti-corruption campaign if there were a move to enact such a law."" CNN's Steven Jiang and Jaime FlorCruz contributed to this article.","Ji Wenlin, Yu Gang, Tan Hong have ties to powerful former head of domestic security, Zhou Yongkang .

"(CNN) -- At least 40 members of a religious minority in Myanmar were killed by security forces and Buddhists in the western village of Du Char Yar Tan last week, a human rights group said. Fortify Rights, a group based in Southeast Asia, claims the attacks against the Rohingya Muslims were carried out after the suspected killing of a police officer, who is still missing. Most of dead were women and children, the group said. But the government denies the killings, and Myanmar's deputy minister of information told reporters that the news outlets reporting them are ""wholly and totally wrong."" In a statement, the government outlined the details of an incident that led to the missing police officer at the center of the latest clashes. It apparently started January 13 when a police patrol led by the missing officer encountered a group of men described in the report as Bengalis ""sitting around a fire in front of shops."" The group apparently started throwing stones at the patrol and was joined shortly after by about 100 villagers with knives and sticks, according to the report. The officers fled, except for police Sgt. Aung Kyaw Thein, who has been missing since. Riot police have moved into the village, and journalists and human rights activists have been denied access, according to Fortify Rights. ""When the police went into the village to find the missing police, almost all the men had fled, leaving women, children and old people,"" a police spokesman told CNN. He said there are so many security forces now looking for the missing police officer that violence between Muslims and Buddhists is no longer possible. Valerie Amos, United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, warned of ""alarming levels of violence, including the killing of many civilians and a policeman."" She called on Myanmar's government to launch an impartial investigation into the claims. The U.N. calls the Rohingya Muslims one of the most persecuted populations in the world, and 3,500 of them live in the village of Du Char Yar Tan. They've been the frequent targets of violence by Buddhists, who are the majority in Myanmar. U.S. President Barack Obama urged Myanmar's President Thein Sein during a visit to the White House last year to respect the rights of the Rohingya minority.","Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar were killed by security forces, Buddhists, rights group says .

"(CNN) -- Authorities asked people to evacuate 1,000 structures near a wildfire in Alaska's Kenai National Wildlife Refuge on Sunday as the blaze spread. The Funny River Fire has been raging for almost a week in Soldotna, south of Anchorage, growing to engulf 140,000 acres by Sunday afternoon. Now, fire officials are worried recreational cabins and second homes where residents and retirees are spending the holiday weekend may be at risk, said Michelle Weston with the Alaska Interagency Incident Management Team. The voluntary evacuation notice was issued for structures near the blaze on Sunday, Weston said. So far, no structures have burned in the fire. Earlier Sunday, emergency officials said windy weather was pushing the fire further into the refuge and away from homes. Investigators said they suspect human action was the cause, but authorities were still investigating. The containment was at 20% with 450 personnel fighting the blaze. The Air National Guard sent two helicopters to assist with water drops, in addition to the four helicopters performing aerial firefighting.","Authorities have issued a voluntary evacuation notice for 1,000 structures .

"(CNN) -- If the attorney general of Mississippi had had his way, Michelle Byrom would have been executed Thursday for allegedly hiring someone to kill her husband, Edward Byrom Sr. Michelle Byrom, who has suffered a lifetime of abuse -- first at the hands of her stepfather and later at the hands of her husband -- also struggles with mental illness. On the night of June 4, 1999, when her husband was killed, Byrom was in the hospital. At her trial, jurors bought the prosecution's version of the crime and found her guilty of murder for hire. Defense attorneys did not call the alleged killer to testify on her behalf, nor did the defense present the son's multiple confessions. Judge Thomas Gardner imposed a death sentence. Now, evidence is coming to light revealing that it was the son, Edward Byrom, Jr. -- aka Junior -- who killed his father and that Gardner knew of the son's confession before the trial, but on a technicality, the jury wasn't permitted to see his jailhouse confession letters. No wonder, with such exculpatory information withheld, Michelle Byrom was found guilty and received a death sentence. As is often the case in these harrowing tales of justice, only now, 14 years after the trial, have dedicated post-conviction lawyers' investigations shed light on the son's confessions. In letters to his mother, Junior wrote in stark detail how he killed his father and why. He also confessed to forensic psychologist Criss Lott in the course of a pretrial interview. Those confessions are corroborated by the fact that it was Junior who led police to the murder weapon and that it was his hands that tested positive for traces of gunpowder. In one of his admissions to his mother, Junior wrote: . ""I sit in my room, for a good 1 Â½ - 2 hours and dad comes in my room and goes off on me, calling me bastard, nogood, mistake, and telling me I'm inconciderate (sic) and just care about my self, and slaps me, then goes back to his room. As I sat on my bed, tears of rage flowing, remembering my childhood, my anger kept building and building, and I went to my car, got the 9mm, and walked to his room, peeked in, and he was asleep. I walked about two steps in the door, and screamed, and shut my eyes, when I heard him move, I started firing. When I opened my eyes again, I freaked! I grabbed what casings I saw, and threw them into the bushes, grabbed the gun, and went to town."" Junior's letters were barred at the trial. Gardner precluded the jury from hearing them as a sanction against Byrom's lawyers, who failed to share them with the prosecution in a timely manner. What the jury did hear was the prosecutor's scenario that Junior was part of a murder-for-hire conspiracy, with his mother as mastermind and his friend Joey Gillis as the shooter. In a deal with prosecutors for a reduced sentence, Junior testified against his mother. What Junior said to a sheriff when he was interrogated cannot be verified. County authorities say the recording was lost. But in a letter, Junior said: . ""I gave them (the sheriffs) one bulls**t story after another, trying to save my own ass. ... I was so scared, confused, and high, I just started spitting the first thought out, which turned into this big conspiracy thing, for money, which was all BS, that's why I had so many different stories."" As evidence now shows, Gardner also knew of Junior's confession of guilt to psychologist Lott even before the trial. Driven by conscience, Lott had told the judge what Junior had voluntarily revealed to him, but the judge did not disclose this to the jury and went so far as to instruct Lott not to share the information with the defense. When the defense took the unusual step of asking the judge, instead of the jury, to pass sentence, Judge Gardner chose death. This week the Mississippi Supreme Court denied the state attorney general's motion to set Thursday as an execution date for Ms. Byrom. The big question now is whether the Mississippi Supreme Court will grant Byrom's request for a hearing to consider the newly revealed evidence, including Lott's affidavit stating that he told the trial judge about Junior's confession. I'm holding my breath. I know all too well what happens in such successor petitions in some higher courts. In my book ""The Death of Innocents,"" I tell of two men in Virginia and Louisiana denied hearings on new evidence of innocence because the higher court held their petitions to be ""procedurally barred"" or because Southern supreme courts, almost as a matter of course, uphold prosecutors' positions on death cases. Those two men were executed, and I accompanied them to their deaths. I hope and pray that Byrom, a victim of both physical and constitutional abuses, fares better.

"(CNN) -- Each year, bright, optimistic Africans leave home to earn an education or seek a better economic life abroad for themselves and their families. With fewer opportunities in their home country, many never return home. The African Diaspora is broadly defined by the African Union Commission as ""peoples of African origin living outside the continent, irrespective of their citizenship and nationality and who are willing to contribute to the development of the continent and the building of the African Union."" Globally, Africans in the diaspora are spread out across the continents. In North America, there are 39 million from the African Diaspora; 113 million in Latin America; 13.6 million in the Caribbean; and 3.5 million in Europe, the World Bank estimates. The African Diaspora is not a monolithic group -- some were born and reared outside of their home country; many migrated to Europe, the United States and other parts of the world at a young age; while others arrived to attend college. No matter how they arrived in their adopted country, diasporans bring a distinct perspective to the discourse on Africa because they have experienced both worlds and can serve as a bridge in fostering greater understanding between the continent and their adopted country. Read this: Africa's most exciting photographers . My personal story is that I have lived most of my life as an African diasporan. I was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Yet, in my father's pursuit to attain a higher education and better career opportunities, my family moved to Japan, the United States, and then Liberia. I returned to the United States for my undergraduate and post-graduate degrees, and remained in the States to build my career. We live in an interconnected world. My life embodies this interconnection. I love my adopted country of America and all that it has to offer; and Africa is where my roots are and where my heart and passion live. With this duality, I try to marry these worlds the best way that I can in my daily life. The organization that I lead, The Africa-America Institute (AAI) has served as a bridge between continents for 60 years. As African nations were gaining independence from colonial rule in 1953, AAI was founded to build human capacity on the continent by providing opportunities for African students to pursue academic degrees at top universities in the United States. After receiving their degrees, more than 90% of our alumni returned home to become leaders in the public, non-profit, and private sectors in Africa, where they contributed to strengthening the foundation for African development. Read this: 'New wind of change is blowing through Africa' With 23,000 AAI alumni worldwide, we proudly count prominent alumni such as Wangari Maathai, the late Kenyan environmental and women's rights activist and Nobel Laureate; Prime Minister H.E. Nahas Angula of Namibia; and President Joyce Banda of Malawi, among other distinguished African leaders. Today, AAI offers rigorous professional development and leadership training programs through our African partner institutions to women and men who exhibit talent and leadership in key fields -- and who display a deep commitment to advancing to Africa's development. Indeed, Africans in the diaspora have so much to offer the continent, boosting one of the world's fastest-growing economic regions -- six of the 10 fastest growing markets in the world are in sub-Saharan Africa. By leveraging the skills, ingenuity and resources that the African Diaspora possesses, diasporans are uniquely positioned to contribute to boosting economic growth and prosperity in Africa. Firstly, diasporans can help dispel myths and stereotypes about Africa to change the narrative about the continent. All diasporans can serve as ""brand ambassadors"" to bring a new vision and inspiring ideas for Africa. By and large, the three ""Ds"" about Africa -- death, despair and disease -- still prevail in the minds of many people in the Western world. African diasporans, especially young people, can become the face of a ""new Africa"" -- educated, optimistic, and actively working to transform and shape Africa's future. Secondly, diasporans can help shape foreign policy. Since many in the African Diaspora still maintain strong connections to the continent, diasporans can help influence foreign policy priorities by offering informative analysis of on-the-ground realities in African nations and sharing under-reported success stories of progress taking place, as well as solutions to development challenges. Lastly, diasporans can bring their talent, energy, skills and technological know-how to furthering economic progress in Africa. Many Africans in the diaspora want to eventually go back home after living abroad. However, one of their biggest challenges is finding suitable employment once they return. The demand for talent is high in Africa, yet the wide skills gap is a sobering reality. A McKinsey Global Institute Report estimates that 122 million people will be added to Africa's labor force between 2010 and 2020, creating a burgeoning labor force of more than 500 million across the continent. Skilled professionals from the African Diaspora are recognizing the tremendous opportunities that exist in Africa and are repatriating home in greater numbers to fill top positions at multinational corporations and organizations on the continent. They are also investing in Africa's emerging markets and launching African-led businesses and enterprises to create well-needed jobs and spur economic growth. Harnessing the talents and expertise of the African Diaspora can help to bolster Africa's workforce development. Recognizing this tremendous asset, AAI hosted a Talent Summit where mid-career professionals from the diaspora learned about the challenges and opportunities of launching a career in Africa or at leading Africa-focused organizations in the United States. Attendees left the summit armed with information to plan a possible career transition. Mobilizing the full participation of Africans in the diaspora is a win-win for Africa, and can foster stronger connections between continents to accelerate Africa's social and economic development. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amini Kajunju.","African Diaspora can boost continent's prosperity, says Amini Kajunju .

"(CNN) -- Efforts to curb overfishing in five of the world's marine ecosystems are starting to show signs of working. Many fisheries around the world are dangerously close to collapsing. The news comes from a multi-national study on the status of marine fisheries and ecosystems reported in ""Science"". While the report found that stock collapse is an increasing international trend, the scientists involved believe there are positive signs that rebuilding the ocean's depleted fish stocks is possible. The two year study looked at ten marine ecosystems, evaluating how much marine life was being fished and which management techniques have been used to rebuild depleted stocks. It is a follow-up to a 2006 paper that highlighted a widespread global trend toward fisheries collapse that led to disagreement among the scientific community. The study found signs of some stock recovery in waters around the U.S., Iceland and New Zealand, supporting the argument that well managed fishing can lead to rebuilding fisheries in other parts of the world. ""These highly managed ecosystems are improving"" said Ray Hilborn of the University of Washington and one of the report's lead authors. ""Yet there is still a long way to go: of all fish stocks that we examined sixty-three percent remained below target and still needed to be rebuilt."" ""Across all regions we are still seeing a troubling trend of increasing stock collapse,"" said Boris Worm, of Dalhousie University and co-author of the report. ""But this paper shows that our oceans are not a lost cause. The encouraging result is that exploitation rate -- the ultimate driver of depletion and collapse -- is decreasing in half of the ten systems we examined in detail. This means that management in those areas is setting the stage for ecological and economic recovery. It's only a start, but it gives me hope that we have the ability to bring overfishing under control."" Most of the marine ecosystems studied were in intensive managed areas in developed countries where the scientists were able to collect regular data. However, the report also found that often overfishing would move to areas with weaker laws and enforcement. While most of the fisheries that showed improvement are managed by a few wealthy nations, there are some exceptions. In Kenya, scientists, managers, and local communities teamed up to close some key areas to fishing and restrict certain types of fishing gear. According to the study, this led to an increase in the size and amount of fish available -- and an increase in fishers' incomes. ""These successes are local - but they are inspiring others to follow suit,"" says Tim McClanahan of the Wildlife Conservation Society in Kenya. ""We know that more fish can be harvested with less fishing effort and less impact on the environment, if we first slow down and allow over-fished populations to rebuild,"" said Jeremy Collie from the University of Rhode Island, another author of the report. ""Scientists and managers in places as different as Iceland and Kenya have been able to reduce overfishing and rebuild fish populations despite serious challenges."" While the study suggests that closing areas to fishing, banning some types of fishing gear and changing fishing quotas have long-term benefits, they also come with short-term costs to fishers. ""Some places have chosen to end overfishing,"" said Trevor Branch from the University of Washington in the report. ""That choice can be painful for fishermen in the short term, but in the long term it benefits fish, fishermen, and our ocean ecosystems as a whole."" However, ""lessons from one spot need to be applied very carefully to a new area,"" said co-author Beth Fulton of the CSIRO Wealth from Oceans Flagship in Australia, since ""there are no single silver bullet solutions. Management efforts must be customized to the place and the people.""","Methods available to meet fishing needs and conservation, report suggests .
General trend is towards overfishing, but rates in some areas slowing .

"(CNN) -- Gilad Shalit was a 19-year-old enlisted man guarding an Israeli army post when Palestinian militants attacked his tank, killed the two men he was serving with and took him prisoner more than five years ago. Israelis are overjoyed that he went free on Tuesday in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. ""We have experienced the rebirth of a son,"" Shalit's father said. It has been ""an exhausting and long struggle."" ""Our eyes are wet and our hearts are proud,"" Israeli President Shimon Peres declared. ""We have become ourselves again."" ""He really is the child of us all,"" said Daniel Taub, Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom, noting that almost all Israelis do military service. Shalit told Egypt's state-owned Nile TV after his release Tuesday that it was ""exciting"" to meet many of the people who ""have worked very hard in order to release me. I would like to thank them for all this effort."" He said he received the news of a possible deal to free him a week ago, ""but I felt it for the last month. ... I was afraid that the negotiations could go wrong."" Much of Israel came to a halt in a nationwide demonstration earlier this year in response to a Facebook campaign that went viral. On March 15, cars pulled to the side of the road, schools halted classes and Israeli President Shimon Peres paused at a conference in the southern Israeli city of Eilat. Israelis were not the only ones marking the soldier's captivity. ""Jews across the world have been pining for Gilad Shalit's release for over five years,"" said William Daroff, a vice president of the Jewish Federations of North America. ""Thousands of us have had an empty chair at our Passover seder tables reserved for Gilad,"" he said, referring to the celebratory meal that marks the beginning of Passover. ""We have prayed for his release. We have met with his parents, we have sat with his family in their tent outside the prime minister's residence, we have marched for Gilad's release."" Shalit's parents led a 12-day march from their home in northern Israel to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem in June 2010 and camped out in a tent there until last week. Soon after the protest camp was set up, the British government demanded Shalit's ""immediate and unconditional release."" ""His detention is unjustifiable and unacceptable,"" the British Foreign Office said on Shalit's 24th birthday. In June of this year, the United States condemned Shalit's captivity ""in the strongest possible terms,"" according to a White House statement. America ""joins other governments and organizations around the world"" in calling for his immediate freedom, the statement said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Tuesday his thoughts were with the victims' families of the Palestinian prisoners released under the terms of the deal. ""Gilad could not pay for everybody,"" Sarkozy said. Asked what he missed most during his captivity, Shalit told Nile TV Tuesday he missed his family. ""I missed going out and meeting people,"" he said.' Shalit traveled via Egypt because it acted as a mediator between Israel and Hamas. Asked why he thought the Egyptians succeeded and others did not, he said, ""I think the Egyptians were successful because they have good relations with Hamas and with Israel."" On whether he will help bring about the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, Shalit said, ""I will be glad if they are released, as long as they do not return to fighting Israel."" And he said he hopes the deal that brought about his release ""will move the peace process forward."" Shalit was born August 28, 1986, in the Israeli coastal city of Naharia and moved with his family to western Galilee two years later. He has two brothers and was an outstanding science student in high school, his family says. An Israeli military operation immediately after his capture failed to free him, and he was held incommunicado throughout his captivity. His family calls it a violation of international law that organizations such as the Red Cross were not allowed to see him and that they were only able to get one letter to him. The last proof he was alive came in a video in 2009 in which the noticeably thin young man held a newspaper dated September 14. In the video, he talks about his family, saying: ""I miss them very much, and I am longing for the day when I will see them again."" The day after his capture, a trio of Palestinian groups, including members of Hamas, Fatah and Islamic Jihad, said they would release him in exchange for all female Palestinian prisoners and all security prisoners under the age of 18 held by Israel, the Shalit family said. In the end, Israel is releasing significantly more than the Palestinians originally demanded -- despite the objections of at least some Israeli families who do not want to see the killers of their relatives released. The Israeli public overwhelmingly supports the agreement to release more than 1,000 prisoners in exchange for Shalit, according to a poll published in the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth the day before his handover by Hamas to Egyptian security. Israel's ambassador to London summed up the mixed feelings many experienced in his country as they waited for their most famous captive to taste freedom. ""Seeing Gilad coming home ... is really coming home to every family. But at the same time it's very bittersweet,"" Taub said, since ""every one of us in some way has been touched by terrorism.""

"(CNN) -- Disturbing and graphic images have emerged on Facebook that appear to show a Filipino maid with burns all over her back, arms and legs after her Saudi boss's mother allegedly poured boiling water on her. The 23-year-old woman, Pahima Alagai Palacasi, was at the home of her employer's mother on May 4 when ""her sponsor's mother poured boiled water over Palacasi due to a simple misunderstanding,"" according to a Philippines Labor Ministry statement posted Tuesday. While at hospital, Palacasi was able to reach a relative who lives in Riyadh who helped her sneak out of hospital. The cousin then posted graphic photos of Palacasi's wounds on Facebook, showing bright pink and white scalded skin all over her back, the backs of her arms, and parts of her leg, according to the ministry statement. The Philippines government said it would help Palacasi file a case against her employer and has suspended the work of the Saudi recruitment agency that hired her. The English-language Saudi daily Arab News reported Wednesday that Riyadh police were conducting a joint investigation of the case. Palacasi alleges that her employer began physically abusing her within days of her arrival, kicking and lashing her after she complained of being homesick. She also claimed her employers deprived her of food. ""[My employer's mother] asked me to throw away all the leftover food but I didn't do it so that when I got hungry I could have something to eat,"" Palacasi said in a cellphone video reportedly taken by her cousin and released to ABS-CBN, a CNN affiliate in the Philippines. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video. ""Please help me,"" Palacasi says in the video. ""Help me file a case against my employer. I suffered a lot."" Palacsi is currently at an embassy shelter in Riyadh. ""She is stable, in high spirits, and is relating well with fellow [Filipino workers]"" according to the government statement. CNN has been unable to reach Palacasi or her cousin. Saudi authorities told CNN they were unaware of details of the case, but would look into the matter.

"(CNN) -- Whether or not Netflix orders more episodes of ""Arrested Development,"" the streaming service will remain in business with the show's creator, Mitch Hurwitz. Netflix announced a deal Tuesday to have Hurwitz come up with new shows, which means another oddball comedy might be on the way. It was described as a multiyear deal. Netflix has commissioned a number of original shows before, including ""Orange is the New Black"" and ""Hemlock Grove."" But until now, it has not struck what Hollywood studios sometimes call ""writer-producer deals"" with individual creators. A Netflix spokeswoman confirmed that the arrangement with Hurwitz is a first for the company. The deal comes nearly a year after Netflix resurrected ""Arrested,"" a comedy series that the Fox network had canceled several years earlier. Netflix ordered a 15-episode fourth season, executive-produced by Hurwitz, and premiered them all at once in May 2013. Since then, there's been speculation about whether Netflix will order a fifth season or help finance the long-talked-about ""Arrested Development"" movie. The company said nothing about that on Tuesday. Its news release said Hurwitz would ""produce, develop and create new original series for Netflix."" Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, called Hurwitz ""a true genius with one of the most distinctive voices in comedy today."" And Hurwitz returned the praise, calling it ""incredibly inspiring to get to produce for Netflix, a company that not only doesn't resist change, but is leaps and bounds ahead of everyone in forging it."" Hurwitz concluded his statement with a joke: ""The fact that I'm also getting one month of their streaming right to my TV or Xbox free ... well, it really takes the sting out of buying that Xbox.""","Netflix signs a multiyear deal with Mitch Hurwitz .

"(CNN) -- Accompanied by unusually cold temperatures, snow fell late Saturday from Minnesota east to Virginia, prompting a series of warnings but few major headaches. One major storm system affected communities from Chicago, Illinois, to Raleigh, North Carolina, as many residents spent the first part of their weekend dealing with the first significant snow of the season. Throughout the East Coast, temperatures averaged about 5 to 15 degrees colder than normal, with freeze watches in effect as far south as Florida. By 7:15 p.m., just over 5 inches of snow had fallen at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, breaking the 1964 record for December 4 of 4.6 inches. A winter weather advisory remained in effect in the Windy City through midnight. More than 300 flights were canceled in and out of Chicago Saturday morning, the Chicago Department of Aviation said. The situation improved gradually over the course of the day, though O'Hare was still experiencing ground traffic delays -- for the planes that touch down, but are slower getting to their gates -- ranging from 16 to 30 minutes by early evening. The timing of the storm -- coming after the Friday evening rush hour, with most snow falling while people slept -- and the fact snow didn't stick to most major roads helped keep auto accidents minimal. ""It's Chicago, it's great,"" resident Casey Gorski told CNN affiliate WLS. ""I've got no qualms about (the snow) at all."" The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning through 7 a.m. ET Sunday for Appalachian regions of northwest North Carolina, southwest Virginia and southeast West Virginia. While the accumulating snow was expected to be fairly minor, forecasters warned of icy roads and winds gusting as strong as 45 mph. In addition, expected light snow prompted the agency to issue a winter weather advisory -- effective until 1 a.m. ET -- for parts of southern and central Virgina as well as northeast North Carolina. Residents of southern and eastern Minnesota and Wisconsin already saw considerable snow. A foot fell in Hutchinson, Minnesota, about double that in Minneapolis some 60 miles to the east, according to the National Weather Service. Madison, Wisconsin, got between 3 and 5 inches of snow Saturday, and some snow also fell in the southwest Ohio city of Cincinnati. Indianapolis also was in the storm's path. The National Weather Service reported 3 inches had fallen and it predicted flurries in the city through Tuesday. The most snow in Indiana -- 7 inches -- accumulated 70 miles to the west in Clinton. Other cities in Indiana and Michigan are expected to be hit hard by snow in the coming days. Five to 10 inches of lake-effect snow were forecast for Valparaiso, Indiana, located about 50 miles southeast of Chicago, with Gary, Indiana, also feeling the storm's effect. Other more eastern communities along Lake Michigan -- such as Michigan City, Indiana, and St. Joseph and Buchanan across the border in Michigan -- may get as much as 20 inches of snow by daybreak Tuesday. The National Weather Service has issued a warning for lake-effect snow for many of these areas from 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Tuesday, predicting snow might fall at a rate of 1 to 3 inches an hour. Earlier this week, the Buffalo, New York, area, was being buried by such sustained lake-effect snow. That Wednesday through Friday storm dumped up to 3 feet of snow in a narrow band centered in Lancaster -- though locations as little as 12 miles away only got 6 to 12 inches, if not less. Forecasters are also predicting more snow this week in the region.","NEW: A winter storm warning is out for parts of North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia .

"(CNN) -- Toyota's recent recall of millions of vehicles for sticking accelerator pedals may get drivers wondering: What should you do if a vehicle is accelerating uncontrollably? Accelerator pedals in the 2.3 million vehicles that Toyota recalled may, in rare circumstances, become stuck after the pedal mechanisms become worn, the automaker has said. Toyota says it is shipping reinforcement parts to dealers, and that dealers will start repairs as soon as this weekend. The U.S. Transportation Department urges owners of the recalled vehicles to arrange fixes as soon as possible, though Toyota says the sticking problem is rare and happens gradually, and if no sticking is noticed in a vehicle, it should be safe to drive. If the pedal starts to feel sticky but isn't yet stuck, stop driving and call a dealer to arrange for your vehicle to be picked up, Toyota says. But if the pedal is stuck in a depressed position, here is what the driver can do, according to Omar Panjshiri, a certified Toyota technician at the Chantilly Repair Center in Chantilly, Virginia: . • Shift the transmission to neutral . • Turn off the ignition switch . • Apply the brakes and pull over . With the engine cut off, ""you will lose some power steering assist, but you will still be able to steer the vehicle to a safe stopping position,"" Panjshiri said. Full coverage: Toyota recall . Some 2009 and 2010 vehicles involved in the recall have buttons for the ignition, rather than keys. In this case, to cut power to the engine, push the button and hold it for more than three seconds, Panjshiri said. ""[Otherwise,] you'll do the same exact thing: Shift ... [from] drive position to neutral, and steer the vehicle safely to a shoulder to come to a complete stop,"" he said. Vehicles in the recall are: Toyota's 2009-2010 RAV4, Corolla and Matrix; 2005-2010 Avalon; certain 2007-2010 Camrys; 2010 Highlander; 2007-2010 Tundra; and the 2008-2010 Sequoia. The Camry Hybrid is not included. CNN's Brian Todd and CNNMoney.com's Peter Valdes-Dapena contributed to this report.","Technician: If accelerator pedal is stuck, shift to neutral and cut ignition .

"(CNN) -- If you want to see the impact of Iran's growing power in the Middle East, look no further than Syria. On Monday, three important developments occurred simultaneously: . First, world diplomats scrambled anxiously to salvage plans for a conference on Syria scheduled to start on Wednesday. The ""Geneva II"" meeting almost went off the rails before it began, with Syrian opposition leaders threatening to stay away unless the United Nations retracted the invitation it had unexpectedly extended to Iran. At the same time, a new report about the Syrian civil war showed what appears to be convincing evidence of large-scale ""systematic torture and killing"" by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iran's top ally. The report's authors said the new evidence could prove al-Assad and his regime are guilty of perpetrating crimes against humanity. And in the third major event of that day, the interim nuclear deal between Iran and world powers went into effect. Under the deal negotiated in November, Iran suspended some of its nuclear enrichment operations, and Western governments started lifting some of the economic sanctions they have used to pressure Tehran. Opinion: Syrian genocide needs justice . These three events will be included by historians and analysts when they write the story of the turmoil of the early 21st century Middle East. They will note that this was a week that showed the consequences of Iran's gradually rising influence, as the Islamic Republic moved steadily toward its goal of becoming the dominant power in the region. Not long ago, the dictator al-Assad appeared on the verge of losing power to a popular uprising. President Barack Obama declared he ""must get out of the way."" But his regime's loyal allies in Tehran sent in reinforcements. At the urging of its Iranian patrons, Lebanon's Shiite militia, Hezbollah, moved its forces across the border into Syria, helping to turn the tide of the war and adding to its increasing radicalization. The war went from a grassroots democratic movement to a brutal showdown between Sunni extremists -- whose strongest elements now include al Qaeda fighters -- against Shiite forces loyal to Iran and al-Assad. Now the Syrian war, which has displaced millions of civilians and has killed more than 130,000, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, is spilling into Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere. It has become a proxy war for regional rivalries, with Sunni states, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, supporting the opposition, and Iran, along with Hezbollah, standing steadfastly with al-Assad by providing him with manpower, ammunition and intelligence. Iran has not only saved al-Assad, it has changed the character of the fight. It has turned it into a much more dangerous regional conflict, all but eliminating the prospects for a positive outcome anytime soon and adding to the indescribable suffering of the Syrian people. Where do Iran's nuclear program and the agreement with world powers fit into all this? The interim deal was meant to freeze the nuclear program in place for six months while a final agreement is negotiated. But the announcement of the deal late last year immediately transformed the landscape. In the eyes of Arab states, the U.S. was taking the first steps towards capitulating before Iran's aspirations. The Iranian regime's goal is to spread its version of Islamic revolution and to make Iran the most powerful country in the region. The sight of top American and European diplomats rushing to Geneva to negotiate with Iran sent a strong message. Within days, the balance of power started shifting. Countless delegations crossed the Persian Gulf, as Arab rulers allied with Washington sought to strengthen ties with Tehran. Saudi Arabian officials railed against the United States. One reason Iran signed the interim deal is that it has already achieved a great deal of what it sought with its nuclear program. Under the so-called Joint Action Plan, Iran has suspended uranium enrichment above 5% and will start getting rid of its 20%-enriched uranium, which is close to weapons grade. But nobody thinks the deal, as it stands now, is a solution. In some respects, Iran is already a nuclear power, although it doesn't yet have the full immunity that nuclear weapons would create. As if to reinforce that point, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Abbas Araghchi, told Iranian television that if Tehran decided to resume enrichment to its previous levels, it could do it in 24 hours. The White House dismissed the statement as meant for domestic consumption. But the fact is that Iran is not dismantling its centrifuges. It is just unplugging them. In the meantime, Iran's economy has already started recovering. European, Asian and Arab businessmen are lining up to make deals with a resurgent Iran. Arab diplomats are speaking in measured tones about their Persian neighbor, but behind the scenes, the worries are palpable. The mere prospect of an Iranian presence at the Geneva talks came close to scuttling the diplomatic effort. The U.N. withdrew the invitation after the rebels said they would not attend, and both Washington and Riyadh pressured the U.N. But already Iran and Syria have indicated they have no intention of supporting the meeting's official goal of creating a transitional government to end Syria's war. Syria's regime will likely become more beholden to Iran than ever. A stronger Iran would deepen the divisions separating Sunnis and Shiites, Arabs and Persians, Saudis and Iranians, Palestinians and Israelis, making them all but impossible to bridge. The region would become a greater threat to itself and the world. The talks in Switzerland will now start. But the fighting, torture and killing in Syria will continue, even as former war crimes prosecutors say al-Assad is viciously slaughtering his own people. In the end, much of the Middle East's future will depend on whether negotiators can find a way to stop Iran from advancing its power to the point where it becomes essentially invulnerable. Otherwise, the region will become an even more dangerous and desperate place, as we see today in Syria. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis .","Frida Ghitis: Syria a good example of Iran's growing power in the Middle East .

"(CNN) -- Several hundred of Donna Summer's closest friends and family crowded into a Nashville, Tennessee, church Wednesday afternoon to say goodbye to the queen of disco, who died of lung cancer last week. The family had kept the funeral plans private, but by Wednesday afternoon it was revealed that the service was being held at Christ Presbyterian Church in Nashville. Cameras were not allowed inside. David Foster performed ""The Prayer"" with Natalie Grant, according to Universal Music Enterprises, Summer's record label. Summer's sisters, Linda Gaines Lotman, Mary Ellen Bernard, Dara Bernard and Jenette Yancey, sang ""We've Come This Far By Faith."" Guests included Giorgio Moroder, who produced several of Summer's hits, and singer Tony Orlando. Summer had been a Nashville resident since 1995. Summer's death at age 63 last Thursday began a flow of tributes for the five-time Grammy winner, whose music was a driving beat of the disco era in the last half of the 1970s. ""Her talent was a true gift to the music industry,"" said Neil Portnow, president and CEO of the Recording Academy. ""Few singers have impacted music & the world like Donna Summer! It's the end of an era,"" singer Gloria Estefan wrote on Twitter. ""I can't believe we've lost another wonderful singer,"" Dolly Parton said. ""Donna, like Whitney (Houston), had one of the greatest voices ever. I loved her records. She was the disco queen, and will remain so. I knew her and found her to be one of the most likable and fun people ever. She will be missed and remembered."" Summer, born in Boston to a father who was a butcher and a mother who was a schoolteacher, sang from the moment she learned to talk. Her debut performance came in church at age 10 when the scheduled singer didn't show and the pastor asked Donna to step in. Summer later recalled that the church performance left worshipers in tears. Though she is iconic in the disco genre, her five Grammy wins were also in the R&B, rock, inspirational and dance categories. Donna Summer: A diva who defined the disco moment . In a 2003 interview with CNN, she said the initial absence of a manager led her to do provocative photo shoots. Her public image as a sex symbol and diva conflicted with her religious upbringing, she said. Her grandfather was a minister and her father a church deacon. ""Yes, it was a big complex and the image was sort of created around me,"" Summer said. ""I was sort of there, but not consciously there. And I didn't have anybody sort of on my side at that point, fighting for me, except for me, being in the middle. And then people would say, you know, 'Lay down here and do this.' And you know, whatever,"" Summer said. Summer first rose to fame the mid-'70s, thanks to ""Love to Love You Baby."" With Summer's whispered vocals and orgasmic groans, the song helped define the mid-'70s disco trend and hit No. 2 in 1976. Summer followed the song with such hits as ""I Feel Love,"" ""Last Dance"" and a disco-fied version of the Richard Harris hit ""MacArthur Park,"" which outdid Harris' version by hitting No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart. It was Summer's first of four chart-toppers. But with her 1979 album, ""Bad Girls,"" Summer broke out of the disco mold as the genre, which had become renewed by the success of the ""Saturday Night Fever"" soundtrack, was feeling a backlash. ""Bad Girls"" demonstrated Summer's vocal and stylistic range and produced two No. 1 hits, ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Bad Girls,"" as well as a Top 10 ballad, ""Dim All the Lights."" However, Summer had some trouble adjusting to the changing times. Her next album, ""The Wanderer,"" went for more of a rock feel. It produced a Top 10 hit in the title track but fared relatively poorly on the charts -- especially after the success of ""Bad Girls,"" a double album that spent five weeks at No. 1. It wasn't until 1983's ""She Works Hard for the Money,"" which became a ubiquitous video as well as a big radio hit, that Summer's fame approached its late '70s zenith. Dim all the lights, this 'last dance' goes out to Donna Summer .

"(CNN) -- Berkeley, the famously liberal college town in California, has taken aim at Marine recruiters, saying they are ""not welcome in our city."" Berkeley passed a measure last week encouraging protesters to gather outside the Marine office. Republican lawmakers in Washington fired back this week, threatening to take back more than $2 million of federal funding to the city as well as money designated for the University of California-Berkeley, the campus that became a haven of protests during the Vietnam War. The battle erupted after the Berkeley City Council approved a measure last week urging the Marine recruiters to leave their downtown office. ""If recruiters choose to stay, they do so as uninvited and unwelcome intruders,"" the item says. It goes on to say the council applauds residents and organizations that ""volunteer to impede, passively or actively, by nonviolent means, the work of any military recruiting office located in the City of Berkeley.""  See photos of protesters camped outside Marine office » . Outside the Shattuck Avenue recruiting station earlier this week, a handful of protesters with the anti-war group Code Pink camped out, strumming a guitar as they sang anti-war songs and held signs against the Iraq war. ""Time to end the war, time to end the war, time to end the war right now,"" they sang to the beat of ""I've Been Working on the Railroad.""  Watch protesters sing ""I Ain't Afraid"" » . One giant sign said, ""No Military Predators in Our Town."" Another message on a pink placard read, ""Join the Marines. Travel to Exotic Lands. Meet Exciting and Unusual People -- And Kill Them."" Zanne Joi peered out from under her straw hat. ""This Marine recruiting station is trying to recruit our youth to go to Iraq to kill and be killed. And we are against that,"" said Joi, a member of Code Pink Women for Peace. ""This is part of a multi-pronged effort to end this war."" Protester Sharon Adams added: ""This recruiting station recruits people to go fight and then once they fight and they serve their country, our country doesn't take care of them. That's a shame."" But not everyone here supports the protesters. Watch young men confront protesters » . Forrest Smith, who described himself as a veteran of U.S. Special Forces, said his son recently returned from a tour in Iraq and his daughter served in Afghanistan. ""My position on this is the Marines are the best thing we have,"" said Smith, decked out in Army fatigues. He blasted the City Council for its action. ""It's clearly an abuse of power."" A group of young students who strolled down the sidewalk shared that sentiment. They derided one of the protesters who argued the United States was involved in an illegal war in Iraq. ""Where's the logic in that whatsoever?"" one of the young men said. ""That's our national security, and you're here protesting the Marines."" Another said, ""It makes me sick. It makes me sick."" Gunnery Sgt. Pauline Franklin, a spokeswoman for the Marine Corps Recruiting Command, told CNN there is ""no plan for that office to move."" She said recruiters are there to ""provide information to qualified men and women who are looking for opportunities that they may benefit from by serving in the military."" ""The Marine Corps is here to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, which does guarantee the freedom of speech,"" Franklin said. ""In terms of the situation in Berkeley, the City Council and the protesters are exercising their right to do so."" In Washington, a group of Republican lawmakers have introduced the Semper Fi Act of 2008 -- named after the Marine motto -- to rescind more than $2 million of funds for Berkeley and transfer it to the Marine Corps. ""Like most Americans, I really get disturbed when taxpayer money goes to institutions which proceed to take votes, make policy or make statements that really denigrate the military,"" said Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, a co-sponsor of the bill. He told CNN he believes the bill will pass. ""I think it's going to have significant support."" The bill's co-sponsor, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, said in a written statement, ""Berkeley needs to learn that their actions have consequences."" Berkeley's declaration, which was introduced by the city's Peace and Justice Commission, accuses the United States of having a history of ""launching illegal, immoral and unprovoked wars of aggression and the Bush administration launched the most recent of those wars in Iraq and is threatening the possibility of war in Iran."" It adds, ""Military recruiters are salespeople known to lie to and seduce minors and young adults into contracting themselves into military service with false promises regarding jobs, job training, education and other benefits."" Out on Shattuck Avenue, it appears the protesters have no plans to leave anytime soon. ""We are the civilian population; we control the military,"" Adams said. ""We the people have to take back our control of the military."" E-mail to a friend .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The Pentagon is unable to explain images of what witnesses took to be a high-altitude rocket launched off the coast of Southern California at sunset Monday, officials said. But John Pike, a defense expert who is director of GlobalSecurity.org, said he believes he has solved the mystery. ""It's clearly an airplane contrail,"" Pike said Tuesday afternoon. ""It's an optical illusion that looks like it's going up, whereas in reality it's going toward the camera. The tip of the contrail is moving far too slowly to be a rocket. When it's illuminated by the sunset, you can see hundreds of miles of it ... all the way to the horizon. ""Why the government is so badly organized that they can't get somebody out there to explain it and make this story go away. ... I think that's the real story,"" Pike added. ""I mean, it's insane that with all the money we are spending, all these technically competent people, that they can't get somebody out there to explain what is incredibly obvious."" A U.S. Northern Command official who didn't want to be identified said the contrail could very well be from an airplane. An ""illusion"" effect made the contrail appear as if it's rising straight up, but it's actually level, the official said. The event is similar to another sighting around New Year's Eve in which observers believed they witnessed a missile, he said. Col. Dave Lapan, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said later Tuesday that while there is no evidence that the contrail was left by a missile the department is still investigating. No Defense Department units reported launches at the time. The North American Aerospace Defense Command and the U.S. Northern Command did not report any foreign missile launches off the California coast, Lapan added. Regardless, there was no threat to the United States, he said. Tuesday morning, the Pentagon and the North American Aerospace Defense Command were investigating video shot by a news helicopter operated by CNN affiliate KCBS/KCAL showing an ascending orange-colored contrail high into the atmosphere, officials said. A contrail is the visible vapor trail behind airplanes or rockets traveling at high altitudes. The Federal Aviation Administration, the Coast Guard, Navy, Air Force, and California Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and Jane Harman -- whose coastal districts are closest to the offshore contrails -- were at a loss to explain the images. ""The FAA ran radar replays of a large area west of Los Angeles based on media reports of the possible missile launch at approximately 5 p.m. (PT) on Monday. The radar replays did not reveal any fast moving, unidentified targets in that area,"" said FAA spokesman Ian Gregor. ""The FAA did not receive reports ... of unusual sightings from pilots who were flying in the area on Monday afternoon. ""The FAA did not approve any commercial space launches around the area Monday,"" he added. Lapan said that various agencies are trying to find out what happened. ""I don't know specifically what they are all doing. I just know they have been pinged and that we are talking to the FAA, we are talking to other parts of the U.S. government. We are trying to do everything we can to figure out if anybody has any knowledge of what this event may have been,"" Lapan said in off-camera comments to journalists. ""So far we have come up empty,"" he added. CNN's Charley Keyes and Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","NEW: Pentagon reports no missile launches .

"(CNN) -- When the Department of Justice shut down Megaupload.com last month, it wasn't just Megaupload users' files that went offline. The move prompted changes in the way other file-hosting sites share content and shook up anti-abuse departments across the industry. Since the federal crackdown, third-party aggregate sites no longer link to Megaupload's video host, Megavideo, which has also been shut down. File host videobb did not respond to questions from CNN regarding its anti-abuse policies, but links to the site's content were noticeably absent from sites like Side Reel following Megaupload's shutdown. Direct links to videobb's movies and TV shows that were available less than a month ago are now gone. The change suggests videobb is stepping up anti-abuse efforts in order to avoid the fate of Megaupload, a Hong Kong-based site which is accused of knowingly hosting illegally pirated material. It would be almost impossible for videobb to completely eliminate illegal content, but just the effort to do so may be enough to shield it from criminal charges. Another file-sharing site, BTJunkie, voluntarily shut down Monday. The site's founder told TorrentFreak that recent legal action against Megaupload and other similar services was behind his decision. The Department of Justice has accused Megaupload of willfully breaking copyright law and trying to cover up its actions by hiding illegal materials from the site's public page. Federal prosecutors said the company offered financial incentives for users to illegally upload movies and television shows. It also accused Megaupload officials of discouraging the legitimate use of the site for personal storage by deleting content that was not regularly downloaded. The indictment alleges the company has denied copyright holders an estimated $500 million and that those indicted have earned roughly $175 million in the process. Attorneys for Megaupload have denied the charges. A Department of Justice representative said in an e-mail the agency will only pursue cases like Megaupload's where there was ""sufficient evidence of willful criminal conduct."" That means videobb will likely be safe from criminal charges as long as it continues removing illegal content from third-party aggregate sites. If other companies follow suit, the Justice Department will have accomplished what some have suggested was its primary goal -- making an example of Megaupload to convince other file hosts to step up anti-piracy enforcement. However for some, the elimination of Megaupload as a file-hosting option has made vetting pirated content more difficult. Daniel Raimer, a spokesman for Switzerland-based file host RapidShare, said the company's anti-abuse department has been working overtime since the day last month when Megaupload went offline. The workload is not caused by an increased emphasis on removing copyrighted material, he said, but is necessary to vet a massive influx of files from new customers -- Megaupload's customers. Raimer said the company has not made any changes or improvements to its anti-abuse policies in the wake of the Megaupload scandal. He said it wasn't necessary because RapidShare was already among the toughest in the industry. RapidShare has a three-strike policy for copyright offenders, after which the site deletes users' accounts and all of their files, a tactic which has proved unpopular with ousted users. ""There's some trash talk online, but we're not sad about those comments,"" Raimer said. ""We like bad press from pirates."" RapidShare uses a variety of technical tools to catch abusers, but the site also uses a basic search method identical to what might be employed by any home user. Raimer said RapidShare technicians type words like ""movies, free download"" into search engines to look for illegal movie and TV show downloads on the site. The process can be tedious for the 17-person team. While they comprise nearly a third of RapidShare's staff, Raimer said it is impossible for them to check each of the 400,000 files uploaded to RapidShare each day. He estimates about 5 percent of all files are illegal, but his team can only catch and delete about 1 percent of all uploaded files. Raimer said it has been even more difficult to keep up with incoming content since Megaupload's shutdown because of all the new customers. However despite the increased difficulty, he said RapidShare's commitment to legitimate file-hosting remains the same. Raimer said RapidShare wants to ensure its new customers understand its business model. ""We don't provide any incentive to upload illegal content,"" he said. ""We are determined to show them we don't tolerate that.""","Third-party aggregate sites no longer link to Megaupload's video host, Megavideo .

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- It's called ""cracolandia"" -- crackland -- where drug users crouch underneath plastic tarps and shuffle down a dimly lit road like modern-day zombies. One young woman in jean shorts wanders by, pushing a baby carriage piled high with garbage. There are stacks of disposable plastic water cups used as improvised crack pipes. Brazil has surpassed the United States as the world's No.1 consumer of crack cocaine, according to the Federal University of Sao Paulo. It shares borders with the world's biggest cocaine-producing countries -- Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. Strong economic growth has meant more disposable income for everything from microwave ovens to drugs. North of the famed Maracana soccer stadium in Rio de Janeiro, users in ""cracolandia"" openly smoke the small, single-hit balls that cost 5 reais, or about $2.20. There are between 300 and 400 people camped out at this crack haven every night. One, Zair, rests on crutches as he lights up. ""People say crack is the drug of death, but I don't think it is,"" he said, laughing. ""I've been smoking for eight years."" Tatiana sits on a stained couch nearby. She turns tricks in exchange for crack. When asked whether she wants to get off the streets, she shakes her head and asks for a lighter. Brazil is in the middle of a drug epidemic as it prepares to host the World Cup soccer tournament in 12 cities beginning in June. Billboards reading ""Crack. Freedom or death"" line highways leading to cities and to small farming towns. Officials have launched a string of initiatives to address the addiction with mixed results. Critics say the focus has been on cleaning up the streets rather than specifically addressing the causes of addiction or providing solutions for users. Others are trying to help. One night a week, volunteers from the Evangelical Love of God Church drive to Rio de Janeiro's crack havens in their battered VW van with vats of food. Crack users wait in line for bowls of spaghetti and bow their heads in prayer with the volunteers, themselves recovering addicts. Robson has been free of drugs for three months now. He reads from the Bible and wraps those he recognizes in bear hugs. ""I'm giving witness, showing them what God can do if they're willing,"" he said. A security guard with a wife and children, Robson used drugs for a decade before getting hooked on crack cocaine. ""It was like love at first sight,"" he said. ""But it stole my personality, my whole being."" He ended up on the very same streets where he now works, trying to save lost souls. ""Look at them. They all had lives and families, but they're enslaved by drugs,"" he said. After every visit, a few more people end up back at the dilapidated shelter and rehab center built on the roof of the warehouse-style Evangelical Love of God Church. They sleep on beds crammed 14 to a room and cook meals over open fires. They spend their days in prayer and doing chores: cooking, cleaning, cutting hair. After evening prayer service, they walk to the local football court, sweating it out in two-hour matches. The church was founded by the Rev. Celio Ricardo and his wife. Ricardo says he started using cocaine when he was 15 and wasn't able to break the addiction until he discovered religion. ""You can only understand tears if you've cried. I know their weaknesses,"" he said. Ricardo veers between shouts and tears during his sermons. The recovering addicts and their families fill the pews. Men shake like possessed souls and collapse on the floor. Ricardo encourages the men to live at the rehab center for at least nine months to avoid temptation while they try to break free from their addictions. Nonetheless, two-thirds of them relapse. ""But they have our address when they're ready,"" Ricardo said. ""They know where they can get help, where they can find people who believe they can change."" Robson is back at the makeshift shelter for the second time, but he's optimistic it will be his last. He dreams of being sober in time for his daughter's 15th birthday. ""For the first time, will I be there with her standing next to the cake?"" he asked and flashed a huge smile. He's clean and has the motivation. But he also knows he has fallen before.","Brazil is suffering an epidemic as figures show it is the world's No. 1 crack consumer .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Narendra Modi, the leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, claimed victory as India's next Prime Minister on Friday, bringing to power a man whose controversial past at one point led the United States to deny him a visa. Official results show his party winning at least 275 of 543 parliamentary seats, bringing a clear majority, according to the India Election Commission. It's the first time in three decades that India's 540 million voters delivered a resounding mandate to a single party to rule the world's second-most populous nation. Fractured electoral verdicts leading to coalition governments had been common in India since 1989. Manmohan Singh, India's outgoing Prime Minister, called Modi to congratulate him on his ""party's victory,"" said Singh's Twitter page. Viewed as pro-business, Modi, 63, has pledged reforms to revive the nation's flagging economy. But his past is not without controversy. Throughout his campaign, his relationship with the country's huge Muslim minority came under scrutiny. In 2002, Gujarat state was wracked with anti-Muslim violence, in which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Modi, the state's chief minister, was criticized for not doing enough to halt the violence, but a Supreme Court-ordered investigation absolved him of blame last year. Analysts predict his arrival in India's top office will bring a marked change in direction for the world's most populous democracy, a nation whose modern character has been defined by the defeated Indian National Congress Party, which has been dominant since the country's independence in 1947. Modi's victory had long been anticipated, as polls indicated a slump in support for the ruling Congress Party, which has been dogged by high-profile corruption scandals amid stubborn inflation and a slowed economy. Congress Party spokesman Randeep Surjewala told CNN, ""We bow before the wishes of the people of India with all humility. We will continue to play the role assigned to us. We will try with greater vigor and determination to work with the large populace of this country."" Modi's relationship with the rest of the world . The United States denied Modi a visa over the anti-Muslim violence in 2005, suggesting a strained relationship between the United States and India's next Prime Minister. But President Barack Obama called Modi to congratulate him on winning the election and to invite him to Washington, according to the White House. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also congratulated Modi, saying in a tweet that he looks forward to ""growing shared prosperity."" State Department officials told CNN that Modi will be given a visa to the United States once he takes office and forms a government. The tensions between Modi and the United States in the past could have an impact on relations during his term, said Arati Jerath, an analyst and journalist in India. ""There is a feeling that Narendra Modi will be much more pro-China than pro-U.S., and that could be rooted to the fact that he's had this tension with the United States over his visa, whereas the Chinese laid out the red carpet for him,"" Jerath said. Modi's ascent to the national stage . Celebrations broke out as updates from the five-week-long election were released throughout the day. Modi's supporters sang, danced, played music, threw flowers and even brought elephants into the mix as initial results indicated a huge lead for the BJP. Supporters celebrated outside the party's office and in the streets in Gujarat, where Modi has served as chief minister since 2001. He tweeted: ""Good days are here to come."" At a news conference, BJP chief Rajnath Singh declared, ""Till some time ago, it was said India's success story is over. Now, the time has come to rewrite India's success story."" India's potential for growth was once mentioned in the same breath as that of China. But the world's second-most populous nation has not delivered. Modi, a former tea seller, sprang into the national spotlight for his work in Gujarat, where he cultivated an image of a man who gets things done. Gujarat, a state of some 60 million people, has seen China-like rates of growth in recent years, which have been eyed enviously by the rest of the country. The ""Gujarat model"" of development means a focus on infrastructure, urbanization and eradicating red tape. India's stock market surged Friday as initial results suggested a huge lead for Modi and his party. UK Foreign Minister William Hague congratulated Modi and his party, saying Britain looked ""forward to forging an even closer partnership with India."" CNN's Mallika Kapur, Sumnima Udas and Tim Hume contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama congratulates Narendra Modi and invites him to Washington.

"(CNN) -- A cryptic confession on the popular PostSecret blog had Chicago police searching a city park over the weekend for a possible homicide victim. The anonymous message appeared as one of the Sunday Secrets posted weekly on the PostSecret blog. Followers of the blog mail postcards illustrating their anonymous secrets to website founder Frank Warren. Each Sunday, Warren scans a selection from the thousands mailed to him and uploads them to the blog. The postcard in question appeared as the top image Sunday and showed what appeared to be an aerial map of a park. A Post-It style note attached to the image read, ""I said she dumped me, but really I dumped her (body),"" with a red arrow pointing to a particular spot. Eagle-eyed users of the website Reddit helped identify the exact location on the postcard as Chicago's Jackson Park, and the post quickly spread across social media. It also caught the attention of the Chicago Police. Opinion: How the world shares its secrets . ""We basically had a cryptic message observed on the site pertaining to a possible criminal act,"" Officer John Mirabelli told CNN Monday. ""Officers immediately went to the park and conducted a search. There was no evidence of a crime or anything that was unusual."" Police detectives will continue to investigate, ""but nothing has surfaced to indicate that a crime was committed,"" Mirabelli said. Reaction to the posting varied. On its Twitter page, PostSecret retweeted comments, including one from Paige Bernard, who wrote, ""thank you for posting that really chilling confession. Even the scariest secrets need to be heard."" Another user expressed outrage: ""posting that photo and map of a where a dead woman's body may lay, is exploitative and wrong. What is wrong with you!?!"" Why people share murder, rape on Facebook . While it appears the postcard was a hoax, authorities are not finished with their investigation. ""If the intent behind the message was to cause alarm and cause the police to search that location, then it is a crime -- like screaming fire in a crowded theater,"" Mirabelli said. ""But it depends on the offender -- are we dealing with a child or an adult? A whole lot of factors to consider."" The postcard implying that a killing may have been committed remained at the top of the website Monday. Warren did not return a CNN request Monday for comment. Warren started PostSecret as an art installation in 2004, handing out self-addressed postcards inviting people to share their secrets with him anonymously. The idea went viral, with Warren receiving more than a half-million postcards in nearly 10 years -- all sent to his Germantown, Maryland, home. Secrets range from the funny (""I walk across campus so I can poop in the dorm with the nice bathrooms,"" one secret posted Sunday reads) to the downright eerie (""Everyone who knew me before 9/11 believes I'm dead,"" is one Warren shares regularly when he gives talks on the website on college campuses).

"(CNN) -- For the Scottsboro Boys, justice delayed may be justice denied, but for some observers, it's still sweet. A three-person panel of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles voted unanimously to issue posthumous pardons Thursday to the three Scottsboro Boys who had neither already received a pardon nor had their convictions dropped, a state official said. Thursday's pardons ""remedied a wrongdoing of social and racial injustice,"" said Eddie Cook, assistant director for the board, in an interview with CNN. The pardons were issued to Charles Weems, John Andy Wright and Haywood Patterson, the last of the nine who had been accused in the 1931 rape case, said Cook. ""It has taken 82 years to clear the names of the Scottsboro Boys,"" said Sheila Washington, founder and director of the Scottsboro Boys Museum and Cultural Center. ""And today it happened."" In the case, nine African-American males -- ages 12 to 19 -- were accused of raping two white females on a train in Alabama, said Washington. It was during the Great Depression, and they had hopped aboard boxcars en route to Memphis to seek work, she said. Also on the train was a group of white males who got into a fight with the blacks and were thrown off, she said. The whites went to the police, who stopped the train in the town of Paint Rock, outside Scottsboro. Among those who were aboard the train were the two white females -- one of them 17, the other 21, she said. The older of the two had already had a brush with the law and, under the terms of her release, was not supposed to cross state lines, Washington said. ""She knew if she got caught, she'd have to go to prison,"" she said. So, when the sheriff asked them about why they were on the train, the woman asked him if he was going to arrest her ""after what they did to us,"" Washington said. ""He said, 'What did they do?' She said, 'They raped us.'"" But James Goodman, a professor of history and creative writing at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said it was not clear how the women came to make their accusations to the posse. When the posse stopped the train and found nine black men, they also found the two white women dressed in men's overalls, said Goodman, author of ""Stories of Scottsboro"" (1994). ""Thousands and thousands of people are hoboing around in search of a bread line, in search of work,"" he said. ""Most of them, but hardly all of them, men. Women dressed in work clothes so they wouldn't be conspicuous."" ""My guess is they saw the nine black men, saw the two white women and they said, 'Did they bother you?'"" The women may have faced trouble for crossing state lines or for hoboing, but that is not certain, he said. ""All we know is that somehow, at Paint Rock, a charge of rape emerges and the case begins there."" The suspects underwent a series of trials in Scottsboro and Decatur and were found guilty each time. All-white juries sentenced all but the youngest to death. ""A judge declared a mistrial in the last case, which saved their lives,"" said Washington. Including the appeals, there were four trials and seven retrials, Goodman said. When all was said and done, each of the nine spent as few as six years and as many as 19 years in jail. The last of the Scottsboro Boys was released in 1950, though one of them ended up back in jail again, said Goodman. Alabama dropped rape charges against five of the defendants, and the sixth, Clarence Norris, received a pardon from Gov. George Wallace in 1976, she said. The trials resulted in two landmark U.S. Supreme Court decisions -- one requiring that defendants be tried by juries of their peers, meaning blacks in their cases; the other requiring that indigent defendants receive competent counsel. The three men's relatives had been invited to attend Thursday's hearing, but none did so, Cook said. Attendees at Thursday's event included Arthur Orr, a Republican state senator who sponsored Act 2013-081, which passed this year giving the board the authority to grant posthumous pardons for convictions that occurred at least 75 years prior. Also in attendance was a representative of Gov. Robert Bentley and several university professors, all of whom supported the bill. The case helped reignite the civil rights movement after years of slumber, said Goodman. ""African-Americans had never stopped agitating for their rights after reconstruction, but this is the beginning -- once again -- of an interracial movement for equality that had been stalled between the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of the Depression."" He added, ""Suddenly, white people who just hadn't been paying attention begin to say, 'Holy mackerel, they're going to put nine African-American teenagers in the electric chair?"" Much has changed since those days, Goodman said, citing the nation's first black president. But the criminal justice system is still not colorblind, he added. ""Sadly, our prisons are still full of youngish black people who have been falsely accused of crime. Your chance, even to this day, of being incarcerated for something that you didn't do are still much greater if your skin is black or dark.""

"Brownsville, Texas (CNN) -- Eulalia Garcia Maturey has outlived two husbands, her two children and decades of bygone immigration laws. At 101, Maturey will become a U.S. citizen on the 101st anniversary of her crossing into the United States from Mexico. The naturalization ceremony will take place Tuesday afternoon in a federal courtroom in Brownsville, Texas, according to the Department of Homeland Security's Citizenship and Immigration Services. Maturey described the feeling of becoming a citizen with one word: ""Libre,"" Spanish for ""free."" And then in a feisty Spanish voice that makes it hard to believe she's only 4-foot-7, she explained why becoming a citizen at this late stage of her life is so important. ""I want to spend the rest of my days in this life living legally in the United States,"" Maturey told CNN this week. ""I was raised here, and I want to die here."" Maturey also said she feels American in every way but knows that technically she's not an American, at least not yet. Eulalia Maturey's path to citizenship is a tale that captures the unusual way of life on the Texas-Mexico border. On October 12, 1909, Maturey was just a baby in her mother's arms crossing the Rio Grande on a ferry boat from Matamoros, Mexico, into Brownsville, Texas. In those days, crossing the border was a simple routine. There were no border patrol agents, and checkpoints focused on customs and trade issues, according to Anthony Knopp, a history professor at the University of Texas at Brownsville specializing in U.S.-Mexico border relations. ""We were on the fringe back in those days,"" said Knopp. ""It wasn't hard to cross the border. There was nobody looking to round people up and send them back to Mexico."" Maturey and her single mother settled into a quiet life in Brownsville. Her mother earned money washing clothes, but she never met her father. Maturey dropped out of school after third grade. ""I didn't want to go anymore,"" Maturey said. So then she started helping her mother sift through the growing piles of laundry that needed to be washed and folded. Maturey married her first husband at 16; he died five years later. Shortly after, she married her second husband and had two children. In 1940, Congress passed the World War II Alien Registration Act, which made it a federal crime to advocate overthrowing the government. But the law also required noncitizens already in the country to register with the government. Maturey did so along with millions of others in the United States. Just before the start of World War II, Maturey received a ""Certificate of Lawful Entry"" card from the U.S. government issued to her on April 4, 1941. She never imagined that little document would make it possible for her to become a U.S. citizen. She figured it came with an expiration date. For decades, Maturey didn't really know what her legal status was in the United States. She feared asking too many questions might get her deported. She crossed the border routinely to visit family in Mexico. Border agents rarely asked for any documentation and when they did, she simply called herself a U.S. citizen. Then in 2008, the United States started requiring everyone to show a passport when crossing the border. Maturey knew she couldn't take anymore chances; it was time to find out once and for all where she stood. Maturey's niece, Yolanda Ovalle, took her to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Brownsville, and that's where they met Sheila Lucio, a 29-year veteran of the government agency. ""I fell in love with her. She's real feisty,"" Lucio told CNN. When Lucio tried finding Eulalia Maturey's name in the computer system, she couldn't find it. ""If you came to us before we entered the computer age, we didn't have your records,"" said Lucio. So Maturey pulled out that 69-year-old ""Lawful Entry"" card. Her niece says she took care of that little piece of paper for decades. ""The permit is perfectly cared for,"" said Yolanda Ovalle. ""She's a perfect lady."" With that document, government officials were able to find her Legal Permanent Resident documents in the archives in Washington. ""We would never have been able to establish her registration status without that document,"" said Maria Elena Garcia-Upson, a public affairs officer with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. ""It would have been hard to prove."" The paperwork is all squared away. Maturey passed the citizenship exam and now 101 years after that short ferry ride across the Rio Grande with her mother, Eulalia Maturey is set to become a citizen of the United States. It will be an emotional day for Maturey's family, but they've never seen her cry and they wonder if this will be the day they'll see a tear. ""Quien sabe?"" said Maturey. ""Who knows?""","Eulalia Garcia Maturey still had 69-year-old ""Lawful Entry"" card given to her in 1941 .

"(CNN) -- ""I believe that we will win!"" The refrain is consistently chanted by the American Outlaws, the supporters group for the U.S. national soccer team, and it now rings truer than ever. We weren't supposed to win. But we did. The opening match of the World Cup against Ghana was a must-win for the U.S. team -- anything short of a victory, and the red, white and blue would have faced a seemingly insurmountable hill to climb. The Americans were given little chance of winning against their nemesis, Ghana. The team from Western Africa had beaten the U.S. twice before in the World Cup -- knocking it out of contention in 2010 as well as four years earlier. This time was supposed to be no different. Tough conditions. Untimely injuries. A late equalizer. Everything pointed toward the Americans wilting in the Brazilian humidity. We weren't supposed to win. But we did. Americans don't follow the world's script. Rising to the world's stage from vastly different backgrounds, these Americans stayed united -- symbolic of our great nation. When adversity struck, they battled. They persevered. They won with typical American character and diversity. Monday's victory sets the stage for a major match Sunday against Portugal -- which Germany downed 4-0. The winner will be one step closer to the ultimate Cup. But it really confirmed to the rest of the world that U.S. football (OK, we also call it soccer) will not go gently into that good night. No way. In the end, two American heroes of completely different backgrounds provided the scoring punch that stunned Ghana. Clint Dempsey, born in Nacogdoches, Texas, and John Anthony Brooks, born in Berlin. Dempsey is a player we are proud to have wear the Seattle Sounders FC kit, and Brooks is an up-and-comer in the German Bundesliga -- or football league -- with Hertha BSC. Dempsey, the 31-year-old captain, is playing in his third World Cup, while Brooks, the 21-year-old newcomer, is making his competitive debut as an emergency substitute. Dempsey played the creative genius for a workmanlike U.S. team, and Brooks stood tall as a powerful 6-foot-4 defender. Their goals were reflective of their personality. Dempsey brilliantly allowed the ball to pass through his legs on his way to three wicked touches with his right foot, setting up his left peg for a drive to the far post just 29 seconds into the match. Then, loping forward on a late corner kick, Brooks rose above the Ghanaian defense to drive his header low and hard, just out of the reach of the goalkeeper in the 86th minute. As the final whistle blew, the reactions were priceless. Players born in all corners of the United States celebrated with their teammates from Iceland, Germany and Norway. German-born head coach Jurgen Klinsmann embraced his Austrian assistant coach, Andy Herzog. Some 20,000 fans who traveled to Brazil from the United States sang and danced in excitement. And tens of millions of Americans back home watched the whole scene unfold, evoking national pride for the greatest melting pot on Earth. The victory was perfectly America. Grit. Determination. Mental toughness. It was American diversity coming together for a common goal. It was a team, cobbled together over the past three years, which had a singular focus on beating Ghana. The World Cup has just begun for the Americans. And there is much work left to do. But a soccer nation back home in the United States is energized, emboldened, hopeful. With old-fashioned American character and ingenuity, the U.S. national team is poised to do great things in Brazil. Just one game into the tournament, and the country is captivated. Americans can relate to this group of soccer players, whose diversity and spirit is akin to that of their supporters. ""I believe that we will win!"" And we will do it the American Way.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- The United States may have been behind the killing of Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year-old Iranian woman whose fatal videotaped shooting Saturday made her a symbol of opposition to the June 12 presidential election results, the country's ambassador to Mexico said Thursday. Neda Agha-Soltan, 26, was shot to death in Tehran on Saturday. ""This death of Neda is very suspicious,"" Ambassador Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri said. ""My question is, how is it that this Miss Neda is shot from behind, got shot in front of several cameras, and is shot in an area where no significant demonstration was behind held?"" He suggested that the CIA or another intelligence service may have been responsible. ""Well, if the CIA wants to kill some people and attribute that to the government elements, then choosing women is an appropriate choice, because the death of a woman draws more sympathy,"" Ghadiri said. In response, CIA spokesman George Little said, ""Any suggestion that the CIA was responsible for the death of this young woman is wrong, absurd and offensive."" Though the video appeared to show that she had been shot in the chest, Ghadiri said that the bullet was found in her head and that it was not of a type used in Iran. ""These are the methods that terrorists, the CIA and spy agencies employ,"" he said. ""Naturally, they would like to see blood spilled in these demonstrations, so that they can use it against the Islamic Republic of Iran. This is of the common methods that the CIA employs in various countries."" But, he added, ""I am not saying that now the CIA has done this. There are different groups. It could be the [work of another] intelligence service; it could be the CIA; it could be the terrorists. Anyway, there are people who employ these types of methods."" Asked about his government's imposition of restrictions on reporting by international journalists, Ghadiri blamed the reporters themselves. ""Some of the reporters and mass media do not reflect the truth,"" he said. For example, he said, international news organizations have lavished coverage on demonstrations by supporters of Mir Hossein Moussavi, whom the government has said lost to the incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by a landslide. But those same news organizations have not shown ""many, many demonstrations in favor of the winner,"" he said. Further, he said, members of the international news media have failed to report on people setting banks and buses afire or attacking other people. ""The only things they show are the reactions of the police,"" he said. Because of restrictions on reporting in Iran, CNN has been unable to confirm many of the reports and claims relating to protests. Ghadiri said it is only fair that security forces protect the lives and property of the Iranian people. ""If in America supporters of Mr. McCain had gotten out on the street and tried to burn the banks during the last election, do you think the police would just sit idly by and be a spectator?"" he asked, referring to the GOP presidential candidate who lost the presidential vote in November to Barack Obama. Ghadiri called on backers of Moussavi to ""accept the majority's victory."" Ahmadinejad's overwhelming victory was no surprise, Ghadiri said, noting that a poll published in the United States three weeks before the June 12 elections showed Ahmadinejad with a commanding lead. ""Why don't you show that?"" he asked. Ghadiri also addressed questions about the rapid reporting of the election results, which the opposition has cited as evidence that the ballots were not properly counted. ""It wasn't said that only four people counted the 40 million votes,"" he said. ""There were tens of thousands of people in Iran who counted these votes. They declared that this is very simple.""","Ambassador to Mexico says CIA or other intelligence service may be to blame .

"(CNN) -- Two decades ago, I strode out of my house and knew I'd never think of it as my home again. I hugged my mother goodbye and climbed into the car with my dad, my tape collection and every decent piece of clothing I owned. When he made the multistate drive back from dropping me off at college, the car would be empty, and the house would, to me, no longer be our family home -- just my parents' house. Recently, it ceased to be even that. A few months ago, my parents handed the keys over to a real estate agent and, for the first time in more than 40 years, were no longer homeowners. They headed southeast from Kentucky to a retirement community near my sister in South Carolina. If all goes as planned, they'll spend the rest of their days in blissful, assisted leisure. For them, there will be no more fussing over gutter clogs, leaf piles, loose shingles or any of the other burdens of ownership. While their house has weathered the passage of time well -- even gotten more elegant in the absence of two squabbling, headstrong daughters -- my mother has not. My dad will benefit from the on-hand help with her care, and she will be less isolated by her declining health and mobility. They feel freed by shedding the house and its baggage. I am thrilled for them -- and yet unexpectedly adrift. I know how lucky I was to grow up in that solid red brick house: leak-free, clean and warm enough when it needed to be. But I find myself not mourning its loss. For many people, a childhood home acts as a satellite heart, the warm and beating core of family. They're at their most complete in the center of it, surrounded by loved ones, with the artifacts of an idyllic past intact. A visit home comforts and charges them to face the challenges of the outside world; for me, it always chafed and drained my spirit. This was not the fault of the people inside. I was just wired incompatibly with the place I was raised. Every room you live in preserves a frozen version of the person you once were, for better or worse. A few blocks from the home I share with my husband and our dogs, I can stroll by the apartment building where I spent eight bachelorette years. I thrived, loved, cried, created and blossomed there, and I almost inevitably light up in recollection of happy times inside that fifth-floor walk-up. That's rarely the case when I think of the house where I grew up. I was a weird, low and lonely kid when I lived there, awkward in my own skin and aching for the day I could fly far, far away and metamorphose into the adult I dreamed of being. At best, the house on Manor Lane afforded me refuge from a small-town suburban world that wasn't especially thrilled to have me in it. My parents were kind and attuned enough to let me cocoon myself in the basement, setting up a painting (and, let's face it, sulking) studio where I was free to make terrible art and dreadful poetry and go about the business of being a misfit teen, biding time until my escape. At worst, and especially after I'd moved away and begun building a happier life, a night back in my childhood bed could easily press the air from my chest. The room exerted a nearly physical force on my body, and I'd react by shutting down: sleeping too much, mostly to shield myself from the ghosts of my misfit past. But they've begun to haunt my home 570 miles away. Some parents institute a purge as soon as their children move away, unsentimentally chucking report cards, finger paintings, trophies and all the other detritus of youth. (""You better come get this stuff or I'm tossing it ..."") My parents were dedicated chroniclers of their daughters' lives -- the good, the bad and the terribly ugly haircuts. In the process of streamlining their belongings, they began shipping this stuff to us. The U.S. mail became a time machine, delivering odds and ends including third-grade conduct reports and an inexplicable pencil drawing of the main characters from ""Moonlighting."" (Like I said, I was a weird kid.) Rereading the ""deep"" and deeply hackneyed poetry you wrote in high school can take you down a peg, no matter how strong your adult self-image. And it's incredibly disconcerting to see long-forgotten fossils of the past -- a spelling bee medal, a lumpy art class ashtray, a tragically dorky class picture -- existing in the same physical space as the carefully curated objects of one's grown-up home.

"(CNN) -- The Bluefin-21's initial search is nearing its end. As the underwater sonar device plunged into the Indian Ocean, kicking off its 14th mission, authorities are focusing on what they will do if it comes up empty. That outcome would seem likely. The Bluefin has slowly scoured 95% of the ocean floor that searchers had narrowed down for it. So far, it has found no trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Anticipation is growing as this phase of the search nears its end, but experts say factors like the depth and terrain of the search area mean that the mission's completion could be a day to weeks away. If nothing is found, the first step, Australian officials said, may be to expand the search area where the submersible was looking. The underwater search so far has focused on a circle with a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) radius around the location of a detected ""ping,"" the Joint Agency Coordination Center said. If the Bluefin-21 searches 100% of the area with nothing to show for it, the underwater search may expand to outside that radius. ""We are currently consulting very closely with our international partners on the best way to continue the search into the future,"" the Australian-based center coordinating the search said in a statement. Forty-nine days since the plane vanished, Malaysian and Australian authorities are mapping out a strategy for a long-term search that could expand to cover a massive area. A U.S. Navy source told CNN on Friday that the current search area is expected to move slightly north if the Bluefin doesn't find any wreckage. Specifically, it might shift to encompass a 6-mile radius around where another ""ping"" was detected. And it's possible the search for the plane -- which disappeared March 8 after leaving Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for Beijing -- could balloon. Ocean search specialist Rob McCallum thinks it may end up including all 370 miles (595 kilometers) of what authorities believe was the plane's flight path. ""If the idea is to go more strategic and investigate the entire aircraft flight path, maybe 15 miles or so either side, then you need a more strategic tool. And something like a deep-towed sonar that can provide a very large range indeed -- at the expense of resolution."" The use of a deep-towed submersible device called the Orion is overdue, said Geoffrey Thomas, managing director of AirlineRatings.com. ""That should be brought in as quickly as possible, again, from the United States."" Early into mission 13, Bluefin-21 encountered a software issue which required resetting. The problem was resolved, the Joint Agency Coordination Centre announced. Malaysia's report . Facing anger from families of Flight 370 passengers, Malaysia's Prime Minister said Thursday his government will release its preliminary report on the plane's disappearance. In a TV exclusive with CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest, Prime Minister Najib Razak told CNN the report will be available to the public next week. He also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week, his office said. Najib discussed why he is not yet officially declaring the flight -- and the 239 people on board -- lost. The report has been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. body for global aviation, but not yet made available to the public. The U.N. organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by Malaysia that the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. It's the same recommendation that was made after the Air France Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. Skeptical relatives . The Prime Minister's comments didn't convince Sarah Bajc, whose partner, Philip Wood, was a passenger on the plane. She accused Najib of ""political maneuvering,"" shirking responsibility and deflecting blame. ""I spent most of the morning with my jaw basically scraping the floor,"" Bajc told CNN's ""AC360Â°."" Malaysian authorities need to do a better job of communicating with the families and answering their questions during briefings, she said, rather than treating passengers' loved ones ""as if we are the enemy, as opposed to an interested party in helping to solve this mystery."" ""Actions speak louder than words,"" she said. ""The briefings are a joke. ...The patience level of the families group is just gone."" The husband of passenger Chandrika Sharma said he appreciated that the Prime Minister is avoiding declaring the plane lost and admitted that mistakes were made. But he wants to see more from officials. ""At least one can hope this is the beginning of the next few weeks where we can see a lot more transparency, a lot more directness,"" K.S. Narendran told CNN's ""New Day."" A committee representing some of the Chinese families have posted 26 questions about the plane's disappearance on the Chinese social media site Weibo. Malaysia has insisted it has nothing to hide and is working to find answers. The country has not been known as a model of transparency. The same political party has ruled for 50 years, and the media are not completely free. The Malaysian Cabinet has agreed to have an international team investigate the disappearance of Flight 370, acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said. He also said the team will not be looking into the criminal aspects of the investigation, which remain under the Royal Malaysia Police. Turning to Boeing? Angry families dissatisfied with responses from Malaysian authorities could turn their attention to the Boeing 777's manufacturer. Some of the questions the families have, including technical questions, ""we will be bringing directly to Boeing,"" Bajc said. ""Boeing is a publicly traded company in the United States, and that puts them in a position of a little bit more fiduciary responsibility,"" she said. Asked for a response, Boeing sent CNN a statement: ""Our thoughts and deepest sympathies continue to be with the families and loved ones of those aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Boeing continues to serve as a technical adviser to the U.S. National Transportation (Safety) Board, and in that role we have been an active and engaged party to the investigation."" ""Boeing has a shareholders meeting next week,"" Bajc said, adding it might be worth trying to get some answers there. What if Flight 370 is never found? Inside a black box investigation lab .

"(CNN) -- Since April, 117 law enforcement agencies in 18 states have decided to ignore U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to keep foreign-born people in jail on suspicion they might be undocumented immigrants. These ""detainers"" ask local and county agencies to hold individuals up to 48 hours after local charges are resolved to allow ICE time to investigate their immigration status. California, Oregon and Washington state have seen the highest number of agencies changing their policies out of fear of being sued. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office in Florida and Polk County Sheriff's Office in Iowa last week were the latest agencies to change their detainer policies. Police agencies began reacting after several federal judges ruled that police were violating the constitutional rights by not releasing the immigrants after resolving their state charges. The advocacy group Catholic Legal Immigration Network says that more than 190 agencies in three states and the District of Columbia enacted policies that reduce or eliminate cooperation with ICE detainers. But ICE spokesman Nestor Yglesias disputed that number, saying that ""U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is aware of 134 different law enforcement agencies throughout the country that are no longer honoring ICE detainers."" That number includes agencies that opted out before April. Fred Wilson, director of operations for the National Sheriffs' Association, which represents most of the 3,083 sheriff's agencies in the country, said the national organization has not taken an official position on the matter. ""It's not a viral movement, but it's raising some legitimate legal issues,"" Wilson. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office explained its new policy: ""Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office will require Orders of Deportation or Warrants signed by a federal judge/magistrate, or other court related order, to hold individuals beyond the time they would otherwise be released,"" the agency said in a written statement. The issue boils down to due process, immigration advocates say. Every person in the United States -- citizen or illegal immigrant, has the same basic right of due process under the Constitution, says south Florida immigration attorney Jeffrey Devore. ""Detain first, ask questions later,"" is the problem with ICE detainers, Devore said. ""Under our Constitution, you have to have some reasonable reason to detain people."" In an Oregon case, Maria Miranda-Olivares pleaded guilty to violating a domestic restraining order and was sentenced to time served. Clackamas County officials held Olivares 19 additional hours until transferring her into federal custody under an ICE detainer. She sued and on April 11 a federal judge found the county violated her Fourth Amendment rights for unreasonable search and seizure by holding her without probable cause and with no warrant for her arrest. The federal judge in Oregon cited other cases that ICE immigration detainers are ""requests"" -- and, therefore, not mandatory. Yglesias, in a written statement said, ""When law enforcement agencies turn over criminals into ICE custody rather than into the community, it helps protect both public safety and the safety of law enforcement."" Law enforcement sends fingerprints of anyone arrested in the United States to the FBI and prints of those born outside the United States are forwarded to ICE for an immigration status check. The Secure Communities program, started under President George W. Bush in 2008 and expanded largely under the Obama administration, was designed to prevent undocumented immigrants from committing serious crimes. ICE updated its policy last year and eliminated detainer requests for undocumenteds arrested for misdemeanors and petty crimes, saying its priority is to remove undocumented immigrants who commit serious crimes. In 2013, ICE removed 368,644 immigrants from the United States. Most were apprehended crossing the border illegally. Of those arrested within the country, ICE says 82% had been previously convicted of a crime. Advocates for immigrants are concerned the increased deportations separate families, said Jennifer Riddle, an attorney with the Catholic Legal Immigration Network. Pro-immigrant groups have pushed hard for law enforcement agencies, and local and state government officials to change their detainer policies. The Immigration Legal Resource Center focuses its online efforts to teach advocates how to best ""explain the risk of civil liability if they continue to hold immigrants for ICE,"" Riddle said. ""It's not the local law enforcement's job to do immigration enforcement,"" Riddle said. ""They are to protect their local community,"" said the advocate. The Broward County Sheriff's Office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is taking steps to avoid legal pitfalls. In its decision to not enforce ICE detainers, its attorney cites two judges' rulings against police agencies. ""In light of these cases, personnel should not honor ICE detainers unless they are supported by probable cause,"" wrote the sheriff's legal in June. In Austin, Texas, Travis County Sheriff Greg Hamilton disagreed with county commissioners decision to stop enforcing federal detainers. The sheriff said his organization will continue to honor the federal request since it keeps his community safe.","Police agencies declining to hold suspects for immigration authorities over lawsuit fears .

"(CNN) -- Juan Martin del Potro is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines after the world No. 8 announced he will undergo wrist surgery on Monday. The 2009 U.S. Open champion, who needs surgery to fix a problem with his left wrist, had a similar operation on his right wrist in 2010 and was subsequently out for eight months. The Argentine first felt pain in his left wrist in August 2012 and he took painkillers to deal with the injury at last year's U.S. Open. But the problem resurfaced at January's Australian Open, the first grand slam of 2014, where Del Potro lost in the second round to Roberto Bautista Agut. ""I want to tell you that after a period of medical treatment, in which we tried to be competitive on a tennis court, and following new examinations done today, my doctor Richard Berger, decided that I should have surgery to fix the problem on my left wrist,"" the 25-year-old said on his official Facebook page. ""Obviously, it's not the easiest choice or the happiest moment of my career. I experienced a similar situation and I know how hard it is to be out of the tour, the desire to return, the endless weeks of recovery and how difficult it is to start fighting for the top spots in the rankings again."" Since returning from his right wrist injury in 2010, Del Potro has claimed 11 titles -- most recently defeating Bernard Tomic to win January's Sydney International event. ""As always, thank you to those who express their support in any part of Argentina and the world, during tournaments, on the streets or social networks,"" added Del Potro. ""The strength you send me and my desire will be crucial during my recovery."" The highlight of Del Potro's career so far came at Flushing Meadows five years ago, when he beat Roger Federer in five sets to win his first grand slam title.","Juan Martin del Potro to undergo wrist surgery .

"(CNN) -- Sympathy for biting footballer Luis Suarez has been in short supply, but Friday the Uruguayan found support from an unlikely candidate -- his latest victim. Bitten on the shoulder by Suarez during Tuesday's match against Uruguay, Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini labelled the four-month ban handed down to Suarez by football's global governing body FIFA as ""excessive."" ""Now inside me there's no feelings of joy, revenge or anger against Suarez for an incident that happened on the pitch and that's done,"" Chiellini told his personal webiste. ""There only remains the anger and the disappointment about the match,"" added the Juventus defender, referring to Italy's exit from the World Cup after Uruguay's 1-0 win. But FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke stood by the punishment handed out by the world governing body and told reporters that Suarez should seek professional help after his latest biting incident. ""I think he should find a way to stop doing it,"" said Valcke. ""He should go through a treatment. It is definitely wrong."" Suarez has returned to a hero's welcome in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo while his countrymen prepare to play Colombia in the round of 16 on Saturday in Rio de Janeiro. The Liverpool star's punishment, which also includes a nine-match international ban, prohibits him from football-related activities, meaning he will be prevented from training with his teammates until late October. ""I sincerely hope that he will be allowed, at least, to stay close to his teammates during the games because such a ban is really alienating for a player,"" added Chiellini. ""At the moment my only thought is for Luis and his family, because they will face a very difficult period."" The president of the Uruguayan Football Association confirmed it will appeal against Suarez's ban as one of his personal sponsors announced it was terminating its contract with the player. ""888poker signed Luis Suarez following a fantastic season for which his achievements were widely recognized,"" said gambling website 888poker.com in a statement. ""Regrettably, following his actions during Uruguay's World Cup match against Italy on Tuesday, 888poker has decided to terminate its relationship with Luis Suarez with immediate effect."" The bite on Chiellini is the third such offense of Suarez's career. When playing with Dutch club Ajax in 2007 he was suspended for seven games for biting an opponent, while he was hit with a 10-match sanction for an identical offense while playing for Liverpool in April 2013. Suarez also courted controversy in 2011, when he was handed an eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. Following previous indiscretions, Suarez has enjoyed the backing of his club Liverpool. According to Spanish radio network Cadena COPE, Suarez's lawyer will meet with representatives of the English Premier League team in Barcelona. Suarez has been heavily linked with a move away from Liverpool and, with the 27-year-old set to miss the first nine games of the Premier League season, it remains to be seen whether the Anfield team will continue to stand by its man. Argentina great Diego Maradona has also come out in support of SuÃ¡rez, likening the ban to being ""handcuffed"" and ""thrown in Guantanamo."" Beckenbauer ban lifted . Meanwhile, FIFA has lifted its ban on German legend Franz Beckenbauer for failing to cooperate with its investigation of alleged corruption in the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Beckenbauer, a World Cup winner as a player and coach, was handed a 90-day suspension earlier this month, but it has now been revoked, the world governing body announced Friday. Beckenbauer had claimed that the questions he was being asked to answer were in complicated English, but in a statement released on Twitter by his manager Marcus Hoefl, he admitted he had ""under-estimated the matter."" Hoefl had confirmed on Twitter on June 18 that his client had since given detailed replies to the FIFA ethics committee probe, which is being headed by American lawyer Michael Garcia. The 68-year-old Beckenbauer, who was a member of the FIFA executive committee which awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, will not be traveling to Brazil for the current competition, Hoefl also confirmed.","Giorgio Chiellini says ban handed to Luis Suarez is ""excessive""

"(CNN) -- Lesley Kinzel is not a size zero. She's not a size 6 or 16 either. She wears a U.S. size 26, has no plans to change that and she'd be more than happy to share her style advice with you. Kinzel, a 35-year-old associate editor at xoJane.com and author of the upcoming ""Two Whole Cakes,"" is part of an increasingly popular online movement that celebrates fashion for larger women -- without a tent dress or body-camouflaging cardigan in sight. The authors of so-called ""fatshion"" blogs -- with names like Fat Girls Like Nice Clothes Too, Manolo for the Big Girl, Curves to Kill and Thicker Than Your Average Girl -- seek to send an empowering message to their plus-sized sisters: We're here, we're fat, we look just fabulous -- and you can, too. ""Fat"" is a loaded word, often wielded as a weapon, but Kinzel hopes to lessen its power to wound. ""Learning to use the word 'fat' as a basic descriptor, stripping it of its negative baggage, was a huge part of my self-acceptance process,"" she says. ""Some women never get comfortable with it, and I understand that -- for some, it's been used as a weapon for too long for anything positive to be salvaged. ""But I love the word 'fat' precisely because my candid and positive use of it often shocks people...it means everyone who hears the word 'fat' from me is having to take a moment to think about what I mean by it, and to resist the knee-jerk assumption that I must mean something bad."" With that in mind, she created a blog, Fatshionista, in 2007. Though many of the original postings are now archived at her ""body politics, social justice activism and pop-cultural criticism"" blog, Two Whole Cakes, her writing shares a body-positive message for women she feels are not represented as beautiful and desirable in mainstream media. Growing up, she says, ""I didn't have many famous examples of positive fat-lady representation. I mean, there was Roseanne. I loved Roseanne, but not because she was beautiful -- I loved her because she was smart and tough and didn't take crap from anyone."" Fat girls representing themselves as confident, smart and resourceful is key, Kinzel says. ""If we wait for television and magazines to do this for us, we're going to be waiting a very long time,"" she says. ""So we do it ourselves."" Jessica Kane, creator of Life and Style of Jessica (tagline ""Real is perfect!"") and owner of Skorch Plus Size Style Magazine, agrees with the importance of owning words as a first step to self-acceptance. Some girls might see themselves as curvy, while others see themselves as plus-sized. She says, ""I do embrace the word 'fat,' because I am. It's not mean or spiteful, but a fact."" Kane recalls, ""I grew up in a broken home with no role models, and was tortured in high school for not being cool enough and never had a boyfriend. It was after high school and realizing the larger world around me and being exposed to plus-size fashion via the Internet that I started to see I was not the minority and there were women who were confident and my size. Those women gave me strength, and I hope to pass that along as well."" With her blog, she's taken control of the message in the way an occasional ""special section"" or magazine insert never would. ""The majority of women need to be represented, and blogs like mine that thrive with hundreds of thousands of views a month show that there are women who want to see more. We need the thin girls next to the big girls as well as the brown girls next to the white girls. Diversity is key,"" Kane says. ""There's nothing more empowering than connecting with women just like you. No matter what you're going through, you aren't alone."" The problem for many women, no matter their level of body acceptance, is simply finding attractive clothes in their size. It's easy for bigger women to feel like no trendy clothes exist in their size, and they have no right to wear them, to be seen, to be active participants in fashion. As Kinzel says, ""The fatter you get the harder it is."" Bloggers share their plus-sized fashion finds from mainstream retailers like Lane Bryant, Top Shop and Torrid, as well as delving into more niche designers and outlets like Domino Dollhouse, Qristyl Frazier Designs, Monif C. and the Curve line from ASOS. They post pictures and links from the catalogues -- or even of themselves modeling the clothes, looking confident and gorgeous as all get out. Dee S., an 21-year-old Irish woman who blogs at Pearls, Lace and Ruffles says she's a ""5'3""-apple-shaped-plus-sized-gal"" who carries her weight in her midsection, so even fashion for large girls rarely fits her. Her secret is to remain open to possibilities. ""The best way to find clothes is just to go out shopping and don't restrict yourself. I used to avoid the 'normal' side of Forever 21's store and go straight for the plus section -- but now I browse the whole store. If I see something I like in the regular section, I try it on. Most times, if it's a stretchy or knit fabric, then a size large will fit me,"" Dee says. Designer Angela Zampell noticed this inequity in the marketplace and decided to expand her already popular Mode Merr clothing line to, as her company's tagline says, dress ""stylish women from xxs-xxxl."" ""I truly believe that there is room for woman to feel sexy in their clothes. I saw a definite need for a wider size range in the market. It's not fair for just the tiny ladies to have the best selection,"" Zampell says. ""I think that the key is not to forget that larger gals still have a shape and it isn't square."" Her bold, curve-hugging clothing (she has an item called the ""Everybody Loves Cleavage Blouse"") has become a favorite of the plus-sized blogosphere, as well as the generally body-positive burlesque community. She sees the lack of flattering clothing as a result of social prejudice, rather than a result of any perceived figure flaws. ""It's much easier to design for curves,"" she notes. For Kinzel, Kane and Dee, there are tremendous rewards in helping other women realize their beauty potential, but it has not been without risks. It is, after all, the Internet, and with that, the inevitable rain of anonymous hostility from people offended that a larger woman would dare to find herself attractive. ""The people who get angriest about fat girls looking good and feeling hot are the people who are the most strongly invested in the idea that a person has to be skinny in order to be happy, healthy, and loved,"" Kinzel says. ""Very often it's people just projecting their own body-loathing onto someone else; if you're truly comfortable and confident in your own skin, it shouldn't make a difference to you what anyone else is wearing, or how they look. It only affects you if it's making you question your assumptions, about both other people and about yourself."" Dee says she's weathered worse in person. When people see a bigger girl enjoying herself, they're shocked, she says. At a club with her friends, a man referred to her as the ""fat bitch."" She responded, ""Yes, I'm fat, so what?"" The look on his face, she says, was priceless. ""Where I live, most women over a size 16 tend to wear long skirts and baggy dresses, so people sometimes double-take when they see a big girl in a mini dress or cute blouse and heels."" Kane chalks the reactions up to jealousy and notes that in the bigger-girl blogosphere, it can cut both ways. ""That person judging and knocking a thinner woman for feeling great is probably jealous that that person feels so great about themselves, and secretly wishing they had that too,"" she says. Kinzel, however, has found the negative response to be an extreme minority, and their invective is greatly outweighed by the reward. She routinely get grateful emails from people of all sizes, people dealing with or recovering from eating disorders, even men. ""It's very humbling."" And it's worth it to Dee to keep putting herself out there in such a public way, no matter the challenges. While it's empowering to look beautiful on the outside, ""Life is too short to be hung up on appearance,"" she says. ""At the end of the day, its just your outer shell -- there's a whole personality underneath that's just waiting to shine. And even if you don't realize how beautiful you are, someone else is out there who thinks you are the most beautiful person in the world."" Even if it's a stranger, looking at you through a screen.","A movement of plus-sized fashion bloggers are redefining beautiful and reclaiming the word ""fat""

"(CNN) -- For actor Bill Oberst Jr., it was an unpaid gig starring in a Web-only video that's just two minutes long. An Emmy and a Webby Award later, he says ""Take This Lollipop"" is the best job he's ever taken. ""It changed my career,"" Oberst said. ""I'm doing feature after feature. I'm doing four in a row right now, and that's all because of the reaction to 'Lollipop'."" The personalized, interactive video took the Web by storm last Halloween. In it, Oberst plays a disturbed-looking stalker who paws through Facebook photos and other information the viewer provides before jumping in a car and driving in a twisted rage toward the address that the user has posted right there on the Internet for anyone to see. As of Wednesday, the video had been ""liked"" on Facebook more than 13.9 million times. Director Jason Zada says it's been watched more than 100 million times total, and its 10 million likes in less than a month made it the fastest-spreading app in Facebook's history, according to Mashable. And now? Like any good horror outing, it's getting a sequel. Zada hopes to launch ""Take This Lollipop 2"" by Halloween. He's started a Kickstarter campaign, hoping that some of the millions of people he freaked out last year will help him do it again. ""The people were such a huge part of making the first one so successful -- there was really nothing else that made it successful other than people talking about it and people writing about it,"" he said. ""Thirteen million peopled 'liked' the original one. If we just got 150,000 of those people to give a dollar to say they liked the first one and want to see a second one ... it's such an interesting concept to see that's all it takes."" ""Lollipop"" clearly touched a nerve. In it, Zada (whose viral-video pedigree began with 2006's interactive ""Elf Yourself"") merged Oberst's disturbing screen persona with the public's mounting concerns about Facebook security and online privacy in general. It would go on to shock even its creators by winning a Daytime Emmy Award for ""New Approaches"" as well as a pair of Webby Awards. ""You always have that thing in your mind where you hope what you're doing is going to be successful, but I never had any clue it would be this successful,"" Zada said. ""Winning the Daytime Emmy was probably the most remote thing I could have put into my head."" Oberst says he sees the video's wide reach in his daily life. ""Particularly if I'm wearing a wife-beater (T-shirt), which is frequent in L.A. because it's hot,"" he said. ""I've actually had kids say, 'Mom, that's the guy who stalked me on Facebook!' The kids think it's funny. The adults are freaked out by it."" Oberst is already a bit of a B-movie regular, with appearances ranging from HBO's ""True Blood"" to the provocatively titled ""Nude Nuns With Big Guns."" But he credits the video with helping him emerge as something of a cult favorite. (""I'm killing a guy in a bathtub today,"" he says by phone during a break in shooting an upcoming feature). ""It became worldwide,"" he said. ""I went from just trying to work to someone who was described, whether accurately or not, as an emerging horror icon on sites in Romania and Russia. I owe Jason and his team a great debt because, basically that's a two-minute reel for what I do on film."" Zada is being understandably tight-lipped about details of the sequel. ""Part of what made the first one really successful was the idea that your friend told you to do this, but really didn't give you too much information,"" he said. ""A lot of the word of mouth was, 'Oh my god, this is the scariest thing I've ever seen,' but a lot of people didn't really tell people what happens before they saw it."" He promises it will again be interactive and be ""bigger"" than the original. ""We want to take it a step further,"" Zada said. ""We think there's an interesting story we're developing that, if you spoiled some of the details, would spoil some of the experience."" He won't even officially confirm whether Oberst will be back, although he quickly acknowledges that he ""couldn't imagine him not being a part of it."" And Kickstarter supporters can be part of the action. Donor levels range from $1 to $10 (which gets you the iconic blue lollipop featured on the original video, sans razor blade) all the way up to a whopping $10,000, at which point the campaign ominously promises ""an extended film experience that begins to infiltrate your real life."" For a more meager $2,500, you can have a photograph of yourself included in the film. ""We wanted to come up with some inventive ways of letting people be a part of it,"" Zada said. ""If, for whatever reason, it ends up being seen by as many people as the first one, you can be part of it.""","Kickstarter campaign launches to make a sequel to viral hit ""Take This Lollipop""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court sided with Congress on Thursday in the high-stakes power struggle over presidential recess appointments, in which officials are placed in top government jobs temporarily without Senate approval. The justices' unanimous ruling on the narrowest of grounds against the Obama administration could invalidate hundreds of decisions by the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency at the center of this legal fight. At issue is whether three people named by President Barack Obama to the board were ineligible to serve because their appointments were made while the Senate was technically in a ""pro forma"" session during the 2011-12 winter holiday break. That meant the mostly empty chamber was convening every three days without any business conducted, and with the sessions lasting only minutes at most. The court majority concluded recess appointments would be valid if those breaks lasted 10 days or more. The Constitution allows a president to fill temporary appointments during a recess, without congressional approval. But more recently, lawmakers have sought to thwart certain appointments by never technically shutting down the Senate. The closely watched constitutional and political confrontation over the practice has accelerated because of partisan gridlock in Congress. Presidential spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that the White House was ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision and said the administration is ""still reviewing it."" The court's opinion will not have an immediate effect, since Democrats controlling the Senate imposed rules making it harder for Republicans to block Obama's nominees. But a change in Senate control after November's midterm elections could renew the disagreements. ""We conclude that the Recess Appointment Clause does not give the President the constitutional authority to make the appointments here at issue,"" Justice Stephen Breyer said. ""We hold that the Senate is in session, and not in recess, when the Senate says that it is in session."" But the court said the executive could use his power to make recess appointments even when the vacancy occurred before the Senate goes on break. To achieve unanimity, the court took a limited approach, avoiding a decision that could have applied to greater set of recess scenarios, thereby further blunting the executive's power. Four conservative justices wanted their colleagues to go farther, and complained the majority ""bends over backwards"" to preserve some of the President's options. That gives both branches some room to claim even a partial victory. Senate officials weigh in . ""I welcome the Supreme Court's important decision today,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said just after the ruling. ""This administration has a tendency to abide by laws that it likes and to disregard those it doesn't."" His Democratic counterpart blamed the GOP for the current fights. ""Since President Obama took office, Senate Republicans have done everything possible to deny qualified nominees from receiving a fair up-or-down vote,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. ""President Obama did the right thing when he made these appointments on behalf of American workers."" While agreeing with the outcome of the narrow question presented, four more conservative justices worried that the ruling would allow the President to retain a good deal of the ""powerful weapon"" of making recess appointments. ""The only remaining practical use for the recess-appointment power is the ignoble one of enabling Presidents to circumvent the Senate's role in the appointment process, which is precisely what happened here,"" Justice Antonin Scalia said from the bench. Other Presidents' recess appointments . Among recent presidents, Ronald Reagan made 240 recess appointments, George H. W. Bush made 77, Bill Clinton made 139, George W. Bush made 171, and Obama has made 32 so far. Gen. (later President) Dwight Eisenhower, Judge (later Justice) Thurgood Marshall, Chief Justice Earl Warren and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan were all recess appointments. Some GOP lawmakers also accused the President of flip-flopping on the issue. When he was a senator, Obama criticized then-President Bush's recess appointment of John Bolton as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. The court's ruling could also put in jeopardy some decisions made by Richard Cordray, who was appointed to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a move also being challenged in a separate lawsuit. Cordray was named the same day as the three National Labor Relations Board appointments, which gave the board a full panel for the first time in a year. The lawsuit leading the to the Supreme Court case was brought by Noel Canning, a family-owned Yakima, Washington, bottling company, which complained the board improperly ruled in favor of Teamsters Local 760 during contract negotiations. Company executives said the board lacked a binding quorum because the recess appointments made by Obama were not legal. How they've kept the Senate in session . Since May 2011, Republicans have been relying on a little-known procedure to keep the Senate in session, even when it was not really conducting any business, in order to stop the President from making those recess appointments. The legal basis comes from a 1993 Department of Justice brief saying the president should act only if the Senate is in official recess more than three days. So, party leaders have arranged for a single Republican lawmaker to show up every three days and gavel the Senate to order, wait around for about 30 seconds, gavel it to a close, then leave. Legal experts have disagreed on both the tactical and timing procedures by the Senate, and whether the president has unilateral authority to override those legislative tactics. The case is NLRB v.

"(CNN) -- Two U.S. Army soldiers were killed Thursday in Afghanistan, the Department of Defense said. Staff Sgt. Benjamin G. Prange, 30, of Hickman, Nebraska, and Pfc. Keith M. Williams, 19, of Visalia, California, were killed by an IED blast in Mirugol Kalay in Kandahar Province, the DOD said. Also on Thursday, Pfc. Donnell A. Hamilton, 20, of Kenosha, Wisconsin, died at Brooke Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, from an illness he contracted in Ghanzi Province in Afghanistan. With combat operations in Afghanistan ending this year, President Barack Obama has announced he plans for almost 10,000 American troops to remain in the country in 2015 if the Afghan government signs a security agreement. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry recently brokered an agreement between the nation's two presidential candidates -- Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani -- to accept the outcome of an audit of the recent election. Preliminary results from the June runoff showed Ghani in the lead, but Abdullah alleged massive election fraud. The inauguration of the new president, originally scheduled for the first week of August, will be postponed while the votes are recounted. Violence still flares. On July 15, a car bomb exploded in a busy market in eastern Afghanistan, killing more than 40 people, officials said, in what is said to be the deadliest attack in the country this year.","Two soldiers were killed by IED in Kandahar Province on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- A fierce weather system -- featuring baseball-sized hail and multiple tornadoes -- ripped through Colorado on Wednesday afternoon, spurring warnings to people in and around Denver to take cover. The frenzy was tied to a dangerous super cell thunderstorm that, in addition to heaps of hail, produced a number of twisters, according to storm chasers on the scene. The National Weather Service said there were reported tornado touchdowns in Watkins, East Denver, Aurora, Byers and Leader. One witness, Jeff Piotrowski, said shortly after 3 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) that he had personally seen five tornadoes on the ground not far from Denver International Airport. ""This thing is spinning up multiple tornadoes,"" Piotrowski told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""There were tornadoes on the outer ring of the circulation, ... and then there's the main tornado vortex closer to the storm."" One of those got within about a mile of the Denver airport, only to move past it, according to Piotrowski. The airport wasn't struck directly, though it was certainly affected. Six planes in Denver-based Frontier Airlines' fleet had to be taken out of service due to hail damage, company spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said. And the airport's Twitter feed reported 38 flights were diverted and average delays of 90 minutes, not to mention the ordeal of removing hail and water from the airfield. iReporter: 'This is the first time I've seen anything like this' While those delays subsided, by later Wednesday night travelers were dealing with a different problem: Sections of Tower Road and nearby streets were closed due to flooding, according to a Commerce City press release. Likewise, the city of Denver and neighboring municipalities appear to have escaped without significant damage. The heart of the system then moved into more rural areas. Even if these areas escape without severe wind damage, the hail -- some as big as baseballs, according to storm chaser Mark ""Storm"" Farnik -- made an impact in more ways than one. The weather service's Boulder branch retweeted a photo of about 6 inches of accumulated hail in Denver's Green Valley Ranch, plus another showing Highway 470 restricted to one lane because of the hard, white stuff. For most of the evening, much of northern Colorado -- as well as several counties in Wyoming -- were under tornado watches. Those advisories later expired. The storms continued to produce heavy rain and relatively small hail that contributed to minor street flooding in places like Boulder, Loveland and Fort Collins, according to the National Weather Service.","NEW: Airline: Hail damages 6 Frontier planes; delays throughout Denver airport .

"(CNN) -- The oil and gas industry's injection of wastewater deep into the Earth is ""a likely contributing factor"" to the 50% increase in Oklahoma earthquakes since October, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The jump in temblors significantly increases the chance for a damaging quake -- 5.5 magnitude or greater -- in the Great Plains state, the federal agency said. ""As a result of the increased number of small and moderate shocks, the likelihood of future, damaging earthquakes has increased for central and north-central Oklahoma,"" the USGS said Monday. The increase in earthquakes ""do not seem to be due to typical, random fluctuations in natural seismicity rates,"" a recent USGS statistical analysis found. Rather, a finding by the USGS and the Oklahoma Geological Survey ""indicates that a likely contributing factor to the increase in earthquakes is wastewater disposal by injection into deep geologic formations,"" the USGS said. The Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association, however, urged a wait-and-see approach in judging the USGS's assertions. ""Because crude oil and natural gas is produced in 70 of Oklahoma's 77 counties, any seismic activity within the state is likely to occur near oil and natural gas activity. The OIPA and the oil and gas industry as a whole support the continued study of Oklahoma's increased seismic activity, but a rush to judgment provides no clear understanding of the causes,"" the industry group said. Between last October and April 14, the state experienced 183 quakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater, the USGS and Oklahoma Geological Survey said. That is an increase from the state's long-term average from 1978 to 2008 of only two magnitude 3.0 or larger quakes per year. ""The water injection can increase underground pressures, lubricate faults and cause earthquakes -- a process known as injection-induced seismicity,"" the USGS said. ""Much of this wastewater is a byproduct of oil and gas production and is routinely disposed of by injection into wells specifically designed and approved for this purpose."" To better gauge the increased quakes, the USGS and Oklahoma officials have added monitoring stations, which now stand at 15 permanent facilities and 17 temporary stations, the agency said.

"(CNN) -- At 42, Richard Swanson was without work, without kids at home, without a mortgage, but with a lot of time to ponder what matters. ""It gives you time to think of what you want out of life,"" he said in a YouTube video. One thing he wanted, he said, was to watch soccer's World Cup, scheduled for summer 2014 in Brazil. ""I should just walk to the World Cup. ... Just take off out the door and start hoofing it and head south,"" he said in the video. And then, ""Since I'm going to the World Cup, I should honor it by dribbling a soccer ball."" That would be more than 6,700 miles of dribbling, from his home in Seattle to Sao Paulo, Brazil. He'd dribble a special, durable soccer ball, designed to give kids in poor countries something that they could play with for a long time, something that wouldn't break on rocky playgrounds or fields with sharp, thorny brush. People following his journey could donate to promote the program, One World Futbol Project said. He started May 1. His journey ended suddenly Tuesday when a pickup truck struck and killed him on U.S. 101 in Lincoln City, Oregon, about 250 miles south of Seattle. His death was announced on a Facebook page, Breakaway Brazil, he set up to document his trek. ""It is with a heavy heart to notify you that Richard Swanson passed on this morning. His team, family, friends, and loved ones will miss him and love him dearly. You made it to Brazil in our hearts, Richard. Team Richard,"" the post said. Supporters want the ball Swanson was dribbling to be in Brazil. Police said it was recovered from the accident scene. ""Someone should see to it that his ball makes it to the World Cup,"" Megan Cruz wrote on the page for Breakaway Brazil. ""Maybe the first 'play' could be done with his ball, then returned to the family."" ""First kick at 2014 WC should be with his blue ball,"" Peda Knezevic wrote under Swanson's YouTube video. One World Futbol Project noted Swanson's death in a tweet and on its website. ""We are extremely saddened to hear the news about Richard. He was a very inspiring man, our thoughts are with his family,"" it said via Twitter. Police are investigating the accident, and the driver of the pickup that hit Swanson was cooperating, according to reports from CNN affiliates KPTV-TV and KATU-TV in Oregon. The Breakaway Brazil Facebook and the YouTube pages were filled Wednesday with tributes to Swanson from soccer fans around the world. ""Please know his death was not in vain, his story reached all corners of the world,"" wrote Rena Gerlach from Portland, Oregon. ""Your name will never be forgotten by my dear Brazil,"" wrote Vanessa GonÃ§alves. There were postings in German and Portuguese. And posts from Japan and Canada.

"(CNN) -- Ashlee Tomsche walked into the rec center with trepidation. Images of six-pack abs and neon sports bras from the Zumba infomercials she had watched flashed through her mind. I'm going to look like a complete fool, she thought. With her head down, she walked into the aerobics room and took a spot in the back. She was 21 and weighed 331 pounds. Zumba is a Latin-inspired dance fitness class that blends booty shaking with international music and an intense calorie burn. Since the company launched in 2001, Zumba classes have spread to 14 million people in 150 countries, according to Zumba.com. Tomsche's first class was hard. She had to stop several times to catch her breath. But she came back the next day. And then again the next. A year later, she had dropped 123 pounds, six dress sizes and more than 10 inches from her waist. ""It's just crazy,"" the Arkansas City, Kansas, resident says. ""We're having too much fun."" Comfort food . Tomsche was an overweight child, but it wasn't until her best friend committed suicide when she was 16 that she started packing on the pounds. ""It really hit me hard, and I turned to food for comfort,"" she remembers. ""It was always there."" She indulged in chips and ice cream, and drank soda by the gallon. She would eat an entire pizza by herself in one sitting. Every time she binged on junk food, she felt sick and swore she'd never do it again. But overeating had already taken its toll. She didn't go out because she wasn't confident in her body. Instead she came home right after work to snack in front of the TV. Once in a while she would hit the gym to walk on the treadmill, but it bored her more than empowering her. ""I knew I needed to lose weight, but I never knew where to start,"" she says. ""I would try something for a few months and give up."" Then she found Zumba. Just dance . Instructor Maria Venegas remembers when Tomsche first tried her Zumba class. Tomsche wore baggy clothing and seemed unsure in her body. ""She would go and sit down about a third (of the) way into class,"" Venegas says. ""But she would get right back up and continue to do what she could."" Venegas teaches seven Zumba classes a week in Arkansas City in addition to working as an office manager and professional photographer. ""I used to think it was my kids that kept me young,"" the single mother of two says. ""But it has been my venture to become a Zumba instructor that has (been) the fountain of youth, for myself and many others."" Venegas creates her own routines, incorporating music from popular artists such as Michael Jackson and Ne-Yo into her classes. In a typical hourlong class, participants burn between 300 and 650 calories. ""Every class is always different,"" Tomsche says. ""I'm addicted."" Tomsche loves Zumba so much she didn't even realize at first she was losing weight. But after four months, she had dropped 20 pounds and was getting compliments from her classmates. The attention encouraged her to keep going. ""Now (she) walks in with a big smile ... shoulders back and head up high,"" Venegas says. Small town, big inspiration . Tomsche tracks her daily calories on the MyFitnessPal app and drinks protein shakes for breakfast. Giving up junk food has been hard, but she splurges occasionally on thin-crust pizza or Nutella on whole wheat waffles. Tomsche does Zumba five to six times a week and tries to stay active the rest of the day. Her hard work has paid off -- she weighs 208 pounds and wears a size 14 pants. ""The simplest things in life have become easier,"" Tomsche wrote in a CNN iReport submission. ""I don't feel like I can't breathe when I bend over to tie my shoes. I'm not out of breath when I walk up and down the halls at work, and even sleeping is easier since I don't have all that excess weight pressing down on me."" Venegas offered to do a professional photo shoot with Tomsche in January, and they posted the pictures online. Venegas' Zumba classes quickly filled up. She says Tomsche has inspired their small community. Tomsche is just happy she's gotten her smile back. ""I never thought coming from a town of 12,000 (people) that I would be an inspiration for anyone,"" she says. ""It's just given me so much confidence in myself."" Her advice for others who are struggling to lose weight? Find a workout that you love. ""It can be done,"" she says simply. Have you lost weight?

"(CNN) -- Fancy stripping off before a flight and getting sweaty with fellow passengers? Finnair think you might like to and has backed the idea by adding a sauna to its new premium lounge in Helsinki Airport. Airline lounges are prime ways for airlines to promote their brand and showcase all the luxury and service frills they can muster, but with a traditional unisex sauna, Finnair has upped the ante. The airline has gone big on the Nordic theme throughout the new lounge that opens later this year. Open to passengers holding Finnair's platinum and gold cards, the 407-square meter space is decorated with a variety of Finnish designed homeware from the likes of Marimekko, Iittala Ultima Thule and Eero Saarinen, while video projections reflect the time of day and season. In a country where there's around one sauna for every three people, incorporating one into the new lounge seemed a natural thing to do . ""Our aim was to create a high-quality, even emotional experience for Finnair's demanding clients,"" says designer Vertti Kivi. ""Different zones for work, refreshment, silence or bathing are unified with a light Scandinavian design touch, creating a space that clients won't forget."" The sight of fellow passengers in the nude in a tiny room heated to nearly 100 degrees Celsius could be part of that unforgettable experience, but perhaps not the kind of memory some would want to retain from a business trip. Traditionally saunas in Finland are taken naked, but guests are ""recommended"" to use towels, states the airline. Finnair did have an airport sauna before, but according to the airline, it closed over two years ago because it wasn't financially viable. With an expansion to Helsinki Airport, the airline believe it will be a greater success this time.","Finnair adds a sauna to its new airport lounge in Helsinki .

"(CNN) -- When I ""beat"" cancer the first time, I was excited. My daughter was on her way to remission as well, and we were going to be a normal family again. It was almost over. Then Saoirse's cancer came back with a vengeance, and she was taken from us. I wanted to trade places with her, but I was better. I was in remission, and I had to learn to live again, even though my baby girl had died. So I did just that. I pushed forward. I started a nonprofit neuroblastoma foundation in Saoirse's honor, helped my husband start a business called CareAline Products to distribute products I had made for her when she was sick, and gave birth to our second child. Mom sews a new dream after toddler's death . Life seemed to be moving in the right direction. I felt great, and while there was always a little voice telling me remission wasn't a guarantee, I thought that I had made all the necessary changes in my lifestyle to keep me cancer-free forever. Then, in one instant of excruciating pain, that belief that everything was going to be OK was gone. A kidney stone sent me to the ER. When the doctor came back with the CT results, I wasn't expecting the words that would come out of her mouth: . ""You have a 4-millimeter kidney stone. But you also have some swollen lymph nodes next to your aorta. They were flagged by the radiologist because of your history."" The world went silent, which is a feat, considering I was sitting in a busy ER. I'm pretty sure I stared dumbfounded at the doctor for at least a minute, unmoving. Lymph nodes. Swollen. Those words stuck in my head. While I did my best to believe that follow-up tests would be negative, in the back of my mind, I knew. The cancer was back. I was sent home to pass my kidney stone, and to start the excruciating process of figuring out what the heck was going on inside my body. First came the scans -- CT and PET. Then a biopsy. Waiting for test results takes an extreme emotional toll. With every day that passed I grew more anxious, and more unfocused. The news came at lunchtime on a Tuesday six weeks after that fateful ER trip. ""They are calling it a Hodgkin's lymphoma,"" the doctor said. All I could say was, ""OK."" I was numb. Then frustration set in, quickly followed by extreme annoyance. How could this be happening again? I didn't have time to deal with cancer. I had a foundation to run, a business to help with, and first and foremost, an 8-month-old to take care of. When I set out to fix something, I do it right. I think this is why my cancer relapse hit me so hard. It means I have to go back to the drawing board and start again. It's a feeling of failure that is hard to overcome. I have tried not to let my family and friends see my disappointment, but it has been almost impossible to hide. This time, cancer isn't the unknown beast it was the first time I was diagnosed. This time cancer was the nagging neighbor who finally moved and put their house on the market and then decided to come back instead of paying closing costs. Relapse is a fear of the known. I know what chemo feels like. I know the nausea, the hair loss, the numbness, the fatigue, the burning veins and the pain. I know that chemo can take me from feeling great to feeling like crap in less than four hours. I know what high-dose chemo does to a patient whose only wish is to live a little bit longer. I've seen quality of life stripped away for a chance at a few more months, and the ever-diminishing chance of a cure. With that knowledge came a major decision: Should I give in and allow myself to be thrown back into the chaos of toxic therapy -- or defy the fear and find a better way? During the six weeks I waited for my test results, I started to think about, talk about, and research different treatment options. I wasn't comfortable doing chemotherapy again, as I knew the treatment would be much more intense and toxic than what I had already been through. When relapse was confirmed, my general practitioner told me about homeopathic cancer therapy. I did more research, and made more phone calls. It just felt right. My doctors are on board, especially since I have a slow-growing disease. While some may not understand my choice to forgo conventional treatment, this time around I'm determined not to be scared into toxic therapy. This is a chance to take back control of my body. I'm determined to beat cancer, and I know that I am strong enough to do so. After all, I did it once before. The opinions in this article are solely those of Kezia Fitzgerald.","Kezia Fitzgerald went into remission from Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo pledged his future to Real Madrid as he signed a new five-year deal Sunday which ties him to the Spanish giants until 2018. The Portuguese international will reportedly become the highest paid footballer in the world but the club did not give details in making the official announcement. Ronaldo, who had been linked with a return to the English Premier League with his former club Manchester United, revealed a verbal agreement had been in place with Real Madrid since the end of last season. ""It's a very special day for me,"" he said. ""For me it's as if today were my first day here. I'm always going to give my best for this shirt. I hope that I'm here until I retire. This is a great club."" With Ronaldo's current contract set to run out in 2015, the renewed deal is a considerable coup for Real president Florentino Perez. ""Today is a magnificent day for Real Madrid,"" he said. ""The best player in the world knows that this is his home forever. A home that demands the most of him, but also loves him the most."" The 28-year-old Ronaldo signed for Real from Manchester United in 2009 for a then world record fee of $130,000. He has justified the fee with an incredible scoring rate of a goal per game for Los Blancos, helping them to the La Liga title in the 2011/12 campaign. Last season saw Barcelona reclaim the Spanish title and Real Madrid were disappointingly knocked out in the semifinal of the Champions League by Borussia Dortmund. It led to speculation that he may be on the move, but under new coach Carlo Ancelotti, Real have made an unbeaten start to the current season. Ronaldo has been joined at Real by Gareth Bale, whose transfer from Tottenham Hotspur broke the record fee paid for his new teammate. The pair played together for the first time Saturday, with Bale scoring Real's equalizer at Villarreal before Ronaldo put them 2-1 ahead. The home side equalized in a 2-2 draw to take some of the gloss off Bale's much trumpeted debut, but Real fans will take comfort in Ronaldo's renewed commitment. ""For me it's as if today were my first day here. I'm always going to give my best for this shirt,"" he said.","Cristiano Ronaldo agrees new five year deal at Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- Who doesn't like getting those retail discounts or free gift coupons from their favorite stores? But did you know there were strings attached, invisible eyes tracking your every consumer move? And there's little you can do to stop it. We want to do something about that. Businesses have long sought to attract and retain customers by recording and analyzing your shopping and lifestyle habits. To do so, they often rely on ""data brokers"" -- companies that collect and share our personal information and label us based on what they learn. And they do this mostly without our knowledge. That fashionable handbag you found on sale? They know about it. That great deal you got on the BBQ grill from the hardware store? They're tracking that too. And that box of Cheerios? They already assumed you were going to buy that before you even entered the store. The data broker industry has been booming in recent years, due to new technologies that enable the collection of massive quantities of our personal information. Because of the sheer volume of data we leave in our wake when we shop, browse the web, order a magazine, or post to social media sites, we are largely giving them all this valuable information. Data brokers scoop up the digital breadcrumbs we leave as we shop in stores and online, and apply ""big data"" analytical tools to predict where we're going, what we'll buy, and what we'll do -- sometimes even before we know ourselves what we'll buy next. There's no question that the personal information that data brokers sell to retailers, financial firms, hotels, airlines and other businesses can provide benefits to consumers and our growing digital economy. It can help direct goods and services that are tailored to our interests and assisting businesses to combat fraud by verifying consumers' identities. They also take this information and use it to lump us into various, shorthand categories like ""Affluent Baby Boomer"" and ""Bible Lifestyle."" But if a data broker categorizes you as an ""Urban Scrambler,"" meaning a low-income minority, are you more likely to receive an offer for a payday loan than a credit card? What are the implications of being labeled as ""financially challenged?"" Will it mean you are cut off from being offered the same goods and services, at the same prices, as your neighbors? Do you want a company to know that you have diabetes, high cholesterol, or another medical condition as long as it is willing to pay the going rate for health data? Most Americans don't even know that data brokers exist, let alone that they collect and trade a staggering amount of our personal data. Brokers operate invisibly, buying and selling data about us without interacting directly with us. Too few offer easy ways for us to access our information or opt-out of their system of data collection. The Federal Trade Commission, a bipartisan agency that works to protect consumers, is seeking to shed light on this largely unknown industry. The FTC has just released a detailed study of nine data brokers. We found that data brokers collect billions of pieces of data on nearly every American consumer, often merging online and offline information. Data brokers are also making potentially sensitive inferences about consumers -- about their health, financial status, and ethnic backgrounds. And consumers have little if any window into this process, let alone meaningful control or choice about how their data is shared among businesses. This week, the FTC has called on Congress to improve the transparency of the data broker industry, and to provide consumers more control over their personal information. We also recommend that Congress require data brokers to create a centralized website, among other measures, so that consumers can access their own data and opt out of data collection and retention. I also believe data brokers should be required to take reasonable steps to ensure consumer information is not used for unlawful purposes, such as to illegally discriminate. We need better transparency into how data brokers collect and use our personal information to help ensure that we not go down a path that leads to unfair exclusion, but rather one that widens opportunities for all consumers.

"(CNN) -- Google on Thursday released its latest candy-themed mobile operating system: Android 4.4, more deliciously known as Kit Kat. The system will launch immediately on Google's new Nexus 5 phone and then roll out to other Nexus devices, the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One, in the next few weeks. Nexus devices are Google's flagship line of phones and tablets, running the newest and purest form of Android and available without contracts. The Nexus 5, manufactured by LG, is built to work internationally on a variety of bands and with whatever local SIM card you pick up, though Verizon's band is still not supported. Physically, the 5-inch Nexus is a bit thinner and lighter than the previous generation, while packing a faster Snapdragon 800 processor. It has optical image stabilization and a new HDR camera feature for combining multiple exposures into a single photo, lightening up dark areas and bringing details back to images blown out by a flash. The Nexus 5 is available online today in 10 countries and will be available in retail stores like Best Buy. It's a wider rollout than for previous generations of Nexus phones. The 16 GB version will cost $349 without a contract and the 32 GB version will go for $399, also without a contract. The phone also will be the first to have the new Kit Kat features, many of which attempt to break down the walls between web, search, apps and communication tools. The phone app -- widely neglected since Android smartphones first came out -- gets more search power in Kit Kat, pulling in search results for business as well as your usual roster of contacts. Incoming calls from business are recognized automatically in caller ID, while pulling data from the same database that powers Google Maps. Kit Kat also adds support for third-party cloud services like Box so you can see files stored on the device and in the cloud. Google Hangouts absorbs SMS and MMS messages, so your chats, video calls and texts are all together in one place. Google Now, the company's app for serving up answers to questions you haven't even asked yet, is adding new categories. It can deduce your interests based on your web searches -- say, ""The Walking Dead,"" or corgis -- and add a card to Google Now with the latest information about those interests. If there's a specific site you check a lot that is only sporadically updated, Google Now might alert you to new posts when they happen. It's also tapping the power of crowds. Google Now knows your location, and Google knows what people at that exact spot during that time are most likely to search. For example, someone standing in front of Old Faithful at Yellowstone might search for a schedule of when the geyser is going to erupt. Google Now will automatically show you the times without your searching. Google Search on Kit Kat is not limited to content from the web. Google is starting to index content deep inside of individual apps, so if you search for a recipe it might show a web page and a link to a cooking app you already have installed. For now, it will only work with installed apps, but Google says its working on adding support for apps in the Google Play store, which could be a clever way to sell more apps. Kit Kat is also Google's attempt to address one the bigger problems plaguing Android: OS fragmentation. Low-end Android devices are big sellers in emerging markets like China and India, but because of their limited memories and pokey processors, they typically run older versions of the Android operating system, like Gingerbread. The decision of what version of Android to ship on these devices is up the manufacturers. But Google is trying hard to make its newest OS more appealing for these markets by upgrading it to use less processor power and memory.","Google is rolling out its new Android mobile operating system, called Kit Kat .

"(CNN) -- Icy beers, empty beaches. It's a compelling image, but it captures only a feeble percentage of the diversity and excellence that imbues one of the most incredible countries in the world. Here are 10 things Mexico does better than anywhere else. Celebrating death . Plenty of cultures do ancestor worship. But who else turns the commemoration of their dearly departed into an annual fiesta of art, food and community? On November 1, aka the Day of the Dead, Mexicans put together ofrendas (shrines) for loved ones who have passed away. Every ofrenda includes pictures of the deceased, food, drinks, skull-shaped candies, candles and cempasuchil, the Aztec marigold or flower of the dead. The belief is that souls of children come back to earth to visit family and friends on November 1 and the souls of adults do the same on November 2. Day of the Dead festivals take place across Mexico. Three of the most elaborate are held in San Andrés Mixquic (in Tláhuac, Mexico City), Patzcuaro, Michoacán and Janitzio, Michoacán. Horn sections . From symphony orchestras to oompah bands to soul and R&B horn sections, everyone loves a blast of brass. Whereas most countries tend to save their horns for parties and special occasions, however, Mexico kicks out the brass jams on a daily basis. Where else can you hear tubas -- actual tubas! -- laying down bass lines on the radio every hour of the week? It all comes down to bandas, the heart of both traditional and popular genres of Mexican music. Bandas are typically comprised of 10 to 20 musicians who play brass instruments, woodwinds and various percussion. Every Mexico traveler is charmed by mariachi, but bandas are a part of several broader genres, the most characteristic being ranchera, quebradita and corridos. Tequila . Mexico's national liquor is a worldwide bar standard, with exports to 96 countries. But don't come to Mexico expecting to impress locals by chugging a syrupy sweet margarita or knocking down manly shots all night. Tequila is meant to be sipped and savored, like fine whiskey, which, as any Mexican will tell you, the best tequila can compete with. You can get a taste of the top-shelf stuff on the Tequila Trail, which includes some of the country's most renowned distilleries. Alternates are The Tequila Express tour operated by Casa Herradura and the Jose Cuervo Express tour. Curing hangovers . Mexican parties are notorious for going berserk in the blink of a bleary eye. That, of course, leads to a familiar disaster the following morning. Fortunately, Mexico's kitchens spring to life with the best hangover grub on the planet. Wake up, guzzle water then inhale some spicy chilaquiles, carnitas (pork) or barbacoa (sheep) tacos with hot sauce and plenty of revitalizing grease -- maybe slam a light breakfast beer if you're in really rough shape -- and you'll be back making requests from the band by nightfall. Double entendre (Albur) Called ""albur"" in Spanish, double entendre isn't just a linguistic trick for Mexicans, it's an art form requiring a nimble mind and the ability to convey smart but subtle messages, often laced with sexual or R-rated undertones. Many languages, of course, employ veiled connotations and witty wordplay. But albur is so important in Mexico that there's a national tournament to crown the best alburero. The current champ is Lourdes Ruiz, who's won the competition every year since 1997, defeating men and women. She even teaches albur courses. Still not convinced Mexicans take double entendre more seriously than anyone else? What other country has a day devoted to the subtle intricacies of its language? In Mexico, Albur's Day is celebrated on March 1. Diplomado de Albures Finos (Course of Fine/Classy Albures) classes are held at the Galería José María Velasco (Peralvillo 55, colonia Morelos, Tepito, Mexico City); free admission; participants receive a diploma. Catholicism . Vatican City does a pretty fair job as the center of the faith and it has some decent paintings on its ceiling. But its population of 800 souls isn't exactly staggering. Mexico, by contrast, ranks second in the world for number of Catholics (Brazil is first, the Philippines third) and, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico, 83.9% of the Mexicans are Catholic. Nothing says ""Mexican Catholic"" like a reverence for the country's seemingly endless manifestations of the Virgin Mary. Which may be why the priest Miguel Hidalgo carried a symbolic flag of Guadalupe when he led the opening stages of the Mexican War of Independence in 1810. Our Lady of Guadalupe is the most venerated Virgin in Mexico, maybe the world. The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City is also one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Mexico, reportedly the most visited Marian shrine in the world. Each December 12, about 5 million pilgrims from across Mexico visit the Basilica to thank the Virgin for her favors or to ask for a miracle. Basilica of Our Lady of Gaudalupe, Plaza de las Americas 1, Col. Villa de Guadalupe, Delegación Gustavo A. Madero, Mexico City; +52 55 5118 0500 . Quick lunches . Known around the country as Vitamin T, tacos, tortas, tamales and tostadas are part of the everyday life. Mexicans are constantly on the go, so it's no wonder puestos and changarros (food stands) can be found on practically every corner. It doesn't matter if you're in the subway, leaving school or taking a lunch break away from the office -- Mexico's streets offer endless options for a fast and delicious meal cooked right in front of you with super-fresh ingredients. Soap operas . In 1958, Telesistema Mexicano produced ""Senda Prohibida"" (""Forbidden Path""), the first Mexican telenovela (soap opera). Fifty-six years later, its successor Televisa has produced a whopping 740 telenovelas. The formula hasn't changed much. A man and woman fall in love but, for tragic reasons, can't be together. After overcoming obstacles they finally get married. Fifteen years after exporting its first soap opera, ""Los Ricos Tambien Lloran"" (""The Rich Cry Too""), Televisa has found a rich market outside Mexico. Of all countries that export soap operas, Mexico ships out the most, carving niches in other Spanish-speaking countries, as well as China, the Philippines, Israel and Saudi Arabia. (Link in Spanish.) Televisa isn't the only network producing successful telenovelas. TV Azteca and Argos Comunicación also create top-notch weepers. Wrestling costumes . Professional wrestling (lucha libre) may be more Hollywood north of the border, and grittier in other countries, but nowhere is it as full of pathos as in Mexico. Those hilarious/spooky masks aren't just fun to look at, they're a major part of the drama. Removing one from an opponent's head is one of the greatest triumphs and most thrilling moments in lucha libre. Matches are held at Arena Mexico in Mexico City on Tuesdays (7:30 p.m.), Fridays (8:30 p.m.) and Sundays (5 p.m.). Tickets can be purchased from Ticketmaster. Polite lies . Mexicans' deep fear of appearing rude has given us a bred-in-the-bone aversion to uttering the word ""no."" Instead -- and unfortunately for those unfamiliar with the rules of courtesy here -- we've developed a talent for white lies that allow us to say yes to fulfilling any request. Even if we can't do anything about it. White lies can be as clichéd as ""the dog ate my homework"" or as morbid as ""my beloved great aunt has suddenly developed pancreatic cancer."" But the granddaddy of polite lies is ""ahorita."" ""Ahorita"" literally means ""right now,"" but it's almost never that. When a Mexican tells you they'll do something ""ahorita,"" be prepared to take a seat, because the wait can be long. Think of ahorita as the Mexican art of procrastination -- it's been passed from generation to generation -- a term that can mean anything from ""in 10 minutes"" to ""in three weeks."" Ahorita's cousin in crime is ""I'm on my way."" This really means, ""I'm on my way to finishing this TV show, maybe getting off the couch, calling my sister, taking a shower, grabbing a snack and actually leaving home to meet you."" You've been warned -- we're great at it! What do you love most about Mexico? Leave a comment. Karla Villegas Gama is a Mexican journalist who writes for CNN International, CNNMéxico and CNN en Español.

"(CNN) -- The jury of Iran's Press Court on Sunday found the Tehran bureau chief for Reuters guilty of publishing lies and negatively influencing public opinion. Press TV, a state media agency, reported a jury member said Reuters was ""found guilty of propagating against the Islamic Republic and disseminating false information to disturb public opinion."" Parisa Hafezi is Reuters' bureau chief in Tehran. She referred CNN to Thompson Reuters, based in London, for a statement. In a story about the verdict on its website, Reuters said, ""We understand that the jury has stated its view and we now await the court's ruling. We do not intend to comment further until a decision is issued."" Press TV said a judge will make his final ruling in October, and the news agency can appeal the decision. The controversy stems from a Reuters video showing women clad head to toe in black, running up walls and flipping backwards, and diving and rolling over swords held at waist heights. A Culture Ministry official accused Reuters of calling the martial arts students terrorists, when in fact they are ""university students and housewives"" who ""engaged in this sport because of their love for the sport."" Reuters acknowledged the video report in February ""contained an error"" and said the headline was changed after a complaint. The story's headline, ""Thousands of female Ninjas train as Iran's assassins,"" was corrected to read ""Three thousand women Ninjas train in Iran,"" Reuters said in a statement. Reuters also apologized for the error, the news agency said. According to Fars, a semiofficial Iranian news agency, the lawsuit was filed by ""Iranian Women Ninjas."" Eleven Reuters staff members in Tehran were told to hand in their press cards over the incident, Reuters said in April. ""We acknowledge this error occurred and regard it as a very serious matter,"" editor-in-chief Stephen J. Adler said, adding that officials at the company ""conducted an internal review and have taken appropriate steps to prevent a recurrence."" The press court was created in February 2011. An Iranian official said it was necessary because of developments in mass media and ""special media crimes.""

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- An Indian army trooper gunned down two of his colleagues with his service rifle in the frontier Poonch district of Indian-administered Kashmir on Sunday before turning the gun on himself. ""Senior army officers have rushed to the spot to investigate,"" an Indian defense spokesman said. ""The army has also ordered a court of inquiry to ascertain the facts,"" defense spokesman Col. Manish Mehta told CNN. This is the second fratricidal incident in Indian-administered Kashmir this year. In February, five troopers were shot dead by a colleague before he killed himself. Senior security force officers attribute the problem to stress because of long duty hours. Several remedial measures -- including granting periodic leaves, bringing in counselors and providing recreational facilities -- have been put in place. Kashmir is a mountainous region that has long been the subject of dispute between India and Pakistan. Both sides keep large numbers of troops in the region. Since 1989, India has also been fighting against a violent separatist movement in the mainly Muslim area it controls, a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people.","Indian army trooper uses service rifle to kill fellow troopers and himself .

"(CNN) -- Call it an extreme boot camp, your last desperate attempt to drag your kid away from video games or just yet another reason to visit one of the world's seven natural wonders. Professional adventurer/survivor/""gross eats"" expert Bear Grylls announced the expansion of his Survival Academy into Africa. The Survival Academy currently runs courses in the United Kingdom and the United States teaching advanced and beginner self-rescue skills to outdoor adventure enthusiasts. Set 10 minutes away from Victoria Falls on the Stanley & Livingstone Private Game Reserve in Zimbabwe, the first African Bear Grylls Survival Academy will feature land and water survival tasks and a final wilderness expedition to put the new skills to use. Grylls is familiar with the area -- it's where he had a parachuting accident as a young soldier. He was told he would never walk again after breaking his back in two places in the fall. A year after the accident, the young Brit, then 23, became one of the youngest people to climb Everest. Designed by the ""Man vs. Wild"" host, the new African course is slated to launch January 2014 and will be run by a team of ex-military/ex-marine survival experts, all of whom have worked with Grylls on the ""Man vs. Wild"" TV shows and have backgrounds in mountaineering and other outdoors expertise. When he's not busy with other engagements, the adventurer plans to make himself available when he can to teach and assist courses. ""So many people have asked me over the years where they can learn extreme, practical survival -- the type that requires spirit, determination and the skills to self-rescue against the odds, in some of the harshest terrain around,"" said Grylls in a media statement. ""So it is with great pride that we can now finally launch the Bear Grylls Survival Academy in Africa to be able to share some of these skills and what it really means to be able to look after yourself when the chips are down. Oh and it may hurt a little."" He's not kidding. The list of skills that participants will be learning include fire lighting, emergency shelter building, knife skills, remote medical trauma, rappelling, tyrolean traverses, extreme weather survival and white-water rafting down the Zambezi River. And of course, no Bear Grylls-branded survival course would be complete without a ""Gross Eat"" challenge -- lucky participants will be foraging for grubs and rodents.","Man vs. Wild host to launch Survival Academy in Zimbabwe in January .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton wants Americans to believe that she made difficult decisions as secretary of state. That's the premise of her new book, ""Hard Choices."" Somehow, I suspect that if Clinton had a do-over for this week's CNN town hall, she might choose not to field a hard question from Francisco Gonzalez. A professor at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, Gonzales asked America's former top diplomat about President Obama's record of removing the undocumented and splitting up families with such efficiency that, as Gonzales noted, many Hispanics call Obama the ""deporter in chief."" He asked what Clinton would do differently. The likely 2016 presidential candidate started by declaring her support for ""comprehensive immigration reform"" because undocumented immigrants who are ""raising families and working hard and contributing to our country deserve a path to citizenship."" So far, so good. She went on: ""I also think that we have to understand the difficulty that President Obama finds himself in because there are laws that impose certain obligations on him."" Clinton doesn't seem to understand how much discretion the executive branch has -- in immigration enforcement -- to set policy, shape priorities, and decide who stays or goes. After arguing with immigration reform advocates from 2009 to 2011 that he was powerless to stop deportations, Obama himself -- in a gesture intended to woo Hispanic voters during the 2012 election -- flexed his executive power when he announced a change in policy by the Department of Homeland Security that allowed some young undocumented immigrants to avoid deportations and obtain work permits. Under Obama, DHS imposed quotas for apprehensions, The Washington Post reported, and roped local police officers into enforcing immigration laws as a force multiplier. The executive branch wasn't some spectator to the deportation juggernaut; it was the driving force. Shouldn't a former member of the Cabinet know this? Clinton also said that it was her understanding that ""the numbers have been moderating in part as the Department of Homeland Security and other law enforcement officials understood that separating children from families -- I mean, the horror of a father or a mother going to work and being picked up and immediately whisked away and children coming home from school to an empty house and nobody can say where their mother or father is -- that is just not who we are as Americans."" Apparently, Clinton doesn't know many immigration lawyers. The dozen or so that I know -- who give me updates about their battles to stop clients from being deported -- would not agree that the numbers of deportations are ""moderating."" There are still just under 400,000 per year. Wrapping up her answer, she went on to say: ""We need to show humanity with respect to people who are working, contributing right now. And deporting them, leaving their children alone or deporting an adolescent, doing anything that is so contrary to our core values, just makes no sense."" Yet, as secretary of state, Clinton sat at the Cabinet table for four years alongside Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano -- who went before Congress to brag about the number of deportations and promise to raise it. And she didn't say anything then? You know, in defense of humanity? Right about then, Clinton strayed off message. When CNN's Christiane Amanpour asked her what she would do about the tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors from Central America who are coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, Clinton at first tried to duck the question by talking about everything from violence in Central America to the need to provide emergency care to children who cross the border. Fortunately, Amanpour pursued an answer. After asking the question -- whether these children should stay or be sent back home -- four different times, she finally got one. ""Well,"" Clinton said, ""they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back. But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families."" It's not that simple. According to media reports, many of these young people came to the United States to be reunited with parents and other family members. What do we do with them? Separate more families? Didn't Clinton herself just say that this approach ""makes no sense""? Finally, having painted herself into a corner, she took a hard line. Opinion: Does Hillary Clinton have to be so boring? ""We have to send a clear message: Just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay,"" she said. ""So, we don't want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey."" What world is Clinton living in? When a child crosses the border, of course he or she gets to stay. That has long been the unspoken policy of U.S. immigration officials, under administrations in both parties. They can't just send these minors back across the border to be abused, assaulted, or worse. Instead, they're locked up for a couple of days and then released with a notice to appear before an immigration judge, which most of them ignore. As for encouraging more people to come, that is precisely what conservatives predict will happen if we ever pass the kind of comprehensive immigration reform that Clinton claims to support. Is this her roundabout way of saying she agrees with them? We already knew that Obama had flunked immigration. Clinton's comments this week suggest that she finds the subject just as challenging.","Ruben Navarrette says Hillary Clinton doesn't seem to understand immigration issues .
He says her answer at CNN Town Hall started out OK but strayed off message .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- In the face of deadly violence gripping the east of his country, Ukraine's Prime Minister had a defiant message for his fellow countrymen and women Saturday on the eve of national elections: We are going to the polls. Voters will be choosing a president to lead their country, Arseniy Yatsenyuk said, ""for whose freedom, prosperity, European future, the Ukrainians are paying the highest price -- the price of their own lives."" This means, he said, in a statement posted on the interim government's website that ""the choice we make on Sunday and the responsibility of each of us is even higher."" The presidential election is being held amid ongoing separatist violence in eastern Ukraine, centered in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Voters will choose a successor for ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych in a country riven by Russia's takeover of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and aggression blamed on pro-Russian factions. Increasingly bloody clashes this week have raised the question of whether pro-Russian forces are trying to disrupt the election -- a move that the United States and its European allies say could trigger tougher sanctions on Moscow. The pro-Russia militants who control a swath of Donetsk and Luhansk have held a referendum on independence and refuse to accept the legitimacy of the government or the presidential election. But Yatsenyuk insisted that Ukrainians would have their say Sunday at the polls. ""Tomorrow we will prove to the whole world, and first of all to ourselves, that it is not possible to intimidate us, that we are going to decide ourselves how to rebuild our home and how to work in it,"" he said. ""But we have fought for these elections. We are defending our land, restoring our military, rebuilding the destroyed industry, destroying the schemes that had been washing billions out of the country; we are learning to control the power and laying the ground for further development,"" he said. Ukraine's 'Chocolate King' aims for top job . Election interference investigated . The Prosecutor General's office said Saturday it was investigating 83 cases of alleged interference in the election process in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Police chief Volodymyr Grynyuk of the Interior Ministry said district and local election commissions in 12 regions nationwide were under protection as of Saturday, according to the Cabinet press office. Of the 34 district election commissions set up in Donetsk and Luhansk, half are out of action because buildings have been seized by separatists and equipment destroyed, it said. But ballot papers have still been delivered to those regions. The self-declared mayor of rebel stronghold Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, has said that anyone who tries to vote in the presidential election will be arrested. And according to protesters speaking Saturday outside the headquarters of the self-declared ""Donetsk People's Republic,"" as well as the body's Twitter account, Donetsk and Luhansk have united to form a new separatist republic called ""Novorossiya."" The government in Kiev, which launched an ""anti-terrorist operation"" against the separatists, has so far been unable to dislodge them from the towns and cities they hold. But Yatsenyuk suggested their days in charge were numbered. ""I would like to assure our compatriots in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, who will be prevented from coming to the polling stations by the war waged against Ukraine: The criminals don't have much time left to terrorize your land,"" he said. Overall, 600 crimes have been registered in relation to separatist activity, threats to the country's integrity, terrorism and financing terrorist activities, the Prosecutor General's office said. More than 100 people have been detained. Russian recognition . Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Friday told an economic forum in St. Petersburg that he would respect the will of Ukraine's voters in Sunday's election. But he reiterated Russia's assertion that according to Ukraine's Constitution, the ousted Yanukovych remains the nation's legitimate president and questioned whether the election should be held now, given the violence in eastern Ukraine. The front-runner in the presidential contest is billionaire businessman and politician Petro Poroshenko. Speaking Saturday, Putin again addressed the issue of Russia's natural gas supply to Europe, much of which flows through Ukraine. Moscow has said Kiev owes Russian energy giant Gazprom $3.5 billion for natural gas and warned that any disruption to supplies will be Ukraine's fault. ""We are seriously concerned by the statements of some of the Ukrainian radicals and their direct threats to interfere with the transit of the Russian gas to Europe and we hope that common sense will prevail and that won't happen,"" Putin said. Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Meshkov said Friday that Russia would decide whether or not to recognize the Ukraine vote only after it takes place, according to state media. U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently said that disruption of the Ukraine vote by Russia would bring further sanctions targeting specific sectors of the Russian economy. So far, U.S. and European sanctions have targeted individuals and some banks and other entities . Kiev and Western powers have accused Russia of coordinating and supporting the unrest. Russia denies direct involvement with or influence on the separatist groups. Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security service, said Friday that no military operations were planned for the election, but alternative secure voting places would be arranged for some people in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions because of the separatist threat. On Friday, Ponomaryov, in Slovyansk, showed a CNN crew missile launchers known as man-portable air defense systems that he said were obtained on the black market in the 1990s and now could be used on Ukrainian military aircraft in the event of civil war. Luhansk, Donetsk clashes . As tensions simmer ahead of the vote, at least 32 people were killed and 44 injured in clashes Thursday between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian separatists in the Luhansk region, according to the country's anti-terror office spokesman, Vladislav Seleznev. Thirty pro-Russian separatists and two Ukrainian soldiers were among the dead, while the injured included 37 separatists and seven Ukrainian soldiers, Seleznev said Friday. Ukraine's defense ministry said 20 separatists died, with more than 30 wounded. The reports could not be independently confirmed, and some previous casualty claims by Ukrainian sources have proven unreliable. On Friday, pro-Ukrainian militias heading to shut down a pro-Russian checkpoint in Donetsk region came under attack, according to a regional Ukrainian authority and the chief of staff of one of the groups, called Right Sector. The Donetsk regional authority said one person died and nine were wounded, while the Right Sector official said four pro-Ukrainian fighters were trapped and may have been killed or captured. There were no further details on the affiliations of the casualties, and the reports also could not be independently confirmed. Ukraine's Security Service said Saturday that border guards this week had detained an alleged Russian national who told them he was a sniper under orders to join militia groups and target Ukrainian soldiers. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Slovyansk and journalist Victoria Butenko from Kiev, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Prosecutor General's office probes suspected election interference in eastern Ukraine .

"New York (CNN) -- In an era of entourages and media minders, rock-n-roll hall of famer Deborah Harry arrived to our interview alone. Wearing a black and white graphic scarf draped over a long sleeve T-shirt and practical black flip-flops, she wandered in off the street, browsing the hotel art installation like any other tourist. But this was no casual viewing. Strewn around the room was four decades of memories -- stunning black and white photos taken by Blondie bandmate and one-time boyfriend Chris Stein. It took me a few minutes to realize it was her. She seemed strangely detached looking at her younger self. But then, it was a lifetime ago. Blondie hit their stride when the lines between music and video were mingling. They made their mark in the space between punk, new wave and disco and introduced mass audiences to hip-hop. They were a fixture on the New York scene, but that is a landscape that has changed literally ...and musically. When Stein arrived a short time after Harry, in his trademark leather and shades, he paused to look at the blown-up photo of Harry up on the top of the World Trade Center observation deck. It made him emotional to see that building, now gone. Neither could remember the exact date he snapped the shot or why she seems to be holding a folded bill. It was just one of the ghosts in the room. We talked about the clubs that have closed, music stores shuttered. Songs now premiere on YouTube before the radio or TV. You might expect the veteran rockers to lament this lost past. But Harry and Stein are surprisingly open about the change. While Harry has been quoted in the past as saying the internet killed music, she was much more nuanced in our conversation. ""It makes it more important to tour, there is no record industry to speak of, but I sort of appreciate that a person can download a track they love,"" said Harry. Stein also seemed to appreciate technology's ability to reach an audience. ""It used to be a struggle to get yourself on television -- before MTV even more so -- now it's completely secondary,"" he said. ""Now you can just press a button and watch anyone doing anything anywhere doing anything. In unison they agreed: ""The verdict is not in yet."" The new studio album may be called Ghosts of Download, but both artists feel it's forward looking, especially in the collaborations. Beth Ditto of Indie rock group Gossip, Oakland-based Panamanian rappers Los Rakas and Colombian Systema Solar are featured on tracks. Stein, laughing, noted: ""I think my ego is less pronounced -- it's easier to take ideas from other people."" Though they may be rock-n-roll royalty, they are incredibly down to earth. Harry, still striking, has a wry smile and a slight mystery about her. Stein is more open. We joked about TV binge-watching House of Cards and Game of Thrones (which was why he was running late) and the difficulty of getting things done in politics. Does Harry have a favorite song? Rapture and a little known track Cautious Lip, she wished she could play live. They tag team a conversation the way only long-time partners can. ""We get along,"" joked Stein when I asked how they have survived when so many other bands haven't. The best thing about touring? ""The fans,"" Harry said without hesitation. The worst? ""Being away from my wife and kids,"" said Stein, who is married to actress Barbara Sicuranza. Though people dismiss the potency of aging rockers, there is a history they carry that is hard to resist. When I asked if they had a favorite live performance, they an told amazing story about being in Bangkok on New Year's Eve in the 70s, the night the curfew from the Vietnam War was lifted. The band may have a treasure trove of memories, but they are now 40 years on -- in their words, Blondie 4(0) Ever -- and looking to the future.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer added fuel to the paternity leave debate as he crashed out of the Rome Masters just eight days after welcoming twin boys to his clan. Federer will be back on nappy changing duties sooner than he may have expected after losing 6-1 3-6 7-6(6) to Frenchman Jeremy Chardy Wednesday. The French world No. 47 saved a match point to record his first ever victory over the Swiss 17-time grand slam champion. ""I think we both struggled to win today and at the end a shot here or there may have decided the match,"" Federer told reporters in Rome. ""But credit to him for fighting his way back into the match."" It was the 32-year-old father of four's first match back since the birth of Lenny and Leo -- brothers to twin girls Charlene Riva and Myla Rose. Federer had explained that wife Mirka, along with his coaching team, had encouraged him to make a quick return to work on the tennis tour on the eve of the Rome tournament. ""They told me to come here and play,"" Federer told reporters at Foro Italico. ""So I said 'OK, if you don't want me around, I'll go away! I miss them a lot already.'"" The world No. 4, however, revealed plans that will dodge any future problems over time away from his twin boys. ""The plan is that they can come on tour,"" he added. ""At least we know how to handle kids on the road. ""I am aware it's going to be a lot of work but at the same time it's something I'm really looking forward to."" The Rome Masters is the final major warm-up event for the second grand slam of the year, the French Open. Looking ahead to the clay-court slam, which begins on 25th May, Federer commented: ""I did have my family but everything is under control. And I still feel good, body and mind."" There were victories on the Rome clay Wednesday for Britain's Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, Germany's Tommy Haas and Russian Mikhail Youzhny. Spanish eight-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal opened his Rome title defense with a tough 7-6 6-7 6-2 victory over Giles Simon of France. In the women's draw, Venus Williams had her comeback from illness curtailed by Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro. After a sizzling first-round win Tuesday, the 33-year-old American was beaten 6-4 6-2. The seven-time grand slam winner now has to manage her tennis career after the effects of Sjogren's syndrome, a debilitating autoimmune disease. There were comfortable wins for world No.1 Serena Williams, Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, Australia's Sam Stosur and Italians Francesca Schiavone and Sara Errani.","Roger Federer loses first match back since birth of twin boys last week .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Here's the best way to understand the new India in 30 seconds. Watch this commercial—or better yet, if you don't understand Hindi, read on. A smarmy-looking politician addresses a rural gathering, promising to give the people access to water. His speech is interrupted by a boyish young man, a villager, who pulls out his smartphone and plays a YouTube video for all to see: it's the same politician, making the same promises at the last election, years ago. ""I might be from the village,"" cries out the young man, ""but don't think you can fool me!"" The commercial—marketing an Indian mobile service provider—cuts to its familiar Hindi jingle, loosely translated as ""no making fools of us anymore, no making fools of us."" The story struck me because it weaves together some important trends and forces in India as the nation undertakes the biggest elections in world history. The first trend is the immense proliferation of Internet-enabled smartphones. In most Western countries, people have discovered the Internet and grown with it in stages: from painfully slow dial-up connections, to broadband, to Wi-Fi, to 4G mobile Internet. India's story has been very different. Until recently only a small elite—about a tenth of the population—could access the Internet, mostly through PCs. Even today, there are only 57 million broadband  subscribers in the country, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, or TRAI. By comparison, there are about 900 million mobile subscribers—a recent boom. Many of these mobile users are buying cheap smartphones and data packages to access the Internet. The offshoot is the opposite of what happens in the West: Hundreds of millions of Indians have never used a PC—and likely never will—but they can now begin to access the Internet on their phones. The Internet is aspirational in India; it's the new motorbike or washing machine. The second trend is the rise of rural India. Again, according to TRAI, 40% of mobile subscribers are now in villages and small towns. Even with the recent boom, rural subscriptions are still growing at more than twice the rate of urban ones. These rural subscribers, as the commercial shows, often don't speak English. But there's no longer a great shame in being unable to speak the language of their colonial masters; instead, there's a new pride and confidence in India's many regional dialects and languages. There's new rural money, and a yearning to be stakeholders in their futures and to fight for more accountable government. The third trend is India's youth bulge. More than 100 million voters in India's elections are first-timers who turned 18 in the last five years. Half of all Indians are under age 30; the average age in India is 28. Many of these young, brash Indians have cast off the fatalism of their forefathers. Growing up in an India of fast growth and development, they have more confidence in their culture, identity and language. Put that together with trends No. 1 and No. 2, and the result is amplified. For the first time in India's history, a majority of Indians are connected and engaged. They know about the skeletons in every politician's closet—and that information is power. Some suggest that these trends mean India's elections will be fought and decided on social media. Politicians have taken their cue, rushing to every platform available: Twitter, Facebook and Google Hangouts. The numbers seem staggering at first. Facebook says Narendra Modi, the front-runner to be India's next prime minister, is the second most ""liked"" politician in the world (13 million likes), after U.S. President Barack Obama (40 million likes). According to Twitter, there has been a 600% increase in political Tweets from India in the last year. Since January the two biggest parties, the BJP and the Congress, have grown their Twitter followings by 55% and 351% respectively. India's Internet and Mobile Association says a strong social media campaign could swing up to 4% of votes. Commentators have cited that data to brand India's elections the country's first-ever ""social media election."" For now, I'm skeptical. Some of the outreach attempts have been amateur at best: As Vox.com pointed out, the BJP's Twitter handle last week auto-tweeted anyone who mentioned the party on Twitter, including me and hundreds of others. In any case, the number of actual social media users represents a tiny percentage of the Indian electorate. Facebook says it has 100 million users in India: it sounds like a lot but it accounts for less than a tenth of Indians. One reason for this -- apart from limits to Internet access -- could be that Twitter and Facebook remain English language services, relatable to a small subset of Indians. Unlike China, which has a Chinese-language microblogging service called Sina Weibo, with hundreds of millions of users, India for now has no such indigenous, umbrella platform. Why? India is no monolith. There are dozens of languages, and an equal number of different Indias. Despite India's growth and increased connectivity, which suggests a more unified nation, the country may actually be becoming more regional-focused, with more pride in local languages, trends and politicians. This is also why I think it's far too early to call India's elections for any one politician or party. The three trends of mobile reach, the rural rise and the youth bulge are each combustible forces bubbling in a cauldron of uncertainty. Indians may want accountability and change, but it's too soon to tell which way that will manifest itself. It remains unclear whether Indians will vote for their regional interests, or cast their ballot thinking about a macro national picture. Watch India's elections very closely. They're immensely consequential—for India, and the world. But placing too much importance on social media chatter could be misleading. Calling these elections too early could be embarrassing, too. It is, as the ad-jingle goes, a fool's errand.","A commercial shows India voter catching a politician recycling old, unfulfilled promises .

The teen daughter of the late ""Crocodile Hunter"" Steve Irwin said in a recent interview with News Corp Australia that she is ""a big advocate for young girls dressing their age."" ""I mean, for me, I look around at a lot of young girls that are my age and they're always trying to dress older,"" said Irwin, who turns 16 on July 24. ""Whether it's wearing revealing clothes or hardly wearing any clothes at all, I feel really bad for them."" Irwin, who has picked up the wildlife conservation advocacy legacy of her father and grew up at the Australia Zoo, said she considers herself to be an old soul who ""loves a cup of tea and a good book."" And while Irwin said her own personal style is evolving from her trademark khakis to more fashionable fare, she keeps it simple and conservative. ""A lot of times I want to grab these girls and say: 'Look, in 10 years you'll regret this,' "" she said. ""Just dress like who you are. Don't try so hard.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- No candidate won enough votes to secure outright victory in the first round of the Afghan presidential poll, the election commission said Thursday. The election will proceed to a runoff on June 14 between former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani, the two candidates who received the highest number of votes. In the first-round, in which around 7 millions Afghans voted on April 5, Abdullah secured 45% of the vote, while Ghani got 31.6%. A candidate needs to receive more than 50% of the votes to win the first round and avoid a runoff. Preliminary results had been announced in late April, but had to be finalized after investigations into fraud complaints. The final results from the runoff will be announced on July 22, the election commission said. It's the third election since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, and is set to be the first democratic transfer of power in the fragile, war-torn country. Abdullah was a vocal critic of the Taliban during their years in power, and although he was once an ally of incumbent President Hamid Karzai, serving in his government as foreign minister, he has in later years become an opponent. He challenged Karzai in the 2009 election but dropped out after the first round to protest what he said was large-scale voting fraud. Ghani is a former academic and U.S. citizen who gave up his passport to run for the Afghan presidency in 2009. He worked as an adviser to Karzai and also as finance minister in his Cabinet. CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","No candidate secures more than 50% of votes .

"(CNN) -- The hidden skeleton of a woman who had been missing for 28 years came to light when a contractor cleaned out a vacant home in the Town of Poughkeepsie, New York. The gruesome find was uncovered behind a 'false wall' in the basement of the home the woman had shared with her late husband, police said. Joann Nichols' remains were found inside a large plastic bin, inside a plastic bag and wrapped in a sheet, said Dr. Kari Reiber, the Dutchess County Medical Examiner. ""The body was skeletonized and the hands were tied with rope. ... A large area of the right side of the skull was also missing,"" Reiber said. Sealing the body in the plastic bin behind a false wall might have been enough to mask the smell as the body decomposed, she said. Members of the medical examiner's office removed the body after it was found Friday and were able to identify Nichols through dental records. An autopsy showed the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, according to Reiber. Nichols, a 55-year-old former first-grade teacher at Gayhead Elementary School in Hopewell Junction New York, was reported missing on December 21, 1985, by her husband, James Nichols. Police said he called in the report after his wife didn't show up for a hair appointment at a beauty parlor earlier that day. The next day the couple's vehicle was discovered in the parking lot of a shopping center in the town. Police Chief Thomas Mauro said an intensive investigation followed, but the woman was never located. The case had remained open since 1985 and was reviewed annually by police, he said. James Nichols was found dead in the home on December 27 after concerned neighbors called police because they had not seen him in several days. He was 82 and died of natural causes, police said. Officers said they found the house filled with personal items, debris and garbage. No one in Nichols' family came forward to claim his body or take control of his estate, so Dutchess County Commissioner of Finance Pamela Barrack was appointed as temporary administrator, according to Barrack's attorney, Kelly Traver. ""We were only able to locate two family members of Mr. Nichols, but they were not able to claim his body,"" Traver said. Nichols was buried by the Dutchess County Department of Community and Family Services in an unknown location, Traver said. The Town of Poughkeepsie Police Department said it has not closed the case and will continue to examine the new forensic evidence. ""It's now safe to say James Nichols is a suspect in this case,"" said police Capt. Paul LeComte. The Town of Poughkeepsie surrounds the City of Poughkeepsie in southeastern New York State, about 70 miles north of New York City.

"(CNN) -- Drainage tubes. Waterfalls. Bullrings. These aren't features typically associated with hotels, but the most interesting places to stay in Latin America somehow make them work. This group of hotels goes a few steps further than turndown service and a free breakfast lineup to make your stay memorable. Tubohotel (Topoztlan, Mexico) Modeled after the funky Dasparkhotel in Linz, Austria, the Tubohotel has transformed 20 concrete sewer pipes into minimalistic hotel rooms.

Costa Verde (Quepos, Costa Rica) In the dense forest along the western coast of Costa Rica lies the body of an old Boeing 727. It's not the ominous remains of a flight gone wrong, but rather a luxury hotel suite. Dangling over the side of a hill amid a selection of more traditional accommodations, the fuselage of the vintage 1965 jetliner has been remade into a two-bedroom rental complete with dining area, sitting room and a small wooden deck for spotting the toucans, howler monkeys and other jungle creatures. The fuselage that encases the two bedrooms of the ""727 Fuselage Home"" suite is intact.

Today, it's a hotel and nature observatory. The rooftop deck offers a 360-degree view of the forest below.

"(CNN) -- Two Gonzaga University students could be suspended or even expelled after using a handgun to defend themselves from an intruder in their university-owned apartment, an act which the university says violates the school's weapons policy. Gonzaga University, a private, four-year university in Spokane, Washington, says the students violated the school's weapons policy by having firearms in their apartment, which is in a complex near the campus. On the night of October 24, students Erik Fagan and Daniel McIntosh were in their apartment when there was a knock on the door. Fagan told CNN affiliate KXLY in Spokane that he opened the door and a stranger, who said he'd just gotten out of jail, asked for $15. Fagan told KXLY he offered the man a blanket and a can of food, but ""didn't feel comfortable"" giving the man money because he was a stranger. ""My gut instinct was telling me I wasn't going to be able to get that door closed before he came through,"" Fagan told KXLY. As the man started coming through the door, Fagan said, he yelled for his roommate, Daniel McIntosh. McIntosh said he came to the door with his pistol drawn, and the students said the man turned and ran away. Because the apartments are owned by Gonzaga, both police and campus security responded when Fagan and McIntosh called 911. According to the Gonzaga's Executive Vice President Earl Martin, all university housing is patrolled at regular intervals by campus security, though this particular apartment complex isn't gated and secured key cards or codes aren't required for entrance. A short while after the incident, police captured the man, whom they identified as a six-time convicted felon. At about 2 a.m., campus security officers returned to Fagan and McIntosh's apartment and confiscated a pistol and a shotgun from the apartment. Dean Chuang, attorney for Fagan and McIntosh, said the shotgun is owned by Fagan, who uses it to hunt periodically, and it wasn't used in the incident. He added that the pistol that was used in the incident belonged to McIntosh, and was a gift to him from his grandfather several years ago. McIntosh has a state-issued permit to carry a concealed handgun, Chuang said. In Washington state, gun owners are not required to register their weapons. In a disciplinary board hearing on Friday, the board, made up of three faculty members and two students, found Fagan and McIntosh guilty of two infractions -- possessing weapons on school grounds and putting others in danger by the use of weapons, according to Chuang. Chuang told CNN the students expect to hear later this week what disciplinary action will be taken by the board. Fagan and McIntosh both face suspension or expulsion. Both are seniors and have exemplary records, Chuang said. Meantime, Fagan and McIntosh have asked university security to return their firearms, but that hasn't yet happened. According to Chuang, one of the students had never lived in campus housing and was unaware of the school's weapons policy. The other, he said, was aware of the policy but didn't think it applied to him because the apartment isn't on campus. ""They had the right to defend themselves and others, regardless of what the policy says,"" Chuang told CNN. Though the university couldn't talk about specifics of this case due to privacy laws, Martin said, ""I'm not aware of other instances like this in particular."" The policy, which is on the university's official website, states that weapons, which includes firearms, are prohibited ""at any location on campus, or within University residences."" In a statement released Saturday by university President Thayne McCulloh, there have been calls for a re-examination of the university's policies relating to firearms. McCulloh said in the release he believes this is an opportunity for the university community to objectively re-examine the policy and ""openly debate perspectives and contextual issues."" McCulloh's statement said he has asked the Vice President for Student Development to work with several campus organizations to ""facilitate a campus dialogue focused on this issue."" Meantime, he added, the current student handbook and code of conduct remain in effect. Louisiana kidnap victim's cousin kicks down door, shoots and kills abductor .

"Jindo, South Korea (CNN) -- Through the unrelenting rain, with the biting winds whipping against her tear-stained face, Christine Kim stands on the cold, gray harbor. ""Inside that water,"" she says, pointing to the choppy waves on the Yellow Sea, ""there are children whom I teach and my own child."" Kim is an English teacher at a private tutoring center. Some of her students were aboard the Sewol headed to the resort island of Jeju when the passenger ferry listed and sank. Twenty people were confirmed dead, and 276 were still missing early Friday, according to the South Korean Ministry of Security and Public Administration. One of them is Kim's youngest daughter. ""My daughter's in the water,"" Kim said, her voice breaking. Regret . When the school trip came up at the Anson Daewon High School, her daughter, Billy, was initially reluctant. The family had taken a visit to Jeju less than two months earlier. She didn't want to go on a four-day trip. ""I don't want to go there because I went there one time,"" her daughter told her. Kim convinced her otherwise. ""I think this travel would be a great experience for your school days,"" she recalls telling her. So, Tuesday night, Billy boarded the ferry. The next morning, shortly before 9 a.m., students heard a loud bang and the ship began to list. Some jumped into the frigid water and were rescued. Others have not been heard from. ""All of this,"" Kim laments, ""happened because of me."" Sadness . Throughout the night Wednesday and into Thursday, family members have camped out at the Paeng Mok Harbor, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from where the ship capsized. They sit on plastic chairs, huddled together for warmth with blankets on their shoulders. They're handed coffee cups and instant noodles as they stand vigil. Mothers and grandmothers cry and console each other. One elderly man sits on a chair -- his cell phone in his hands, his hands clasped together as if in prayer. All of them waiting for answers, hoping for a sign. ""It's been almost 30 hours,"" Kim says. ""I can't sleep because my daughter's in the water, in the cold, cold water -- I can never sleep."" Anger . After the accident, local media lit up with reports of text messages they said were from passengers. In one, a passenger describes women screaming in the darkness. In another, a father learns his child is trapped. In a third, a son, fearing death, tells his mother he loves her. They haven't been authenticated. But they are reason enough for some parents to believe more survivors will be found. The parents here are angry that officials aren't taking the messages seriously. ""We're getting texts from our children from the boat, but they don't believe us,"" Kim said. Kim isn't alone in pointing the finger at the South Korean government. It has failed to expend all necessary efforts to rescue the students, she says. Rescue officials say they are at the mercy of the elements. It's drizzling, making for poor visibility. The water currents are powerful, making for dangerous operations. Three divers who took it upon themselves to go look for the missing were momentarily swept away by the tide Thursday. A fishing boat eventually picked them up. The massive rescue efforts has included 169 boats, 29 planes and 512 divers. Crews will next bring in cranes to stabilize the ship. ""The families must be so heartbroken, I know it's hard,"" South Korean president Park Geun-hye said after touring the accident site Thursday. ""Please,"" she told rescuers, ""I urge you, do your best."" Chang Min, whose second-grade son is among the missing, says he's willing to trust the government ""one last time. But Kim is critical. ""The government is doing nothing for us, as our children are drowning,"" she says. Hope . The despondent mother breaks into a smile when she talks about how Billy came to pick such a typically American boy's name for herself. She loved goats when she was little. So she decided to call herself one. Billy promised her mom she would bring back some delicious snacks from Jeju. She waits for her daughter.

The action film debuted higher than franchise launchpad ""The Bourne Identity,"" which grossed $27.1 million in its 2002 opening weekend, but it will need solid word of mouth (which may not be merited by its lukewarm ""B"" CinemaScore grade) to match that film's $121.7 million finish. ""Legacy"" was unable to reach the heights of its two predecessors, though. ""The Bourne Supremacy"" started with $52.5 million on the way to $176.2 million, and 2007′s ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" started with $69.3 million en route to a $227.5 million finish. The past year has been a great one for Jeremy Renner, who nabbed roles in back-to-back blockbusters ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" and ""The Avengers,"" and while the opening of ""Legacy"" is another solid notch on his belt, it still doesn't prove definitively that he is a real box office draw. The original ""Bourne"" trilogy earned the franchise a tremendous amount of goodwill from audiences, and it's that franchise trust that likely benefited ""Legacy"" (and ""Mission,"" and ""Avengers"") more than Renner's presence. Whether the formidable actor can pull in audiences on his own remains to be seen. Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis' election comedy ""The Campaign"" took second place with $27.4 million. The R-rated laugher kicked off its run in the same range as Ferrell's last live-action wide release ""The Other Guys"" ($35.5 million), and Galifianakis' last non-""Hangover"" comedy ""Due Date"" ($32.7 million). While ""The Campaign's"" grosses are a bit lower than those movies (and recent R-rated hit ""21 Jump Street,"" which opened with $36.1 million), the debut frame is remarkably impressive considering the subject matter. American audiences have never been particularly receptive to political comedies. ""Team America: World Police"" (2004) has found a huge cult following, but it earned just $32.8 million in its theatrical run. ""American Dreamz"" (2006) gave the ""American Idol"" format a political spin, but it topped off at $7.2 million. Political tales ""Man of the Year"" (2006) and ""Swing Vote"" (2008, an election year), grossed only $37.3 million and $16.3 million, respectively. The highest grossing political comedy in recent memory is actually Sacha Baron Cohen's ""The Dictator,"" which was widely perceived as a misfire when it earned $59.7 million against a rumored $100-plus million budget and massive advertising campaign. Political storylines simply don't offer audiences the escapism they typically desire at the movies, but between the interest in politics now that we're in the middle of election season, combined with Ferrell and Galifianakis' undeniably silly personas, which don't suggest a serious political point-of-view, ""The Campaign"" clicked for ticket buyers, and it will become a solid hit for both actors. Time will tell how high the film actually climbs, though its unenthusiastic ""B-"" CinemaScore grade may limit endurance. Due to heavy competition, Warner Bros.' other big release, ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" slipped into third place with $19.5 million, a 45 percent drop from last weekend. After four frames, Christopher Nolan's $250 million Batman finale has soared to $390.1 million, and it will pass ""The Hunger Games' "" $407.3 million cume to become 2012′s second-highest-grossing domestic performer next weekend. (It's already achieved this title worldwide.) In fourth place was ""Hope Springs,"" the Meryl Streep/Tommy Lee Jones dramedy (which also stars Steve Carell as their marriage therapist), which earned $15.6 million over the Friday-to-Sunday period in 2,361 theaters. Prospects looked somewhat grim for ""Hope"" when it earned a quiet $4.5 million over Wednesday and Thursday, but the film's overwhelmingly older female audience (66 percent were women, 69 percent were 40 or older), who aren't all relaxing on their summer breaks, turned out in higher volumes for weekend engagements. After five days, the film, which was issued a ""B"" CinemaScore grade, has earned $20.1 million. Sony paid just $15 million to acquire ""Hope Springs"" from Mandate, who shelled out $29 million to produce the film, and if it proves as leggy as some of Streep's other films — ""Julie and Julia"" climbed to $94.1 million after a $20 million weekend, and ""It's Complicated"" earned $122.7 million after a $22.1 million debut -- it will become a profitable mid-level hit for the studios. ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days"" rounded out the top five, dropping 44 percent to $8.2 million, which lifts the kiddie flick's total to $30.6 million after ten days. Its predecessor, ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules,"" had earned $38.2 million at the same point in its run, but that film started with $23.7 million, while ""Dog Days"" started with just $14.6 million — a difference of $9.1 million. Fortunately, strong summer weekday performances have helped ""Dog Days"" close the difference to $7.6 million, and the $22 million Fox film could finish with about $45 million. Also of note: last weekend's top opener, ""Total Recall"" plunged 68 percent to $8.1 million in its sophomore frame, and has now earned only $44.2 million against its $125 million budget. 1.

"London (CNN) -- When he was a 15-year-old schoolboy, Paul Wallace joined his father to see an exhibition of the world's most ostentatious automobiles. Wallace was entranced, and pulled out his camera to take photos. The visit, taking in Aston Martins, Ferraris and Lamborghinis, would prove the beginnings of his lucrative YouTube video channel. ""I sort of fell on my feet in that sense,"" the entrepreneur told CNN. Wallace, still too young to get a driver's license, began filming supercars around London, and uploading them to YouTube. The street shots and low resolution videos brought the cars ""to life"" for fans unable to afford one, Wallace said. Now, the 23-year-old university graduate earns up to Â£4,000 ($6,722) a month from the advertisements displayed on his YouTube video channel, Supercars of London. His account has had almost 70 million views, with hits coming from all over the world. Wallace is now making a living from the site -- one of a number of YouTubers building a business out of the video platform. Wallace has used his earnings to indulge his passion: buying his own supercar. The purchase of a Â£55,000 Audi R8 enabled Wallace to return his mom's Ford Focus, which had been on loan. ""I'm very much at the early stages of where I want to be, say, in five to 10 years time,"" Wallace told CNN. And his supercar ambition remains unchanged.

"(CNN) -- The white stretch Lincoln was headed across San Francisco Bay, carrying the bride-to-be and eight of her friends for a bachelorette party. Five of them, including the bride, never made it across. Somewhere on the seven-mile San Mateo-Hayward bridge, the limousine caught fire. The driver and four members of the bachelorette party got out, but the bride -- identified by a relative as 31-year-old Neriza Fojas -- and four others died in the burning limo Saturday night, the California Highway Patrol said. ""The flames were gigantic,"" said Roxanne Guzman, who was crossing the bridge with her husband and brother about 10 p.m. Saturday (1 a.m. Sunday ET). ""The flames were so big and radiating so much heat that I could feel the heat off of my face, and I was in my car the entire time."" Guzman said the survivors appeared to be in a state of shock on the shoulder of the roadway, with three of them crying. Other passersby had stopped, but police and firefighters hadn't arrived yet, she said. The driver was uninjured, but the four surviving women were treated for smoke inhalation, California Highway Patrol spokesman Ron Simmons said Sunday. The cause of the blaze was under investigation. ""Looking at the photos, it appears it started in the trunk,"" Simmons said. ""But at this time, we don't know officially if the fire started inside the vehicle or on the exterior."" Lovela Nicolas, the sister-in-law of Fojas' sister, said Fojas was a registered nurse. The Fresno woman was slated to be married in June, and she and her friends had hired the Lincoln for her bachelorette party, Nicolas said. ""Neriza was getting married, going to Philippines to get married there and have ceremony there and the reception,"" Nicolas told CNN from her home in Honolulu. The mother of one of the surviving women told CNN affiliate KTVU that her daughter, Mary Guardiano, was upset but physically OK. ""She's very sad. She is crying,"" said Rosita Guardiano. In a written statement, the limousine company said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the deaths. ""LimoStop Inc. will do everything possible to investigate and assist authorities in determining the cause of this fire in order to help bring forth answers and provide closure to the victims and their families,"" it said.

"(Health.com) -- Pamela Sakuda, 57, was anxious and depressed. After two years of intensive chemotherapy for late-stage colon cancer, and having outlived her prognosis by several months, she'd finally lost hope. She was living in fear and was worried how her impending death would affect her husband. Sakuda's doctor prescribed antidepressants, but they didn't do any good. So, at her wits' end and feeling that she had nothing to lose, Sakuda volunteered for an experimental depression treatment being studied at UCLA. In January 2005, with a pair of trained therapists at her side, Sakuda took a pill of psilocybin -- a hallucinogen better known as the active ingredient in ""magic mushrooms."" It may seem far-fetched that a psychedelic drug associated with muddy hippies at Woodstock would help a cancer patient at a university hospital. Yet it's an increasingly familiar scene. Although mind-bending drugs such as psilocybin are still used most often by people looking to get high, researchers around the country have begun to explore whether these and other illegal drugs can help treat intractable depression, anxiety, and other mental-health problems. Health.com: Should you take antidepressants? In the past month alone, studies have been published on the benefits of MDMA (better known as Ecstasy) in people with post-traumatic stress disorder and on the fast-acting antidepressive effects of the club drug ketamine (aka ""Special K""). The study in which Sakuda took part is scheduled to appear in a major journal in early September. So far the studies have been small, but the results have been encouraging and bigger trials are on the horizon. Drugs such as psilocybin and Ecstasy can be dangerous in the wrong hands. But when taken under professional supervision and combined with therapy, researchers say, just one or two doses can help patients unlock the sources of their troubles and experience therapeutic breakthroughs that otherwise might take months or years. ""It can be like psychotherapy sped up,"" says psychiatrist Stephen Ross, M.D., an addiction expert at New York University who is leading a study on psilocybin treatment in cancer patients with severe anxiety. ""Their defenses are lowered, [and] they have enormous access to unconscious material."" Psilocybin revitalized Sakuda. As the effects of the drug were wearing off, the therapists called in her husband, Norbert Litzinger, to see her. ""There's my Pammy,"" Litzinger recalls thinking. ""She's just beaming with light, and I haven't seen that joyousness for so long. She was just totally alive, she was totally happy."" Health.com: 7 types of therapy that can help depression . The return of the acid test . Scientists have been investigating the therapeutic effects of hallucinogens, MDMA, and other synthetic drugs since the 1940s. In perhaps the most famous example, a team of researchers led by psychologist Timothy Leary explored the effects of psilocybin and LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide, or ""acid"") in a series of experiments conducted at Harvard University in the early 1960s. But research into the potential benefits of psychedelic drugs ground to a halt in the early 1970s, after the federal government criminalized LSD and psilocybin -- and after the drugs were eagerly adopted by college students and the hippie counterculture. ""These studies had to be shut down because of the cultural reaction,"" says Charles Grob, M.D., a professor of psychiatry at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, in Torrance, California, and the lead researcher of the study that included Sakuda. ""It kind of tarnished the image of the entire field."" The new wave of research on psychedelics -- ""version 2.0,"" as  Ross calls it -- began in the early 1990s, when the Food and Drug Administration  sanctioned a few preliminary studies on psilocybin and MDMA. (The latter had been used in psychotherapy beginning in the 1970s, without the FDA's blessing, and was ultimately outlawed in 1985.) The research has picked up dramatically in the past few years. Health.com: Supplements for depression: what works . The researchers are ""going at it in the right way this time,"" says Bruce Stadel, M.D., a retired FDA medical officer who has been following the new crop of studies. ""These drugs in the 60s were just let loose without any proper study. [Now] they're going through the FDA, through the process of clinical trials."" Researchers have not been able to get federal grants, however. While the FDA has signed off on the studies, they have all been privately funded, most notably by nonprofit organizations such as the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), in Santa Cruz, California, and the Heffter Research Institute, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Don't try this at home . The psilocybin study Ross is leading at NYU is typical of the new-generation research. On two separate occasions during the nine-month study, which is being funded by the Heffter Research Institute, patients are given a silver chalice containing either a psilocybin pill or a placebo. The patient then lies down on a brown sofa surrounded by artwork, sculptures of Buddha, and, on a nearby bookshelf, a little glass mushroom with a red cap. For the next six hours, the patient listens, with eyes shaded, to a combination of classical, Eastern, and tribal music. A pair of therapists -- who don't know whether the patient has taken an active drug or placebo -- stay in the room for support, though they encourage the patient to remain in a meditative state. This may sound a bit trippy. But the science behind the research is sound, says Franz Vollenweider, M.D., a psychiatrist at the University of Zurich, in Switzerland, and a member of the Heffter Research Institute's board of directors. According to Vollenweider, who has conducted brain-imaging studies on the effects of psychedelics and MDMA, these drugs appear to affect levels of serotonin and other chemicals in the body and brain that help regulate mood. Health.com: Could hallucinogenic drugs have healing properties? When everything goes well, the drugs induce a ""peaceful and blissful"" state of unity with oneself and the cosmos, resulting in a new level of self-awareness and knowledge that can make an individual more responsive to cognitive therapy and other forms of psychotherapy, Vollenweider says. (Ironically, the drugs show promise in the treatment of alcohol addiction, he adds.) In cancer patients such as Sakuda, ""these spiritually oriented altered states...potentially allow patients to have an abrupt shift of consciousness from being scared about dying and feeling their life is over,"" says Grob. ""It was quite remarkable to me to see changes in these people who were very anxious and in distress, and [to] see how they got better."" But it's not always a smooth trip. Depending on the dose, as well as an individual's personality, the drugs can elicit fear, anxiety, paranoia, and, in some cases, a state akin to psychosis. ""It's not so easy -- it can be excruciatingly painful,"" says Grob. ""Those six hours that one is immersed in the experience can feel like the longest hours in a person's life."" For this reason, the drugs should only be given in exact doses in a carefully controlled setting, researchers say. Moreover, months of follow-up therapy are recommended to sort through the insights gleaned during the session and to ensure that they are applied productively to everyday life. A prescription for psilocybin? The early results of the new research are promising. In the MDMA study published in July, for instance, 10 of the 12 people who took the drug no longer met the criteria for post-traumatic stress two months later. And all five of the patients that have enrolled in Ross's study so far -- eventually it will include a few dozen -- have shown significant decreases in anxiety and depression. Health.com: Can Ecstasy help ease post-traumatic stress? ""They've all improved,"" Ross says. ""There appears to be something there."" Researchers hope that if the ongoing preliminary studies prove the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for certain treatments, the government will step in to fund larger trials. Rick Doblin, Ph.D., the founder and president of MAPS, says that this could happen in the next three years. But don't expect to get a prescription for magic mushrooms from your psychiatrist any time soon. It will likely be a decade before the FDA approves a psychedelic as medicine, if it does so at all, says Doblin. The most likely candidate is MDMA for post-traumatic stress, he adds. ""What we're trying to move towards is this legitimization of this field of psychedelic medicine, but we have to do it through the FDA, one drug at a time."" Petros Levounis, M.D., an addiction psychiatrist at the Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons, in New York City, and a former chair of the American Psychiatric Association's committee on addiction treatment, emphasizes that psychedelics are far from being a mainstream treatment. ""This is a line of research that does have some data that show a potential for some positive outcomes,"" he says. ""But we are very, very far from recommending hallucinogens for the treatment of terminally ill patients."" Still, the experiences of people like Sakuda hold out hope for people who have struggled to overcome depression and anxiety. Health.com: 10 things to say (and not say) to someone with depression . Sakuda's depression gradually lifted after her psilocybin session, which her husband credits with bringing about an ""epiphany"" and a ""revival."" Her depression and anxiety had prevented her from being active and enjoying life, but before long she and her husband were going to concerts again and hiking the north rim of the Grand Canyon. Meanwhile, Sakuda's cancer had continued to spread. On November 10, 2006, she died at home in her husband's arms, just a few days after speaking at a fund-raiser for the Heffter Research Institute, which funded  Grob's study. In a video on the institute's website, Sakuda described the surge of emotion and newfound perspective that she experienced on psilocybin, and which had such an impact on the final years of her life. ""I don't think the drug is the cause of these things,"" she said. ""I think it's a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place [where] you've bound them very tightly.""

"(CNN) -- Painted sky-blue, these small flying machines may look like toy planes but they have South Korea scrambling to secure its airspace. In recent weeks, South Korea's defense ministry has discovered three crashed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that it believes belong to Pyongyang. Equipped with Japanese-made digital cameras, the drones captured images of important military installations and South Korea's presidential office in Seoul, according to local media reports. South Korea says the aircraft are a sign of Pyongyang's heightened surveillance that should be taken seriously, and yet officials and experts suggest the drones pose little, if any, real threat. ""The small drones, presumed to have come from North Korea, don't really have great military significance,"" a spokesperson for South Korea's defense ministry, Kim Min-seok told reporters on Tuesday. ""Even if they are to be used for future attacks,(they) can only carry 2-3 kilograms of TNT and cannot cause a huge (amount of) damage,"" he said. Unmanned drone crashes on South Korean border island . The machines are made of polycarbonate, which is difficult to detect with radar, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. The vehicle, which flies at an average speed of about 110 km per hour at an altitude of 1.3 km, is controlled by a basic transmission system but isn't sophisticated enough to send images instantaneously. ""Even if it is used for reconnaissance with a camera attached, the quality will be no better than information collected by commercial satellites,"" said Kim. ""Also, there is a limit to how much it can be utilized in operations because they don't have (a) real-time transmission function."" Of the three drones, two have turned up images of targets of military significance -- strategically important islands near the Demilitarized Zone, and the Blue House, residence and office of South Korea's President Park Keun Hye. The data from the third drone, which had been found by a wild ginseng digger, could not be analyzed as its discoverer had wiped the camera's memory card for his own use, the Korea Times reported. According to James Hardy, the Asia Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly magazine, this type of UAV can only travel limited distances. ""It has quite a small range, it doesn't have very long endurance so it would only be up there for a few hours. You would use those to see what the other guys are doing in a battlefield environment. So it's very useful in terms of knowing what's going on behind the next hill, or the next mountain or even over the other side of a wall."" Most armies have unmanned vehicles like these to varying degrees, says Hardy, but they're not designed to be armed. ""They're very much closely built off a remote-controlled aircraft that you can buy in a toy store. They're just a militarized version of that,"" Hardy said. 11 North Koreans missing after cargo ship sinks . Flying bombs? North Korea has flaunted similar, larger UAVs at military parades in recent years. These target drones are designed to test how well pilots can shoot at a moving object, or the accuracy of missiles. But it seems the North Koreans have reverse-engineered them with explosives, says Hardy. ""The way in which those have been used or have been modified by some countries is that they put an explosive in the front, so they do turn it into a flying bomb or a flying missile. So it's got a one-way mission -- you can fly it somewhere and then you can crash it."" Video footage shows North Korean exercises uses them for this purpose, but it's an expensive way to build a bomb, says Hardy. ""You get one use out of it."" The explosion, depending on the charge and the level of sophistication of the charge, would be only big enough to take out a single vehicle or a ship. ""UAVs are a major part of the modern battlefield. We just have to look at how the U.S. uses them in Pakistan and Yemen and Afghanistan, but the UAVs that the U.S. is using are significantly more sophisticated. There's no comparison really."" Some analysts have also suggested North Korea could use UAVs to carry out a chemical or biological attack on the South. But Hardy doubts it would come to that. ""If North Korea did a chemical or biological attack on South Korea in any kind of situation, the United States and South Korea would respond with a massive amount of force...You would have the world's largest military on your doorstep very quickly."" South Korea investigates two suspected North Korean drones . South Korea bolsters air defense network . The discovery of the drones comes amid mounting tensions across the 38th parallel. Annual U.S.-South Korean joint military drills that ended on April 7, drew criticism from North Korea, which views the exercises as ""dress rehearsals for invasion,"" according to James Person, coordinator of the North Korean International Documentation Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center. Two weeks ago, Pyongyang fired two mid-range ballistics missiles off its eastern coast, in apparent response to the drills. Days later, the two sides exchanged hundreds of shells across the Northern Limit Line, their disputed maritime border, after North Korea warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device. ""This time of year is provocation season,"" says Hardy. ""It's all good stuff because it allows the North Koreans to do something provocative and slightly annoying which might embarrass South Koreans, but it's not provocative enough to create a proper military response."" But South Korea is taking precautions to secure its airspace. In a weekly meeting with senior aides Monday, South Korea's President Park Keun Hye warned that insecurities among many citizens, especially those living near the border, are growing in light of the recent provocations from North Korea. ""Drones suspected of belonging to North Korea appeared to have spied in all directions, but our military authorities were completely in the dark about this,"" she said. ""I think there are problems with the air defense and ground reconnaissance systems. ""We should view it seriously that North Korea has fired missiles and strengthened reconnaissance. To prepare for the possibility of additional provocations, we need to come up with measures to immediately block and repel any provocations."" On Monday, South Korea's military launched an expansive search for further drones. Two days later, a spokesperson for the defense ministry told CNN that South Korea plans to purchase low-altitude radar to improve the country's ability to detect small UAVs. He declined to say how many or where the radar would come from. South Korea's own reconnaissance drone program includes a deal to buy four Global Hawk UAVs from Northrop Grunman Corp for over $800 million. Person, from the Woodrow Wilson Center says that if the drones are from North Korea, it is a violation of the armistice agreement and South Korea should be concerned that its airspace was violated. ""But given just how low-tech these things are, I don't think South Korean officials are so very concerned right now,"" he said. Stella Kim reported from Seoul; Sophie Brown reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","South Korea suspects that three drones discovered in recent weeks belong to North Korea .
The unmanned aircraft are fitted with digital cameras, difficult to detect with radar .
Experts say the drones are low-tech and pose little threat .

"(CNN) -- A single lethal injection was supposed to speedily end Joseph Wood's life last week. When it didn't, Arizona executioners gave him a total of 15 doses of a novel drug cocktail, according to prison documents released Friday. It took nearly two hours for Wood to die, as he gulped and snarled for air, journalists attending the execution said. Arizona's attorney general has temporarily halted executions after the convicted murderer's prolonged death. Republican Sen. John McCain has called it tantamount to torture. Gov. Jan Brewer called for an internal investigation by the corrections department. But on Friday, Democratic state Sen. Ed Ableser added his voice to those of critics calling the execution ""botched"" and saying that it is not enough for the corrections department, which carried it out, to investigate itself. He repeated the call for an independent investigation. Experts: Protocol not followed . Two lawyers not connected to the case and who looked at the execution protocol late Friday agreed. Richard Dieter heads the Death Penalty Information Center. It looks into legal snares and discrimination surrounding the application of the death penalty but neither supports nor opposes it per se, Dieter said. ""An execution itself should be humane and constitutional,"" he said. This execution went wrong. It did not follow protocol, in his opinion. ""Instead of applying that (single injection) and saying it didn't work, they kept applying doses."" The state used midazolam, an anesthetic, and hydromorphone, a narcotic painkiller which, with an overdose, halts breathing and stops the heart from beating. It's one of the new combinations that states have tried -- with some controversial results -- after manufacturers based or operating in Europe prevented U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. Instead of conceding failure with the relatively new drug mixture, they kept trying to kill Wood with repeated doses, Dieter said. Megan McCraken, a legal analyst from the University of California, Berkeley, helps defense attorneys fight lethal injection verdicts. ""The bungled execution of Joseph Wood is unprecedented and without compare,"" she said. Wood was supposed to receive one dose only. ""The department violated its protocol,"" she said after reviewing the corrections document. Opinion: 5 ways to improve the U.S. death penalty . Eric Holder reviewing execution methods . Both lawyers said that the state should have made the protocol and drugs used public before the execution and given experts a chance to weigh in on their effectiveness. Death penalty proponents have argued that doing so allows death penalty opponents to pick execution methods apart, possibly preventing them. ""I'm greatly troubled,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told PBS Newshour on Thursday. He has been tasked with a national review of the death penalty methods after botched executions involving midazolam. Making the injection protocol public ahead of time is not legally required, he said. But his moral convictions were in line with the critics'. ""It seems to me, just on a personal level, that transparency would be a good thing,"" he said. Arizona execution raises questions over novel lethal injections . Sen. McCain has told Politico that he supports the death penalty in some cases, but he said Wood's execution was carried out in a ""terrible"" way. ""The lethal injection needs to be an indeed lethal injection and not the bollocks-upped situation that just prevailed. That's torture,"" he said. Corrections department defends actions . In the immediate wake of the execution, the corrections department issued a statement saying that it had gone according to procedure. Wood was deeply sedated the entire time, it said. State officials and relatives of the convicted killer's two victims disagreed that he had been gasping for air, saying Wood snored and didn't appear to be in agony. Reports that the execution was botched are ""erroneous,"" Corrections Director Charles Ryan said. Jeanne Brown, a close relative of Wood's victims, said he got what he deserved.

"(LifeWire)  -- Fifty years ago this Saturday, Laika -- a sweet-tempered stray plucked off the streets of Moscow  -- was thrust into the global spotlight when she became the first living creature sent into space. A Newfoundland,  like this champion named Josh, saved the life of Napoleon Bonaparte. When Sputnik 2's canine passenger (nicknamed ""Muttnik"" by the media) hit orbit, the Soviet Union grabbed the edge over the U.S. in the space race, a crux of competition during the Cold War. Sadly, Laika's history-making voyage ended prematurely: In their rush to be first, Soviet scientists had made no provisions for her safe return. ""She died before reaching orbit, and before any real data was gleaned about sustaining life in that environment,"" says Dr. Stanley Coren, professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and author of ""The Pawprints of History: Dogs and the Course of Human Events."" But if little scientific knowledge was gleaned from Laika's journey, her mark on world events is undeniable. ""We were behind the Russians,"" says Coren. ""The U.S. quickly switched focus to putting a living being on the moon."" Laika is just one of the many canines to have left a furry legacy behind. Coren names 10 other dogs and the roles they played in history. Nos. 1 and 2. Strelka and Belka's successful orbit . Laika was the first dog sent into space, but Strelka (Little Arrow) and Belka  (Squirrel) -- launched on Sputnik 5 in 1960 for a one-day mission -- were the first to return alive. As a result, much more was learned from their mission. Strelka later gave birth to a litter of puppies, one of which, Pushinka, was given to President John F. Kennedy's daughter, Caroline. No. 3. How Peritas saved civilization . Without his dog, Peritas, Alexander the Great might have been Alexander the So-So. When the warrior was swarmed by the troops of Persia's Darius III, Peritas leapt and bit the lip of an elephant charging his master. Alexander lived to pursue his famed conquest, forging the empire underlying Western civilization as we know it. No. 4. Charlie, Kennedy's Cuban Missile Crisis companion . At the height of 1962's Cuban missile crisis, President Kennedy had his son's Welsh terrier Charlie summoned to the chaotic War Room. The president held the terrier in his lap, petting him and appearing, by all accounts, to relax. Eventually he announced that he was ready to ""make some decisions"" -- those that de-escalated the conflict. No. 5. Jofi, the first therapy dog . Sigmund Freud usually kept a chow named Jofi in his office during psychotherapy sessions, believing the dog comforted the patients. Freud's notes on these interactions, detailed in his diaries, form the basis of modern-day pet-assisted therapy.  Dog returned to fire victims » . No. 6. Urian bites Pope, separates church and state . Henry VIII sent Cardinal Wolsey to meet with Pope Clement VII, hoping the pontiff would grant the ruler an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. When the pope extended his bare toe to be kissed (as was the custom) by Wolsey, the Cardinal's dog, Urian, sprang forward and bit the pope. Clement flew into a rage, the divorce was off and Henry -- to ensure the annulment the Catholic Church refused to grant -- later established the Church of England. No. 7. Newfoundland saves Napoleon . Napoleon Bonaparte owed his life to a nameless Newfoundland. As Bonaparte fled the island of Elba in 1815, where he was exiled, choppy seas pitched him overboard. A fisherman's dog jumped in after the drowning despot and kept him afloat. Napoleon lived to experience his own defeat at the Battle of Waterloo. No. 8. Nixon professes love for Checkers . In his 1952 ""Checkers speech,"" Richard Nixon -- then a candidate for vice president who was accused of pawing $18,000 in illegal campaign contributions -- admitted to accepting an American cocker spaniel, Checkers, as a gift. ""And you know, the kids, like all kids, loved the dog, and I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we are going to keep it,"" Nixon said during his famous speech. His heartfelt proclamation swayed public opinion and prolonged Nixon's political career. No. 9. Peps, Wagner's harshest critic . Without Peps, composer Richard Wagner's Cavalier King Charles spaniel, that helicopter scene in the film ""Apocalypse Now"" (scored to ""The Ride of the Valkyries"") might sound very different. Wagner would have Peps sit on a special chair as he played his latest compositions and, based upon the dog's reactions, he'd keep or toss each passage. No. 10. Donnchadh and the American Revolution . In 1306, when Edward I of England sought to bring down Robert the Bruce (and his ploy to rule Scotland), his men used Robert's own dog, Donnchadh, to find him. Though the animal led them to their target, he then turned and defended his master, who lived to become king of Scotland and produce a daughter who married into the Stuart family. Many generations later, the irrational actions of Robert the Bruce's direct descendant, King George III, would cause the American colonists to rebel. Modern medicine attributes King George's apparent madness to porphyria, a genetically transmitted disease that researchers trace back to the Scottish Stuarts. E-mail to a friend .

"(LonelyPlanet.com) -- Despite the fact that it seems to be in the news almost every day of the week, China -- impossibly vast and fascinatingly diverse -- remains a travel destination with an unquestionable mystique. As exciting as that sounds, it also makes travelling to China for the first time an incredibly daunting prospect. To help you venture into the unknown, here's our first-timer's guide to the most populated land on the planet. LonelyPlanet.com: A tasty tour of China . 1. Break the language barrier . The number one hurdle to overcome when travelling around China is the language barrier. Even today, with Chinese children learning English from primary school onwards, it's a barrier that can be almost completely impenetrable at times. It's always advisable to try to learn a few words and phrases before you visit far-flung lands, but in China it's almost essential. Try to enroll in Mandarin classes before you go (Mandarin Chinese is the default language in almost every part of China), or try to teach yourself some of the basics -- the BBC website has a decent introduction to learning Chinese. Then, when you leave for China, be sure to bring with you one or more of the following: . -Mandarin Chinese phrasebook - Lonely Planet and other guidebook publishers offer them. -English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English pocket dictionary - I found the Oxford version very easy to use when I was a beginner. -Translator apps - Google Translate is free and includes an impressively accurate speak-your-phrase voice translator. The Lonely Planet Chinese Translator app is similar but has the advantage of being entirely offline with a dictionary tailored to the needs of travelers. Regardless of all of the above, one thing you should always do when traveling around China is carry with you Chinese-language business cards of your hotel or of places you wish to visit so you can show passers-by, taxi drivers, bus conductors and the like. 2. Focus your itinerary . China is massive. Really, it's unbelievably large. It contains the world's highest mountains, some of the world's largest deserts, remote jungles, seemingly endless grasslands, and, of course, many of the world's largest cities. You would need months and months of traveling to even begin to do it justice. So, rather than skimming the surface of the whole country on your first trip, choose one region, or even just one province, and explore it properly. Do some preliminary research to get a basic sense of each region. Still unsure? Here's my top three: . -Sichuan: One province; three regions. Stay in the center or the south for steamy bamboo forests and cute Ming-Dynasty villages. Head north for stunning lakes set among alpine-esque mountain scenery. Venture west for remote Tibetan-plateau grasslands. -Guangxi: Picture-perfect rice terraces and otherworldly karst peaks dominate a lush, almost jungle-like landscape which is perfect for hiking, cycling and river trips. -Beijing: Don't just fly here, stay here. Beijing packs in more world-class sites than many whole countries are able to offer: The Great Wall, Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, ancient hutong alleyways, majestic imperial parks...the list goes on and on. 3. Check the weather . At any time of the year there are places in China that enjoy ideal weather for travel, but almost nowhere is weather-perfect all year round. So to ensure your first trip to China doesn't become a wind-beaten blowout, an energy-sapping sun-scorcher or just a damp squib, get on top of where's hot and where's not in the month you're planning to travel. Generally speaking spring and autumn are the most comfortable seasons, although not in all provinces, and in many parts of China spring and autumn are no more than a few weeks long. For starters, check out this China weather rundown. LonelyPlanet.com: Top 10 works of engineering genius . 4. Use public transport . Ditch the taxis and the airplanes and hop on buses, bikes and trains to see China how the locals see it. Sure, it's easier flying from city to city, and then taking a taxi around each one once you're there. But where's the fun in it? China's public transport systems are already extensive, and getting bigger and better every year and many towns and cities are well set up for cycling -- cycle lanes abound in Beijing, for instance. And don't worry about getting lost. Chinese people in general are extremely friendly, helpful and honest, especially to foreigners who can't speak Chinese, so there will always be a local on hand to put you back on track if you lose your way. 5. Eat, eat and then eat some more . China has many wonderful features but arguably its standout attraction is its food. Cuisine varies tremendously from region to region -- even breakfast time can be an assault on the senses -- so try as much of it as you can. And don't listen to anyone who tells you to avoid the street food. It's often the best part of a city's culinary experience. One final food tip from my aunt, who recently visited China for the first time: If you're not used to using chopsticks, ditch the white T-shirts and pack more dark-colored tops. Noodle-slurping stains are an unavoidable nuisance for most China first-timers, and asking for a knife and fork in a restaurant over here...well, that's just cheating.

"(CNN) -- Copenhagen's red light district pulsates with neon lights. Women stand on nearly every corner -- many from Africa -- aggressively making their pitch to men walking by. Inside one particularly loud bar, young Thai women sit on the laps of male customers. And Stockholm? Well, you might walk right by its equivalent and never notice. Malmskillnadsgatan is a commercial area, the address of several banks. In its heyday, dozens of girls used to ply their trade here. Now, you can find only three or four women who work the street. That stark difference may explain why Sweden is being hailed as a model of how to combat sex trafficking, while Denmark has been called the ""Brothel of Scandinavia"". So, what happened? In 1995, Sweden passed a tough bill that cracked down on prostitution. What made this law different, however, was who would be held responsible for the crime of prostitution. It's not illegal to sell sex. It is, however, illegal to buy sex. The law was enacted as part of Sweden's push for gender equality. From a Swedish legal point of view, any woman selling sex has been forced to do so, either by circumstance or coercion. Anyone caught buying sex faces hefty fines, an embarrassingly public police notification and possible time in prison, with a maximum four-year sentence. So far no one arrested has served time. According to the Swedish justice ministry, more than 70% in recent polls supported the law. Buying sex is looked down upon. There is even a slang term for those who buy sex. ""They're called a ""cod,"" a fish,"" says Lise Tamm, a Swedish prosecutor of organized crime. ""It's the same word as a loser, or [someone who] gets called by the police, or runs out of gas in his car. You're a loser if you buy sex in Sweden. ""We see it as a human right to have sexual integrity, physical integrity, and not to be forced to sell your body to strange men, 10 times a day. That's human rights to us."" At first, Sweden's neighbours in Europe dismissed the idea. But the law had an interesting knock-on effect, decreasing demand for prostitution and thereby sex trafficking. Kajsa Wahlberg, Sweden's National Rapporteur on Human Trafficking, has undertaken annual assessments on the problem since the law was enacted. She recalls attending international meetings back in 1998 when Sweden was ridiculed for its approach. ""I mean, I was told you can't do that. It's impossible,"" she recalls. ""People could not even get it into their minds that it would have any effect on trafficking. But now I get the impression that people have stopped laughing and actually are looking seriously into what can we do."" Police say it's working; that customers don't want to risk punishment and that intelligence indicated pimps and traffickers quickly realized it was not worth bringing women into Sweden. Simply, there is not enough money to be made and the risk is too high. But trafficking still exists and women still sell sex in Sweden. One young woman told CNN she was promised a cleaning job in Sweden -- but within hours of arriving in the country she was locked in an apartment, raped and beaten and had her passport taken away from her. While street prostitution has dropped dramatically, selling sex over the internet is still a thriving industry. But Stockholm police estimate that there are only about 200 prostitutes now working in a capital city of more than 2 million people. It's all in stark contrast to Copenhagen. Denmark decriminalized prostitution in 1999. The idea, in part, was that making it legal to sell sex would also make it easier to police. There are conditions, however: pimping is illegal and only legal residents can work as prostitutes. Since then, Copenhagen's red light district has grown. The women walking the streets have also changed. About half used to be Danish, according to national police. Now most are African or from eastern Europe. There are no hard numbers on how many have been trafficked but social workers believe the vast majority are ""vulnerable"" to trafficking. Michelle Mildwater, an anti-trafficking activist with Hope Now, walks the streets of Copenhagen almost every night, hoping to reach out to victims. She says she has seen the number of prostitutes from Africa triple in just two years, although specific numbers are difficult. ""What we've got on the streets is the tip of the iceberg basically,"" she says. The reality in Copenhagen is that the majority of prostitutes are managed by pimps, even though it's illegal. Complicating matters, many of the pimps and traffickers are themselves prostitutes, attempting to work their way out of the street by managing new recruits. ""We thought that these women would be trapped and kidnapped and they wanted to be saved and rescued and they wanted to go back home,"" says Anne Maskell of the Danish Centre Against Human Trafficking. ""But what we found out is that this is a much more complex phenomenon."" Danish police have to figure out which prostitutes are in the country illegally, which prostitutes may be victims of trafficking and which prostitutes may also be pimps and traffickers. They believe that 95% of the prostitutes in Denmark are already familiar with prostitution when they arrive, know they need to cooperate with pimps to get on, and are not used to working with law enforcement. The police try to establish which of the prostitutes are there legally: those who are not will be transferred to the department that deals with illegal immigrants. Denmark's National Centre Against Trafficking coordinates police and social services to effectively identify trafficking victims. When police raid a brothel, social workers are on hand. When they have identified a possible victim of trafficking, they are placed in a safe house for a ""reflection period"" of up to 100 days. If, at the end of that time, the victims have not cooperated with police to prosecute their traffickers, they are deported. ""Of course, we tell them [that] in the hope that they will tell us at least a little bit of the true story,"" says Maskell. ""Because of course many of them are scared to tell their stories. And they're also scared that the authorities get to know about them."" But most victims fail to cooperate, too scared to testify against their traffickers, walking out of safe houses and disappearing just before their ""reflection period"" ends. Politicians in Denmark are now debating whether to adopt a Swedish-style approach to the problem. In Sweden justice ministry officials say they have had an increase for requests from other countries to explain how their anti-prostitution law works and how it might be adapted. ""The important thing is that any country should think about the question on demand."" says Beatrice Ask, Sweden's minister of justice, ""because you can't fight this organized criminality, which is often behind prostitution and trafficking for sexual purposes. You can't fight that by only looking to one side of the coin. If we could get rid of slavery, then I think this type of buying human beings is something that we have to fight too.""","Scandinavian neighbors Denmark and Sweden have taken different approaches to sex trafficking .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Oh no, he didn't go there. Even in a political climate where it sometimes appears that anything goes, Bill Richardson crossed the line. When the former New Mexico governor recently attacked Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, for -- in essence -- not being Hispanic enough, or not being the right kind of Hispanic, Richardson went too far. Way too far. During a web interview after an appearance on ABC News' ""This Week,"" the Democrat was asked about Cruz and said this: . ""I'm not a fan. I know (Cruz is) sort of the Republican latest flavor. He's articulate. He seems to be charismatic, but I don't like his politics. I think he introduces a measure of incivility in the political process. Insulting people is not the way to go."" Then, Richardson insulted Cruz. He was asked if he thought the senator represents most Hispanics. That's a dumb question. Cruz has never claimed to represent ""most Hispanics."" Besides, can you imagine someone asking if an Anglo politician represents most Anglos? Yet, Richardson played along. ""No, no,"" he said. ""He's anti-immigration. Almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform. No, I don't think he should be defined as a Hispanic. He's a politician from Texas. A conservative state."" Since leaving government, Richardson obviously has time on his hands and so he has volunteered to assume the burden of sorting through 52 million Hispanics in the United States and deciding which of us are authentic and which aren't. You have to respect the initiative. For the record, Cruz doesn't think that illegal immigrants should get a path to citizenship, calling it ""inconsistent with the rule of law and is profoundly unfair to the millions of legal immigrants who have followed the rules and waited in line for years, and sometimes decades, to come here legally."" I disagree with most of what Cruz has said about immigration. But I wouldn't say that he is ""anti-immigration."" That's crazy. He is the son of an immigrant. Cruz' father, Rafael, who the senator says has been his hero his entire life, left Cuba in 1957 at age 18. The elder Cruz came to the United States not speaking English, with $100 to his name and washed dishes for 50 cents an hour. I once asked Cruz how he would solve the immigration problem. ""No. 1: We need to get serious about securing the border, about stopping illegal immigration, particularly in a post-9/11 world,"" he said. ""But No. 2, we also need to remain a nation that doesn't just welcome but that celebrates legal immigrants who come here seeking to pursue the American dream."" That doesn't sound ""anti-immigration"" to me. By the way, Richardson's father, William Blaine Richardson, Jr., was raised in Boston and worked as an executive at American Citibank. He later worked for the bank in Mexico City, where he met and married Maria Luisa Lopez-Collada Marquez, Richardson's mother. Bill was born in Southern California. By the time Richardson made his way to New Mexico and into politics, he wasn't exactly greeted with mariachis and margaritas by the politicos whose families had, in some cases, lived in the Land of Enchantment for 300 years. Richardson speaks excellent Spanish, but he still had to convince native New Mexicans that he was authentically Mexican-American. He goes by ""Bill"" not ""Guillermo,"" and ""Richardson"" isn't a typical Hispanic surname. So Richardson should know better than to question someone else's authenticity. In his eagerness to score a point for Team Blue by sniping at a rising star in the GOP, the Democrat wandered into territory that should be off-limits. For Hispanics, this is our soft spot. We pull each other down, crabs in a bucket. And our modus operandi hasn't evolved in 500 years: We always make it personal. We can't just disagree; we discredit. And we do it by accusing each other of being less authentic than we are. The whole subject is taboo. On Monday, during another interview, Richardson said his comments were misinterpreted and that what he meant to say is simply that Cruz ""shouldn't be defined just as a Hispanic"" because there is more to him than that. If that's where he meant to go, he took the long way there. If Hispanics want to attack Ted Cruz, fine. Have at it. But attack him for his policies, his politics and his public statements. Not his ethnic authenticity. As for the territory that is off-limits, I know it well. Memory carries me back to my freshman year in college where, 28 years ago, I indulged in an unfortunate ritual for Hispanic students. It might as well be called: ""I'm a real Hispanic, you're a coconut."" Brown on the outside, but white on the inside. Insecure about my ethnic identity, in part because I attended a predominantly white university, I lashed out at fellow Hispanic students. If they had conservative views, I would say they ""didn't identify"" and accuse them of not being Hispanic enough. Ironically, some of the people I attacked probably spoke Spanish better than I did. The whole exercise was childish, rude and wrong. And by senior year, when I began to challenge the liberal orthodoxy that many Hispanics worship, I got a taste of my own medicine. I don't play that game anymore. I grew up. In politics, not everyone has. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette, Jr.","Ruben Navarrette: Bill Richardson crossed line by implying Ted Cruz not Hispanic .

"(CNN) -- A Delaware deputy attorney general resigned Monday after he was arrested and charged with raping a 16-year-old boy he allegedly met through a popular gay dating app. Daniel Simmons, 34, was arrested Friday and charged with four counts of rape in the fourth degree. He was released Friday after posting $45,000 bail, according to the New Castle County Police Department. Simmons met the teen on the popular gay dating app Grindr, according to New Castle County Police. The app, launched in 2009, is a social, location-based mobile app designed to connect gay and bisexual men, according to its website. Police began investigating Simmons in March after receiving a tip from someone who became aware of the alleged incident. The investigation continued until police officers went to Simmons' office on Friday to interview him. They arrested him the same day, said Officer Tracy Duffy, a spokeswoman for the New Castle County Police. Simmons was placed on administrative leave after his arrest and resigned from his post Monday. He had been a deputy attorney general assigned to the New Castle County Misdemeanor Trial Unit since November 2006, agency spokesman Jason Miller told CNN. State prosecutor Kathleen Jennings released a statement Monday saying, ""We are deeply disturbed by the conduct alleged in this case. We are most concerned for the welfare of the victim. This case will be vigorously pursued to justice. Ethically, we are prohibited from saying more."" It is unclear whether Simmons has hired an attorney. Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, the son of Vice President Joe Biden, has not commented on the case.","Deputy attorney general charged with four counts of rape in the fourth degree .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- An 87-year-old Georgia woman, who was found dead in Lake Oconee 10 days after the discovery of her husband's headless body, appears to have been killed before being dumped in the lake. It's the latest twist in a grisly case that has baffled authorities. Shirley Dermond did not drown but rather died from a ""blunt impact injury to the head,"" Putnam County Coroner Gary McElhenney said Saturday. The coroner's finding came a day after authorities pulled Dermond's body from the lake about 80 miles east of Atlanta. McElhenney did not offer any further details about what might have been used to kill her before she was placed in the water or whether she suffered any additional trauma. The decapitated body of her husband, 88-year-old Russell Dermond, was discovered May 6 in the garage of the couple's million-dollar waterfront home after friends went to check on them. From the beginning, investigators treated Dermond's disappearance as an abduction. Her purse, cell phone and car were all still at home. Authorities believe she was taken from her home after her husband was killed, sometime between May 2 and May 4. Investigators continue to search for Russell Dermond's head, and they plan to look in the area where Shirley Dermond's body was found, Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills has said. Authorities were alerted by two fishermen who spotted what they believed to be a body in the lake, five or six miles from the couple's home. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report .","NEW: Shirley Dermond, 87, did not drown, a coroner says .

"(CNN) -- Hacking your Xbox: So easy, even a 5-year-old could do it? A San Diego boy has the gaming world's attention after he exposed a security flaw that let him log into his dad's Xbox Live account, without permission, on the family's Xbox One console. ""I was like ... yeah!"" young Kristoffer Von Hassel said to KGTV-10, a CNN affiliate. Kristoffer's father, Robert Davies, noticed soon after Christmas that his son was logging into his account and playing games that weren't appropriate for his age. When he asked how, Kristoffer showed him a hack that seems simple in retrospect but is fairly impressive considering a 5-year-old found it. Kristoffer would go to his dad's account and type in an incorrect password. That would take him to a password verifications screen, where he would simply tap the space bar repeatedly and then press ""enter."" ""How awesome is that?"" asked Davies, who works in online security himself. ""Just being 5 years old and being able to find a vulnerability and latch on to that. I thought that was pretty cool."" He told KGTV that Kristoffer has figured out three or four other ""hacks,"" including getting past the lock on a smartphone by holding down the ""home"" key for long enough. Dad reported the vulnerability to Microsoft. And Microsoft acted, issuing a fix for the vulnerability. ""We're always listening to our customers and thank them for bringing issues to our attention,"" the company said in a written statement. ""We take security seriously at Xbox and fixed the issue as soon as we learned about it."" The company has even included Kristoffer's name on a list of security researchers who have helped make online Microsoft products safer. For his discovery (or, more accurately, for reporting it with his father's help), Kristoffer will receive four games, $50 and a year's subscription to Xbox Live from Microsoft. Whether a career in computer security awaits remains to be seen.","A 5-year-old California boy hacked his father's Xbox Live account .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Imagine if cars ran on household waste, if gas tanks were filled with ethanol made from wood chips. Well, the technology to make it happen is already a reality and companies are now racing to bring this kind of fuel to a gas pump near you. Waste wood can be used to produce ethanol to fuel cars. With the right processing, ethanol can be produced from pretty much any form of organic matter. Cellulosic ethanol is made from the cellulose found in waste materials like wood chips and the non-edible parts of food crops, or from purpose-grown grasses such as switchgrass and miscanthus. These grasses can be grown on land unsuitable for food production, meaning they're not in competition with food crops, and the whole plant can be used to produce fuel, making them a more efficient use of land than traditional biofuels. Because cellulosic ethanol takes much less energy to produce than traditional biofuels, it's an even greener alternative to gasoline. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, cellulosic ethanol produces 85% less greenhouse gases than gasoline. So far, the production of cellulosic ethanol has been limited to pilot plants demonstrating that the technology works, but a number of companies have announced plans to build commercial-scale plants. INEOS Bio, an offshoot of UK-based chemical company INEOS, is soon to announce the location of its first commercial plant, which will produce ethanol from waste materials. The INEOS Bio method involves superheating biomass to produce a synthesis gas that is converted to ethanol by microbes, meaning it utilizes the lignin content of the waste as well as the cellulose. ""We can use a wide range of materials but we want to stick with biodegradable materials. That could be household waste, garden waste, agricultural waste or forestry waste,"" a spokesperson for INEOS Bio told CNN. ""One of the exciting things is that a production plant could well be in a big city, allied to their waste disposal issues. We can take waste and rather than put it into landfill, we can turn it into ethanol. ""This is not a specialist thing; it's not for a few people here and there. We believe we'll be able to mass produce this for millions of cars. And if you use ethanol as a blend with gasoline, which is how it's most commonly used, you could find almost every car is one day running on this,"" the spokesperson added. How do you think our cars will be fuelled in the future? Governments have already committed to using biofuels of some kind as a substitute for gasoline. The EU has required that 10% of petrol and diesel will come from renewable sources by 2020 and the U.S. is aiming to produce 36 billion gallons of biofuel annually by 2022. Currently, biofuels are mostly produced from sugar cane, grain or oil-seed crops, but increasing demand for biofuels has meant an increasing demand for the crops used to make them, and that demand has been blamed for driving up global food prices. There have also been claims that biofuel production in developing countries is accelerating the destruction of rain forests and doubts have been raised about the effectiveness of traditional biofuels in reducing greenhouse gases. The result is that attention is now turning to producing biofuels from other sources. INEOS is one of the world's largest chemical companies and the involvement of big corporations is a sign that the technology is being taken seriously. General Motors has joined forces with U.S. firms Mascoma and Coskata, and Dupont has teamed up with Genencor to develop cellulosic ethanol, promising $140 million of funding for the project. But cost is king and according to Neil Harl, emeritus professor of economics at Iowa State University, price is ultimately what will determine if cellulosic ethanol becomes the fuel of the future. ""You have to do more than demonstrate that it can be done, you have to show that it can be done profitably,"" says Harl, citing a 2007 IMF report on biofuels that describes cellulosic ethanol as twice as expensive to produce as gasoline and 75% more expensive than corn-based ethanol.

"(CNN) -- In an uncharacteristically personal address, Apple CEO Tim Cook is speaking out about civil rights, saying equality for all is ""at the core of my beliefs and values."" The speech came when Cook was accepting a lifetime achievement award from Auburn University, his alma mater, in New York City last week. He said he recalled seeing a cross burning, a symbol of racism, during the turbulent civil-rights struggles of the 1960s in Alabama. ""This image was permanently imprinted in my brain and it would change my life forever,"" he said. ""I could never understand it, but I knew then that America's, and Alabama's, history would always be scarred by the hatred that it represented."" Cook called on Congress to act on immigration reform and to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2013, which would ""demand equality and non-discrimination for all employees, regardless of who they love."" His comments at times took on a personal tone. ""I have seen and I have experienced many other types of discrimination, and all of them were rooted in the fear of people that were different than the majority,"" he said. He said working at Apple has been different. ""I was very fortunate that my life's journey took me to Apple,"" Cook said. ""In addition to finding a company and a founder unlike any other, I found at Apple a company that deeply believed in advancing humanity, through its products and through the equality of all of its employees."" Cook said Apple works to ensure all of its products are accessible to people with physical and mental disabilities, not to make more money but ""because it is just and right."" Apple is one of several Silicon Valley companies that have been vocal on civil issues like immigration reform, nondiscrimination and same-sex marriage. Last year, Google launched a campaign called ""Legalize Love,"" dedicated to LGBT rights. Apple has donated money to the fight against California's Proposition 8, which would have banned gay marriage. Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon also have been involved in similar efforts. On a separate note, Cook began his comments by referencing another issue of import to the room full of Auburn faithful. ""I'm going to make my comments brief, but I may ask for one extra second at the end, because we all know what a difference that can make,"" he said. In a dramatic football game two weeks ago, Auburn defeated archrival Alabama when the Crimson Tide attempted a game-winning field goal with one second remaining, only to see Auburn's Chris Davis return the missed kick 109 yards for an improbable victory. The win helped catapult Auburn to next month's national championship game.","Apple CEO Tim Cook said equality is ""at the core of my beliefs""

"(CNN) -- A Canadian 14-year-old completed a nearly 27-hour, 31.6-mile solo swim across Lake Ontario on Sunday, becoming the youngest person ever to make the trek. As Annaleise Carr approached the Toronto shore, her red swimming cap bobbing up and down as she swam freestyle, a crowd of supporters cheered and clapped. As they watched her approach shore they chanted, ""You can do it, Annaleise! You can do it, Annaleise!"" Annaleise began her charity swim at 6:17 p.m. ET Saturday at Niagara-on-the-Lake. She climbed out of the water at Toronto's Marilyn Bell Park two minutes before 9 p.m. Sunday. The teenager did not speak to the gathered crowd after her swim, instead going to the hospital for a standard check-up, a spokesman said. 62-year-old tries Cuba-to-Florida swim again . Staff in a kayak and an inflatable boat accompanied her to shore. CNN affiliate CTV said Annaliese was allowed breaks during her swim so she could eat, but she had to stay in the water. The teenager did her swim for charity, aiming to raise $30,000 for Camp Trillium, a childhood cancer center. As of 5:23 p.m. Sunday, she had raised close to $80,000, according to her parents, who were updating her progress online each step of the way. ""Unbelievable!!!!!"" her parents wrote on her website, Annaleise's Lake Ontario Crossing. ""We are so proud!!!"" The first person to swim across Lake Ontario was 16-year-old Marilyn Bell in 1954, according to Swim Ontario, the sport's provincial governing body. Nearly 50 other swimmers have completed the swim since then, but Annaleise is the youngest, according to Solo Swims of Ontario, a non-profit group that monitors the safety of long-distance swims. One of the solo Lake Ontario swimmers was Diana Nyad, who on Sunday was attempting to swim from Florida to Cuba. The 62-year-old Nyad -- who completed her Lake Ontario swim in 1974 at the age of 24 -- was a third of the way to her goal as of Sunday evening. In Annaleise's last blog post before setting off, she said she was well rested after sleeping nearly 12 hours the night before. She wrote, ""Dad says he thinks I have ice in my veins :) I guess we'll find out because the lake flipped yesterday and I'm looking at very cold water in Toronto now! I'll do my best to deal with anything that comes my way...not just the cold!"" Annaleise says on her site that she has swum competitively since she was 4 and that distance swimming has always been her passion. She began swimming in the lake three or four years ago and said competing in open water is ""way quieter"" than in a pool. She says she chose Lake Ontario for her swim because it's one of the hardest open-water swims in the world, and she wanted to ""accomplish something difficult"" for children who fight cancer.

"(CNN) -- Does the computer breach at Target have the makings of a movie? Throw in a shotgun-toting security analyst, Russian hackers, drugs and a SWAT team and Hollywood appears to think so. Sony has bought the rights to a New York Times article about Brian Krebs, the security blogger who was the first to expose December's security breach at Target, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The article, ""Reporting From the Web's Underbelly,"" was written by Nicole Perlroth and details how Krebs' blog about cybercrime has prompted criminals to hack him repeatedly, send heroin and excrement to his home and falsely accuse him of murder. Hence, the 12-gauge shotgun he keeps by his side while writing. ""A lot of what Brian does would scare the hell out of traditional newsroom editors,"" Russ Walker, Krebs's former editor at The Washington Post, said in the Times article. ""I don't think he crossed the lines journalistically, but he was living a different type of experience."" The movie is expected to be a cyberthriller written by Richard Wenk, whose credits include ""16 Blocks,"" ""The Mechanic"" and ""The Expendables 2."" Krebs himself seems amused by the notion that his life and unglamorous work may soon be dramatized by Hollywood. ""Judging from accounts of the screenwriter's other movies, if this flick actually gets made someone vaguely resembling me probably will be kicking some badguy butt on the Silver Screen,"" he wrote Friday in a post on his security blog. ""I still have yet to work out the details with Sony, but beyond remuneration (and perhaps a fleeting Hitchcock-style cameo) I would be delighted if I could influence the selection of the leading man,"" he added. ""In the past week, I've been told I look like both Jim Carrey and Guy Pierce, but I'm not so sure. But if I had to pick one of my favorite actors, I'd love to see Edward Norton in the role.""

"(CNN) -- Syrian state-run television reported Thursday that forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad killed three Westerners, including an American woman and a British citizen, who it claims were fighting with the rebels and were found with weapons. Syrian TV identified the woman, releasing what it claimed were images of her Michigan driver's license and U.S. passport. It also released what is said was the name and passport of a British citizen. It did not identify a third person who it claimed was a Westerner. The report said the three were ambushed in their car in the flashpoint province of Idlib in northwestern Syria, where government forces have been battling rebels for control. TV footage showed a bullet-riddled car and three bodies laid out. It also showed weapons, a computer, a hand-drawn map of a government military facility and a flag belonging to the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front. The United States is aware of the claim that an American woman was killed and is working through the Czech Republic mission in Syria to obtain more information, a State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN. Citing privacy concerns, ""we are unable to comment further,"" the official said. A family member of the American woman told CNN on Thursday she was informed by the FBI about the death. The family member said the FBI did not provide any details about how the woman died. CNN is not identifying the family member, who lives in Michigan, until next of kin notifications have been completed. The UK Foreign Office said it was aware of the claims, but is not able to verify them without further information. Al-Nusra Front . If the Syrian state TV report is true, it will not be the first time an American has been accused of fighting with rebel groups to overthrow al-Assad. In March, a former U.S. soldier was arrested and charged by the U.S. government with illegally using a weapon on behalf of the al-Nusra Front. Eric Harroun, 30, of Phoenix, was arrested by the FBI after returning to the United States from Syria, where authorities allege he fought with the militant group. He was charged with the alleged use of a rocket-propelled grenade. The organization he allegedly fought with, al-Nusra Front, is linked to al Qaeda in Iraq. Al-Nusra has claimed responsibility for more than 600 attacks in Syria, the Justice Department said. An FBI affidavit says Harroun crossed into Syria in January 2013 and fought against al-Assad's forces. He posted photos and videos of himself on the Internet handling RPGs and other weapons, it said. Harroun served with the U.S. Army from 2000 to 2003. Troubled talks . The report by Syrian state TV came on the same day that a leader of Syria's main rebel coalition said the group may not participate in a conference aimed at brokering an end to the civil war. ""It is difficult to continue when Syrians are constantly being hammered by the Assad regime with the help of outside forces,"" said George Sabra, acting chairman of the National Coalition, in a statement. He cited the siege of Qusayr and attacks on Eastern Gouta, a suburb of Damascus, as well as what he said was an ""invasion"" by Iranian militia members in support of al-Assad. Russia, which supports Damascus, expressed its own reservations. Conditions on the peace talks demanded by the National Coalition are too restrictive, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters, state news agency ITAR-Tass reported. ""One has the impression that the National Coalition and its regional sponsors are doing their utmost in a bid to prevent the beginning of a political process and resort to all means, including brainwashing in the West, to induce military intervention,"" Lavrov is quoted as saying. ""We regard such approaches as impermissible."" In addition, the coalition ""is not the sole representative of the Syrian people,"" Lavrov said. ""The coalition has no constructive platform."" The National Coalition has demanded that al-Assad step aside as a condition for its participation in the talks, which were originally scheduled to be held this month in Geneva, Switzerland, but have been delayed. The Syrian government has insisted that any talks be held without preconditions and has said that al-Assad will finish his term and must be qualified to run again in the 2014 elections. Fighting rages on . Some 3,000 to 4,000 Lebanese Hezbollah fighters have been deployed to Syria, where they are fighting alongside government forces, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told the Foreign Affairs Committee of France's National Assembly. The Lebanese fighters have been involved in a battle for Qusayr, a town of about 20,000 that sits astride one route to the Syrian coast and another to the Lebanese border. For the rebels, holding Qusayr represents a way of limiting the regime's ability to sustain itself. On Thursday, the media office of the Syrian Coalition in Istanbul, Turkey, said in an appeal for help that the number of wounded citizens in Qusayr had exceeded 1,000. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said the fighting was part of its mission ""to pursue terrorists in Qusayr and its countryside."" 'One axis' In an interview broadcast Thursday night by the Hezbollah television station Al-Manar, al-Assad was quoted by Lebanese media as saying, ""Syria and Hezbollah are one axis."" Hezbollah forces ""are in Lebanon and Syria, on the border area,"" al-Assad said. According to the pro-Hezbollah Al-Akhbar newspaper, he said, ""There are groups of (Hezbollah) party fighters in the border areas with Lebanon. But the Syrian army is the one fighting and running battles against the armed groups, and will continue in this battle in order to eliminate"" what he described as ""terrorists."" The president expressed skepticism that the talks proposed for Geneva would prove fruitful, the newspaper reported. Al-Assad is further quoted as saying that ""Syria received the first batch of the Russian S-300 missiles, antiaircraft systems"" and that ""the rest of the shipment will arrive soon."" ""The contracts are not related to the conflict,"" he said. ""We negotiate with them for various kinds of weapons for years. And Russia is fulfilling these contracts."" Russia has been criticized by the West for reported sales of six S-300 air defense systems to Syria under a 2010 contract. Moscow, however, has said such deliveries would conform with international law and has denied supplying Syria with weapons that can be used against civilians.

"(CNN) -- As money pours in to help the victims of Super Typhoon Haiyan, some Filipinos claim that politicians are trying to use the tragedy to win votes. Six submissions with photographs showing relief trucks and aid bearing the names of local and national politicians have cropped up on CNN iReport. Together, these reports have been viewed more than 1.5 million times since they were uploaded in the past week. While difficult to verify, the pictures show tarpaulins, bags, canisters, flip-flops and even bags of ramen noodles bearing the logos, names and photos of three politicians and the wife of one politician. Local media haven't covered this issue much, but Filipinos have a word for it: ""epal,"" Tagalog for someone butting in where not needed. It could also describe the act of politicians grandstanding for political gain during a disaster. The debate over this has ballooned online among Filipinos and the diaspora. As these images have garnered so much attention, we wanted to clarify what we know about them and what we have left to decipher. The iReport submissions have been shared widely on social media. In a matter of a week, one report had received more than 900,000 page views, and another had more than 500,000 views. The bulk of the traffic -- almost 90% -- is coming from people posting the links on Facebook, and the magnitude is unprecedented for iReport, according to CNN data. Described as one of the worst storms ever to make landfall, Super Typhoon Haiyan killed more than 5,000 people and caused catastrophic damage to many parts of the Philippines as it plowed across the country on November 8. Panoramic photo shows Haiyan devastation . Rescue and relief operations have proved daunting, with an estimated 4 million left displaced. How to help Typhoon Haiyan survivors . Patrick Fuller, a spokesman for the International Federation of the Red Cross, said he had seen some evidence that politicians were getting involved in the delivery of aid. ""I've seen vans or small pickup trucks distributing small-scale aid with a politician's face on the side,"" he said from the hard-hit city of Tacloban. ""We don't need or want to see the politicization of aid. We want the aid to go where it is needed most."" However, he added that first responders like the ones he witnessed shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. ""You've got to remember, they are bringing in relief that is needed, and that keeps people going until the more sustained effort picks up. ""It doesn't obstruct us, but we do need to ensure that relief is well-coordinated with local, regional and national authorities. We don't want to load up a truck with supplies for 1,000 families and find that someone else has come in this morning."" One of three politicians coming under fire is Philippine Vice President Jejomar Binay. Photos posted on iReport show Binay's face on a tarp on the back of a truck and the vice president's logo on blue drawstring bags of relief goods. However, Joey Salgado, a spokesman for Binay, said the photos with blue relief bags and a truck bearing the vice presidential seal were taken in 2011 and 2012, respectively. ""The photos are currently being recirculated online to make them appear they were intended for the victims of Typhoon Yolanda,"" he said Wednesday, using the storm's name in the Philippines. Salgado said the relief bags distributed by his office for Haiyan's victims were packed in plain white plastic bags, not blue ones like in the photos. The vice presidential office stopped using the tarpaulins with Binay's image more than a year ago, he said. However, a collection of photos submitted to iReport does show white plastic bags bearing Binay's name and logo. ""This is how some of the Philippine government officials will behave when there's calamity,"" a Filipino expat from Dubai named Rogel Tura wrote on CNN iReport. The Cebu, Philippines, native shared a series of photos that have circulated widely online. ""They take advantages of 'helping' by putting their names on the relief goods. It's a very strategic way in putting their name on the donations or any forms of assistance to advertise their name for the next election."" However, Salgado explained that these labeled relief bags came from a local partner in Iloilo. ""These bags were donated by a supporter of the vice president from Iloilo and did not come from the Office of the Vice President,"" he said. ""Relief goods repacked by OVP staff at the vice president's office were placed in plain white plastic bags. Relief goods from the VP's supporter were bundled with those from the OVP and were distributed in Iloilo. ""It was the initiative of our local partners to put the stickers on the bags,"" Salgado said of these photos, which were taken during Binay's visit to Iloilo on November 13. ""Since the stickers were placed without the authorization of the OVP, they were ordered removed."" Most humanitarian organizations label their aid, according to the World Food Programme. ""This is a time-honored practice in humanitarian aid to help draw recognition to those countries providing assistance,"" said Steve Taravella, senior spokesman for the WFP, based in Washington. ""In virtually every emergency, you'll see bags of rice or boxes of cooking oil marked clearly with the name of the country that provided that donation,"" he said. However, Taravella said, in his experience globally, he had not seen aid labeled with the names or photos of politicians. While the motives behind the labeled aid are unclear, the perception that politicians may be misusing the relief effort for political gain has left a bad taste in some people's mouths. ""Haiyan victims are dying and suffering for hunger. I can't just watch and do nothing,"" Tura wrote. ""This is my way of helping, telling my fellow Filipinos to wake-up and don't be lured with money and sweet promises during elections.""","Some Filipinos claim politicians are misusing the relief effort for political gain .

Extremely hot: Death Valley, California . Just more than a century ago, on July 13, 1913, the planet's hottest recorded temperature was measured in California's Death Valley -- 134 F (56.6 C). It's a high that hasn't been surpassed, but every summer we inch closer to it. In July, thermometers in Death Valley National Park -- 3.3 million acres of desiccated lake beds, barren mountains and parched canyons -- can reach beyond 125 F (51 C). What makes it so bloody hot here? Depths of 282 feet (86 meters) below sea level, combined with a narrow length and sheer mountain walls trap and maximize solar radiation. 8 Amazing American caves . This creates masses of super-heated air that have nowhere to go and nothing to do all summer long but melt the teeth of anyone foolhardy enough to visit. So who would venture into Death Valley when it gets this sweltering? ""I'd say it's a fairly select type who comes here in late June or July specifically to experience that level of heat, but we definitely do get those people -- and summer is now one of our busiest seasons,"" says Cheryl Chipman, the park's public information officer. Recently, park officials had to ask summer visitors to refrain from frying eggs on the sidewalk when it became a thing.

""Forty-below is its own badge of honor,"" says Geiger, who notes that the Arctic Circle is just 120 miles north of Fairbanks. ""Visitors love crossing that barrier too."" Extremely dark: Natural Bridges National Monument, Utah . Yes, of course, there's an International Dark-Sky Association. And, of course, it loves nights at Utah's Natural Bridges National Monument. Hiding in the preternaturally dark shadow of better known national park neighbors like Zion, Bryce and Canyonlands, Natural Bridges became the world's first IDA-certified International Dark Sky Park in 2007. That officially makes it one of the most naturally and conscientiously light pollution-free spots in the United States. According to a National Park Service survey, Natural Bridges ranks a ""Bortle Class 2"" -- the darkest sky in the study. Never mind what exactly a Bortle is (the nine-level scale measures relative observability of celestial objects), just know that Class 2 is the most pristine night sky you'll find anywhere between New York and Las Vegas.

Extremely old: St. Augustine, Florida . Unbeknown to many Americans, the oldest permanently settled European town in the United States is -- no, not Jamestown, Virginia, not Old Town, Maine, not Century City, California -- but St. Augustine, Florida. The small, tourism-fueled spot on North Florida's ""Historic Coast"" was founded in 1565 when Spanish explorer Admiral Pedro Menendez pulled ashore here and built a military base. September 2015 will mark the town's 450th birthday with fireworks, festivals and a reenactment of the Menendez landing. But in any given year there may be no better place in the United States to surrender to the forces of ""extremely old"" theme-tourism. Here one can enter the old Colonial Quarter of the country's oldest city and stroll down its oldest street, get fake diplomas at the oldest school house, hear ghost stories and enter the old jail.

"London (CNN) -- Whether or not the British parliament decides to subject the proposed takeover of UK-based AstraZeneca by American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to a public interest test, it's clear we have already seen much more political intervention than is typically involved in an acquisition of one company by another. The chief executives of both companies are being hauled in front of not one, but two parliamentary committees this week to give evidence about the possible implications of a deal, when an offer hasn't even been accepted yet. Pfizer's pursuit of AstraZeneca has stirred up a wealth of protectionist feeling in Britain, despite the fact the company was originally created from a merger with Sweden's Astra and has the bulk of its employees outside of the UK. The reaction to Pfizer's bid raises the question of what nationality really means for modern multinationals. Over 50% of shares on the UK stock market are owned by investors from the rest of the world and many of the companies have employees and customers on several continents. They make their investment decisions based on a range of commercial and reputational factors, with nationalism way down the list. When companies choose to locate their operations in the UK, they do so because it is an attractive place to do business.  The UK accounts for 10% of world's pharmaceutical research and development spending and AstraZeneca says it supports more than 33,000 jobs. Companies have chosen to conduct their R&D here in part because of the strength of Britain's universities and a positive tax system, including the ""patent box"" which incentivizes businesses to invest in research. Government has a significant role to play in promoting life sciences, and creating a stable tax and regulatory regime, but ultimately it will always be up to companies to make those investment decisions. Many have argued that the government should be doing all it can to protect these R&D jobs, but that displays a degree of wishful thinking about the state's ability to pick winners. British politicians have a poor record in this area, as shown notably with British Leyland in the 1970s and 80s. Some have argued that, while not intervening in the running of companies, the government should require firmer commitments to retain research facilities and employees. The memory of the Kraft takeover over Cadbury, which saw significant lay-offs soon after the takeover, is fresh in the memory. The Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Chuka Umunna, is right to argue that there are no assurances that a company could give that they would be able to preserve jobs forever after a takeover, but it doesn't follow that we should demand ever more promises. The merged company, large as it would be, would still be subject to commercial pressures, and forced to adapt as necessary to an ever-changing world. The very impossibility of cast-iron guarantees should convince us that politician intervention is at best futile, and at worst risks undermining the UK as a destination for investment. This may have been an unusually large reaction, but foreign companies looking at Britain may be entitled to think that being the subject of a parliamentary debate and receiving a grilling from two select committees are not the hallmarks of an economy which allows firms to conduct their lawful business as they think best. None of this, of course, is an argument in favor of the takeover. There may even be good reasons to think that the tax benefits for Pfizer give the whole thing a fishy smell. But the people to decide this are the board and the shareholders. This isn't about making a quick buck from the sale. Under the UK Corporate Governance Code, the company's directors are explicitly required to deliver success over the long-term. The board of AstraZeneca must consider a range of stakeholders, including employees and the scientific community. If it continues to feel that it has a stronger future as an independent company, as it did when it rejected the recent bid, then the board should continue to advise shareholders to ignore Pfizer's advances. Ultimately, the decision is in the hands of shareholders. They must consider carefully whether even an increased offer should make them sell up -- after all, any deal would involve part payment in shares of the combined company, not something you want to hold if you think it's a bad deal.

"(CNN) -- A missing British yacht was found overturned with its keel broken, causing a breech in the hull, about 1,000 miles off Massachusetts, but the four-man crew is still missing, the U.S. Coast Guard said Friday. A U.S. Navy helicopter spotted the capsized the 39-foot Cheeki Rafiki sailboat within a Coast Guard search area east of Cape Cod, officials said. A Navy boat crew and surface swimmer assessed the damaged boat, but the swimmer found no signs of the crew after knocking on the hull and reaching below the waterline, the Coast Guard said. Search crews looked Friday for a bright-colored life raft and the missing sailors, who the Royal Yachting Association identified as skipper Andrew Bridge, 21; Steve Warren, 52; Paul Goslin, 56; and James Male, 23. As expected, the Coast Guard suspended the search at 10 p.m. ET Friday -- which was midnight in the search zone -- after scouring another 21,000 square miles. No sailors had been found as of then. In a statement Friday night, the Coast Guard hinted that the prospects anyone would be found alive are slim. ""Based on the extreme sea conditions at the time of distress, but assuming best-case emergency equipment, the estimated survival time past the time of distress was approximately 20 hours,"" the Coast Guard said. ""Searches were suspended nearly 200 hours after the time of distress."" The four British sailors have been missing in the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week. The 39-foot (12 meters) Cheeki Rafiki was sailing from the Caribbean to the United Kingdom on May 15 when it began taking on water, according to Doug Innes, the yacht's managing agent. Innes said contact was lost with the boat -- which he describes as ""a performance racer/cruiser"" that is ""equipped for trans-Atlantic sailing and racing"" -- early the next morning. He added that he believed the crew abandoned to the life raft. But the U.S. Coast Guard appeared to dispel that notion, saying Friday night that ""the boat's life raft was secured in its storage space ... indicating the crew had not been able to use it for emergency purposes.""

"(CNN) -- Paul Bailey shares his London home with two strangers, Alejandro and Fernando. More than a million people in the British capital now live in flatshares. And while this kind of living arrangement used to be associated with students and youthful television sitcoms, more and more mature people find themselves living with strangers. Like Bailey, who is 43. ""What we are seeing now more than ever is an increase in the amount of people over 40 looking for flatshares,"" Matt Hutchkinson from flatmate-finding service Spareroom said. ""At the moment, one in eight people in flatshares is over 40 and that's a real shift from three to . four years ago,"" he says. Bailey was forced to find flatmates after separating from his partner of 15 years. ""It was a fleeting thought that 'oh my god' I'm going to have to do it again. I'm 43 years old,"" he said. ""The last time I lived with someone was in my 20s -- how is this going to work?"" With rents in London reaching the double of the national average, sharing is often the only option. UK Census figures show that 15% of people living in London share their homes with people they are not related to. In the U.S., the numbers are also rising. The number of shared households involving flatmates who are neither related to each other nor a couple grew by one fifth in the decade between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. census. In New York City alone, the number of flats shared by strangers reached 200,000 in 2011. Websites helping people find their ideal flatmates, such as Spareroom, Flatshare and Roombuddies are booming. Spareroom says it saw a 20% increase in the number of people looking for roommates in January compared to last year. In New York City, 2,500 room offers in shared properties were posted on advertising site Craigslist in the first four days of April. As for Paul Bailey, he seems to be happy with his new living arrangements. ""It's been three, four months and it's been brilliant. I come home and see the little light on and go 'yay', I've got someone at home, I have someone to talk to,"" he said.","15% of people living in London share their homes with people they are not related to .

"(CNN) -- In this year's season of commencement speeches, these academic rites of passage have become the subject of fierce political controversy. Just over the past few months, several prominent invited speakers, including Condoleezza Rice, Christine Lagarde, and Robert Birgeneau have withdrawn following a campus backlash to news they would be coming to Rutgers, Smith, and Haverford, respectively. This trend is not entirely new, since college students have been protesting proposed speakers for many decades. But there is some indication that in the age of social networking and the Internet, where news spreads around campus and across state lines quickly, the controversies will continue to intensify. Regardless of what one thinks of the politics of any of the speakers at the center of this year's debates, these and other incidents could have the unfortunate impact of producing future invitations only to those who will not be controversial or say anything bold. Rather than big ideas or stimulating thought as a result of commencement exercises, we could head down a road where parents and students congregate to hear a few jokes and milquetoast comments before heading home with their degrees. This would be a loss. In fact, sometimes commencement speeches have been the venue to introduce bold ideas to the American public. Fifty years ago, toward the end of May 1964, President Lyndon Johnson -- just six months after becoming president following the assassination of JFK -- stepped up to the podium at the University of Michigan. On a bright sunny day, Johnson spoke to about 85,000 people who were packed into Michigan stadium, celebrating the class of '64, to introduce them to the idea of a Great Society, an idea that would guide a transformation in public policy that lives on today. The speech had been a long time in the making. For months Johnson had been struggling to come up with a concept that would describe his legislative agenda. Richard Goodwin, who had worked as a special counsel to the House Legislative Oversight Committee that had investigated the quiz show scandal in 1959 and who had worked as a speechwriter for President Kennedy, was given the task of solving Johnson's problem. Goodwin had kept a close eye on the growing ferment on the college campuses in the early 1960s, including the establishment of the left-wing Students for a Democratic Society which was committed to achieving civil rights and participatory democracy. Goodwin met with the best experts he knew to come up with a phrase that summed up Johnson's program. Princeton historian Eric Goldman, whom Johnson had recruited as an adviser, said that Johnson should focus public attention on issues other than economic growth. He mentioned the title of a book by the journalist Walter Lippmann, called ""The Good Society."" Goodwin shared the concept with adviser Bill Moyers who then used it in a number of smaller speeches for LBJ leading up to the graduation. On May 22, 1964, Johnson delivered his 20 minute commencement address, which was only finished the night before, to the exuberant students at Michigan. The speech was a smash hit. The students interrupted Johnson several times to applaud. Johnson told the students that the nation had the possibility of reaching beyond merely being a ""rich"" and ""powerful"" society to becoming a ""Great Society"" that delivered something more. He said: ""The Great Society rests on abundance and liberty for all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. ... It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce, but the desire for beauty and the hunger of community."" ""Will you join in the battle to give every citizen the full equality which God enjoins and the law requires, whatever his belief, or race, or the color of his skin? Will you join the battle,"" Johnson asked, ""to give every citizen an escape from the crushing weight of poverty?"" Richard Goodwin, who watched the speech from the White House, felt as ""if I were hearing the words for the first time, experiencing the exhilarating revelation of suddenly widening horizons. ... I clapped for the president, and for our country."" Johnson was exhilarated by the response. On Air Force One, he walked to the back of the plane to recap the key points with reporters so that they did not miss them for their stories. The speech provided powerful motivation to legislators and activists who struggled over the next few years to pass legislation that enhanced the power of the federal government to provide support for education, medical care, voting rights, environmental programs, housing support and more. Today, liberals can certainly look back at the speech for inspiration, finding a powerful set of arguments to use to justify government intervention through programs such as the minimum wage, health care, and green jobs. Johnson's vision in the speech was that the government could help make the quality of life better for all Americans and provide the tools that every citizen needed to become self-sufficient and independent actors. Some of the programs didn't turn out as well as he hoped. But others, such as Medicare for the aged and voting rights for African-Americans, proved to be stunning successes. The ideas that Johnson proposed were certainly controversial. At the time a powerful bloc of Southern conservative Democrats and Republicans controlled Congress and had little appetite for growing government. Republicans were about to nominate Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater as their nominee for the 1964 election, indicating that the right-wing was a growing presence in national politics. For every organization like the Students for Democratic Action there was another, like the conservative Young Americans for Freedom that saw the future through a much different lens. Commencement talks can be more than about celebrity, funny quips, and attention-gaining opportunities for colleges. They can be moments that truly inspire and change the national conversation. A little over 50 years ago, Lyndon Johnson was able to accomplish that in Ann Arbor.","Controversy led three speakers to drop out of commencement talks this year .

"(CNN) -- Seriously, is there anything Seth MacFarlane doesn't do? Writer, actor, director, singer, producer, voice of beloved animated characters and awards show host. The world is about to see if leading man is yet another title MacFarlane can add to his already extensive Hollywood resume. MacFarlane's film ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" opens this weekend, and it is first time he's heading up a cast as a real live actor. The film spoofs old-fashioned Westerns. MacFarlane plays Albert Stark, a sheep farmer who is far from enthused about living in the West. Of course, it's not his first movie. MacFarlane wrote and directed the 2012 film ""Ted"" as well as voiced the foul-mouthed, stuffed bear around which the plot revolves. But this is the first time MacFarlane himself has stepped into the spotlight, which begs an obvious question. ""Does 'A Million Ways to Die in the West' certify Mr. MacFarlane as a bona fide movie star,"" asks The New York Times' Stephen Holden. ""It's too soon to tell. He demonstrates enough confidence to emerge relatively unscathed from the movie, which he produced, directed and wrote (with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild), but he is far from imperial. At the same time, you wonder if someone else (maybe Jim Carrey) could have given Albert a stronger personality."" MacFarlane's career began at a fairly young age. He told Bill Maher during a CNN interview that he began drawing as a toddler. ""I would watch 'Woody Woodpecker' and Fred Flintstone and whatnot, and I would -- my parents saved sketches that I did that are crude but oddly recognizable,"" MacFarlane said. It was while he was a student at the Rhode Island School of Design that he began developing what would ultimately become the hit Fox animated series ""Family Guy."" He went on to develop more animated shows: ""American Dad!"" and ""The Cleveland Show."" MacFarlane told Rolling Stone in 2012 that he believed ""Family Guy"" was often unfairly dismissed as ""frat boy humor,"" though he admitted that there is plenty of that. ""But we try to include an equal amount of intelligent humor,"" he told the magazine. ""If it makes you laugh, what's wrong with that? There's room for both highbrow and lowbrow."" The success of his critically acclaimed 2011 jazz album, ""Music Is Better Than Words"" (it was nominated for two Grammys) has led to a deal for a reported forthcoming Christmas album. And he is one of the producers of the rebooted ""Cosmos: A Space Time Odyssey"" television series. That's not to say that everything MacFarlane has touched has been golden. His live-action Fox comedy ""Dads"" starring another Seth (Green) and Giovanni Ribisi was panned by critics from the onset and was recently canceled. And his stint as the host of the 2013 Academy Awards telecast left viewers divided. His ""Million Ways to Die in the West"" co-star Charlize Theron praised his versatility. ""He's fantastic,"" she said. ""He wears every single hat which was about 150 that he wore in this move really well like just a seasoned pro. I mean there was nothing about him that said to me he was a first-time actor or a -- I think we were all very impressed by just how effortlessly he did all of it."" As for MacFarlane, he said he had a very simple reason for stepping in front of the camera. ""I like a challenge,"" he said. ""I like taking a risk, something I haven't done before.""","Seth MacFarlane has a long, diverse resume .

Miami police said they were trying to determine what led to the shooting, which was reported to authorities about 2:15 a.m., CNN affiliate WSVN reported.

"(CNN) -- The fat lady finally sang when the New York City Opera filed for bankruptcy on Thursday after the company fell short of an emergency fund-raising goal of $7 million. The company's projected deficit was $44.1 million for the 2012 fiscal year, according to the Chapter 11 petition filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. The New York City Ballet was listed as one of its largest unsecured creditors at an estimated $1.6 million, the filing showed. The opera blamed a ""troubled economy, decreased donations, and increasing pension obligations"" for its financial troubles, the petition said. Unless another cultural or educational institution is willing to partner with the opera, or there is a ""miraculous increase in donations,"" the company will be forced to use the Chapter 11 process to liquidate, the affidavit said. The opera company also needed to raise an additional $13 million by the end of 2013 for future seasons, it said in a news release. The company had hoped to raise $1 million of the $7 million through an online site, Kickstarter.com, in a campaign that ended Monday. It raised only $301,019 from more than 2,000 donors. The organization raised $1.5 million outside of the Kickstarter campaign, according to the company's spokeswoman Risa Heller. ""The odds have been against us for a long time, but in the face of that difficulty we have made tremendous progress,"" George Steel, general manager and artistic director for the company, said in a video for the failed online campaign. The company, dubbed ""The People's Opera"" by former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, was founded on the principle that every New Yorker should be able to afford to go to the opera, Steel said. He explained that in order for the company to break even, it would have needed to sell every ticket for $600. Instead, the starting ticket price was set at $25 to make the experience affordable. The New York City Opera received critical praise for its world premieres of works including Robert Ward's ""The Crucible"" and Anthony Davis' ""The Life and Times of Malcolm X."" It opened its current season on September 17 with the opera ""Anna Nicole,"" which turned out to be the company's last production. ""We need the help of the people we were founded to serve to put on our season this year,"" Steel had said, speaking to New York residents and opera fans everywhere. ""We need you to come together and carry it forward into the future. I hope we can count on you."" In a statement from the American Federation of Musicians, President Tino Gagliardi said that despite the musicians making great sacrifices in wages and benefits to keep the opera afloat, they long feared this would happen. ""NYCO management's reckless decisions to move the New York City Opera out of its newly renovated home at Lincoln Center ... predictably resulted in financial disaster for the company,"" Gagliardi said. The opera company left Lincoln Center in 2011 in an effort to save money. Since then it had staged performances at various venues. This year marked the 70th anniversary of the New York City Opera, which opened in 1943 as the second opera house in the city. The Metropolitan Opera was founded in 1880.","The New York City Opera filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy Thursday .

"(CNN) -- New York police are searching for a man who stabbed two children, one fatally, in an elevator Sunday evening. Police described the man as a ""heavy set"" black male, approximately 6 feet tall, between ages 25 and 35, and last seen wearing a gray shirt. He stabbed a 6-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl inside an elevator in their apartment building in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn and fled, police said. Prince Joshua ""PJ"" Avitto, 6, was stabbed in the torso and transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The girl was also stabbed in the torso and remains in critical condition, according to police. New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Monday that the two children were on their way to get ice cream when they were stabbed. ""The amount of violence we saw in an unusual weekend reinforces the need for an energized police department,"" Bratton said. ""We cannot have a city where two ... children going to get an ice cream are stabbed, one killed and the other fighting for her life. That is not the City of New York that we want to police."" Families of both children have been coping with grief and have struggled to comprehend the situation. ""It's two children. It doesn't make any sense,"" said Scott Avitto, PJ's uncle. ""We're all just struggling, we're trying to pull it together. Our family is strong, but we just want justice to be done."" ""Pray for her, and us. And pray for PJ's family. This is senseless. I don't know what monster would do something like this,"" Regenia Trevathan, the girl's great-grandmother, told CNN affiliate WCBS. She said adults were watching the children outside on a playground when they went inside the building alone to get ice cream. Avitto was related to Taj Gibson, a forward for the Chicago Bulls. Gibson tweeted Monday morning: ""They killed my lil super man. #rippj only two more weeks until your 7 birthday. Tears forever."" Gibson also posted a picture of Avitto to his Instagram account. PJ's godfather Henry Alston said the boy's funeral will be Friday. Police have recovered a Dura Edge knife that was used in the homicide. Investigators are considering the possibility that the suspect may also be responsible for another fatal stabbing that occurred just blocks away. Tanaya Copeland, 18, was found in the same neighborhood Friday night, unconscious and unresponsive with multiple stab wounds to her torso. Copeland was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, police said. The close proximity of the incidents, as well as similarities in the type of weapons used, have led detectives to believe the two cases may be related. No arrests have yet been made in either case, and the investigation is ongoing, police said. 12-year-old girls accused of stabbing friend .

"(CNN) -- World War I slaughtered and mutilated soldiers on a scale the world had never seen. It's little wonder that its vast numbers of returning crippled veterans led to major gains in the technology of prosthetic limbs. Virtually every device produced today to replace lost body function of soldiers returning from our modern wars -- as well as accident victims, or victims of criminal acts, such as the Boston Marathon bombings -- has its roots in the technological advances that emerged from World War I. The war, which began nearly 100 years ago, produced its own crop of bionic men. In previous wars, severely injured soldiers often succumbed to gangrene and infection. Thanks to better surgery, many now survived. On the German side alone, there were 2 million casualties, 64 percent of them with injured limbs. Some 67,000 were amputees. Over 4,000 amputations were performed on U.S. service personnel according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. How a century-old war affects you . In all nations involved in the war an emerging generation of so-called ""war cripples,"" as they were referred to in Germany, loomed ominously over the pension and welfare system, and many government bureaucrats, military leaders and civilians worried about their long-term fate. One solution was returning mutilated soldiers to the workforce. Various prostheses were designed to make that possible, pushing prosthesis manufacturing in many countries from a cottage industry towards modern mass production. In the United States the Artificial Limb Laboratory was established in 1917 at the Walter Reed General Hospital, in conjunction with the Army Medical School, with the goal to give every amputee soldier a ""modern limb,"" enabling them to pass as able-bodied citizens in the workplace. While the United States remained the largest producer of artificial limbs worldwide, Germany's prosthetic developments incorporated a particular quest for efficiency. German orthopedists, engineers and scientists invented more than 300 new kinds of arms and legs and other prosthetic devices to help. Artificial legs made of wood or metal, sometimes relatively rudimentary, and often recreating the knee-joint in some way, enabled leg-amputees to stand and move around unaided. Glass eyes and a variety of facial prostheses allowed those with defacing injuries to appear in public. For example, a galvanized and painted copper plate could fill in the missing eye socket and neighboring maxillary bone. A lost arm or hand was particularly difficult to replace. In the United States engineers had designed a mechanical arm for that purpose that came into wide use after the war. The so-called Carnes arm was not optimal for mechanical work, but it imitated the natural limb and was relatively easy to mass produce cheaply. It became a huge business success. How World War I gave us 'cooties' In Berlin, the Test Center for Replacement Limbs evaluated prosthetic technologies, such as the Carnes arm. Positioned at the confluence of medicine, engineering and the new science of ergonomics, the test center offers a particularly striking example of the setting that made modern prosthetics possible. The center's head, the engineer and professor Georg Schlesinger, was an adherent of Frederick Taylor's ""scientific management"" -- an approach that applied scientific methods to optimize work flows and labor productivity. His idea of a proper prosthesis was something functional and efficient, an exchangeable and mass producible replacement device that would fit with the human body. While earlier prostheses often tried to replicate body appearance, or to follow the inner structural plan of the original appendage -- its shape, muscles, sinews-- Schlesinger saw no need to do that. He reasoned that airplanes could fly without imitating birds' wings, so why did prosthetics have to mimic arms and legs? The Siemens-Schuckert-Works Universal Arm, invented in 1916, was a remarkable example of functional efficiency. It was basically a tool-holder with interchangeable parts. Its ""hands"" ranged from a simple hammer to cutlery with elongated handles to inserts whose ends could be attached to machines. It could serve the carpenter, farmer, draughtsman, locksmith, lathe-turner, cabinet-maker or tinsmith. Many of these prostheses literally merged man and machine, leaving the disabled man firmly attached to his work station. An amputee veteran would arrive at his work place in the factory, hook up the remaining part of his limb to the prosthesis, which in turn would be linked to one of the industrial machines in the factory. He would work for hours like this as a link in a functional kinetic chain. The image of men tied to their work resonates unsettlingly with Karl Marx's prediction that the urban proletariat would one day become a mere ""appendage of the machine."" It's an example of how military and industrial conceptions of the body were extended to dehumanize the body itself. Some visionaries, of course, embraced prosthetics as a means for human transformation, as if the body were a malleable object that could be dignified and enhanced by technology. And some thinkers go even further and interpret technological enhancement as a next step in human evolution. Reality might not be so far behind: In 2008 runner Oscar Pistorius, a double-leg amputee, sought to compete in the Bejing Olympics, but his running blades, made of carbon fiber and modeled after a cheetah's leg, were seen by some as an unfair advantage. Four years later in London, he did compete in the Olympics, embodying a development that had its origins 100 years earlier, in World War I.","Thomas Schlich: The mutilation of soldiers in WWI led to revolution in prosthetic limbs .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's one of the busiest days in this year's primary calendar. Six states from coast to coast hold primaries on Tuesday, and again anti-establishment candidates face long odds in high-profile Republican showdowns. Since its birth in 2009, the tea party has had a number of primary successes, with victorious challenges from the right producing major headlines for the movement. But they've also given the party plenty of headaches and hurt its chances of winning back the Senate, effectively costing the GOP five winnable elections over the last two cycles. This year, the establishment learned to fight back, and so far has had the upper hand in most contests against tea party-backed challengers. Here are five key showdowns to watch how they play out on Tuesday. 1. Big showdown in the Bluegrass State: Tuesday's marquee battle is in Kentucky, where Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell is challenged by businessman Matt Bevin, who enjoys strong support from many tea party groups and influential conservative anti-establishment organizations. While this race has seen big spending by the campaigns and outside groups, McConnell is expected to cruise to renomination for a sixth term. Anti-establishment Republicans feel McConnell represents everything wrong in Washington and thought he could be knocked off. The Senate Conservatives fund, a D.C.-based anti-establishment organization, spent around $1 million in support of Bevin and against McConnell. But it's been quiet recently, with McConnell's formidable lead in the polls. McConnell had two Kentucky-based super PACs supporting him as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association. ""It was a vintage Mitch McConnell campaign. They found Bevin's weaknesses and used them against him. They boxed him in and he couldn't move,"" said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the non-partisan Cook Political Report, a top campaign handicapper. She added that ""Bevin suffered from new candidate syndrome."" McConnell's ending his primary campaign by once again touting his endorsement from Kentucky's other Republican senator, Rand Paul. Paul was the upstart who beat McConnell's pick in the race. But Paul, who is very influential among tea party activists and libertarians, backed McConnell last year before Bevin got into the race. The narrator in one of McConnell's two closing statewide TV commercials says, ""On Tuesday, join with Rand Paul and vote for Mitch McConnell."" And the spot includes a clip of Paul saying last year that Kentucky ""ought to be proud of having Senator McConnell."" While McConnell should have an early night on Tuesday, he faces a serious challenge in November from rising Democratic star Alison Lundergan Grimes. Big-name Democrats are already campaigning for her. 2. Idaho -- the other big event: The other high-profile, outsider vs. establishment battle of the night is in the House. Eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson faces a serious primary challenge from Bryan Smith, an attorney who claims that Simpson's not conservative enough and is soft on spending. Smith is backed by some tea party groups and by the D.C.-based anti-tax group Club for Growth, which has a history of backing conservative primary challengers. The group has spent some $700,000 to attack Simpson and support Smith. But their spending dwindled the past couple of weeks, as Simpson has held a sizable lead in recent polls. Simpson is backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has spent heavily in the race. ""You can take it from me, the conservative choice for Congress is Mike Simpson,"" Mitt Romney says in one ad put out by the Chamber last month. Simpson, was an early backer of the Republican 2012 presidential nominee's campaign. And Romney returned the favor last year, endorsing Simpson. The winner of the primary will be the odds-on-favorite in November in the heavily Republican district, which covers the central and eastern parts of the state, from Boise to the borders with Utah and Wyoming. 3. Georgia -- tea party splits vote: Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss' announcement last year that he wouldn't run for re-election triggered a free-for-all GOP primary battle. Reps. Phil Gingrey, Paul Broun and Jack Kingston, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, and businessman David Perdue are the major candidates and Kingston, Handel, and Perdue, rather than the more conservative Broun and Gingrey, are on top of public opinion polls. ""I think they (Broun and Gingrey) both ran terrible campaigns,"" said the Cook Report's Duffy. ""Because both of them were in there, the tea party movement was divided."" The primary campaign's closing days have seen near daily attacks between the candidates. An example of how ugly it's getting on the campaign trail: Gingrey's campaign sent out an email accusing Handel of ""promoting teenage homosexuality,"" highlighting a vote she took in favor of funding for an LGBT youth program when she served on the Fulton County Commission. Since no candidate's expected to top 50%, this contest's all-but-certain to head to a July 22 runoff between the top two finishers. The eventual GOP nominee will face off against Michelle Nunn, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee and daughter of former longtime Sen. Sam Nunn, a household name in Georgia. 4. Oregon -- a last-minute wildcard?: The race for the GOP Senate nomination in Oregon, a vote-by-mail state, has only recently grabbed some national attention, mostly due to some high-profile support for Portland pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Monica Wehby. She recently won endorsements from Romney and another 2012 GOP presidential candidate: former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who's a co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" More importantly, D.C.-based NewRepublican.org went up with major television, digital and radio spots in support of Wehby. The organization was formed early last year, following the 2012 GOP election defeats, by a group of Republican veterans to refocus its messaging and policy goals in an attempt to broaden the GOP's appeal beyond its traditional base. Wehby, who also enjoys the backing of several GOP senators including McConnell, grabbed some attention last month for a campaign ad of her own. The 60-second spot highlighted a woman who was advised to consider terminating her pregnancy because her unborn daughter had spinal problems. In the ad, the woman recalls how Wehby operated on her daughter shortly after she was born, and that the girl is now a healthy 12-year-old. But Wehby's support for abortion rights has fueled a six-figure spending push by anti-abortion groups in opposing Wehby. Polls show Wehby ahead of more conservative state Rep. Jason Conger, who was backed last week by former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a Republican presidential candidate last time who may run again for the White House in 2016. The wildcard: A last-minute story over the weekend revealed that after a breakup last year with the wealthy man she was dating, Wehby was accused of ""stalking"" him, according to a police report.

Pennsylvania -- a race to the left: Republicans can't have all the fun. The Democratic gubernatorial primary contest in the Keystone State has been one long wild ride. In this race to the left, Rep. Allyson Schwartz has been touting her strong support for the health care law, better known as Obamacare, a rare sight this midterm election year, as she plays catchup with businessman Tom Wolf, who leads in the polls. Wolf was virtually unknown in Pennsylvania at the start of the year, but he spent big bucks to flood the airwaves with ads. Wolf has increasingly come under attack from Schwartz as well as state Treasurer Rob McCord, another contender in the field. The winner will face off in November against GOP Gov. Tom Corbett, who seems to be enjoying the food fight among the Democratic challengers. ""The Democrat fight for governor is getting ugly,"" says the narrator in a new Corbett TV ad that uses a boxing theme. But Corbett has his own concerns, as he's considered one of the most vulnerable governors running for re-election this year.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell faces tea party challenge .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese state media frequently treats Japan's atrocities of the past like breaking news of today. But lately, the steady flow of war history-related news has become a flood. Amid fast-deteriorating Sino-Japanese relations, China's State Archives Administration recently re-opened case files from a Chinese military tribunal in 1956 and launched a dedicated website to publish summaries of confessions by 45 convicted Japanese war criminals. Among the horrifying accounts posted online by Chinese authorities are confessions of raping countless women, burying people alive and performing human vivisections in China -- all handwritten by captured Japanese army officers after World War II and long sealed in the state archives in Beijing. The Chinese government's target is clear. ""Since the Abe cabinet came into power in Japan,"" begins the online introduction to the confessions, referring to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""It has openly confused right and wrong to mislead the public, in an attempt to whitewash the history of external aggression and colonialism."" Tense seas . China and Japan have a dark history of conflict, including the nine-year Second Sino-Japanese War during which the contentious Nanjing Massacre took place from December 13, 1937 to March 1, 1938. Japanese soldiers committed mass murders and forced Chinese and Korean women into sexual slavery during the occupation of Nanjing. But it was a more recent flare-up, say analysts, which brought the historic grievances back out into the open. Relations between China and Japan became strained in 2012 when Japan claimed islands in the East China Sea. China then declared in November 2013 an Air Defense Identification Zone over the East China Sea, imposing air traffic restrictions over the disputed area. China's moves have made Japan and other nations in South East Asia nervous over it's expanding military and more assertive foreign policy, accusing China of trying to change the status quo. A right turn . In December, Abe further stoked tensions by visiting the Yasukuni Shrine where Japanese soldiers are honored -- including wartime leaders convicted as class-A war criminals. Abe became the first sitting prime minister to make the provocative visit since Junichiro Koizumi went in 2006. Six months later, Abe declared a more liberal interpretation of Japan's post-war pacifist constitution, essentially lifting a decades-long ban that prevented its military from fighting abroad. The following month, China released the Japanese wartime confessions online. Beijing also marked the anniversary of the Second Sino-Japanese War with an elaborate commemoration ceremony at Lugou Bridge, the site of the first showdown. ""China is responding to Prime Minister Abe's attempts to rehabilitate the discredited wartime past. It's trying to underscore the fact that Japan suffers from selective amnesia,"" says Jeff Kingston, an expert in Asian regional tensions and a professor at Temple University, Japan Campus. Global strategy . For long-time China watchers, this back-and-forth may be escalating at an alarming rate, but it is nothing new. ""Since the early 1990s, the communist party has been trying to stoke anti-Japanese patriotism among the Chinese people mostly because they wanted to regain some of the legitimacy they lost in the Tiananmen Square massacre,"" says Kingston, referring to the bloody military crackdown on Chinese student demonstrators in 1989. For China's president, the nationalism stoked by anti-Japanese sentiment, could become a powerful tool. ""Nationalism is a very potent force in China right now. Xi is strengthening nationalistic sentiment to unify the country behind him and reinforce his own position as leader,"" says Frank Ching, a political commentator. Beyond fomenting patriotism at home, China is also reminding its international partners that Japan hasn't come clean about its past. Kingston explains that Japan's imperialist history ""is Abe's Achilles' heel."" By highlighting Abe's right-wing inclinations, China can drive a wedge between the U.S. and Japan, while pulling South Korea -- another nation that suffers wartime scars inflicted by Japan -- closer. China appears to be using it's propaganda push to isolate Japan from its allies. Resolution . But China's heavy-handed propaganda may backfire in the end because foreign governments may see it in a more cynical light. ""If they press their case more quietly, it would be more effective,"" says Kingston. It may also lead the nations further away from resolution. ""These battles over history undermine trust and limit the room for diplomacy. It's very difficult for both sides to find a face-saving way to climb down,"" says Kingston. Abe has repeatedly called for face-to-face talks with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping. ""The door for dialogue is always open on my side, and I hope China has the same attitude,"" the Japanese leader said. But analysts are not hopeful for talks, as both nations wait for the other to make the first move. ""The Chinese side has made it clear that they will not talk to Abe unless he takes action to show that his attitude has changed, but I don't see Abe doing that in the absence of any commitment from China for a meeting first,"" says Ching. All eyes are now on the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit coming up in November during which Abe has invited Xi to a meeting on the sidelines. The two leaders have never met since both came to power in 2012.","Sino-Japanese relations fast deteriorating amid tensions over disputed islands in the East China Sea .

"(CNN) -- Wednesday's decision by the U.S. Patent Office to repeal six federal trademarks of the Washington Redskins on the grounds that the name is ""disparaging to Native Americans"" is, of course, a victory for the Native American community and our allies. Yet we have been here before. In 1999, Suzan Shown Harjo, who is Cheyenne and Hodulgee Muscogee, won a battle against the Washington Redskins after a three-judge panel of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ruled against the team and removed its trademark protections. But that decision was later appealed and the ruling overturned, and the team regained its trademarks. That is why today's decision is certainly worth celebrating, but not without a sense of hesitation. Should team owner Dan Snyder's appeal to the U.S. Patent Office fail, then we can celebrate even louder -- and even louder when the name is changed. Still, Snyder's trademark attorney Bob Raskopf is adamant that the team will, again, emerge victorious and win its appeal. ""We've seen this before,"" Raskopf said in a press release on Wednesday. ""And just like last time, today's ruling will have no effect at all on the team's ownership of and right to use the Redskins name and logo."" But what Raskopf hasn't seen before is a proliferation of voices opposing the team name. Members of Congress, local D.C. officials, celebrities, media commentators and even former Washington Redskins like cornerback Champ Bailey have spoken out against the team name and urged Snyder to relent and change the name. Bailey even likened the team name to the n-word. ""When you hear a Native American say that 'Redskins' is degrading, it's almost like the N-word for a black person,"" Bailey told USA Today Sports. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, speaking on the capitol floor in response to the trademark repeal, said, ""This is extremely important to Native Americans all over the country that they no longer use this name. It's racist. The writing is on the wall."" The Washington team and the NFL, of course, realize the cancellation of the trademark protection hits them where it hurts -- their pocketbook, which was the whole point of the case brought by Amanda Blackhorse, a Navajo, who was one of five plaintiffs to contest the team's federal trademark protection. If the team won't change the name voluntarily then it will be changed by force, not unlike how the team was forced to integrate black football players in the 1960s. Now, without trademark protection, anyone can make and sell Washington Redskins shirts, jerseys, hats and all manner of schwag without the legal muscle to hinder imitation Redskins products. Yet this issue is bigger than the Washington Redskins. It's bigger than the slur alone. This is a campaign of dignity and humanity. The Washington team may be threatened by the very real possibility that it will have to change its name in the near future, but that doesn't let the Cleveland Indians off the hook, or the Atlanta Braves, for that matter. But they're feeling the pressure, too. Native Americans also are working to remove the Cleveland Indian logo of Chief Wahoo. This movement is about the dehumanization of Native Americans on every level -- not just in sports, but in media and Hollywood, as well. This is about respect and about the mental stability of our children. Empirical study has proven that Indian mascots harm the mental health of Native American children. They report to have low self-esteem, a limited sense of social worth and do not believe they can accomplish as much as students from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. These scientific studies do routinely fall on deaf ears, and somehow people, even prominent ones, continue to fight for the privilege to use the racial slur. Al Michaels, the NBC Sunday Night Football sportscaster, recently defended the use of the name and called the controversy ""nuts."" ""I mean, for 70-some odd years this was a zero issue, and then it became an issue,"" he said. But that's not quite accurate. Harjo and even the late American Indian Movement leader Russell Means fought against the name as well as all manner of Indian mascotry for decades. But with the continuing ubiquity of the Web and social media, the Native American voice has amplified. Just because someone couldn't hear our elders in the 1960s and 1970s raging against the name doesn't mean they weren't responding to this form of racism as well as fighting for our rights as indigenous peoples. I was asked recently why the mascot issue matters more than the epidemic of poverty on reservations. Or why we are bothered more by a word than the high school dropout rate of Native American students, which is the highest in the country. It's not that names matter more, it's that when we talk about death rates, rape and epidemics in Indian country we don't always get a response. But when we interrupt sports? We always get a response. Blackhorse, the plaintiff in the previous case, Blackhorse et al v. Pro-Football Inc., told USA Today what she would say to Washington owner Daniel Snyder. ""I'd ask him, 'Would you dare call me a redskin, right here, to my face?' "" she says. ""And I suspect that, no, he would not do that.""","Simon Moya-Smith wonders if the latest trademark ruling could be the beginning of the end .

"Cairo (CNN) -- To say that Elhamy Elzayat misses the glory days when huge numbers of visitors flocked to Egypt's ancient sites is probably an understatement. A veteran of the travel industry who now heads the Egyptian Tourism Federation, he's seen his business take hit after hit as the country's stability unraveled in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring. ""I have six cruise ships,"" he laments. ""They are not operating for three years now."" Better times could soon be around the corner. Elections this month to choose a new president are seen by many as an opportunity to draw a line under months of turmoil and return to stability. The vote is likely, however, to raise fresh concerns over visitor safety and ongoing outbreaks of sometimes deadly violence. Yet Elzayat is optimistic that, despite the problems, a new marketing campaign will succeed in winning back the visitors he and the rest of the country's tourism industry so sorely miss. Egypt's Ministry of Tourism launched its ""We miss you"" message earlier this month, using social media to promote a glossy video that portrays the nation as a luxury destination for big spenders. Instead of focusing on the country's famed antiquities, the video features dancers, shopping malls and ritzy hotels. Campaign's crucial timing . ""I expect this campaign to bear fruit by the beginning of August,"" Elzayat says. The timing and the tone of the ""miss you"" message is crucial. With Egypt's traditional visitors from North America and Europe not expected to return in their previous numbers for years to come, the country is instead turning to wealthy Arabs from Persian Gulf nations. Up to 70% of Egypt's tourists have traditionally come from Europe, with the Gulf making up another 20%. The greatest numbers in recent times have come from Russia, followed by Germany, the UK, Italy and France. The hope is that shortfalls in traditional visitors can be made up by encouraging Arabs, particularly from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, to consider Cairo as a travel destination for this year's Eid holiday. The end to the traditional Muslim fasting month of Ramadan is due to fall on July 28. ""Arabs are definitely high spenders,"" says Elzayat. ""They shop. They gamble. They drink. They do everything."" In contrast, he says, visitors from Russia and the UK, in particular, tend to go on low-cost tours. ""You don't have big spenders coming from Russia,"" he says. ""Some of the Arabs, they are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in three days."" Gambling and drinking . Gulf Arabs are known for their love of Egyptian nightclubs and casinos, engaging in activities -- gambling and consuming alcohol -- that are forbidden in their home countries. Night is the preferred time for these tourists. Big money is dropped at casinos, in particular, the Omar Khayyam at the five-star Marriott Hotel on central Cairo's upscale Zamalek island. During a recent midday visit to the casino, before the ""We miss you"" campaign has had a chance to do its work, five middle-aged Kuwaiti men could be seen at the roulette wheel. In a matter of less than half an hour, thousands of dollars were laid out in plastic chips, and lost. It's money that's desperately needed. Since the January 2011 revolution that removed President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt's tourism industry has suffered deep losses, estimated at more than $2.5 billion on the back of a 32% drop in visitor numbers. The tourism federation says those that do visit the country are making shorter trips, leading to a 43% drop in hotel occupancy. ""But the big disaster is the decrease in the average spending,"" Elzayat says, pointing out that the average outlays were higher even two decades ago when the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and subsequent Gulf War was hurting business. ""It's down to $60 [a day] for all tourists. If you compare this figure to 1992, it was $135."" The tourism ministry says its ""We miss you"" campaign -- or ""Wahash toonah"" in Arabic -- aims to portray Egypt as a destination unruffled by upheavals, including the resurgence of violence that followed the 2013 ouster and arrest of former leader Mohamed Morsy. ""Life has never been interrupted in any of the cities,"" says ministry spokeswoman Rasha Azaizi. ""Egypt is still a safe destination, if you know where you are going and what you are doing."" Despite the ministry's assurances of safety, calm has not entirely returned to Cairo, home to some 20 million people. Travel warnings . The U.S. Department of State continues to warn travelers that ongoing political and social unrest in major cities has increased the risk of violence, including gun and explosive attacks. It warns that women have been targeted in sexual assaults. In one incident on May 19, three policemen were killed and nine others injured when unknown gunmen opened fire near a university. The attack took place when security forces confronted students loyal to Morsy's Muslim Brotherhood who were protesting against the military-led government in charge since the former leader's arrest. A government spokesman, Ehab Badawy, characterized the latest incident as an attempt to disrupt Egypt's democratic process. He pledged that a crackdown that has seen 16,000 people arrested would ""create a peaceful and stable and prosperous future."" ""There is no place in Egyptian society for those who resort to violence of any kind in an attempt to undermine the state,"" he said in a statement. One day after the killings, a trickle of foreign tourists could be seen entering Cairo's Egyptian Museum, home to the treasures of Tutankhamun's tomb, apparently unaware of the most recent attack. Brian Klipstein, 22, said he had flown in from Chicago a day earlier and had gotten up at 4:30 am Tuesday to begin a two-day visit to Egypt. He managed to tour both the Giza and Saqqara pyramids before arriving at the Egyptian Museum. ""I really like what there is to see,"" he said. ""At the same time, it's not an easy travel."" The Egyptian Museum is located on the edge of iconic Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the protests that pushed President Hosni Mubarak from office in 2011, and Morsy in 2013. To reach the museum's main entrance, Klipstein walked along a side street lined with 24 Egyptian Army tanks. ""It's a little intimidating, but it's actually a bit reassuring,"" he said. Aniqua Bokhari, another American visiting the museum, is in Cairo for the summer, interning at a UN agency. She has an unusual perspective, having been present in Egypt during the 2011 revolution and again when Morsy was removed. ""I feel completely safe,"" said Bokhari, 24, adding that she felt at ease in Cairo because her dark looks mean she is sometimes mistaken for an Egyptian. ""I say it all the time, I love Egypt and I love Egyptians. This is my favorite place.""

"New York (CNN) -- Tonalist won the 146th Belmont Stakes Saturday, denying the heavily favored California Chrome his chance to become the first Triple Crown winner in 36 years. Instead of a historic win by their favorite, the huge crowd at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, witnessed a dramatic finish in which Tonalist, ridden by Joel Rosario, overtook Commissioner in his last strides to win by a head. But the fact that none of the top three finishers had raced in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, the two prerequisites to the Triple Crown, didn't sit well with California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn. Coburn angrily told NBC Sports that the horse owners that had skipped either race before running the Belmont took ""the coward's way out."" Neither Tonalist nor Commissioner ran in the Derby or Preakness. Medal Count, the third-place finisher, didn't run in the Preakness. California Chrome appeared sluggish and finished in a dead heat for fourth with Wicked Strong in his bid to become the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978. In the 135 years the grueling series of races for 3-year-old thoroughbreds have all been contested, only 11 horses have won all three. A visibly upset Coburn said his horse ""didn't have it in him."" ""I'll never see, and I'm 61 years old, another Triple Crown winner in my lifetime because of the way they do this,"" he said. ""It's not fair to these horses that have been in the game since Day One. If you don't make enough points to get into the Kentucky Derby, you [shouldn't] run in the other two races. ... It's all or nothing because this is not fair to these horses that have been running their guts out for these people and for the people who believe in them. This is a coward's way out, in my opinion."" Tonalist owner Robert Evans declined to comment on Coburn's remarks. Tonalist covered the mile and a half in 2:28.52 and returned $20.40 to win on a $2 bet. California Chrome's jockey Victor Espinoza described his horse moments after the race as ""a little tired."" ""Turning for home I was just waiting to have the same kick like he always had before, and today he was a little bit flat down the lane,"" Espinoza said. ""I think it was tough for him. He ran back-to-back races in different tracks -- and all those fresh horses."" Rosario called his victory bittersweet. ""I'm a little bit upset about California Chrome,"" he told NBC Sports. ""If I was going to get beat, I wanted to just get beat by him."" Belmont Park has been especially unkind to Triple Crown contenders in recent years. Big Brown, a prohibitive favorite in 2008, failed to finish the Belmont, and in 2012 I'll Have Another failed to start, scratched due to an injury. The daunting Triple Crown challenge squeezes three races into a five-week period, in an era when thoroughbreds normally run no more than once a month. Adding to the rigor is the course itself: Belmont is a quarter-mile longer than Churchill Downs, home of the Derby, and five-sixteenths longer than Pimlico Race Course, where the Preakness is run. California Chrome started in the second post position -- the same gate that Secretariat shot out from in 1973 on track to Triple Crown glory and racing immortality. Tonalist was among the horses considered to be California Chrome's biggest threats, along with Ride on Curlin and Commanding Curve. The Belmont Stakes prize is about $800,000 to the winner, but in the view of some in the thoroughbred racing community, there was much, much more riding on the outcome. The beleaguered racing industry, battered for decades by gambling competition and changing entertainment tastes, stood to benefit from a Triple Crown. ""If California Chrome wins,"" Christopher Kay, CEO of the New York Racing Association, said prior to the race, ""I think it will bring a whole new generation of fans to this great sport.""

"(CNN) -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission is suing the maker of popular high-powered magnet ""desk toys"" to get them to stop selling their products, an agency spokesman said Wednesday. The magnets can pierce holes in the intestines, and some children have needed multiple surgeries and lengthy hospitalizations. Since 2009, there have been at least a dozen ingestions of the magnets in Buckyballs toys. Powerful magnets in toys raise risks from swallowing . The commission asked the makers of Buckyballs and Buckycubes to stop selling their products, but they refused, according Scott Wolfson, a spokesman for the federal agency. ""We're doing this to keep children safe,"" Wolfson said. ""We want to prevent future surgeries."" A spokesman for Maxfield & Oberton, the maker of Buckyballs and Buckycubes, said the company ""will fight this vigorously."" ""There are half a billion magnets out there, and unfortunately there are some people who have misused the product,"" said Andrew Frank. ""We market these products to adults age 14 and above, and there are warning labels on the product."" There are warning labels to keep the magnets away from children on five places on each box, and in accompanying instructions. A public awareness campaign about magnet safety with videos distributed by the government and a special website (www.magnetsafety.com) was launched several months ago, with the full cooperation of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the company said. The company's website also has warnings posted next to the images of the products. ""Obviously the bureaucrats see danger everywhere, and those responsible people -- like our company who have vigorously promoted safety and appropriate use of our products -- gets put out of business by an unfair and arbitrary process,"" said Craig Zucker, founder and CEO of Maxfield and Oberton. ""I don't understand how and why they did this without following their own rules before allowing us to make our case. It almost seems like they simply wanted to put our products and industry out of business."" Magnetic stress relievers called health danger for kids . On Friday, Maxfield and Oberton launched a video campaign to help educate consumers about ongoing safety efforts, as well as ""protest the actions of the Consumer Product Safety Commission,"" it said in a statement. The video can be viewed on the company's website as well as the campaign website. Since 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has received 200 reports of ingestion of magnets of all kinds, Wolfson said. The analysis released Wednesday showed more than 20 ingestions were of high-powered, ""rare earth"" magnets. In June, pediatric gastroenterologists met with the Consumer Product Safety Commission and shared the results of an informal survey. Thirty-four physicians reported 82 cases of high-powered magnet ingestions, most in children under age five. Surgery was required in 26 cases to remove the magnets and nearly all required some type of endoscopy procedure. ""We have worked with the company over the years,"" Wolfson said. ""We did a recall with them in 2010. Yet the injuries still happened. In 2011 we worked with them on the education of consumers. Incidents still happened. So we've reached a point where we really do need to take stronger action, which we're doing. We're filing a lawsuit."" Several retailers, including Amazon and Brookstone, have agreed to stop selling the magnets. The Consumer Product Safety Commission rarely files such administrative complaints -- the last time it did was 11 years ago against the maker of BB guns, Wolfson said. ""So many parents don't know about this hazard,"" Wolfson said. ""They buy the products for themselves. Maybe their child gets access to it. Maybe they give it to their child. ""And the parents just need to know that two or more magnets are swallowed by a child, even a teenager -- we've had incidents with both young children and teenagers -- it can get caught in the small intestine, form an infection and then emergency surgery is needed. We want to avoid that."" Wolfson added that the agency is continuing to look at the safety of other brands of small, high-powered ""rare earth"" magnets. Meaghin Jordan, whose son swallowed high-powered magnets, said she was ""relieved"" to hear about the complaint. When he was almost 2 years old, her son Braylon swallowed eight magnets and spent two months in the hospital, most of that time in intensive care. ""This is wonderful,"" she said. ""I'm very glad they're taking action. If they can't sell them, then no one else can get hurt."" Mattel CEO: 'Rigorous standards' after massive toy recall .

"(CNN) -- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo went into hiding last week, canceling appearances and perhaps hoping that a blast of sharply negative press coverage -- triggered by a hard-hitting front-page New York Times story -- will somehow fade away. That was wishful thinking: The bad press isn't going to vanish anytime soon. Cuomo faces a crater-sized pothole in the road between the governor's office at the state capital in Albany and the much more important, oval-shaped one in Washington that he dreams of someday occupying. And he has nobody to blame but himself. The Times published a trove of e-mails and interviews that show top Cuomo aides actively interfered with a high-level anti-corruption investigative panel -- in ways that benefited big-money donors to Cuomo -- even after Cuomo personally and repeatedly vowed the commission would be independent. When the anti-corruption commission issued a subpoena to a firm that prints and promotes campaign items, the governor's top aide, Larry Schwartz, ordered the commission to drop the inquiry. ""Pull it back,"" Schwartz told commission staff, according to the Times. Other supporters of Cuomo got similar protected treatment -- and Cuomo ended up abruptly disbanding the panel before its work was completed or a final report issued. After five days of silence, Cuomo announced -- at 11 p.m. on a Sunday -- that he would take questions Monday in Buffalo, far from the New York City media capital. In the course of answering reporters, Cuomo changed his story once again, claiming the commission had ""total independence,"" a direct about-face from his office's detailed 13-page claim that the investigation was always under full control of the governor's office. That might seem like an obscure local matter, but New York -- including New York City, the media capital -- has been through a decade of nearly constant official corruption that shows no signs of slowing. In the last 10 years, more than 30 state officials have been indicted, convicted, censured or otherwise accused of financial or personal improprieties. One former governor, Eliot Spitzer, made national headlines by resigning after acknowledging hiring prostitutes, and his successor, David Paterson, was hit with a $62,000 fine for taking free tickets to a baseball game and lying about it. An ex-state comptroller, Alan Hevesi, recently completed 20 months in prison for taking $1 million in gifts from a financial operator seeking business from the state's pension fund. And a depressing parade of state legislators have marched into prison year after year: They are a United Nations of chicanery: Republicans, Democrats, Irish, Italian, Jewish, black, Latino and Asian. One miscreant, former Assemblyman Brian McLaughlin (serving a 10-year sentence) stole from a local Little League team, among other organizations. Another thief, former Assemblyman Anthony Seminerio, got a dose of rough justice when he died inside the walls of a federal prison a few months into a six-year sentence for fraud. Before trying his hand at politics Seminerio had worked as a prison guard. Those highlights barely scratch the surface of a corruption problem that New Yorkers have stoically come to accept as the new normal. A recent poll finds that an astounding two-thirds of New Yorkers believe that state politicians ""do what's best for them and their political friends and it never surprises me when another one gets indicted."" But Cuomo was supposed to be a cure for the culture of corruption; he ran for governor with a vow to clean up Albany. And after years of failing to persaude the legislature to implement anti-corruption measures like meaningful contribution limits and a requirement to have legislators disclose all sources of outside income, Cuomo took the major step of creating a 25-member blue-ribbon panel to root out wrongdoing, called the Moreland Commission, that was led by two district attorneys. Cuomo repeatedly promised the commission would be independent, and that it could investigate anyone -- including the governor himself -- in service to the goal of uncovering and rooting out official corruption. But Cuomo broke his promise: As the Times story details, Cuomo's aides frequently blocked action by the commission in a way that spared the governor's allies and donors any public embarrassment. And despite a preliminary report indicating deep-seated problems in detecting or stopping corruption, Cuomo dissolved the panel after nine months without so much as thanking members for their service or requesting a final report. The panel had served its purpose, said Cuomo, by pressuring the legislature to pass a watered-down version of ethics reform that good-government groups ridiculed as ineffective. In response to the Times story, Cuomo's aides prepared a 13-page masterpiece of doubletalk and hokum, arguing that the Moreland Commission could be disbanded at any time at the whim of the governor. That might be true in a narrow legal sense, but the governor is now being excoriated for falsely telling the public he had formed an independent panel. 4 reasons Christie keeps moving forward . ""The governor is a liar and almost anything he promises will turn out to be false, "" is how longtime columnist Fred Dicker of the New York Post bluntly put it. The Times was only slightly less direct, noting that ""It is up to the voters to decide whether to go on endorsing business as usual. ... New Yorkers will have to decide if their representatives are politicians they can trust, including Mr. Cuomo."" The worst skewering might have come from Jon Stewart of ""The Daily Show"" on the Comedy Central channel, who ridiculed Cuomo mercilessly and dismissed the governor's tortured explanation for dissolving the Moreland Commission as ""effing ridiculous."" A much less funny critique has been launched by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who has vowed to pick up where Cuomo's commission left off and continue searching for corruption in Albany. Along the way, Bharara is expected to investigate whether meddling by Cuomo's staff broke any laws. No wonder Cuomo's been ducking the press. But he can't keep it up forever. People have a right to know when powerful officials switch their tune in an election year. That goes double for early states in the presidential race, like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. It may be too early to speculate about whether Cuomo intends to run for president, but it's safe to say that deep-sixing an anti-corruption panel looks like politics as usual, exactly what voters are telling pollsters they won't tolerate. Cuomo should take a page from his neighbor, Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has been far more adept at handling the more serious ""Bridgegate"" scandal, in which thousands of commuters were subjected to paralyzing traffic jams for days on end, for what appears to be the pettiest of political reasons. Unlike Cuomo's duck-and-cover strategy, Christie summarily sacked several close advisers, held a marathon news conference at which he answered dozens of questions, and hired a law firm to investigate his own conduct (an inquiry that, not surprisingly, cleared Christie). The New Jersey governor isn't out of the woods by any means, but he continues to be a sought-after speaker on the GOP circuit and is still considered a contender for the 2016 presidential nomination. That's more than anybody can say for Andrew Cuomo these days.","The Times found N.Y. Gov. Cuomo's aides interfered with anti-corruption panel .

"(CNN) -- Harry Reid recently sallied forth with a series of attacks on Mitt Romney that had the desired effect. It created headlines. It stirred up the anti-Romney base of the Democratic Party. And it really irritated the Romney camp. It has produced waves of condemnation because of the unsubstantiated assertions that Romney didn't pay taxes for a decade. Reince Preibus, head of the Republican National Committee, called Reid ""a dirty liar."" Democrats responded that this was a problem Romney brought on himself. All he would have to do is release his tax returns to end the dust-up. But of course, this is one dust-up that will never end. Because in modern politics it seems the goal is to constantly find ways to smear the opposition, facts and decency be damned. That's the reason the birther lie endures. That's the reason that John Kerry, whose military service was distinguished, could be besmirched by the ""swift boaters"" and a host of political opponents who hadn't anything like his record of service. And because both sides do it to one another, it is considered to be fair play. Only in politics can what's clearly foul be fair. News: Reid puts GOP in a bind over Romney's taxes . Support his policies or oppose them, no one is for one minute suggesting that Mitt Romney did anything other than obey the tax laws of the United States. The reason that Democrats want to see the tax returns is not because they think he did something wrong but because he did something that might look unseemly. Like he was a rich guy taking advantage of loopholes. That virtually anyone in his position would do so is irrelevant. It's all about the smear. The same is true with the attacks on Romney's tenure at Bain Capital. Romney is not being attacked for breaking the law (except by a few semanticists, who seem to be naÃ¯vely, yet deliberately, suggesting it was not possible for him to be chairman on paper but to be taking a leave of absence from daily operating responsibilities). He is being attacked because it might look bad that companies he was involved with actually outsourced jobs or fired people. That he was fulfilling his responsibility to his shareholders in doing so and that the record of Bain was fairly good in terms of value creation is irrelevant when the objective is creating a negative narrative at all costs. I have voted Democrat all my life. I served in the Clinton administration and worked for a Democratic congressman on Capitol Hill. I will vote for President Obama. But I deplore these tactics. Opinion: Why won't Romney release more tax returns? When Harry Reid goes on the floor of the Senate and makes assertions like he did, he demeans the institution. Which is saying something about an institution that is as dysfunctional as the U.S. Senate. When the Obama team systematically goes after Romney for his business background, it makes sense as a political tactic, but it reveals deep insecurity about his case for re-election and it alienates the business community unnecessarily. As my old boss, the late Ron Brown, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, used to say, ""You can't be for jobs and against the people who create them."" America is facing unprecedented challenges. Our economy doesn't work the way it once did. It is growing more slowly. It is rebounding from crisis more slowly. It is not creating jobs as it has. It is not creating wealth for the population at large the way it used to. Inequality is growing. Our competitiveness is faltering even as competition is growing. Yet we have great opportunities before us. A new energy mix can free us of dependency on dangerous nations, create jobs and a cleaner environment at home. Our economy is well poised to lead a ""Third Industrial Revolution,"" driven by high value-added manufacturing in which intellectual capital, the kind we create especially well, is the critical input. We protect that capital better than many of our competitors, too. We're in a position to remake our infrastructure, as must be done thanks to very low interest rates, if only we could come to understand the difference between spending and investing. We need to rethink our convoluted tax structure, our broken fiscal system, our corrupt campaign finance system and the way we defend ourselves and project our force worldwide. It is beyond arguing that we need to do something about gun control in this country. These are great issues calling for serious debate. And we actually have two candidates for president who are credible, serious men. But they are running a campaign that has the sensibilities and IQ of a typical middle school student council election. With the values of an episode of ""Real Housewives"" or ""Big Brother."" Apparently, the candidates and their advisers think that is what will work with us. They think we don't see the big problems, care about them or understand them. They think that throwing mud and unsubstantiated claims and getting bogged down in distractions will tip the scales in their favor. So the sad punch line to all this pettiness is that in a campaign laden with name calling, the biggest insult of all is the one that is being directed at the American people. Amid all the dirt and the shallowness, this is the one that should produce the greatest outrage. But of all of them, it's also the only one that could produce any good at all. It could get us to act and demand more and to reject negative campaigns. Take it personally. Every time you hear a politician sling mud at an opponent rather than addressing a real issue, recognize that you're the one being dissed. Then do us all a favor and vote your anger. Demand better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Harry Reid made attacks on Romney that riled anti-Romney base and Romney, too .

"(CNN) -- A Los Angeles Police officer was caught on an audio recording allegedly making racial slurs during an encounter with some young black men outside a bar in Norco, California. The incident took place in 2012, according to a report this week by CBS-LA reporter David Goldstein, which included audio of the the officer's remarks. And a panel assembled to conduct a formal disciplinary hearing subsequently recommended that the cop, Shaun Hillmann, be fired. But LAPD Chief Charlie Beck overruled the decision, issuing a 65-day suspension instead. Apparently, Chief Charlie Beck thinks it is tolerable to have officers on the beat who use the N-word -- as a bar security guard alleged Hillman did -- and refer to young black men as ""monkeys,"" as Hillman can be heard doing on the audio recording. Now, I acknowledge Hillman was off duty. But a law enforcement officer is sworn to uphold and enforce our laws equally among our citizens without regard to skin color, and has no right to bigotry even while off duty, even while upset or even while impaired. When I think about officer Hillman's alleged encounter, I am reminded again of the troubling overrepresentation of black men in the criminal justice system. Nearly 1 of every 100 Americans serves jail time, and there are nearly six times as many black inmates as there are whites. Is that because some cops think the use of the N-word is acceptable or think of young black men as ""monkeys?"" Or perhaps it has something to do with what President Barack Obama addressed when he remarked that ""African-American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system, that they are disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence."" Or, more likely, it's a self-reciprocating reaction to both. If some cops exhibit racism, are black men justified in being distrustful of cops? If black men are more likely to be seen as perpetrators of violence, are cops justified in being more wary of black men? Should you be tempted to ask yourself ""which came first?"" -- that will take you back to a time when virtually all black men in America were in shackles, and that line of thinking isn't productive. A better question to ask is ""Who is in the best position to break the cycle?"" The answer is this: The person in authority. In our communities, police officers are the face of authority. They are the first responders to calls for justice or help. When they respond to a call, they decide how to treat the parties involved. They decide whether or not to make an arrest. As a society that struggles with a deep race problem, we have to trust that our police officers are not racists. When we encounter a cop who displays blatant bigotry -- even when he is off duty -- we cannot tolerate it. By allowing the officer who allegedly made these racial slurs to remain on the force -- even after a disciplinary board rules that he should be fired -- LAPD Chief Beck has sent a message to all young black men in Los Angeles that his officers are not to be trusted. This could have disastrous consequences for all the LAPD officers who are honorable and serve their community with integrity and who treat citizens with respect. Allowing racist officers to remain on the beat institutionalizes racism and it endangers good cops. In the face of this, here are some things to remember if you're a young black man, and you encounter a racist cop: Be better than the cop. If you allow an officer to provoke you, you're much more likely to be arrested. Whatever you say will be put in the police report, and it will be used against you by the prosecutor. If you run, or resist, or fight, it will be used against you. It makes it harder for defense attorneys like me to help, and in the end, one gross injustice can be compounded by another. But that doesn't mean anyone should stand by and do nothing. More and more police departments record interactions between citizens and police. When there is evidence of racism in these transactions, report it. Report it and demand action. We can start with demanding action from LAPD Chief Charlie Beck.","Mark O'Mara: LAPD cop caught on audio recording allegedly making racial slurs outside bar .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When Nina Temple was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2000, then aged 44, she quickly became depressed, barely venturing out of her house as she struggled to come to terms with living with the chronic condition. Sing for Joy is a choir made up of sufferers of neurological conditions plus friends, family and carers. ""I was thinking of all the things which I wished I'd done with my life and I wouldn't be able to do. And then I started thinking about all the things that I still actually could do and singing was one of those,"" Temple told CNN. Along with a fellow Parkinson's sufferer, Temple decided, on a whim, to form a choir. The pair placed notices in doctor's surgeries inviting others to join them and advertised for a singing teacher. By 2003, with the help of funding from the Parkinson's Disease Society, the resulting ensemble ""Sing For Joy"" was up and running, rehearsing weekly and soon graduating to public performances. The group now consists of around two dozen singers, including sufferers of Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis, others recovering from conditions including stroke or cancer, plus their carers, family and friends. Led by acclaimed jazz performer Carol Grimes, the group's genre-defying repertoire ranges from Cole Porter classics to ethnic punk.  Watch Sing for Joy perform » . ""It's quite easy to get overwhelmed by the disease and having something that you do every week that makes you forget all your troubles and keeps you from feeling isolated is a great pleasure,"" says Temple. But singing also has physical and neurological benefits for the choir's members. A common symptom of Parkinson's disease and similar conditions is voice loss and each week the group begins its rehearsals with vocal exercises worked out with speech therapists. ""All neurological conditions affect the throat because it has so many muscles,"" says Sarah Benton, another choir member with multiple sclerosis. ""So singing, which makes you lift up your body and expand your lungs, is perfect for neurological diseases."" While ""Sing for Joy's"" DIY-style music therapy has provided obvious social, mental and physical benefits for its members, there is a growing body of clinical evidence suggesting that music can play a key role in aiding recovery or helping sufferers cope with a broad range of brain-based conditions. Does music affect your mood or have particular physical or mental benefits? Sound Off below . Doctor Wendy Magee, International Fellow in Music Therapy at London's Institute of Neuropalliative Rehabilitation, describes music as a ""mega-vitamin for the brain,"" capable of influencing and improving motor function, communication and even cognition. ""When neural pathways are damaged for one particular function such as language, musical neural pathways are actually much more complex and much more widespread within the brain,"" Magee told CNN. ""Music seems to find re-routed paths and that is why it is such a useful tool in terms of helping people with different kinds of brain damage because it can help to find new pathways in terms of brain functioning."" Researchers in Finland have demonstrated that listening to music for several hours a day can enhance the rehabilitation of stroke patients. In another study, stroke patients who were taught to play the piano or drums made speedier progress in their general recovery than patients who received only traditional therapy. At Colorado State University, researchers have used musical and rhythmic cues as an effective tool to improve the movement and balance of Parkinson's disease sufferers and those with other degenerative diseases. Melodic Intonation Therapy, in which musical exercises are used to improve speech, has proved an effective treatment for patients with aphasia, a disorder that results from damage to portions of the brain responsible for language. Musical memories also seem to be more resilient to neural degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and dementia, enabling therapists to use familiar tunes to cue memories which might otherwise have been lost. One American World War II veteran whose dementia was so severe he couldn't remember his own name and would barely acknowledge his own wife was brought alive through ballroom dancing and the music of Frank Sinatra, the sufferer still able to lead his wife through the foxtrot as if it was the 1940s. The power of music to enhance moods and emotions has long been harnessed by psychologists, but, as Dr. Lauren Stewart, director of a recently established course in Music, Mind and Brain at Goldsmiths University of London told CNN, ""recent advances in neuroscience and brain imaging technology are now radically transforming conventional music therapy into a more rigorous and research-based clinical practice."" Professor Michael Thaut of Colorado State University's Center for Biomedical Research in Music, who has helped pioneer a new research-based approach known as Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT), says recent developments amount to a ""paradigm shift."" ""Therapists in all fields have been doing things for decades; now they're trying to figure out the research to support their work,"" Thaut told CNN. ""NMT started as a science and now it's turning into a clinical field. And that's very exciting."" For now NMT remains on the fringes of standard neurological rehabilitation. But Magee believes its application and a general move away from psychoanalytical approaches dominant in the past, could bring music therapy towards the mainstream and make it an ever more effective tool. ""We are now starting to see the evidence for why we see things work. That also means we can fine tune what we do because we understand more about the neurological processing behind it,"" she said. ""But we're still at the point where we need to build the evidence base and translate that evidence base into practice so we can convince funders that music therapy is an important part of rehab practice."" For the members of Sing For Joy however, the proof of the therapeutic power of music is already self-evident. ""There is something about coming together and making a communal sound,"" said Sarah Benton. ""There is nothing like it and it's wonderful.""","London choir is made up of sufferers of neurological conditions, friends and carers .

"Washington (CNN) -- It might remind you of the new smash-hit James Bond movie ""Skyfall"", in which the villains steal a device with top secret information on the identities of British agents. But in this case, sensitive data was left on a subway train. Law enforcement and congressional sources tell CNN a contractor working for the U.S. Secret Service accidentally left a pouch containing two computer backup tapes on a train in Washington's Metrorail subway system. The tapes contained very sensitive Secret Service personnel and investigative information, and if accessed could be highly damaging, according to sources. The contractor was transporting the pouch from Secret Service headquarters in Washington to a now-closed data facility in Maryland. The sources say the contractor got off a Metro train, and later realized the pouch had been left behind. The Secret Service and the Metro police were contacted, and an aggressive search took place. According to one source, the tapes have not been recovered. The incident occurred nearly five years ago, in February 2008. It is now the subject of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General, according to a congressional source. That office would not comment on why the investigation is taking place now, or on any other aspect of the investigation. Eric O'Neill, a former FBI counterespionage agent, said, ""Some of the information could cause lives to be at risk, if someone wanted to get at the families of a high-level government worker or someone they perceived as being someone who could work against, say, a terrorist cell."" O'Neill is the agent who took down Robert Hanssen, an FBI official who spied for the Soviet Union and Russia in the 1980s and 1990s. The Secret Service says no lives were put at risk, and no fraud was committed as a result of the loss. But why would the agency put sensitive information on a removable set of tapes? ""Part of the reason, I think ... is that in 2008 when this occurred, some of the information might have been on removable discs because that's how they transported information,"" O'Neill told CNN. ""We've leapt forward in technology since then."" The Secret Service issued a statement acknowledging the loss of information. ""These back-up tapes were not marked or identified in any way and were protected by multiple layers of security.,"" it said. ""They could not be accessed without the proper equipment, applications and encoding."" There is conflicting information on whether the tapes were encrypted. O'Neill, a partner at the security firm The Georgetown Group, says even if they were, ""this is 2008 encryption. And years later, our abilities to break encryption, our algorithms to do that, are much, much better. If those tapes were found, I'm sure they could be cracked in moments."" A Secret Service official did not provide the name of the individual who left the tapes on the train, or the name of the contracting firm. The official would not comment on whether the individual was disciplined, and said he is not sure if the agency still does business with the firm. O'Neill has his own questions about the incident. ""Why did a contractor have it?"" he asks.""Why wasn't it chained to his wrist with a handcuff in a case that he would, the second he stood up, think 'I need to grab it'?"" Asked those questions by CNN, a Secret Service official did not answer directly, but instead referred to part of the agency's statement saying, ""Subsequent to this incident the Secret Service instituted protocols to prevent this from happening again."" CNN's Mike Ahlers and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Secret Service information was left on D.C. subway system in 2008 .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Heavy rains and flooding in Pakistan's southeastern Sindh province have killed some 226 people over the past month, the National Disaster Management Authority said Tuesday. The dead include 34 children and 59 women, said an agency summary. In all, 5.3 million people have been affected by the flooding, and 1.19 million homes have been damaged, the authority said. The flooding has inundated more than 4.5 million acres and damaged an estimated 80% of crops. And the heavy rains are not over. ""Meteorological conditions indicate that a strong weather system is developing over central parts of India that would cause widespread heavy rains in Pakistan during the coming week,"" said a weather advisory posted on the disaster agency's web site. ""Heavy to very heavy rainfall may generate severe flooding in lower Sindh,"" as well as flash flooding in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkwa and Balochistan provinces, the advisory said. The United Nations was making arrangements to provide food supplies to half a million people for the next month in Sindh, and it was also set to supply 20,000 tents this week, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported Monday. A U.N. team was visiting Pakistan in response to a phone conversation between Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the news agency reported. Aid is also flowing in from other countries. On Monday, the Chinese ambassador to Pakistan presented a $50,000 check to the National Disaster Management Authority and has also promised $4.7 million in aid to flooded areas as well as  tents, the authority said on its web site.

"Gaza City (CNN) -- Violence erupted in and around Gaza on Saturday, as Hamas security forces roughed up demonstrators and journalists, and five people were wounded in cross-border fighting. Security forces stormed the offices of international news organizations after the violent break-up of a small demonstration in Gaza City on Saturday, witnesses said. Journalists covering that event were roughed up, they said. They raided the offices of CNN, Reuters and Japanese broadcaster NHK, all in the same building where international news operations are located. Reuters bureau chief for Israel and the Palestinian territories, Crispian Balmer, said one employee was beaten with an iron rod and another was threatened with being thrown out the window. He said a camera was confiscated but was later returned. A TV and a computer keyboard were destroyed by the security forces. The forces forcibly entered the CNN office, demanding to see whether there was any television equipment and asking if anyone had been shooting video footage from the office. NHK Jerusalem bureau chief Disuke Iijima said videotape had been confiscated. No one was hurt at CNN and NHK. After the incidents, Gaza-based journalists, many of whom work for international news organizations, staged a sit-in in Gaza City to protest the government's tactics and promised a boycott of Hamas press events. The office raids came immediately after uniformed and plain-clothes Hamas security officials broke up a small student rally calling for political unity between the two major Palestinian political parties, Hamas and Fatah. The split developed after clashes between Hamas and Fatah in 2007 that led to Hamas seizing control in Gaza, and Fatah maintaining control of the West Bank. It was the second time in a week that Hamas has cracked down on media covering street demonstrations inside the coastal enclave. On Tuesday, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets calling for political reconciliation. According to witnesses, security forces beat up and detained several protesters and journalists covering the rally. The Tel Aviv-based Foreign Press Association released a statement expressing its ""grave concern"" that Hamas security forces ""brutally attacked photographers and cameramen, beating them, breaking equipment and confiscating photos and video footage."" The organization called the developments the latest in ""string of of chilling attacks on reporters in Gaza."" Meanwhile, the cross-border violence between Israel and Gaza led to five injuries. Israeli air raids in Gaza on Saturday badly wounded three children, a hospital official in Gaza City said. But the Israel Defense Forces said it launched strikes after dozens of mortar shells were fired from Gaza into southern Israel. The IDF said troops fired tank shells and helicopters backed forces on the ground. It had no comment on the three injured people, one of whom is in critical condition. But the IDF said two Israeli civilians received minor injuries. Israel said three mortars landed in the regional council of Shalom and two in the regional council of Eshkol. Israel said it won't allow Israel's southern communities to ""continue living under constant threat"" and it holds Hamas, the Palestinian movement that governs Gaza, ""responsible for any terrorist activity emanating from the Gaza Strip."" Constant rocket fire into southern Israel by Palestinian militants prompted Israel to launch its three-week offensive against in Gaza from late 2008 into January 2009.","NEW: Hamas security breaks up demo, raids offices .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Budget Committee, is known to glide through the hallways of Capitol Hill with headphones in his ears. It's a tactic he employs to avoid pesky reporters. But the Republican faced down a flurry of questions on Wednesday at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast with journalists. The potential White House contender offered up his views on a range of topics, like climate change, immigration reform, and his newly-released plan to overhaul federal poverty programs. He bristled at political questions, particularly one about his 2016 thinking. He opted to focus on policy matters and pepper his answers with the kind of opaque beltway jargon â€” terms like ""pay-fors"" and ""scoring"" â€” that betray his Washington pedigree. Ryan, a known fitness buff, ordered a pile of eggs and a side of fruit, declining the sausages and potatoes typically served at the Monitor breakfasts, a Washington political ritual. Here's some of what he said: . On impeaching President Barack Obama: ""I see this as sort of a ridiculous gambit by the President and his political team to try and change the narrative, raise money and turn out their base and raise money for an election that isn't going to go their way. And I will just leave it at that."" On the House Republican lawsuit against Obama: ""What John (Boehner) is doing is expressing frustration that we are not using the power of the purse. All he is trying to do is stand up for congressional prerogatives. And that is why the lawsuit has intellectual merit, because we want to show that we are not going to take this sitting down."" ""The President is issuing executive orders and regulations that exceed the parameters of the statutes that give the authority in the first place. It's important to make that distinction. That's why I will vote for it. Because I stand with the speaker in thinking that the President has exceeded his authority. Let's make sure that we don't serve the temptation that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter, is the superior branch of government on all things constitutional. That's not necessarily the case."" So why not impeach?: ""This does not rise to the high crimes and misdemeanor level. This is a huge difference of opinion which can be litigated in the court of public opinion through elections, which should be litigated through Congress through appropriations and the power of the purse, and there are other routes that are being pursued. But in this case, I think the President has exceeded the statutory boundaries that are written into the laws. There are executive orders that are within the boundaries of statutes to implement and execute laws. But when you do things, regulations and executive orders, that exceed the statutes, the clear letter of the law, that is lawmaking. And the lawmaking occurs in the legislative branch, not the executive branch."" On opposing reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank: ""I do believe that the Ex-Im Bank is representational of some of the crony capitalism that we have in Washington: Big government and big business joining in a common cause to hand out preferences. I believe that we as Republicans should be pro-market, not necessarily pro-business. And that means pro-market is fighting for equal access to opportunity, the rule of law, self-government and fairness."" ""With the Ex-Im Bank, when most of the money goes to a handful of really large connected companies, and a lot of it just goes to one company, that to me isn't quality under the law. That to me isn't free enterprise. ... Could the thing be reformed? Of course. Is that better than the status quo? Yes. But at the end of the day, I really do believe there are so many more things we should be dedicating taxpayer resources to than handing it out to select companies."" On what government can do to fight climate change: ""Climate change occurs no matter what. The question is, can and should the federal government do something about it? And I would argue the federal government, with all its tax and regulatory schemes, can't. And all it will do is end up hurting our country, our people, and especially low income individuals."" On whether House Republicans will support some kind of immigration reform before the next presidential election: ""It's hard to see in this climate, it really is. I think we need to deal narrowly with the border crisis. But because of the demonstrated distrust of the President in enforcing the laws, it is very hard to see how Republicans can come together with a solution that we expect the president to enforce."" ""You know that I am a fan of immigration reform. I have been in favor of immigration reform for many, many years. We have a broken system that needs fixing, for the rule of law, for national security, for economic security. But having said all of that, there is just no confidence or faith that the President will faithfully discharge his duties in executes and implementing the laws as written by Congress at this time."" On his draft proposal to restructure federal poverty programs: ""In many cases, the federal government, in its war on poverty, has inadvertently displaced civil society, prodded out good things that are happening in our communities, when it should be supporting them. It should be manning supply lines, not dictating the front lines."" ""And the other point, it has given the notion in our society that this isn't your problem. Pay your taxes. The government will fix this. The government fixes poverty. That's not true. We need to break those notions that so that everybody gets involved and does something in whatever way they can to make a difference in this area. And that is one of the messages we need to pound over and over and over if we are going to be successful in reintegrating the poor and getting them from where the are to where they want to be."" On whether he would support the restoration of voting rights for felons: ""I think that's something that we should look at. It's something we need to definitely consider. The way I look at this is, we want to encourage the notion that people should be able to earn and deserve a second chance in life. That is how you get people from where they are to the better life that they aspire for themselves. And that should be is something that we should champion in society. And I think this is among the issues that ought to be considered."" Is that a theme the GOP must do a better job of championing? ""I don't want to comment on that."" On his thinking about a possible presidential bid in 2016: ""There really aren't deliberations. I am just doing my job, focusing on the here and now, on 2014, on the problems that are facing our country that I see in front of me right now."" ""I consciously decided not to think about my personal ambitions or personal career moves, or how I can think about something after 2014. In 2015, at the appropriate time, Janna and I will sit down and have the proper deliberations and conversations that are necessary for that. But right now, I am focused on what I can in my job today. I think that's just a better use of my time, and it's more faithful to the people I represent to be focusing on what's in front of us at this time.""

"(CNN) -- It was only after a crowd of screaming students ran past Darnell Rodgers in a stairway at his Cleveland, Ohio, high school Wednesday afternoon that he realized he had been shot. ""They were screaming, 'Oh my God! Oh my God,'"" said Rodgers, a senior at SuccessTech Academy near downtown Cleveland. Rodgers suddenly felt his arm ""burning,"" he said, and realized he had been shot in the elbow. Police have started to piece together what happened. At around 1:15 p.m. ET, 14-year-old gunman Asa Coon, who was a student at the school, walked the halls firing a gun in each hand, Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath said. When it was all over, five people had been shot, but the only fatality was Coon, who police said killed himself in a classroom. Police found a .22- caliber revolver and .38-caliber revolver near Coon's body, along with a box of ammunition and three knives, said McGrath. Investigators have reason to believe some victims were specifically targeted by Coon, who had been suspended from school Monday.  Watch what happened at the school -- and the warning signs » . ""We do not believe this was a random shooting,"" McGrath said. ""It may have been the teachers he went to the school looking for. ... I believe they disciplined him in some manner."" Rodgers was treated and released from the hospital, but others were more seriously injured. Coon shot 57-year-old teacher David Kachadourian in the back and shot a 42-year-old teacher in the chest, officials said. Edward Eckart, commissioner of EMS Cleveland, said the 42-year-old underwent surgery at MetroHealth Medical Center and was in stable condition at 8 p.m. Wednesday. Fifty-seven-year-old Kachadourian was in stable condition, he said. In addition, a 15-year-old male with a gunshot wound to his side and a 15-year-old female with a knee injury were transported to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, where they were in stable condition Wednesday night, Eckart said. McGrath said Coon and another student were suspended Monday after they apparently got in a fight outside the school. Coon had a previous arrest last year for a domestic violence incident, and police had been to his home before for incidents that involved weapons, according to McGrath. Police searched the gunman's locker after the shooting and are watching surveillance footage of the school taken at the time of the shooting, he said. Students said they took cover in closets after the school principal announced a ""Code Blue"" on the intercom. Students described the gunman as being ""odd."" Rodgers spoke to reporters after leaving the hospital Wednesday evening. He called the shooting ""very shocking"" and said he was ""sad"" it could happen at a school he thought was safe.

Recreation centers will be open and counselors will be available for city residents. Friday was already going to be a professional day for faculty and will now be devoted to figuring out how to go about resuming classes on Monday. Cleveland Municipal School District CEO Eugene Sanders said the community and everyone with ties to SuccessTech needs ""to take a breather and relax a moment and put this in perspective."" SuccessTech is a nontraditional high school, according to local school officials. ""Since it is a specialty school,"" it doesn't have ""the typical population of a large high school,"" said Lisa Matthews of the superintendent's office. It is a ""school of choice"" -- students have to apply to get in, said Ruthie Williams, also of the superintendent's office. She said classrooms are on the first and third floors of the four-story building and the rest contains the school district's administrative offices. The academy describes itself on its Web site as a ""small, nontraditional high school that provides a learning environment in which all student believe in their ability to succeed."" It adds that the curriculum is ""problem-based"" and ""infused"" with technology. The school was founded in part with a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. No metal detectors were at the school on Wednesday, although the school board has portable detectors that are randomly moved from school to school, McGrath said. An armed security guard was at the front desk, he added. E-mail to a friend .","Police chief: Teen gunman may have targeted some victims .
