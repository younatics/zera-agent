"(CNN) -- The remains of an Air Force major missing since the Vietnam War have been identified after years of searches, the Department of Defense said. Air Force Maj. Curtis Daniel Miller of Palacios, Texas, was one of 14 men whose plane was shot down on March 29, 1972. Miller and his crew were flying over southern Laos when a missile struck their plane, the Defense Department said Tuesday. After the shoot-down, rescue teams had to call off the search after two days because of heavy fighting near the crash site in Savannakhet province. In 1986, U.S. and Laotian search teams found the remains of nine of the men who were on the plane. In 2005 and 2006, search teams found more remains. DNA tests have confirmed that they belong to Miller and the other missing crew members. Miller will be buried with full military honors at the Dallas-Ft. Worth National Cemetery on March 29.","Maj.

"(CNN)  -- The American Civil Liberties Union is pushing for a quick legal decision, hoping to save a high school prom that was allegedly canceled because two lesbians wanted to attend it together. The rights group filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against a Mississippi school district and high school in federal court Tuesday over the April 2 prom. The case will be argued before a federal judge in Mississippi on March 22, the ACLU said. The showdown stems from a complaint by 18-year-old Constance McMillen, who said she was told not to bring her girlfriend to the prom or wear a tuxedo. The prom was canceled after the ACLU demanded that McMillen's high school change its policy. ""I never thought the school would try to cancel the prom and hurt everyone just to keep me and my girlfriend from going together,"" McMillen said in an ACLU news release. ""A lot of people have made really generous offers to pay for a prom somewhere else, which I really appreciate. But all I've ever wanted was to be able to just go to my own school's prom with my girlfriend."" The motion filed Tuesday is part of a lawsuit that the ACLU has filed against the Itawamba County School District and Itawamba Agricultural High School. At the center of the lawsuit is a memorandum from the school to students, dated February 5, which says that prom dates must be of the opposite sex. Also, when McMillen expressed a desire to wear a tuxedo to the prom, the district superintendent told her only male students were allowed to wear them, according to court documents. Superintendent Teresa McNeece also told McMillen that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if other students complained about their presence, according to the documents. School district officials could not be reached for comment. But the county's board of education said in a statement last week that ""Due to the distractions to the educational process caused by recent events, the Itawamba County School District has decided to not host a prom at Itawamba Agricultural High School this year."" The ACLU aims to change that. ""We are determined to get the prom back on the calendar and open to all students,"" said ACLU lawyer Christine Sun. ""What this case comes down to is the school taking the extraordinary measure of canceling the prom, rather than live up to its legal obligation to fairly treat all students who want to come to it.""","Group files motion for preliminary injunction against a Mississippi school district .

"(CNN) -- As the NCAA basketball tournament kicks into gear this week, March Madness once again spreads out of arenas and into the workplace. Diehard and fair-weather fans alike will take part in office pools, games will be streamed online, and smack will be talked around water coolers. ""People love Cinderellas,"" the come-from-behind stories, said Stewart Mandel, a senior writer for SI.com who covers basketball and football. ""People love bragging when they pick something right."" Read Mandel's analysis of the brackets . And, amid all this game monitoring and chatter, some say productivity and earnings may take a hit, but others say the shared experience bolsters business. The first week of the tournament -- when the most games are played during daytime hours -- could cost U.S. employers as much as $1.8 billion, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., a global outplacement company in Chicago, Illiniois, that annually predicts the tournament's impact. This blow to employers is based on surveys showing that 45 percent of Americans enter office pools and waste on average about 20 minutes a day focusing on basketball instead of work. Challenger, Gray & Christmas says that translates to more than 58 million employees. Print your bracket (PDF) ""Employers can no longer claim to be caught off guard by the annual event,"" firm CEO John Challenger said in a written statement. ""Some have tried to squash these pools, most simply ignore them and others have found ways to embrace the tournament as a team-building and morale-boosting opportunity."" But this figure on time and money lost seems ""plucked out of thin air,"" said Don Forsyth, a psychologist who studies group dynamics in the workplace in the Jepson School of Leadership Studies at the University of Richmond in Virginia. Who is to say how much time and money people waste each day on personal distractions, he asked. And maybe, he added, the employee who generally dreads going to work comes in energized because of the games. Forsyth, who's been studying work dynamics for 30 years, said the shared experience of feeling the madness probably does the workplace good and leads to gains instead of losses. ""It's a powerful social process,"" he said. ""It builds relationships and rituals within the group. Everyone is included,"" from the corner offices to the mailroom. ""People on the fringe get drawn in. It builds cohesion,"" he continued. ""You'd pay an expert to come in to do that for your company. March Madness does it for free.""","As March Madness begins, office pools and basketball become part of workday .

"(CNN) -- The California Highway Patrol officer who responded last week to an emergency call about a runaway Toyota Prius described the driver as visibly shaking and said he ""appeared to be in shock"" once the car came to a stop, according to the police report released Wednesday. The Prius' driver, Jim Sikes, called 911 on March 8 after he said his accelerator became stuck as he tried to pass a slower vehicle. For about 20 minutes, Sikes said, he was unable to gain control of the car as it reached speeds in excess of 90 mph on a winding, hilly portion of Interstate 8 outside of San Diego. He said he repeatedly pressing down on the brakes and trying to lift the gas pedal to no avail. In the police report, responding Officer Todd Neibert said he ""could smell the heated brakes which indicated they had been used extensively"" and said he saw the brake lights periodically illuminate as he came upon the car. When he pulled alongside the car, ""I could see the driver sat up off his seat indicating that he was possibly applying the brake pedal using his body weight."" He said the Prius slowed slightly -- down to about 85 mph -- before accelerating again to 95 mph, according to the report. ""The driver looked over at me briefly and appeared to be in a panicked state,"" Neibert's report said. Eventually, Neibert used the patrol car's public address system to instruct Sikes to apply the brakes and the emergency brake at the same time. That tactic worked, and he was able to stop the car. ""The driver ... was visibly shaking and breathing deeply,"" the report said. ""He appeared to be in shock."" Upon searching the car, Neibert found ""a large amount of brake dust and brake pad material in and around the wheels,"" the report said. Toyota technicians investigating the incident were unable to recreate the same condition, according to a draft congressional memo obtained earlier this week by CNN. In addition, Sikes' claims that he slammed on the brake while his gas pedal was stuck to the floor do ""not appear to be feasibly possible,"" the memo said. David Justo of Toyota Motor Sales headquarters, described in the memo as Toyota's residential hybrid expert, said that if the gas pedal of the car was stuck to the floor, and the driver applied the brake, the engine would shut down. The memo said before Sikes' vehicle could be tested, technicians had to replace rotors, brakes and pads, as the pads and rotors were worn down. Contacted by CNN on Sunday, Sikes said he stands by his story. He declined to comment further.","CHP officer responded last week to emergency call about runaway Toyota Prius .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Anti-government protesters poured a small amount of blood at the headquarters of the government in Bangkok on Tuesday, but the demonstration did not live up to their threat to douse the ministers' offices in blood. The protesters had launched a blood drive earlier to collect enough samples for the demonstration. Thousands of ""red shirts"" -- so named for their clothing -- held out their forearms to allow their compatriots to draw blood. The protesters intended to collect 1,000 liters (1 million cubic centimeters) and then throw the blood on the grounds of the Government House, which houses ministerial offices, at 6 p.m. (7 a.m. ET). ""Red shirts"" rally in Bangkok: Share your photos . If Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva still refuses to dissolve parliament, the demonstrators said they will collect another 1,000 liters of blood Wednesday and splash it on the headquarters of the ruling party. The next day, they will collect 1,000 more liters and target the prime minister's residence, the demonstrators said. What are the protests about? Abhisit has repeatedly said he will listen to the protesters but will not accede to their demands. The anti-government demonstrations began Friday. By Sunday, tens of thousands of protesters had poured into the center of Bangkok. The rallies have been largely peaceful. Abhisit has said his government will not use force to quell the demonstrations. The nation's tourism minister estimated the demonstrations might have resulted in a 20 percent drop in tourists. The impact on Chinese visitors appears to have been greater, with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce reporting a 50 percent cancellation rate. The protesters are supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. Thaksin was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full term and remains hugely popular. He fled the country in 2008 while facing trial on corruption charges that he says were politically motivated. The protesters say Abhisit was not democratically elected and have demanded that he call new elections. Since Thaksin's ouster, Thailand has endured widespread political unrest that has pitted Thaksin loyalists against Abhisit supporters. Two people were killed and at least 135 wounded in riots in April 2009 when protesters clashed with demonstrators supporting the government. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Dan Rivers contributed to this report .","Thousands of ""red shirts"" hold out forearms to give blood for message .

"(CNN) -- The Red River at Fargo, North Dakota, reached ""major flood stage"" early Wednesday as the National Guard and a small army of volunteers filled sandbags to keep the waters at bay. ""Everybody is just focused on battling it once again, and they're doing it with smiles on their faces,"" said Staff Sgt. Amy Wieser Willson of the North Dakota National Guard. The river rose to a record 40.8 feet at Fargo in 2009. As of about 7 a.m. Wednesday (8 a.m. ET), the river stood at 30.34 feet, 12 feet above the flood stage of 18 feet and past major flood stage. Floodwaters are forecast to peak at 38 feet this weekend. Are you there? Send photos, video to CNN iReport . ""Major flood stage"" is a term the National Weather Service uses to describe flooding causing ""extensive inundation of structures and roads"" and possibly the ""significant evacuations of people and the transfer of property to higher elevations."" ""[It's] very stressful for a lot of people, especially after seeing how much damage and how long the flood fight went on last year,"" Willson said. About 300 people were helping on the sandbag lines as the community raced to fill 1 million of them. See local coverage of the flooding . Torrey Callies spent a couple of days helping shield his Fargo neighborhood from the rising waters. ""We're making some good headway here,"" he said at midday Wednesday, as volunteers finished a sandbag dike. The sandbag levee is meant to hold back what's known locally as Meadow Creek, which branches off from the rising Wild Rice River. ""Everybody that lives here went through it last year, so everybody is well-schooled in how to do this,"" Callies said. Still, ""there's not the sense of deathly emergency that there was last year,"" he said. At least 150 volunteers -- most of them high school and college students -- helped in the neighborhood Tuesday, Callies said. ""God bless 'em for showing up, because without volunteer help, we'd never get this done,"" said Callies, 44, who owns a collection agency with his brother. ""In my book, that's a pretty cool thing to do."" The mess it makes of back muscles and backyards is worth it, he said. ""You want to keep your house dry, and that's the main thing,"" Callies said. ""The grass will grow back."" ""It's tough because it's awful work and it's hard on the back and it's stressful, but what do you do? You just suck it up and start throwing sandbags."" Last week, warm weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, causing the Red River to swell. Upstream, snow and ice have yet to melt, pushing water back toward the two cities. Meanwhile, along the Eastern Seaboard, utility crews made steady progress restoring electricity after a powerful nor'easter whipped the region over the weekend. About 125,000 customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut remained without power early Wednesday. ""We know how difficult this is for our customers, and we appreciate their patience,"" said John Miksad of Con Edison. ""With each reconnection, we focus on restoring the greatest numbers of customers possible."" The outages were due mostly to power lines downed by Saturday's hurricane-force winds, which knocked over trees and utility poles. At least seven deaths were attributed to the storm, five caused by falling trees, authorities said. CNN's Jim Kavanagh, Sean Morris and Ed Payne and CNN Radio's Michelle Wright and Richard Benson contributed to this report.","NEW: River rises 12 feet above flood stage at Fargo, North Dakota .

"(CNN) -- England soccer star John Terry has again been engulfed in controversy after his car hit a club steward on Tuesday night following Chelsea's Champions League defeat by Inter Milan. English Premier League side Chelsea confirmed that the club's captain had driven into one of its security staff as he sought to get past a horde of photographers and fans after the match, the UK Press Association reported on Wednesday. British media had widely reported that police said the man suffered a broken leg, but Chelsea told PA that he had only ""a badly bruised leg."" ""We can confirm there was an unfortunate accident as John Terry left Stamford Bridge last night,"" a Chelsea spokesman told PA. ""When driving out of the stadium at approximately 1-2 mph in a queue of traffic exiting the ground, his car was surrounded by photographers and fans. In the melee that ensued a member of Chelsea's security staff was knocked to the ground, making contact with the car. He suffered a badly bruised leg. ""John was aware at the time that there was a lot of contact with his car during the incident, but not that anyone was injured as a result. Upon hearing of the injury, John spoke to the police. He has also been in contact with the staff member to check on his welfare."" Terry's spokesman Phil Hall told Sky Sports News that the player had been breathalyzed by the police, with tests showing he had not been drinking alcohol. Hall said Terry planned to visit the steward on Thursday as he was upset about the accident. The incident was another blow for Terry, whose Chelsea team missed out on a place in the quarterfinals of Europe's premier club competition for the first time since 2006. Italian champions Inter, managed by Terry's former Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho, won 1-0 on the night thanks to a late goal by Samuel Eto'o which sealed a 3-1 aggregate victory. The 29-year-old Terry has recently been at the center of a media storm following revelations about his alleged affair with the ex-partner of his former Chelsea teammate Wayne Bridge. He was stripped of the national captaincy by coach Fabio Capello as a result. Bridge subsequently decided he would not be available for selection by England at the World Cup starting in June as he believed his presence in the dressing room with Terry would be ""divisive"" for the team. Bridge, who plays for Manchester City, is sidelined after having a hernia operation on Tuesday which will rule him out for a month. The defender, who had only just returned to action following a knee injury, aggravated a long-term problem during Sunday's 1-1 Premier League draw with Sunderland. Meanwhile, the Premier League confirmed on Wednesday that bottom club Portsmouth have been docked nine points after going into administration last month. League officials acted after Britain's tax department dropped its legal action challenging the club's change of financial status. The decision means debt-ridden Portsmouth are almost certain to be relegated, with Avram Grant's team now 17 points from safety with only nine matches left in the season. Fellow strugglers Hull City, second from bottom 14 points above Portsmouth, confirmed on Wednesday that Iain Dowie will be the Yorkshire club's new manager until the end of this season. Dowie, who replaces the sacked Phil Brown, has previously coached Charlton, Crystal Palace and Queen's Park Rangers.","England soccer star John Terry drives into a club steward on Tuesday night .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: A prestigious scholarship or a professional football career? One student athlete is trying to prove that you can have both. I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now! First Up: Jobs Bill . AZUZ: First up, a bill aimed at creating new jobs is about to become a law. A vote in the Senate put the final seal of approval on the legislation yesterday, moved it on to President Obama for his signature. The bill has gone back and forth in the House and the Senate. At $17.6 billion, it's actually a scaled-down version of a jobs bill that was put together last month. Here's some of what it includes: Tax breaks for companies that hire people who are currently unemployed. Tax breaks for businesses that spend money on major investments or purchases. And funding for highway and transit programs this year. Some experts say the bill could create 300,000 new jobs. Others say it doesn't guarantee that companies will start hiring, and some lawmakers have argued that the bill doesn't do nearly enough. Rising Waters . AZUZ: In parts of the midwestern United States, National Guard members and local volunteers are fighting to keep the Red River at bay. A lot of these volunteers are high school and college students who are spending their spring breaks filling and stacking sandbags. The river's waters are on the rise thanks to melting snow, and there's a threat of serious flooding. This same thing happened last year when the Red River hit a record level in Fargo, North Dakota. Rob Marciano has more on the impact of the severe weather then and now. (BEGIN VIDEO) ROB MARCIANO, CNN METEOROLOGIST: In Fargo, North Dakota, residents are trying to stack one million sandbags in hopes of pushing back the Red River, which could crest 20 feet above flood stage later this week. Last year, about 100 homes in the area were damaged and thousands of people were evacuated when the Red didn't go down for a record 61 days and crested twice. In the Northeast, a wild storm has left hundreds of thousands of residents either without power or with most of what they own underwater. Trees ripped down power lines, tore up sidewalks and crushed cars. The storm is being blamed for at least seven deaths. Many had to leave their front doors by boat or in the arms of heavy equipment. (END VIDEO) I.D. Me . RICK VINCENT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a U.S. city that was founded in 1701. I'm known as the Motor City because of my connection to the auto industry. I'm not the capital of Michigan, but I am the largest city in the state. I'm Detroit, and I'm home to about 4 million people. Closing . AZUZ: In three months, more than 40 Detroit schools will be closed. It's part of a $1 billion plan that was announced yesterday. The Detroit School District is looking for ways to cut costs. Officials say this plan will save $31 million in 2010 and help save money in the future. At a meeting to announce the proposal, Robert Bobb, the Emergency Financial Manager for Detroit Public Schools, said it will create a ""leaner, smarter"" school system. Detroit is dealing with buildings and facilities that are getting older. Plus, student enrollment in the district has dropped significantly; there are 50,000 empty seats. Community members will get a chance to offer feedback at a series of town hall meetings. But yesterday, Mr. Bobb outlined the long-term goals for the district. ROBERT BOBB, EMERGENCY FINANCIAL MANAGER, DETROIT PUBLIC SCHOOLS: We believe that this plan provides certainty where, in the minds of some, there may be uncertainty. We want to build flexible, adaptable and sustainable learning environments. We want to support smaller learning environments. Want to develop multi-use facilities that support community use and community partnerships. U.S. Relations . AZUZ: Last weekend, the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. reportedly said the relationship between the two countries was the worst it's been in 35 years. We told you about that. Now, though, he says he never said that. There has been some tension between the countries recently, but the Israeli ambassador says ""recent events do not represent the lowest point in the relations between Israel and the United States."" He added that the nations disagree on some issues, but says he's confident the differences will soon be overcome. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had some harsh words for Israel recently. But on Tuesday, she called the bond between the countries ""unshakable,"" although she added that the U.S. is still waiting for Israel's response on proving that the Middle Eastern country is serious about a Middle East peace plan.

O'BRIEN: From the moment he first touched a football, Myron Rolle was a star. ROLLE: I was pretty good at it. I was bigger than all the kids, so I had some success. O'BRIEN: In high school, ESPN ranked Myron the number one senior football player in the country. Eighty-three colleges made him an offer. Myron chose Florida State University, a prime launching pad for the pros. Myron played safety. His future: a shoo-in, first-round pick in the NFL draft last year, millions of dollars to follow. But that's when he basically quit, when he put it all at risk. Why did you leave? Why did you quit football? ROLLE: I left football because the Rhodes Scholarship was too great to pass up. It was either now or never. O'BRIEN: He won a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship, a chance to earn a Masters Degree in medical anthropology at Oxford University in England. Myron moved to England and watched the NFL draft from the sidelines. ROLLE: It hurt. It really did. It pained me. Like inside, deep. I said, I can be out there right now making millions of dollars. That could be my name being called. But when I went to Oxford, I said, this is the right choice. O'BRIEN: He's not done with his studies. He has more to do at Oxford. But now, nearly a year later, with that certainty of his, Myron Rolle came back. After a few years in the pros, he wants to go to med school to become a neurosurgeon. He's got to get back to England to finish his degree. ROLLE: This is the mud from England right here. O'BRIEN: Make no mistake, here, no one cares about Oxford. This is business, high stakes football. Is this guy as good as he was a year ago? And now, game on. Myron played well in the Senior Bowl. The NFL draft is weeks away. It's pressure. ROLLE: Sometimes it's overwhelming. Sometimes you have to take a step back. O'BRIEN: So many people counting on him. ROLLE: You know what RS stands for? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's that?

"(CNN)  -- From a small apartment in Toronto, Iranian exile Saeed Valadbaygi is trying to bring news from his country to the world. Using a network of Iranian journalists and eager volunteers back in Tehran, the 27-year-old former student collates reports, pictures and video for his Web site astreetjournalist.com. Having fled Iran following the June demonstrations, Valadbaygi set up the site in November -- his latest attempt to beat what he says are government hackers and offer news and views about the unrest in Iran. With international media operating under restrictions in Iran, independent journalists using blogs and social networking sites have become an important source of information. ""What's happening in Iran is not being reflected globally. We want to let the world know and let the state know that the world is watching,"" said Valadbaygi. During the deadly street demonstrations in Tehran on December 27, Valadbaygi said his web site had 17 million hits in two days. The site, which is maintained by about 12 volunteers, wobbled and slowed down, but stayed up and running. ""We've already experienced a large number of viewers on our blogs and web sites and therefore we have been hacked by the regime of Iran repeatedly and unfortunately have lost access to many of our web sites. But introducing this web site (to) professional colleagues and also lots of viewers who are currently collaborating with us has helped in achieving wonderful results in the past few days."" Valadbaygi believes in the power of social media. He is active on Facebook and Twitter and maintains a blog called Revolutionary Road. ""Facebook and Twitter have turned into a strong tool for people in spreading news. Citizen journalists have the most effect on news and today we clearly see that each citizen in Iran is acting as a media. Therefore we have the responsibility in gathering the news in one place to achieve a better result against the regime's censorship,"" he said. Valadbaygi, who says he was expelled in 2008 from Amirkabir University in Tehran because of his political views, took part in the June protests and distributed underground newspapers as an independent demonstrator, rather than a supporter of opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Four suspected drug cartel members have been arrested in connection with the slaying of a family in what authorities call an act of revenge for the death of a drug baron, a state attorney general said Wednesday. The shootings early Tuesday that led to the deaths of four family members of 3rd Petty Officer Melquisedet Angulo Cordova was an act of revenge carried out by Los Zetas, a drug cartel allied with the Beltran Leyva cartel, said Rafael Gonzalez Lastra, attorney general for the southern Mexican state of Tabasco. The suspects were arrested Tuesday night, he said. Cordova was killed in the December 16 shootout that resulted in the death of Arturo Beltran Leyva, nicknamed the ""boss of bosses,"" during a raid by a Mexican navy contingent at an upscale resort condo in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Angulo Cordova was hailed as a hero by President Felipe Calderon and laid to rest in his home state of Tabasco. Early Tuesday, gunmen entered the family's home and opened fire, killing Angulo Cordova's mother, sister and aunt. Angulo Cordova's brother was injured in the shooting and later died in a hospital. The Zetas, the protection arm of the Gulf cartel that also operates as its own trafficking organization, carried out revenge killings because of an alliance between them and the Beltran Leyva group, Gonzalez Lastra said. Two of the arrested cartel members were responsible for the payments for the killings, and two acted as lookouts during the incident, he said. The suspects were identified as Julio Acosta Saucedo, Yesenia Hernandez Valencia, Azael Jesus Garcia Reyes and Julio Acosta Vargas. Gonzalez Lastra said authorities know the identities of the shooters as well as the vehicles used in the attack. Some local police officers were also involved, he said.","NEW: Two of the arrested were responsible for payout; two acted as lookouts, official says .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)  -- Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab disappeared in Yemen for more than two months before he allegedly tried to bring down a Northwest Airlines jet with explosives concealed in his underwear. Investigators want to know if, during that time, he heeded the call to prayer coming from the hills above Yemen's capital, where an Islamic university headed by a fiery cleric has helped the country earn its reputation as an incubator of extremism. The students who pray at Al-Iman University now, two weeks after that failed Christmas Day attack, say the school has been made a scapegoat, and that what AbdulMutallab is accused of having done is wrong. ""It's against Islam,"" one says. ""The thoughts in their heads go against Islam,"" says another. AbdulMutallab's alleged attempt to ignite explosives as the jet approached Detroit, Michigan, resulted in a fire on his lap -- and serious burns -- before passengers and flight crew subdued him and put out the flames. Al-Imam's leader is Sheikh Abdel Majid al-Zindani, a provocative cleric with a flaming red beard. The United States considers him a terrorist, accused in 2004 of supplying weapons to al Qaeda. But in Yemen, al-Zindani is a free and influential man. Al-Zindani denied CNN's request for an interview but allowed the network to tape at the school he's built from the ground up since the early 1990s. Every year, thousands of Islamic students from Yemen, Africa and around the world are cocooned in al-Zindani's compound, where they study their faith and are instilled with a strident defense of that faith. Last year, al-Zindani made a public plea to recruit millions of young men to fight jihad against Israel. But the students say they don't think AbdulMutallab was ever at the school, and investigators don't appear to have come to ask. Yemeni authorities, it seems, have taken a hands-off approach to the university. ""To my knowledge, no security, no investigation teams came here,"" political science professor Ismail al-Suhaili said. ""Nobody thought that AbdulMutallab was here."" In Yemen, Al-Iman University is highly respected and its leader admired, making it difficult for investigators to find out for sure if the Christmas Day bombing suspect was ever there.","Officials want to know if attack attempt suspect visited Al-Iman University .

"Rome, Italy (CNN)  -- ""The devil tempts everyone -- people in politics, in economics, in sport. And naturally, he tempts, above all, the religious leaders, so you shouldn't be surprised if the devil tempts those in the Vatican. That's his job."" Father Gabriele Amorth isn't speaking metaphorically when he says that. The 85-year-old priest means people can be tempted and literally possessed by Satan. ""It's not my opinion: I'm saying that if you believe in the Gospels, you believe in the existence of the devil, in the devil's power to possess people,"" he said in an interview with CNN. The faithful believe ""that there are people possessed by the devil, and ... in the power of exorcism to liberate from the devil,"" he said. And as the chief exorcist of the Roman Catholic Church, it's his job to expel the devil when someone is possessed. Amorth, the founder of the International Association of Exorcists, has performed more than 70,000 exorcisms in his career, he estimates. But there is a difference between possession -- where the devil takes hold of someone's body and actions -- and temptation, where Satan lures a person into doing evil, he said. As a child abuse scandal sweeps across Europe, with accusations being made against priests in Ireland, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, Amorth said the pedophiles are tempted, not possessed. He has never done an exorcism on a child molester, he said. ""I have carried out exorcisms on some priests who had been molested by the devil,"" he said, without going into details. ""But cases of pedophilia exorcised, no. ... Pedophiles are not possessed by the devil, they are tempted by the devil,"" he said. ""They don't need exorcism, they need to be converted, to be converted to God, that's what they need. They need to confess, they need true penitence, true repentance, that's what they need. They're not possessed."" But no one is too strong a believer to be possessed, said Amorth, who is employed by the Roman diocese. ""Nothing occurs without the permission of God, and he allows even holy people, even saints, to be possessed by the devil,"" he said. But, he added, he sees no evil in the Vatican today: ""I just see good people in the Vatican. People of prayer, holy people, I don't see any evil.""","Father Gabriele Amorth is chief exorcist at Vatican; he claims over 70,000 exorcisms .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama is expected on Monday to meet with the Shanghai mayor and hold a town hall-style meeting with ""future Chinese leaders"" before heading to Beijing to meet his host, Chinese President Hu Jintao. Trade issues are likely to be a major discussion topic between the two leaders; the United States imports billions of dollars in Chinese products each year. At local markets, Chinese government officials banned a popular Obama shirt over fears that it would offend their guest. It depicts Obama wearing a Chinese Communist outfit made famous by Mao Zedong, the late Communist leader. The back has ""Oba-Mao"" printed on it. Obama's visit comes as China relishes its spot as a key global player. It is involved in major international disputes such as the showdowns with Iran and North Korea and has used its position on the U.N. Security Council and its economic leverage to influence events around the globe. China also is now the dominant regional player in northeast Asia, recently hosting a summit in Beijing with the Japanese and South Korean leaders. The nation's economic expansion has led to a demand for raw materials around the world and the rapid expansion of China's presence in countries such as Guinea, Myanmar, Sudan and Venezuela. Human rights groups say China is propping up repressive regimes to secure its access to critically important raw materials. China's rapid economic expansion outpaces growth in the United States, 8.9 percent in the past quarter versus 3.5 percent in the United States, giving Beijing huge economic leverage. Obama's half-brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo lives in Shenzhen in southern China. Ndesandjo, an engineer by trade, moved from the United States after losing his job seven years ago. Ndesandjo took the last name of the man his mother remarried and has dodged the media since Obama was elected president. He spoke to reporters about his semi-autobiographical book, ""Nairobi to Shenzhen,"" earlier this month. He said their father was abusive and beat him and his mother. Ndesandjo owns a small chain of restaurants in Shenzhen and teaches piano to orphans. The White House did not say whether the president would see him during his trip. The final stop of his Asia trek is Seoul, where Obama will meet with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and deliver a speech to American troops at Osan Air Base. Obama is on an eight-day journey that has also taken him to Japan and Singapore, where he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic forum. He'll return to the United States on Friday.","In Shanghai Obama will hold town hall-style meeting with ""future Chinese leaders""

"(CNN) -- Arsenal moved to within three points of leaders Chelsea at the top of the English Premier League after Cesc Fabregas inspired them to a 2-0 victory at Bolton to spoil new manager Owen Coyle's first match in charge. Captain Fabregas produced an impressive display on his return from a hamstring injury and scored his 10th league goal of the season in the 28th minute after a neat one-two with Eduardo. His surging run then led to substitute and fellow-Spaniard Fran Merida scoring the second 12 minutes from time as former Wanderers player Coyle's reign at the Reebok Stadium got off to a losing start. With these two teams due to meet in the return fixture at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday, Arsene Wenger's side could well take over at the top of the table in the next few days. Bolton remain second from bottom, with Coyle having swapped one relegation battle with Burnley for another. Earlier in the day, Blackburn captain Ryan Nelsen put the seal on his side's long-awaited return to winning ways as they overcame Fulham 2-0 at Ewood Park. Nelsen applied the finish to Benni McCarthy's 54th-minute free-kick to put Rovers within touching distance of their first three-point haul since November. Defender Chris Samba had earlier settled the home side's nerves with a fortuitous 24th-minute opener after he ricocheted home an attempted clearance by former Blackburn winger Damien Duff. In the day's other match, Aston Villa failed to cash in on slip-ups by their Champions League-chasing rivals after being held 0-0 at home by West Ham. Villa could have closed the gap on the top four after Manchester City, beaten at Everton, and Tottenham, held at home by Hull, both dropped points on Saturday. But a combination of a below-par performance and some fine saves by Robert Green meant they had to settle for their first goalless draw of the league campaign.","Arsenal move to within three points of Chelsea at the top of the English Premier League .

"L'AQUILA, Italy (CNN) -- Rescuers worked into the early morning hours Tuesday in hopes of finding survivors of a powerful earthquake that ripped through Italy's mountainous Abruzzo region, killing scores of people and leaving tens of thousands homeless. People cue in line to receive aid in L'Aqulia following Monday's earthquake. Tearful survivors, many of them clad in pajamas and blankets, watched as bodies were pulled from the rubble in the medieval city of L'Aquila, about 120 km (75 miles) northeast of Rome. The quake killed more than 150 people, L'Aquila's fire department said late Monday. Nearly 24 hours after the quake hit, authorities were still unsure how many people remained trapped in the wreckage. ""We think maybe 70 to 100,"" said Francesco Rocca, a spokesman for the Italian Red Cross. ""We still don't know the exact number. This is why we are still working very, very hard at the moment."" Another body was found in the rubble of a student dormitory early Tuesday morning, and at least five other students were believed inside. But aftershocks hindered rescuers early Tuesday, and they have asked for additional equipment and expertise from Rome, authorities at the scene told CNN. Italy's Civil Protection agency reported at least 1,500 injured and 50,000 without shelter. ""I can say there's hardly a building which was left without some sign of what has happened in the historical center of L'Aquila,"" Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said during a visit to the stricken region. ""All the public buildings have been affected."" Berlusconi said 4,000 people were working on the rescue effort. Civil defense officials said they are prepared to house up to 30,000 people, but many of those displaced have gone to hotels. Of the 150 dead, about 100 bodies have been identified, the officials said. Monday's earthquake was about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) deep, the USGS said. About 10:20 p.m. (8:20 p.m. GMT) Sunday, a 4.6-magnitude earthquake hit northern Italy, about 55 km (35 miles) southeast of Bologna, the agency said. That earthquake's depth was 6.4 km (4 miles). The quake is the deadliest to strike Italy in decades, and the first major temblor to strike the country in almost seven years. Joshua Brothers, an American missionary, told CNN that the quake ""sounded as if a 747 (jet) was actually coming in to land."" ""That was the first thing that was on my mind,"" he said. The quake left stone buildings in heaps, with rubble spilling over parked cars and into alleyways. Frightened residents rushed into the streets, many of them bringing luggage with them, Brothers said.  See images of the destruction » .

"(CNN) -- The H1N1 virus has now become the dominant influenza virus around the globe, with high levels and an increase of activity in many regions, the World Health Organization said Thursday. In a weekly update, the WHO's point person on the H1N1 virus, Dr. Keiji Fukuda, also warned the public not to treat the virus like just another flu. Like seasonal flu, H1N1 is more active in the winter than in the summer, and a majority of infected people get better on their own, Fukuda said. H1N1 also is as transmissible and infectious as seasonal flu, he said. But unusually for influenza, Fukuda said, H1N1 continues at high levels over the summer months, and many of the serious illnesses and deaths are concentrated in people younger than 65. Seven months into the pandemic, the virus commonly known as swine flu remains at high levels and continues to increase in North America, Fukuda said. Mexico, for example, has seen more cases from September to November than they saw in the preceding months from April, when the virus emerged, he said. The virus is also becoming more active in Europe and Central and Western Asia, Fukuda said. Health officials this week reported an outbreak of cases in Ukraine, which now has more than 250,000 cases of influenza-like illness, with 235 patients requiring intensive care, the WHO said. Activity is picking up in East Asia, Fukuda said. Mongolia reported ""a number"" of cases over the past week, he said. ""East Asia is one of the parts of the world where seasonal influenza viruses have remained in reasonably high circulation,"" Fukuda said. ""But even in that part of the world, the pandemic virus is becoming dominant."" More cases are being reported from a number of Caribbean countries such as Cuba and Haiti, he said. In Central America and the Southern Hemisphere, however, activity levels have dropped as those regions enter the summer season, Fukuda said. ""There are several regions in the world -- North America, Europe, Northern and Central Asia -- where we are clearly seeing pandemic influenza activity increase,"" he said, but ""there is no one single place in the world where we are focused on."" Disease activity has been difficult to predict, Fukuda said. ""We really are not going to know what the future is going to bring, and so the main focus of our effort here is ... what steps are needed to make sure countries are as prepared as possible to deal with disease levels,"" he said. H1N1 poses different challenges in different countries, but it does seem to be affecting indigenous groups more heavily than nonindigenous groups, he said. In Australia, for example, ""aboriginal groups are disproportionately represented in people who end up in hospitals from diseases related to the pandemic,"" Fukuda said. The WHO still doesn't know whether the effect on indigenous groups is because of the pandemic itself or because of underlying factors. Because most people infected with swine flu tend to recover on their own and don't suffer major problems afterwards, some people are tempted to dismiss the infection and think it's not serious. But Fukuda said that's a dangerous mind-set. ""At WHO, we remain quite concerned about the patterns we are seeing, particularly because a sizable number of people develop complications [that lead to death],"" he said. ""We do see that the serious complications are concentrated in the younger age groups rather than the older age groups."" While the complications are most often seen in people who have chronic, underlying health conditions and in pregnant women, they also can develop in people ""who are currently healthy and young."" But contrary to some reports, Fukuda said, the WHO has not seen big mutations in the virus since it first emerged. He said viruses being isolated now are ""generally similar"" to those isolated over the past several months, indicating they haven't changed much. The WHO also has no evidence of widespread resistance to antiviral medication, Fukuda said. There have been sporadic instances of resistance to oseltamivir -- the generic name for Tamiflu, one of the main drugs used against influenza -- but such cases are still ""isolated and infrequent,"" he said. ""Antivirals are quite useful against these infections,"" he said. Fukuda praised as ""innovative"" the decision by Norway to distribute antiviral medication over the counter for a limited period of time. The move can help take stress off the primary health system and allow patients to get the medicine more quickly, he said. Other useful protections against H1N1 are vaccines, which the WHO recommends against pandemic infections, Fukuda said. ""These vaccines now have been used in a significant number of countries ... and based on this experience, in which millions of people have now received vaccine, we in fact see that these vaccines are very safe,"" he said. The only side effects are swelling and pain at the injection site, but ""these are occurring at rates that are expected and usually seen with seasonal influenza vaccine,"" Fukuda said. ""WHO, along with other public health authorities, believes that these vaccines are very useful against pandemic infections and [we] do support their use,"" he said.","H1N1 continues at high levels over the summer months, unlike seasonal flu .

"New York (CNN) -- When the New York Jets face the Cincinnati Bengals Sunday for what may be the final football game played at Giants Stadium, fans in attendance won't be able to drown their sorrows or toast a victory. The Jets have banned the sale of alcohol on Sunday at the stadium they've called home for 26 years. ""With the late start of Sunday's game, coupled with this being the final regular season and final game at the stadium, we feel it is prudent not to serve alcohol,"" said Bruce Speight, a spokesman for the team. The Jets approach the decision of whether to serve alcohol on a game-by-game basis, Speight said. Fresh off a victory over the formerly undefeated Indianapolis Colts, the Jets are on the verge of their first play-off berth in three years -- and fans are riled up and ready to go. And Jets fans are known for rowdy behavior -- for example, a half-time ""tradition"" of women baring their breasts for men who loudly urge them to do so. In lieu of alcohol, the Jets said, they'll pass out green and white ""rowdy towels"" to the first 70,000 fans arriving at the stadium. But the ban has raised the ire of a New Jersey vodka distillery. Majorska Vodka, which calls itself ""one of the largest liquor companies in the Garden State,"" is calling for a 24-hour boycott of Johnson & Johnson products because, according to company spokesman Jeff Scott, Jets owner Woody Johnson is the ""heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune."" Scott said Majorska plans to stop paying for three of their executive's seats at the Meadowlands and that the company is set to lose more than $100,000 in revenue from tailgate parties this weekend. The New York Jets officially declined to comment, but team spokesman Speight said that ""negative fan reaction has been minimal at best"" and pointed out that vodka is not sold anywhere in the stadium and the ban does not apply to tailgating. But Martin Silver, Majorska's president and CEO, said fans are shocked and outraged that the Jets are treating their supporters ""like children."" Silver, a life-long Jets backer with a Joe Namath jersey hanging in his office, is directing his frustration at the team's ownership because he feels they are ""controlling the game completely."" He said his company is distributing anti-Johnson & Johnson petitions Friday to 350 sports bars across New Jersey. ""We're taking this on, right to the top, to Johnson,"" said Silver. Woody Johnson is the grandson of Johnson & Johnson founder Robert Wood Johnson, but is not currently connected to the company. William C. Weldon is the company's chairman and CEO. None of the Johnson family serves on the company's management team or board of directors. Johnson & Johnson spokesman Bill Price said that ""officially we have no comment given that the Johnson family has had no managerial role with the company for decades."" Giants Stadium, part of the Meadowlands Sports complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, has been home to both the Jets and the New York Giants, who played their first game there on October 10, 1976. Early on during their tenancy at Giants Stadium, the Jets refered to the 82,000-seat arena simply as ""the Meadowlands"" although in recent years Jets tickets have used the facility's official name. The stadium, which has hosted popes, concerts and major league soccer as well as football, is to be demolished after this season. Both New York teams will move into a new stadium just a short distance away next season. That stadium will get its name from a corporate sponsor, yet to be named.

"(CNN)  -- Hours after a security breach forced the closure of a terminal at the Newark, New Jersey, airport Sunday, authorities were still searching for a man who went the wrong way through a checkpoint exit. The incident happened at about 5:20 p.m. at Terminal C, when an individual walked from the public side to the secure ""sterile"" side for passengers who had cleared screening, according to the Transportation Security Administration. No flights were allowed to leave from Terminal C Sunday evening and thousands of other travelers who had reached the sterile area after going through checkpoints were moved back to the public area to be re-screened, the TSA said. Authorities are reviewing video from airport cameras. They are not sure whether the man was once on the sterile side and went back, or if he never went through screening, TSA spokeswoman Anne Davis said. Watch more about the situation in Newark .

"MERRICK, New York (CNN) -- ""This is a healthy 9-year-old boy. How in the world could his heart just stop?"" Robbie Levine died at age 9 after running the bases at a Little League game. Standing in the emergency room the night of September 27, 2005, that's the question Jill Levine kept asking herself. She'd just gotten news that she found impossible to comprehend: Her eldest son, Robbie, a fourth grader, had died. About an hour earlier, Robbie had been running the bases at Little League practice near their home in Merrick, a suburb of New York City. Levine's husband, Craig, who coached the team, was standing at first base when Robbie ran by him. ""I remember thinking I'd never seen him run so fast,"" he recalled. But seconds later, he turned to see that his son had collapsed right on home plate. Craig Levine ran to Robbie's side, realized that Robbie didn't have a pulse and began administering CPR. Several minutes passed before an ambulance arrived. Robbie was pronounced dead at the hospital. With two other young children, Jill Levine says she didn't give herself the option to become paralyzed with grief after her tragic loss. Instead, she took action. ""I knew that [Robbie] could have had a chance if there was a defibrillator,"" she says. So for the past 2½ years, Levine has dedicated herself to raising awareness about the need for these cardiac devices in youth sports, which she does through her Robbie Levine Foundation, co-founded with her husband. Automated external defibrillators -- also known as AEDs -- administer electrical shocks that can restore a heart to its normal rhythm. When used in conjunction with CPR, these machines can make the difference between life and death. The American Heart Association reports that after sudden cardiac arrest, every minute without CPR and defibrillation reduces survival by 7-10 percent. More than 165,000 adults die from sudden cardiac arrest each year, according to the heart association. While statistics aren't kept regarding the number of children who experience such incidents, some states have laws requiring defibrillators in schools. Yet Levine believes that if an incident occurs on a playing field, even having a defibrillator in a nearby school building might not be enough. ""Literally every minute counts,"" she stresses. ""When you're out using a field, it's too far away.""  Watch Levine recall the personal tragedy that motivated her to take action » . Through her foundation, Levine works to convince youth sports leagues to buy defibrillators and get people trained to operate them. She spends her days sending out an educational DVD produced by her foundation and talking to parents and coaches. Since defibrillators cost between $1,200 and $1,600, her foundation often donates one to a league that commits to starting a program. But even so, Levine often encounters resistance. ""The biggest obstacles that we face are people's fears,"" she says. ""But I just keep repeating over and over again: 'If it's not there, it can't help.' ""  Watch Levine and her husband describe some misperceptions about defibrillators » . Levine's goal is to make defibrillators mandatory safety equipment for youth sports, like a batting helmet in baseball. To date, she has raised approximately $200,000 and has helped put more than 100 defibrillators on playing fields around the country.  Watch Levine explain some ways to help keep young athletes safe » . For Levine, keeping other kids safe is the best way to honor Robbie. ""This horrific thing happened to us,"" she says.

"(CNN) -- Air travel security is being increased as authorities continue to question how a man got explosives on a U.S.-bound passenger jet, according to federal officials, including the president and his homeland security chief. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Monday that officials would review how anti-terrorist watch lists are maintained. Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who is accused of trying to blow up a flight carrying 300 passengers, was on a general list that contained 550,000 other names, but he was still allowed to travel to the United States. A senior administration official said the suspect was not on a no-fly list because ""the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no-fly list."" ""Under the existing protocols, it requires an interagency process and the identification of other negative information that's credible ... and that process whittles down from 500,000 [names] or so that are on the generic list to the fewer than 5,000 that are on the no-fly list,"" Napolitano said. ""We are going to be looking at that process and how those lists are created, maintained, updated, exchanged and the like, because clearly this individual should not have been able to board this plane carrying that material."" AbdulMutallab is accused of trying to blow up a Northwest flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day. Officials say he carried an explosive device that contained pentaerythritol tetranitrate, an explosive also known as PETN. Part of the device, which failed to detonate, was sewn into his underwear, a law enforcement official said Monday. President Obama, in his first public comment since the incident, said Monday that screening and security procedures for all flights were immediately enhanced, including an increase in the number of air marshals on international flights. The federal system for tracking potential terrorism suspects will be reviewed because the latest incident showed that it had possible failings, the president said. All screening policies, technologies and procedures for air travel will be reviewed ""to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks,"" Obama said. A Department of Homeland Security official who asked not to be identified said Sunday that the ranks of the air marshals have been increased by cutting vacations and leave, and by pulling in marshals from instructional and administrative posts. On CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, Napolitano said air marshals are assigned randomly to flights. Current and former marshals contacted by CNN took exception to Napolitano's claims, saying that although there is an element of randomness to increase unpredictability, the assignments of air marshals are largely based on intelligence and an analysis of which flights are most vulnerable or most attractive to terrorists. Despite a possible tragedy, Napolitano said the response system worked, as passengers and crew avoided panic and subdued the suspect while authorities notified other flights in the air of the situation and kept the air transport system operating. ""Once the incident happened, we were able to immediately notify the 128 flights in the air, as well as airports on the ground domestically, internationally, our law enforcement partners, other allies, institute immediate safe procedures to make sure that this could not happen on other flights and that people were watching out for it on other flights, even as we focused on what went wrong prior to this one,"" Napolitano added Monday. The Transportation Security Administration invoked a ""one hour rule"" after the thwarted attack, which prohibited passengers on international U.S.-bound flights from leaving their seats during the last hour of a flight, sources said. In addition, passengers had to stow pillows and blankets, and maps viewed on in-flight entertainment screens were disabled during the final hour of flight. The TSA has modified the rule, however, giving airlines and crews discretion over implementation, sources said. CNN's Erin McLaughlin and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","NEW: Screening procedures enhanced; more marshals put aboard .

"(CNN) -- Jupiter is sporting a new scar after an unseen object hit the gaseous planet this week, NASA scientists say. This NASA image shows a large impact near Jupiter's southern pole. An amateur astronomer in Australia noticed the new mark -- seen through telescopes as a dark spot -- on the planet early Monday and tipped off scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, who then confirmed it was the result of a new impact, NASA said. It's not clear what the object was that crashed into Jupiter's poisonous atmosphere. Glenn Orton, a JPL scientist, told the magazine New Scientist that it could have been a block of ice from somewhere in Jupiter's neighborhood, or a wandering comet that was too faint for astronomers to have detected before impact. The object created a mark on Jupiter that has the about same diameter as Earth, though the object itself was probably only 50 to 100 miles across, said Anthony Wesley, the amateur astronomer who first noticed the scar. The mystery object was likely moving at speeds of about 50 to 100 kilometers (31 to 62 miles) per second when it struck near Jupiter's south pole, Wesley told CNN. ""That generates an unbelievable amount of energy when it collides with pretty much anything, but especially with something the size of Jupiter,"" he said. It is only the second time scientists have been able to observe the results of such an impact on Jupiter. The first happened 15 years ago, when comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke into 21 pieces and hit the planet's atmosphere. ""Given the rarity of these events, it's extremely exciting to be involved in these observations,"" JPL astronomer Leigh Fletcher said in a NASA interview. Thermal images taken by NASA show the scar as a bright spot, which means the crash warmed the lower atmosphere in that area, New Scientist said. Researchers also found hints of higher-than-normal amounts of ammonia in the upper atmosphere. The Shoemaker-Levy comet also churned up extra ammonia, the magazine said. Jupiter's new spot isn't likely to last long -- probably just one to two weeks, Wesley said. He pointed out the impact scars from the Shoemaker-Levy debris lasted only two to three weeks before disappearing. Seeing an Earth-sized spot appear so tiny on Jupiter's surface led to some to wonder Tuesday whether our planet might be in danger of a similar collision. But Wesley said that shouldn't be a concern because Jupiter functions almost like a celestial vacuum cleaner, sucking up any objects that would be of danger to Earth and its neighbors. ""Jupiter is doing a very good job in scooping up a lot of this material that's still floating around in the solar system,"" he said. ""It's just got so much gravity as it swings around the outer part of the solar system, it can really pull in and swallow up many of the cometary objects and debris left over from the formation of the solar system. ""So it's doing a good job in keeping us safe by cleaning out a lot of these bits and pieces."" Jupiter is the fifth planet from the sun and the largest in our solar system. Its colorful atmosphere is 86 percent hydrogen and 14 percent helium, with tiny amounts of methane, ammonia, phosphine, water, acetylene, ethane, germanium, and carbon monoxide. The chemicals are responsible for producing the different colors of Jupiter's clouds. The temperature at the top of those clouds is about 230 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (145 degrees below zero Celsius), but it is far hotter near the planet's center. The core temperature may be about 43,000 degrees Fahrenheit (24,000 degrees Celsius), hotter than the surface of the sun. The most outstanding feature on Jupiter's surface is the Great Red Spot, a storm of gas that swirls at a speed of about 225 miles (360 kilometers) per hour at its edge. The spot -- which has been shrinking -- has a diameter equal to about three times that of Earth.","Amateur astronomer spots new mark on solar system's largest planet .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Even in the midst of Japan's deepest economic recession since World War II, the country's love hotel industry is thriving. The Style A hotel in Tokyo offers amenities. ""I'd hate to use the term ""recession-proof,"" but it's certainly proven very resilient over the last six to nine months,"" said Steve Mansfield, CEO of New Perspectives, which operates six love, or ""leisure,"" hotels in Japan. One of them, the Bonita Hotel in Isawa, boasts a 257 percent occupancy rate. Rooms can be rented for three to 24 hours. Mansfield's company estimates the industry in Japan pulls in $40 billion a year in revenue. ""It's a natural human desire. Even these days, on the weekend, every love hotel is full of people -- it's hard to get in. You can never stop sexual desire,"" said a woman with her boyfriend in Tokyo, who laughed in embarrassment when asked for her name. Love hotels fill a need for privacy in a country where high population density often means couples have little time alone. Rooms offer a broad assortment of features, including karaoke machines, PlayStation game consoles, DVD players, a variety of cosmetics, customized condoms and indoor-outdoor Jacuzzis.  Watch Morgan Neill's report from inside a love hotel » . Though required by law to have a front desk, most can be rented and entered without talking to a clerk. The days of Japanese being ashamed to enter love hotels are coming to an end, though, Mansfield said. ""Seventy-five percent of our guests are members of our points program,"" he said. ""They carry our points cards, they collect points and they receive gifts. That's something people are very comfortable with, and I think that reflects the customers that we attract."" Takashi Yamamoto, who designs love hotels in Tokyo, agreed. ""The bad image that love hotels had has faded over time. Also, customers started to raise their voices and became more selective about choosing hotels. In response, management has improved."" The flashiest love hotels are found in Osaka, including a Hello Kitty-themed hotel and one with a room featuring a merry-go-round. Tokyo hotels tend to be tamer, focused on winning customers with amenities. The Style A Hotel, for example, offers a suite for $190 that includes a full-size Jacuzzi and a private sauna. Though young couples make up the majority of customers, they are not the only ones. One man, who declined to be named, said: ""I go to love hotels when I'm drunk and don't feel like going home."" Whatever the reasons, the hotels have been doing well enough that Mansfield recently went to London, seeking investors to expand. ""The industry has 25,000 hotels, and through our research we've worked out that 90 percent of owners have five or fewer hotels,"" he said. That fragmentation is a structural inefficiency in the market, he said, one he would like to help correct.","Industry has 25,000 hotels, says Steve Mansfield, CEO of a love hotel operator .

"Bartow, Florida (CNN) -- After more than three decades in prison, a man in Florida was set free Thursday after a DNA test showed he did not kidnap and rape a 9-year-old boy in 1974. James Bain, 54, was 19 when he was convicted on charges of kidnapping, burglary and strong-arm rape. Now he will be allowed to go home for the first time in 35 years. ""Mr. Bain, you are a free man,"" the judge said in a Bartow, Florida, courtroom. Bain was serving a life sentence. Bain's mother, who has been in and out of hospitals in recent years, said that her son's exoneration is ""hard to believe."" ""He was just a child when he went in there,"" Sarah Reed told CNN. ""I've been trying to hold on. I've had things wrong with me, and I was afraid I wouldn't be here when he got out."" Of the 245 people in the United States who have been exonerated by DNA testing, none has spent more time behind bars than Bain, according to the Innocence Project, a national organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted people through DNA testing. ""I thanked the Lord. He must have did it for a reason,"" Reed said. ""The Lord has a reason for putting him in here, and he has a reason for keeping me around for me to see this."" Melissa Montle, an attorney with the Innocence Project, called Bain last week at his prison in Okeechobee, Florida, to tell him the news. ""I told him and he got very quiet,"" she told CNN. Then he said, ""I'm really happy,"" and began to choke up, she said. ""He's been so worried about his mom. He wants to be home to take care of her,"" Montle said. Bain was convicted in 1974 of taking a 9-year-old Lake Wales, Florida, boy from his bed and raping him. According to police records, the victim told police that he fell asleep with his brothers and sisters, but when he woke up a man was dragging him by a baseball field. The boy said he was forced to the ground and raped. The Lake Wales police report says that the boy told police that his attacker had bushy sideburns and a mustache. After being shown five photographs of potential suspects, the report says, the victim picked out the photo of Bain. That 9-year-old boy, now 44, still lives in Florida and has been made aware of the situation, according to multiple sources. ""He is terrified for people to know who he is,"" said one source familiar with the story. ""Somebody hurt him and scarred him badly, and the right person should be punished for that."" Florida in 2001 passed a statute allowing cases to be reopened for DNA testing. Four times Bain submitted handwritten motions seeking such testing, only to be denied. His fifth try was successful only after an appeals court ruled that he was entitled to a hearing. Bain's family has stood by him all of these years. His twin sister, Jannie Jones, told police that James was home with her, watching a popular television medical drama called ""Medical Center"" at the time of the attack. Another sister, Patsy Amos, said, ""I still don't understand why this happened, but we never doubted him. We knew what type of child he was."" It was incredibly frustrating, she said. ""It's just like a death, 'cause there was nothing we can do. He was a family member and we couldn't bring him home. There was nothing we could do. It was like death. We had no control over it,"" she told CNN. The prosecutor in the case, Edward Threadgill, is now retired after a career that culminated with a seat on the 2nd District Florida Appeals Court. He will be 78 this month. ""I don't remember any of the details [of the case],"" he told CNN. ""I don't remember the defendant."" But he added, ""It upsets me that an innocent man was in prison. It disturbs me greatly. ... I think we did the best with the technology we had. We did the best we could with what we had."" Bain's mother said that while her son was in prison he ""turned away from God, because he thought God abandoned him."" But, she said, she stayed on him -- on the phone, and during twice-a-month visits -- and eventually, over the years, he came back around to find God again, in prison. Watch report on the DNA exoneration of an Arizona man convicted of rape and murder . Now, she said, she is taking steps to ensure her son is taken care of in a world that has changed so much since he entered prison. She's putting her house and her car, a 1992 Toyota Camry, in his name. ""I want him to have something by himself. He's suffered enough. He will never worry about where to stay. No more suffering. He'll be taken care of, if anything happened to me,"" Sarah Reed said. ""He worries about me all the time. He thought he was doomed to stay there, and now he says, 'Don't let go. I'm coming home.'""","NEW: James Bain released from prison after more than three decades behind bars .

"London, England (CNN) -- The first double portrait of Britain's Princes William and Harry went on display Tuesday at the National Portrait Gallery. The painting shows the brothers dressed in their military uniforms, chatting to each other at their home at Clarence House, near Buckingham Palace. It is the first portrait to show William and Harry together, the National Portrait Gallery said. It will now hang in the museum alongside other portraits of the royal family. Artist Nicky Philipps said she was able to capture an informal moment, ""a behind-the-scenes glance at the human element of royal responsibility, and to emphasize their brotherly relationship."" Commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery, the painting shows Prince Harry seated next to Prince William, who is standing to his left. They are wearing the dress uniform of the Blues and Royals regiment of the Household Cavalry, where they are both lieutenants. William also wears the the star and blue sash of the Order of the Garter, a British order of chivalry, which the queen awarded him in 2008. William, 27, is now training to be a search-and-rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force, where he holds the rank of flight lieutenant. Harry, 25, who served in Afghanistan, is training to become a pilot with the Army Air Corps. ""The first portrait of the princes captures them formally dressed, but informally posed,"" said Sandy Nairne, the museum's director. ""It is a delightful image which extends the tradition of royal portraiture."" The National Portrait Gallery said it was appropriate that the princes were pictured at Clarence House, which used to be the home of the late Queen Mother. Part of a painting of the Queen Mother is visible above Harry's shoulder in the portrait, and paintings from her private collection are seen behind William. Philipps, 45, has had high-profile commissions before, but said it was a ""great privilege"" to paint the two princes. ""They were very good company and although I was commissioned to paint them in their official context, I hope I have also captured some of the brotherly banter that characterized the sittings,"" she said.","This is the first double portrait of Princes William and Harry .

"(CNN) -- Nude photos and other potentially objectionable materials have been showing up in the iPhone application store in recent weeks, raising questions about Apple's ability to control iPhone content. An iPhone app called BeautyMeter was pulled from the app store after a nude photo surfaced. In the most recent example, a nude photo of a young woman, reported to be 15 years old, showed up on an iPhone application called ""BeautyMeter,"" according to Wired.com and Krapps.com, an app review site. CNN could not independently confirm the young woman's age. The photo, which apparently was submitted by one of the photo-sharing app's users, prompted Apple to remove the entire mobile application from its online store. Funnymals, maker of the BeautyMeter app, which lets users upload and posts photos of people and then rank them based on ""hotness,"" says in a statement on its Web site that it agrees with Apple's decision to yank the phone application from its online store. Funnymals also says its policies prohibit people from posting nude photos to the application. Neither Funnymals nor Apple responded to requests for comment. About a week earlier, another mobile phone application, ""Hottest Girl,"" showcased a photo of a topless woman and also was pulled from the iPhone app store. ""Apple will not distribute applications that contain inappropriate content, such as pornography,"" an Apple company spokesman said at the time. The explicit material is putting attention on Apple's attempts to filter out potentially objectionable apps before they're posted on its app store. The iPhone app store, with more than 50,000 applications, is the most popular entertainment and information venue of its kind for mobile phones. Observers say the successful app store buoys the iPhone's popularity and adds to Apple's sterling image as a hip and family-friendly company. The explicit content has the potential to tarnish that image. But Apple, like any company or Web site that hosts user-submitted content, may be engaged an impossible task by trying to keep all offensive material from the app store. Some iPhone apps are developed by Apple, but many are submitted for approval by third-party developers. Phil Malone, a clinical professor of law at Harvard Law School, said it's unlikely Apple or app developers could be held liable for potentially illegal content that might show up in phone apps, as long as they didn't know about the questionable content in advance. It would be impossible for Apple or developers to keep all potentially objectionable material out of the app store, since much of the content is submitted by users, he said. As the quantity of new apps and updates for apps increases, it becomes all the more difficult for the company to keep up, said Dan Moren, associate editor of Macworld, a blog about all things Apple. Joshua Topolsky, editor in chief of Engadget, a technology blog, said the impossibility of policing all app store content should free Apple from some blame. ""It's completely out of Apple's control that someone uploaded a nude photo, and to some extent, it's out of the [app] developer's hands as well,"" he said. More pressing, Topolsky said, are Apple's nebulous policies about which apps get the company's stamp of approval. Apple does not tell developers or the public exactly how the decision process works, he said. Apple did not respond to CNN's request for comment on this story. The mysterious approval process frustrates app developers and could lead some to turn away from Apple and move on to other phones, said Jared Brown, an app developer. In some cases, applications have been banned from the iPhone app store for showcasing material that also would be easily accessible through iTunes or by using Apple's mobile Web browser. A Nine Inch Nails application, for example, reportedly was pulled by Apple because it streamed a song with offensive lyrics. Band leader Trent Reznor lashed out against Apple on his Web site, calling the company hypocritical and pointing out that the song in question also was available on iTunes. In a similar incident, a Twitter app called ""Tweetie"" was pulled because it gave access to offensive words on Twitter.com. It was later put back on the app store. And an iPhone app that allowed users to shake a digital crying baby to death was yanked from the app store in April. Apple issued an apology, calling the app ""deeply offensive"" and a ""mistake."" Unlike Apple, which acts as a gatekeeper, Google lets developers post games and other programs to its Android app store without going through a screening process. Brown said he favors this idea, which lets the Android store's community flag objectionable content. Apple has said it approves 96 percent of submitted iPhone apps. In a recent update to the iPhone software, Apple included controls that let users choose which types of content they would like to block from their phones. iPhone apps now come with age-appropriateness labels, submitted by developers. Moren said this new parental-control system offers ""fine-grained controls"" and helps iPhone owners decide what content they want to buy. The company is doing anything it can to try to keep pornography and offensive material off the site for public relations reasons, he said. ""They'd much rather hang onto their image as a family-friendly company"" than let offensive material in, he said. ""I think they've really cultivated that.""","Reports say iPhone app posted nude photo of 15-year-old girl .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Rep. Patrick Murphy, an Iraq war veteran, kicked off a push Wednesday to persuade Americans that the president should repeal ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the policy that prevents openly gay troops from serving in the U.S. military. Rep. Patrick Murphy, a veteran of the Iraq war, says it is time to end ""don't ask, don't tell."" Murphy, D-Pennsylvania, appeared along with several gay, lesbian and straight service members to launch the initiative. ""We can not afford to wait any longer"" for the policy's repeal, Murphy said at the National Press Club in Washington. ""Now is the time to change this, when our military is stretched so thin"" with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. A ""Voices of Honor"" tour, sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign, will travel across the country, sharing stories of gay, lesbian and straight servicemen and -women in hopes of garnering support for the Military Readiness Enhancement Act, which would repeal the law that established the policy. The act would allow gay and lesbian Americans to serve in the military without concealing their sexuality. Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese said in a statement, ""We must repeal this discriminatory policy and ensure that our military can recruit and retain the best and the brightest troops regardless of their sexual orientation."" President Obama has said he wants Congress to repeal the law, but gay rights groups have been angered that the president has not done more to hasten the change. Since Obama took office, 287 service members have been discharged for being gay, according to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, which supports the repeal. The bill, introduced by Colin Powell in 1993 and signed into law by President Clinton, ended the protocol requiring service members to state their sexual orientation. But Powell now says the time has come to review whether the policy is still necessary. ""Sixteen years have now gone by, and I think a lot has changed with respect to attitudes within our country, and therefore I think this is a policy and a law that should be reviewed,"" Powell said. ""I am withholding judgment, because the commanders of the armed forces of the United States and the joint chiefs of staff need to study it and make recommendations to the president and have hearings before the Congress before a decision is made,"" he added. The military's top uniformed officer, Adm. Mike Mullen, said Wednesday that it's clear the president wants the law changed and that he is beginning to work with his staff on how a repeal would be implemented. But, he advised, with two wars ongoing, that the decision not be hurried. ""When I talk about looking at this in the future, we have a force that's under extraordinary stress, and it's a force that, you know, should this occur, I think we need to implement in a way that is -- that recognizes the challenges and the stress that we're under right now,"" said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""But, if it does occur, when it does occur, you know, I'll certainly lead it and carry it out."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently said he is looking for ways to make the policy ""more humane,"" including letting people serve who may have been outed because of vengeance or a jilted lover. But there is plenty of opposition to the repeal. In the spring, more than 1,000 retired officers signed a letter organized by Flag and General Officers for the Military urging Obama to uphold the law. ""We believe that imposing this burden on our men and women in uniform would undermine recruiting and retention, impact leadership at all levels, have adverse effects on the willingness of parents who lend their sons and daughters to military service, and eventually break the all-volunteer force,"" the letter said. The recent shooting death of a sailor has also raised questions about acceptance of gays among troops. The family of Seaman August Provost of Houston, Texas, said they believe that he was killed because of his sexual orientation and his race. But a spokesman for Camp Pendleton, where the shooting took place, said there was no indication early in the investigation that the killing was a hate crime. Still, Genevieve Chase, a straight veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom and the founder of American Women's Veterans, said she believes that not much would change in the military if ""don't ask, don't tell"" were repealed. Chase appeared with Murphy at the event Wednesday in Washington. Calling them service members of a ""new era,"" Chase said, ""Gays have been and are already serving openly. ... Allowing discrimination and bigotry to continue is what disrupts cohesion."" There is no clear timeline for when the bill will be debated in Congress. Obama has said he will sign the repeal if it comes to his desk.","NEW: Amid wars, decision should not be hasty, Joint Chiefs chair says .

"PADANG, Indonesia (CNN) -- As many as 4,000 people could be buried under the rubble in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes in Indonesia, United Nations officials said Saturday. Indonesian soldiers crawl under the rubble of a collapsed building to search for victims. Local disaster management officials put the death toll from the quakes at 540. Earlier U.N. figures that put the death toll at 1,100 were just estimates, said El-Mostafa Benlamlih, a U.N. humanitarian coordinator. A 7.6-magnitude quake struck Sumatra on Wednesday and a 6.6-magnitude earthquake hit Thursday morning in the same region. Wednesday's quake reduced buildings to rubble in the city. People used hammers, chisels and bare hands to dig through debris for survivors and belongings.  Watch CNN's Arwa Damon report on search-and-rescue efforts » . Staff at a local hospital treated the injured outside the semi-collapsed building as bodies of the dead lay in makeshift morgues. An area that now looks like a flattened mess of destruction was, just days ago, a group of three villages. Officials believe 90 percent of the residents -- as many as a few hundred people -- were buried, just one piece of the devastation from two large earthquakes that struck Indonesia in as many days. The stench of dead bodies fills the air. Indonesia's health ministry and ministry of social affairs said Friday they believe thousands remain buried beneath rubble. The West Sumatran capital, Padang, with about a million residents, is near the epicenter. CNN's Arwa Damon spoke with a few dozen survivors from these villages in the area, most of whom only made it through because they weren't home during the quake. They remained huddled together in a tent, in shock over what had happened. One older woman said eight of her family members were buried. She had been buried up to her chest and had to dig herself out. Another survivor, a 27-year-old man, told CNN four of his family members were killed. His home used to be on top of a cliff in the area. Now, there is only mud. Search and rescue teams are working with the military, but so far, only 25 bodies have been recovered. With each passing day, the scope of the devastation grows.  Watch aftermath at house leveled by quake » . President Obama spoke with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Friday after trying several times to reach him, the White House said. Obama received an update on the situation on the ground from Yudhoyono in the five-minute call. The White House statement says Obama ""offered, on behalf of the United States, to do everything we can to help alleviate the suffering and provide assistance to the relief operation."" The U.N.'s Holmes told reporters Thursday that hundreds are believed to be injured. ""These numbers, I fear, will rise as more information becomes available,"" he added. Telecommunications are difficult in the region, roads are cut off, and the hardest-hit area, including Padang, lacks power and other services, Holmes said. In addition, heavy rainfall has hindered search and rescue efforts. Some have suggested the damage may be worse than that of a 6.3-magnitude quake centered in the central Java city of Yogyakarta in May 2006, Holmes said. That temblor killed more than 5,000 people and triggered fears of an eruption from a nearby volcano. Many people wandered the streets of Padang stunned and dazed. Some searched the rubble for survivors. Staff at a local hospital treated the injured outside the semi-collapsed building as bodies of the dead lay in makeshift morgues. Several of the hospital's buildings were severely damaged. Damage in the town itself was spotty; some buildings remained intact near others in ruins. ""Aftershocks can be just as devastating as the initial quake,"" said Adjie Fachrurrazi, emergency response coordinator in Indonesia for the CARE aid organization, in a statement. ""After an earthquake of this size, we know the immediate needs are going to be getting safe water, food and emergency supplies to the survivors. The question now is: How bad is it? We're hoping for the best, but the information so far is not looking good."" Amelia Merrick, the operations director for World Vision Indonesia, described the situation as ""quite devastating."" ""Bridges have gone down, phone lines are in total disrepair,"" she said. ""It's difficult for us to assess the situation."" Earlier this month, an earthquake in West Java killed 57 people.

"(CNN) -- Reality TV star Tila Tequila first came to fame via social networking, thanks to her popularity on MySpace. Tila Tequila went quiet on Twitter after an alleged violent incident with an NFL player. Later, she became known as one of the most voracious celebrity tweeters, boasting more than 243,000 followers on Twitter. But it was a more archaic form of technology -- a phone call to police -- that briefly quieted her social media activities and thrust the petite personality into the national spotlight after an allegedly violent encounter with an NFL player. Tequila, whose real name is Tila Nguyen, said she was assaulted by Shawne Merriman, a linebacker with the San Diego Chargers. He has denied the charges.  Watch player's lawyer react to allegations » . According to a statement from the sheriff's department of San Diego County, California, authorities responded to a disturbance call early Sunday from a woman who said she had been choked and restrained by a male. When police arrived, ""the reporting party identified herself as Tila Nguyen, aka Tila Tequila, and her alleged assailant as Shawne Merriman,"" the statement said. Nguyen, who starred in MTV's ""A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila"" and its follow-up, ""A Shot at Love 2 With Tila Tequila,"" signed a citizen's arrest at the scene and was transported to a local hospital, authorities said. Merriman was taken into custody on suspicion of battery and false imprisonment, the sheriff's department statement said. Merriman's attorney, Todd Macaluso, told reporters that Nguyen was ""extremely intoxicated and inebriated"" at the time of the incident and that the player tried to make arrangements for her to leave the house. After hours of Twitter silence, Nguyen tweeted Sunday evening that she was safe at home in Los Angeles and thanked fans for their concern and support. She also appeared to deny Merriman and his attorney's claim by tweeting, ""I am allergic to alcohol. It has been publicly known for years. That is how I got the name Tila 'Tequila' cuz the irony. I can't drink."" For a few hours on Monday the privacy setting on her Twitter page, @officialTila, was turned on to protect her tweets from being viewed by outsiders. Ian Corbin, founder of CelebrityTweet, said Nguyen is one of the top celebrity tweeters, often posting more than 100 tweets a day. Her abundance of followers has earned her a ranking of ""hot,"" said Corbin, whose site gathers the tweets of about 250 celebrities. Nguyen went quiet before, he said, when there were rumors that she was pregnant by a hip-hop artist. Corbin said he is not surprised that her tweeting has decreased in light of the incident. ""She probably has a legal team telling her not to say much,"" he said. Ardent Tequila fans on Twitter are known as members of the ""TilaArmy,"" and many rallied online after learning of the incident. ""@officialTila you know your #TilaArmy is here 4 your support no matter what!!!!,"" tweeted user BeToRC. Sasha Pasulka, head writer of the entertainment Web site Evil Beet, said Nguyen may have fallen into the trap that many face in their pursuit of celebrity: not being able to shield their personal lives. ""The fame doesn't stop just because something bad happens to you and you want some space,"" Pasulka said. ""It's the same thing you saw with Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan."" The high-profile nature of the domestic violence case involving singers Chris Brown and Rihanna has heightened public interest in such incidents, Pasulka added.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN)  -- An Iranian national security official has called for demonstrators to be arrested following deadly weekend anti-government protests in Tehran. Soon afterward, an opposition Web site reported a wave of arrests. ""The undignified and disruptive behavior of the rioters is no longer tolerable for our people, since they have brought undignified behaviors to new heights by offending sanctities and values held dear in Islam and Iran,"" Naghavi Hosseini, a member of the Parliamentary National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, told state-run IRNA. ""The Nation's Judiciary must swiftly arrest the rioters who committed those crimes."" An opposition Web site, NoroozNews, said government officials took several activists into custody Monday, including some close advisors to opposition leader and former presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi. The government did not immediately respond to the report. Meanwhile, the death toll from Sunday's anti-government protests in Tehran stood at eight, the country's Supreme National Security Council said. Are you in Iran? Share your photos and video and tell us what's going on. With tight restrictions on international media, CNN could not independently verify the casualties that were reported Monday by state-run Press TV. The Press TV report did not say how many others were arrested. But earlier, Iran's Deputy Police Chief Ahmad Reza Radan said on state television station IRINN that more than 300 were taken into custody. Opposition Web site Rahesabz.net reported the arrests of at least three figures from the reformist movement and also noted that Tehran's text messaging system had slowed to a crawl with the outbreak in violence. The toll was the result of clashes that broke out between demonstrators and security forces as large crowds gathered for Ashura, a major religious observance that marks the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of Prophet Mohammed, as a martyr. Some demonstrators over the weekend compared Ayatollah Khamenei -- the supreme leader of the nation's hardline Islamic government -- to Yazid, the caliph who killed Imam Hussein. Radan said those killed included one person who fell off a bridge and two others who were killed in a car accident during the protests. One of the victims was killed by a bullet, Radan said. But ""considering the fact that the police did not use firearms, this incident is extremely suspicious, and is being investigated,"" he added. Mousavi's Web site reported that his nephew, Seyed Ali Mousavi, was killed in the demonstrations by a shot to the heart. Press TV late Sunday quoted unnamed police officials as identifying one of the dead as ""Seyyed Ali Mousavi"" but it did not mention the elder Mousavi or any relationship between the two men. Tehran Police Chief Azizollah Rajabzadeh denied that any protesters were killed by security forces. Police did not fire any shots in Tehran, ""and security forces were not in possession of firearms,"" Rajabzadeh told the semi-official news agency ISNA. The state has also said it believes some of the videos may have been staged in order to make the government look bad. The English Web site of state-run news agency IRNA led Monday with a story about Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, planning a visit to Tajikistan. Of about 20 headlines on the main screen of the Web site, none mentioned the protests. Since the disputed presidential elections in June, protesters have turned public gatherings into rallies against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was declared the overwhelming winner of the race. CNN's Reza Sayah, an Iran native who covers the region, has called recent events an unprecedented uprising, presenting ""the most significant challenge"" the Islamic republic has faced since its government came to power through a revolution 30 years ago. ""Its strength, its power over these past 30 years has been repression, has been intimidation of anyone who's dissented,"" but the government hasn't managed to quell this rebellion, Sayah said. ""And you look at this opposition movement, and you have to ask yourself how. They don't have a strong leader. They don't have a structure. They don't have an organization. But somehow they manage to mobilize and move out."" The unrest Sunday followed day-long clashes between the two sides in the streets of Tehran on Saturday. On Saturday evening, a pro-government mob barged into a mosque where former president and reformist leader Mohammad Khatami was speaking. The dozens-strong group forced Khatami to end his remarks abruptly when it interrupted the gathering at Jamaran mosque. The protests also came as Iranians were mourning the Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, a key figure in the 1979 Iranian revolution. Montazeri went on to become one of the government's most vocal critics. Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council in Washington, D.C. -- a public critic of Iran's hardline government -- told CNN's ""American Morning: ""I think this may actually turn out to be a breaking point. What we've seen here is how the opposition, six months after the fraud in elections, still have a lot of fight in them. ""I think they've taken the Iranian authorities by surprise. They're still coming out in huge numbers, and morale seems to be stronger amongst the opposition than among the security forces at this point."" ""This could very well end up being one of those indicators that this is not just going to end -- this is going to go for something that can be causing a dramatic change, not only in Iran but in the region as a whole."" -- CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report .","NEW: Clashes broke out as large crowds gathered for major religious observance Ashura .

"(CNN) -- Phillip Garrido, who is accused of kidnapping and raping an 11-year-old and then holding her captive for 18 years, apologized in a jailhouse letter sent to a television station, the California station said Thursday. But prosecutors responded, saying Garrido was attempting to manipulate public perceptions of the case. In the handwritten letter this week to CNN affiliate KCRA, Garrido seemed to address the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. ""First off I want to apologize to every human being for what has taken place,"" KCRA said the letter states. The second sentence of the letter appeared to refer to what Garrido has described as a religious transformation that cured him of his sexual deviancy. It says: ""People all over the world are hearing testimony that through the spirit of Christ a mental process took place ending a sexual problem believed to be impossible."" Prosecutors charged that Garrido was being manipulative -- and not for the first time. ""It appears once again that Mr. Garrido seeks leniency due to claims of religious transformation and alleged personal change,"" retorted a statement released by the El Dorado County district attorney's office. ""Our office fully intends to hold Mr. Garrido legally accountable for his actions and see that he is punished to the full extent of the law,"" the statement said, noting that the assertion was ""eerily similar to what Mr. Garrido told the judge who sentenced him in 1977 and the parole board when he duped them into releasing him from prison after serving only 11 years of a 50-year federal sentence ... "" Garrido's letter, which is the third sent to KCRA, also addressed other issues, but the station declined to release more details. ""We are not releasing the entire letter at this time based on consultations with our attorneys,"" said Anzio Williams, news director at KCRA. ""We will tell the story and reference the letter."" Read earlier letter from Garrido to KCRA (PDF) Garrido and his wife, Nancy, face multiple felony charges in the 1991 kidnapping of Dugard from South Lake Tahoe, California. Authorities say he and his wife held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home in Antioch, California, for 18 years. The Garridos have pleaded not guilty. Dugard now lives in seclusion with her mother, Terry Probyn, and Dugard's two daughters, who police say were fathered by Garrido. In September, an attorney for Dugard's family said it had been a difficult transition for her and her daughters, who are now 11 and 15, given that her captivity spanned more than half her life and was the only world she knew for so long. ""But there is no question that she knows that terrible and wrong things were done to her and that those people must be held accountable,"" McGregor Scott said. Dugard will testify against the Garridos, Scott said. He also acknowledged that Dugard would have to relive the trauma in court by sharing the ""very, very sordid tale.""","NEW: Prosecutor disputes Phillip Garrido's jailhouse apology letter .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Blake Mycoskie was traveling in South America when he saw, for the first time, hundreds of children without shoes. TOMS founder and entrepreneur Blake Mycoskie says he wanted to make money and do good at the same time. ""I had never met anyone who didn't have shoes,"" the veteran entrepreneur told CNN. That visit to a village in Argentina inspired the creation of a socially responsible footwear company that blends philanthropy and business. Mycoskie called the company TOMS: Shoes For Tomorrow -- a name that reflects his desire to provide shoes for disadvantaged children in a sustainable way. Mycoskie, now 32, said he realized he could make money and do good at the same time with TOMS. The company's mission is uncomplicated: It gives a free pair of shoes to a child in need every time it sells a pair. Santa Monica, Calif.-based TOMS gave away 10,000 pairs of shoes in the first six months after its launch in 2006. This year the company is on track to donate 200,000 pairs. The stylish slip-ons, which Vogue magazine declared ""cool shoes for a cool cause,"" have become a must-have item among fashion elite and received the People's Design Award from the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt Museum last year. By the time he launched TOMS, Mycoskie already had four start-ups under his belt. But he didn't always have his sights set on the business world. Growing up, his aim was to play professional tennis. He trained hard and earned a scholarship to Southern Methodist University, where he studied philosophy and finance. But an injury sidelined him his sophomore year. That's when he got the idea for his first venture, a college laundry service. Within one year, the business, Easy Laundry, had 40 employees, had expanded to three schools and was generating nearly $1 million in sales. That's when Mycoskie realized he was born to be an entrepreneur and dropped out of school. ""I realized I loved doing this. I realized I loved the idea of creating something out of scratch and seeing it work and seeing the benefits of that,"" he said. Mycoskie eventually sold the company and began other ventures, including an outdoor advertising company and a 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week reality TV channel, which he launched after appearing on the second season of ""The Amazing Race"" with his sister. They finished the competition in third place (missing out on the million-dollar prize by just four minutes), but the experience exposed Mycoskie to the astounding amount of poverty in the world -- a problem that TOMS is tackling today, one pair of shoes at a time.","Entrepreneur Blake Mycoskie is blending philanthropy with business .

"(CNN) -- Sitting at her home in West Seattle, Washington, Amanda Knox's aunt Janet Huff was watching the live television news coverage that her niece had been convicted of murder. ""It was terrible, it was gut-wrenching just to hear them say it,"" Huff said of the verdict. She had been up for more than 11 hours while the jury deliberated, anxiously awaiting word. She remained hopeful but deeply afraid. She couldn't eat. When the verdict was announced at about midnight in Perugia, Italy, her worst fears came true. Knox and her Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted of murdering Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher. Knox was sentenced to 26 years and Sollecito 25 years in prison. Following the verdict, people flooded out of the Italian courtroom. When the prosecution emerged, a rush of applause followed. ""To see the people outside the courtroom applauding -- that just made me sick, that people can be that callous and cold,"" Huff said. Soon after the verdict, Knox's parents, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, emerged and swiftly moved through the crowd. Watch Janet Huff's interview with CNN's Campbell Brown . Huff said she spoke to Knox's parents shortly after the verdict. ""They are, of course, shattered. They are not doing great,"" Huff said. ""But we have already started the process of appeals. That's all we can do."" For Huff, Knox is still the strong, kindhearted girl she has always known -- not the cold-blooded killer prosecutors portrayed during the trial. Huff said Knox was worried about the trial's impact on the family. ""I think that's what gets her through, knowing that she's got to be strong,"" she said. ""If she falls apart, then we are really going to lose it. Knox's parents: Our daughter is no killer . ""I know she is terribly disappointed, heartbroken and scared to death, but she's more concerned about her family and how we are."" With Knox's conviction, Huff said the family was moving forward with plans for some relatives to move to Italy to be near Knox. The cost and physical toll of constantly traveling to Italy was weighing on the family, she said. ""We've looked at jobs and apartments just in case this happened,"" she said. ""There's no way we are going to leave Amanda in Italy all alone."" Knox's case has attracted widespread media attention and prompted salacious articles focusing on her sex life. Her name and photo have appeared on the front pages of newspapers all over the world, and now, Huff fears, things may get worse. ""Now that there's a guilty verdict, she's always going to be remembered as 'The convicted killer Amanda Knox,' and I'm disgusted by that,"" Huff said. Maria Cantwell, a U.S. senator from Knox's home state of Washington, issued a statement saying she was ""saddened by the verdict."" ""I have serious questions about the Italian justice system and whether anti-Americanism tainted this trial,"" Cantwell said. ""I will be conveying my concerns to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."" Huff said she hopes the appeals process will show what her family has believed all along. ""She will be vindicated and she will be found innocent,"" she said. Despite the pain the trial has brought Knox's family, Huff stressed it is nothing compared to what victim Meredith Kercher's family has gone through. ""They still don't have closure, they may think they are vindicated with the guilty verdict but we know it doesn't bring their daughter back,"" she said.","Janet Huff: ""It was terrible, it was gut-wrenching just to hear them say it""

"(CNN)  -- When film director Kevin Smith tweeted about getting kicked off a Southwest Airlines flight on Saturday, the airline responded in less than 20 minutes. ""Dear @SouthwestAir - I know I'm fat, but was Captain Leysath really justified in throwing me off a flight for which I was already seated?"" Smith tweeted at 6:52 p.m. ""@ThatKevinSmith hey Kevin! I'm so sorry for your experience tonight! Hopefully we can make things right, please follow so we may [direct message]!"" the airline responded at 7:08 p.m. The airline contacted Smith personally to apologize for bumping the director of ""Clerks"" off a standby flight, accommodated him on a later flight, and sent him a $100 travel voucher for his inconvenience. Southwest did not immediately return calls or a Twitter message for comment but posted a statement on its blog apologizing to Smith and explaining its ""Customer of Size"" policy, which ""requires passengers that can not fit safely and comfortably in one seat to purchase an additional seat while traveling."" Kevin Smith 'too fat' to fly Southwest . But if Kevin Smith were, say, John Smith, who worked in Muncie, Indiana, instead of Hollywood, California, would he have gotten the same response to his tweets? ""If the company is actively using social media -- and I think that most companies are using social media -- I think the consumer stands a great chance of hearing directly from the company and being engaged and having their issues resolved,"" said Steve Loucks, vice president of communications for Travel Leaders, a large travel agency network. Southwest has more than a million followers on Twitter. Loucks believes the majority of travel companies now are using sites including Twitter and Facebook to get feedback from their consumers. ""If someone feels they are not being heard, social media is a very visible way to tell your friends, the people that follow you, that you're not happy and hopefully the company will be paying attention,"" Loucks said. Adam Ostrow, editor-in-chief of social media site Mashable.com, says many big brands are starting to dedicate entire teams to social media monitoring, because they know it's important to respond quickly to negative comments before they become a public relations nightmare. Yet there's a difference, Ostrow said, between responding and being able to fix the problem. ""For example, if you tweet that your plane has been stuck on the runway for four hours, JetBlue can respond to you, but they're likely not in a position to do anything about getting your plane off the ground,"" Ostrow said. JetBlue, which wasn't involved in the Kevin Smith incident, is one of the most followed airlines, with more than 1.6 million followers on Twitter. JetBlue has six people who watch the airline's social media presence. The team rarely handles issues personally -- instead directing customers to the right resource for their complaints or questions. ""We consider ourselves more of an information booth rather than a customer service counter,"" public communications manager Morgan Johnston said. Johnston says all JetBlue customers are equally important, but someone with a larger voice may get noticed, and responded to by the team, faster. Ostrow recommends using the company's Twitter name in your complaint to get noticed, as most teams are set up to monitor for these mentions. He also suggests keeping your character count short so that others can easily retweet and share their own thoughts on the issue. In her Mashable article ""HOW TO: Get Your Feedback Heard on Social Networks,"" media director Mollie Vandor offers additional tips. ""First, always remember that the person on the other end of Twitter is, well, a person,"" Vandor writes. ""Patience is key. You will get a better response if you give your recipient some time to look into the issue before they respond."" She also suggests avoiding people at the top of the company, instead looking for people who mention user experience, community or support on their Twitter profiles. Most of all, it's important to hit the normal channels first before going on a social media rant, Travel Leaders' Loucks said -- give the system time to work and only try the more high profile online complaints if the company doesn't respond satisfactorily. ""We'd want to know about it not only because we want happy customers but because we want to make sure that that never happens again.""","Kevin Smith gets quick response to his complaint about Southwest Airlines .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- James Bond would be lost without them -- those madcap gadgets merging two technologies that help him beat the bad guys and save the planet. The underwater watch with a built-in Geiger counter, for example; or the car that doubles as a submarine; or the exploding bagpipes and missile-launching wheelchair. An artist's impression of what a Flying Electric Generator might look like . Now a U.S. company has taken a leaf out of 007's book and developed a similarly unlikely ""combination"" technology. The ""villain"" in this case is not a psychotic, cat-stroking megalomaniac, but something both more prosaic and, potentially, more threatening -- global warming: in particular, how to meet the world's energy needs without swamping the planet with clouds of atmosphere-clogging pollutants. And the madcap gadget that might just provide a solution? A helicopter that doubles as a wind turbine. Or, to give it its technical name, a FEG (Flying Electric Generator). The brainchild of Australian engineering specialist Professor Bryan Roberts, the FEG is being developed by San Diego-based company SkyWindPower. Code-cracker turned turbine enthusiast . The latter is headed by David Shepard, who started his career cracking Japanese military ciphers during World War Two, and went on to create the Farrington B numeric font that appears on credit cards around the world. Shepard has long been convinced of the need for a new global energy source to reduce reliance on carbon-emitting fossil fuels. For the last two decades his attention has focused on the electricity-generating potential of high-altitude winds, and when he learnt of Professor Roberts' prototype ""gyromill"" -- a flying wind turbine that the Australian had been developing since 1979 -- he decided it offered the best model for realizing that potential. The two men started working together in 2002, and the FEG is the result. High-altitude winds . The guiding principle of the FEG is that wind speed and constancy are far greater at high altitude than they are on the ground, especially in the two major jet streams - the Sub-Tropical Jet and the Polar Front Jet - that exist in each hemisphere (at around 30 degrees and 60 degrees latitude respectively). A turbine at great height, so the theory goes, can generate far more power than a similar turbine at or near ground level. It has been estimated that capturing just one percent of the available energy of these high altitude winds would meet the electricity needs of the entire planet. ""The winds a few miles above the mid latitudes of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are far stronger and more persistent than the winds just above us,"" Shepard told CNN. ""This results in potentially being able to generate electricity for over eighty percent of the time, as opposed to thirty percent of the time at ground-based wind turbine sites. ""The largest ground-based wind turbines currently produce about five megawatts each. We expect typical FEGs to produce about 20 megawatts each."" Helicopter technology . But how do we get a working turbine up to the necessary height -- at least 15,000 ft (4600 meters) above the earth's surface? That's where helicopter technology comes in. Taking the form of a giant H-shaped frame, the prototype FEG has four huge blades at the four points of the H, each blade 10.7 meters (35 feet) in diameter. These act like the rotors of a helicopter, lifting the FEG to the required height. Once in place, the blades not only keep the FEG air-born, providing lift like the surface area of a kite, but also act as turbines, turning dynamos within the platform that generate electricity, which is transmitted back to earth through a vast aluminum tethering cable. An in-built GPS (Global Positioning System) uses satellite technology to ensure that the FEG always remains in the same place, both vertically and horizontally. According to Shepard, development is already at an advanced stage. ""Professor Roberts demonstrated a FEG in Australia at an altitude of sixty feet over a decade ago,"" he told CNN. U.S. demonstration in three years . ""We expect to make a demonstration in the U.S. less than three years from now at high altitude in normal high altitude winds. In four years I would expect this sort of technology to be in active use."" As with ground-based wind farms, Shepard envisages whole ""sky-farms"" of FEGs hovering above the earth in restricted airspace. Forty-three such FEG ""arrays"" -- each comprising 600 FEGs -- would, he estimates, generate sufficient electricity to power the whole of the U.S. ""Our calculations show that by reserving less than one four-hundredth of U.S. air space, located at relatively remote locations not on airway routes, all of America's electrical energy needs could be met,"" he says. ""That is considerably less airspace than is already restricted for other purposes, primarily military."" Not only would the FEGs provide clean energy -- the feedback from environmental groups, according to Shepard, has been overwhelmingly positive -- but at less cost than conventional electricity generation. While each FEG would cost an estimated $2,260,000 to build, maintain and support, arrays of FEGS would, in the long term, prove extremely cost effective, generating electricity at about 2 cents per kilowatt hour, as opposed to the 3-5 cents of conventional generating methods. There are risks, of course. Even in restricted airspace there is the possibility of collision with aircraft that unwittingly -- or illegally -- stray into that airspace. Likewise, despite numerous design features aimed at ensuring the stability of the air-born FEG, the possibility of the structure malfunctioning and plummeting to earth cannot be excluded. Crashes ""inevitable"" ""Inevitably crashes will occur,"" the SkyWindPower Web site acknowledges, ""Just as airplane crashes occur. ""Statistically, however, FEGs should be just as reliable as commercial airliners, whose safety records are incredibly good. ""And FEGs don't take off or land at airports teeming with people in and around them."" Shepard and Roberts are not the only people to have considered harnessing the power of high-altitude winds. Magenn Power, a Canadian company, have been developing a helium-filled, medium altitude wind generator, while in the Netherlands Laddermill has been exploring similar ground using kite technology. SkyWindPower's FEG, however, is at the forefront of the field, with the U.S. government showing considerable interest in the prototype helicopter-cum-wind-turbine. Whether it will provide a definitive solution to the world's ever-increasing energy needs remains to be seen. With the effects of global warming and climate change becoming increasingly acute, however, a technology that might once have been dismissed as no more than a James Bond fantasy now looks as if it could have a serious role to play. They might not be quite as sexy as your average Bond adventure, but flying wind turbines could end up generating a lot more heat than 007 and Pussy Galore ever did. .......................................

"O'Fallon, Missouri (CNN) -- Nathan Halbach is 22, with a diagnosis of terminal brain cancer. He knows that ""horrible stuff"" lies ahead. His mother, Pat Bond, has been taking care of him full time. But when she needed help, she reached out to the Roman Catholic Church. After all, his father is a priest. Nathan was born in 1986, during a five-year affair between his mother and Father Henry Willenborg, the Franciscan priest who celebrated Nathan's baptism. In a story first reported in the New York Times, it was revealed that The Franciscan Order drew up an agreement acknowledging the boy's paternity and agreeing to pay child support in exchange for a pledge of confidentiality. Now her son -- the youngest of four children -- may have just weeks to live. And when the Franciscans balked at paying for his care, she decided she was no longer bound by her pledge of confidentiality. ""I never asked for extraordinary amounts. I asked for the basic needs and care of my son,"" Bond told CNN's ""AC 360.""  But she said the church told her, ""No, we are not Nathan's biological father, we have no legal obligation to your son."" Willenborg, whose priestly vows require celibacy, has been suspended from his most recent assignment, in northern Wisconsin, as Catholic leaders investigate allegations that he was involved with another woman -- then in high school -- around the same time he was seeing Bond. Willenborg has acknowledged his relationship with Bond, but denies any inappropriate relationship with the other woman while she was a minor, according to his current bishop. And his order acknowledges its agreement to support his son, telling CNN they have paid about $233,000 to support Nathan over his lifetime. Since the affair has become public, the Franciscan Order has agreed to pick up Nathan's medical bills and the costs for the funeral that now appears likely. Willenborg refused to speak to CNN. But a statement to his parishioners in Ashland, Wisconsin, in September, said, ""My failure to be faithful to my vows has caused me and many others pain and disappointment. I have regretted this for a long time."" And in October, he told The New York Times, ""We've been very caring, very supportive, very generous over these 20-something years. It's very tragic what's going on with Nathan."" Bond, then Patricia Halbach, said she and Willenborg began their affair in 1983. At the time, Willenborg was a priest in her hometown of Quincy, Illinois, about 130 miles north of St. Louis, Missouri. Bond, then a 27-year-old, married mother of three, went to a retreat for women with troubled relationships. Willenborg was the retreat's spiritual director, and she said he was a ""terrific"" priest -- ""incredibly charismatic, very sought-after."" He began to counsel her on a regular basis. After about three months, at the end of one of their sessions, she said he kissed her. Bond said she went home and immediately asked her husband for a separation, and she said she began a romantic relationship with Willenborg. Bond said she knew he was forbidden to have sex with her. But she said when in love, ""You don't think clearly."" ""I make stupid decisions in my life,"" she said. ""I am not perfect, far from sainthood, and I loved him."" During their relationship, Bond was a lay leader in the church, and ""We were a very good team, a very dynamic team,"" she said. But in 1985, she learned she was pregnant. The pregnancy ended with a miscarriage that October. She said in its aftermath, she ended her sexual relationship with Willenborg, only to resume it the following spring. It was during that period that Nathan was conceived, she said. Nathan was born in December 1986. Willenborg had to disclose the affair and Bond's pregnancy to his superiors. A deal was negotiated by Father Robert Karris, who told CNN the Franciscans insisted on confidentiality ""to protect Nathan, his mother, and the priest."" But Karris, now on the research faculty of the Franciscan Institute at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, New York, also acknowledged the goal in part was to protect the church. The agreement was reached about a year after Nathan's birth. Afterward, Willenborg was removed from his job, and it was 17 years before he would lead a congregation again. He told his superiors that his relationship with Bond was over, but she said it continued. ""That was the statement, and they bought it,"" Bond said. ""But the truth of the matter is during those eight month of negotiations, we were living together physically, sexually and every form of relationship there was under their nose."" The relationship went on until Nathan was nearly 2 years old, Bond said. She and Willenborg went on family outings, including a trip to Florida, with Nathan and her children from her previous marriage. Back in Quincy, where she grew up, Bond said she had a simple answer to questions about Nathan's parentage: ""He's my baby."" But things ended in 1988, after Bond learned that Willenborg was seeing another woman. She eventually moved from Quincy to a St. Louis suburb. ""You had to go away, you had to take your story, you had to take your children, you had to get out of this town. We're a small community, everybody knew everybody,"" she said. Nathan grew up as a popular, athletic boy, a big fan of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball club and the Blues hockey team. He has autographs of the entire hockey team and a Cardinals uniform signed by All-Star first baseman Albert Pujols. For years, he said, he wanted a relationship with his father. ""He's popped in and out of my life, but I've never gotten the full respect and love out of him that I would always want,"" he said. But several years ago, after Willenborg took him out to dinner on their first night out in years, he said his father didn't seem to want to have anything to do with him. ""When it comes to this person who's my dad, who should be helping me out more than a person on the street, he hasn't done so throughout my 20-plus years of life,"" Nathan said. Nathan was diagnosed with cancer in 2006. Over the summer, he and his mother went to New York's Sloan-Kettering cancer center in a last-ditch effort to halt the disease. It was unsuccessful, and doctors give him a prognosis of weeks. ""If I just live my life as happy as I can, I can have a lot of fun until this horrible stuff happens,"" he said. The church had paid for some medical expenses and gave her $1,000 toward travel expenses for the trip, but not room and board or treatment costs, Bond said. And in the past week, she said, the church was questioning the cost of a looming funeral. ""They were concerned with getting us out of their lives, and I guarantee you, the day my son goes, the church will rejoice,"" she said. Since she went public, the Franciscans wrote a letter to Bond telling her they will cover 100 percent of her son's funeral costs -- and added, ""Please advise if there is any additional assistance that the Franciscans can provide to Nathan at this time in connection with his day-to-day expenses and comfort."" The order also has since said it will not take Bond to court for breaching the confidentiality of the agreement. For four years before September, Willenborg was a priest at Our Lady of the Lake church in Ashland, Wisconsin. Bishop Peter Christensen, whose diocese includes the church, said Willenborg was a good priest -- but added, ""Because of his behavior 23 years ago, the community is now suffering."" Nathan will not be going back to the hospital and will die at home, Bond said. She can't afford a part-time nurse to help take care of him in his last days, but said she hopes the church lives up to its word.","Nathan Halbach's father is the priest who baptized him, Henry Willenborg .

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- John Phillip Hernandez and a friend walked into the Collector's Firearms gun store in Houston, Texas, to buy a cache of weapons. Hernandez was wearing sunglasses and a dark T-shirt with the words ""I Am the Scene"" scrawled across the front. It was April 28, 2007. Collector's Firearms was one of two gun stores they visited that day as part of a scheme to arm Mexican cartels across the border, according to federal court documents. Hernandez's friend passed his background checks and did all the buying, prosecutors say. On that spring day, he purchased six weapons, including a quick-firing 7.62-caliber firearm and a favorite cartel weapon, the Bushmaster .223. Within days, ATF investigators say, those weapons were put on the road and funneled into the hands of cartel members. ""The cartels are looking to supply their private armies, and they are coming up with more elaborate, larger schemes,"" said Dewey Webb, the special agent in charge of Houston's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field office. The Houston case offers a glimpse into the underworld of illegal gun trafficking and how Mexican drug cartels find much of their firepower in the United States. Straw purchases are made by people who are legally qualified to buy firearms, but those weapons then make their way into the hands of criminals, authorities said. The daily struggle plays out as drugs flow north and guns and money flow south. At least 55 murders were the result of the gun scheme that began in Houston gun shops, authorities said. Hernandez is at the center of the case, what Houston ATF agents say is one of the largest straw-purchasing schemes they have ever seen. ""He doesn't stand out in a crowd,"" an ATF agent told CNN. ""He's just a regular guy."" The agent asked not to be identified because he's been intricately involved in the investigation of this case. Federal investigators say Hernandez recruited and organized 23 people around Houston. Together the men funneled nearly 340 firearms valued at almost $370,000 to Mexican drug cartels. ATF agents say almost 100 of those weapons have turned up at cartel-related crime scenes in Mexico and Guatemala. Hernandez pleaded guilty in 2009 to making false statements about firearms purchases. He's currently serving an eight-year prison sentence. Of the 23 other people connected to the case, 11 have pleaded guilty for their roles in the gun trafficking scheme. Each was sentenced to less than eight years in prison. Several others struck plea deals and continue to cooperate with federal authorities. What made this group so effective was its ability to appear like ordinary gun buyers. All the men had clean criminal backgrounds, authorities say. It wasn't until the firearms started showing up at violent crime scenes in Mexico that federal investigators started piecing together the magnitude of the case. ATF investigators, cooperating with Mexican authorities, traced the weapons back to various Houston gun shops and started seeing the same names of repeat customers. ""It really surprised us at first that we had this many people linked together,"" said the ATF agent who spoke on condition of anonymity. Federal investigators say Hernandez and his men were reimbursed by the cartels for the money spent on the weapons, and then paid an extra $100 to $200 for each firearm they supplied. The weapons Hernandez purchased himself, according to federal court documents, were used in the kidnapping and murder of a prominent Mexican businessman. Another group of weapons turned up in a shooting known as the ""Acapulco Massacre"" in 2007. Seven people were slaughtered that day, including four police officers. ATF agents say breaking up these networks of straw purchasers in the United States is a key battlefront in the fight against Mexican drug cartels. ""These folks that are out buying these guns, they're just as responsible as the people pulling the trigger and killing people in Mexico,"" said Webb, Houston's top ATF agent.","Guns smuggled to Mexico after sale in Houston-area gun stores .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Participation in government health insurance programs -- particularly those aimed at children -- increased from 2006 to 2007, leading to a decrease in the number of Americans lacking insurance, the U.S. Census Bureau said Tuesday. The Census Bureau says 15.3 percent of Americans lacked health insurance in 2007. Overall, 45.7 million people, or 15.3 percent of U.S. residents, did not have health insurance in 2007, the bureau said in releasing reports on poverty, income and insurance. That represents a decrease from the 2006 level of 47 million, or 15.8 percent. The decrease came as a surprise, as the number of uninsured Americans had been expected to rise for a seventh straight year. It also gives a boost to proponents of expanding government health-care plans such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. In December, President Bush signed legislation that extends SCHIP federal funding through the end of March 2009. That action came after Bush vetoed two congressional attempts to expand the program. In vetoing one of the measures, Bush said the proposed expansion ""moves our country's health-care system in the wrong direction."" The percentages of people covered by private health insurance and by employment-based health insurance both decreased slightly in 2007, the Census numbers showed, although the number of those covered by employment-based insurance, 177.4 million, was not statistically different from 2006. However, the percentage of people, including children, covered by government health insurance programs increased to 27.8 percent in 2007 from 27 percent in 2006. The number of children under 18 without health insurance fell to 11 percent, or 8.1 million -- lower than the 2006 numbers of 11.1 percent and 8.7 million.  See a state-by-state breakdown of uninsured Americans » . Meanwhile, participation in Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income Americans, increased to 13.2 percent and 39.6 million in 2007, up from 12.9 percent and 38.3 million in 2006. Using a three-year average from 2005-2007, data showed that Texas had the highest percentage of uninsured, with 24.4 percent, the bureau said. With 8.3 percent, Massachusetts and Hawaii had the lowest estimates for uninsured rates, according to the Census Bureau, but the two were not statistically different from Minnesota (8.5 percent), Wisconsin (8.8 percent) and Iowa (9.4 percent). Hawaii also did not differ statistically from Maine (9.5 percent), it said. But ""even with the overall drop in uninsured Americans, the 45.7 million uninsured number for 2007 exceeds the combined population of 24 states plus the District of Columbia,"" a group called Families USA said in a written statement. The group says on its Web site it is ""dedicated to the achievement of high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans."" Being uninsured is a stark reality many Americans live with daily. They include Linda Pendleton of Greensboro, North Carolina. Pendleton was unable to afford private coverage when the convenience store where she worked stopped offering insurance to its employees two years ago. It worked out fine, she said, until she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer last month. Unable to work, she moved in with her daughter and her three grandsons. She has applied for Medicaid and disability, but has yet to receive a response. ""So right now I'm trying to pay for everything,"" said her daughter, Randi Sharp. But that's not easy. With two of her sons disabled, Sharp stays at home to care for them. Her eldest son receives disability payments of $632 per month, which supports the family, she said. The father of Sharp's children is supposed to pay support, but ""he up and left and the court can't find him."" Though her monthly rent is $600, Sharp said her landlord has cut her some slack. And she goes to churches for her food and didn't buy her sons school clothes this year, she said. Meanwhile, her mother is so dragged down by her reaction to the chemotherapy that she ""can barely do things for herself,"" Sharp said. And even relatively modest fees threaten to cut short her mother's chemotherapy treatments. ""If I don't give them cash on Thursday, if I don't give them $70, they're not going to see her any more,"" Sharp said. A yard sale over the weekend and trips to the pawn shop have helped. So does cutting back on food. ""There are days I go without even eating for two or three days,"" she said. ""I've exhausted all of our resources."" And while the number of those living without health insurance is down, one economist points out, ""we're still seeing an unraveling of the private health insurance system."" Overall, insurance premiums have continued to rise faster than wages or inflation, putting the squeeze on companies and on individual families, said Elise Gould, an economist at the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute. With 2007 being an economic peak year, ""you'd think some of the economy would have helped our workers,"" she said. ""We're not seeing that."" Another underlying problem, she said, is that people purchase cheaper insurance but often have substandard coverage -- something they often don't find out until they experience a health-care emergency and must pay a large amount out of pocket. Ron Pollack, executive director of Washington-based Families USA, issued a statement saying, ""It is ironic that, at the very time the Bush administration tried to cut back Medicaid and twice vetoed legislation to extend children's health coverage, the public safety net cushioned the loss of employer-sponsored health coverage. It demonstrates the importance that the next president should protect, and not undermine, the public health safety net."" Although the uninsured rate for children living below the federal poverty level decreased to 17.6 percent in 2007 from 19.3 percent in 2006, children in poverty were more likely to be uninsured than all children, the Census numbers showed. Still, the numbers of uninsured children decreased across all ethnic groups. However, people must lack health insurance for a year before being counted as ""uninsured"" by the Census Bureau, meaning the actual number could be higher. In other data, the real median household income increased 1.3 percent nationwide, reaching $50,233, the Census Bureau said. The official poverty rate remained statistically unchanged, although the number slightly increased -- 37.3 Americans lived below the poverty level in 2007, up from 36.5 million in 2006. African-American households had the lowest median income, with $33,916, compared with $54,920 for non-Hispanic white households, the data showed. The median income for Hispanic households was $38,679. Household income rose in the Midwest and South, declined in the Northeast and remained unchanged in the West, the bureau said. As defined by the Office of Management and Budget and updated for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, the Census Bureau put the weighted average poverty threshold for 2007 at $21,203 for a family of four; $26,530 for a family of three; $13,540 for a family of two; and $10,590 for individuals. Working women earned 78 percent of the corresponding male salaries, according to the bureau. Median earnings increased for both men and women following three years of decline.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- When filmmaker Roman Polanski was arrested Saturday in Switzerland, he was on his way to accept an award for Lifetime Achievement at the Zurich Film Festival. Peers of Roman Polanski have praised him for his talent and lamented his arrest. Polanski's friend, Swiss filmmaker Otto Weisser, was among the first to publicly run to his defense. ""This is for me a shock. I am ashamed to be Swiss, that the Swiss is doing such a thing to brilliant fantastic genius, that millions and millions of people love his work,"" Weisser said upon learning the director had been detained by Swiss authorities. ""He's a brilliant guy, and he made a little mistake 32 years ago. What a shame for Switzerland."" By Tuesday, more than 130 heavyweights in the movie industry had taken up Polanski's cause. An online petition has been signed by directors such as Marin Scorsese, Woody Allen and Pedro Almodovar, as well as actors. Studio chief Harvey Weinstein told CNN in a statement: ""We are calling every filmmaker we can to help fix this terrible situation.""  Watch a report on celebrities' feelings about Polanski's arrest » . Roman Polanski first stormed Hollywood with his psychological thriller, ""Rosemary's Baby,"" in 1968. He remains one of the most celebrated directors in Hollywood and the world, despite not having set foot in the United States in more than three decades. ""We stand by and await his release and his next masterwork,"" said Zurich Film Festival Jury President Debra Winger on Monday on behalf of Polanski. Adrien Brody, who Polanski directed in 2002's ""The Pianist,"" had glowing words when it came to his experience working with Polanski. ""If you have the guidance from someone you admire, like Roman Polanski, who not only is a gifted director and actor, but who knows the subject matter and in my opinion the character that I portray, implicitly, then, it's a huge gift,"" Brody said. ""I learned a great deal about film and the process,"" the Academy Award winning actor added. ""I spent six weeks without another actor on the set, just Roman and I and a crew -- and that's, that's a dream come true for an actor. I cherished those memories."" ""He is sweet and very strong and is very, very demanding, in the tradition of an auteur,"" said Sigourney Weaver about being directed by Polanski in 1994's ""Death and the Maiden."" It's a reputation Polanski's earned and maintained, despite his 1977 guilty plea on a statutory rape charge of unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl.  Watch the mixed reaction in Switzerland to Polanski's arrest » . The celebrated director fled the United States and settled in France to escape jail, but by the standards of those in Hollywood, the case is ancient history. ""We hope today that this latest order will be dropped,"" Winger said. ""It is based on a three decade old case that is all but dead, except for a minor technicality."" Matthew Belloni, who has has been following the Polanski case for The Hollywood Reporter's  legal blog, said the outpouring of support from the film industry is not surprising. ""It is a criminal conviction of a terrible crime, but it is something that the industry is willing to look the other way on,"" Belloni said. ""If Hollywood really gets to look at itself and judge the personal character of a lot of the artists in the community, there would be a lot of empty seats at the Oscars because a lot of people have personal problems. This sort of is at the extreme level of that."" As Polanski's star rose after his Oscar-winning hit, ""Rosemary's Baby,"" the world got to know the director's back story. He was the son of Polish Jews whose mother died in a concentration camp even as a young Polanski escaped the Nazis. Polanski grew up to become a famous director and married  actress Sharon Tate. He later became the object of national sympathy when Tate was murdered by the Charles Manson Family in 1969. His next big movie, 1974's ""Chinatown,"" was nominated for 11 Oscars. That success gave Hollywood its heroic tag line for Polanski: Tragic survivor moves on. Actors from his films said they have felt a certain empathy as they are directed by him. ""Roman was one of those poor Krakow ghetto children who had to hide in the latrine,"" said Sir Ben Kingsley, who starred with Weaver in ""Death and the Maiden."" Brody hailed Polanski for his survival, even in the face of being separated from his parents and losing his mother at Auschwitz. ""He survived alone, basically, in hiding,"" Brody said. ""It's one of the many things I feel he's overcome, and what's wonderful about Roman is that although he's experienced some tragic things in his life, he also has this unbroken spirit."" After the rape case, American authorities sought his arrest, but he continued to work around the world on movies such as ""Tess"" and ""The Ninth Gate,"" traveling to film festivals and movie sets. But it was in 2002 when Polanski rocketed back onto the public stage, with ""The Pianist."" The Holocaust film won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, igniting a buzz culminating in three Oscars in 2003, including best actor for Brody and best director for Polanski. Harrison Ford accepted the award in his absence. The crowd at the Kodak Theater roared. The Hollywood Reporter's Belloni explained Hollywood's readiness to forgive. ""Look at some of the people who have been involved with scandals,"" Belloni said. "" ""Everyone from Michael Vick, who is now playing football again, to Mel Gibson, who has been involved in a lot of scandals, now he's working again. America is a very, very forgiving culture, and Hollywood itself. If you are a talent, the industry is willing in many ways to look the other way."" And the industry isn't alone in wanting to put the past aside. Polanski's victim, Samantha Geimer, told CNN's Larry King in 2003 that she wished the story and the case had ended soon after it began three decades ago. ""The publicity was so traumatic and so horrible his punishment was secondary to just getting this whole thing to stop,"" Geimer said. ""It was crazy. I never wanted him to go to jail.""","Some industry heavy hitters support Roman Polanski after his arrest .

"(CNN) -- A lawyer who left a videotape saying Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom would be responsible if anything happened to him masterminded his own death last year, a special United Nations commission said Tuesday after an eight-month investigation. Colom had nothing to do with the killing, said Carlos Castresana, head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. ""Rodrigo Rosenberg, for some reason, decided to put an end to his life,"" Castresana said at a televised news conference. Rosenberg was shot from behind in a brazen daylight attack while riding his bicycle in Guatemala City, the nation's capital. He was shot three times in the head, once in the neck and once in the back, Castresana said. Prominent Guatemalan brothers Francisco Jose Valdez Paiz and Jose Estuardo Valdez Paiz hired hit men at the behest of Rosenberg, who told them he was being threatened by someone, Castresana said. The two brothers, who own a pharmaceutical company, had been cousins of Rosenberg through a previous marriage and did not know that he was the target of the assassination, Castresana said. Rosenberg fed information to the hit squad leader that led to his own death, giving descriptions of what the target looked like and where he would be. ""It was the two brothers and no one else,"" Castresana said. ""Not a politician. Not a [government] minister. Not a police chief. No one. Just these two brothers."" About 300 investigators from 11 nations reached their conclusion after an exhaustive examination of 100,000 telephone calls, 9,500 documents, surveillance videotapes, and 135 interviews with 11 suspects and others, Castresana said. Colom had maintained since the May 10 slaying that he was innocent despite Rosenberg's explosive videotape, which was made public the day after his death. Guatemalan authorities have arrested 11 men on suspicion that they carried out the killing, but the Valdez Paiz brothers remain at large. Their lawyer, Alexis Calderon, denied last week that his clients were involved. ""This is a story being made up to implicate people who didn't have anything to do with it,"" Calderon said. He also said that he did not know where the brothers were but that they would surrender after Tuesday's conference. Calderon did not answer calls seeking comment Tuesday. Arrest warrants for the brothers were issued December 10, Castresana said, noting that the suspects were already out of the country by then. Rosenberg recorded the tape blaming Colom three days before his death. He said Colom wanted him dead because the lawyer had been blaming the president and some of his top associates for the slaying of a prominent businessman and his daughter the previous month. Businessman Khalid Musa and his daughter, Marjorie, were killed, Rosenberg said, because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted. Rosenberg was Musa's attorney. Castresana indicated Rosenberg staged his own killing to get back at Colom and high-level members of his government, whom he could not prove were responsible for the Musa killings. ""He wanted to open a box of lightning and thunder,"" said Castresana, a Spanish judge. Castresana pointed to several indicators of Rosenberg's state of mind: His mother had died; he was going through a second divorce, and his wife had taken their young children to Mexico; he was bereft at the slaying of Marjorie Musa, with whom he had a close relationship; and he felt a sense of powerlessness because he could not prosecute the people he believed were responsible for the Musa slayings. May 10, the date of his killing, was Mother's Day. In two April 21 e-mails, seven days after the Musa killings, Rosenberg wrote, ""I can't stop crying"" and ""I feel like I'm disintegrating,"" Castresana said. Rosenberg made out his last will and testament on April 24 and started going public with his accusations against Colom regarding the Musa slayings on May 3. On May 4, he called a meeting at his law office and said he would be leaving the firm, in which he was a partner. The next day, Castresana said, Rosenberg asked a friend to buy two cell phones anonymously. Those cell phones, the lead investigator said, were crucial to cracking the case. Rosenberg used one of the phones to call threats to his personal cell phone and had the other delivered to the Valdez Paiz brothers, who gave it to the hit squad leader. Rosenberg then used the new cell phone he kept to give instructions to the hit squad leader through the second phone, Castresana said. Castresana detailed how the slaying apparently was meant to be paid through a $40,000 check. According to the investigator, Rosenberg told his secretary before his death that she would be receiving a check from Panama that should be delivered to the Valdez Paiz brothers. The check had been made out by Luis Alejos, a Rosenberg friend and business associate who at the time was Guatemala's minister of communication, Castresana said. Alejos resigned from office in June, a few weeks after the slaying. After receiving the check, Francisco Jose Valdez Paiz destroyed it, Castresana said. The businessman paid the 300,000 quetzales ($35,900) for the assassination out of his own pocket, Castresana said. The investigator said Rosenberg sent Alejos the money to pay for the killing. Alejos is the brother of Roberto Alejos, the president of the Guatemalan Congress, and a cousin of Gustavo Alejos, who is President Colom's private secretary. In his videotape, Rosenberg said Gustavo Alejos would be among those responsible for the lawyer's death if it happened. ""If you are reading this message, it means that I, Rodrigo Rosenberg Marzano, was murdered by the president's private secretary, Gustavo Alejos, and his associate Gregorio Valdez, with the approval of Mr. Alvaro Colom and [first lady] Sandra de Colom,"" Rosenberg said. After the tape surfaced, Colom went on national TV with a vehement denial that he or anyone mentioned in the video was involved. He expressed his sense of vindication in a televised speech Tuesday afternoon. ""I don't have any rancor in my heart,"" Colom said. ""Just immense gratitude for those who waited patiently with us."" The United Nations established the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala in 2006 to investigate corruption and political violence. More than 200,000 people have been killed in the nation since 1970, mostly as a result of organized crime, drug-trade violence and a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996. There were 6,451 slayings in Guatemala last year, of which only 230 verdicts were achieved, Castresana said. That means, he said, that more than 96 percent of the killings in 2009 were not solved.","NEW: President expresses feeling of vindication at findings .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- It so rarely snows in Mobile, Alabama, that the city's public works department doesn't bother keeping road salt on hand. So with 2 to 4 inches of snow expected to fall there starting Thursday afternoon, road crews were filling trucks with the sand that's typically reserved for filling cave-ins and for sandbagging during floods. ""We don't know what to do,"" said John Windley, Mobile's superintendent of public works. ""We just tell everybody to stay home."" As forecasters predict up to 8 inches of snow across a swath of the Southeast that hasn't seen more than an inch of snow in at least a decade -- including parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi -- public officials are reacting with a mix of trepidation and helplessness. Hundreds of flights into and out of Atlanta have been canceled for Friday as snow bears down on the area. Texas struggles; East starts to dig out . Delta Air Lines canceled about 800 flights into and out of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, and AirTran Airways canceled 32 flights ahead of the storm, according to representatives of the airlines. Downtown Atlanta could get as much as 5 inches of snow Friday, beginning at mid-morning, according to CNN weather modeling. Many residents of the Deep South, meanwhile, are expressing disbelief. ""I'm dubious,"" said John Hogan, a college professor who's planning to lead a Mardi Gras parade in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Friday night despite forecasts of up to 2 inches of snow and ice there. ""It snows here once every 15 years, so what's the likelihood?"" John DeMiller, owner of the Petit Bois Grocery in Biloxi, Mississippi, was also skeptical. iReport: Share your winter weather pictures, stories . ""To be honest, we don't believe it's going to snow,"" he said. ""It just never does."" Yet it was already snowing in parts of the South by Thursday afternoon and forecasters were calling for more to come. The storm system moving across the Deep South in the next few days will bring 3 to 6 inches of snow to Jackson, Mississippi, up to 2 inches to Biloxi, Mississippi and 2 to 4 inches to Mobile, Alabama, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. ""These are cities that rarely see a flake all winter long,"" he said. With most of the accumulation expected overnight, school and workplaces across the region are bracing for closures Friday. Because temperatures are expected to rise into the 30s and 40s across much of the South on Friday, road crews are worried about melting and refreezing on roads over the next couple of days. A representative of the Federal Aviation Administration said the agency is too focused on responding to the double-punch of Northeast snow to say how the expected Southern snow would affect travel in the region. But by Thursday night, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport had already measured a snowfall of 9.4 inches, which broke the record of 7.8 inches set on January 14, 1917, and matched on January 15, 1964, the National Weather Service reported. In Shreveport, Louisiana, where snow had been falling since dawn, the staff at the Naked Bean Cafe said it had only six customers by noon, down from around 30 on a typical day.","Forecasters predict up to 8 inches of snow across a swath of the Southeast .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A Kurdish member of Iraq's parliament said Monday that the United States is pressuring the ""highest levels of the Kurdish leadership"" to accept a compromise that would dictate how national elections would be held in January. Mahmoud Othman said the United States urged the Kurdish majority in the northern oil-rich province of Kirkuk to agree to a proposal that would settle issues about the law that spells out how the election will be carried out. Vice President Joe Biden broached the issue of elections in telephone calls Sunday with Iraqi Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani and Speaker of the Parliament Ayad al-Samarrai'e, said Biden spokesman Jay Carney. ""In both calls, the vice president echoed the president's position that timely elections are important and that we urge all parties to do their part to make them happen,"" he said. A secure environment and political stability during and after the polls will be key as the United States looks to withdraw combat troops by August, leaving 50,000 in advisory roles, and then withdraw all U.S. forces by the end of 2011. Some Kurds have complained that the U.S. proposals would favor the province's Arabs and Turkmen, though it was not clear on what they based that assertion. Kurds have long regarded Kirkuk as an integral part of Kurdistan, and many want to be part of Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region. Arabs and Turkmen have their claims to the city, and all the groups want their voices and votes to be fairly represented in the political system. Provincial elections that were to have been held in January were postponed indefinitely because officials there could not agree on how to apportion seats among the ethnic groups. Last week, the Kurds threatened to boycott voting on the election law, thereby threatening to delay the election itself, which is scheduled to take place January 16. The constitution would allow for a delay, but not past January 31. Iraq's election commission has said it needs at least 90 days after passage of any election law to prepare to carry out elections, which U.S. and Iraqi government officials call a vital step in Iraqi efforts to solidify a democratic system in the post-Saddam Hussein era. The head of Iraq's Independent High Electoral Commission, Judge Qassim Aboodi, said Monday that if the law is not passed within a few days, the elections could be threatened altogether. Othman described the U.S. efforts at pushing forward a compromise to the Kurds as being ""counterproductive"" and ""making things worse."" Though the proposal was submitted by the United Nations, Othman said, ""the U.S. is behind this."" He said the U.S.-backed plan was not fair and urged that U.S. officials remain neutral. Under Saddam's regime, Kurds were kicked out of Kirkuk, and many Arabs moved in, a policy called Arabization. But Kurds returned to the city in droves after the regime was toppled. Sharp disagreements exist over which voter registries should be used in the elections, with the Kurds wanting a current one and the Arabs and Turkmen wanting registries from several years ago. As for the lists, politicians disagree over the use of open lists that name candidates and closed lists that name parties. The law used in the 2005 election calls for a closed list. U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Christopher Hill and Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. officials in Iraq, issued a statement Thursday urging lawmakers to decide that ""rules, procedures, and decisions"" for the election apply only to that vote. They argue that it should not set precedent ""for future political settlements related to Article 140, demographic change, disputed boundaries, or other contested issues,"" a specific reference to the Kirkuk question. Article 140 is the section of the country's constitution referencing the issue. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this story from Baghdad, Iraq.","Member of parliament says U.S. pushing for agreement on election law .

"Washington (CNN) -- More than 200 federal, state and local law enforcement personnel have been assigned to an operation intended to find who was responsible for Saturday's fatal shootings of three people linked to the U.S. consulate in Cuidad Juarez, Mexico, an official said. Among the agencies involved in Operation Knock Down -- taking place in southern New Mexico and in the vicinity of El Paso, Texas -- are the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, said DEA spokesman David Ausiello. El Paso is across the Rio Grande from Ciudad Juarez. A law enforcement official said investigators believe that there could be a connection between Barrio Azteca, a gang that operates in both cities, and the killings. The official said that mistaken identity has not been ruled out. A relative of U.S. consulate worker Lesley Ann Enriquez said Wednesday that the 35-year-old woman was four months pregnant with a boy when she was shot dead. Enriquez's husband, 34-year-old Arthur Redelfs, was also killed. He was a 10-year veteran of the El Paso County Sheriff's Office. The couple was fired on in their SUV as they left a birthday party at the U.S. consulate. Their 7-month-old daughter, Rebecca, who was in the back of the SUV, was unhurt. A third victim, who had also left the party, was identified as Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, 37, a state police officer who was married to a Mexican employee of the U.S. consulate. His wife was not traveling with him, but two of their children, ages 4 and 7, were in the car and were wounded, officials said. ""We have all come together to find Barrio Azteca members as part of a major intelligence effort,"" said Andrea Simmons, a public information officer for the FBI in El Paso. In addition to the FBI and the DEA, other organizations involved are the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the El Paso Police Department, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office and the Texas Department of Public Safety. ""Part of this is being done to generate leads regarding the ongoing investigation in Juarez as well as an opportunity to gather information on the location of Eduardo Ravelo, one of the top 10 fugitives,"" she said. The FBI is offering $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of Ravelo, who is accused of being a leader of Barrio Azteca. This week, Mexican President Felipe Calderon made his third visit in slightly more than a month to Ciudad Juarez. Its more than 2,600 drug-related deaths last year made it the most violent city in Mexico. No official numbers are available, but more than 400 killings have been reported in local media this year.

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- Thousands of people joined world leaders in the German capital Monday to remember the night 20 years ago when a euphoric wave of people power swept away the Berlin Wall and consigned the Cold War to history. In scenes calmly mirroring the events of November 9, 1989, crowds thronged through the center of the once-divided city, joining German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a symbolic re-enactment of the first crossing of the breached Wall. ""It was worth fighting for,"" Merkel said, after crossing the Bösebrücker bridge on Bornholmer Strasse, the checkpoint where people first poured across the frontier. Merkel, the first former East German to lead the reunified country, was accompanied by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Polish ex-president Lech Walesa as she kicked off events to celebrate the demise of the iconic structure and remember the darker sides of the communist regimes behind it. ""It is not only a day of celebration for Germans. It is a day of celebration for the whole of Europe,"" Merkel said. Merkel was joined by Britain's Gordon Brown, France's Nicolas Sarkozy and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in a series of events, including solemn tributes and boisterous music concerts. At the climax, a line of 1,000 giant dominoes was knocked over along a 2-kilometer strip where the Wall once stood --representing the domino effect the structure's collapse had in ending communism across Eastern Europe. Memorials were to be held for the 136 lives lost of those who tried to eascape through the barrier that cut Berlin in two -- many in the so-called ""death strip"" at the heart of the Wall's fortifications. Read more in our Autumn of Change special report . Thousands of people gathered at the Brandenburg Gate, the symbol of reunified Germany which once stood at the center of the no man's land between East and West Berlin. Rock acts including Bon Jovi joined the festivities, echoing the popular music of the late 80s which soundtracked the cold night when rigid communist control gave way to an exhilarating tide of people clamoring for freedom. Testament to the powerful legacy of the Wall's collapse have been the vivid memories recounted by many of the dramatic and emotional events before and after the fall. ""It was a circus-like atmosphere, people were enthused and exuberant and thrilled to see the Wall coming down,"" said David Paul Noel of Maryland, who was working for the U.S. State Department in Germany at the time. Former CNN correspondent Richard Blystone, who watched the Wall collapse was struck by the difference in appearance of each side of the Wall . ""On the west side, there was all this graffiti and dirty words, and names of rock groups and 'down with that' -- all the chaos of a pluralistic society,"" he said. ""On the eastern side, it was clean and white, just so sterile."" Though dominated by nostalgia, Monday was also an opportunity to assess progress in a reunified Germany and democratized Eastern Europe, with many airing concerns that the world still has lessons to learn from the events of 1989. With many in Germany feeling the economic, social and psychological divisions once demarcated by the Wall, Merkel said Monday that the country had yet to fulfil promises made when East and West reunited in 1990. ""Germany unity is not yet complete,"" Merkel told public broadcaster ARD earlier. At an event in Berlin on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for renewed global action to liberate those still living under repressive regimes. ""Our history did not end the night the Wall came down,"" Clinton said. ""It began anew. And this matters not only to tens of millions of Europeans, and to the United States, but to people everywhere."" She added: ""To expand freedom to more people, we cannot accept that freedom does not belong to all people. We cannot allow oppression, defined and justified by religion or tribe to replace that of ideology. ""We have a responsibility to address conditions everywhere that undermine the potential of boys and girls and men and women that sap human dignity and threaten global progress.""

"(CNN) -- Haiti's infrastructure was among the world's worst even in the best of times, the country's ambassador to the United States said Tuesday. ""It was a catastrophe waiting to happen,"" Raymond Alcide Joseph told CNN from Washington shortly after a 7.0 earthquake leveled parts of his home country, cutting power and phone lines in the capital city of Port-au-Prince. ""Sadly, it has happened."" He called the result ""a catastrophe of major proportions."" The capital city is surrounded by hills to which ""little flimsy houses"" were struggling to hold on, he said. Frank Williams of World Vision Haiti told CNN from the Petionville section of the capital that the building in which his organization is based shook for about 35 seconds and did not weather it well. Learn more about Haiti, poorest nation in Americas . ""Portions of things on the building fell off,"" he said. ""Fortunately for us, our building remains standing and none of our staff were injured, but lots of walls are falling down. Many of our staff have tried to leave, but were unsuccessful because the walls from buildings and private residences were falling into the streets."" In the capital, government buildings were damaged, phone service was spotty and electricity was out, except for people who had emergency generators, Williams said. The quake's impact also shook the psyches of residents, particularly when aftershocks occurred, he said. ""If there is another aftershock, there is a kind of wail as people are very frightened by it,"" Williams said. ""But most people are out in the streets and just kind of looking up."" Joseph said he had spoken with Secretary-General Fritz Longchamps, who told him buildings collapsed on either side of him as he walked along a street in Petionville. Catholic Relief Services, international relief agency based in Baltimore, spoke briefly with their person in charge in Port-au-Prince before the line went dead. Regional Information Officer Robyn Feiser said the representative told them ""it's a total disaster."" She quotes him as saying, ""I never felt anything like this. It was a major hit, and it was direct."" He told Robin their building was shaking but still standing, but the building across the street from them collapsed. He described a cloud of dust everywhere, and people moving into courtyards to get away from buildings. Eighty percent of Haiti's 9 million residents live under the poverty line and more than half -- 54 percent -- live in abject poverty, according to the CIA Factbook. In 2008, four tropical storms damaged the transportation infrastructure and agricultural sector, on which two-thirds of Haitians depend, mainly as subsistence farmers. Citing that World Bank assessment, the Organization of American States said in a report on its Web site, ""Among the numerous factors explaining the extent of the loss of lives and goods are the absence of land use zoning and building guidelines, and comprehensive enforcement mechanisms."" The OAS report added Haiti has no national building codes. Former U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Timothy M. Carney told CNN that Port-au-Prince was particularly at risk because it grew rapidly from a population of about 250,000 in the mid-1950s to more than 2 million today, all with little oversight. City planners had called for the surrounding hills to remain undeveloped in order to protect an aquifer. ""That didn't happen,"" Carney said. ""People started building up those hillsides."" Instead of building concrete structures, they built shanties, he said. ""My fear is that they all fell down.""","Haitian ambassador to U.S.: Infrastructure of island nation poor in best of times .

"(CNN) -- Sevilla have sacked coach Manolo Jimenez after their disappointing home draw to bottom-club Xerez on Tuesday extended the club's winless run to seven games. Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had ""done what I had to."" He told the club's official Web site: ""It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. ""Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible. However it is obvious that he could not get a response out of the team. ""Fortunately we believe that there is time. The growth and the ambition of the club is shown in the change of the manager. We are fighting for important things."" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February. Ironically, it is Mallorca who occupy the much-coveted fourth spot in the table that guarantees Champions League football next season. Jimenez took charge in October 2007 when former coach Juande Ramos left to take over at English Premier League team Tottenham. In that season he led Sevilla to a fifth-place finish, while in 2009 they came third in the league behind Real Madrid and Barcelona. Rodriguez said a new manager would be in place for Sunday's game with Villarreal. ""The matter will be resolved as soon as possible and he [the new manager] will be sitting on the bench for Sundays match,"" he added.","Sevilla sack coach Manolo Jimenez .

"(CNET) -- When it comes to 3D television, I don't see it. Literally. The technology that's supposed to convince me that a 3D image exists when I look at a 2D screen doesn't work for me. Nor does it work for a small but significant percentage of the population -- 4 percent to 10 percent, depending on which expert you ask. Me, and millions of people like me, are being left behind by content and hardware companies as they move to 3D. I don't mean to complain. It's not the end of the world. Flat-viewers, like me, can watch 2D versions of 3D content. I saw ""Avatar"" in the non-3D version. As a bonus, the theater was nearly empty--the 3D showing down the hall was more crowded. Plus, we didn't have to wear those dorky glasses. Of course, we are social beings, and not being able to view 3D means that group or family outings to 3D showings are awkward for the flat viewers, who may have to sit through a showing that will cause headaches or just look bad to them. But the flat-viewer's experience with 3D imagery can vary. While I find viewing 3D imagery uncomfortable, Daniel Terdiman, another person at CNET who can't see 3D, saw the 3D version of Avatar and wore the 3D glasses. It looked fine to him, just not 3D. Manufacturers are mute . At CES this year, the trend toward 3D in home television sets was unmissable, but there was no mention by the manufacturers of how this move would affect flat viewers. I was curious how the hardware companies, which fight for every point of market share jealously, could cavalierly ignore the large number of us who won't like this new direction. It's a lot of market. How are they planning to deal with losing it? Oddly, none of the HDTV manufacturing companies I reached out to could provide a direct comment on this topic, but I did talk with people familiar with the industry and with an optometrist who has a vested interest in promoting the growth of 3D content viewing. Bruce Berkoff of the LCDTV Association and formerly a marketing executive at LG, noted that for all the hype around 3D, the television manufacturers are not really investing much in putting products on store shelves, nor are they expecting consumers to pay for it yet. Adding the capability for televisions to display alternating images for stereoscopic viewing through electronic shutter glasses is not expensive. It's the glasses themselves that are, and only a few 3D-capable sets actually come bundled with them. So consumers will be able to soon buy televisions ready for 3D without spending much. Berkoff, and everyone else I talked to about 3D TV, reminded me that a good 3D TV is also a good 2D TV. You should be able to turn off the 3D display features and view content designed specifically for 3D but in 2D: You just show the view for only one eye. If the refresh rate of the program is high enough, you should not notice much of a difference in picture quality. Get your eyes examined . From the optometrist's perspective, the inability to process stereoscopic imagery is, for many people, a treatable condition. Dr. Brad Habermehl, president of the College of Optometrists in Vision Development, told me, ""You don't have to be a 3D refugee if you get to the root of the problem. The majority of stereo-blind people really can be helped."" Habermehl says that there are methods to teach people to see in 3D. Using graduated methods and physical aids (lenses) as ""training wheels,"" he says, people can eventually learn how to ""point both eyes to focus on the same space."" It's like riding a bike. Once you learn, the training wheels come off and you can't imagine not doing it. ""Vision is definitely learned,"" he says. ""That's what vision training is."" The doctor sounded to me suspiciously like a spokesperson for the 3D television manufacturers, or at least a recipient of some marketing dollars from them. But he's not. ""It would be nice if they would fund us,"" he said. But after reminding me that ""Avatar"" had already made $1 billion in box office receipts, he added, ""I don't think the industry is worried about this."" Personally, I have no interest in undergoing medical treatment just so I can spend more money on consumer electronics. Although Dr. Oliver Sacks, in a compelling New Yorker article, did make me wonder what my kind is missing. And regardless of whether you see in 3D or not, the technology is inexorably changing the visual language of movies and television shows. When directors create shows for 3D, they can't rely on cinematic methods viewers are used to in 2D for conveying action, depth, and movement. Hard cuts and swooping camera moves can disorient viewers new to 3D. The new standard of practice is to lock down the camera and move the action around it, instead of the reverse, which is the case in today's 2D movies. Good 3D movies today will appear subtly more stately and cinematic than 2D shows. The future of the 3D feature . For all the hype at CES, 3D for the next few years is likely to be a ""feature"" in the new crop of TVs, according to Gary Merson of the HDGuru3D site. ""It's not black-and-white to color,"" Merson says. ""It's a feature, like Internet connectivity and stereo."" He also points out that the content is not there yet, and that many consumers have only recently upgraded their tube televisions to HD flat screens. For people like me, for whom the world is flat, this feature can not roll out slowly enough. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"Central Falls, Rhode Island (CNN)  -- The teacher at an embattled Rhode Island school who displayed an effigy of President Obama in his classroom is under disciplinary review, according to the school superintendent. The Obama effigy was an apparent protest of the president's support of mass firings of the school's teachers. Its existence was first reported on CNN.com on Thursday. An Obama doll, about a foot tall, hung by its feet from a white board; the doll held a sign that said, ""Fire Central Falls teachers."" Superintendent Frances Gallo discovered the item late Monday at Central Falls High School after being asked about a rumor about an Obama doll hung by his feet in a classroom. Gallo took it upon herself to investigate and found the effigy Monday night. ""It was obviously imprudent on [the teacher's] part, very ill-conceived and nothing to fool around with,"" Gallo said. Bold superintendent hated, loved . The superintendent said the teacher was contrite when confronted but said it was ""a joke to him."" Due to union contract stipulations, Gallo said she could not disclose the name of the teacher. Gallo said it was difficult to comprehend how a teacher could not ""understand that a class full of children are very offput by such a 'joke.' ""He doesn't see it as making a mockery or, worse, just total disrespect,"" Gallo said. ""Clearly, he wasn't thinking."" She said the matter is under disciplinary review and has been sent to Rhode Island State Police. State police have not returned phone calls seeking comment. The local teachers union condemned the act Thursday. ""Simply put, the teacher's actions were wrong and cannot be condoned under any circumstances,"" Jane Sessums, president of the Central Falls Teachers Union, said in a written statement. ""The teacher has apologized verbally to his students and has asked Superintendent Frances Gallo for permission to apologize to them in writing. He understands that his actions affect not just his students but all of us. There is no excuse for what he did."" A source, whom CNN is not naming because of the sensitive nature of the story, said the teacher is a beloved member of the faculty who has done a tremendous amount of good over the years. Many of the students in the class are immigrants who hold Obama in high regard; they were learning English as a second language, according to the source. Central Falls High School has been at the center of an educational firestorm in recent weeks after all 93 teachers, support staff and administrators were fired for the low performance of the school. Gallo took the drastic action after talks with union leaders fell through. The firings will go into effect at the end of the school year. Teachers can re-apply, but no more than 50 percent will get rehired. The high school has been failing for the past seven years. Its graduation rate stands around 48 percent. Math proficiency is at 7 percent. Reading scores have improved by 21 percentage points in the past two years but still fall far behind, with 55 percent able to read at grade level, according to school officials. Most of the 800 students at Central Falls are Hispanic. For many, English is a second language. Teachers say the population is so transient that the statistics are a skewed and unfair representation of the students' smarts and the teachers' skills. Animosity toward Obama built among teachers after the president endorsed the school's plans for reform. Marcia Reback, president of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers, said last week that teachers were peeling Obama bumper stickers off their cars. ""When the president of the United States celebrates a superintendent of schools for mass firing an entire faculty of teachers, then that is saying something about his attitude toward teachers,"" she said. ""And it's not a healthy attitude.""","Obama effigy found in classroom at troubled Rhode Island school .

"London, England (CNN) -- UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has ordered a full review of security measures at UK airports following the attempted Detroit plane bombing on December 25. In a statement published Friday on the prime minister's official Web site, Brown said the UK government will be working with the U.S. to ""examine a range of new techniques to enhance airport security systems beyond traditional measures, such as pat-down searches and sniffer dogs."" These new measures might include using ""explosive trace technology, full body scanners and advanced x-ray technology."" Writing on the first day of a new decade, Brown issued a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by international terrorism. ""The new decade,"" he said, ""is starting as the last began -- with al Qaeda creating a climate of fear. These enemies of democracy and freedom... are concealing explosives in ways which are more difficult to detect."" The Detroit incident highlighted an ""urgent"" need to tighten airport security measures, Brown said. ""The UK,"" Brown said, ""will continually explore the most sophisticated devices capable of identifying explosives, guns, knives and other such items anywhere on the body."" The alleged plane bomber, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab is believed to have concealed explosives in his underwear. The 23-year-old Nigerian is thought to have linked up with an al Qaeda group based in Yemen after attending the UK's University College London. Brown said the plot was a reminder of al Qaeda's increasing influence away from ""better-known homes of international terror such as Pakistan and Afghanistan."" Yemen is becoming ""a major new base for terrorism"" which highlighted the need for ""enhanced cooperation"" between nations in the fight against international terrorism, he said. Brown added that the UK government is already supporting the government of Yemen's efforts to tackle terrorism and pledged further support. ""By 2011 our already announced commitment to Yemen will exceed £100 million ($160 million), making the UK one of its leading donors,"" he said. It was also announced Friday that Brown had invited ""key international partners"" to a meeting in London at the end of January to discuss how to counter radicalization in Yemen. ""We have already updated our counter-terrorism strategy to include further measures to disrupt al Qaeda's leadership and frustrate its attempts to recruit, train and direct a new generation of terrorists or to find a new haven for those leaders displaced by the efforts of our Afghan and Pakistani allies."" The key to tackling terrorism was ""vigilance"" Brown said, but the Detroit incident was ""a wake-up call...not just for security against terror but for the hearts and minds of a generation.""","UK Prime Minister orders a full review of airport security following failed Detroit plane bomb plot .

"New York (CNN) -- Israel's government is missing an opportunity to secure the country's future and build a coalition of nations to counter increasing Iranian influence, according to analyst Fareed Zakaria. He says the government, headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is letting the dispute with the United States over expanded settlements in East Jerusalem get in the way of making progress toward resolution of the conflict with the Palestinians. ""The Netanyahu government goes on and on about the existential threat that Israel faces from Iran, the need for the world to mobilize, to put that above all else,"" Zakaria said. ""If that really is the case, shouldn't Israel try to be supportive and deepen the relationship with the one country whose military, political and economic support is going to be absolutely crucial in dealing with this threat, that is, the United States? ""If the Iranian threat were really the overriding threat to Israel, wouldn't it be willing to subordinate other issues and make some progress on the Palestinian issue because it would help the moderate Arab states who also share the worries about the rise of Iran, and would allow the moderate Arab states to form a kind of tacit alliance with Israel?"" Zakaria, author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" spoke to CNN on Wednesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: In your view, how badly have U.S.-Israeli relations been damaged by the announcement of the East Jerusalem settlement expansion? Fareed Zakaria: I think by itself this would be a small friction that could easily be overcome, but it comes on the heels of increasingly tense relations between Washington and Tel Aviv, and because of that, it has become larger than life precisely because it seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back for the Obama administration. It became a symbol for the fact that in their view, the Netanyahu government is simply not trying to be cooperative in the search for some kind of movement forward on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. CNN: And why do they feel that way? Zakaria: They have been trying to get the Netanyahu government to do something concrete that would demonstrate that they are interested in moving forward, whether it is direct talks, whether it's a settlement freeze or any other such signal that would allow the process to begin moving forward rather than to stay where it is. So far, the Netanyahu government has done nothing like that, and in fact has taken several steps that would make it difficult to enter into direct negotiations. ... He has within his coalition members of the orthodox right in Israel who still very much hold to a view that the Jewish state should be on most, if not all, of the land of greater Israel, which includes the West Bank. ...This government has probably been the least responsive to concerns from Washington on the issue of the peace process in 20 years. CNN: The so-called proximity peace talks were delayed as a result of this dispute? Is that a real step backward? Zakaria: The whole problem with the peace process is that it's sort of going around in circles. I myself think the proximity talks are themselves almost like a bad joke. They're not actually going to talk to one another. The American negotiator is going to shuttle back and forth between them. We're in 2010. If everyone agrees that there's going to be a two-state solution and we kind of know what the plan is going to look like, roughly -- which is to say the plan that was largely agreed upon by the two parties in 2000 under the auspices of Bill Clinton -- we are now going back to the most tentative steps of circling around each other, barely talking to one another. It's as if we're at the beginning of a negotiating process when really we should be at the end of one ... CNN: You've laid out the obstacles on the Israeli side. Are there obstacles on the Palestinian side too? Zakaria: There are huge obstacles on the Palestinian side: First of all, the divided Palestinian authority -- Hamas being in charge in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority in charge on the West Bank. There is the reality that Hamas is still not reconciled to the idea of a Jewish state. There is the reality of the corruption and perhaps the lack of legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority. But one would have to say that these problems have existed for a long time, and it's not clear to me that these problems have gotten worse. In fact, the Palestinian Authority is better functioning than it has ever been under Salam Fayyad, the prime minister. There is greater control over the territory by the Palestinian Authority. There is less of a problem of terrorism, a more serious effort to build from the ground up a modern state ... and there have been some very small hints from the Hamas leadership that they would be willing to accept the state of Israel. It's not nearly enough, but the point is, if there's been any movement, it has not been movement backward in the Palestinian case. CNN: On the Israeli side, what's the significance of expanding the settlements in East Jerusalem? Zakaria: There are religious parties in Israel who want to create facts on the ground [that] make it more and more difficult to trade land for peace. It's also an indication that the broader Israeli public has sort of lost interest in the resolution of the Palestinian problem. I think that many see the wall as essentially ending the problem of terrorism. The Israeli public as a whole has moved right and there is a collective belief that Israel can simply kick this can down the road and deal with the problem later. I think it's short-sighted, in terms of demographics, regional politics, in terms of the technology of terrorism, pushing this problem away when there will be more Palestinians with the potential for being more radicalized, perhaps a greater international coalition arrayed against Israel. It doesn't seem to be a far-sighted way to secure Israel. Israel is basically succeeding brilliantly in the economic realm ... in many ways, it is even more productive than European countries. It is a technological superstar. What it needs is political stability and to resolve this problem so it can move even more dramatically forward. But it has a political system where that kind of resolution becomes politically difficult because of many highly reactionary forces within the system. CNN: Is there a way out of this mess? Zakaria: The way out would be for the Israelis to recognize that it is profoundly in their long-term interest to resolve this issue, recognize that they are the stronger party ... and see if there is a possibility of some kind of resolution to get out of the terrible bind it's in. It has 3.5 million people on territory it controls who neither have political rights nor a state of their own. Nor can they be part of Israel. That's a structural reality which is terrible for the Palestinians but also terrible for the Israelis because it undermines Israel as a democratic state.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The nearly 100 children living at an orphanage in Carrefour, Haiti, are hungry and thirsty, and desperately waiting for aid, a member of the orphan's foundation told CNN on Saturday. All of the buildings of the Good Shepherd Orphanage, about eight miles from the capital of Port-au-Prince, were ""damaged beyond repair,"" including the dormitories, said David Zimmer, treasurer for the Good Shepherd Orphanage and Schools Foundation. Zimmer spoke to CNN from Hebron, Kentucky, but said he has been in communication with the head of the orphanage, Pastor Ernst Cassy, who has worked in Carrefour for 40 years. He has also received messages via e-mail from staff in Carrefour, Zimmer said. The news he and his wife have received is heart-wrenching: The roads are impassable, Cassy has run out of food and the well they used to collect drinking water was damaged in Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake.

In the capital on Friday, chaos broke out at the Maison De Lumiere Orphanage after severe shortages of food, water and medicine sparked an outcry, said Mike Maiolo, senior pastor of the volunteers' home church in Mission Viejo, California. The building sustained heavy damage but no one was killed, he said. Many children who had parents on Tuesday morning, were orphans by that night. A doctor told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen on Friday that the number of orphans had tripled after the quake. Zimmer said he plans to fly into Port-au-Prince on Tuesday.

"(CNN)  -- Like most stories that end up with a man mowing his friend's lawn in a dress, it started out innocently enough. Craig Harrell takes a quick break for the camera while fulfilling his end of the bargain. Not long after Robert Klein began working on his man cave, his friend Craig Harrell paid Klein a compliment. He noticed Klein was looking trimmer since they'd last met. As Klein continued to slim down, they made a bet: Whoever could get down to 200 pounds first would be the winner, and the loser would have to mow the winner's yard -- in a dress. Klein started building his man cave in Pasadena, Maryland, so he could have the bar of his dreams and a home theater. He worked on his basement for more than a year and ended up losing 65 pounds in the process -- more than enough to win his bet with Harrell. CNN.com and iReport.com got an overwhelming response when we asked readers to send in photos and stories of their man caves: spaces that foster men's hobbies, decorating skills and technological needs. Some of their stories were so outrageous that we decided to profile a few of them. Klein's man cave, however, was the only one to combine dramatic weight loss and cross-dressing, so we had to give him a call to find out more. Klein said his friends wanted to talk about two things while he was building his man cave: how his amazing bar was coming along and how they thought Harrell would lose the bet. The bet was popular with everyone Klein and Harrell knew. Their wives even started a dress committee, to make sure the loser was appropriately attired, and their kids delighted in the prospect of seeing Dad in a dress. To lose weight, Klein said Harrell played golf and cut out chips, while he adopted a balanced, calorie-restricted diet, and spent at least six hours a day on the man cave, which took most of his free time. Klein did all the electric wiring himself, worked on the framing and put three coats of paint on all the walls and ceilings. He attributes his weight loss success to replacing TV-watching with hard work. ""I lost at least 10 pounds on the painting alone,"" he said. ""My neck was sore for weeks."" Klein knew he couldn't build the kind of man cave he wanted all by himself, so he contracted out some of the big jobs, like cutting a hole in the foundation to add 6-foot-tall French doors to the side of the house in place of a window well, and finding someone to do the woodwork on a custom bar he designed. Although he started out with a carefully planned budget, Klein quickly found he needed to spend more money to make his dreams a reality. The hardest part, he said, was finding someone who could build his bar for a price he could afford. After some disheartening estimates (one was $65,000), Klein found Lyle Delfosse, a local furniture maker who had built libraries in the Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C., and constructed a chair for a U.S. Supreme Court justice over his long career. Now 76 and retired, Delfosse told Klein, ""I can build anything out of wood."" Klein said Delfosse was true to his word, and they didn't go over the initial estimate of $19,000, although he said Delfosse told him ""if he had it to do all over again, he'd have charged double."" Klein calls the bar ""magnificent,"" and said that when people come over to see it, they feel underdressed. Convinced he'd saved money by doing a lot of the work himself, Klein splurged on a new sprinkler system. The bet he'd made earlier in the year was on his mind, and he wanted to ensure that the grass in his front yard would be nice and green once the weigh-in arrived. At the height of summer, Klein's man cave was finished, and he decided it was time to step on the scales. Harrell was 208 pounds, and Klein was 195. At the party Klein threw to show off his new bar and theater, Harrell was ready. With some help from the dress committee, Harrell became Klein's newly acquired, frock-sporting landscaper. The wives had sewn two pink, strapless dresses together to fit Harrell, and then layered on accessories like a bow-topped headband and a corsage. All decked out, Harrell graciously mowed Klein's front yard, with 80 people cheering him on. Somehow, as Harrell was mowing, Klein's new sprinkler system went off, soaking Harrell and his dress. In a phone interview, Klein was coy about who the perpetrator might have been. These days, Harrell has his own man cave, complete with bar. Klein points out that his bar is nicer, but says he's got his buddy's back: Harrell's wife thinks a dishwasher would be a practical addition to the man cave, but Klein is trying to convince her that the keg refrigerator Harrell wants is a good idea.

"(CNN) -- Ireland opened the defense of their Six Nations rugby title with a 29-11 victory at home to Italy, while England repelled the challenge of Wales to win 30-17 in Saturday's other match. Ireland, who won all five matches last year to complete a Grand Slam, led 23-8 at halftime in Dublin but could not run away with victory against a determined visiting team. Recalled flyhalf Ronan O'Gara became the first player to score 500 points in the tournament as he was successful with all six kicks at goal, while Jamie Heaslip and Tomas O'Leary crossed for first-half tries. Italy's only try came just before halftime, despite the sin-binning of center Gonzalo Garcia meaning coach Nick Mallett's team were reduced to 14 men, after a charge-down of Rob Kearney's kick by Kaine Robertson. ""It's not easy to click immediately having only been together for two weeks and not having played together since November,"" Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll told reporters. ""There is plenty to improve on. It's the first one and job done. We'll take the positives out of it and move on. We showed an ability in the first half to turn defense into attack and the amount of lineout ball we won was a big plus. ""We made some good line breaks but didn't finish them off. Maybe we need to improve our support play."" England flanker James Haskell scored two tries to lift the pressure on head coach Martin Johnson, as Wales paid the price for Alun-Wyn Jones' sin-binning with 17 points conceded while the lock was off the field at Twickenham. The match was level at 3-3 when Jones was yellow-carded for leg-tripping England hooker Dylan Hartley, and the hosts subsequently scored a penalty and two converted tries, Haskell's first in Tests and another five minutes after halftime by scrumhalf Danny Care. Wales battled back to 20-17 down with eight minutes left as Jones made some amends by setting up prop Adam Jones for a try and then James Hook crossed for another. But four minutes later Haskell went over again thanks to Delon Armitage's interception, and then Jonny Wilkinson kicked his third penalty, this one from the halfway line to give the flyhalf 15 points for the match. Wales coach Warren Gatland was furious after Jones' indiscipline cost his side dear. ""We are frustrated and disappointed. We felt that was a game that has slipped from our grasp,"" the New Zealander told reporters. ""The yellow card has cost us 17 points -- it was one of those things, stupid. It was massive. Sometimes those things are very, very costly, and it was for us today. ""We had stressed discipline over the past two weeks and talked about giving nothing soft away, and it is frustrating we have done that. He has made an impulsive decision, and hopefully it is a learning experience for him and he doesn't do it again.""

"(CNN) -- Mathieu Bastareaud returned from the international rugby wilderness to score two tries as France opened their Six Nations campaign with an 18-9 victory away to Scotland on Sunday. The center made his first start since being cast aside after fabricating a tale of being assaulted during France's tour of New Zealand in June last year. The 21-year-old crossed for his first five-point scores at the highest level, having made his debut in the 2009 Six Nations before causing controversy when he claimed he had been attacked outside his hotel to explain facial injuries. He later admitted being drunk and falling over a table in his room, but speculation over the incident continued and French sports paper L'Equipe reported that he had psychiatric treatment following a suicide attempt. However, Bastareaud scored the first try of the game in Edinburgh in the 12th minute following a five-meter scrum, and powered over the line again out on the left seven minutes before halftime. Scrumhalf Morgan Parra converted to give France a 15-6 lead and then kicked his second penalty five minutes after the interval. Chris Paterson, playing his 99th international for Scotland, kicked his third penalty to reduce the deficit but the home side never looked like breaching the try line of last year's third-placed team as France could afford to see Parra miss another attempt at goal. Scotland coach Andy Robinson was left to rue defensive lapses ahead of next weekend's trip to Wales, who lost 30-17 to England on Saturday. ""We conceded two soft scores, and if we do that we're not going to beat anybody,"" the Englishman told reporters. ""It was hard against a good French scrum. The French were very canny in what they did."" France winger Vincent Clerc praised teammate Bastareaud, who was banned for three months after his admission of lying. ""It was a good performance after some problems in July. He had a great match with two tries and some great defense,"" Clerc said.","Mathieu Bastareaud scores two tries on return from international rugby wilderness .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Three people were killed when a parked car rigged with explosives blew up Saturday in Najaf on the eve of parliamentary elections, the Interior Ministry said. At least 54 others -- 17 Iraqis and 37 Iranians -- were injured in the attack near the Imam Ali Holy Shrine, which houses the tomb of Ali, cousin of the Prophet Mohammed. Two of the dead were Iranians, the interior official said. Najaf, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Baghdad, is frequented by Shiite pilgrims from Iran. Iraqis will go to the polls Sunday to choose a 325-member parliament. The election has been marred by violence despite heavy security. It is Iraq's fifth nationwide vote since 2003, but only the second for a full four-year-term parliament. Three attacks happened Thursday during early voting for those who will be unable to cast ballots Sunday, such as military and security personnel, detainees, hospital staff, and patients. A total of 12 people were killed and dozens were wounded. There have been warnings of further insurgent attacks around the vote. These are Iraq's first national elections since 2005, when the Sunni Arab population boycotted the elections and the political process. A Shiite-led government emerged and the Sunnis, feeling disenfranchised, went on to form the main part of the insurgency. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq calls the elections an ""important milestone in Iraq's democratic progress,"" serving to strengthen the country's sovereignty and independence as the United States draws down its military presence there. Sunday's elections were supposed to happen in January but were delayed because of political disagreements and a delay in passing the election law that paved the way for this vote. There are 18.9 million eligible voters, casting ballots for 325 seats in the Council of Representatives, as Iraq's parliament is called. The seats represent Iraq's 18 provinces. At least a quarter of the positions -- 82 -- are guaranteed to go to women, and eight more have been allocated for minorities. They include five set aside for Christians and one each for the Shabak, Sabaeans (Mandaeans), and Yazidis. The number of seats is increasing from the previous 275. Seat allocation was based on 2005 population data from the Ministry of Trade and adjusted for a 2.8 percent annual growth across all governates. Voting for Iraqis abroad also is happening in 16 countries starting Friday -- including the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, Iran, Canada and others in the Middle East and Europe. There are no exact figures for those eligible to cast ballots abroad. Estimates on turnout have ranged anywhere from 300,000 to 3 million. Around 6,200 candidates from more than 80 political entities are vying for seats. It is the first parliamentary vote to use an open list, in which the voters vote for political entities and, if they want, also can vote for candidates within those entities, according to the U.N. Assistance Mission. Although open lists complicates the training of election staff and the counting of votes, the system enhances the role of the voter in the election beyond casting a vote simply for a political party, the assistance mission says. At least 25 percent of the candidates on the ballot list of each political entity must be women. The assistance mission is providing technical assistance to the Independent High Electoral Commission, which is organizing the vote. The commission has ordered that all political campaigning must end as of 7 a.m. Saturday. A number of other special measures are being put in place for security reasons. Since Monday, there has been a ban on motorcycles and bicycles in Baghdad until further notice, and on Sunday a two-day ban on any vehicles in cities will begin, Iraqi authorities announced on state television. Provincial borders will be sealed, preventing movements between provinces, from Saturday to Monday. And international borders and all airports will be shut from midnight Saturday. A curfew will be in place in cities from midnight to 5 a.m. on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, officials said. Civilians may not carry weapons on those days, they said. More than 47,000 polling stations will be open across the country, each one able to accept a maximum number of 420 voters. Polling stations are clustered into polling centers. Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. All those in line at the time the polls are open will be able to vote. About 300,000 trained election staff -- mostly teachers, principals, and lawyers -- will be on hand at polling sites. There will be more than 494,000 local and international observers, according to the Independent High Electoral Commission. The number includes about 500 to 600 international observers, according to the United Nations. Voter turnout figures should be available shortly after polls close, and preliminary results are expected by Tuesday or Wednesday, the United Nations said. Results will start emerging for each province as soon as 30 percent of polling centers in that province are tallied. Counting will take place at the polling stations at the end of voting, under the gaze of observers. Ballots will be counted twice to ensure accuracy. The number of ballots cast will be reconciled with the number of ballots issued to each polling station, and in case of a significant discrepancy, the station will be audited. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Explosion near Imam Ali Holy Shrine kills 3 on day before parliamentary elections .

"(CNN) -- The health care bill's passage has struck such an emotional chord that more than 10,000 people have posted comments and sometimes deeply personal stories about it on CNN.com. Under the bill, which President Obama is expected to sign Tuesday at the earliest, most Americans will now be required to have health insurance or pay a fine. Larger employers will be required to provide coverage or risk financial penalties. Total individual out-of-pocket expenses will be capped, and insurers will be barred from denying coverage based on gender or pre-existing conditions. Democrat Alison Victoria, who was a financial manager at a hospital for 15 years, supported the bill. As it's written, the bill ""isn't perfect, and it's not everything I wanted, but it will save lives,"" Victoria said in an iReport video. ""Doctors, nurses and financial officers see a part of our health care system that many Americans don't, if they're lucky,"" she said. ""We have seen benefits denied based on false allegations that the treatment is not medically necessary. We have seen families and whole small businesses dropped from insurance coverage because one person on the plan got sick. We have seen people unable to find insurance because of a pre-existing condition,"" she said, likening the bill to a form of ""justice"" promised in the Constitution. See complete coverage of the health care bill . Another reader used sarcasm to suggest that people will find a way around paying premiums. ""This is cool. I'm just going to drop my insurance now, pay the $700 yearly fine, and then pickup insurance when I get sick since insurance companies can't deny me,"" he wrote on the Sound Off section of a CNN.com news story published after the bill passed. ""I'll save a bundle of money every year."" ""I suspect this is what most 'smart' Americans will do,"" he continued. ""And then guess what? Insurance companies will collapse because they'll have no pool of money to pay for the claims that start coming in, and we'll be in a world of hurt again."" What will health care reform mean to you? Many people who responded to CNN's coverage said they were happy the bill passed simply because the current system was not working. Government-backed health care is ""the best compromise possible,"" Egberto Willies said. He's relieved that his wife, who has lupus, and his daughter, a pre-med student, won't have to worry about health care as much under the new bill, he said. ""America has joined the civilized world,"" he said in his iReport video. iReporter Cameron Harrelson, however, said he is afraid that his generation will end up paying for the bill. ""We're going to have to endure it the longest,"" the 15-year-old from Georgia said. Cliff Olney's daughter was born premature, and he's had to spend more than two decades caring for her with Medicaid, the U.S. health program funded by state and federal governments available to low-income people or people with disabilities. ""After 22 years of fighting health insurance companies, me and my daughter have vindication,"" he told iReport. But he also thinks the fight is far from over. ""You know what's going to happen now ... the insurance companies will begin to cut people who are sick as quickly as they can before the window of opportunity is over ... they'll also increase premiums as the banks did after legislation was passed for credit card reform."" Michael Ingram, of Milford, Pennsylvania, says he's in good health and feels like he doesn't need health insurance. As a Navy veteran, he goes to a Veterans Affairs hospital when he's ill, he said. ""Forcing me to take a health care package that I may not need is dictatorial and not in keeping with the spirit or a free nation,"" Ingram wrote in his iReport. He said he's written to his representatives about the bill and said both parties are a ""sham."" He plans to refuse to buy a health care plan. ""I hope that everyone can give this [health care bill] a chance,"" wrote one CNN.com reader who identified herself as a 27-year-old recent college graduate who is working full time for a law firm and has health insurance through her job. Two years ago, she was diagnosed with two debilitating diseases that require chemotherapy twice a week and 19 prescription drugs at a cost of $660 a month after insurance, she said. She and her husband, who doesn't have health insurance because it would cost $1,000 extra to add him to her plan, feel like they can barely keep their heads above water. ""The hardest thing for me, is that I know he has medical issues that go unattended because we simply can't afford it,"" she wrote. ""We truly are a family that is one major illness away from financial disaster. So I hope this bill will help our situation, and the situations of people much less fortunate than ourselves.""","Former hospital financial manager says bill ""isn't perfect ... but it will save lives""

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Britain's Ministry of Defense has released files on UFO sightings dating back to the 1970s, including witness accounts and the government's response. The ministry on Wednesday released the files as part of a four-year project to transfer all of the UFO documents to the National Archives to make them available to curious members of the public. The documents include hundreds of police reports taken from witnesses who describe seeing lights or strange objects in the sky, from southern England and Wales up to Northern Ireland. The files released Wednesday cover 1978 to 1987. The rest, dating from the 1950s and covering recent history, will be released over the coming years. Reported sightings typically describe various shapes and colors of lights, moving in formation or hovering in the sky. Witnesses reported orange, red, white and green lights that were diamond-shaped, square, or cigar-shaped. They reported them to police, who have a standard 16-question form specifically for UFO sightings. ""The vast majority of them are just ordinary people who've seen something unusual and thought that they ought to tell someone about it,"" said David Clarke, a professor at Sheffield Hallam University and a UFO expert who worked with the National Archives on the project. In one sighting in January 1985, a man near Cardiff, Wales, was closing his living room curtains when he saw an object in the sky. He said it moved ""up and down like a bouncing ball,"" then disappeared behind a mountain. Two police officers in Woking, south of London, reported seeing a white light in the sky on Christmas morning 1985. The light, they said, moved into the nearby area of Horsell, where author H.G. Wells had placed the Martian landing in his book, ""War of the Worlds."" The person who took the report noted the officers were aware of the connection, writing, ""Genuine report. Two competent officers slightly embarrassed (Horsell Common features in H.G. Wells)."" Two other police officers in Edgware, north London, reported seeing an object in the sky in June 1984. They viewed it with binoculars for an hour and sketched a picture, showing a white sphere with a ring of blue and red lights. ""The object moved erratically from side to side, up and down and to and fro, not venturing far from its original position,"" the officers wrote. Other reports came from stunned members of the public, pilots, and members of the military. The Ministry of Defense said it examined the reports and held onto the records solely to determine whether enemy aircraft had infiltrated British airspace. Once it was determined that no enemy aircraft were in the sky, it did not investigate further.  Watch why the ministry is revealing what it knows about UFOs » . ""The Ministry of Defense has no other interest or role regarding UFO matters and does not consider questions regarding the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life-forms,"" it said Wednesday. That leaves many of the incidents simply unexplained, such as an April 1984 report made by a senior air traffic controller at an unidentified airfield. The controller was bringing in a light aircraft for landing when he noticed a series of lights appearing to come down on another runway. The crew of the incoming plane radioed that they saw the lights, too. All reported that they saw the lights come down ""at speed,"" touch down, and disappear. ""They were so concerned about this, they filed an official report,"" Clarke said. ""But what was the thing that they saw? There's no evidence from the papers that any further investigations were done and it remains a mystery."" In 1979, two years after Steven Spielberg's alien-visitation movie ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" reports of strange sightings had increased and the House of Lords decided to hold a debate on UFOs. One of the documents released Wednesday is a detailed briefing prepared by the Ministry of Defense for the debate, and it sheds light on the military's position on the matter. ""There is nothing to indicate that ufology (the study of UFOs) is anything but claptrap and no evidence at all of 'alien space craft,'"" read the briefing, prepared by the ministry for Lord Strabolgi, then government chief whip. At least one report in the files has since been explained, however. A report from August 1985 details the crop circles that two army officers found in a wheat field in Andover, in southern England. They noted one large circle surrounded by four smaller ones, all perfectly round with the wheat pressed down in a clockwise direction. No tracks led up to the circles, they said. The farmer called the army officers because he thought the Army Air Corps had created the circles, but the officers said they were stumped. ""None of us could offer any reasonable explanation,"" they wrote. It is now known that the crop circles were some of many created by two hoaxers named Doug Bowers and Dave Chorley, according to Clarke. ""Doug and Dave,"" as they were called, came forward in 1990 to say they created the circles with a garden roller and planks of wood, Clarke said. ""We now know that this particular circle near Andover was one of the ones that was created as a hoax by these two men,"" he said.","British Ministry of Defense releases files on UFO sightings dating back to 1970s .

"(CNN) -- David Beckham believes the furore that followed his return to the LA Galaxy from his loan spell with AC Milan earlier this year has galvanized the team. The Galaxy won the MLS Western Conference Championship with a 2-0 win at home to Houston Dynamo on Friday night, Beckham setting up Gregg Berhalter's 102nd-minute opener. They will face Real Salt Lake, who upset the favored Chicago Fire 5-4 in a penalty shootout to win the Eastern Conference title on Saturday to reach the MLS Cup final in Seattle next Sunday. Beckham had been subjected to abuse by his own fans after missing the start of the MLS season when he was in Italy, while Galaxy captain Landon Donovan questioned his commitment to the LA franchise. However, the England midfielder -- who missed Saturday's 1-0 friendly defeat by Brazil in Qatar to play for his club -- thinks the situation helped bring the team together. ""There's nothing wrong with a bit of controversy in a club, it brings players and teams together and it's done that,"" Beckham told ESPN in a post-match interview. ""I don't have to say anything about myself, I leave that down to other people to decide. ""I love playing soccer. I work hard for my teammates, myself, my manager, the fans and I hope that's enough for people."" Beckham joined the Galaxy from Real Madrid in 2007 but they struggled to make an impact during the Englishman's time with the team until the arrival of former USA national team coach Bruce Arena. Beckham, who returns to Milan in January as he bids to win a place in England's World Cup squad, believes this season's achievements have already gone some way for making up for the previous two seasons. ""We want to win next week but reaching it is the biggest thing,"" he told the UK Press Association.

"(CNN) -- Texas Rep. Randy Neugebauer says he was the Republican House member who called out ""baby killer"" during the chamber's debate Sunday night on the health care reform bill. Neugebauer issued a statement Monday apologizing for the outburst. His statement said he called out, ""It's a baby killer,"" in reference to the last-minute deal between Michigan Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak and the White House that secured the support of Stupak and other anti-abortion Democrats for the health care bill. ""Last night was the climax of weeks and months of debate on a health care bill that my constituents fear and do not support,"" Neugebauer's statement said. ""In the heat and emotion of the debate, I exclaimed the phrase 'it's a baby killer' in reference to the agreement reached by the Democratic leadership."" The interruption occurred as Stupak was delivering an emotional speech defending the deal with the White House that called for President Obama to issue an executive order guaranteeing that the bill would not change existing limits on federal funding for abortion. The phrase yelled by Neugebauer was initially believed to have been directed at Stupak personally. ""While I remain heartbroken over the passage of this bill and the tragic consequences it will have for the unborn, I deeply regret that my actions were mistakenly interpreted as a direct reference to Congressman Stupak himself,"" Neugebauer's statement said. ""I have apologized to Mr. Stupak and also apologize to my colleagues for the manner in which I expressed my disappointment about the bill,"" the statement concluded. ""The House Chamber is a place of decorum and respect. The timing and tone of my comment last night was inappropriate."" The incident evoked memories of Rep. Joe Wilson, a South Carolina Republican, who yelled ""you lie"" during Obama's health care speech to a joint session of Congress in September. Wilson also apologized, and the House formally reprimanded him for the outburst. CNN's Brianna Keilar contributed to this report.","Rep.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Al-Shabaab, a hard-line Somali rebel group that is on the U.S. government's terror watch list, has threatened to attack neighboring Kenya, according to an online audio recording. On an Al-Shabaab Web site, men chant in Kiswahili, the national language of Kenya, saying, ""We will reach Nairobi. When we arrive, we will hit until we kill."" A taped message in Arabic follows, thought to be by Abu Zubeyr, Al-Shabaab's commander in Somalia. The speaker of the message threatens those he calls infidels, throughout the world. It would not be the first threat by Al-Shabaab toward Kenya. Many analysts say Kenya is vulnerable to attack by the Islamic group, which is trying to overthrow the weak transitional government. The threat follows heightened tensions between the Kenyan government and Somalis living in Kenya over the past month. Kenya recently rounded up and arrested several hundred Somali immigrants and refugees living in a mostly Somali neighborhood. And earlier this month, Muslim protesters clashed with police after Friday prayers, leading to one death and extensive property damage. Muslim human-rights groups in Kenya have called for protests in support of cleric Abdulah Ibrahim el-Faisal, whom Kenya declared an unwanted person and deported earlier this month. The Jamaican-born Muslim cleric was previously jailed in Britain for inciting murder and racial hatred. But Kenya's efforts to deport him failed. He was then arrested on return to Kenya, further outraging some Muslim leaders. Alfred Mutua, Kenya's government spokesman, has since said that el-Faisal has successfully been deported. However, the government has given mixed signals as to whether he has actually left.","Group says it will hit Nairobi ""until we kill""

"(CNN)  -- Not content to sit quietly at home eating their tofu cutlets, more and more vegetarians, it seems, are taking action, trying to get the carnivorous masses to change their ways. Of course, the meat-free have been trying to win people over to their cause since the time of Pythagoras. But lately, activists are trying more in-your-face tactics. For Lierre Keith, author of ""The Vegetarian Myth,"" the ""in-your-face"" part is quite literal. A former vegetarian who has publicly recanted, she was lecturing in San Francisco, California, last week, when three masked assailants shouted ""Go vegan!"" and lobbed chili pepper-laced pies at her. Even in hard-core vegan circles -- which exclude using animal-based products for food, clothing, medicine or any other purpose -- such borderline-violent exploits are controversial. More common is the approach of folks like newly converted talk show host Ellen Degeneres, who has been sharing recipes for vegan nachos along with her philosophy. Still, recipes only go so far. And, more to the point, they don't get as much media attention. For many vegan and vegetarian activists, getting coverage is an art. PETA . If you've ever read about a particularly outrageous pro-vegetarian campaign, there's a good chance that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals was behind it. The folks at PETA seem to be firm believers in the idea that ""all media attention is good media attention,"" and the more shocking or ridiculous the stunt, the more media outlets will pick up the story. PETA was laughed at when it tried to rebrand fish as ""sea kittens,"" in hopes that the more cuddly name would make seafood a less appealing mealtime choice. It was criticized for the suggestion that recently deceased Oscar G. Mayer should be buried with his company's hot dog-shaped Wienermobile. After British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay cooked up horse meat on his show, PETA UK dumped a ton of manure outside his London restaurant. Plenty of ecological activists cringe at these kinds of prankish maneuvers, but they do get noticed. And that, apparently, is the point. Why else would PETA organize an army of zombies to protest outside of KFC restaurants? Not content to oppose meat-eating in the real world, PETA also took a swipe at virtual carnivorousness: In response to the Nintendo DS game ""Cooking Mama,"" the group released its own bloody version. And, as anyone who's seen its anti-fur posters knows, PETA is well aware that sex sells. The group got the granddaughter of Argentinean revolutionary Che Guevara to pose wearing nothing but a bandolier filled with carrots. Last, year PETA proposed a too-racy-for-TV ""vegetarians have better sex"" Super Bowl commercial, guaranteeing plenty of coverage when -- surprise! -- NBC rejected the ad. PETA also brings its soft-core approach to the streets with its ""Lettuce Ladies"" campaign: young models, clad in a few strategically placed leaves, handing out veggie hot dogs. The group has enlisted Pamela Anderson and Elizabeth Berkley to pose for the Lettuce Ladies Web site (find it yourself) -- probably the best thing that's happened to their careers in years. Is there tofu wresting? Yes, there is tofu wrestling. Casa Diablo . PETA is not alone in combining feminine pulchritude and an anti-meat agenda. A couple of years back, Portland, Oregon, resident Johnny Diablo got a bunch of media attention when he opened Casa Diablo, the world's first vegan strip club. Serving veggie burgers with a side of nudity (or maybe the other way around) might seem to be just a publicity stunt. (The fact that Diablo tried to put the club up for sale shortly after opening would seem to suggest that.) But Mr. Diablo is an earnest vegan himself, and he's apparently retained ownership of Casa Diablo, though reviews -- of both the cuisine and the more fleshy attractions -- are decidedly mixed. McVegan . As the most public face of our carnivorous culture, McDonald's is a popular target of vegetarian activism. Back in 1985, the London branch of Greenpeace declared October 16 World Anti-McDonald's Day, and every year since, there have been protests and rallies all over the globe. The group Vegan Action, founded by Berkeley students in 1993, has come up with a gentler -- and tastier -- way to combat the ubiquity of the golden arches. With its help, you can host your own ""McVegan"" event. There will be veggie burgers, there will be uniformed servers, and there will even be a costumed clown mascot -- Reggie McVeggie, ""Ronald's kinder brother."" The slogan: ""Billions and billions saved."" Vegan Avengers . Even a green group like Friends of the Earth isn't safe from vegan wrath. Last year, the group hosted a comedy night at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, only to have the event crashed by masked activists wearing enormous artificial testicles. They called themselves the ""Vegan Avengers,"" and their crude slogan suggested that the middle-of-the-road members of FoE should grow a similar pair by supporting veganism. The Avengers have not been heard from since their single appearance.","For many vegan and vegetarian activists, getting media attention is an art .

"(CNN)  -- Rafael Nadal may be more used to serving aces than strutting his stuff on a film set but that has not stopped the former world number one from appearing with Colombian rock star Shakira in her new music video. The scenes of the two stars used to accompany the global release of the ""Gypsy"" single were filmed in Barcelona, Spain last month where the chemistry between the 23-year-old Spaniard and the Latin American singer were such that denials were released by both parties to quash rumors of a love match. Though Nadal is in no danger of winning an Oscar for his acting skills, his cameo appearance was just one in a long list of tennis stars who have flirted with the silver screen. Any come to mind? Open Court sifted through the archives to find other famous examples of tennis stars caught on camera. Let us know if there are any we have missed by adding your comment at the bottom of the page. Anna Kournikova: . Given her status as a celebrity, which rather overshadowed her abilities as a tennis player, the former Wimbledon semifinalist and number one ranked doubles player, was inevitably going to turn her talents to acting. Rather in the Nadal mode, Kournikova does not have any lines to fluff when appearing with Spanish pop star Enrique Inglesias in a video to promote his 2001 single ""Escape"". Having been ""seduced"" in a variety of role-play settings by Enrique, the pair later dated in real life. The single reached number 12 in the United States listings. John McEnroe: . The former bad boy of tennis, famous for his rants and run-ins with umpires, would appear to have all the ingredients for a director looking to add a star name to his film credits and with a bit of acting ability to boot. McEnroe, who was once married to the movie star Tatum O'Neal, has in fact   appeared in six films, the latest Adam Sandler's 2008 release ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" where he predictably plays himself. The film did well at the box office and, considering his other cameo alongside Robert De Niro in ""Anger Management,"" the grand slam great could be set for further feature film parts. But whether he will follow soccer legend Eric Cantona in taking lead roles in critically acclaimed films may be open to question. Vijay Amritraj: . The Indian star's handsome profile and suave personality lent itself to the movie world and sure enough a Hollywood producer spotted him as he gave a post match television interview. He was given an immediate screen test between the second and third rounds while playing at Wimbledon and landed more than just a walk-on part in the 13th Bond movie ""Octopussy."" Rather predictably, Vijay's role did have a tennis angle with the baddie Kamal Khan playing at the same club as him, where he was able to keep watch for 007 Roger Moore. Vijay also kills a kukri-wielding Gurkha with his racket,before getting his come-uppance from one of Bond's enemies with a nasty knife. He dies muttering the immortal lines ""It was Kamal's men."" A later appearance in ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" marked the end of his film career, but Vijay made regular appearances on a popular television show on American network NBC to extend his acting career. Althea Gibson: . Any history of tennis or indeed sport in general, will point to the pivotal role which Althea Gibson played in breaking down barriers for the African-American community. As a forerunner for the likes of the Williams sisters four decades later, Gibson became the first black player to win Wimbledon in 1957, before defending the title the year after to add to a career haul of five grand slam singles titles. Despite the success, Gibson had never profited from her triumphs as a lifelong amateur so on retirement in 1959 she took a career change that saw her release an album of songs and appear in ""The Horse Soldiers"", a John Ford-directed western -- where she played a liberated slave who rides alongside John Wayne. William Holden also appeared in the film, but sadly it was Gibson's first and last and she turned to playing professional golf to earn a living. Maria Sharapova: . Given her worldwide fame and celebrity, the Russian tennis icon would appear to be a Hollywood producer's dream but her chance of celluloid glory was thwarted by -- a Hollywood producer. The 2004 feature ""Wimbledon"" starred Kirsten Dunst as Lizzie Bradbury, a single-minded American tennis star who finds love in the form of a less than dedicated British player Peter Colt (Paul Bettany), who inspired by Bradbury does the impossible by winning the men's singles. A very unlikely scenario but highly predictable for a feel good film. Sharapova was supposed to have played one of Bradbury's hapless opponents, but according to the commentary on the DVD of the film, she was considered too much of a likeness to Dunst and did not get the part. A glut of players, Chris Evert, John McEnroe (inevitably) and Luke Jensen amongst others lend their faces to the film and CNN's Open Court presenter Pat Cash advised on the action shots. But one can't help but think that an appearance by Sharapova may have boosted box office takings even more, although she did appear at the glitzy premiere in Hollywood in September, 2004, towering over the diminutive Dunst. Bill Tilden: . Another infamous tennis star who is rated one of the all-time greats for his grand slam exploits, but attracted less than favorable headlines for his private life, was another to try his hand at entertainment without a tennis racket. The controversial life of tennis great Tilden . Tilden dominated the men's game in the 1920s before turning professional and was still a force into his 40s, playing to big crowds against the likes of Donald Budge and Fred Perry. But away from tennis, Tilden's great passion was movies and theater. He was a personal friend of screen icon Charlie Chaplin and ploughed much of his fortune into three Broadway plays, which he wrote and produced and also appeared in. All bombed spectacularly and Hollywood did not come calling. The Players (1979 movie) This makes our list because of the sheer numbers of star players, who have cameo roles or -- in the case of the great Pancho Gonzales -- starred in a major supporting role. Gonzales, who received a panning from critics for his pains, also has a credit in the more successful 1953 release ""Pat and Mike"" starring screen legends Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. The corny plot of The Players (see ""Wimbledon"" above) has crooner Dean Martin's son (Dean Paul Martin) play a rising young tennis star who falls for an older woman Nicole (Ali McGraw). It is loaded with walk on parts for John McEnroe, his predecessor as the ""enfant terrible"" of tennis, Ilie Nastase, and the Argentine ace Guillermo Vilas. Tom Gullikson, John Lloyd, Dennis Ralston and Ion Tiriac also appear as well as legendary British tennis commentator Dan Maskell, but it proved a turkey. Roll credits . So that's Open Court's guide to the best and mostly worse in tennis acting careers, but while the sport remains a favorite among celebrities and rich Hollywood film moguls, the list is sure to grow and as we went to press reports from India say 11-time grand slam doubles champion Leander Paes is wanting to join the ranks of Bollywood after taking acting lessons for over a year. Judging by the efforts of his predecessors he might need them.","Tennis stars of past and present have turned their talents to land roles in films .

"Fargo, North Dakota (CNN) -- Officials in North Dakota and Minnesota are catching their breath Monday, if only briefly, after the Red River crested over the weekend. Despite the river peaking at 36.99 feet -- 19 feet above flood level -- Sunday morning, the region will have to contend with high water for a while. ""It'll be about a week, so we're just going to continue to monitor things and kind of wait as that water very, very slowly goes down,"" said Robyn Litke, spokeswoman for Fargo, North Dakota. ""We are just continuing to maintain our dikes and just continuing the dike patrols. It is expected that we will stay well above major the major flood stage of 30 feet for about the next week or maybe a little bit longer."" Overall, the situation in Fargo looked good, Mayor Dennis Walaker said Sunday. ""We're standing tall,"" Walaker said. ""We have to stand tall for a few more days."" Are you there? Share your photos, videos and stories . Craig Fugate, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was expected to tour Fargo on Monday to survey the area's response to the high waters. When the river recedes to 30 feet, Fargo can begin removing dikes, a city official said. The waters were expected to begin their retreat late Sunday at a rate two to three times slower than it rose. The Red River flooding began last week when warmer weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and its sister city of Moorhead, Minnesota, causing the river to swell. Upstream, snow and ice have yet to melt, pushing water back toward the two cities. Last year, the Red River crested at nearly 41 feet -- a record and about 4 feet higher than this year's level. Water surrounded some homes near the river in Fargo, where 700,000 sandbags guarded the city from creeping waters. At least 10 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the area since Friday, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Moorhead also was on alert, and the city was advising residents to monitor sandbag dikes. Between Moorhead and Fargo, more than 1 million sandbags were stacked to defend against the river's rise. Between Saturday night and Sunday morning, teams in Cass County, North Dakota -- which includes Fargo -- rushed to three locations to reinforce sandbag dikes, said Capt. Grant Larson of the North Dakota Air National Guard. He said that 1,000 sandbags were stacked around a home threatened by flooding Sunday morning. ""This house would have been lost,"" Larson added. In the southern Plains, authorities said they linked four deaths to an early spring snowstorm that blanketed the region. Stacy Moore, 26, died Saturday when her car veered off a slush-covered road in Unionville, Missouri, said Michael Weiseman, radio operator for the Missouri Highway Patrol. Moore was ejected when her vehicle flipped, Weiseman said Sunday. Weather-related vehicle crashes killed one in Kansas and two in Oklahoma, authorities said. Oklahoma police investigated 244 crashes, one that resulted in the death of a 7-year-old in Logan County on Saturday, the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management reported. On Sunday, a 77-year-old woman was killed when her car struck a tree after she lost control on an icy road, the department said. Parts of Arkansas and Oklahoma received at least 1 foot of snow. CNN Radio's Shelby Erdman and CNN's Aaron Cooper, Justin Lear, Dina Majoli, Khadijah Rentas and Reynolds Wolf contributed to this report.","Red River peaks at 19 feet above flood level over weekend .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The National Transportation Safety Board has released dramatic animation of two runway near-collisions this year to illustrate what the agency says is the need for improvements in runway safety. The NTSB animation shows two planes nearly colliding at the San Francisco International Airport in May. The first animation shows a Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 and a United Airlines Airbus A320 coming within 230 feet of colliding on the runway at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida in July. The re-creation was based on radar and flight data recorder information from the planes involved. The animation includes audio from the air traffic controller, who can be heard yelling, ""Stop, stop, stop!"" to the United plane as the Delta aircraft attempts to land.  Watch animation, hear controller's pleas » . The second animation shows a May incident at San Francisco International Airport in California in which a Republic Airlines jet takes off, coming within 35 feet of a SkyWest Airlines commuter turboprop that has just landed. There were no injuries in either situation. The videos were shown Thursday during the NTSB's annual ""most wanted transportation safety improvements"" board meeting, where the agency reviews its greatest concerns in transportation safety. The Federal Aviation Administration reported that serious runway incursions were reduced by 25 percent in 2007, but the NTSB said much work remains on runway safety and systems to notify pilots when they are about to collide with another plane or vehicle. NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker expressed frustration with the slow progress of implementing new technology, such as the use of a global positioning system-type procedure in cockpits that would help warn pilots of dangers on the runway. Rosenker told the NTSB-only panel, ""It is time to do something before we have to investigate an accident that is catastrophic."" Among the most wanted transportation safety improvements cited on the NTSB's Web site are items to ""stop runway incursions/ground collisions of aircraft"" with the notations ""action needed by Federal Aviation Administration"" and ""unacceptable response."" The site says systems the FAA has added to airports to warn air traffic controllers of potential collisions aren't ""sufficient."" ""In recent incidents, [one system] did not alert controllers in time to be effective, and the situations were instead resolved by flight crew actions that sometimes bordered on heroics or just plain luck,"" the NTSB site says. ""Until there is a system in place to positively control ground movements of all aircraft, with direct warning to pilots, the potential for this type of disaster will continue to be high."" Rosenker told Thursday's board gathering that ""this must be resolved."" ""We've had this recommendation for a number of years -- too many number of years,"" he said. Other areas of NTSB concern include fuel tanks on airplanes, pilot and air traffic controller fatigue, and technologies that could help prevent automobile collisions. E-mail to a friend .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN)  -- Five presumed drug gang members and one soldier were killed in shootouts Thursday and Friday after criminals blocked thoroughfares in two northern Mexico states to prevent military reinforcements from arriving, authorities said. The criminals used cars, transit buses and tractor-trailers to block roads and streets in the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon in northeastern Mexico, said an official with the Nuevo Leon public security office. The official was briefed on the incidents but declined to be named because she is not allowed to speak for the department. Three gang members were killed Thursday in Tamaulipas and two died early Friday in the city of Monterrey, in Nuevo Leon, the official said. One soldier was killed and four wounded in the Tamaulipas confrontation, the security official said. Two of the road blocks happened Thursday and five more were set up before dawn Friday, the official said. All were cleared within a matter of hours. The area, which borders Texas, has seen bloody fighting between the Zetas and Gulf cartels after a recent gangland slaying. Hours-long gun battles are common, and U.S. officials were recently forced to temporarily close the consulate in the city of Reynosa. The trouble started January 18 when a Gulf cartel member killed top Zeta lieutenant Victor Mendoza. The Zetas demanded that the Gulf cartel turn over the killer, but the narco group refused. The Zetas, composed mostly of former elite military troops, had been the armed enforcers for the Gulf cartel since 2001. The Zetas have become more independent in recent years, and the all-out war between the two cartels indicates the split is apparently permanent. Nuevo Leon public security chief Luis Carlos Trevino was quoted in published reports as saying that the military will continue ongoing operations against the criminals despite the road blocks and other obstacles. Soldiers carried out raids Thursday in the cities of El Carmen, Sabinas, Vallecillo and Paras. ""The organized crime groups have tried through different means and methods to turn the roads of the metropolitan Monterrey area upside down, looking to form blockades with civilian vehicles to prevent support troops going to the areas where these actions are taking place,"" Trevino said at a news conference Thursday. The drug gang members used tractor-trailers, buses and cars to close the Reynosa Highway and the road to Miguel Aleman, causing panic among residents and traffic chaos, the security chief said. The highway from Monterrey to Reynosa was closed for at least two hours in both directions when armed men forced at least six car drivers and a tractor-trailer driver to station their vehicles across the road. The gunmen also burned three cars and a pickup truck to close the Miguel de la Madrid Boulevard in Monterrey. In addition, gunmen stole several cars and trucks to use as roadblocks in both directions on the highway to Miguel Aleman, Trevino said. Mexico has been gripped in massive drug-related bloodshed since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006. Much of the violence has centered around Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. Juarez drew attention in the United States last weekend when three people associated with the U.S. consulate in the city were gunned down. Two of the victims were U.S. citizens who lived in El Paso. Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said earlier this week authorities believe Saturday's slayings were carried out by the Barrio Azteca drug gang. No motive has been revealed and no arrests have been made. About 200 U.S. federal, state and local authorities interviewed more than 100 Barrio Azteca members and associates in El Paso and southern New Mexico on Thursday, the Justice Department said. There are no official government tallies, but more than 16,000 people are estimated to have died in the drug wars. The vast majority of the deaths are among reputed criminals, with some police and military also being killed. Relatively few of the deaths are civilians. Even so, the United States and Canada have issued travel warnings, particularly along the border area. The Texas Department of Public Safety took the unprecedented step this year of recommending that students on spring break not go to border areas inside Mexico. News of the violence and the travel warnings apparently have had an effect. Mexicans say tourism along the border has declined this year, with one business owner in Tijuana telling CNN that his business has dropped 40 percent.","Five presumed drug gang members, soldier killed in shootouts .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have issued sketches of three people sought in connection with the spate of eastern Texas church fires. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives released the drawings Friday at a news conference in Tyler, Texas. We have a serial arsonist out there,"" said Robert Champion, special agent in charge of ATF's Dallas, Texas, office. ""We need help from the public."" There have been a total of 11 church fires so far this year, 10 of them found to be deliberately set. There is no clear theme linking the fires, which have struck churches of different denominations, including Baptist, Methodist and Church of Christ Scientist, on different days of the week and at different times of the day. While the churches are located in small towns, not all of them are in remote locations. Police patrols have been stepped up near churches, and in some cases church members are staying at their churches to protect them or patrolling around the churches themselves. ""I think maybe I would characterize the mood of our people as perplexed,"" Randy Daniels, mayor of Athens, Texas, told CNN earlier this week. Athens, a town of about 12,000 people, has had three of its church set on fire. In Tyler, Texas, the Tyland Baptist Church was among those set ablaze. Pastor David Mahfood told CNN on Wednesday there was nothing left from the January 16 fire -- ""not a Bible, not a hymnal. We've got some bricks. That's it."" At another destroyed church, Russell United Methodist Church in Wills Point, Texas, members are trying to salvage what they can from the ashes. A large brass cross that hung over the church's choir loft was recently found, church member Kay Crosby told CNN. ""It was kind of twisted, but we're going to have it restored,"" she said.","Sketches of three people released by ATF .

"(CNN) -- Caroline Wozniacki has earned a career-high world No. 2 tennis ranking after winning through to the final of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells in California. The second-seeded Dane will move above the injured Dinara Safina and close the gap on No. 1 Serena Williams when the latest standings are released on Monday. The 19-year-old will play former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic in the final of the Californian outdoor hardcourt tournament after defeating close friend Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2 6-3 on Friday night. Wozniacki, who reached the U.S. Open final last year before losing to comeback queen Kim Clijsters, will be seeking her seventh title on the WTA Tour. She dominated against fifth seed Radwanska, winning the first five games of the opening set and then taking the final four points off the Pole's serve in the match-clinching game. ""We know each other so well. We know each other's strengths and weaknesses,"" Wozniacki told the tournament's official Web site. ""Agnieszka is a great fighter. She doesn't give up. I knew that I had to fight till the last point to win this match. ""She actually owes me an ice cream. She thought we were going to play first match, and I said, 'No, we're going to play late, or 7:30.' Then we made a bet, as well, and I won, so at least I get an ice cream. But I have to buy dinner."" Wozniacki has lost all four previous encounters with sixth seed Jankovic, who defeated Australian eighth seed Samantha Stosur 6-2 6-4 earlier on Friday. The Serbian, now ranked ninth, has reached the final at Indian Wells for the first time in nine appearances, and will be looking to emulate compatriots Ana Ivanovic and Novak Djokovic by clinching the title there. ""I thought the key to today's match was my return,"" Jankovic said. ""Samantha has an unbelievable serve, one of the best serves in women's game, and I was able to return a lot of her first serves. ""I was putting a lot of pressure on her second serve. So I think that was the key, because I was able to break her quite a few times. And then it made everything easier for me."" Stosur, who knocked out defending champion in the fourth round, will break into the top-10 following her exploits this week. ""Today was a bit disappointing, but it's still my best result in a tournament like this. I think there's a lot to build on,"" she said.","Second seed Caroline Wozniacki to play Jelena Jankovic in final at Indian Wells .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A trendy California sushi restaurant says it's closing after being accused of serving illegal whale meat. The company that owns Santa Monica's The Hump restaurant had already apologized for the whale meat accusation earlier in the week. The restaurant's Web site said: ""After 12 years doing business in Santa Monica, The Hump will be closing its doors effective March 20, 2010. The Hump hopes that by closing its doors, it will help bring awareness to the detrimental effect that illegal whaling has on the preservation of our ocean ecosystems and species."" The investigation into the eatery began in October when two members of the team that made the documentary, ""The Cove"" visited The Hump, officials said. ""The Cove,"" which exposes the annual killing of dolphins at a Japanese fishing village, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary earlier in March. Armed with a hidden camera, two women from the documentary captured the waitress serving them whale and horse meat and identifying them as such, a federal criminal complaint said. A receipt from the restaurant at the end of the meal identified their selection as ""whale"" and ""horse"" with a cost of $85 written next to them. The women snuck pieces of the meat into a napkin and later sent them for examination to a researcher at Oregon State University. He identified the whale sample to be that of sei whale, prosecutors said. The meat from whales, considered an endangered species, cannot be sold legally in the United States. The restaurant, located at the Santa Monica Airport, is known for its exotic fare. Its Web site asks diners to surrender themselves to its chefs for ""a culinary adventure ... unlike any that you have previously experienced."" Prosecutors have also charged Typhoon Restaurant Inc., the parent company of the restaurant, and one of its chefs -- Kiyoshiro Yamamoto, 45 -- with the illegal sale of a marine mammal product for an unauthorized purpose. The misdemeanor charge carries a federal prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of up to $200,000 for the company, federal authorities said. The Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act make it illegal, except under very limited circumstances, to hunt, kill or capture whales and also prohibit trade in the animals or any part of them.

Cowell's popular U.K. talent show, ""The X Factor,"" will be coming to the United States in the fall of 2011 with the acerbic critic in tow, according to Fox. ""I want to leave 'Idol' this year bigger and better than it was in the past,"" Cowell said at the TCA tour Monday. Cowell will be both executive producer and judge on ""The X Factor."" ""I'm thrilled that we have put a date on the launch of the U.S. version of 'The X Factor,' and delighted to be continuing to work with Fox,"" said Cowell in a statement. ""We have a fantastic relationship, a great team and are all very excited about this."" iReport: Will you watch ""Idol"" without Simon? Speculation has raged for weeks as to Cowell's future. Though he's well paid for his ""Idol"" work -- an estimated $36 million per season -- he has expressed a desire to focus on ""The X Factor."" Cowell said at the press session that it's taken some time to reach an agreement for his new duties, hence the buzz. (Indeed, he signed the last page of his ""contract"" on stage with Fox executives Peter Rice and Kevin Reilly.) ""[I] didn't think it was right to do two shows in America at the same time, so [I] decided to leave one and start another,"" he said. He said he missed Paula Abdul, the former ""Idol"" judge who left the show in August, but wouldn't confirm or deny whether she would appear on ""X Factor"" in the U.S. Cowell and Abdul had a good-naturedly contentious relationship on ""Idol,"" with the tough-minded Brit often acting as bad cop to the ""Forever Your Girl"" singer's good cop. Ellen DeGeneres, who's taking over Abdul's judging slot, joked about Cowell's announcement on her talk show Monday -- getting in a dig at NBC's late-night troubles as well. ""So this just happened, Simon Cowell just announced that he's leaving 'Idol.' This will be his last season. He announced he's leaving on my first day. I'm trying not to take it personally,"" she said. ""But seriously, I am going to be very, very sad to see him go, because I think he's made the show what it is. He's a huge part of that show but he wanted a change. I wish him all the luck in the world hosting 'The Tonight Show,' "" said DeGeneres, referring to widespread speculation about how NBC will resolve its issues with its late-night talk shows. In reality, of course, Simon Cowell has not been part of that speculation. Since its premiere in 2002, ""Idol"" has been an entertainment phenomenon, regularly ranking as TV's top show, creating several musical stars and pulling in millions more viewers than its closest competition. Its new season premieres Tuesday. Cowell's presence has been credited as a major reason. The British music executive was a judge on the British version of ""Idol,"" ""Pop Idol,"" and came to the United States when Fox imported the show. Unlike judges on many American talent shows, Cowell didn't sugar-coat his criticisms to contestants. With the show's growing popularity -- by its fourth season it was the top show on television, a rank it has held ever since -- Cowell and fellow ""Idol"" players Abdul, judge Randy Jackson and amiable host Ryan Seacrest became stars in their own right. Though the show continues to dominate American TV, ratings have started sliding in ""Idol's"" past two seasons. But Cowell told the TCA audience he had no doubt about the show's future. It will ""continue to be the No. 1 show"" in the country, Cowell said. The show has given him ""the best days of my life."" Asked who should replace him, he jokingly suggested Seacrest, with whom Cowell has also good-naturedly tangled. The Fox executives said they're not going to rush to find Cowell's replacement.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)  -- The Obama administration's first high-level direct talks with North Korea yielded no promise by Pyongyang to return to six-party negotiations aimed at ending its nuclear program, but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday nonetheless called the meeting ""quite positive."" In Washington, Clinton said she agreed with special envoy Stephen Bosworth that the talks were ""very useful,"" adding, ""It does remain to be seen whether and when the North Koreans will return to the six-party talks, but the bottom line is that these were exploratory talks, not negotiations."" North Korea has refused to return to the talks conducted by the United States, Russia, China, South Korea and Japan, insisting that it wants to talk directly with the U.S. In April, Pyongyang declared the talks ""dead"" in anger over international criticism of its nuclear and missile tests this year. Clinton previously said the United States was willing to meet bilaterally with North Korea but only within the framework of the six-party talks. She also has warned the United States will not normalize ties with Pyongyang or lift sanctions unless North Korea takes irreversible steps toward dismantling its nuclear program. Of his three-day visit, Bosworth said, ""My purpose ... was to facilitate the resumption of the six-party talks and to reaffirm the goal of fully implementing the September 2005 joint statement."" Holding a news conference Thursday in Seoul after his visit to North Korea, Bosworth said, ""I communicated President Obama's view that complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is a fundamental undertaking of the six-party process ... and that the absence of progress on denuclearization is an obstacle to improving our relations."" As Obama ""has made it clear, the United States is prepared to work with allies, partners in the region to offer ... North Korea a different future,"" he said. Bosworth said he held talks with North Korean officials, but not President Kim Jong Il, because ""we did not ask"" for a meeting with the leader. He said they did not make plans for a future meeting. Many observers are wondering what's behind the North's latest moves, and some said Bosworth's trip is a positive. ""The visit gives North Korea a lot of 'face,' a sense of importance,"" said Wenran Jiang, political science professor at the University of Alberta in Canada. Some analysts said North Korea might be trying to buy time. Earlier reports in Seoul claimed that North Korea is in the final stages of restoring its Yongbyon nuclear plant, which Pyongyang had begun to disable before walking away from the six-party talks. Given the secrecy of the North, those reports could not be verified. Analysts said North Korea also is desperate to break out of its diplomatic isolation and ease its economic pain, especially after the U.N. Security Council imposed tougher sanctions on the country in response to Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests. A joint statement issued by the six-party nations in September 2005 said North Korea had ""committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration raised the stakes in the health care debate Monday, releasing a new blueprint that seeks to bridge the gap between measures passed by the Senate and House of Representatives last year. If enacted, the president's sweeping compromise plan would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago. The White House said it would extend coverage to 31 million Americans. Among other things, the White House said it would expand Medicare prescription drug coverage, increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance and give the federal government new authority to block excessive rate hikes by health insurance companies. It increases the threshold -- relative to the Senate bill -- under which a tax on high-end health insurance plans would kick in. As with both the House and Senate plans, it includes significant reductions in Medicare spending in part through changes in payments made under the Medicare Advantage program. President Obama's plan does not include a government-run public health insurance option, an idea strongly backed by liberal Democrats but fiercely opposed by both Republicans and key Democratic moderates. It also eliminates a deeply unpopular provision in the Senate bill worked in by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, that would exempt his Midwestern state from paying increased Medicaid expenses. Administration officials said Obama's measure would cut the deficit by $100 billion over the next 10 years. They estimate the total cost of the bill to be $950 billion in the next decade. The Senate bill would cost an estimated $871 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, while the more expansive House plan has been estimated to cost more than $1 trillion. The release of Obama's plan sets the stage for a critical televised health care summit Thursday with top congressional Republicans. The White House is trying to pressure GOP leaders to present a detailed alternative proposal in advance of the meeting. ""We view this as the opening bid for the health meeting"" on Thursday, White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer told reporters. ""We took our best shot at bridging the differences"" between the House and Senate bills. ""It is our hope the Republicans will come together around [their] plan and post it online"" before the meeting. President's health care blueprint . Pfeiffer said Obama will come to Thursday's meeting ""with an open mind."" The president's willing to back decent Republican ideas if the two sides can have an ""honest, open, substantive discussion"" in which ""both parties can get off their talking points,"" he said. GOP leaders have indicated they will attend the meeting but have urged Democrats to scrap the Senate and House bills completely. They characterized Obama's proposal Monday as setting the stage for a meeting that will amount to little more than political posturing. ""The president has crippled the credibility of this week's summit by proposing the same massive government takeover of health care based on a partisan bill the American people have already rejected,"" said House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""This new Democrats-only backroom deal doubles down on the same failed approach that will drive up premiums, destroy jobs, raise taxes and slash Medicare benefits. This week's summit clearly has all the makings of a Democratic infomercial."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, released a statement calling the plan ""disappointing that Democrats in Washington either aren't listening or are completely ignoring what Americans across the country have been saying."" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs dismissed the GOP criticisms, arguing that Republican leaders had asked for this week's meeting for months. ""If they're not the party of no, Thursday's the perfect venue to be the party of yes,"" Gibbs said. Highlights of Obama's proposal . Under Obama's plan: . • The health and human services secretary would work with a seven-member board of doctors, economists and consumer and insurance representatives to review premium hikes. This Health Insurance Rate Authority would provide an annual report to recommend to states whether certain rate increases should be approved, although the secretary could overrule state insurance regulators. • New health insurance subsidies would be provided to families of four making up to $88,000 annually, or 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Compared with the Senate bill, Obama's proposal lowers premiums for families making between $44,000 and $66,000, according to the White House. Compared with the House legislation, it lowers premiums for families making between $55,000 and $88,000. • The Medicare prescription drug ""doughnut hole"" would be closed by 2020. Under current law, Medicare stops covering drug costs after a plan and beneficiary have spent more than $2,830 on prescription drugs. It starts paying again after an individual's out-of-pocket expenses exceed $4,550. • A 40 percent tax would be imposed on insurance companies providing so-called ""Cadillac"" health plans valued at more than $27,000 for families. The tax would kick in starting in 2018 for all plans. In contrast, the Senate bill would apply the tax to plans valued at more than $23,000 for families. The House bill does not include the tax, which labor unions vehemently oppose. • The federal government would assist states by picking up 100 percent of the costs of expanded Medicaid coverage through 2017. The federal government would cover 95 percent of costs for 2018 and 2019, and 90 percent in the following years. • Health insurance exchanges would be created to make it easier for small businesses, the self-employed and unemployed to pool resources and purchase less expensive coverage. • Total out-of-pocket expenses would be limited, and insurance companies would be prevented from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Insurers would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history. • Individuals under Obama's plan would be required to purchase coverage or face a fine of up to $695 or 2.5 percent of income starting in 2016, whichever is greater. The House bill, in contrast, would have imposed a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual's income. The Senate plan would have required a person to buy coverage or face a fine of up to $750 or 2 percent of his or her income. All three plans include a hardship exemption for poorer Americans. • Companies with more than 50 employees under Obama's plan would be required to pay a fee of $2,000 per worker if the company does not provide coverage and any of that company's workers receives federal health care subsidies. The first 30 workers would be subtracted from the payment calculation. As with the individual requirement, this represents a compromise between the House and Senate plans. • Some $40 billion in tax credits would be established for small businesses to help them provide health care options for their employees. • States could choose whether to ban abortion coverage in plans offered in the health insurance exchanges. Individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage out of their own funds. The White House is following the Senate's lead. The stricter House version banned abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies. •  Illegal immigrants would not be allowed to buy health insurance in the health insurance exchanges. They would be exempted from the individual insurance mandate. As with abortion, the White House is adopting the Senate's language.

"(CNN)  -- Several large circus tents previously used by Cirque du Soleil are on their way to Haiti to be used as a temporary headquarters for the Port-au-Prince government, according to the man donating them. The self-contained tents would replace government buildings destroyed a month ago by the devastating earthquake that killed at least 200,000 people, Nevada real estate developer Tom Schrade said Thursday. An urgent effort is under way to provide shelter for in Haiti, ahead of the rainy season expected to hit the island nation at the end of March. Much of the government is operating in small tents or cramped quarters in buildings that survived the January 12 earthquake. Schrade, who bought the tents after Cirque du Soleil retired them, said his wife got the idea to donate them while they were watching coverage of Haiti relief efforts. ""It seemed like a good thing to do,"" Schrade said. The tents have 33,000 square feet of interior floor space, including heating and air conditioning systems, interior and exterior lighting, toilets and 900 padded chairs, Schrade said. Thirteen steel shipping containers hold the 400,000 pounds of cargo, he said. ""Even the shipping containers can serve as apartments,"" Schrade said. After an aide to the Port-au-Prince mayor confirmed the government would welcome the tents, Schrade said he called Barron Hilton -- the son of Hilton hotel founder Conrad Hilton -- for help in getting them from storage in Reno, Nevada, to Haiti. The Conrad Hilton Foundation, already involved in Haiti relief projects, agreed to finance the shipment, he said. Gregory Anderson, the international project manager for the Hilton Foundation, confirmed its participation. The William J. Clinton Foundation -- the former U.S. president's nonprofit group -- will coordinate getting the big tents to Port-au-Prince, he said. Full coverage of the earthquake's aftermath . A convoy of tractor-trailer trucks left Reno Monday night with the tents bound for the port of Miami, Florida, he said. They'll be loaded onto a ship chartered by the Clinton Foundation next week for the voyage to Port-au-Prince, he said. Technicians hired by Schrade will travel there to supervise the set up, he said. iReport: Looking for loved ones in Haiti . The tents, which initially cost about $5 million, were first used by Cirque du Soleil at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas a decade ago. They also spent time at a Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, theme park before Schrade bought them with the idea of using them at a Reno hotel, he said. The economic downturn derailed Schrade's plan to use the tents at a hotel in Reno, he said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The dominance of England's Premier League has been built on its clubs' ability to lure the world's best players with high wages. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes the UK's tax rate rise will hurt the Premier League's competitiveness. But that could all be about to change after last month's decision by the British government to raise the level of top-rate income tax from 60 cents in every $1.50 to 75 cents. The rate rise, which takes effect from April of 2010, will mean that some well-off people -- including Premier League footballers -- will pay half of any income over $226,000 in tax. And given the average basic salary for a Premier League player is $1.8m, it will make a difference to a lot of players, not just the foreign superstars like Brazil's Robinho and Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo. English premiership managers such as Arsenal's Arsene Wenger believes the tax hike will hurt the Premier League's ability to attract the best players while potentially driving out those players unhappy at paying out more in tax. Wenger was asked if the success of English sides was overly reliant on having the best foreign players. ""That time will soon be over because with the new taxation system, with the collapse of sterling, the domination of the Premier League on that front will go, that is for sure,"" he told the UK's Sunday Times newspaper in a recent interview. Pete Hackleton, who works for accountancy firm Deloitte's sports business group, believes Wenger could be proved right. ""An increase in the tax rate and the decline of the pound against the Euro over the last year to 18 months does put the Premier League at a disadvantage,"" he told CNN. ""I'd say it will have a sizable impact upon the Premier League's competitiveness against other countries. Clubs are going to have to think about how they react to it."" The Premier League's ability to remain the most marketable league in the world has been built on the ability to attract the best talent. But if that talent is unhappy at seeing half or less of their salaries, other leagues in countries with more generous tax bands may become more enticing. Spain's top division, La Liga, is one of the Premier League's biggest rivals in terms of the quality of its product, and it is likely to be best placed to capitalize should England drop the ball. The reason -- aside from the weather -- is the so-called ""Beckham Law."" The country's government introduced legislation four years ago which effectively caps non-Spanish nationals' tax at 24 percent. David Beckham was among the first foreigners to take advantage of it while he was playing for Real Madrid. English clubs desperate to keep hold of their best players without breaking the bank undoubtedly have a challenge on their hands going into the off-season. But there is a little room for maneuver. One area is in a player's image rights, which can be hugely lucrative. If a player is aligned to an image rights company, payments into those companies are income of the image rights company, and the player is not taxed on them. Additionally, the club does not need to make UK social security contributions on those payments. So will the tax rise, married to a falling pound, prompt an exodus of players from England? ""I suspect some of the top players will want to continue to be paid what they're paid at the moment and it's up to clubs to decide if they can afford to pay that,"" continued Hackleton. ""And it's a call for the players to make if they believe they can receive more money elsewhere."" Highest-paid players and top rates of tax per country . Italy 43 per cent . Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Internazionale), Ricardo Kaka (AC Milan) $12m each . Spain 43 percent (24 percent for non-nationals) Lionel Messi (Barcelona) $11.2m . England 50 percent .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to imagine a video of lawyers debating points of constitutional law going viral on YouTube, but the audience for the Proposition 8 trial -- a lawsuit seeking to overturn California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage -- is potentially vast. Unfortunately, that audience will have to wait. U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker had decided to allow the proceedings to be taped, then aired on YouTube.  But as the trial was set to begin Monday morning, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order blocking its broadcast. Our camera-phobic high court is making a mistake. Public access should be encouraged, not thwarted, in court cases involving divisive issues -- all the more so when judicial power is invoked in an effort to invalidate the outcome of a vote. Although some Supreme Court justices might worry that cameras in the courtroom undermine the legitimacy of the judicial process, the reality is just the opposite. The Prop 8 trial is a case in point. People on both sides of the same-sex marriage issue are accustomed to a political process coarsened by ideological rhetoric and political posturing. If they can view the Prop 8 trial via YouTube, they will be surprised by what they see: a decision-making process devoid of politics, in which a thoughtful and unbiased judge asks hard questions of both sides' lawyers in search of legal rules reflecting neutral principles, not political fiat. At a time when most Americans have lost confidence in the government's ability to act in the general interest, the potentially huge audience for the Prop 8 trial would see that at least one branch of government tries to make decisions on the merits. Broadcasting the trial will confer legitimacy on the proceedings as nothing else can. Legitimacy matters. If, in the end, Judge Walker upholds Prop 8, rejecting challenges to its constitutionality, opponents of the law will feel angry and aggrieved -- to put it mildly. But if they have viewed the trial online, they are less likely to feel victimized in a process that was politically rigged. Defenders of Prop 8 are against broadcasting the trial because they believe it would infringe on their right to a fair trial. They claim that release of videos on YouTube would expose participants to harassment. The concern about harassment is not trivial. Some financial contributors to the Prop 8 campaign were harassed following voter approval of the law in November 2008. Much as I disagree with their position on same-sex marriage, harassment infringes their First Amendment right to participate in the political process. But the trial judge is sensitive to these issues and would be able to minimize the risk of harassment. Under the camera access procedures adopted by Judge Walker, the court would control the video cameras and can make sure that certain witnesses are not shown on camera, if necessary. In any case, most trial participants are people who, because of their prominence in the electoral campaign, have chosen to have a high public profile on same-sex marriage. They expect to be recognized and identified with this issue. They have, or should have, thick skins. Their First Amendment right to join the political fray must be balanced against the public's First Amendment right to know what transpires in the  courtroom. There is no secret justice in the American judicial system. Courts must be open to assure the parties receive a fair trial and to give the public the necessary confidence that the laws are applied justly. To be sure, the First Amendment doesn't require public access to include television broadcast or online distribution. But when judges exercise their discretion to open their courtrooms to cameras, that choice should be upheld. Let's hope the Supreme Court quickly rescinds its order blocking online distribution of the Prop 8 trial video.

"(CNN) -- If you've ever had a group of friends who have meant the world to you, take a look at the old black-and-white photo that accompanies today's column. If you've ever yearned to freeze time, to make the finest moments of your life stand still in their tracks so you can savor them a little longer, while knowing somewhere inside that such a thing is impossible, take a look at the faces of those three men. Not so many years before that photo was snapped, the three of them were inseparable -- not only on a basketball court, but in the minds of hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of admirers. Their names routinely appeared in the same sentences in newspaper sports sections from coast to coast. They inhabited the same column of agate-type box scores on winter morning after winter morning. If you were young enough -- and, as the 12-year-old statistics kid who counted up their field goals, rebounds and free throws for the local Columbus, Ohio, television station that did the live broadcasts of their college games, I was young enough -- you allowed yourself to believe that the three friends would always be together. It wasn't to be. It almost never is, whether you are friends as famous as they were, or as anonymous as most of the rest of us are. Which is why I love that bittersweet photograph so much. It is an inadvertent record of a moment that signifies how all friends, eventually, must take different paths, that nothing beautiful is destined to endure uninterrupted. On the left in the photograph is Larry Siegfried of the Boston Celtics. In the center is Jerry Lucas of the Cincinnati Royals. On the right is John Havlicek of the Celtics. In 1960, the three had been teammates on The Ohio State University basketball team that won the national collegiate championship. It was quite a squad; the coach was Fred Taylor, the two other starters were Mel Nowell and Joe Roberts, and there was a sharpshooting forward who came off the bench, a rather intense young man by the name of Bobby Knight. The team was so smooth that, watching from the stands, you sensed they could read each others' minds. If you had never before quite understood what it looked like and felt like to be a part of a seamless unit, you found out every evening just by seeing them play. But the thing you could never really know -- the secret that belonged only to them, as it does with any group of friends -- was what it was like to be inside of it. They were separate people, but they were one. Which is why the photograph of them taken barely three years later -- it was shot on October 17, 1963, in the Cincinnati Gardens -- is, in its low-key way, so mesmerizing. The friends, because of circumstance, have parted. The paths have split. This was to be the first game during which, as professionals, they competed against each other. The old team was history. At the opening tipoff, their goals were about to diverge. The photo was snapped by a then-young man named Ed Keys, who had been taken to the game by his father, sportswriter Tom Keys. Ed Keys sent it to me recently because he thought I would understand. Fifty winters ago -- the winter that Lucas and Havlicek and Siegfried and their Ohio State teammates won their national championship -- I somehow, as a junior high school student who wasn't even that good at math, talked the local television play-by-play man, Jimmy Crum, into letting me sit with him and help with the statistics. I watched those friends on the court at every home game on their way to the championship; I watched that magical basketball friendship form and grow and become so strong that their team became the finest in the country. What must it be like to be part of a friendship that is played out so publicly -- part of hardwood recollections woven into the fabric of the lives of strangers who will never meet you? ""It's probably something the rest of us can never fully comprehend,"" said Lee Caryer, a sports historian who wrote the book ""The Golden Age of Ohio State Basketball,"" and who knows every member of that championship team. ""But I can tell you that the bond between them is real, and that they wear it very well. It goes way beyond basketball."" Most of us, if we are lucky enough when we are young to have friends whom we treasure, tend to lose track of some of them over time. Most of us have our own versions of that moment in the photograph: a moment when we suddenly know for sure that, despite our dreams and best intentions, the golden days when we first found each other have drifted off, and that we are on our way to somewhere else, somewhere different. But there always is the chance that we can recapture the memories. Later this month, in Columbus, the living members of that championship team will gather for a series of 50th anniversary celebrations. The three men in the photograph are all expected to be present. They started off as small-town Ohio boys who didn't even know that the others were alive: Jerry Lucas of Middletown, Larry Siegfried of Shelby, John Havlicek of Martins Ferry. They ended up as a part of each other. That's the lesson for all of us, as this new year takes its first faltering steps, and, all across the country, new friendships form and old ones seem to splinter. That's the lesson, full of hope and harmony: . The best friendships never truly die. We may go our separate ways, for a while. But the friendships not only lead the way home. The friendships are home. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Three players on 1960 college championship team went on to the NBA .

"(CNN) -- Friday marks the passage of one month since a magnitude-7.0 earthquake devastated Haiti. As thousands of Haitians gathered in the center of Port-au-Prince to remember what was lost that day, Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF, spoke to CNN's ""American Morning"" about the situation. ""We don't know how many actually were orphaned by the earthquake. There are so many children in Haiti without parental supervision who need to be cared for, who need to be fed, clothed and so forth and protected,"" she said. Tracking down the actual numbers in Haiti can be tough given the circumstances. Fact check: One month after the earthquake, what numbers are available to tell the story of devastation and recovery? • Human toll: The Haitian government says the quake claimed the lives of more than 212,000 people and injured more than 300,000. The U.S. Agency for International Development estimates that 3 million people were affected by the quake and 700,000 in Port-au-Prince were displaced. • Aid agencies: The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that more than 400 agencies were registered with the Haitian government to do work in Haiti before the quake. Because some of the non-governmental organizations are small and work in remote, rural areas, their presence may not even be known to the Haitian government. • Aid given: According to the U.N. humanitarian affairs office, more than 2.3 million people have received food aid from the World Food Programme and their partners, and more than 10,300 mosquito nets, 23,000 family tents, 26,500 kitchen sets and 79,500 blankets have been distributed. • Sanitation: The World Health Organization estimated this week that less than 5 percent of the need for latrines has been meet. However, there has not been an increase in reported infectious diseases. More than 900,000 people have access to safe drinking water, but that still falls short of the goal of providing water to 1.1 million. • Children: About 5,000 schools were destroyed or damaged in the quake. According to the U.N. humanitarian affairs office, the Haitian government aims to have all schools open again before the end of March. Kathleen Strottman, executive director of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, estimates that there were more than 900 orphans in the process of being adopted into American homes when the quake struck. Bottom line: One month after the most devastating earthquake in Haiti's history, the available numbers show a nation with great needs. However, the numbers also show that aid is reaching a large percentage of the people. Got something that needs checking? E-mail us at factcheck@cnn.com.

"(CNN) -- An earthquake with preliminary magnitude of 5.6 struck eastern Venezuela on Friday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake's epicenter was about 25 miles from Carupano, near the Caribbean coast in northeastern Venezuela, the agency said. It was 7 miles deep. The geological survey revised its estimates after initially reporting the quake as having a 5.7 magnitude and an epicenter slightly closer to Carupano. The revised location is about 235 miles east of the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Are you in Venezuela?

"(CNN) -- There are few sports that are so dominated by a single person like the way the women's pole vault is ruled by 26-year Russian Yelena Isinbayeva. Eyes on the prize: Yelena Isinbayeva has often complained about a lack of real competition in her event. Every time the world and Olympic champion competes it is expected that she will spring to new heights and push women's pole-vaulting to new levels. She has broken the world record 16 times, almost equaling the feat of the great Sergey Bubka, who broke the men's outdoor pole vault record 17 times between 1984 and 1994. Since jumping to her first world record in 2003 and becoming the first woman to jump over 5-meters in 2005 she as also become something of a glamorous sporting celebrity. After setting five new world records in 2005, it took almost three years for her to set a new mark of 5.04m in July 2008, a fallow period that made her pursuit of world records a personal matter. After setting her world record mark in July this year at a competition in Monte Carlo, she told press: ""I wanted to improve my personal best and that's what I did. I see this world record as a personal one."" A driven and focused competitor, she has also become famous for her coolness under pressure. Before her latest world record jump she was driving around the track in the back of a vintage car with sprinter Asafa Powell, while her fellow competitors had already started the competition. Not shy of media and publicity, her sporting achievements, athleticism and looks have made her a pin-up for women's athletics and attracted a number of big-name sponsors. While her achievements can be allied to that of Bubka it has been noted that her media- and sponsor-friendly attitude makes her more akin to compatriot Maria Sharapova. Her celebrity status is a world away from her modest background. Born in Volgograd in 1982 it was only until a couple of years ago that she lived with her parents and younger sister in the city of her birth, before moving to Monte Carlo. She trained first of all as a gymnast until the age of 15 when her coach decided she was too tall. Commentators and fellow competitors have noted that her gymnastic training has helped give her an extra edge in the event. After defending her title in Beijing, her place in the sporting pantheon of great female athletes seems secure. While emulating Bubka, Isinbayeva has said before that closing the gap between the heights the men and women can jump is another of her personal challenges, and with her own talent and the help of Bubka's former coach she may go a long way towards achieving that.","World and Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva dominates her sport .

"(CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner signed a decree Tuesday requiring all ships navigating from Argentina to the disputed Falkland Islands to carry a government permit. The move comes as tensions over the territory simmer because of British oil companies' efforts to drill off the northern coast of the islands. The Falklands, known as Las Malvinas in Argentina, lie in the South Atlantic Ocean off the Argentinean coast and have been under British rule since 1833. But Argentina has always claimed sovereignty over them. The two nations fought a war over the islands in 1982. Tuesday's decree followed an accusation made last week by the Argentine government that a ship docked on the mainland was preparing to transport tubes to the Falklands for oil and gas exploration. The decree also creates a special commission that will oversee the application of the new measure. ""It's public knowledge that the United Kingdom has started the search for hydrocarbon resources in the Falkland Islands area,"" Argentine Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez said at a news conference, according to the official Telam news agency. The Argentine position is that natural resources around the islands should be protected, and Britain must accept international resolutions labeling the Falklands a disputed area. ""This has to do with the defense of the interests of Argentineans, not just about sovereignty,"" Fernandez said, adding that Argentina lays claim not just to the islands, but to any resources that could be found there. The Argentines blame ""unilateral moves"" by the British companies toward exploration as the reason for the recent spat. ""The companies that are planning to explore and exploit gas and oil are going to be met with legal challenges because they are doing it on a continental shelf that Argentina maintains is our own,"" Argentine congressman Ruperto Godoy told CNN. CNN's Brian Byrnes and Claudia Dominguez contributed to this report.","Argentina requires ships navigating from Argentina to the Falklands to carry permit .

"(CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday his strategy in Afghanistan will have three objectives:  deny al Qaeda a safe haven, reverse the Taliban's momentum and strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government. Here is how he said he plans to achieve the goals: . • Send 30,000 additional U.S. troops . The U.S. will send 30,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in the next seven months ""so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population centers,"" Obama said in his speech. Some of the new troops will help train Afghan security forces to ""create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans,"" Obama said. U.S. forces could begin to leave as security responsibilities are transferred to the Afghans. Obama said he hopes to start transferring U.S. forces out of Afghanistan in July 2011. The U.S. troop buildup also will help secure areas that go relatively uncovered by U.S. and NATO forces now. Most of the new troops are expected to be sent around the southern part of Afghanistan, divided between Helmand and Kandahar provinces. Kandahar's one major city, also called Kandahar, is used by Taliban fighters and its leaders to hide within the population from coalition troops. One key task will be to control the major approaches to the city. Obama also said he is asking NATO allies to send more troops to Afghanistan. The new troop deployments would increase the total U.S. commitment to roughly 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, bolstered by more than 40,000 NATO forces. • Pursue a more effective civilian strategy . Obama said the U.S. would work to build up programs and institutions that will benefit Afghanistan's citizens. However, alluding to the corruption that has plagued the Afghan government, the aid ""must be based on performance,"" Obama said. Corruption in Afghanistan has shaken international and domestic confidence in the government there. Even this year's re-election of President Hamid Karzai was mired in controversy; he was declared the winner of an August vote that was deemed tainted with ballot-stuffing. In his inauguration speech, Karzai said he'd make the fight against corruption a top priority over the next five years. On Tuesday, Obama said that speech sent the right message, but he warned that ""the days of providing a blank check are over."" ""We will support Afghan ministries, governors and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people. We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to be held accountable,"" Obama said. Obama said the U.S. would focus its assistance ""in areas -- such as agriculture -- that can make an immediate impact in the lives of the Afghan people."" The U.S. also will support Afghanistan's efforts to reach out to Taliban fighters who want to lay down arms. Already, the U.S. has a plan to pay those fighters to quit the Taliban. There is money in the 2010 defense appropriations bill to fund a Taliban reintegration program, which essentially pays Taliban fighters to switch sides. The U.S. State Department says it plans to triple its civilian staff in Afghanistan to 974 members by early 2010. In a speech in New York on Monday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said U.S. civilian efforts are just as critical as military operations to help Afghanistan. USAID and other U.S. government agencies also have people in Afghanistan. Clinton said experts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are embedded with the U.S. military, and ""rule of law"" experts are working to extend a justice system ""so that the Taliban would not offer the only form of justice in Afghanistan."" • Have a more robust partnership with Pakistan . Taliban fighters have long been operating in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. It is not clear whether any of the additional troops will be sent to the Pakistan border, where the U.S. tries to stop Taliban and al Qaeda forces from moving between the two countries. About 4,000 U.S. Special Forces troops are in eastern Afghanistan, hunting al Qaeda leaders. Any plan to bolster Afghanistan must also work to help Pakistan, Obama said. ""We will strengthen Pakistan's capacity to target these groups that threaten our countries,"" Obama said. ""America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan's democracy and development."" In the past, Obama said, some in Pakistan have argued that the struggle against the Taliban and other militants wasn't Pakistan's fight. But the Pakistani army recently has been attacking the Taliban stronghold of South Waziristan after a series of deadly bomb attacks across the country. ""Public opinion has turned ... and there is no doubt that the United States and Pakistan share a common enemy,"" Obama said. ""Going forward, the Pakistani people must know: America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed,"" Obama said. CNN's Mike Mount, Larry Shaughnessy, Jill Dougherty and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Extra 30,000 U.S. troops to secure uncovered areas, help Afghan security forces train .
Troop buildup just one strategy to achieve goals in Afghanistan, Obama says .

"(Mashable) -- We've seen some major world events unfold on the social media stage in the past week, the biggest being Google's threat to pull out of China and the Haiti earthquake. Google's actions have brought attention back to the long-standing Internet censorship that blankets China, while the destruction in Haiti has mobilized hundreds of thousands to open their wallets and their hearts. Just like the Iran election crisis, those events are causing people to reassess the impact of social media on the world. It's clear that social media has the power to impact world politics and the lives of billions, but some have overstated what social media can actually do. We need to understand what social media really is in order to use it effectively for social good. iReport: Looking for loved ones in Haiti . Let me explain by highlighting a few examples of social media's impact on the world stage, and then concluding with how I view social media's impact in the larger context of mobilization and world discussion. Iran election crisis . During summer 2009, the world's eyes were fixated on Iran. Questions were raised after Ahmadinejad was declared the winner over rival Mousavi in Iran's Presidential elections. The abnormalities and potential tampering of the vote resulted in massive protests that engulfed the Islamic nation. Social media's role in the Iran Election Crisis started with #CNNFail, but that was only the beginning of social media's role. With the Iranian government clamping down on information and enforcing censorship, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube became the primary mediums for bringing information out of the conflicted nation and spreading notes between dissidents. Take a look at the Iran election social media timeline we built if you want to see its full impact. Key moments in the crisis, especially the death of Neda, were recorded and spread like wildfire, creating an outpouring of support for the protesters. Twitter's role was so important in fact that the U.S. government got involved in scheduling Twitter's downtime. In the end though, social media didn't topple any governments, although it has helped shift the political climate in Iran. In some cases the use of Twitter in Iran was overstated, yet the result is that the tipping point for Iran is close, thanks to social media. Haiti earthquake . After a magnitude 7.0 earthquake (and multiple aftershocks) devastated the nation of Haiti, social media became the medium in which everybody spread the word. Dramatic Haiti earthquake Twitter pictures swept across the Web, while tech giants mobilized. iReport: Earthquake rocks Haiti . The most impressive part of social media's impact on Haiti has to be the charity text message campaign that has already raised more than $10 million for Haiti victim relief. Social media spread the word. Technology made it possible. It's not all perfect, though: the money raised is small compared to the relief coming from world governments and donations face 90 day delays. Still, social media for social good is becoming more effective with each crisis. China-Google standoff . While we are still far from the conclusion of this messy affair, Google's threat to pull out of China has already had a dramatic effect in both social media and political circles. Politically, China has been put under pressure. The U.S. government has thrown its support behind Google, though it's doubtful that the Obama Administration will get involved in the end. More importantly though, social media is being used to lift China's blanket of censorship. Social tools, while many are blocked by the Chinese, can get through China's great firewall. We have the tools to undo censorship in China. Google's efforts have re-ignited the debate over censorship, but they won't break the barrier. Social media's global impact . In all three cases -- China, Haiti and Iran -- social media has had an impact, especially as the course of events evolved. Real-time communication platforms like Twitter and Facebook have spread the word about what's happening within these nations, long before the mainstream media prints the story. These tools have also created a level awareness we've never seen before. iReport: I'm alive! Messages from Haiti . We have to be realistic, though: New media isn't going to stop censorship, overthrow oppressive regimes or heal the people of Haiti alone. Social media has transformed communication, media, and the transmission of information, but it still takes people on the ground to pull people out of the rubble or to fight for freedom. Just as Paul Revere embarked on his midnight ride to warn that the British were coming, social media acts as both the first warning and the rallying cry for mobilization. In the end though, social media is just a collection of tools. It's up to us, the people, to make the real impact on our world. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- American skating star Apolo Anton Ohno snatched a record-breaking silver medal at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver after a final-lap crash by his South Korean rivals in the 1,500 meters race, while skier Hannah Kearney gave the United States a first gold medal in Saturday's final event. Ohno, who won gold at Salt Lake City in 2002, looked to be out of the medals as Jung-Su Lee, Si-Bak Sung and Ho-Suk Lee were poised to complete a clean sweep in the men's short-track race. But Ho-Suk Lee was disqualified from the six-man final after cutting across his compatriots on the final turn, with Jung-Su Lee escaping the debacle to claim gold ahead of Ohno, while J.R. Celski gave the U.S. a bronze medal. The 27-year-old Ohno earned his sixth Winter Olympics medal, making him the most successful U.S. male competitor as he overtook long-track star Eric Heiden, and leaving him equal overall with female skating legend Bonnie Blair. Canada's second-ranked Charles Hamelin had to make do with victory in the B Final after failing to qualify for the main race. Blog: Opening ceremony flawed but perfect . Jung-Su Lee had edged out Ohno in winning their semifinal, with his fellow Koreans coming top in theirs. Kearney, by comparison to Ohno, won her first Olympic medal as she edged out defending champion Jennifer Heil of Canada to win gold in the final run of the ladies' freestyle moguls event, with American Shannon Bahrke taking the bronze. Kearney, the 2005 world champion, made up for her disappointing effort four years ago as she continued the form that saw her win the last World Cup event before the Olympics in Lake Placid two weeks ago. Her points tally of 26.63 lifted her above Heil's 25.69, which gave hosts Canada a first medal, with U.S. national champion Bahrke tallying 25.43 to add to her silver medal from Turin in 2002. Ski-jumping . Switzerland's Simon Ammann earlier claimed the first gold medal of the 2010 Games when he won the opening men's ski-jumping event on Saturday, while Dutch skater Sven Kramer took out the first title on ice in a record time. The 28-year-old Ammann secured his third career Olympic victory, following two golds in 2002, as he triumphed in the normal hill competition. Ammann led after the first round and then, as the last man to leap in the final session, produced a huge jump of 108 meters at Whistler Olympic Park. He finished with a total of 276.5 points to push Poland's Adam Malysz into the silver medal position. ""Life does not always go the way you want it to. This is why I want to cherish the moments, and I've had a lot of luck in my career and also today,"" Ammann, who was in 2002 nicknamed the ""Harry Potter of ski-jumping"" due to his likeness to J.K. Rowling's boy wizard, told reporters. Malysz had been on top after a jump of 105 meters which, when boosted by the style judges' marks, put him ahead of bronze medal winner Gregor Schlierenzauer of Austria, who had leaped 106.5 meters. Malysz finished on a total of 269.5 points, with Schlierenzauer on 268. Speedskating . Kramer earned the 5,000 meters speed skating title with an Olympic record time of six minutes and 14.60 seconds. The 23-year-old world champion went one better than his silver medal at Turin 2006 as he finished 2.35 seconds ahead of South Korea's Lee Seung-Hoon. ""I started fast, but I was dying in the end. It was probably my hardest and best race ever,"" Kramer said. Ivan Skobrev of Russia won the bronze medal in 6:18.05, while defending champion Chad Hendrick of the United States finished way back in 11th. Biathlon . The first women's gold medal of the Games was claimed by Slovakia's Anastazia Kuzmina, who triumphed in the biathlon 7.5 kilometer sprint event. She became the first athlete from the East European nation to win at a Winter Olympics, with her winning time of 19 minutes and 55.6 seconds heading off Germany's Magdalena Neuner in second place (19:57.1). ""It's a big surprise. I didn't expect to win, however I'm in good shape,"" Kuzmina said. Marie Dorin of France won bronze in the event, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting, with a time of 20:06.5. Ice Hockey . In the opening women's ice hockey match, 2006 silver medallists Sweden defeated Switzerland 3-0 at the UBC Thunderbird Arena. Goals in each of the first three periods from Danijela Rundqvist, Tina Enstrom and Erica Uden Johansson sealed victory in the Group A match. Hosts and defending champions Canada demolished Slovakia 18-0 in Saturday's other Group A fixture to break the record they set in defeating Italy 16-0 in 2006. Alpine skiing . Meanwhile, the men's alpine skiing downhill competition at Whistler Creekside scheduled for Saturday has been postponed until Monday due to adverse weather. Skiing's blue riband event was supposed to open the program, but overnight snow and rain followed by mild temperatures made conditions unsuitable. American Bode Miller, the 2005 world champion, will be seeking to win his first Olympic gold, having claimed two silvers on home soil at Salt Lake City in 2002. Sunday's women's super-combined and slalom skiing events have also been postponed after the competitors were unable to complete practice runs on Saturday. American medal hope Lindsey Vonn has entered in both disciplines, among five she will be competing in, having shrugged off recent injury problems.","Skier Hannah Kerney claims first U.S. gold medal of Winter Olympics in ladies' moguls .

"(CNN)  -- Federal investigators are concerned a potential danger persists because of the simultaneous use of intersecting runways at Newark Liberty International Airport, one of the nation's busiest and a gateway to the New York metro area. The alert comes after repeated instances in which planes above the Newark airport flew too close to each other in violation of safety standards. There were four such instances last year and at least four this year, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general. In one case, on January 16, 2008, two Continental planes -- a Boeing B-737 and an Embraer 145 -- missed each other by 600 feet, according to a DOT inspector general's report. ""That was very scary. I was there for that one personally in the control tower, and it scared the heck out of everybody up there,"" said Ray Adams, a Newark air traffic controller. Potential danger arises when approaching planes need to abort their landings, which happens about every 700 flights at Newark, according to a Federal Aviation Administration analysis. In what the FAA calls ""go-arounds,"" the diverted plane approaching Newark has to make a sharp right turn through the flight path of planes landing and taking off from an intersecting runway, allowing little margin for error. ""There was a distinct possibility that we could have had a collision with these operations,"" Adams said. Adams said he raised the safety issue to the FAA but got nowhere. He persisted, taking his complaint to New Jersey's congressional delegation, which organized two meetings last year with FAA officials. In response, Adams said, he was punished, put on paid leave for 11 months, then leave without pay for a month. The FAA said the disciplinary actions had nothing to do with Adams' safety complaints. Adams filed a whistle-blower complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, the agency that investigates whistle-blower complaints. Adams' complaint led DOT Inspector General Calvin Scovel to investigate. Scovel found merit in Adams' concerns, concluding in a report two months ago that ""questions about the safety of the runway 22L-11 approach configuration at Newark persist."" In response, the FAA promised to use a computer program that helps air traffic controllers stagger aircraft to ensure proper spacing. On November 5, the DOT wrote to the Office of Special Counsel confirming the computer system had been put to use at Newark on October 26. The next day the Office of Special Counsel learned the technology was no longer in use at Newark. ""I am outraged,"" said Rep. Donald Payne, D-New Jersey. ""When you put into jeopardy the human lives at risk, it can't get any more serious than that."" FAA spokesperson Laura Brown said, ""There was no intent to deceive anyone about what we were doing."" She added, ""FAA safety officers wanted to make absolutely sure employees were fully trained on the equipment."" The FAA said it intends to have the computer system fully operational at Newark by mid-December. Last week the Office of Special Counsel raised the matter with President Obama, writing that ""we found a substantial likelihood that FAA officials were engaging in conduct that constitutes gross mismanagement and a substantial and specific danger to public safety."" Meanwhile, after a year out of the control tower, Adams returned to his regular job Wednesday at Newark air traffic control.","Concerns cited about potential danger of using intersecting runways at Newark .

"(CNN) -- Pennsylvania police have arrested a woman who authorities say fled Washington state 11 years ago with her two sons against a court order instructing her to return them to their father, police said. Jill Haugen was arrested at her home in Milton, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, days after she had contacted police saying she didn't want to take care of her sons any longer, Milton Police Chief Craig Lutcher told CNN. Police in Spokane, Washington, said a felony warrant for first-degree custodial interference was issued for her in 1998. The Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, district attorney's office said she has been charged with being a fugitive from justice and is awaiting an extradition hearing. It was not immediately clear if she had retained legal representation. Police made two trips to her house after her Saturday phone call, Lutcher said, and the sons, now ages 15 and 16, were placed into foster care after the second visit, on Sunday. A caseworker discovered through an Internet search that there was a warrant from Washington state for Haugen's arrest and told police, Lutcher said. Police said Haugen had provided them with two different names on two different occasions. Haugen, who was known as Jill Connington when she was married to Bill Connington, did not win primary custody of the couple's children in 1998 after the two had divorced, police in Spokane said. ""They were with her on a visitation and she never brought them back,"" Spokane police Lt. Dave McGovern said. When she disappeared, according to police, the felony warrant for first-degree custodial interference was issued for her, police said. Bill Connington told CNN that he was a ""little overwhelmed with everything."" ""I've had thoughts of possibly never seeing [his sons] again but never gave up hope I would,"" he said. He said he was speaking with caseworkers about getting the teenagers to Washington. As she was escorted by police, Haugen told media she was a domestic abuse survivor and that her two sons were sexual abuse survivors. It was not immediately clear against whom she was leveling the sexual abuse accusations. ""We've been in this state since 2000,"" she said. ""We are legal residents."" McGovern said a sexual abuse allegation was filed in 1995 on behalf of the children, but authorities were not able to substantiate anything from it. Asked about the abuse, Connington denied any wrongdoing and said he had offered during the custody hearings to do whatever he needed to prove his innocence. CNN's Shirley Zilberstein contributed to this report.","Jill Haugen accused of illegally leaving Washington state with her sons in 1998 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Ailing ""Great Train Robber"" Ronnie Biggs -- one of the most notorious British criminals of the 20th century -- was formally released from prison to his death bed Friday after being granted his freedom on compassionate grounds. Ronnie Biggs, pictured at a book launch in Rio de Janeiro in 1994. Biggs, who is gravely ill with severe pneumonia, is being cared for at a hospital in Norwich, eastern England, where he was moved on Tuesday. Three prison staff who had been assigned to Biggs' bedside have been withdrawn following UK Justice Minister Jack Straw's decision to authorize his release, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson told CNN. ""The medical evidence clearly shows that Mr Biggs is very ill and that his condition has deteriorated recently, culminating in his re-admission to hospital,"" Straw said in a statement Thursday. ""His condition is not expected to improve."" Biggs' son, Michael Biggs, said his father was ""over the moon"" that he had been released on the eve of his 80th birthday. Speaking to reporters outside the hospital, he confirmed his father had been handed his release papers. ""As a family, we are absolutely thrilled,"" Michael Biggs said, according to the UK's Press Association. Biggs is unable to walk, barely able to communicate and no longer able to eat or drink, Michael Biggs said, adding that the family was ""very hopeful that my father will be able to survive the next few days."" Biggs' legal advisor Giovanni Di Stefano told journalists that Biggs was unlikely to ever leave his hospital bed. ""This man is ill, he's going to die... he is going to stay in hospital,"" he said. Saturday also marks the 46th anniversary of the infamous 1963 heist dubbed the ""crime of the century"" that transformed Biggs from a petty London thief into one of the most wanted men in Britain. Biggs and 14 other professional criminals made off with more than £2.5 million ($4.2 million) in used bank notes -- the equivalent of around £40 million ($67 million) today -- after holding up a mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of the morning. In the course of the robbery the train driver was badly beaten with an iron bar. Most of the gang, including Biggs, were soon picked up in a massive manhunt after police discovered fingerprints at a farmhouse hideout where the robbers had holed up to split their spoils. Biggs was sentenced to 30 years in prison but escaped over the wall of a London prison after serving just 15 months -- and spent most of the rest of his life as a celebrity fugitive. After undergoing extensive plastic surgery in Paris, Biggs made his way to Australia, living there with his wife and two children. Tracked down by police, Biggs fled again in 1969, this time to Brazil. Five years later, Biggs was traced once more by a newspaper reporter. Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Jack Slipper, who had led police efforts to bring the train robbers to justice, flew out to Rio de Janeiro to arrest Biggs, allegedly greeting him at a beachside hotel: ""Long time no see, Ronnie."" But efforts to bring Biggs home were frustrated because by then he had fathered a Brazilian-born son -- Michael Biggs -- and authorities rejected British requests for his extradition. Biggs continued to live openly in Rio, trading on his notoriety by entertaining tourists, selling t-shirts and even recording with the Sex Pistols. In 1981 he was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers and smuggled to Barbados. But legal efforts to have Biggs brought back to the UK once again stalled and he was allowed to return to Brazil. By the late 1990s Biggs was in poor health following a series of strokes and running out of cash. In 2001 he flew back to the UK on a private jet laid on by the Sun newspaper. He was promptly locked up in a high security prison but then moved to a facility for elderly prisoners. Since his return Biggs and his family have campaigned for his parole on compassionate grounds -- an appeal until now rejected by successive justice ministers on the grounds that Biggs had never shown any remorse for his actions. Michael Biggs said his father had expressed regret for the robbery -- but not for the life he had led in the years since the crime.","Ronnie Biggs freed on compassionate grounds because of ailing health .

"(Wired) -- A year after its release, Google's open source Android operating system has become a sensation. After a slow start, it is now available on at least 12 phones, with more devices waiting in the wings. Good news for Android fans, right? Not really, say some developers. A slew of problems have made managing Android apps a ""nightmare,"" they say, including three versions of the OS (Android 1.5, 1.6 and 2.0), custom firmware on many phones, and hardware differences between different models. For users, it means apps in the store could be buggy, might not work well depending on their handsets, and could deliver a frustrating experience. Unaware of the increasing back-end complexity, they would then be more likely to leave bad reviews for those apps -- a potentially lethal blow for small businesses, say developers. ""Instead of working on updates to our apps, we find we are trying to make each app work for multiple versions of the OS and different hardware capabilities,"" says Chris Fagan, co-founder at Froogloid, an Android-focused application development company. ""We are not complaining about all the growth, but if you are a small or a new Android developer coming in and trying to learn I could see your head exploding. It would be overwhelming,"" he says. The problem echoes similar concerns over Java in the 1990s. Originally touted as a way for developers to build apps that would run on any computer (""write once, run anywhere""), developers found that wide variations in Java virtual machines as well as available hardware meant that Java's promise was really ""write once, debug everywhere."" While Java is still used -- particularly in the mobile space, where it powers games and other apps written for Java-capable cellphones -- it is not nearly the cross-platform panacea it was originally conceived as. Fagan's concern about the fragmentation of Android is being echoed by other developers, says Sean Galligan, vice president of business development at Flurry, an mobile app analytics company. ""There's no question that we are starting to hear developers express concern,"" says Galligan. ""Android is growing very fast and there's a lot of excitement for it but it's also a lot for work, especially for medium and small developers."" Since the launch of the first HTC T-Mobile G1 phone running Android OS, a number of handset makers have jumped on the bandwagon. HTC alone has five Android handsets available, while others like Motorola have shifted completely to the Android platform. In the past two months, Motorola released two new Android-based handsets, the Cliq and Droid. And in a bid to differentiate themselves, handset makers are creating custom user interfaces like the HTC Sense, the Motorola Blur and the Rachael UI from Sony Ericsson. Android phones vary significantly in the hardware, too -- phones with and without camera flash, some have physical keyboards, others don't. ""You may build an app that works perfectly with all three firmwares, but then when you run it on carriers' ROMs it completely blows up,"" says Fagan. ""So we find ourselves having to create apps that are compatible with multiple firmwares, multiple ROMs and multiple devices with different hardware."" It's in sharp contrast to the iPhone platform. Apple has tightly controlled the introduction of new iPhones and updates to its operating system. It has just three iPhone models available since it first introduced the phone in 2007. And all iPhone users are prompted to update their phones to be on the same version of the operating system. While Apple pioneered the app store idea with the iPhone, Android, too, offers Market, a store for distribution of third-party programs. Unlike with the Apple app store, Android developers do not have to go through an approval process to get their apps on the Android Market. Currently, the Android market has about 10,000 apps compared to the 100,000 in Apple's app store. For developers, Apple's autocratic ways may be frustrating, but they can pay off. ""Apple maintains an iron grip on what they do and there's an advantage to that,"" says Kelly Schrock, owner of Fognl, which has three apps on the Android market. ""IPhone developers don't have to worry about fragmentation and creating apps for the iPhone is much easier."" Founded about the same time as the first Android phone hit the market, Froogloid today has more than 100,000 users across its three apps: a2b, Key Ring and CowPotato. But with Android's growth, managing these apps is becoming quite a challenge, says Fagan. The diversity of devices running Android OS has led to some unexpected results, says Fagan. For instance, the Sprint HTC Hero was launched without its GPS setting turned on. When run, the a2b application could trigger it -- but Froogloid soon found that the standard commands they used reacted differently on the Hero than on other Android devices. Instead of launching the GPS settings, it set off the ""screen unlock pattern"" settings, says Chris Pick, requiring Froogloid to write custom code in their app for that particular device. Google says it has emulators available that allows developers to test their application running on simulated devices so they can see how it behaves. But it doesn't always work, says Fagan. ""In a sense, we are shooting blind with the emulators because we have no idea how it is really working on the device."" For instance, explains Pick, the graphics for their 3D game app, Cowpotato worked fine on the emulator but crashed when run on Motorola's Droid phone. Pick suspects a bug in the graphics driver on the Droid. Writing for a fix for it took care of the problem but its not the best solution, he says. ""When we have to start writing rules based on the phone model in our code, it adds more code to our code base, creates more work for us and makes the app heavier,"" says Pick. Different versions of the OS also means new functionality is added or some removed. Understanding these changes and making software backward compatible takes time, say Schrock. ""It's a multiplication of work to support all of them."" A bigger problem is the customization of firmware or custom ROMs. For instance, Google offers a basic homescreen with the Android code. But device manufacturers or network carriers can always modify it. Sometimes the changes are simple, such as replacing all white color with grey, or red with yellow. That allows handset makers and carriers to tailor Android better for their customers, something that Google says it supports ""strongly."" ""That isn't a big deal,"" says Fagan. ""However, when they start changing fundamentally how certain activities are controlled, such as user settings and screen orientation, it creates issues for developers that have built their apps on an out of the box version of the firmware/SDK."" Custom ROMs are always available for developers to look through, points out Froogloid. ""Google has mandated that every one base their releases on the standard versions,"" says Pick.""But this slips under the radar."" Ultimately, developers will have to start making tough decisions on who they want to target and versions of the operating system they want to support, says Galligan. ""Developers have to identify which devices and carriers appeal to the market they are creating an app for and develop just for it,"" he says. A one-man band, Schrock says without any employees he can't maintain four different app versions. ""It's getting a lot riskier on the Android. It's not 4x increase in the cost but it will be a lot more work."" And while Schrock says the apps are not his meal ticket, he doesn't want to make choices that could cut off some Android users from his apps. ""I will have to decide then how much return I am getting and if it is worth it."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- Some Americans visiting or working in Haiti have not been heard from since Tuesday's earthquake, but loved ones back home are trying to remain optimistic as good reports come in from others. CNN iReporter Cynthia Kivland of Prairie Grove, Illinois, spent a sleepless night trying to get in touch with her 30-year-old daughter, Chelsey. Chelsey Kivland has lived in Haiti for more than two years and speaks fluent Creole; she just returned there from a visit home in December. The Fulbright Scholar at the University of Chicago is finishing her doctoral dissertation in anthropology. ""She's just a beautiful person,"" said her mother, who contacted the State Department and the university for help. Help the Kivlands find their daughter . There are about 45,000 Americans in Haiti, the U.S. State Department estimates. A 15-member group from Trinity United Methodist Church of Hackettstown, New Jersey, turned up after going missing for about 18 hours after the quake. The group was believed to be at an orphanage in Bon Repos, 15 miles north of Port-au-Prince, when the earthquake struck. At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, a church member said the group contacted the church via a CNN satellite phone in Haiti. A message on the church's Web site said that a two- to three-day lag in communication is not unusual after natural disasters. Skip Conover of the Presbyterian Church of Lawrenceville, New Jersey, said a 21-member team of congregation members from his church, Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton and Kingdom Church of Ewing has been out of contact. ""We have heard absolutely nothing from our group,"" he said. ""If everything was on schedule, the team should have landed three hours before the earthquake in Port-au-Prince. Our fingers are crossed that if there were no holdups in customs and no stopgaps, the team should have been up the mountains and reached the village of Thoman before the quake happened."" Thoman is a two-hour drive from Port-au-Prince, and phone communication is not good from there, he said. Are you looking for loved ones? Two Americans with another church were rescued from the rubble of their mission house. Jillian Thorp and Charles Dietsch of the Catholic Diocese of Norwich, Connecticut, were pulled from the remains of the three-story house after a night of digging by four mission workers, Thorp's father said. ""It was heroic. I think that's the only word for it,"" said the father, Clay Cook, of Old Saybrook, Connecticut. Watch Cook tell the story . ""Jill couldn't really do anything for herself, except she did have her cell phone, so she was able to talk to people and tell them where within the house she and this other gentleman, Chuck Dietsch, were located, so they didn't have to look through the whole pile of rubble."" Thorp's husband, Frank, arrived after driving all night from another town, ""and he literally lifted her out of the hole when they finally got her free,"" Cook said. When he spoke to her less than an hour later, ""she was a little shaky,"" Cook said. ""She spent about 11 hours buried in concrete, listening to the earth shake around her, so being a little shaky is probably pretty good."" At a news conference later, Cook and his wife, Karen, asked reporters to turn their attention to those who are still suffering and grieving. ""It's a beautiful country, and they're a beautiful people, and they need a lot of help right now,"" he said. He said his daughter does not want to leave Haiti in its hour of need. ""Our baby is safe, but there's so many babies that aren't safe,"" a tearful Karen Cook said. The pastoral staff at Free Chapel, a nondenominational church in Gainesville, Georgia, used Skype on Tuesday night to reach Bobby and Sherry Burnette, the couple who run the church's permanent mission in Haiti, Executive Pastor Richie Hughes said. ""Our work there suffered different levels of damage,"" Hughes said. ""The housing areas are OK, minor damage, but one of the churches connected was destroyed."" A group led by Free Chapel's senior pastor, Jentezen Franklin, had to cancel a flight to Haiti planned for 6 a.m. Wednesday, Hughes said. He added that a special Haiti relief collection would be taken up at Wednesday evening's service. Lumiere Ministries of Gastonia, North Carolina, runs a 30-bed hospital and an orphanage in Port-au-Prince. President and CEO Hank Haskins said that all 25 employees are fine. The ministry was scheduled to do the official ribbon cutting for a new hospital in February. The group sent a container of supplies Tuesday and is awaiting word on its arrival. A group from the University of Wisconsin, Engineers Without Borders-UW, posted a blog Tuesday saying the quake had had minimal effect where they have been staying since arriving Sunday. A representative wasn't sure how many were in the group. Americans seeking information on missing loved ones can call 888-407-4747 for assistance, officials said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration Wednesday proposed a $2.9 million fine against American Eagle Airlines for allegedly conducting more than 1,100 flights using planes with landing-gear doors that had not been repaired as prescribed by the FAA. The proposed fine comes just weeks after the FAA proposed a $2.5 million fine against the airline for allegedly operating flights without adequately ensuring that the weight of baggage was properly calculated. The Fort Worth, Texas-based American Eagle -- a regional affiliate of American Airlines -- flew four Bombardier regional jets on more than 1,100 flights between February and May 2008, with main landing-gear doors that had not been repaired as ordered by the FAA in August 2006, the FAA said. ""Following Airworthiness Directives [repair orders] is not optional,"" FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in a statement. ""The FAA does not hesitate to levy fines if maintenance standards are violated."" American Eagle responded that it was disappointed in the FAA's actions, saying the airline did not endanger the public and it considered a fine unwarranted. The repair order required airlines to inspect landing-gear doors and take necessary action, fixing the doors or replacing them with new ones. In this case, American Eagle found damage on four aircraft, but rather than removing the doors as required, the airline repaired them while they remained on the planes. American Eagle said it self-disclosed to the FAA that repairs were performed while the landing-gear doors remained on the aircraft, a process that the FAA and the aircraft manufacturer subsequently approved, the company said. American Eagle subsequently removed the landing-gear doors on each of the affected aircraft and repaired them in accordance with the Airworthiness Directive. The airline said it will meet with the FAA to discuss the matter. The proposed fines are the latest in a string of multimillion dollar fines the FAA has proposed against airlines for failing to follow repair orders. In October, the FAA proposed to fine US Airways $5.4 million and United $3.8 million for other maintenance violations. In March, Southwest Airlines agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle a complaint that it flew unsafe planes.","FAA seeks $2.9 million from Texas-based regional affiliate of American Airlines .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Families all over the country are tightening their belts during this economic crisis, but some people are actually finding that cutting back can lead to richer lives. The Heinz family makes a net income of $58,000 a year -- but they have $70,000 in savings. The Heinz family makes a net income of $58,000 a year -- but they have $70,000 in savings. How did they do it? Sue Heinz is a stay-at-home mom with four children living in Sarasota, Florida. To keep their family out of financial worry, she and her husband, Brett, have gotten thrifty. With a prepaid cell phone used only for emergencies, the family's monthly bill is just $5. By brown bagging his lunch and carpooling to work, Brett spends little money during the work week and saves $122 each month on gas. Sue has found a way to snip $550 from their yearly budget by cutting the family's hair herself. And with a little online research, Brett found out how to do his own home repairs and says he has saved more than $6,000. Sue says their thriftiness began 11 years ago when she and Brett first moved to Florida on a teacher's salary. ""We had goals,"" she says. ""We wanted to own a home, we wanted to have a big family -- and we knew we had to set our priorities to make that work."" The ride hasn't been all smooth sailing, and Sue says they incurred some credit card debt along the way. ""But I'm very happy to say, and proud to say, that we're paying it back at nearly three times the minimum balance,"" she says. Oprah.com: How to get out of credit card debt . Although they've had to cut back in certain areas, Sue says their thrifty ways haven't curbed their lifestyle one bit. ""We go to the beach once a week, we go bike riding with the kids, we do all kinds of fun things,"" she says. ""There are second-run movie theaters; there are a lot of ways to have fun without spending money."" ""It's an alternative to living beyond our means, really,"" Brett says. ""Instead of spending too much money on things, we just make choices."" Sandberg family . On the other end of the spectrum, the Sandberg family is learning the need to cut back for the first time. Vicky and Mark have been married for 15 years and have two children. Until recently, the family has always brought in a double income. ""Times in the construction industry have been really tough, and four months ago I lost my job as a recruiter and as a trainer,"" Vicky says. With about 40 percent of their total income gone, the family has a new set of stress. Vicky and Mark say they've had to cut back their investment contributions toward their children's college funds and froze their individual retirement accounts. ""My personal biggest fear is losing what we have, what we've worked so hard for,"" Mark says. Can thrifty couple Sue and Brett help Vicky and Mark find ways to cut back? They begin with the Sandbergs' monthly budget and discover the Sandbergs are spending $650 a month in department stores on things for the kids -- clothing, video games and DVDs. ""That's a big number,"" Sue says. In addition, the Sandbergs are spending $190 each month on their phone, Internet and cable bill and $350 a month eating out at restaurants. All in all, the family is spending $8,744 a month, which is more than they are bringing in. To get Vicky and Mark on track, Sue says they need to bring their monthly budget down to less than $8,000 per month. Sue gives them a basket for storing their daily receipts and a journal to write down their needs and wants. ""You're going to take a good look and start to become extremely aware of where this money is going,"" she says. First to go are all but one of Vicky and Mark's credit cards -- for emergencies only -- in exchange for a debit card with a rewards program. ""I love the idea of having a debit card and paying as you go,"" Mark says. ""I think that would relieve a lot of stress at the end of the month."" Because Vicky and Mark have two cell phones, Sue suggests dropping their landline and finds a cable company that offers a better deal. They instantly save more than $100 a month!

Sue says the family can still enjoy eating out -- with the proper research. By searching online, Sue says you can find restaurants that let kids eat for free on certain nights of the week. ""Google your town's name plus 'free stuff' or 'kids' free meals,' and things pop up,"" she says. Sue also has a tip to save money on the DVDs the kids ask for -- go to the library and rent the DVD for free! In all, Sue and Brett helped Vicky and Mark find an extra $2,000 a month. ""It felt great because we didn't know what we were spending,"" Vicky says. ""It's really a mind-set. Mark and I have worked very hard to have what we have for our family and provide for them, but he'd spend what he'd spend, I would spend what I would spend and we'd pay the bill at the end of the month, and we just weren't paying attention.""

"(CNN) -- Airlines are uncertain about when commercial service to disaster-ravaged Haiti will resume. In the meantime, some carriers are organizing relief efforts. American Airlines canceled its five round-trip flights on Wednesday and Thursday. The airline is allowing passengers with plans to travel to Haiti this month to change their plans without fee or penalty through February 14, spokesman Tim Smith said in an e-mail. ""We are completely out of Haiti today, no scheduled operations -- we don't know yet for how long,"" he said. American Airlines plans to offer its frequent flier program members mileage incentives for contributing to the Red Cross, Smith said. The carrier flew three American Eagle aircraft into Haiti on Wednesday carrying 30,000 pounds of relief supplies for airline employees and local hospitals and aid efforts. The airline plans to send more relief flights on Thursday and Friday. ""The airport tower is badly damaged, and while I don't know the precise status of the runway, flights (including ours and Air France's) did make it out last night,"" Smith said Wednesday afternoon. U.S. Embassy staff at the Port-au-Prince airport said the tower and the lights were working, U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Wednesday. Spirit Airlines, which operates one flight a day between Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and  Port-au-Prince also canceled Wednesday and Thursday flights. Customers with reservations for travel to, from or through Haiti between Wednesday, January 13, and Sunday, January 17, may rebook their travel without penalty, provided the new departure is on or before February 7, according to Spirit's Web site. The airline will waive the change fee for travelers who move their travel beyond February 7, but it will charge for any difference in fare. The airline plans to resume service as soon as the airport in Port-au-Prince reopens. ""At this time we don't know when we'll be able to get flights in and out,"" Spirit spokeswoman Misty Pinson said via e-mail. The airline will give 5,000 free Spirit miles to the first 200,000 members of its frequent flier program who donate at least $5 to UNICEF, the Red Cross or Yéle Haiti. Members must register online to participate. Delta Air Lines has canceled its only flight Wednesday in and out of Port-au-Prince from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. There are no details on when the airline will resume commercial service, spokesman Anthony Black said. JetBlue Airways does not fly into Haiti, but the airline is waiving change fees and fare differences for passengers scheduled to fly into neighboring Dominican Republic on Wednesday. The airline's operations in the Dominican Republic have not been disrupted, but customers who don't feel comfortable flying can move their flights back, spokeswoman Alison Croyle said. Passengers who were scheduled to fly to, from or through Puerto Plata, Santiago or Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic on Wednesday may cancel without penalty and receive a full refund or reschedule to fly Thursday or Friday with no fees, Croyle said.","American Airlines cancels its Wednesday and Thursday flights to Haiti .

"Washington (CNN) -- In Latin America, Cuba stands out as one of the most effective deployers of soft power. Rather than exporting revolution, Cuba today exports doctors -- with more than 30,000 Cuban doctors working in more than 100 underdeveloped countries around the world. Cuba has become a marquee provider of catastrophe-related medical assistance around the world, particularly after tsunamis, hurricanes and earthquakes -- and no doubt will send large contingents of medical personnel to earthquake-ravaged Haiti in coming days and weeks. Moving beyond the still active Cold War stasis in U.S.-Cuba relations is an Obama administration foreign policy priority, and the devastation in Haiti provides a platform not only to provide relief for a nearby nation in desperate circumstances, but also to build confidence between Cuban and American authorities in a potential collaboration of effort in a third country. Many great American voices -- from Brent Scowcroft and George Shultz to Jackson Browne and Bill Richardson -- have said that the U.S. embargo on Cuba makes no sense as foreign policy, that the right of Americans to travel anywhere in the world should not be suspended in the case of Cuba, and that Cuba's exports of doctors rather than arms should be more than enough reason to strike Cuba off of America's state sponsors of terror watch list. But change in a relationship as charged and historically toxic as between Fidel Castro's Cuba and 11 U.S. presidents will take narratives to move. One such narrative could evolve from tying American resource coordination and financial support in a regional multilateral effort with other Latin American nations -- particularly Cuba's deep bench of natural disaster-experienced medical corps. After Hurricane Katrina pounded New Orleans and southern Mississippi, Castro offered relief support from a 1,600-person medical team called the Henry Reeves Brigade, named after an American doctor who fought in Cuba's war of independence. The U.S. predictably turned down the offer in September 2005. Shortly after, in October 2005, the Reeves Brigade was dispatched to help provide much-needed medical relief after the devastating Kashmir earthquake that tore through the Himalayan mountain region along Pakistan and Kashmir. The United States and Europe each sent teams of doctors to Pakistan, each with one base camp deployed for a month. The Cubans deployed seven major base camps and 30 field hospitals in the fundamentalist Islamic region of Pakistan, a nation with which Cuba did not have diplomatic relations at the time. Today, the Cubans and Pakistanis have embassies in each other's capitals. Bruno Rodriguez, the new foreign minister of Cuba, who was then the deputy, headed the mission and lived in Pakistan's rugged mountains for that full year. The Cuban medical teams reportedly worked constructively and positively with personnel from the U.S. and Europe -- and this kind of collaboration, even if informal, could be the kind of confidence-building narrative to move U.S.-Cuba relations out of the gridlock they have been in for decades. As a step in the direction of pushing reset in this relationship, on Friday the White House announced that Cuba will allow US aircraft into its airspace for medical evacuations. The United States could take another step and offer to airlift Cuban doctors to Haiti. Haiti is in trouble today -- the 7.0 earthquake devastating the capital city of Port-au-Prince and highlighting what was already a human development disaster. The UN Development Program's offices have been destroyed, with hundreds unaccounted for. Notwithstanding any casualties among its own citizens in Haiti, Cuba has 408 doctors providing services there. Now is the time for the U.S., Cuba and other major Latin American nations to throw their weight into stopping a worse human tragedy in Haiti than already exists -- and to potentially unite American and Cuban soft power efforts in a way that creates greater positives for Haiti and for longer-term, 21st century U.S.-Cuba relations. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Clemons.","Steve Clemons says Cuba has exported medical help for nations grappling with disasters .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN)  -- Authorities are investigating reports that disabled children in India were buried up to their necks during this week's solar eclipse as a supposed remedy for their handicaps. Hindu women pray as they bathe in the River Ganges after the total solar eclipse in India. Officials said Thursday they were looking into reports that some 34 children aged 2 to 7 were buried in sand up to their chins -- with the consent of the parents -- in the belief that doing so during an eclipse would cure the children of their disabilities. V. Anbu Kumar, caretaker deputy commissioner of Gulbarga district in the state of Karnataka, told CNN that everybody at the site had left when he and police officers arrived. The act was apparently carried out in the early morning hours Wednesday, when the longest solar eclipse of the century turned day into night in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Vietnam, China and parts of the Pacific. Kumar denied that the ritual takes place during every eclipse, but said authorities are ""launching an awareness campaign"" against the practice. A complaint has been registered for ""knowingly endangering human lives,"" Gulbarg police chief B.A. Padmanayna told CNN. Stronger charges could also be pressed against the offenders, he said.

""It may not cause any physical harm to the baby, but it may affect the child's overall personality,"" said R.K. Sharma, who describes himself as a ""remedial astrologer.""

People in New York were faxing it to their friends who worked in the movie business in LA and almost immediately I was getting phone calls from movie producers who wanted to buy it and ABC and HBC wanted to buy it. It started as a seed, with an absolute truth that people may agree with or it may disturb them. It disturbs me sometimes when I read it because it's very wrong and very honest. I think most call it cynicism but I call it realism -- it is absolutely raw reality. It was never written for a big audience and it was never written to make people feel good. It was written as the truth in a humorous way. CNN: How do you feel about the TV series? CB: I think the reason why the TV series has continued, and has continued as a movie, is that they have never lost the authenticity of the column. CNN: How would you describe New York today? CB: It's a very, very busy place and it's a city where everybody has a place to go and a million things to do. It certainly can be a very stressful city but it can also be an incredibly exciting city. It is a place where your dreams can come true. It's also a city where you're going to see sides of human nature that you're going to be shocked by. New York is a city where, if you are open minded, when you walk out of your apartment you don't know what could happen. CNN: What do you do to get away from it? CB: I go to Connecticut and I look at bugs and I don't socialize. If I'm here for 10 days in a row I'm exhausted. When I was younger the energy really fed me. This is a city of energy vampires -- people really feed on each others' energies and that's why New Yorkers talk fast and gesture and they'll come in and say ""Oh my god you won't believe what happened!"" That's a normal greeting in New York. CNN: What was it like to get married and stop being the single girl? CB: Charles [Askegard, a principal dancer with the NYC ballet] and I met at the NYC Spring Gala seven years ago. It was really a magical moment because I was 43 and I had kind of given up on that. I was cynical about relationships and I wasn't sure about marriage -- I was always very worried that marriage was stifling. But when I saw Charles across the room I thought, ""That's the man you're going to marry."" We met and we talked and I thought, ""This is the nicest guy I have ever met in my life,"" and we went to a club and we danced and we kissed. We got married two months after we met. CNN: Can you describe New York in 5 words? CB: It's exciting, passionate, fast paced, straightforward and, strangely enough, it's friendly.","Candace Bushnell is the author of five novels, including Sex and the City .

"(CNN) -- A Texas inmate in a wheelchair, who escaped on foot from two armed guards as he was being transferred between prisons, is now on the U.S. Marshals' list of the 15 most-wanted fugitives. Arcade Comeaux Jr., 49, ""produced a weapon and fired upon two correctional officers, took them hostage and forced them to drive to Baytown, Texas,"" the U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement. He then put the officers in the back of the van and took their weapons and one of their uniforms, the statement said. Comeaux was serving three life sentences for aggravated sexual assault and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He escaped Monday during transport from Huntsville, Texas, to Stiles, Texas. The 6-foot, 200-pound man was shackled and in a wheelchair, ""which he had claimed was needed for mobility,"" Michelle Lyons, director of public information for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Huntsville, said in a statement. About 45 minutes into the trip, as they were driving through Conroe, 40 minutes north of Houston, the prisoner pulled out a pistol and ordered the guards to drive south to Baytown, east of Houston. He fired once, but hit no one during the escape about 9 a.m., officials said. Law enforcement officers found the unharmed officers an hour later. Comeaux was being transferred so he could be near John Sealy Hospital in Galveston for treatment of the supposed paralysis he had suffered during a reported stroke, officials said. At least $16,000 in reward money has been offered for information leading to Comeaux's rearrest and a task force of more than 100 investigators is searching for him, focusing on the Houston area, where he grew up and has family. His escape has led the man who oversees Texas' criminal justice system to call for a shakeup of the prison system. ""I just think enough's enough,"" said Sen. John Whitmire, the Texas Democrat from Houston who is chairman of the state Senate's Criminal Justice Committee. ""We need a complete shakeup of the leadership of our prison system and/or an outside review by third parties,"" he told CNN by phone Wednesday. ""We just can't have security breaches of this nature."" Whitmire said the guards had failed to pat down Comeaux while he was in his wheelchair and before they began the trip. ""Sure enough, he has a firearm,"" he said. ""The question is, are there others (in the prison system)? I think you have to assume that there are until you find out differently."" So far this year, more than 900 cell phones have been confiscated from the 112 locations that house the state's 158,000 prisoners. ""It's pretty rampant,"" he said. ""I want the director to come forward and tell us what it's going to take"" to solve the problem, he said. John Moriarty, inspector general of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said such lapses are highly unusual in the state's penal system. ""We have no open gun investigations other than this one,"" he said. ""The last one was several years ago."" Texas Department of Criminal Justice Executive Director Brad Livingston, who has been in the job since 2005, did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.","Arcade Comeaux Jr. was in wheelchair when he pulled gun on officers .

"Boston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A biology professor charged in the killings of three faculty members at the University of Alabama in Huntsville was initially a suspect in a 1993 attempted mail bombing of a Harvard Medical School professor, The Boston Globe reported Monday. Amy Bishop Anderson and her husband, Jim, were questioned after a package containing two pipe bombs was sent to the Newton, Massachusetts, home of Dr. Paul Rosenberg, a Harvard professor and a doctor at Children's Hospital Boston, the Globe said, citing a law enforcement official. At the time, Anderson was working as a postdoctoral fellow in the hospital's human biochemistry lab. Anderson is charged with capital murder in the Friday shooting deaths, making her eligible for the death penalty in Alabama. Authorities said she was attending a faculty meeting in a university building when she brandished a gun and shot six colleagues, killing three. The mother of four was arrested as she was leaving the building, Huntsville Police Chief Henry Reyes said Saturday. A 9 mm handgun was recovered from the second floor of the building after the shootings Friday. On Saturday, it was revealed that in 1986, Anderson, then 19, shot her brother to death in Braintree, Massachusetts. Authorities determined after an investigation that the shooting was accidental. But Braintree Police Chief Paul Frazier said Saturday, ""It is a far different story, I believe, than what was reported back then. I cannot tell you what the thought process was behind our releasing her at the time."" Anderson's husband, Jim, told CNN on Monday that federal investigators had gathered a dozen subjects in the attempted bombing, but ""there were never any suspects. Never anyone charged, never anyone arrested."" ""Then five years later, we got a letter from the ATF saying, 'You are in the clear,' "" he said, referring to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Sylvia Fluckiger, a lab technician who worked with Anderson at the time, told The Boston Globe on Sunday that Anderson had a dispute with Rosenberg shortly before the bomb incident. Fluckiger told CNN affiliate WCVB-TV in Boston, ""Police interviewed her, and she told me about it. I really wondered if she may have had, you know, some more knowledge, although I'm not accusing her of anything."" Rosenberg was opening a package delivered to his home while he was away on vacation, but he saw wires and a cylinder inside and called police, the Globe reported. ""She was the suspect early on,"" the law enforcement official, who the Globe said had knowledge of the case, told the newspaper of Anderson. She allegedly was concerned that she was going to receive a negative evaluation from Rosenberg, the official said. Jim Anderson told The New York Times the December 1986 death of his wife's brother, Seth, was accidental. He declined to comment when CNN asked him about the shooting Monday. Frazier, however, said Saturday that an official involved in the case and still working for Braintree police told him that the teen had shot her brother during an argument. She fired a shot in her bedroom without hitting anyone, then argued with her brother and shot him, he said. She fled the home after the shooting and was arrested after pointing a weapon at a vehicle near the house in an unsuccessful attempt to get the driver to stop. During the booking process, then-Chief John Polio called and told the officers to release her, Frazier said. He added her mother was then a member of the Braintree Personnel Board. Reached by CNN, Polio, now 87 and retired, denied calling in that order, saying detectives told him the shooting appeared accidental and it was determined Anderson should be released to her mother. He said any link between Anderson's release and her mother's position on the board was ""laughable."" Anderson's mother, Judith, did not answer her door Monday. Reached by telephone, she told CNN, ""We're very distraught,"" and declined further comment. A December 8, 1986, article in The Boston Globe said Anderson asked her mother how to unload a round from a 12-gauge shotgun and accidentally shot her brother while she was handling the weapon. The article cited Polio as the source. The state police report on the incident, released Sunday by the office of Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Massachusetts, is similar to the Globe's account. Delahunt was district attorney at the time; staffers said he was in the Middle East on Sunday and unable to comment on the case. The 1986 report said Braintree police told state police investigators ""indications were that Amy Bishop had been attempting to manipulate the shotgun and had subsequently brought the gun downstairs in an attempt to gain assistance from her mother in disarming the weapon"" when it went off, shooting her brother in the chest. In a December 17, 1986, interview, Anderson told authorities she ""thought it would be a good idea if she learned how to load the shotgun in the house,"" according to the state police report. The young woman told police she was concerned for her own safety after the family home was broken into, although she previously had been afraid of the gun. She said she got the gun and loaded shells into it, but was unable to get them out. Anderson said that while she was attempting to unload the weapon on her bed, it went off. She then took it downstairs to ask for help in unloading it, where the shooting occurred. The police report said both Anderson and her mother said the shooting was accidental. Her mother told police she did not hear the earlier shot in her daughter's bedroom and ""believed the house was relatively well soundproofed and that such a discharge would not necessarily be heard on another floor of the house."" Frazier said police records of the incident are missing. But Polio said, ""There was no cover-up. Absolutely no cover-up and no missing records. The records were all there when I left. Where they went in the last 22 years and two police chiefs subsequent, I don't know."" Braintree Mayor Joseph Sullivan said Sunday that a review will commence to locate all materials associated with the shooting. Anderson, who is known to students as Dr. Bishop, had been working at the University of Alabama in Huntsville since 2003 and was up for tenure, according to spokesman Ray Garner. However, authorities wouldn't discuss possible motives or whether the issue of tenure may have played a role in the shooting. Garner said the university gives teachers six years to get tenure. Those who do not get it are terminated, he said. Jim Anderson told CNN on Monday that his wife had been denied tenure and had appealed that decision and won, but she was still fighting to be granted tenure. She was frustrated with ""the process,"" he said. He told CNN earlier his wife had an attorney but would not say who it was, and he described her as a good teacher. He said Monday his wife wrote three novels, ""medical thrillers."" The couple does not own a gun, he said. He said he last saw his wife briefly on Friday morning before she left for class. He said she was ""loving, got along with everybody."" The family, he said, is devastated, and in ""shock, bewilderment, wondering why."" He told the Times the pipe bomb incident is ""one thing from the past I hoped would not be dredged up.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday. ""The overwhelming amount of scientific studies show that the threat is real,"" she said. The announcement stems from a Supreme Court ruling which ordered the agency to determine the impact of carbon emissions not only on the environment, but on public health. iReport: Share your thoughts on climate change . ""These long-overdue findings cement 2009's place in history as the year when the United States government began addressing the challenge of greenhouse-gas pollution and seizing the opportunity of clean energy reform,"" Jackson said. Immediately after the announcement, Jackson was leaving for Copenhagen, Denmark, to participate in the Copenhagen Climate Conference ahead of President Obama's appearance at the end of the week. Her statement could provide evidence to the conference that the agency and the Obama administration are taking global warming seriously. However, Jackson said that Monday's announcement does not require any immediate regulatory action. The Obama administration is pushing for comprehensive energy legislation from Congress that puts a price on carbon emissions, a so-called ""cap and trade"" policy that uses market forces as an incentive for businesses to reduce carbon emissions. Jackson said carbon dioxide emissions go beyond damaging the environment -- they also endanger public health. The agency made the announcement because it is required to issue an ""endangerment finding"" -- evidence that carbon emissions are dangerous to the public health -- before it can regulate carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases under the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA said in April that it would likely make such a ruling regarding carbon emissions and public health. The agency completed a public-comment process before making the announcement.

"(CNN) -- In Jacmel, Haiti, as light rain fell with the darkness Wednesday, Gwenn Goodale Mangine and a group of 35 people prepared to spend their second night sleeping outside on mattresses and cardboard boxes in her driveway. Everyone is scared to be indoors. It is cold and damp. The people of Jacmel line the streets, setting tires on fire to light up a town that has been reduced to rubble in many parts and is without power, she said. The flames are all that illuminate what remains of this town on the southern coast of Haiti, about 25 miles from the capital Port-au-Prince, Haiti. ""No one is wanting to go back into their homes, so they were all on the street. It's still like that,"" Mangine, 32, told CNN, speaking using a fleeting Internet connection. ""Hundreds of people are all hunkered down for the night passing time and burning tires to light up the night."" The local airport has now become a refugee camp, she said. Buckets have become toilets. Residents shower using containers filled with water, if they can find it, she said. Mangine and other residents of the town, with a population of about 34,000, spent Wednesday trying to stock up on supplies, while they remained fearful of continuing aftershocks, looked for survivors and tried to gauge the level destruction. The U.S. Geological Survey said the perceived shaking from Tuesday's earthquake near Port-au-Prince would have been very strong in Jacmel, and they would be vulnerable to structural damage. ""Schools, homes, churches, businesses, hotels, old historic buildings -- dozens and dozens, gone,"" Mangine told CNN. ""I just kept shaking my head and muttering, 'Oh my word,' over and over."" Mangine and her husband Nick have lived in Jacmel  since April 2009 working with the organization ""Joy in Hope, "" and are houseparents at a home for orphaned children. Today, along with others in this town, they frantically searched for loved ones -- a task made harder by the power outages and Internet troubles in the wake of the devastation. In one incident, a staff member's daughter was nowhere to be found after her home collapsed. They feared the worst, but eventually were elated to find out she was OK. Mangine also helped a 24-year-old man named Hughes find his mother. Mangine and Hughes drove towards Hughes' mother's house. From the truck, he spotted her in the distance. ""He jumps out of the car as I am still driving and he yells, 'Manman, Manman!' [Mommy, mommy],"" Mangine said. ""He runs and hugs her and starts sobbing. His mother, Rosemary, is clinging to him, and sobbing too."" They embraced tightly for more than five minutes, Mangine said. ""Man, it tore my heart out,"" she said. ""I couldn't help but sob myself."" Mangine said she has lived through tropical storms and floods that caused landslides and problems -- problems she attributes to poor construction. Haiti was 'catastrophe waiting to happen' At the Hands and Feet Project in Jacmel, Mark Stuart said he believes good construction is what kept their structure largely intact. ""I'm very, very thankful for the quality of the construction here,"" Stuart said. ""It gives us a hope that we will make it."" Hope is alive in Jacmel, Mangine said, but the earthquake caused destruction she couldn't believe. ""This is a whole different scale,"" she said. ""It's the most helpless feeling in the world. We've just heard story after story of people being trapped in piles of rubble -- and there's no way to dig them out. No big machinery. No tools. There's nothing. Nothing."" It lies in stark contrast of what it was more than a day ago. Before the quake hit, she had just finished English and Creole lessons with a staff member and went to lie down. When the tremors began, she initially dismissed it as a large truck going by. ""But then I realized the house was really shaking. The whole house,"" she said. ""Things began to fall off the wall. The thought going through my head was that our house was collapsing."" Her heart began pounding, she said. ""I was pretty sure I wasn't going to get out in time since I was on the second floor,"" she said. ""I jumped up quickly and started screaming in English and in Creole for my children to leave the house."" They counted their blessings when they realized everyone they knew was okay. Now, Mangine and her group are trying to focus on helping wherever they can. The city is devastated. ""[It] looks like Jacmel, just more broken. Jacmel was once a beautiful, thriving city. That's long since passed,"" she said. ""[But] what happened yesterday tore up a big chunk of history, a big chunk of commerce, and a big chunk of the hearts of the Haitian people."" Still, as she prepared to sleep outside again with her family, staff and others in the town, Mangine saw a silver lining. ""I still feel optimistic that if anyone can rise above this, it is the people of Haiti,"" she said. ""There's a Creole word for when you have to rig something to make do -- degaje. In my opinion the ability to degaje is in part what gives this culture the spirit of resiliency that I so admire."" CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Residents in Jacmel, Haiti, sleeping on mattresses, boxes in driveways .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods announced that he is taking ""an indefinite break"" from professional golf, according to a statement posted on his Web site Friday. ""I am deeply aware of the disappointment and hurt that my infidelity has caused to so many people, most of all my wife and children,"" the statement says. ""I want to say again to everyone that I am profoundly sorry and that I ask forgiveness. It may not be possible to repair the damage I've done, but I want to do my best to try."" The 33-year-old golfer, who tops the sport's world rankings, has been mired in controversy since he crashed his car outside his Florida mansion late last month. The crash prompted authorities to cite him for careless driving and fine him $164. Woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck, and declined to talk with investigators on several occasions. In the week following the crash, Woods apologized for ""transgressions"" that let his family down, on the same day that gossip magazine US Weekly published a report alleging that Woods, who is married to Elin Nordegren, had an affair with a 24-year-old cocktail waitress named Jaimee Grubbs. US Weekly's report followed a National Enquirer article before the crash that the athlete was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess -- an assertion the hostess vigorously denied, according to The New York Post. See the statement on Woods' Web site . It was not immediately clear how Woods' hiatus would affect his sponsorships, though Nike, his main sponsor, issued a statement saying Woods ""and his family have Nike's full support."" ""He is the best golfer in the world and one of the greatest athletes of his era,"" Nike spokeswoman Beth Gast said in the statement. ""We look forward to his return to golf."" The statement did not elaborate on whether Woods' announcement would impact his business relationship with the sports equipment and clothing company, which has worked with him for more than a decade. Woods' other sponsors include Gillette, Gatorade and Electronic Arts. The Professional Golfers' Association Tour said it supports Woods and looks forward to his return to the game. ""We fully support Tiger's decision to step away from competitive golf to focus on his family. His priorities are where they need to be, and we will continue to respect and honor his family's request for privacy,"" the PGA Tour said in a statement Friday.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- With every click of his camera, Japanese photographer and activist Shuuichi Endou hopes to draw attention to the plight of Tuvalu, a remote nation of people whose home is slowly disappearing. Tuvalu is the world's fourth smallest country behind Vatican City, Monaco and Pacific Ocean neighbor Nauru. He's taking 10,000 photos, one of each person who lives there, to show the world the human face of climate change. ""Tuvaluans do not ask much, neither goods nor money,"" he says. ""In Japan, people sacrifice their time and life to get more goods and money. I hope the viewers see the contrast by looking at the photos. We're sacrificing peaceful Tuvalu."" At first glance, Tuvalu is an island paradise, 26 square kilometers of white sand and lush foliage in the Pacific Ocean, north of Fiji. But the sea level is rising, so much so that the nation's water has become too salty to drink and to grow vegetables, especially taro, a vegetable that was once the island's staple food. ""As they don't have water and food, they began to import food from overseas, says Endou, who set up the NGO Tuvalu Overview to highlight their cause. ""As they began to import, their consumption has been increasing. As a result, more and more products began to be imported. This changed Tuvaluans' diet and increased the amount of waste."" A global appeal . Tuvalu's government considers the situation so urgent it has allocated some of the nation's meager budget to pay for its own permanent ambassador to the United Nations in New York. Afelee Pita took up the job in December 2006 and within months had given perhaps the most important speech ever made by a Tuvaluan: an address to a Special Session of the United Nations Security Council on Energy, Climate and Security. ""That was my very first statement that I issued and it was also a challenging one because it had never been done before, particularly at that level at the Security Council,"" Pita says. He told the assembled dignitaries: ""The world has moved from a global threat once called the Cold War, to what now should be considered the 'Warming War'. Our conflict is not with guns and missiles but with weapons from everyday lives -- chimney stacks and exhaust pipes."" click here for the full speech . New York is a long way from home for the native Tuvaluan. Back on the island he'd be more likely to go for an early morning canoe ride than negotiate thousands of commuters on the subway. ""Living in New York is totally different compared to where we come from. Life is not that easy of course. You have so many strangers. At home, you know everybody [and] whatever you do everybody knows,"" he laughs. Securing a future . While he'd much rather be at home -- ""Definitely there's nothing like home"" -- Pita feels that his time in New York is vital in helping to secure the future of the islands. ""My ultimate objective is to contribute as much as I can in terms of trying to establish relations with as many member states in the UN as possible, and more importantly to secure some sort of commitment from the international community in terms of development projects and any kind of assistance they can provide to us."" The Tuvalu nation wants to invest in renewable energy projects, to reduce the island's own reliance on fossil fuels for energy. ""Sometimes you have to clean your own house first before you look outside,"" Pita says. In English, Tuvalu means ""eight standing together"". On the issue of climate change, Tuvalu hopes the world will stand together with them. ""To me it's not an easy issue to solve, particularly in terms of trying to get the commitment of rich countries,"" Pita says. ""I can, of course, understand their reasoning and how they look at the issue but I think what we need to do is to continue raising our concerns and hopefully one day the community will listen and try to commit something.""","Pacific nation Tuvalu feeling the effects of climate change, sea level rising fast .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- A Spaniard has died from the human form of mad cow disease, the fifth such death in Spain since 2005, the Ministry of Health said in a statement late Friday. The victim died in January in the northern city of Santander, according to the statement, which did not provide further details. The victim was a woman who was hospitalized last fall, according to Juan Jose Badiola, director of Spain's national research center for mad cow disease. The ministry reiterated that there is no danger from eating meat in Spain. ""The appearance of these sporadic cases is within the predictions that were made at the European level more than nine years ago,"" the ministry statement said. Ten years can pass between eating contaminated tissue and the appearance of the human form of the disease also called variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, health officials say. The steps to avoid the disease, taken after the first cases of mad cow disease appeared in the United Kingdom, include isolating infected animals and prohibiting cattle feed of animal origin or with animal proteins, the ministry said. Three of Spain's five deaths from the disease were in the northern province of Leon. The city of Santander is in the nearby Cantabria province. Last September, officials reported the death of a woman from the human form of mad cow disease. Officials also said her son had died earlier from the same disease. It was believed to have been the first case in the world where two members of the same family have died from the disease, Badiola told CNN at the time. The mother, in her early 60s, died in August 2008. Her son, 41, died in February 2008, Badiola said. Badiola said it was the mother and son likely contracted the disease before stricter controls against mad cow disease began in Spain in 2001. The mother and son had similar eating habits, Badiola said, which included eating animal organs, such as kidneys and livers, and they may also have eaten animal brains. The mother and son were from a village in Leon province. The third fatality in that province was a woman, 50, a local government worker, who died in December 2007. The first confirmed death from mad cow disease in Spain was in 2005, when a young woman died near Madrid.","Spain's Ministry of Health reports fifth death from mad cow disease .

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- A new type of walk-through security machine will debut at several U.S. airports in the coming days as the Transportation Security Administration tries out the latest in body scanning technology. Privacy experts with the ACLU are concerned the walk-through scanning machine is too invasive. It's called ""millimeter-wave passenger imaging technology,"" and it produces a more detailed picture than the metal detectors in use now at airports to screen for weapons and explosives.. Because it produces such a detailed image, however, technology and privacy experts at the American Civil Liberties Union are not satisfied that the new technology meets privacy standards. In a written statement issued Thursday, Barry Steinhardt of the ACLU said the technology can pick up graphic body images and even medical details like whether a passenger has a colostomy bag. Steinhardt called the screening an ""assault on the essential dignity of passengers that citizens in a free nation should not have to tolerate."" TSA spokeswoman Elle Howe said privacy will be respected with the new millimeter-wave technique. ""We want to preserve passengers' privacy and make them feel comfortable with trying a technology like this,"" she said. A TSA officer will escort a passenger to the machine for the test, but the person looking at the actual body scans will be at a different location and will not see the passenger, the TSA said. In addition, the scans will have a ""modesty filter"" to blur out faces, and no images will be saved. But the ACLU expressed concern that TSA officers would not be able to resist the temptation to save images of certain people, such as celebrities, and that the plan to blur faces might later be changed. This is how the new scanners work. The passenger steps into a machine where he or she is quickly scanned with radio waves. Those waves reflect off the body to transmit a three-dimensional image of the passenger that looks like a fuzzy photo negative. A TSA officer studies the image on a screen and looks for unusual shapes that might mean a passenger is carrying something suspicious. Passengers who are asked to undergo a second screening can choose a pat-down search or the millimeter-wave test. The TSA says the machines scan a passenger twice, each scan taking less than two seconds. But it takes another minute or two for a screener to review the scans before signaling a passenger to move on. The TSA demonstrated the screening technology at a news conference Wednesday near Washington. Howe said the millimeter wave is harmless and ""can see more than a magnetometer,"" which is the first screening machine airport passengers encounter. ""A magnetometer only picks up metal or weapons, so this could see other materials that might be hidden on the body and it also produces an image"" rather than just a beep, she said. Asked if the millimeter wave could detect an object hidden in a body cavity, she said only that the TSA will learn more about the technology as it's tested at U.S. airports. The TSA has been testing another type of imaging technology called backscatter. This technology also came under some fire because it shows very detailed body images -- which led some critics to call it an electronic strip search. So, the backscatter was altered and blurred to show more of an outline of the body. The TSA will continue to test the backscatter scanners in some airports. TSA officials said they are a long way from deciding whether they'll settle on just one of these imaging technologies. Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, Arizona, begins using the new machines Thursday -- to be offered as an option for people who are asked to be screened a second time. Los Angeles International Airport in California and John Fitzgerald Kennedy International Airport in New York are also slated to try the machines . Britain, Spain, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Thailand and the Netherlands are using the millimeter wave screening. In the United States, some courthouses and jails are trying it.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Slashing red tape or ignoring ordinarily required paperwork, officials in the United States and the Netherlands have cleared the way for scores of Haitian orphans to leave their earthquake-ravaged homeland, according to officials from the two countries. All of the children had adoptions pending with prospective parents in the two countries before Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake, and government officials said paperwork was expedited or put on hold to make transfers happen on an emergency basis. 300 children have pending adoption cases with American families. Six children arrived in Florida Sunday night, met by their adoptive parents with hugs and tears of happiness. The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs has chartered a plane to pick up about 100 children Monday, spokesman Aad Meijer told CNN. Dutch Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin over the weekend granted the children entry into the country, although their paperwork, including travel and adoption documents, was incomplete, Justice Ministry spokesman Patrick Mikkelsen told CNN. About 44 of the orphans' adoptions had yet to be approved by a Haitian judge, even though they were matched to Dutch parents, Mikkelsen said. Dutch officials may seek the remaining approvals from Haiti once the children have already settled in the Netherlands, he added. Haiti is home to about 380,000 orphans, according to the United Nations Children's Fund, and that number is expected to grow in the wake of Tuesday's earthquake. And those who lived in orphanages before Tuesday may be homeless now, as reports of destroyed orphanages have come throughout the quake zone. Full coverage of the earthquake in Haiti . Some children who lost parents in the quake or were separated from parents are being relocated to the Dominican Republic, a child advocacy group said. About 50 orphaned and abandoned children will arrive in the border town of Jimani on Wednesday, Kids Alive International said. The efforts, coordinated with the governments of both countries, will eventually take the children back to Haiti. Some will be reunited with parents who lost communication with their children in the quake's aftermath, the group said. View or add to CNN's database of missing persons in Haiti .

"(CNN) -- Tensions between Israel and Turkey spilled into a second day Tuesday when Turkish officials summoned the Israeli ambassador to a meeting, Turkey's Anatolia news agency reported. Israel criticized Turkey Monday for a Turkish television series that it said depicted Israeli intelligence agents as baby-snatchers. When asked about Tuesday's meeting between Israeli Ambassador Gabby Levy and Turkish officials, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said it was pre-planned. That session came one day after Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon summoned the Turkish ambassador to complain about the television show that Israel found offensive, a spokesman for Ayalon said. Afterward, Ayalon tweeted that he had ""Told Turk Amb that this is an intolerable situation which endangers the Jewish community, the Israel envoys and tourists coming to Turkey."" Several senior Israeli Foreign Ministry sources, who didn't want to be named because it would jeopardize their jobs, criticized Ayalon's treatment of Turkish Ambassador Ahmet Oguz Celikkol at the start of their meeting Monday. At the session, Celikkol was seated below Ayalon. With cameras rolling, Ayalon turned to the television crews and said, ""The main thing is that you see that he is seated low and that we are high ... that there is one flag on the table (the Israeli flag) and that we are not smiling."" The sources told CNN they were ""surprised by Ayalon's undiplomatic behavior."" Ceylon Ozen, spokeswoman for the Turkish Embassy in Tel Aviv, told CNN that Celikkol felt his treatment was ""unacceptable, shocking and primitive,"" and did not comply with standards for diplomacy. He has contacted the Israeli ambassador to Turkey and requested a formal apology from the Israelis, she said. There had been media speculation that Ayalon's summons was designed to sabotage a trip to Ankara Sunday by Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak. A spokesman for Ayalon said that was ""completely wide of the mark."" Barak's office said he had no plans to cancel his trip. Israeli politicians and media outlets roundly condemned an episode of the popular Turkish soap opera, ""Valley of the Wolves: Ambush,"" that depicted the Israeli intelligence service Mossad spying inside Turkey and kidnapping Turkish babies. The program also showed Mossad attacking the Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv and taking the ambassador and his family hostage. In a written statement, ""Valley of the Wolves: Ambush"" producer Pana Film said the show ""will continue to tell the truth and expose the wrongs."" Israel summoned the Turkish ambassador the same day that Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan lambasted Israel for air strikes Sunday on Gaza, the Turkish state-run Anatolian News Agency reported. ""Why is it doing this? Because it says 'I possess the power in this region,'"" the news agency quoted Erdogan as saying of Israel. ""It possesses unproportionate power and it is using this. It is not acting in accordance with U.N. resolutions, it is uncomfortable. It says 'I will do whatever I please.'"" During a joint news conference, held with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Erdogan called for the international community ""to warn Israel about its nuclear arsenal just like it did with Iran,"" ANA reported. Israel is widely believed to have a nuclear arsenal, but has never acknowledged that publicly. In a written statement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry condemned the criticism. ""Erdogan's remarks join the anti-Israel program broadcast on Turkish television and the harsh statements against Israel that have been said consistently and systematically for over a year,"" the statement said. ""The state of Israel reserves the full right to protect its citizens from missile attacks and from the terror of the Hamas and Hezbollah. Turkey is the last that can preach morality to Israel and the IDF (Israel Defense Forces)."" ""Valley of the Wolves: Ambush"" is part of a popular franchise in Turkey. The series ""Valley of the Wolves"" first aired in 2003 on Turkish television, followed by a 2006 movie of the same name that stirred controversy with its portrayal of American soldiers in Iraq and what some described as thinly-veiled anti-Semitism. The movie, based on the series, featured American actors Gary Busey and Billy Zane. Another television version, ""Valley of the Wolves: Terror,"" was canceled after one episode in February 2007. ""Ambush"" first aired in April 2007. Israel and Turkey have enjoyed close military and economic ties for more than a decade. But relations have grown testy at times in recent years over Israel's activities in the Palestinian territories and over its Gaza offensive in December and January.

"Srinigar, Indian-administered Kashmir (CNN) -- Indian authorities flooded the streets of Srinagar with security forces Thursday to quell four days of violence sparked by the death of a schoolboy. Authorities were attempting to disperse anti-India protesters Sunday when a tear gas shell hit the 13-year-old boy, Whamiq Farooq Wani, in the head and killed him as he played cricket in a stadium, protesters say. While a formal curfew has not been declared, security forces have been keeping people off the streets. Police said having security forces deployed has kept down violence over the last four days. A senior police officer said more than 100 people, including members of the Indian security forces, were wounded in the violent clashes between the Muslim protesters and security forces -- who used tear gas and baton charges to disperse the mobs. Two young protesters were hit by tear gas and smoke shells in Wednesday's violence in the old city, and hospital sources said their conditions are serious. Clashes and incidents of stone-throwing by anti-India protesters continued to be reported from various points in Kashmir Thursday. Srinagar, the capital city, remained shut along with other towns in protest of the teenaged boy's death. Shops, businesses and government offices were closed. Indian police and paramilitary troops, as well as the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), erected barricades at road intersections in Srinagar's old city to cut off pedestrian and vehicular traffic, witnesses said. ""The people were not allowed to go out of their homes to buy milk and other essential items this morning. The security forces are enforcing tight restrictions in our area,"" said resident Ayub Zargarc reached by telephone. The security restrictions were not as stringent outside the old city, where some vehicular and pedestrian movement was seen on the streets patrolled by the Indian police. ""Barring a few stone-pelting incidents, the overall situation in Kashmir remained peaceful today,"" Farooq Ahmad, inspector general of police in the Kashmir zone, told CNN. Authorities arrested two senior leaders of the pro-dialogue moderate separatist conglomerate All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) and placed its chairman, Mirwaiz Moulvi Umar Farooq, under house arrest today, according to police. Authorities said they were arrested to prevent them from fomenting trouble in the city.","Indian security forces in Srinagar to quell violence sparked by death of schoolboy .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A letter penned by George Washington praising the new Constitution sold for $3.2 million at an auction, the highest price for a letter by America's first president. The four-page letter in Washington's slanting penmanship was written to his nephew Bushrod Washington in November 1787, according to Christie's, the company that auctioned it. It was in the possession of an unidentified British descendant of his family, Christie's said. Washington led the Philadelphia Convention, at which the Constitution was drafted in 1787. After the Constitution was produced, a nationwide debate ensued on whether to ratify it. In the letter written from Washington's Virginia estate, Mount Vernon, he endorses the Constitution and highlights the benefits of compromise and of states merging into one nation. ""The central issues must be consolidated -- and local views as far as the general good will admit, must be attended to,"" he says in the letter, according to Christie's. The company said the president confided in his nephew. ""Washington professed neutrality in public, but to Bushrod expressed his unequivocal conviction that the new Constitution must be ratified, in spite of opposition from many special-interest groups,"" Christie's said. The buyer was not identified. Christie's had earlier estimated that the letter would fetch $1.5 million to $2.5 million at Friday's auction. Washington served from 1789 to 1797, then died of a throat infection two years later. He died at his beloved Mount Vernon at age 67, plunging the nation into months of mourning. Last year, a 1864 letter in which President Abraham Lincoln replies to the abolitionist pleas of youth sold for $3.4 million.","Highest price ever paid for a letter penned by America's first president .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish, Iraqi and Syrian ministers met in Ankara on Thursday to discuss water shortages in the major Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which run through all three countries. Iraqi fishermen ride their motor boat in the waters of the Tigris River in Baghdad. The meeting comes amid a diplomatic spat over Iraqi accusations that Syria is harboring terrorists. The Tigris River has plunged to record low levels, Iraqi farmers told CNN. Iraq is suffering a drought that its officials are calling a ""catastrophe."" Baghdad and Damascus want Turkey, where the source of the Tigris and Euphrates is located, to increase the flow of water passing through its network of dams. ""Syria and Iraq are badly in need of water but our Iraqi brothers feel the need much more ... it is why this meeting is so important,"" Turkey's official Anatolian Agency quoted Syrian Irrigation Minister Nader al-Bounni as saying at the start of Thursday's tri-partite meeting to address water resources. ""Our dams are empty and we have human needs."" Also attending the meeting was Iraq's Water and Natural Resources and Turkey's Environment and Forestry minister, as well as its Energy minister . But at the start of the meeting at a hotel in the Turkish capital, Turkey's energy minister seemed to rule out delivering significant quantities of additional water to Iraq and Syria. ""We are aware of the water needs of Syria and Iraq,"" Energy Minister Taner Yildiz told journalists at the entrance to the conference. ""Water is not plenty in Turkey, and therefore we cannot exceed the determined amount too much."" Turkey provided Syria and Iraq 500 cubic meters of water a second, Yildiz said. But, he added, central and eastern Turkey had only received 350 cubic meters/second of water this year. The Turkish government said rainfall over its part of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers plummeted by about 46 percent in the past three years. Over the past decade, some environmental and political analysts have written about the scenario of a ""water war"" possibly breaking out in the Middle East as countries affected by climate change compete over dwindling access to fresh water. However, there are more immediate political tensions complicating relations between the neighboring countries. Syria and Iraq have withdrawn their ambassadors from each others' capitals after a series of deadly suicide truck bombings in Baghdad killed more than 100 people last month. Iraq demanded Syria hand over several suspects it accuses of organizing the attacks. Damascus has denied charges that it is harboring insurgents. This week, Turkey's foreign minister shuttled between Baghdad and Damascus, carrying messages between the two capitals in an effort to defuse tensions.","Tigris River has plunged to record low levels, Iraqi farmers say .

"CHEGUTU, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Farmers are implicating a close ally of President Robert Mugabe's in the latest round of farm seizures in Zimbabwe in which Mugabe loyalists take over white-owned farms. Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, left, and President Robert Mugabe have a power-sharing agreement. The accusations against Senate President Edna Madzongwe came as Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara on Friday toured farms that Mugabe followers had taken over. On many of those farms, production has fallen under the new owners. Mutambara is heading a government commission investigating the farm seizures. ""Black people who acquired farms must produce,"" he said. Mutambara said the government is taking the matter seriously. ""There will be no holy cows; the ax will fall where it may,"" he added. ""We will not tolerate any government official who is promoting lawlessness in our country."" Reports of violence on white-owned farms have increased since a power-sharing government in February between Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. One death was reported Sunday on the Stockdale Farm in Chegutu, 75 miles (about 120 kilometers) southwest of Zimbabwe's capital, Harare. Peter Etheridge, who previously owned that farm, said Madzongwe had illegally claimed his property. But the daughter of the Senate president denied the allegation. ""We got this farm legally. In fact, they [Etheridge] opened the gates for us, and we moved in,"" said Farai Madzongwe, adding that her mother is ""a law-abiding citizen."" She said she wouldn't comment on the violence and the reported death, saying, ""That is for police and courts."" Local media reported the Senate president has four farms. Etheridge denied he had handed over Stockdale Farm, saying that Edna Madzongwe pushed him out. ""They forced us out, and production on farms has stopped since last month,"" he said. ""This madness has to stop since the country needs food and foreign currency."" The Stockdale Farm was among those the government commission visited Friday. When journalists approached the farm before government officials arrived, a police officer on the property cocked his gun to scare them off. The journalists refused to leave, and the police officer called Farai Madzongwe to report them as intruders. Etheridge criticized the police presence at his former farm. ""They are giving protection to her but not us who want to feed the nation,"" he said. At other farms, militia armed with guns tried unsuccessfully to prevent the government delegation from entering.","Zimbabwe Senate president -- a Robert Mugabe ally -- accused of farm seizure .

"(CNN) -- Jacques Bazin didn't have time to catch his breath after being pulled from the rubble of a three-bedroom home on the outskirts of the Haitian capital. Though he'd been trapped in the house for three days, he marshaled the strength to begin helping the Haitians who had just rescued him search for other survivors. He spoke to CNN on Friday, two hours after being rescued, and again Saturday as he worked to free 10 children still encased in the toppled residence. ""Next time you call, God willing, they might be out. Otherwise, they will die,"" he said. ""Their voices are really low because for four days, they eat nothing. I drill holes on top of the cement and put bread inside so they can eat. What we do, we have to do fast."" Friday evening made his mission more urgent as two children were killed when an aftershock -- one of four that day, all 4.6 magnitude or higher -- disrupted the concrete slabs imprisoning them, he said. A New York-based philanthropist, Bazin, 54, has been in Haiti since December 13. His nonprofit organization, JB Humanitarian, builds schools for the poor in Haiti. Six staff members of one of his schools, in Ocadet, died when the 7.0-magnitude quake struck Tuesday, causing the school to collapse on top of them. Bazin was on the porch of a nearby home taking pictures of the mountains. Twenty-four children were inside the home, he said. ""The next thing I know, this thing is splitting in half -- the mountain split in half,"" he said. ""The house where I was went down."" He and 12 of the children had been freed as of Saturday morning, but the remaining children were in the back of the house when the earthquake hit. Bazin said he and 11 others were working to free them in one of the poorest sections of Port-au-Prince. Looking for a loved one? Visit iReport.com . Bazin's dilemma was one of myriad stories of lost loved ones pouring into CNN this week via its tip lines and iReport.com. Other pleas for help have reportedly come from within the rubble of collapsed buildings. Regine Madhere is one such case. The 26-year-old worked in the pharmacy of a four-story Caribbean market leveled by the temblor. Stateside friends and relatives in Port-au-Prince told CNN that Madhere had been sending texts to relatives and to a local radio station this week. Reached Saturday in Port-au-Prince, Madhere's aunt and uncle said an American rescue team had been working through the night to rescue those trapped in the market's ruins. Watch a rescue at the market from earlier in the week . Her uncle, Guy Gelin, further said he had seen the rescuers free six to eight people Friday and he was hopeful that Madhere would be free by day's end. ""They are working very, very hard. They make many holes so [those trapped] can breathe. They give us hope today,"" said her aunt, Ginette Madhere, who hasn't slept since the quake rocked the capital. Help the Madhere family find Regine . With a dearth of resources and rescuers in Haiti, victims are reaching out to locales as faraway as Florida, New York, even Germany. The long-distance text messages serve as a sign of the fear and desperation many are experiencing in the Western Hemisphere's most-impoverished nation. Bazin said his own anguish is confounded by doubts that rescuers will reach his school in Ocadet anytime soon. ""Nobody give a damn because these people are so poor,"" he said. ""This is the last place they would ever think of coming."" He planned to head into the city later Saturday, he said, to find more food for the trapped children. He said he also hoped to rent a tractor to move some of the larger chunks of concrete enveloping the students. ""I have to get them out before I get back to the States. I cannot just leave them like that,"" he said.","Jacques Bazin says two children died under a collapsed house after a Friday aftershock .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Watching and playing golf is par for the course for most fans of the game -- but how about owning a piece of the sport's history? Golf memorabilia is very collectable and clubs in mint condition can go for a lot of money at auction. A Chinese businessman recently splashed out almost $200,000 on the largest collection of hickory golf clubs ever made. But golf memorabilia is not just the preserve of the very wealthy. Bonhams Auctioneers in Chester, England will auction off golf items which appeal to fans with large and small budgets at an auction in the city on July 25. Do you collect golf memorabilia? What kind of items are interested in? Add your comments in the Sound Off box below. Kevin McGimpsey, who is an expert in golfing memorabilia at Bonhams, admitted a number of fans remain keen to invest in items despite the current economic climate. ""There is still a healthy appetite for golf memorabilia at auction, the most popular items tend to be programs -- those from the majors and also the Ryder Cup are particularly collectable and ones from the 1930s and 1940s can fetch upwards of $800. ""In terms of the more modern stuff -- anything Tiger Woods-related tends to sell well and items which aren't necessarily available to the general public tend to be very collectable. ""For example a signed menu from a Ryder Cup dinner would fetch a good price. ""Sometimes the most valuable items can be found tucked away in an uncle's attic or shed and not discovered for years. Check out the golfing memorabilia gallery for some of the items up for auction. » . ""And as for the most valuable piece of memorabilia it is probably a spur iron club which was used in the 1600s. The last time one of these came up for auction it went for $350,000 -- although it would probably be nearer to $500,000 today,"" McGimpsey added. The record price for a club sold in Britain was $170,000 paid in 1998 at Christie's for a metal-headed, blade putter. A figure that eclipsed the amount an early 18th-century Scottish club raised when it went under the hammer for $150,000 at Sotheby's annual golfing memorabilia auction held in Musselburgh near Edinburgh. It is no coincidence that items from the history of the sport litter auction houses around the world, as the sport has many wealthy collectors and centuries of play from which to quarry objects. King James II of Scotland documented the first official record of golf in 1457 when he banned the game because it had proved distracting to his soldiers who played the game as an alternative to archery practice. The earliest set of woods and irons are thought to date from the early 1600s, though it has proved hard to accurately date the equipment thus far.","Golf memorabilia remains popular with fans despite tough economic times .

"Marietta, Georgia (CNN) -- In this tough economy, a steady paycheck is a big blessing. With the unemployment rate above 10 percent, Americans are finding new ways to help each other out. For many, it's through their faith. ""We did say our prayers,"" Patricia Mulroney said. ""I pray to St. Joseph even now. He is our patron of workers. I still pray to him every day."" Yet believers like Mulroney are doing more than praying. They're getting help in their job searches from houses of worship. And religious institutions are answering the call: Houses of worship nationwide have offered job-finding help. Mulroney has looked for help in finding a job through a network created at St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Marietta, Georgia, just outside Atlanta. The church has reviewed résumés and arranged meetings between job-seekers and company representatives. It also has hosted speakers who have discussed financial planning and interview techniques. Similar programs have received attention in places such as Arizona, California and Michigan. St. Joseph's started helping unemployed members last year after a priest contacted Art Eyzaguierre, a parishioner with a background in career management. Eyzaguierre says the priest told him, ""we've been getting a lot of phone calls from people that are unemployed and really hurting ... and we'd like you to come to a council meeting to talk about what we should do."" By May of last year, St. Joseph's Career Community Network was born. ""When you're helping people ... they're getting what they need,"" Eyzaguierre said. ""They're getting jobs, the hope they need. ... I feel replenished."" Patrick Brennan, another founding member, found himself out of work in the early part of 2009. His involvement with the Career Community Network paid off, literally, with a job. ""It's through these different networking opportunities ... through your churches ... you get to meet people ... and potentially get positions,"" Brennan said. ""That happened to me, where I was networking and actually found a position ... as a result of meeting people through the career network."" Brennan says church-based career networks like his reach out in both a spiritual and practical sense for the unemployed, the under-employed and those seeking to re-enter the work force. ""We offer review of résumés ... the opportunity to meet with department leaders or heads of companies ... discuss with them where individual career goals can go,"" he said. ""We also have featured speakers who help with financial planning, retirement funds, health benefits and also interviewing techniques ... looking at different market shares."" Caroline Rittenhouse helps organize biweekly sessions. When she signed on, Rittenhouse was a stay-at-home mom looking to re-enter the work force. She's now employed and using her job skills in training and instructional design to help others find work. ""My motivation was seeing how tough the job market was and how many people across every industry, every income level, were feeling the job loss and the unemployment situation,"" Rittenhouse said. She says networking opportunities, like those offered through St. Joseph's Career Community Network, are key, and houses of worship may offer a more comfortable environment. ""There is something about going to a church,"" Rittenhouse said. ""Personally, I feel like it's more welcoming."" Americans overwhelmingly support government funding for religious groups to provide social services like job training. Nearly nine years after former President George W. Bush unveiled his faith-based initiative, 69 percent of Americans say they favor the idea, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. Sixty-eight percent believe that people providing the services through houses of worship would be more caring and compassionate. Mulroney not only supports the idea, she got involved a few months ago at St. Joseph's as both a volunteer and a job seeker. ""My last position, I was in for seven years and not really comfortable with networking, so I thought the church would be a great place to start ... and get contacts to possibly help me find employment,"" Mulroney said. Since then, Mulroney has moved to Florida. She says she's taking the hope, faith and job skills St. Joseph's Career Community Network provided and will probably join another job networking group at a local church, in her ongoing search for a steady paycheck.","More unemployed are getting help in job searches from houses of worship .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A 92-year-old woman with cocaine strapped to her body flew all the way from Brazil to Spain before police arrested her, in a wheelchair, at Madrid's airport. A Civil Guard spokeswoman says the 92-year old was apprehended at Madrid's Barajas Airport. They found 4.3 kilos, or nearly 9.5 pounds, of cocaine packets strapped to her legs and torso, and also arrested a 44-year-old female companion, who tried to escape on another plane, a Civil Guard spokeswoman told CNN Tuesday. The two women, both from Uruguay, were arrested Friday after arriving in Madrid on a flight from Sao Paolo, Brazil. But officials did not release details about the case until this week, after a judge had arraigned the two on drug trafficking charges. The judge ordered the younger woman to prison but sent the 92-year-old to a senior citizens' home in Madrid. Due to her advanced age, ""it's practically impossible"" that she would be tried or face jail time, said the Civil Guard spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified. Police did not identify the two women. Civil Guards became suspicious when the younger woman repeatedly told the older woman -- who had asked for an airport wheelchair in Madrid to traverse the terminal -- that if they rushed, they would make their connecting flight to Spain's Canary Islands. The Civil Guards, who run customs controls at the airport, stopped the woman in the wheelchair. The younger woman immediately fled, first trying to make the connecting flight, which by then had closed its doors, and then attempting to leave the airport terminal for the street. But she was stuck in the ""satellite,"" or second building, of Terminal 4, which is connected to the main building and the street by an underground train. Police caught up with her before she left the satellite terminal. The two would-be smugglers probably expected a cash payment and return flight tickets to Brazil from their drug trafficking contacts, the Civil Guard spokeswoman said.","Two women, both from Uruguay, arrested after arriving in Madrid on flight from Brazil .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- The head of the German army has resigned after a news report that he knew civilians could be killed in a September airstrike in Afghanistan, Germany's defense minister told Parliament Thursday. Gen. Wolfgang Schneiderhan, the army's chief of staff, asked to be relieved of his duties following the report in Germany's Bild newspaper, said German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. The Sept. 4 NATO airstrike in the northern province of Kunduz killed at least 90 people. The German commander in the area called in the strike after Afghans tried to siphon fuel from two tankers hijacked by the Taliban a day earlier. The fuel had been earmarked for NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Local Afghan officials said at least half of those killed were civilians, and NATO acknowledged soon afterward that civilians had been killed. NATO and Afghan officials launched an investigation, the results of which are still classified, ISAF told CNN Thursday. Bild, which said it had access to confidential documents and posted a video of the airstrike on its Web site, reported that German Colonel Georg Klein was not able to rule out the possibility of civilian victims before he ordered the strike. Bild said a report dated September 6 -- two days after the strike -- made clear that it was impossible for Klein to verify information his informant had provided before he called in the airstrike. CNN's Diana Magnay contributed to this report.","General Wolfgang Schneiderhahn asks to be relieved of his duties .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- An anti-whaling activist jumped aboard a Japanese security ship on Monday in a bid to make a citizen's arrest of its skipper over the sinking of their boat, an animal rights group said. Pete Bethune was captain of the ""Ady Gill"" boat, which sank after a Japanese whaler rammed into it in January, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which owned the boat, said on its Web site. The New Zealander climbed aboard the Japanese ship ""Shonan Maru 2"" in the middle of the night from a jet ski to arrest its skipper, the animal rights group said. ""His first attempt failed when he fell into the frigid waters,"" the group said. ""But despite this, the crew of the 'Shonan Maru 2' failed to see him and he successfully boarded the whaler without detection."" After the incident, Bethune complained of a minor injury to his thumb, according to Japan's ministry of fisheries. The 20 crew members of the Japanese ship were not harmed and their vessel was not damaged, the ministry said. Japanese authorities called the incident the latest ""publicity stunt"" from the animal rights group and said they have not decided what to do with the activist. Two years ago, Sea Shepherd activists boarded another Japanese ship and handcuffed themselves to the vessel with plastic ties, according to the Institute of Cetacean Research, a branch of Japan's fisheries ministry that deals with whaling. At the time, an Australian vessel helped return the two activists back to the Sea Shepherd, ICR said. Sea Shepherd has accused the Japanese ship ""Shonan Maru 2"" of destroying their vessel during the skirmish in the Southern Ocean -- a term used to describe parts of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic oceans that surround Antarctica. However, Japanese authorities deny their ship intentionally hit the catamaran and have said the activists were harassing their whaling fleet. The incident highlights an ongoing feud between Japanese whaling fleets and conservation agencies -- especially Sea Shepherd.

Petty Officer 2nd Class Jonathan Keefe, 25, is charged with dereliction of duty and impeding an official investigation surrounding the Iraqi's detention last September. Petty Officer 1st Class Julio Huertas, 28, faces similar charges. The Iraqi suspect, Ahmed Hashim Abed, complained to investigators he was punched during his detention. The case against the Navy SEALs has sparked outrage that the sailors are being tried at all for handling a suspect in the contractors' murders, one of the most notorious incidents in the Iraq war. The killings got widespread news coverage when the burned bodies of two of the contractors were paraded through the streets of Falluja and hanged from a bridge as their captors cheered. At a preliminary hearing in military court the judge, Cmdr. Tierney Carlos, announced he wants the cases of Keefe and Huertas moved to Camp Victory in Iraq to give them the ability to question the alleged victim in court. ""It doesn't make sense to me that the alleged victim is available for deposition and not available for trial,"" Carlos said in making his ruling for Keefe. ""In order to prevent prejudice to the accused, this case should be tried in Iraq."" Keefe's attorney had requested that the alleged victim be brought to the United States for questioning. ""This deposition will not be a substitute for the alleged victim's appearance,"" the judge said. Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew McCabe, the other SEAL, is accused of assaulting the detainee and punching him in the stomach. He faces a special court martial Wednesday. The charges against all three are the equivalent of misdemeanors in civilian court. If found guilty, the SEALs face a maximum sentence of a year in a military prison, demolition to the lowest Navy rank, a cut in pay, and a bad conduct discharge. ""Their military careers would be over,"" one of their attorneys told CNN.","Navy SEALs accused in alleged assault of an Iraqi man during his detention .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Teams of rescuers in Haiti's capital rushed to the city's Caribbean Market on Tuesday after a machine used to clear rubble caused a secondary collapse, trapping at least one Haitian in the rubble. A French excavation team was working the site, which collapsed in the January 12 earthquake, said Lt. Col. Christophe Renou of French Civil Protection. The team spotted a body in the rubble and brought in an excavation machine, which resembles a bulldozer, to attempt to reach the body, he said. The machine tipped into a hole, however, and caused further collapse, Renou said. Several Haitians were in the building at the time, he said, some helping in the search and others looking for useful items. Teams are aware of at least one person alive, confirmed with radar. Renou said he believes more people are trapped, but he doesn't know how many or whether they are alive. The French crews called U.S. and Mexican teams to the site to help with the rescue. The U.S. team brought more radar and lifting devices to try to extract the known survivor and reach any others, said Norman Skjelbreia, an incident commander from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The rescue mission is complicated, he said, by the Caribbean Market's debris and rubble and an adjacent building that is partially collapsed. More than 212,000 people died in the earthquake, Haitian officials said, and bodies are being recovered every day. Rescuers pulled an apparent survivor of the original quake, Evan Muncie, 28, from the rubble of a market on Monday. Doctors found him suffering from extreme dehydration and malnutrition, but without significant crushing injuries. Muncie's family told staff at the hospital that he had been missing since the quake, and was found in the wreckage of a market where he sold rice. Muncie told doctors that someone brought him water while he waited for rescue, but sounded confused and sometimes thought he was still in the rubble. By Wednesday, Muncie was in stable condition, according to University of Miami hospital spokeswoman Nery Ynclan, who said he was more alert and aware of his surroundings and was answering questions. Ynclan said Muncie had eaten and even asked for chocolate -- which staff provided in small quantities. Muncie will be at the hospital at least another week, she said. His brother and mother arrived Monday at the hospital to be with him, she said. Ynclan also said that crews returned Tuesday to the the site where Muncie was found and determined he may have been trapped in a room with some food or water. He was likely not pinned down, she said, but scrapes on his hands and feet indicate he may have tried to climb out. CNN's Ingrid Formanek and Danielle Dellorto contributed to this report.","Bulldozer at Caribbean Market causes secondary collapse .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities filed a criminal complaint Friday against a 56-year-old man whose scrawled note invoking ""Gilligan's Island"" led a Hawaiian Airlines pilot to turn around a Maui-bound flight and return Wednesday to Portland, Oregon. Joseph Hedlund Johnson, of Salem, Oregon, was charged with the federal crime of interference with the performance and duties of a flight crew member or attendant. He is expected to surrender to authorities on Monday. The crime of interference with the performance and duties of a flight crew member or attendant carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. According to the complaint and a 13-page supporting affidavit, Johnson and his girlfriend, Caroll Ann Miller, boarded Hawaiian Airlines Flight 39 on Wednesday morning bound for Kahului, Hawaii, on the island of Maui. Once aboard, Johnson became upset because he was not allowed to store his bag under his exit-row seat, according to the affidavit, which was written by an FBI agent after interviewing Johnson, Miller and the flight crew. About 45 minutes into the flight, Johnson gave a comment card in a sealed envelope to a flight attendant, who opened it, read it and gave it to the lead flight attendant, who then gave it to the captain, it said. ""I thought I was going to die, we were so high up,"" the card said. ""I thought to myself: I hope we don't crash and burn or worse yet landing in the ocean, living through it, only to be eaten by sharks, or worse yet, end up on some place like Gilligan's Island, stranded, or worse yet, be eaten by a tribe of headhunters, speaking of headhunters, why do they just eat outsiders, and not the family members? Strange ... and what if the plane ripped apart in mid-flight and we plumited (sic) to earth, landed on Gilligan's Island and then lived through it, and the only woman there was Mrs. Thurston Howell III? No Mary Anne (my favorite) no Ginger, just Lovey! If it were just her, I think I'd opt for the sharks, maybe the headhunters."" The ""Gilligan's Island"" references were to a 1960s-vintage CBS television comedy about a charter boat crew and their oddball passengers who become shipwrecked and wind up living together on a tropical island. The pilot told investigators that, considering Johnson's earlier behavior regarding his bag, he felt threatened by the card and decided -- now about 90 minutes into the flight -- to turn the jet around. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) scrambled two fighter jets to escort the plane back to Portland. Passengers were told that mechanical problems were to blame and did not learn about the perceived threat until after they arrived back at their starting point. There, Johnson -- apparently oblivious to his role in the decision to turn around -- was met by FBI agents, who interviewed him, the flight crew and his girlfriend. Investigators searched the plane, refueled it, and sent it off once again for Hawaii -- minus Johnson and Miller. Johnson told authorities that he had flown only about four times in his life and that the Maui-bound flight was his first over water; that he had occupied himself first by reading in-flight magazines and then by filling out comment cards provided by the airline. He said he had lifted the phrase for the card ""I thought I was going to die"" from comedian Mike Myers, the affidavit said. ""Johnson stated that he didn't think anyone would open it during the flight,"" the affidavit added. ""He told me that he thought the card was going to be taken back to an office somewhere, opened, and everyone in the room would 'get a laugh' from it, and that perhaps he'd even get some frequent flyer miles out of it. Johnson stated he didn't intend to scare anyone and he would not have written his name on the card if it was a threat. Johnson stated that he felt bad about what had happened and that he was sorry."" ""The safety and security of airline travel is of paramount importance, particularly following the events of Christmas Day,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson in a news release referring to the botched December 25 bombing aboard a Northwest Airlines jet. Authorities ""will take all necessary steps to assure that air travel is safe, and that standards of conduct for airline passengers are enforced. And everyone who flies should also know that communicating with a flight crew about crashing airplanes will not be viewed as a joke."" Johnson is to surrender Monday to authorities. CNN was unable to contact Johnson or Miller.","Incident disrupted Maui-bound flight on Wednesday .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Coming through on a promise to crack down on protesters on the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, Iran's security forces clashed with demonstrators Thursday, as hundreds of thousands filled a ""disruption-free"" Tehran square to hear their president announce the expansion of Iran's nuclear program. Iran's celebration of the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution culminated February 11, a date that three decades ago marked the end of the country's Western-backed monarchy and the start of an Islamic republic. A coalition of Iranian reformist groups had urged opponents of Iran's hardline regime to stage nonviolent protests at central Tehran's Azadi Square on Thursday, on the official anniversary of the ouster of Iran's shah. However, the Iranian government deployed thousands of police and plainclothes Basij militiamen in Tehran and other cities to quash anti-government protests during anniversary celebrations. Eyewitnesses said Iranian security forces quickly squelched out opposition protests, though CNN could not independently confirm the reports. ""The city was under siege. It was controlled entirely, it was impossible to protest the way people protested before,"" said Behzad Yaghmaian, author of ""Social Change in Iran."" Follow CNN's special coverage on Iran . ""So the dangers were much higher today."" Witnesses said there was some confusion about organizing the protests; for example, it wasn't clear to some whether they were supposed to hold up their signs before or after they arrived at Azadi Square, where President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was to speak. It appeared that the strength of the opposition response was less than other recent days of unrest in Iran, namely the protests on the holy day of Ashura in late December. Because of reporting restrictions, there was no way to independently confirm the turnout of the opposition. Yaghmaian said the so-called Green Movement, which is demanding democracy and fair elections, suffered a ""numbers shock."" ""The Green Movement anticipated a much larger turnout -- the turnout was not that large, and the turnout of the pro-government people was a lot larger than what people expected,"" said Yaghmaian, who teaches at New Jersey's Ramapo College. Are you there? Send your photos, video . Plainclothed and uniformed security agents assaulted vehicles carrying reformist Mehdi Karrubi, who ran for in the disputed June presidential elections, and former President Mohammad Khatami as their supporters poured onto the streets, opposition sources said. Militia members also beat the wife of opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi with batons, according to postings on the social networking Web site Facebook and opposition Web sites. The forces were preventing the opposition leaders and their followers from reaching Azadi, or Freedom Square, where Ahmadinejad delivered an anniversary address extolling the country's nuclear program to supporters. They fired on crowds in some areas and pepper-sprayed demonstrators in others, opposition groups said. CNN has not been able to independently confirm those reports. Members of the Basij, the paramilitary force loyal to Iran's hard-line leadership, attacked Karrubi while he was headed to a meeting with supporters, his son Mohammad-Taghi Karrubi told CNN. The militia broke a window in the car in which Karrubi was riding, an opposition Web site said. When he switched cars, that car also was attacked. ""The guards attacked, and the crowds came to him. When the crowds started to come and surrounded him, again the guards attacked with tear gas, tear as well as the batons and different kinds of weapons against the people. And unfortunately my father received very bad gas tears, and his face is burned,"" Mohammad-Taghi Karrubi said. iReport video of opposition supporters in Tehran . The reformist Raheh Sabz Web site said plainclothes policemen arrested Karrubi's son Ali, as he tried to protect his father's car. Mohammad-Taghi Karrubi confirmed the arrest of his brother Ali, the third of the leader's four sons. ""My younger brother is arrested by police. And we were surprised because for two days we just came to demonstrate, to rally, to participate to show what we want and ask for our rights,"" he said. The government said that if protesters disrupt state-sanctioned marches, they will be jailed until at least April 9, the end of the Persian holiday of Norooz. The holiday marks the start of spring. Plainclothes security forces wielding tear gas and batons also attacked Khatami's vehicle and supporters, as he headed to Azadi Square, forcing him to abort a plan to walk there alongside followers, the Raheh Sabz site said. Two reformist figures -- Mohammad Reza Khatami, the brother of the former president with a similar name, and his wife, Zahra Eshraghi -- were arrested, opposition groups also said. YouTube video appears to show regime motorcycle burning . The Facebook page of Dr. Zahra Rahnavard, Moussavi's wife, said she had planned to join demonstrators at Sadeghiye Square, when she ""was surrounded and attacked."" ""Plainclothes militia physically assaulted her and beat her with batons at her head and back. Zahra Rahnavard after this incident with the support of a large crowd of people who made a human shield to protect her, was able to leave the area,"" the Facebook page said. Iran's official Press TV took note of opposition protests, saying ""a few hundred supporters"" of Moussavi and Karrubi gathered in a western Tehran district, and Karrubi was seen among the demonstrators. ""Police had stepped up security in the area to prevent possible disturbances,"" it reported. Follow CNNIranDesk on twitter . The chaotic scenes drew expressions of concern from the West, with the United States and the European Union calling on Iran to end reported abuses against its people. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the United States stands ""by the universal rights of Iranians to express themselves freely and to do so without intimidation or violence."" ""Iranians have gone out into the streets to do just that in a peaceful way, and we will continue to monitor it and continue to express our condemnation and dismay for any violence that should result in the exercising of those universal rights."" Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said the EU is concerned about ""reports that opposition leaders have been subjected to violence and intimidation"" and that some may have been detained. Observers say the pro-government Azadi Square demonstration was a well-choreographed event. One observer in the throng told CNN a relaxed and supportive atmosphere prevailed at the demonstration. There was no sign at a pro-government parade of Basij militia members, ever-present during opposition events, but they were seen stationed away from the main area of the demonstration. Government officials distributed cartons of milk, juice boxes, lemonade and cupcakes in the crowds, which appeared to number in the hundreds of thousands, the witness said. Women who usually stay home went out, and there were a number of people from outside Tehran attending, the observer said. ""They got what they wanted: a disruption-free rally,"" the observer said. ""There were no potential 'greens' in that crowd."" Flag-waving and cheering supporters heard Ahmadinejad announce that Iran has produced its first batch of 20 percent-enriched uranium and will soon triple production -- a claim that the United States dismissed. He also touched on familiar topics: He lashed out at the West, particularly the United States, and criticized its relationship with Iran's rival, Israel. Ahmadinejad's speech at Azadi Square ended without incident. ""There are those who stand against us because what they want is to control the Middle East and to control the world,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""And an independent Iran, a free Iran, a developed Iran, a powerful Iran will naturally be a challenge for their goal. And that is why they are hostile to the Iranian nation."" Since a disputed presidential election in June, anti-government protesters have turned public gatherings into rallies against hard-liner Ahmadinejad, who was declared the overwhelming winner of the race, and street demonstrations were anticipated on the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. Over the volatile months since June, police have responded to such demonstrations with mass arrests, denouncing protesters as anti-Islamic and against the revolution. In the latest big street confrontation, on the holy day of Ashura in December, witnesses said hundreds of people were detained and seven were killed, with responsibility for the fatalities denied by the Iranian regime. As the anniversary day approached, opposition leaders urged their followers to demonstrate peacefully, and Iran has imposed tight restrictions on foreign reporters covering the anniversary, busing them to and from Ahmadinejad's speech to prevent them from reporting on skirmishes on the streets. The precautions were meant to prevent a repeat of overt anti-government displays on other key occasions that have embarrassed and inflamed Iranian authorities. Pick-ups roamed the streets of Tehran, blaring pro-government slogans and songs from speakers, a witness said, and residents in the Iranian capital said Wednesday that text messages on many messaging services have been blocked and Internet speeds have slowed to a crawl. At Aria-Shahr square in western Tehran and in various other parts of the city, security forces fired on and tear-gassed demonstrators who chanted ""Death to the dictator,"" and ""Death to (Supreme Leader Ayatollah) Khamenei,"" according to opposition reports. Undeterred, the demonstrators chanted on, and many of them wore masks or handkerchiefs over their faces. Opposition videos surfacing from Tehran showed the wrath of demonstrators. One showed protesters tearing up a poster of Ayatollah Khomeini, the late founder of the Islamic Revolution, and Khamenei. Another showed people stomping on an image of Khamenei. One video showed a man apparently stripped from the waist up put in a choke hold and punched in the head by a helmeted security force member.","Militia, police keep protesters away from pro-government rally in Tehran .

"(CNN) -- A California judge ruled Wednesday to allow cameras in a federal courtroom to document a challenge to Proposition 8, a measure banning same-sex marriage. The courtroom footage will not be streamed live, but will be uploaded on the Web site YouTube daily, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Proposition 8 passed with about 52.5 percent of the vote in November 2008. A lesbian couple and a gay couple who were banned from marrying filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of the new measure, the affiliate reported. The nonjury trial is to begin on January 11 in federal court in San Francisco. The rare decision to allow cameras in a federal courtroom was influenced by intense media attention, court officials said. The legal battle over Proposition 8 has prompted passionate debate and in the past has spurred protests outside courtrooms. Opponents of the ban say it improperly altered the state's Constitution to restrict a fundamental right guaranteed in the state charter. Ban supporters say Californians long have had the right to change their state Constitution through ballot initiatives.","California judge rules to allow cameras in a federal courtroom .

"Apex, Nevada (CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Monday that he is ""very proud"" of having told Barack Obama early on that he believed he was a viable candidate for president and could win election. Responding to the controversy surrounding a newly published remark he made privately about Obama's race in 2008, Reid sought to emphasize his longstanding support for the nation's first African-American president. ""I can still remember the meeting that took place in my office with Sen. Barack Obama, telling him that I think he can be elected president,"" Reid said. Obama ""was kind of surprised that the Democratic leader was calling this new senator over to suggest that he could be elected president,"" he added. A new book quotes Reid, D-Nevada, as saying privately in 2008 that Obama could be successful as a black candidate in part because of his ""light-skinned"" appearance and speaking patterns ""with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one."" Reid said Monday that numerous prominent African-American officials, including NAACP Chairman Julian Bond and Attorney General Eric Holder, have called him to offer support amid the controversy that began over the weekend. ""I've apologized to everyone with the sound of my voice that I could have used a better choice of words,"" he said after an event announcing a new energy project in his home state. ""And I'll continue doing my work for the African-American community."" Reid said that ""as a very young man,"" he became a leader of civil rights efforts, including the integration of the gaming community. He added that Interior Secretary Ken Salazar called him to say he should ""tell everybody that you have done more for diversity in the United States Senate than all the rest of the people put together."" Asked whether he should apologize to voters, Reid -- who had issued a statement over the weekend apologizing ""for offending any and all Americans"" -- did not answer directly and instead cited the support he has received from around the country and within his own state. ""I'm not going to dwell on this any more,"" Reid said. ""It's in the book. I've made all the statements I'm going to make."" iReport: What do you think about the words Reid used? The book he referred to, ""Game Change,"" went on sale Monday. The authors write that ""Reid was convinced, in fact, that Obama's race would help him more than hurt him in a bid for the Democratic nomination."" Reid apologized in a statement sent to CNN over the weekend. ""I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words,"" he said. He added, ""I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans, especially African-Americans, for my improper comments. I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign and have worked as hard as I can to advance President Obama's legislative agenda."" Reid called the president Saturday and apologized. In a statement issued after the call, Obama expressed support for Reid, saying, ""As far as I am concerned, the book is closed."" Speaking to CNN contributor Roland Martin, Obama described Reid as ""a friend of mine. He has been a stalwart champion of voting rights, civil rights."" ""This is a good man who has always been on the right side of history. For him to have used some inartful language in trying to praise me and for people to try and make hay out of that makes absolutely no sense,"" he said in the interview, which will air this month. ""I guarantee you the average person, white or black, right now is less concerned about what Harry Reid said in a quote in a book a couple of years ago than they are about how we are going to move the country forward, and that's where we need to direct our attention."" A senior administration official said Monday that Obama will go to Nevada in February to campaign on behalf of Reid. iReporter: ""I don't think he should be kicked out of the Senate"" Reid also called a host of African-American political figures, including House Democrats Barbara Lee of California and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina; the Rev. Al Sharpton; CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile; and the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Wade Henderson. Republicans pounced on the controversy. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, head of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, called for Reid to give up his leadership posts after the ""embarrassing and racially insensitive"" remarks. Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele, speaking Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" also called for Reid to step down. ""Racism and racist conversations have no place today in America,"" the first African-American GOP chairman said. Steele also was on the defensive for a remark he made last week. Speaking to Fox News, Steele said the GOP platform ""is one of the best political documents that's been written in the last 25 years, honest Injun on that."" ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace said lawmakers from both parties have called that a racial slur. ""Well, if it is, I apologize for it. It's not an intent to be a racial slur. I wasn't intending to say a racial slur at all,"" Steele said. iReporter: Mixing race and politics equals trouble . Numerous Democrats came to Reid's defense. The Congressional Black Caucus said Sunday that it had accepted his apology and dismissed calls for the Nevada Democrat to step down. ""Sen. Reid's record provides a stark contrast to actions of Republicans to block legislation that would benefit poor and minority communities,"" Lee, chairwoman of the caucus, said in a written statement. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-District of Columbia, a former chairwoman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, issued a statement saying, ""Like President Barack Obama, African-Americans are likely to accept Majority Leader Reid's apology for an obvious reason. He has earned it."" She added, ""Harry Reid's opponents will not find a welcome mat in the black community if they seek to capitalize on the Reid remark. While Sen. Reid has been producing for African-Americans, many of his critics were opposing him on these same issues."" Democrats rejected a parallel drawn by some Republicans between Reid's remark and one by former Sen. Trent Lott, R-Mississippi, in 2002. Lott lost his post as Senate majority leader after saying the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had been elected president. Thurmond had run as a segregationist candidate in 1948. ""There is a big double standard here,"" Steele said on NBC. ""When Democrats get caught saying racist things, you know, an apology is enough."" Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia, chairman of the Democratic Party, shot back, telling NBC that ""there is no comparison"" between the two sets of remarks. Reid is embroiled in a tough re-election campaign to stay in the Senate. Only one-third of Nevada voters have a favorable opinion of him, while 52 percent have an unfavorable opinion of the four-term senator, according to a survey by Mason-Dixon Polling and Research for the Las Vegas Review-Journal released over the weekend. The poll was conducted Tuesday through Thursday, before news of Reid's comments broke. CNN's Dana Bash, Mark Preston, Rebecca Sinderbrand and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama: Reid is friend who ""has always been on right side of history""

"(CNN) -- A man charged in the beheading death of his seatmate on a Greyhound Canada bus last summer is not criminally responsible because he is mentally ill, a judge ruled Thursday, said CNN affiliate CBC News. The ruling means that Vince Weiguang Li will be hospitalized at a psychiatric facility until he undergoes a review by Manitoba's Criminal Code Review Board in 90 days, CBC said. ""The goal of criminal law is to punish criminals, not persons who have a severe mental illness,"" Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench Judge John Scurfield wrote in the ruling, CBC reported. However, the ruling angered relatives of Tim McLean Jr., 22, who died on the bus July 30. ""The bottom line is, he is getting away with murder,"" Vana Smart, McLean's sister, told CBC.  Watch how the verdict angers the victim's family » . Prosecutors told reporters Thursday they had no choice but to ask the judge to find Li not criminally responsible. ""This was justice because the correct conclusion was reached,"" prosecutor Joyce Dalmyn said, according to CBC. ""Mr. Li is a schizophrenic. Mr. Li had a severe mental disease. Mr. Li, in my opinion and in the opinion of the psychiatrists, had no idea what he was doing was wrong."" Li, 40, was charged with second-degree murder in McLean's death. A witness on the bus, which was headed from Edmonton, Alberta, to Winnipeg, Manitoba, said a passenger repeatedly stabbed and then decapitated McLean as horrified passengers watched. Just before his death, the victim had been sleeping with his head leaning against the window. ""There was a blood-curdling scream. I was just reading my book and all of a sudden I heard it,"" Garnet Caton, who was sitting in front of the two men, told Canadian TV at the time. She said the knife-wielding man shouted at the other passengers to get off the bus, and they did. ""Me and a trucker that stopped and the Greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that,"" Caton said. ""And when we all got up (to the door), we saw that the guy was cutting off the guy's head."" Thirty-four passengers were on the bus. Police said at the time it was unclear what prompted the attack. Witnesses said Li's weapon was a large butcher knife. Li was arrested after an hours-long standoff, during which he remained in the bus with McLean's body. Police said he was seized after he broke a window and attempted to jump from the bus. ""Mr. Li is also a victim here,"" said Ruth Ann Craig of the Canadian Mental Health Association, according to CBC. ""What's going to happen to Mr. Li is not a cakewalk."" He will be housed in a locked psychiatric ward, Craig said, while he undergoes assessment and treatment to determine whether he is a risk to himself or society. But Tim McLean's mother, Carol deDelley, said she will fight to change the law regarding these types of crimes. ""I'm going to do everything I can to make a change here,"" she said, CBC reported. McLean's father said he is also disappointed with the ruling. ""We've all lost a family member,"" he told CBC. ""This isn't the right result.""","Vince Weiguang Li will be hospitalized at a psychiatric facility .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- At least one organization attempting to deliver aid to Haiti continued to be plagued Sunday by delays and logistical problems, but aid was getting to those who need it most, officials said. Doctors Without Borders said Sunday that, despite guarantees from the United Nations and the U.S. Defense Department, its cargo plane carrying an inflatable surgical hospital was blocked from landing in Port-au-Prince the day before and was rerouted to Samana, Dominican Republic. Samana is in the eastern portion of the Dominican Republic and across the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, shared by the two nations, from Port-au-Prince. The material was being sent by truck from Samana, said the group, also known in French as Médecins Sans Frontières. However, the re-routing added a 24-hour delay to the hospital's arrival. A second Doctors Without Borders plane was able to land on Sunday. That plane carried additional medical supplies and hospital equipment, the group said, adding it is still concerned about delays in the delivery of vital supplies. ""If this plane is also rerouted, then the hospital will be further delayed, in a situation where thousands of wounded are still in need of life saving treatment,"" a group statement said. It was unclear Sunday afternoon whether the plane had landed. See photos, details of some of the missing in Haiti . The surgical hospital includes two operating theaters, an intensive-care unit, 100-bed hospitalization capacity, an emergency room and all the necessary equipment needed for sterilizing material. ""MSF teams are currently working around the clock in five different hospitals in Port-au-Prince, but only two operating theaters are fully functional, while a third operating theater has been improvised for minor surgery due to the massive influx of wounded and lack of functional referral structures,"" the organization said. The group said two of its medical teams have performed more than 100 operations since arriving in the country, but frustrations are high over the delays. An emergency communications officer with the group in Haiti said conditions are growing worse for patients and ""we need the inflatable hospital -- if it ever arrives."" ""Patients who were not critical only three days ago are now in critical phases,"" she wrote in a news release. ""This means that people will die from preventable infections. It's horrible."" Planes are asked to divert elsewhere if they don't have the fuel to stay in a holding pattern, Col. Buck Elton of U. S. Special Operations Command South told reporters Sunday. Only two planes had been diverted Sunday, he said. Asked about the matter on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, Lt. Gen. P.K. Keen, deputy commander of U.S. Southern Command, said the Port-au-Prince airport, which is being run by the U.S. military, is operating at maximum capacity 24 hours a day. ""It's a matter of balance between getting relief supplies on the ground, getting the people on the ground that are necessary to get those relief supplies distributed, and getting the logistical capacity on the ground to continue that, and the vehicles so we can get it out by ground as well as by air,"" he said. Full coverage of the earthquake in Haiti . More aid was on the way. The National Organization for the Advancement of Haitians held an earthquake survival kit drive at the Haitian embassy in Washington, saying it was accepting items including baby formula, diapers, toiletries, vitamins, medicines, batteries and clothing. Hundreds of people turned out, and they brought enough to fill several trucks full. The overflow of supplies was piled along the embassy's walls and stairwells. U.S. paratroopers using helicopters from an aircraft carrier delivered 130,000 daily-ration packets on Saturday, Keen of U.S. Southern Command said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Some 70,000 bottles of water were also delivered, he said. One helicopter could not land and was forced to drop supplies, Keen said, but the delivery otherwise encountered no problems and was orderly. Keen called it a good day. Also Saturday, a member of the U.S. Coast Guard helped deliver a Haitian newborn aboard a Coast Guard helicopter. The mother -- one of five Haitians the Coast Guard was transferring from Port-au-Prince to Cap Haitien for medical reasons -- went into labor as the helicopter was refueling aboard the Coast Guard Cutter Tahoma, the Coast Guard said. The mother and child were taken to a hospital in Cap Haitien and were in good condition, according to the Coast Guard. In Washington on Sunday, hundreds of people from different faiths mourned the victims of the quake and donated money during a service at the National Cathedral. Among those in attendance were Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Raymond Joseph, the Haitian ambassador to the United States. Joseph asked the mourners to continue that support even as the tragedy fades from the headlines. ""I'm thanking you in the name of the people of Haiti and I'm asking you that what you've begun here tonight shouldn't stop -- it should continue until Haiti gains its place among the nations of the world, as it should. ""Please, stay with us until we totally rebuild,"" Joseph said. The World Food Programme said it reached 40,000 people in and around Port-au-Prince with high-energy biscuits. The organization said its goal is to reach another 60,000 people on Sunday. Convoys and shipments carrying ready-to-eat foods continue to arrive, the group said. The WFP's convoy was the first food to arrive in Leogane, about 18 kilometers (11 miles) west of Port-au-Prince and close to where the earthquake was centered, it said in a statement. Nearly every building collapsed, and tens of thousands of people are believed to have been killed. Survivors are living in makeshift camps. In addition, the organization was distributing hot meals in some places, such as hospitals and schools, and has begun setting up kitchens at distribution sites, it said. The Red Cross said in a statement Sunday it had built latrines for 1,000 people and supplied medical kits for 2,000 patients to two hospitals. Seven truckloads of medical supplies should arrive in Port-au-Prince Sunday night, it said. Keen told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that the United States intends to continue helping Haiti as long as there is a need. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush kicked off a fundraising drive Saturday -- a donation push called the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. George W. Bush told CNN's John King in an interview that aired Sunday, ""One thing I am concerned about is that on these -- during these crises, all kinds of fake charities spring up. ... We will make sure the money is accounted for and there's transparency, and [it is] properly spent.""

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Motorbike gunmen killed a foreign aid worker in Kabul Monday, the Afghan Interior Ministry has said. Aid worker Gayle Williams was one of 23 expatriates who worked for SERVE Afghanistan. In a separate incident, two German soldiers and five Afghan children were killed when a suicide bomber struck an Afghan-German military convoy in northern Afghanistan, the provincial governor in Kunduz said. Gayle Williams, 34, had dual British and South African nationality and worked for SERVE Afghanistan (Serving Emergency Relief and Vocational Enterprise), an inter-denominational Christian charity that helps the disabled, the organization's chairman said in a statement. Williams was shot in the western part of the city, Interior Ministry spokesman Zemarai Bashary said, while walking to work. She died shortly after the attack, SERVE Afghanistan chairman Mike Lyth said. ""She was a person who always loved the Afghans and was dedicated to serving those who are disabled,"" Lyth said. ""Needless to say, we are all in shock."" Williams was one of 23 expatriates who worked for SERVE Afghanistan, which also employs 450 Afghans in the country. A statement on SERVE Afghanistan's Web site -- attributed only to ""C and E"" -- described Williams as ""one of the inspiring people of the world who truly put others before herself."" ""She was killed violently while caring for the most forgotten people in the world; the poor and the disabled,"" the statement said. ""She herself would not regret taking the risk of working in Afghanistan. She was where she wanted to be -- holding out a helping hand to those in need."" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned her killing as well as the recent killings of two U.N. aid workers in Somalia. ""The secretary-general deplores these acts of deliberate violence against those who are making every effort to alleviate the dire suffering of Somali and Afghan citizens,"" Ban's spokeswoman Michele Montas said at Monday's daily briefing in New York. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the death, saying on its Web site that it killed the ""foreign woman"" for preaching Christianity in the country and adding that it had been following the woman for some time. In August, aid groups in Afghanistan said in a report that attacks on aid workers have forced them to scale back relief work. The bomber who attacked the Afghan-German convoy was riding a bike when he detonated his explosives as the vehicles traveled outside the northern Afghan city of Kunduz, Gov. Mohammed Omar said. Two German soldiers and two Afghan civilians were wounded, according to Omar. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in an Internet posting, claiming to have killed 12 German soldiers. The Afghan and German forces went to Chahar Dara district to investigate enemy activity in the region when they were attacked, Omar said. NATO's International Security Assistance Forces confirmed that a suicide attack in Kunduz province killed two of its soldiers and five local children, but did not reveal the ISAF soldiers' nationalities, as part of its standing policy. ISAF spokesman Brig. Gen. Richard Blanchette said: ""Acts such as this, which offer nothing but violence and death, will not deter us in our commitment to create a better Afghanistan."" NATO said one ISAF soldier and a civilian were also wounded in the attack. The German Defense Ministry in Berlin confirmed a bomb attack near a base that houses a German provincial reconstruction team in the town of Kunduz, a ministry spokesman said. It had no information on casualties. Germany has committed 3,200 troops to support NATO's mission in Afghanistan. The latest deaths bring to 25 the number of German soldiers who have died in the Afghan war since 2002.

"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (CNN)  -- At least 50 people have died in a school collapse in in Petionville, near the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, officials said Friday night. Haitians try to help victims at a school that collapsed Friday in Petionville, near Port-au-Prince. Rescue personnel planned to continue working into the night to dig out students and teachers buried in the rubble, the Red Cross said. At least 100 people have been injured, the Haitian Civil Protection Bureau said. The death toll is expected to rise. Officials said the school could have held as many as 700 people when the collapse occurred at 10 a.m. (10 a.m. ET) Some students were in class while others were in a playground, Haitian media reported. ""We are looking at major casualties here,"" Claudon said. He said dozens of students appeared to be trapped inside but couldn't give an exact number. However, he said it was a typical school day and the building had been crowded. Most of the students at the College La Promesse Evangelique range in age from 10 to 20, he said, but there are younger ones as well. Haitian press reports said the school has kindergarten, primary and secondary students. President Rene Preval and Prime Minister Michele Pierre-Louis toured the disaster area. ""I heard and saw with my own eyes children appealing for help,"" Preval was quoted as saying on the French language www.haitipressnetwork.com. ""We are taking all necessary steps,"" Pierre-Louis said. "" The government has mobilized to save those who can be saved."" Preval asked residents to stay away from the area so police and rescue officials could do their work unimpeded. Michaele Gedeon, president of Haiti's Red Cross, said she heard the voices of distraught children as rescuers tried to calm them while she was on the phone attempting to coordinate emergency rescue efforts.  Watch as the Red Cross official describes the scene » . ""On the phone, you can hear so many children, you know, crying, crying and saying, 'this one is dead,' 'that one is dead,' "" she said. Claudon said hundreds of bystanders and rescue workers were digging through the rubble, but ""what we need right now is heavy search-and-rescue equipment."" Claudon later said, ""local authorities are doing their best."" Fifty to 60 patients, 30 of them severely injured, were taken to Trinite Hospital in Port-au-Prince, said Isabelle Mouniaman Nara, the head of mission in the capital for Medecins sans Frontieres. Another 150 patients were treated elsewhere, Nara said Friday night. The situation at Trinite ""is under control right now,"" she said. Trinite is the only hospital open in Port-au-Prince, the group said. The other two, General Hospital and Hospital de la Paix, are closed by strikes. The school is in an extremely poor part of town, and the roads are nearly impassable, local journalist Clarens Renois said. A United Nations helicopter was unable to land, Renois said. ""The school is poorly built,"" said Amelia Shaw, a journalist with United Nations TV who visited the scene. Renois described the building as ""not quite solid"" with ""weak construction."" The school consisted of two floors with an addition built in the rear over a 200-foot ravine, Shaw said. The steep hillside, she said, is covered with shanty-like housing on both sides. The disaster occurred when the second floor crumbled onto the first, Shaw said. A disaster assistance response team from the U.S. Agency for International Development arrived on the scene within hours of the collapse, the agency said in a release. After assessing the situation, USAID activated its partner the Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue Team. That team will be composed of 38 personnel, four search-and-rescue dogs and 31,000 pounds of rescue equipment and is expected to arrive Saturday. The Urban Search and Rescue Team will be accompanied by four additional USAID disaster experts. U.S. Ambassador Janet Sanderson expressed her condolences, haitipressnetwork.com reported.","NEW: At least 50 students killed, 100 injured; toll is expected to rise .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The former hedge fund manager who faked his own suicide to avoid prison time for fraud will spend an extra two years in jail for failing to surrender himself, according to the U.S attorney's office. Sam Israel tried to get out of serving a 20 year sentenced by faking his suicide. It added two years. Federal Judge Kenneth Karas sentenced Sam Israel III in White Plains, New York, on Wednesday, giving him two more years in addition to his previous sentence. Federal guidelines call for a 12- to 18-month sentence, but Karas noted that Israel's crime ""took a fair amount of planning,"" and he criticized the former hedge fund manager for ""thumbing his nose at the system."" The additional sentence will begin after Israel serves his first 20 years for fraud. Israel admitted to authorities in March that he had faked his own suicide to escape his jail sentence. He was supposed to report to a Massachusetts prison in June of 2008 to serve a 20-year sentence for defrauding investors of Bayou Management out of approximately $450 million. But he did not show up at the facility. Days later, his sport-utility vehicle was found abandoned on a bridge in upstate New York, with the words ""Suicide is Painless"" -- title of the theme song for the television show ""M.A.S.H."" -- written in dust on the the hood. Authorities determined the suicide setup was a ruse and launched a major manhunt to find Israel. He turned himself in to law enforcement July 2, 2008.","Judge says Sam Israel ""thumbed his nose at the system""

"(CNN) -- Willie Mitchell, the Memphis producer whose percussive, string-and-horn-tinged R&B sound shaped '70s hits by such artists as Al Green and Ann Peebles, died Tuesday. He was 81. Mitchell had been having health problems and went into cardiac arrest in December, according to his grandson, Lawrence. Mitchell ""was doing music all the way till he couldn't,"" his grandson, whom Mitchell helped raise, said. He worked on Rod Stewart's most recent album, ""Soulbook,"" as well as Solomon Burke's forthcoming CD. Despite being in and out of the hospital, Mitchell would write horn and string arrangements one day and record them the next, Lawrence Mitchell said. In the 1970s, Mitchell was a principal in Hi Records and owned Royal Studios, where musicians such as drummers Al Jackson and Howard Grimes and guitarist Teenie Hodges plied their trade. His biggest success came with Green, whom he guided through a number of '70s hits, including ""I'm Still in Love With You,"" ""Let's Stay Together,"" ""Love and Happiness"" and ""Call Me."" In 2003, he and Green re-teamed for ""I Can't Stop,"" their first album together since 1985. Green has often talked about how important Mitchell was to his sound, working him until his voice was just so -- a difference that can be heard on his pre-Mitchell songs, such as ""Back Up Train."" Mitchell also helmed Peebles' ""I Can't Stand the Rain"" and O.V. Wright's ""The Ace of Spades."" A musician himself, he had several R&B hits in the '60s. Memphis named the street in front of Royal Studios for Mitchell in 2004. Funeral arrangements were pending, Lawrence Mitchell said.","Willie Mitchell, helmed key early '70s R&B hits, dies at 81 .

"(CNN) -- NASA has postponed for one day the scheduled launch of a rocket carrying a solar probe. The space agency plans to launch an Atlas V rocket carrying its Solar Dynamics Observatory, which it says will study the sun ""in greater detail than ever before."" After delaying the launch three times because of windy conditions Wednesday at Cape Canaveral, Florida, NASA said it will try again Thursday, with a launch window of 10:23 a.m. to 11:23 a.m. ET. ""The vehicle's flight control system sensed wind loads exceeding the limit, prompting the abrupt end to the countdown,"" NASA said. The agency says the observatory will provide a better understanding of the sun and its role in space weather events such as solar flares, which can wreak havoc on Earth. The observatory is designed to deliver solar images with resolution 10 times better than high-definition television, according to NASA. The five-year mission ""will determine how the sun's magnetic field is generated, structured and converted into violent solar events like turbulent solar wind, solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections,"" according to the agency. The solar wind, a stream of electrically charged particles flowing out from the sun, fills the entire solar system with charged particles and magnetic fields, according to NASA. Solar flares are actual explosions in the sun's atmosphere, the largest of them equal to billions of one-megaton nuclear bombs. And Coronal Mass Ejections, or CMEs, are eruptions that launch solar material into space at a high rate of speed. Such events can put astronauts at risk, as well as aircraft flying over Earth's North or South Poles, and can also disrupt satellite communications, navigational systems and power grids, NASA said. In 1969, for instance, a solar current knocked a power grid serving Quebec, Canada, off-line for nine hours. ""That's a direct impact on life and society,"" said Richard Fisher, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division. He is in charge of Wednesday's launch. In addition, changes in magnetic energy such as those around sunspots can change Global Positioning System signals, making them less accurate . ""If you're landing a great big jet airliner in a low-visibility situation and you have one of these events that causes a misinterpretation of location by 150 to 200 yards, that's big stuff when you're trying to hit a runway with these instruments,"" Fisher said. There's no way to predict space weather. Officials hope the Solar Dynamics Observatory can provide information to help change that. ""This is the most advanced spacecraft we've ever designed to study the sun and its dynamic behavior,"" Fisher said. The sun, he said, ""has this trick of converting magnetic energy into other kinds of energy that can affect the Earth."" ""I believe we're up to the point now where we can probably predict when something like this is more or less likely and you can at least take precautions,"" Fisher said about solar weather. A warning system, for example, could help power grid operators avoid an outage by taking some of the grid's load off or finding alternative configurations. The sun's effect wasn't an issue for the Earth until the technological advances in electronics over the last hundred years, he said. The observatory is ""going to give us good awareness of the dynamics of the sun, and we're going to be able to make estimates on when we should take precautions with our satellites or with airline operations or with Department of Defense systems,"" Fisher said. ""We have an increasing pressure on science to try and predict what's going to happen on the sun, and that's the scientific bent of this (SDO) satellite, is to try to get a handle on it."" The observatory contains three major instruments that scientists believe will send data back to Earth for at least five years. The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly will allow scientists to see the sun in high resolution. The imaging assembly will also observe the outer layer of the sun's atmosphere, and the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment will measure its ultraviolet spectrum every 10 seconds. ""Space weather forecasting is in its infancy ... just like hurricane forecasting was years ago,"" according to an article on NASA's Web site by Liz Citrin, SDO project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, which developed and will manage the mission. ""We built up experience in collecting data, designed models, tested those models and now look what we can do."" The observatory will snap an image of the sun in eight wavelengths every 10 seconds, NASA said. It will remain in continuous contact with a station at the White Sands Complex in southern New Mexico. ""The biggest challenge of this mission was the data rate,"" Citrin wrote in the article. ""SDO will blast back 1.5 terabytes of information every day. ... That's equivalent to a half-million song downloads. It's unprecedented."" The observatory is the first mission of NASA's Living With a Star program. The program is aimed at increasing understanding of the sun in order to address its effect on Earth. The mission was supposed to launch in August 2008, but scientists decided more testing was needed. CNN Radio's Shelby Erdman contributed to this report.","Solar observatory aims to provide better understanding of sun's role in space weather .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Filipino film ""Himala"" has been awarded the CNN APSA Viewers Choice Award for Best Asia-Pacific Film of all Time. ""The Screening Room"" presenter Myleene Klass arrives at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards in Queensland, Australia. Thousands of CNN viewers voted on ""The Screening Room"" Web site to honor Ishmael Bernal's 1982 film with the accolade, which is jointly awarded by CNN and the region's prestigious Asia Pacific Screen Awards (APSA). ""The Screening Room's"" Myleene Klass presented the award Tuesday in front of a crowd of over 700 film industry figures at a special ceremony on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. Bernal's austere tale of a young woman who goes on a healing crusade after seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary, which stars Filipino actress Nora Aunor, took the prize with 32 percent of the vote. It came in ahead of ahead of more widely known films like Japanese Akira Kurosawa's ""Shichinin no samurai"" (""Seven Samurai""), which took second place and ""Wo hu cang long"" (""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"") by Taiwan's Ang Lee, which snared third. Other films in the shortlist included Chan-wook Park's ""Oldboy"" from South Korea and Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki's animated film ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"" (""Spirited Away""). ""Whatever the reason, I do feel we deserve this award,"" said ""Himala"" producer Bibsy Carballo, ""If only as a tribute to our people who in once a great while decide to come together as one, forget their petty squabbles and divisiveness, and make a declaration of support for this troubled nation, and its tremendously talented and good-hearted if unfortunate population. Long live 'Himala!'"" When it was first released in 1982, ""Himala"" was picked for the official selection at Berlin International Film Festival, as well as a number of other festivals, and Nora Aunor was nominated for Best Actress. A total of 32 films representing 17 countries from Kazakhstan to Korea and the Islamic Republic of Iran to India were finalists at this year's Asia Pacific Screen Awards. Kazakh picture ""Tulpan,"" by director Sergei Dvortsevoy, which tells the story of a family of sheep and goat herders, took home the main feature prize.

"Washington (CNN) -- One-time Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin may have sent a clear message to the political world, analysts say, by signing a deal to become a TV commentator. That message: She's unlikely to run in the 2012 presidential race. ""I do think maybe it suggests, sadly for Democrats, that she might not be running,"" said Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala. ""Democrats ... are pretty confident they can defeat Sarah Palin. She's not going to beat Barack Obama."" The former Alaska governor has signed a deal with Fox News to appear as a contributor on the network, a source with knowledge of the agreement confirms to CNN. There are no plans for Palin to anchor her own program, the source said. ""Let's first hope for [Fox News President] Roger Ailes' sake that she doesn't quit that job the way she quit her job as governor of Alaska,"" Begala joked. Nancy Pfotenhauer, a former McCain presidential campaign spokesperson, also indicated that Palin's new job is a possible sign of things to come. ""There's a slight indication she may not run,"" she said. ""I assume this is a business decision on the part of both Fox News and on Gov. Palin's part."" Begala, though, did give Palin praise for her TV gig. ""It's indoor work. It's interesting and lucrative. I'm all for it,"" he said. ""Congratulations for the former governor of Alaska."" Palin is hardly alone in top Republicans-turned-TV talking heads. After the 2008 GOP presidential primaries, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee joined Fox News as the host of his own show. Karl Rove, a former top aide to President George W. Bush, also joined Fox News as a commentator. Michael Steele, the current chairman of the Republican National Committee, was once a Fox News contributor as well. Mary Matalin, a former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, is now a CNN contributor alongside her husband James Carville and Begala -- top Democratic aides to then President Clinton. One of Begala and Carville's colleagues -- George Stephanopolous -- has been a long-time political analyst at ABC News, who later hosted his own Sunday TV show ""This Week."" Most recently, he was named as the host of ABC's ""Good Morning America."" On MSNBC, former Florida GOP Rep. Joe Scarborough now hosts his own TV show called ""Morning Joe."" Pat Buchanan, a leading conservative voice and former presidential candidate, also graces MSNBC's airwaves giving his take on politics. Since leaving office, Palin has become a vocal critic of the Obama administration's policies. She recently released her autobiography ""Going Rogue"" and toured the country promoting her book.","Sarah Palin will appear as a contributor on Fox News, source tells CNN .

"Marjah, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Twelve Afghan civilians were killed Sunday when two rockets fired by coalition forces in southern Afghanistan missed their intended target, as the Taliban showed stiff resistance to the NATO assault against the militant group. ""We deeply regret this tragic loss of life,"" U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, commander of the International Security Assistance Force, said in a statement. ""The current operation in Central Helmand is aimed at restoring security and stability to this vital area of Afghanistan. It's regrettable that in the course of our joint efforts, innocent lives were lost."" Coalition forces fired two rockets with the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System at insurgents firing upon Afghan and ISAF forces, but they struck about 300 meters off their intended target, ISAF said. The incident happened in the Nad Ali district of Helmand province, where NATO forces have launched Operation Moshtarak, a huge offensive by an international coalition of 15,000 troops including Afghans, Americans, Britons, Canadians, Danes and Estonians. McChrystal conveyed his apologies to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the statement said. Coalition forces have also suspended use of the HIMARS pending a review of Sunday's incident. The intended target was an insurgent compound from where coalition forces were taking direct fire, ISAF said. NATO, which launched the effort Saturday, announced the offensive before it started so that citizens could get out of harm's way. Karzai on Saturday had urged Afghan and international troops to exercise ""absolute caution"" and ensure civilian safety. Helmand is a bastion of pro-Taliban sentiment and awash with the opium used to fund the insurgency. Marjah, a region known as the heroin capital of Afghanistan, is where the Taliban has set up a shadow government. The Moshtarak operation also includes securing Kandahar and providing support to the government and police there, British Maj. Gen. Gordon Messenger said in a news release Sunday. The Taliban has had increasing influence in Kandahar. Officials said Sunday they did not know how many Taliban fighters remained in the Marjah region of Helmand province, but think they may be in the hundreds -- some of whom are holed up in civilian compounds. Taliban forces tried to overrun, successfully in some cases, several positions that coalition forces had secured inside the city, U.S. Marines told CNN. In one instance, three suspected suicide bombers breached a secure military area near Koru Chareh Bazaar, throwing three or four grenades inside the compound, Marine officials said. The insurgents were killed before they could detonate their bomb vests. The sporadic firefight continued throughout the day, with an average of two to three Taliban fighters being killed in each battle, the Marines said. ""It is not unusual for the Taliban to melt away to regroup. The threat is still present in the area that they might come back, and our troops are well aware of that,"" Messenger told CNN. ""The troops are fighting in very open terrain, especially now during the winter,"" he said. ""This is a very complex operation but it has worked extremely well."" Messenger emphasized the cooperation with the Afghan nationals as a key element in both preparing and executing this operation. ""The atmosphere among the locals remains positive, largely because elders on the ground knew about the operation ahead of time,"" he said. ""The sense is genuinely that the population is prepared to give this a go."" Provincial spokesman Dawoud Ahmadi said 27 Taliban fighters have been killed. Afghan and international force also discovered a total of 2,500 kilograms (5,500 pounds) of explosives during the operation. The Taliban spokesman for the Marjah area claimed six Taliban casualties, saying militants had killed 192 Afghan and coalition troops. In the past, the Taliban has often inflated casualty figures. ""NATO forces have not captured any areas in Marjah from the Mujahadeen,"" said Qari Yousif Ahmadi, the Taliban spokesman. Soldiers on Sunday found a weapons cache in the Nad Ali district that included two 155 mm artillery rounds, four pressure plates, blasting caps and batteries, according to ISAF. In another incident, coalition forces shot a man who refused to stop as he neared a coalition checkpoint despite repeated warnings to stop. No weapons were found on the middle-aged man, coalition forces said. Overall, Messenger said, Taliban resistance had not prevented coalition efforts to hold meetings, known as shuras, with local leaders. The coalition has been participating in these meetings to get Afghans on its side. ""There had been, and remained, very little Taliban interference. There had been small arms attacks from a distance which had tested the patrols, but nothing had stopped the mission from progressing or shuras from taking place,"" Messenger said. More on Operation Moshtarak from Afghanistan Crossroads blog . Officials said they hope Afghan forces and the government will maintain control, win allegiance from the citizens and provide farmers with an alternative to the poppy crops that pervade the region. ""Everyone understands that what has happened over the last 24-48 hours is the easy bit,"" Messenger said in a news release. ""The hard bit, the challenge, is the enduring effort, is delivering the security which allows the Afghans to start providing for their people."" CNN's Atia Abawi, Nic Robertson, Frederik Pleitgen, Barbara Starr and Per Nyberg and journalist Mati Matiullah contributed to this report.","ISAF commander apologizes after 12 civilians killed .

"LONDON (England) CNN -- Could the era of spend, spend, spend be about to end? What is the biggest personal problem ordinary people face? The answer increasingly, is debt. In the last 15 years countries such as the U.S., UK, Australia and Canada have enjoyed an economic golden age. For many consumers it seems there is no product or experience that is out of reach as long as you have a few credit cards in your wallet. It's been the era of ""because I'm worth it,"" $1,000 ""It"" handbags, celebrity worship, four credit cards apiece and vacations abroad. But a flip side is emerging from this era of excess, with potent signs in the last week that the party is coming to a close. There have been warnings signs in the U.S. this week that the economy is slowing. Rising U.S. home foreclosures and a persistent housing slump have triggered a U.S. credit crunch which has unsettled global markets and raised concerns about a possible economic slowdown. The International Monetary Fund's chief economist Simon Johnson said on Wednesday: ""We've seen a shock that has spread to other industrialized countries faster than expected. It's an important wake-up call for all of us."" On Friday the financial world was rocked when one of the biggest UK mortgage lenders Northern Rock received emergency support from the Bank of England.  According to UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, ""it's further proof that the contagion of the credit crisis is spreading through the economy."" If the U.S. housing slump, IMF warnings and Northern Rock crisis are part of the economic big picture, then it's also important to heed the calls from the coalface. What is the biggest personal problem ordinary people face? The answer increasingly, is debt. Drowning in debt . This week UK charity Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) said the number of people seeking assistance on how to manage their debts reached record levels. It is now the most common problem the advice service handles. The advice service recorded 1.7 million cases last year -- a rise of 20 percent of callers with debt-related problems. Credit card bills and other loans were 40 percent of all inquiries, while there was a ""worrying"" rise of people struggling to pay the basics such as utilities bills. The organization said the surge in calls for help was evidence that the lengthy consumer boom was taking its toll. They singled out the proliferation of debt consolidation companies for blame. Economist Andrew Charlton from the London School of Economics believes the U.S. housing slump and high levels of personal debt are part of the same problem: People on low incomes getting in over their heads with either housing stock or personal debt they cannot afford. The house of cards comes down when it is time to collect: a slight upward movement in interest rates, a drop in house prices or job losses (4,000 in the U.S. in the last month, a four-year high) means payments cannot be made and the lenders foreclose. The chickens coming home to roost . For Phillip Hodson, Fellow of the British Association for Counseling and Psychotherapy, high levels of callers distressed by debt are no surprise. ""The chickens have come home to roost. At the personal level people have to face some very difficult decisions. It's difficult to break the (credit card) habit and people whose habit is going to the mall will find it very hard,"" he said. And what habits we have: More than 4.2 million Britons have no qualms about taking their next holiday before actually paying for the last, according to statistics from UK bank Alliance & Leicester. Research from Scottish Widows shows one in three adults in the UK refuse to plan their finances at all, and those who do find the time to review them set aside just five minutes a week. Reliance on credit is a problem to be tackled not only by consumers but also governments, with our addiction to credit having a serious ripple effect on the economy. In the U.S. an increase in credit card debt again pushed up outstanding U.S. consumer debt in July by $7.5 billion, the Federal Reserve reported last Monday. Consumer credit outstanding rose to $2.46 trillion in July, up from a revised $2.45 trillion in June, the Federal Reserve said. U.S. consumers are defaulting on credit card payments at a significantly higher rate than last year, ""raising the prospect of problems in the stricken U.S. subprime mortgage market spreading to other types of consumer debt,"" according to the Financial Times this week. Credit card companies were forced to write off 4.58 percent of payments as uncollectable in the first half of 2007, almost 30 percent higher than last year. Late payments also rose, and the quarterly payment rate -- a measure of cardholders' willingness and ability to repay their debt -- fell for the first time in over four years. Simply put, we have developed a habit for credit cards that we can't afford, with people becoming adrift from old notions of delayed gratification: You save first before you purchase. Hodson told CNN about his grandmother using both sides of an envelope before she'd throw it out and keeping pieces of string that could later be reused. This World War II austerity is now folklore although some pundits say panic over the environment and resource use, as well an increase in personal debt may bring the war generation's frugal habits back into vogue. Why are we hooked on credit? Philip Hodson sees a few factors responsible for our credit binge: ""We've developed retail therapy -- it's a drug -- but it's a very fragile plant and to build an economy based on it is ridiculous."" He also says the government has encouraged a people to be reckless with money through their own bad example: ""The government must take much of the blame for encouraging a debt culture and saddling students early on with loans."" The availability of credit lines also contributes to the debt trap. In the U.S., 80 percent of households have at least one credit card. Yet that is not enough for many credit providers. Five billion credit card solicitations are mailed each year nationwide, with each cardholder owning an average of seven credit cards -- three bank credit cards and four store or gas credit cards. Average household or individual debt (or both) is about $9,300 per household holding at least one credit card. According to the advocacy group Demos, the average balance among lower- and middle-income households is $8,650. We use credit cards for computers, the latest gadgets such as iPods, holidays and fashion, all the things many of us now deem as essential. This readjustment of our needs -- perceiving that we now need more rather than the same or less also fuels our credit addiction. Economist Andrew Charlton believes our reliance on credit is symptomatic of prosperity: ""It's the by-product of the boom. In for example, Australia almost 30 percent of the population have never lived through a recession -- young people believe you can always take on debt because it's always easy to pay off. Prosperity is the cause of our credit addiction."" According to Hodson, celebrity culture has a lot to answer for: ""The credit problem is exacerbated by celebrity culture. It's the ubiquity of television -- you are taught by the electronic media to envy people's lives who are richer."" ""With celebrity culture 150 years ago your horizon would be your parish. Today anybody living on benefits can watch the plutocrats of the world having fun -- I'm not surprised they are envious."" His advise to minimize envy? ""Always compare yourself to poorer people."" The bulk of callers ringing the Citizens Advice Bureau are juggling debts but in the future Hodson thinks it will be harder to borrow money, due to the difficulty we'll have in repaying it. When lines of credit tighten or dry up, we'll have to readjust our spending habits and tastes. Luxury items will once again be out of reach for most except the super-rich. ""What's the answer to borrowing?"" asked Hodson. ""It's borrow more. But it's musical chairs and what's going to happen when you can't sit down?"" Hodson answers the question himself: ""I think a lot of people are going to be forced out of the credit economy because they can't borrow and they have a black mark against their name -- similarly if you default. Banks will start to discriminate more carefully."" As for our insatiable appetite to have the latest things and have them now: well it may be that if we can't afford them and no longer have a seemingly endless source of credit, we may have to go without. This in turn will tighten the screws on the retail industry. In UK newspaper The Independent, the ""spending squeeze"" was forecast with ""retailers reporting falling sales as debt-laden consumers tighten their belts."" Some experts believe it's not spiraling debt which will be the wake up call but the environmental costs of conspicuous consumption, while Charlton believes ""a recession will trigger a change in behavior. The next recession won't be like the last one, it will cut deeper.""  E-mail to a friend .","Global warning signs that an era of prosperity is over .

"LONDON, England  -- Almost 25,000 people will die this year of HIV/AIDS in Myanmar unless lifesaving treatment is significantly increased, according to a new report. A Doctors Without Borders worker handing out HIV/AIDS drugs in Myanmar. The study produced by leading international humanitarian organization, Doctors Without Borders said the failure by the government to provide HIV/AIDS treatment to its people is putting the population at risk. An estimated 240,000 people are thought to have HIV/AIDS in Myanmar with 76,000 of those people facing death unless they receive antiretroviral (ART) drug, the report published Tuesday said. Fewer than 20 percent of the people  are are able to access ART, according to the organization. Currently, Doctors Without Borders says it is almost the sole provider of these lifesaving drugs --providing them to more than 11,000 people. ""It is unacceptable that a single NGO is treating the vast majority of HIV patients in a crisis of this magnitude,"" the charity's Operations Manager Joe Belliveau, said in a press release. The pressure on its resources means the charity has been forced to turn away patients. ""Sometimes I wake up at midnight and dream of my patients. Women who come in are HIV positive --they have three children at home and the husband has passed away and we cannot provide any treatment for them,"" a doctor quoted in the research said. The government and international communities have provided very little to the crisis, Belliveau added. The government of Myanmar allocated just $200,000 for HIV/AIDS in 2008, which is one of the lowest amount spent worldwide, according to Doctors Without Borders. Drugs that are not provided by aid organizations or the government cost a patient $29 per month. With most people in Myanmar living on an average of $1.20 per day, the cost of drugs is unaffordable for most. The charity also appealed for intervention by the international community to avert the crisis. Myanmar currently receives around $3 per person in aid-- one of the lowest rates worldwide. One reason for this may be that international donor groups are reluctant to send aid to Myanmar, a country run by a strict military junta widely criticized for its atrocious human rights record. The report states aid agencies may be put off by challenges Myanmar imposes such as strict constraints and difficult bureaucratic procedures. Earlier this year when a deadly cyclone hit Myanmar that killed almost 100,000 people and left millions homeless, the government turned away international aid to the frustration of many organizations. Doctors Without Borders has been providing essential healthcare services in Myanmar since 1993 and began an integrated program in 2003 to support people living with HIV/AIDS.","HIV/AIDS treatment in Myanmar needs to improve drastically says a report .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Muslim family removed from an airliner Thursday after passengers became concerned about their conversation say AirTran officials refused to rebook them, even after FBI investigators cleared them of wrongdoing. A Muslim family was removed from an AirTran flight after a conversation about the safest place to sit. Atif Irfan said federal authorities removed eight members of his extended family and a friend after passengers heard them discussing the safest place to sit and misconstrued the nature of the conversation. Irfan, a U.S. citizen and tax attorney, said he was ""impressed with the professionalism"" of the FBI agents who questioned him, but said he felt mistreated when the airline refused to book the family for a later flight. AirTran Airways late Thursday said they acted properly and that the family was offered full refunds and can fly with AirTran again. ""AirTran Airways complied with all TSA, law enforcement and Homeland Security directives and had no discretion in the matter,"" the company said in a prepared statement.  Watch how Muslims find climate of fear at airport » . Family members said FBI agents tried to work it out with the airline, but to no avail. iReport.com: Share your story . ""The FBI agents actually cleared our names,"" said Inayet Sahin, Irfan's sister-in-law. ""They went on our behalf and spoke to the airlines and said, 'There is no suspicious activity here. They are clear. Please let them get on a flight so they can go on their vacation,' and they still refused."" ""The airline told us that we can't fly their airline,"" Irfan said. The dispute occurred about 1 p.m. Thursday as AirTran flight 175 was preparing for takeoff from Reagan National Airport outside of Washington, D.C., on a flight destined for Orlando, Florida. Atif Irfan, his brother, their wives, a sister and three children were headed to Orlando to meet with family and attend a religious conference. ""The conversation, as we were walking through the plane trying to find our seats, was just about where the safest place in an airplane is,"" Sahin said. ""We were (discussing whether it was safest to sit near) the wing, or the engine or the back or the front, but that's it. We didn't say anything else that would raise any suspicion.""  Watch Muslims recount how they were kicked off plane » . The conversation did not contain the words ""bomb,"" ""explosion,"" ""terror"" or other words that might have aroused suspicion, Irfan said. ""When we were talking, when we turned around, I noticed a couple of girls kind of snapped their heads,"" said Sobia Ijaz, Irfan's wife. ""I kind of thought to myself, 'Oh, you know, maybe they're going to say something.' It didn't occur to me that they were going to make it such a big issue."" Some time later, while the plane was still at the gate, an FBI agent boarded the plane and asked Irfan and his wife to leave the plane. The rest of the family was removed 15 or 20 minutes later, along with a family friend, Abdul Aziz, a Library of Congress attorney and family friend who was coincidentally taking the same flight and had been seen talking to the family. After the FBI interviewed family members, it released them, Irfan said. AirTran spokesman Tad Hutcheson said the incident began when some passengers reported hearing suspicious remarks by a woman and alerted flight attendants. Two federal air marshals, who were on board the flight, notified law enforcement about the security-related issue, AirTran said. After the family and Aziz were taken for questioning, the remaining 95 passengers were taken off of the plane and rescreened, along with the crew and the baggage, AirTran said. Irfan said he believes his family is owed an apology. ""Really, at the end of the day, we're not out here looking for money. I'm an attorney. I know how the court system works. We're basically looking for someone to say... 'We're apologizing for treating you as second-class citizens.'"" ""We are proud Americans,"" Sahin said. ""You know we decided to have our children and raise them here. We can very easily go anywhere we want in the world, but you know we love it here and we're not going to go away, no matter what."" Aziz said there is a ""very strong possibility"" he will pursue a civil rights lawsuit. ""I guess it's just a situation of guilt by association,"" Aziz said.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)  -- Five people arrested in Pakistan had been reported missing in the United States, and police are confident they were planning terrorist acts, a Pakistani police official told CNN. It is too soon to link the men with any terrorist organizations, said Tahir Gujjrar, deputy superintendent of police in Sargodha, Pakistan, but preliminary investigations suggest they had sought to link up with the Jaish-e-Mohammed and Jamaat ud Dawa militant organizations. Neither group showed interest, however, Gujjrar said. The five were from Virginia and their families had contacted the FBI soon after they went missing, he said. They include two Pakistani-Americans, two Yemeni-Americans and an Egyptian-American. The arrests came after a raid on a home in Sargodha, about 120 miles south of Islamabad, Gujjrar said. No U.S. officials have confirmed Gujjrar's information, and there was no evidence charges had been filed. The FBI had said earlier that it was trying to determine whether a link existed between the five missing men and the arrests in Pakistan. A U.S. law enforcement official not authorized to speak for attribution said the five missing men were all American citizens. Asked if they are the same men arrested in Pakistan, the official said, ""We think it is, but we don't have it firm ... The truthful answer is, we don't know."" The State Department said it does not have confirmation of the arrested individuals' identities or whether they are Americans. The U.S. embassy in Islamabad is seeking further information. If the individuals are Americans, the United States will be seeking consular access, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said. ""If they are American citizens, we are going to be very interested in the charges they have been detained on and the circumstances in which they are being held,"" he said. ""That is something we would do anywhere and that is why the embassy is seeking further information."" Under the Geneva Conventions, Pakistan is required to notify the United States about any Americans arrested, Kelly said. The U.S. law enforcement official said none of the five missing men had shown up on law enforcement's radar before they were reported missing. ""These guys never surfaced with us before."" Authorities believe their intent was to wage jihad overseas rather than with terrorist acts in the United States, the official said, but ""there is still a lot of uncertainty about what they were up to."" A Pakistani official said the men arrived in Karachi on November 30 and went on to Lahore and then Sargodha, where they were arrested Wednesday, the official said. The arrests came at the behest of local police. Preliminary investigations are ongoing, the official said. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said in a statement Wednesday it was assisting in the investigation of ""five Muslim young men from Virginia who left the country recently under mysterious circumstances."" The parents of the missing youths and local Muslim leaders approached the council about the disappearances and the organization ""immediately informed the FBI,"" the council said. Council spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said one of the missing youths was a student at Howard University, and all five knew each other. One of the youths left a video behind, Nihad Awad, the council's executive director, told reporters. ""I was disturbed by the content of it,"" he said. One person appeared in it, and made references to ""the ongoing conflict in the world, and that young Muslims have to do something,"" Awad said. He said the video ""juxtaposed certain verses of the Quran,"" and he suggested there was a misunderstanding of those verses and their potential misuse. The video is about 11 minutes long, he said, and is ""like a farewell."" Awad said it did not specify what the youths would be doing, but he has seen similar videos on the Internet, and ""it just made me uncomfortable."" One source identified the missing Howard student as Ramy Zamzam, who was studying dentistry at the Washington college. No further details were immediately available, and it was not immediately known whether he was among those arrested in Pakistan. The council and the Muslim community realize there is a problem, although it is not widespread, Awad said, and is ""going to launch a major campaign of education to refute the misuse of verses in the Quran, or the misuse of certain grievances in the Muslim world. We believe that we can do a lot to reinstate confidence in young American Muslims, that they have to be fully engaged, as the majority of them are engaged in civic life and in the political process."" He and other Muslim officials cautioned against a rush to judgment against the youths, and praised their families and members of the Muslim community for approaching law enforcement and assisting in the investigation. At the end of November, he said, the youths told their parents they were attending a local conference, but their parents became suspicious when calling their cell phones because they got what sounded like an overseas ring tone. The families then went to the council. ""The main concern was to get them back and figure out what was going on and protect any national security and everybody's rights,"" Hooper said. He said he understood the five left the country in a couple of groups at the end of November. Along with the families and Muslim community leaders, the council said it was working to assist investigators. Imam Johari Abdul-Malik of the Coordinating Council of Muslim Organizations in the Washington area, said that while the five were active in their mosques, ""From all of our interviews, there's been no sign that they were in any way outwardly radicalized ... there haven't been any reports that there was anything outwardly suspicious in their behavior."" The FBI is aware of the arrests, and is also investigating a report of five people reported missing from the Washington area, said Katherine Schweit, spokeswoman for the agency's Washington field office. ""We are working with Pakistan authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there"" -- if the people arrested are the people who are missing, she said. She declined to elaborate, citing an ongoing investigation. U.S. authorities have been wary of Islamic militants recruiting young Muslims from the United States to fight overseas. Prosecutors in Minnesota recently arrested eight Somali-American men on charges related to what they said were efforts to recruit youths from the Minneapolis area to fight for al-Shabaab, a Somali guerrilla movement battling the African country's U.N.-backed transitional government. At least two young men from Minnesota have been killed in Somalia, including one who blew himself up in what is believed to have been the first suicide bombing carried out by a naturalized U.S. citizen. The matter has ""always been a concern,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday. ""We have been well aware of the threats that we continue to face along with friends and allies around the world ... we know that we have to work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."" CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: One source identified the missing Howard student as Ramy Zamzam .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has again indefinitely blocked plans to disseminate video of an important federal court case involving same-sex marriage in California. The justices in an unsigned order Wednesday prevented any distribution of the live video stream outside the San Francisco, California, courthouse where the case is being heard, and any real-time or delayed posting on the Internet. In a trial that began Monday, a federal judge in San Francisco will decide whether the state's Proposition 8 banning same-sex marriage is constitutional. California voters approved the measure in November 2008, prompting an appeal by several homosexual couples. As part of a pilot program, the judge had agreed to allow video of the trial to be sent live to other rooms within the courthouse and to five other federal courthouses, and to be posted several hours later on the popular video site YouTube.com. Opponents of same-sex marriage had asked the Supreme Court to intervene, saying witness testimony could be affected if cameras were present. It is extremely rare for a federal trial to be televised to the broader public. The Supreme Court's latest order allows distribution only to designated ""overflow"" rooms in the San Francisco courthouse, where people who want to view the trial but are unable to fit into the courtroom can watch the proceedings on closed-circuit television. A majority of Supreme Court justices concluded expanded broadcast should not permitted because, they wrote, ""It appears the courts below did not follow the appropriate procedures set forth in federal law before changing their rules to allow such broadcasting."" There has been much internal debate in federal courts around the country about the televised experiment, with several judges and administrators privately expressing concern that it could eventually lead to the entire judiciary being televised, including the Supreme Court. In dissent to the ruling, Justice Stephen Breyer and three liberal colleagues complained the public would be deprived of watching ""a nonjury civil case of great public interest to five other federal courthouses located in Seattle [Washington], Pasadena [California], Portland [Oregon], San Francisco [California], and Brooklyn [New York]."" He was supported by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens and Sonia Sotomayor. Breyer said the Supreme Court traditionally has stayed out of what he called another court's administrative discretion on such matters, saying, ""I believe this court should adhere to its institutional competence, its historical practice, and its governing precedent -- all of which counsel against the issuance of this stay."" The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry (09A648).","Lower court had OK'd posting videos of trial on Internet .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Violent crime in the United States declined in 2008, due in part to a significant drop in the number of murders, according to the first available FBI figures covering the entire year. The decline would be the third straight year-to-year drop in violent crime in the United States. The preliminary figures for 2008, released Monday, show that overall reported crime dropped 2.5 percent nationally from the previous year, including a 4.4 percent decline in murders. Although crime statistics varied sharply from city to city, the overall number of reported murders declined 9.1 percent in cities with populations of 100,000 to 250,000. However, murders increased 5.5 percent in towns of fewer than 10,000 residents. Overall, the number of aggravated assaults declined 3.2 percent, forcible rape decreased 2.2 percent, and robbery decreased 1.1 percent. The Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report historically provides a strong indication of the final figures that will be compiled and released later in the year. The statistics are based on a compilation of crime reports provided to the FBI by the more than 12,000 law enforcement agencies in the nation. The report shows a small increase in violent crime in the second half of the year. Figures for the first half of 2008, which were released in early January, showed that overall violent crime through the end of June had declined 3.5 percent, compared with the 2.5 percent decline for the entire year. Other results in the year-end figures were a 1.6 percent drop in reported property crimes from 2007, including a 13.1 percent decline in motor vehicle thefts. Violent crime in the United States has largely been on the decline over the past two decades. In 2005, however, a surprising increase prompted headlines of an end to the drop in violence. Monday's figures show that the downward trend has resumed. After the 2005 violent crime increase of 2.3 percent, the figures increased only 1.9 percent in 2006 and then dropped 0.7 percent in 2007 before the decline of 2.5 percent in the preliminary 2008 figures.","Preliminary data: U.S. violent crime in 2008 dropped 2.5 percent from 2007 .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The American missionaries in Haiti facing kidnapping charges for trying to take 33 children out of the country last week made an earlier, unsuccessful attempt at taking dozens of other children, a Haitian police officer said. The officer did not want to be identified for fear of reprisals. He told CNN on Monday that he had stopped the 10 Baptist missionaries, including group leader Laura Silsby, on January 26 as they tried to transport 40 children from Haiti to the Dominican Republic. The officer said he discovered Silsby and the nine other Americans on a bus in Port-au-Prince's Pétionville neighborhood after receiving a tip from a concerned citizen. He stopped the group and ordered the children to get off the bus. He then directed Silsby to the Dominican Embassy. ""I said what happened, and she [Silsby] told me, 'I have the paperwork to cross the Haitian-Dominican border with 100 children,' "" the officer said. A former attorney for the group, Edwin Coq, said the officer has testified of his account. Prosecutors questioned the officer last week in the case against the missionaries. Prosecutors no longer suspect him of any wrongdoing, and he is now a witness, according Coq, who is familiar with the prosecution's case file. The police officer's superiors also confirmed his version of events. Attorneys for the Americans did not immediately answer calls for comment. Full coverage of the earthquake's aftermath . The 10 missionaries were charged Thursday with kidnapping children and criminal association for trying to take 33 children out of Haiti. Earlier Monday, Jorge Puello, a Dominican attorney who said he was hired to represent the group, said they had authorization from the Dominican Republic to bring the children across the border. Puello showed reporters a manila folder he said contained documents that prove the Americans had authorization to bring the children into the Dominican Republic, but he did not show the documents to reporters. Dominican authorities have said the Americans did not have permission, and Puello did not say whether the group had the authorization of Haitian officials. The Americans have said they were trying to help the children get to a safe place after January 12's magnitude-7.0 earthquake, which has left more than 200,000 dead. iReport: Looking for loved ones in Haiti . Arriving outside the Haitian attorney general's office Monday, Puello said a church hired him that counts some of the jailed Americans among its members. He did not identify the congregation. Coq announced over the weekend that he had resigned. Puello said Monday that Coq had been fired but gave no details. Some of the Americans have said they thought they were helping orphans, but their interpreters said this week that they were present when group members spoke with some of the children's parents. Some parents in a village outside Port-au-Prince said they had willingly given their children to the Americans, who promised them a better life. The parents also said they had been told they could see their children whenever they wanted. But the Dominican consul general has said he warned the group's leader, Silsby, about trying to cross the border without proper documents. Silsby and four other Americans arrived for an appearance before an examining judge Monday. One of them, Paul Thomson, referred reporters to a passage in the New Testament book of 1 Corinthians, in which the apostle Paul tells early Christians, ""It seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to die in the arena."" The passage continues, ""To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless. We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it; when we are slandered, we answer kindly.""","Ten Americans in Haiti charged with kidnapping 33 Haitian children .

"(CNN)  -- He burst on the music scene in the 1970s with the Commodores and then went on to a major solo career with hits such as ""All Night Long"" and ""Hello."" Lionel Richie and his daughter, Nicole, gave their first joint TV interview in six years to CNN's Larry King. She made a name for herself on the TV series ""The Simple Life,"" which followed the exploits of her and fellow socialite Paris Hilton, and in the tabloids. Father-and-daughter Lionel and Nicole Richie have been making news for decades, but rarely together. In their first TV interview together in six years, they talked with CNN's Larry King about their relationship; her time in rehab; Lionel's first grandchild, Harlow; their growing family; and more. The following interview, scheduled to air Thursday night, has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: You did ""American Idol."" A European tour. A new CD. You ever give thoughts of just cooling it? Lionel Richie: My answer to that is very simple. I don't like fishing. I'm pretty much like you. This is my hobby. King: What's the new album [""Just Go""] about? Lionel Richie: You know what I decided to do on this album? Something different. Instead of controlling, which is what I love to do -- I'm the writer, I'm the arranger, I'm the producer, I'm the singer -- I decided [to] start another way. I just gave up the power completely. There is only one song on this album that I actually wrote, called ""Eternity."" King: The ""American Idol"" thing. Was that fun? Why did you do it? Lionel Richie: It's the best fun in the world. Danny [Gokey] was so wonderful. He kept saying, ""Suppose I mess up or suppose I sing your line instead of my line,"" and I said, ""You can't mess this one up. And if you feel like you want to sing my part, sing it loud and strong."" And of course he nailed it. It was so much fun to watch everybody backstage. The tension of what goes through that show, I don't think I [could] do it. [Nicole Richie joins the interview] . King: What is it like to be with her in this setting? Lionel Richie: I'm so proud of her right now. There is such a pride that she has turned this corner. She is an amazing mother. I want the world to know where she is. King: Now you're pregnant with a second child, right? Nicole Richie: Yes, yes I am. King: And the father [Joel Madden] is the same? Nicole Richie: Yes. King: You going to get married? Nicole Richie: Eventually, yes. King: But that's not important or paramount? Nicole Richie: I think for both of us, we are going to do it because we want to, not because that's what you do. King: What kind of grandfather is he? Nicole Richie: Well, he's very animated. He smiles like this all the time, and so he's nothing but fun for Harlow. She absolutely loves him.  Watch Nicole Richie talk about her daughter » . King: Nicole, you've been through some turbulent times. You've had drug abuse, wild-child behavior. Entered rehab in 2003. How have you come through all of that? Nicole Richie: With the support of my family, really. I've always stayed really close with my mother [Brenda] and my father. I have really great friends. And I just have a really great circle around me who support me no matter what, don't judge me no matter how low I've ever gotten. King: How did you deal with it, Lionel? Lionel Richie: It gave me an amazing opportunity to step up to the plate. I said to her one day: I have some good news and I have some bad news. I said the bad news is that Nicole is going to die. The good news is, she doesn't have to. I remember that look on her face of sheer panic. And I said the only person who is going to be able to save Nicole is Nicole. And she went away and about three weeks later I got a phone saying, 'Dad, I want to go into rehab.' And when she checked into rehab, her mother and I checked into rehab with her. King: What was the toughest part about rehab? Nicole Richie: It was right before ""The Simple Life"" came out. Just the fact that I couldn't do it in private really was unfortunate. But we didn't watch TV there or [had no] connection to the outside world, which I thought was really great. So I just focused on being positive there and focused on myself. And my parents were there with me. They came for family week. And so I just focused on that and everything just kind of fell in place.  Watch Nicole Richie talk about rehab » . King: When all of those troubles were going on, didn't it affect [your] performance? Lionel Richie: Thank God for the stage. What the stage was for me was an outlet. It gave me a chance to kind of get away from it for a moment. King: You said that you were not a good dad to Nicole growing up ... wasn't there for her. Do you regret that? Lionel Richie: I was trying to be Lionel Richie. There is a part of [me] that's guilty because I wish I could have been there more for her, but I was trying to make it as the solo guy at that time. King: What kind of dad was he? Nicole Richie: I really hate when he says that. I hate when he says that he wasn't a good dad because my memory of my childhood was nothing but good memories. I remember him coming down in the kitchen in the morning and singing songs and us playing. Was he gone a lot? Yeah. But he also toured a lot. Even when he and my mom divorced, it was kind of like he was on tour, so I was kind of OK with it. And he's not perfect, he's a human and we went through phases of not speaking. I could sit here and I could say that I was a terrible daughter, too, but I am not going to say that. King: How do you like her boyfriend [Joel Madden]? Lionel Richie: Love him. Love him. King: Don't you want them to get married? Lionel Richie: I want them to take their time. I'm more interested in whether they like each other and whether they're best friends. Because that means they'll be great parents forever. King [to Nicole]: You were adopted. Nicole Richie: Yes. Lionel Richie: When we adopted, [she] was 8, yes. When we first met her, she was 3 1/2. King: Took five years? Lionel Richie: She stayed with us for two years before we even thought about legal guardianship. King: Was there a doubt about doing it? Lionel Richie: It was a tremendous responsibility, but I fell in love. Brenda fell in love. And once you fall in love, you don't know anything else.","Lionel Richie likes father of his grandchild; says Nicole shouldn't rush marriage .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States Mint launched a new coin Tuesday featuring jazz legend Duke Ellington, making him the first African-American to appear by himself on a circulating U.S. coin. The District of Columbia coin honoring Duke Ellington was introduced Tuesday in Washington. Ellington, the composer of classics including ""It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing"" appears on the ""tails"" side of the new D.C. quarter. George Washington is on the ""heads"" side, as is usual with U.S. quarters. The coin was issued to celebrate Ellington's birthplace, the District of Columbia. U.S. Mint Director Ed Moy introduced the new coin at a news conference Tuesday at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History. Members of Ellington's family were present at the ceremony, and the jazz band of Duke Ellington High School performed. Ellington won the honor by a vote of D.C. residents, beating out abolitionist Frederick Douglass and astronomer Benjamin Banneker. Also on the coin is the phrase ""Justice for all."" The Mint rejected the first inscription choice of D.C. voters, which was ""taxation without representation,"" in protest of the district's lack of voting representation in Congress. Edward Kennedy ""Duke"" Ellington received 13 Grammy Awards and a Pulitzer Prize, among numerous other honors. His orchestra's theme song, ""Take the A Train,"" is one of the best-known compositions in jazz. Ellington was born in the district in 1899 and composed more than 3,000 songs, including ""Satin Doll,"" ""Perdido"" and ""Don't Get Around Much Any More."" ""It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing"" helped usher in the swing era of jazz. Ellington performed with other famous artists, including John Coltrane, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, and he traveled around the world with his orchestras. He died in 1974 at the age of 75. The first African-American to appear on a circulating coin was York, a slave who accompanied Lewis and Clark on their ""Corps of Discovery"" adventures across America at the dawn of the 19th century. The 2003 Missouri quarter features the three men together in a canoe on the obverse. The U.S. Mint distinguishes between circulating coins, which are intended for daily use, and commemorative ones, which mark special occasions. African-Americans including Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball's color barrier, have appeared on commemorative coins. Educator Booker T. Washington, botanist George Washington Carver and the first Revolutionary War casualty, Crispus Attucks, all of whom were black, have also appeared on commemorative coins, according to the U.S. Mint.","Duke Ellington featured on reverse of new quarter honoring District of Columbia .

"(CNN) -- Mike and Missy Wilson sat in a meeting late Tuesday afternoon, planning a ministry trip to Haiti when they were interrupted by a text message. A co-worker read the news: a powerful earthquake had just struck the Caribbean country. In their Nashville, Tennessee, office, Mike Wilson said, ""My heart just dropped"" as he listened to the one-line bulletin. The quake's epicenter was a few miles from an orphanage in Carrefour, Haiti, where the Wilsons' 21-year-old daughter Katie was working, and the 5-year-old girl they were about to adopt lived. ""I felt like I couldn't take another breath,"" Missy Wilson said, ""I jumped up and yelled, 'This can't be happening.'"" The first bits of news were discouraging, as sketchy reports came in of buildings collapsing and widespread destruction. ""It was horrible,"" Missy Wilson said. ""We spent hours trying to get any information."" The Brent Gambrell Ministries where she is director frequently works with churches and groups in Haiti. Any phone number they had in the country was quickly written on a board in the office. ""A group of 20 (people) sat and dialed the numbers over and over and over again."" ""There are no words to explain that two people I love dearly were in the middle, and I couldn't reach then,"" Mike Wilson said, his voice cracking. But it was more than 24 hours before they finally got word. A brief, scratchy call from their daughter Katie came through -- she and 5-year-old Tia had survived the quake that destroyed the orphanage. Missy Wilson said Katie was able to say, ""I'm alive. We're safe. Tia's safe. Please just know we're alive,"" before the 40-second call was cut off. It would be Thursday before the Wilsons learned the whole story. Mike Wilson, with two ministry officials, was able to travel into Haiti on a medivac plane, and the three made their way to the town. ""There was destruction all around,"" he said from Haiti, ""When I saw what was left of that building, I knew they were protected."" Katie, Tia and 47 other children all made it out, but were living in the parking lot across from the shattered orphanage. When Mike Wilson finally found his daughter, she ran up to him at full speed and hugged him. ""I can totally see her knocking him to the ground,"" her mother said. The first order of business: a call home to a nervous mom. Wilson was able to get through on a rare working cell phone, and told his wife, ""need to you to hear something."" Missy Wilson said the next words were from Tia, barely able to speak English, saying, ""'Ma-ma, I love you.' I started screaming at the top of my lungs."" Wilson and his colleagues brought food, water and supplies to the 200 quake victims in the parking lot. He described the injured, including one with a broken leg, being treated for two days in the heat with nothing more than an aspirin. The group arranged a bus to take the children to a guest house, a trip delayed when the bus broke down. But that news was minor, knowing they would have shelter and supplies. For the Wilsons, the next struggle is how to bring Tia home. They had been in Haiti just last week finishing paperwork for the adoption, but the office handling the case was destroyed in the quake. ""All that paperwork, God knows where it is,"" Mike Wilson said. ""That building was five stories, now it's five feet tall."" For Missy, waiting for news at home, ""I feel like I'm floating on top of my body."" ""Like I'm living a dream and waiting to wake up,"" she said. This week has gone ""from hopelessness to hope to tears to 'I can't take another phone call because I don't know what will happen,'"" she said. Wilson said he is working with the U.S. Embassy seeking emergency help to bring Tia to Nashville. ""We are going to do it,"" he said, his voice the strongest it had been all day.","Wilsons' 21-year-old daughter, and the 5-year-old girl they were about to adopt live in Haiti .

"Chicago, Illinois (CNN) -- A body found Monday in the Chicago River is that of Michael Scott, president of the Chicago Board of Education, police said. A medical examiner has ruled Scott's death a suicide, Police Superintendent Jody Weis said, but authorities have not completed their investigation. There was a gunshot wound to the head, police said. Scott's family had reported him missing about midnight, and his body was found about 3:20 a.m., Weis said. He was last seen about 6:30 p.m. Sunday, Weis said, but he would not disclose where, saying that may be part of the investigation. Scott's wife told police that it was ""very unusual"" for him not to be home by midnight, Weis said. The gunshot entrance wound was on the left side of his head, police said. A weapon was found either under or alongside his body, Weis said, and Scott's car was in the immediate area. The police investigation will include ballistics evidence and analysis of surveillance cameras in the area, Weis said. It is too early for police to draw conclusions, he added. ""Mr. Scott was a strong advocate for education,"" Cook County Board President Todd Stroger said in a written statement. ""His contributions to the minority communities of Cook County will be sorely missed, in particular, his love for the upward mobility of residents from Chicago's West Side, where he spent his life."" In Washington, U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan also mourned Scott's death, saying he was ""shocked and saddened by the sudden death"" of his ""friend and colleague. ""Michael cared passionately about public education and made many courageous decisions as president of the board. He gave his time, energy and talents to improving the life chances of children. ""Chicago has lost a great leader, and the city's school children have lost a devoted champion."" Duncan was the chief executive officer of the Chicago school system from 2001 to 2008. The Rev. Jesse Jackson recalled first meeting Scott about 30 years ago. ""We're just stunned and shocked,"" he said. ""Michael was so effervescent, so full of life."" Scott had been appointed to the Chicago Board of Education three times, twice as president. He most recently was appointed in February. Previously, Scott was board president for five years, until July 2006. Scott disclosed in early August that he had been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury investigating how students were chosen for admission to some of Chicago's most elite public schools. He denied using his influence during two stints as board president to help any student into a selective-enrollment school. Scott, who was a developer, also was criticized in August when it was revealed that he had quietly arranged to develop city-owned land near a park that would have been used in the 2016 Summer Games. The move would have positioned Scott to cash in, had Chicago been awarded the Olympics. The 2016 Games were awarded to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

"(WIRED) -- Apple has traditionally held its ground as a premium computer manufacturer, but it might just be getting sucked into a recession-prompted price war. A worker helps a customer with a MacBook Pro laptop at an Apple store in San Francisco, California. The company's recent MacBook price cuts signify its reluctant conformity to the economic downturn. At its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, Apple shaved hundreds of dollars off its MacBook models. The high-end, 15-inch MacBook Pros dropped from $2,000 to $1,700. And the price of the unibody MacBook (now renamed the 13-inch MacBook Pro) fell from $1,300 to $1,200. Apple's most inexpensive MacBook, the lone white model, remains $1,000. ""For a while they've been ignoring what's been happening in the economy,"" said Richard Shim, an IDC analyst. ""This is an indication that they're realizing that the first quarter didn't go as well as it has for them historically. I think this puts them closer in mind about what's going on in the PC world."" Still, Apple has avoided making even deeper price cuts, thanks to the juicy profit margins already baked into its products, the availability of cheap components, and the fact that the company also makes money by selling apps and music to iPhone and iPod owners. All of these factors mean that Apple has room to comfortably trim prices even further, if it deems it necessary. For instance, the company dropped the price of its now low-end smartphone, the iPhone 3G, to just $100 with a two-year contract. But that cut doesn't cost Apple as much as it might appear, given that the company still gets a carrier subsidy of several hundred dollars for each iPhone. Apple's computers have historically been priced well above the average PC. However, Apple's first quarter of 2009 market-share numbers suggest the company is struggling to compete as a premium brand name in the face of the economic recession. In the first quarter of 2009, Apple's U.S. notebook market share shrank 0.4 percent compared to the same quarter a year earlier, according to Shim. And in worldwide notebook market share, the company saw 0.3 percent growth compared to the first quarter of 2008, Shim said. Additionally, Apple is likely hurting from its competitors' aggressive pricing, cast into relief by Microsoft's recent Laptop Hunters ad campaign, a BrandIndex survey indicates. The pseudo reality-TV commercials denounce Apple computers as too expensive and even implies Mac users are simple-minded snobs who buy gadgets as a fashion statement. As a result, Microsoft is detracting from Apple's ""value"" score by convincing a substantial number of consumers that they get less for their money by buying a Mac, according to the survey. By cutting its prices somewhat, Apple may also be seizing the opportunity to strike a blow against the netbook market. In 2008, low-powered, budget netbook PCs saw rapid growth, driven by value-conscious consumers looking for a good deal. Apple has no netbook in its lineup, and has said it has no plans to create a netbook. Fortunately for Apple, netbook sales are seeing a significant slowdown in 2009. In April, netbook manufacturers Acer, Asus and Micro Star International each reported fewer netbooks were sold than expected. Their netbook shipments for the first quarter of 2009 fell considerably below shipments during the third quarter of 2008. Asus, for example, hoped to ship 1 million Asus Eee PC systems during the first quarter, but only 900,000 units sold. Thus, Apple's MacBook price cuts are a strategic move to reclaim growth while the netbook market is shrinking. This move allows Apple to continue to avoid offering a netbook, which is wise, because an Apple netbook would have cannibalized MacBook sales, according to ThinkPanmure analyst Vijay Rakesh. With the reduced MacBook price tags, Rakesh expects Apple to see double-digit growth in notebook marketshare -- up to 20 percent -- in the third quarter of 2009. Regardless, Apple's MacBook price tags are still well above the cost of the average notebook -- $860 in the United States, according to Shim. Apple's cheapest MacBook is anchored at $1,000, and Apple could afford to bring it down even lower if it so chose. According to Tim Bajarin, principal analyst with Creative Strategies, Apple's new pricing for its MacBook line and the price drop on its lightweight MacBook Air will not compromise much on its profit margins. ""They are not favoring market share over profitability in a big way,"" Bajarin explained. ""They have already taken the pricing curve down on the unibody and chipsets, so they are building on those lower costs."" Will Apple deliver a mobile computer for the average Joe in terms of cost? Perhaps so, in the form of a touchscreen tablet that many Apple enthusiasts are placing their bets on. Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster predicts such a device -- a blown-up iPod Touch, of sorts -- will land as soon as 2010. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"Woodbridge, Virginia (CNN)  -- The police photograph is chilling. In grainy black and white tones, it shows 13-year-old Martin Andrews sitting in a makeshift box, his leg chained. The look in his eyes is one of fear, fatigue and disbelief. He had just been rescued from a nightmare. ""I was abducted by a sexually violent predator by the name of Richard Ausley, who had been twice convicted for sexually assaulting young boys, and he had taken me for eight days,"" Andrews recalled of his ordeal 37 years ago this month. ""I was left to die."" As a survivor of a sex crime, Andrews is one face of an issue the Supreme Court will revisit Tuesday: civil commitment, which allows the government to keep sex offenders in custody even after they have served their sentences. Twenty states have such laws, including Virginia, where Andrews was held captive and repeatedly assaulted. CNN normally doesn't name victims of sex crimes, but Andrews, now a victims' advocate, agreed to tell his story. On the other side of the debate is the first sex offender released from Virginia's civil commitment program, and one of just a handful nationwide. ""I served my time for what I did, and I didn't feel like I should be incarcerated again,"" said this man, who asked that his identity not be revealed for fear of retribution. ""It was a scary thing to know that you could be committed to a mental institution for the rest of your life."" The man said mandatory therapy helped him, but he thinks that could have been initiated while he was in prison. There is widespread disagreement on whether civil commitment is a Catch-22. In discussions of the effects of sex crimes, nothing is simple or dispassionate. The practice of confinement in mental hospitals or treatment centers for those with severe mental illness has been around the United States since its founding. Around the turn of the 20th century, many laws dealing with sexual psychopaths were passed. Over the decades, the laws were repealed or rarely applied. Then, in 1990, Washington state became the first to pass an innovative civil commitment law specifically for violent sex offenders. California, Wisconsin and New York, among others, later followed. Such ""predator laws"" focused on risk assessment and prevention of re-offending. It is a concept that the general public may not be aware exists. The Supreme Court has upheld the use of such laws when the individual goal is rehabilitation, not further ""punishment."" But it has another, broader purpose. ""The primary goal is incapacitation, that is, protecting society from people who are predicted to be dangerous in the future,"" said Eric Janus, author of ""Failure to Protect"" and dean at William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota. ""The second goal is to provide treatment to these individuals."" Critics of these programs say behavioral rehabilitation centers amount to prisons, are often overcrowded and understaffed, and rarely meet the stated goal of treating the ""worst of the worst"" offenders to the point they can rejoin society. ""The evidence is showing that it's only becoming a detainment center for people they do not went on the streets,"" said Derek Logue, a sex offender who was released and now advocates for offender rights through his Web site, oncefallen.com. ""They have no hope of getting out, and the odds are stacked against you."" According to Justice Department statistics, 20 states use civil confinement, involving about 4,000 rapists, pedophiles and other sex offenders nationwide. Estimates are that these programs cost taxpayers more than $700 million a year, almost $150,000 per individual. That is about four times more than confining them in prison. Virginia passed its civil commitment law in 1999 but had never fully funded it. Andrews found out from a reporter in 2002 that his attacker was just weeks away from being released after 29 years behind bars. Once a victim, now an empowered advocate, Andrews realized he had to act. ""I didn't know about other sex offenders. I didn't know about the extent of the problem. I only knew one, but I knew that one needed to be dealt with,"" Andrews, 50, said from his northern Virginia home, where he works as a program manger for a defense contractor. State officials, he said, ""all told me there was nothing to be done; he was going to be set free; that was it."" But Andrews mobilized, lobbying lawmakers to quickly fund the program, despite a budget shortfall. It worked, and the state has become a national model, using a tool called ""Static 99"" that assesses which offenders qualify for civil commitment. Andrews' attacker remained behind bars but was killed by a fellow inmate before ever going into the treatment program. The catalyst for the state's change were once-dormant memories for Andrews, who now knew that he had to tell his story. As a teenager in Portsmouth in 1973, Andrews was walking to the store in snowy weather when a van pulled up and the man inside asked the boy whether he wanted to earn some extra money moving furniture. Andrews agreed but instead was taken to a rural area and a metal box dug into the side of a hill. ""He looked at me, and he said, 'I've got bad news for you. You've just been kidnapped.' "" What followed was days of brutal rapes and beatings. Ausley eventually left, and Andrews would certainly have died if some rabbit hunters had not stumbled upon him after hearing his screams. Andrews believes that civil commitment is not the best tool, but for the most dangerous predators, ""it is the only tool we have that is 100 percent effective, because they are removed from society. They are removed from their triggers."" The case before the Supreme Court on Tuesday deals with a federal law that has kept as many as 77 inmates held in federal prison in North Carolina under indefinite commitment. The justices will decide whether the program enacted under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 is constitutional by infringing on a traditional state function. The law was named after the son of ""America's Most Wanted"" host John Walsh. The justices said in 2007 that a Kansas law was neither double jeopardy (second criminal punishment for the same crime) nor ""ex post facto"" (new punishment for a previous crime). ""We have never held that the Constitution prevents a state from civilly detaining those for whom no treatment is available but who nevertheless pose a danger to others,"" Justice Clarence Thomas said. Courts have since been at odds with what kind of treatment must be provided and to what extent, to pass constitutional muster. Janus worries about the slippery slope if such laws -- federal or state -- are allowed to continue without strong judicial checks. ""The main danger of civil commitment of sex offenders is that it provides a precedent for doing an end run around those governmental protections, and we all may be comfortable right now because we say, 'Well, this is those people. It's not us. It's not our rights that are at stake,' "" he said. ""I think we all ought to be cognizant of the fact that these laws set a precedent that greatly expands the power of government to take away our liberty, not for something we've done in the past, not after we've been convicted and punished, but out of fear that we might commit a crime in the future, and this is a very very powerful and dangerous idea,"" Janus said. The white-haired man sitting with his lawyer outside Richmond says he is no longer a danger to society. He served nearly eight years in prison for molesting three girls and nearly five years in forced civil commitment. Despite that state confinement, including being the first of only about four men to be released from it, he says post-prison treatment helped him. ""I think that civil commitment is unfair,"" he said. ""I'm not against treatment. I have done everything in my power to help myself"" understand the effects of sexual abuse. He said that being told just days before his scheduled 2003 release that he was being civilly committed left him feeling ""hopeless."" Shortly afterward, the man castrated himself with a razor in his jail cell. After the transfer and years in the rehabilitation unit, he was freed and lives a quiet life -- albeit under constant electronic surveillance -- with no further reported incidents, says his attorney. Lawyer David Hargett convinced the Virginia Supreme Court that his client had a constitutional right to contest his civil commitment. ""I have found talking with people they are shocked to hear somebody can be sentenced by a judge, serve out that entire sentence and then say, 'Wait a minute, we're not going to let you go,' "" Hargett said, calling it a legal ""black hole."" ""This treatment facility ... is a prison, let's be honest. It has barbed wire and locked doors."" He said most in the Virginia facility realistically will never get out. The high court case is U.S. v. Comstock (08-1224).","Case on civil commitment laws comes before U.S. Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- North Korea on Monday proposed replacing the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War with a formal peace treaty, a step it said would pave the way for breaking the international impasse over its nuclear program. But the communist state said international sanctions imposed after a series of nuclear weapons and missile tests should be lifted before it returns to the negotiating table, a suggestion the United States quickly dismissed. The cease-fire that ended the three-year Korean War never led to a permanent peace treaty, leaving the North Korean-South Korean border the world's most heavily militarized frontier. In a statement carried by the official news agency KCNA, North Korea said that a final settlement of the conflict is ""essential"" to talks aimed at persuading it to dismantle its nuclear program. ""When the parties are in the state of war where they level guns at each other, distrust in the other party can never be wiped out, and the talks themselves can never make smooth progress, much less realizing the denuclearization,"" it said. ""Without settling such [an] essential and fundamental issue as war and peace, no agreement can escape from frustration and failure as now."" Pyongyang has refused to return to the talks, which also involve the United States, Russia, China, South Korea and Japan, insisting that it wants to talk directly with the U.S. government. But Washington says it will not lift sanctions or normalize relations with the North until it takes irreversible steps toward dismantling its nuclear program. ""We're not going to pay North Korea for coming back to the six-party process,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Monday.","Armistice ended Korean War in 1953; North suggests replacing with treaty .

"(CNN) -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon will return to Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, for the second time in as many weeks on Wednesday morning, a spokesman for the municipal police department said. ""For security reasons, details are nonexistent,"" police department spokesman Jacinto Seguro said. Calderon will attend a meeting with local, state and federal officials, as well as civic and human rights groups, on Wednesday in Ciudad Juarez, which has been plagued by violence stemming from drug cartels. The January 31 killings in southern Juarez of 15 people, most of whom were students with no ties to organized crime, has sparked outrage across the country. The slayings, which occurred at a house party, are thought to be the result of bad intelligence by a cartel and the gang that carried out the killings. President Calderon, who has faced mounting pressure this month from Juarez residents to resign, will be visiting the city for the third time since assuming power in December 2006. Last week in Juarez, Calderon apologized to the families of the 15 people killed and promised residents that their input would form part of the strategy against drug-related violence. Residents of Juarez attempting to highlight the growing frustration with Calderon's war against organized crime took to the streets by the hundreds on Saturday. Many held signs targeted at Calderon reading, ""Assassin."" On Tuesday, police said a business owner and his 24-year-old secretary were found slain inside a business near southern Juarez at 11 a.m. ""It's not new that the cartels target business owners, but killing his secretary, that's something that you don't see too often,"" Seguro said. Also Tuesday, 20 students found skipping class and drinking in the street were detained by police as part of an effort to curtail unlawful street activity, Seguro said. Violence in Juarez comes amid a backdrop of vastly increased numbers of homicides nationwide, as drug cartels battle each other and the Mexican government steps up its efforts to combat them.

"(CNN)  -- Golfer Tiger Woods will ""apologize for his behavior"" Friday when he makes a statement at PGA headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, his agent said. Agent Mark Steinberg said Woods would not answer questions. It will be the golfer's first public appearance since his November 27 car crash outside his home near Orlando, Florida. ""Tiger Woods will be speaking to a small group of friends, colleagues and close associates,"" Steinberg said. "" ... Tiger plans to discuss his past and his future and he intends to apologize for his behavior."" A statement on Woods' Web site elaborated: ""While Tiger feels that what happened is fundamentally a matter between him and his wife, he also recognizes that he has hurt and let down a lot of other people who were close to him. He also let down his fans. He wants to begin the process of making amends, and that's what he's going to discuss."" Blog: No apologies Tiger, just be real . Steinberg said he didn't know if Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren, would appear with her husband. Woods crashed his black Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and then a tree just a few days after the National Enquirer reported he was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess who denied the affair. A day after he paid his $164 traffic ticket, Woods' seemingly perfect world began to crumble under what would eventually become an avalanche of allegations of infidelity threatening his five-year marriage to Nordegren. The couple have two children, Charlie, 1, and Sam, 2. Woods issued an apology for ""transgressions"" that had let his family down, as several women reported they had affairs with the golfer -- including one woman who allegedly had Woods on a voicemail asking her to take his name off her cell phone because ""my wife went through my phone and may be calling you."" Several of Woods' major sponsors, including AT&T and Accenture, ended their business relationships with Woods following the crash and the exposure of his marriage troubles. iReport: Share your thoughts on Woods' apology . But other companies, including Nike and Pepsi's Gatorade, continue to sponsor Woods, who has taken a break from his professional golfing career.

The thing I can't do is host a genuinely wonderful party.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan cricket is embroiled in a new controversy after the national team were accused of deliberately losing two games at the Champions Trophy by a government official. Younis Khan's future as Pakistan captain is in doubt following accusations of match-fixing. The chairman of the National Assembly's standing committee on sports claimed in a television interview that Pakistan lost to Australia to knock traditional rivals India out of the limited-overs tournament in South Africa. Australia won by two wickets by running a bye on the final ball of the closing Group A tie on September 30, which ensured they reached the semifinals and ended India's hopes. Captain Younis Khan then dropped a simple catch as his side lost to New Zealand by five wickets in Saturday's semifinal. ""We went with a pre-determined mind to lose the match against Australia,"" Jamshed Ahmed Dasti told Pakistan TV channel Geo TV on Tuesday. ""Our intention was to keep India out. It was a deliberate decision to lose the match against India."" Dasti said that the team also intentionally lost the match to New Zealand, who were beaten in Monday's final by defending champions Australia. ""That's why the NA Standing Committee on Sports has called in captain Younis Khan, coach Intikhab Alam and [Pakistan Cricket Board] chairman Ijaz Butt for investigations,"" he said. One report in Pakistan claimed that Younis and Intikhab had already been sacked by the PCB, but others said that Pakistan cricket's ruling body was happy with the team's performance. ""The team played well and tried hard. It is unfortunate they couldn't qualify for the final, which every player wanted to do, but they had one bad day against New Zealand,"" PCB spokesman Nadeem Sarwar told the Express Cricket Web site. ""As far as we are concerned, the team did well in the Champions Trophy and their performance was satisfactory."" Former captain Rashid Latif criticized Dasti for making serious allegations without backing them up with proof. ""I was one of those who first raised the issue of match fixing in international cricket, so I know what I am talking about. I can say the team did its best and played hard in the tournament -- a few mistakes cost them a place in the final,"" Latif told Express Cricket. ""I think parliamentarians should first look at the corruption in the government before talking about cricket. It is unfortunate that when the team needs backing, a parliamentarian should make such allegations."" The accusations are another blow for Pakistan's cricketing fortunes. The sub-continent nation lost the rights to host the Champions Trophy due to security issues -- it was postponed last year and switched to South Africa -- and was then ruled out of staging the 2011 World Cup. Earlier this year, veteran fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar missed the Twenty20 World Cup after needing treatment for genital warts. Akhtar, once Pakistan's most feared weapon, has constantly clashed with the PCB, which banned him for hitting a teammate with a bat in 2007 and threatened him with court action following a public feud which ended with a five-year suspension that he successfully appealed. The PCB also punished him for testing positive for the performance-enhancing drug nandrolone in 2006, while fellow fast bowler Mohammad Asif was arrested in Dubai for possession of illegal drugs last year.","Pakistan's cricket team has been accused of deliberately losing two games .

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- Some 700 people have been killed in clashes with Islamic militants in Nigeria, a military commander told CNN. Bodies of hard-line Islamic rebels killed in battle lie in a Nigerian city. Civilians and troops also have died. The fighting in the northeast Nigerian town of Maiduguri began with attacks by the Muslim militants on police and government targets, starting a week ago. Col. Ben Ahonotu, commander of the operation to combat Islamic militants, gave the new total. Previous reports said at least 400 rebels, troops and civilians had died in the region, including Borno, Yobe, Kano and Katsina states. Maiduguri is in Borno state. Ahonotu did not elaborate or provide further information, and it was unclear whether the 700 was in addition to the previous death toll. Attacks on police and government targets have been reported throughout the region. Boko Haram, an Islamist sect, wants the government to impose Islamic law, known as sharia, in the entire Muslim-dominated northern half of Nigeria. Sharia is already practiced in some northern states, but the sect wants even tougher religious laws and also opposes Western education. The southern half of Nigeria is predominantly Christian. A Boko Haram leader, Mohammed Yusuf, was reported captured Thursday by the military, but was found dead after he was turned over to police. Human rights groups are seeking more information on his death, and have also expressed concern about civilian casualties.","Hard-line Muslim militants fighting government troops in northern Nigeria .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Photos of the nude and decapitated body of a murdered hiker, sought by a writer on assignment for Hustler magazine, will not be released, a judge in Georgia ordered Wednesday. The decision came as state lawmakers considered legislation that would ban public release of graphic photos of crime victims. First Amendment lawyers say the legislation could have a chilling effect on open records requests. DeKalb Superior Court Judge Daniel Coursey issued a temporary order restraining the Georgia Bureau of Investigation from releasing ""any and all photographs, visual images or depictions of Meredith Emerson which show Emerson in an unclothed or dismembered state. Emerson's family sought the order after learning of the request for copies of crime scene photos of the 24-year-old, attorney Lindsay Haigh said. Emerson's admitted killer, Gary Michael Hilton, received a life sentence in exchange for leading investigators to her body in the north Georgia mountains on January 7, 2008, six days after Emerson disappeared. The judge's order came on the same day the Georgia House Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously passed ""The Meredith Emerson Memorial Privacy Act,"" which would prevent gruesome crime scene photos from being publicly released or disseminated, according to Rep. Jill Chambers, the bill's principal sponsor. House Bill 1322 would prevent the release of photographs of the bodies of crime victims that are ""nude, bruised, bloodied or in a broken state with open wounds, a state of dismemberment or decapitation,"" said Chambers. ""We have to walk the line between open record laws and the constitutional provisions that allow women to be able to be photographed nude or in pornography when they knowingly and willingly offer their bodies for dissemination,"" she said. ""Meredith isn't in a position to give that kind of permission to have her exploited in that kind of venue,"" Chambers said. ""We're not only protecting future victims of crime, we're protecting the integrity of what happened to Meredith."" The bill allows credentialed journalists, lawyers and law enforcement to view such photographs at the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's headquarters, Chambers said, but not make copies of them. Hustler did not respond to a request for comment on the judge's ruling except to say that it is exploring its legal options. ""Hustler is aware of the GBI's refusal to honor its reporter's request for copies of the Emerson crime scenes photos, which were to be used in a news story about this crime. Hustler and Mr. Flynt disagree with the GBI's position, and are currently exploring all legal options available to them should the decision be made to go forward with the story,"" the company said in an e-mail. Members of the state Legislature were quick to condemn the request. ""I think that the request is sickening, disgusting, vile and I think it's very, very hurtful for this family,"" House Speaker David Ralston said in a Monday press conference. Current statute prevents the release of autopsy photos without the permission of next of kin, but a ""gray area"" in the law left open the question of whether crime scene photos could be released, Ralston said. ""I am a big proponent of open government. This goes against the grain for me. But in this case, when you have these kind of photographs that depict victims of crime where there may have been sexual assault or mutilation of the body, I just think it goes beyond the pale,"" he said. ""We're going to narrow it to those situations so we don't have this kind of situation again where we pause and wonder is this something we have to release or not."" ""Meredith was a daughter, a friend and a mentor to many. She lived life to its fullest and was taken from us deliberately and maliciously,"" her family said on www.righttohikeinc.com, the charity Web site established in Emerson's memory. ""Her family and friends live everyday with this tragedy and to know that the possibility of any images, other than those that portray the beautiful, young woman we knew, could be disclosed to the public or may be published would bring further stress and unnecessarily added grief over what is already too much sadness to bear."" The Georgia Bureau of Investigation promptly denied Hustler's request, agency spokesman John Bankhead said. ""There's no public interest served by these photographs being publicly displayed,"" he said. ""The negative impact on surviving friends and family would be horrific. They had to go through this with the death so to have to go through it again with the pictures ending up on Internet would be incredible."" First Amendment lawyers are watching the outcome of this lawsuit and the bill. ""The photos are awful, but it's also awful to see pictures of people in wars, soldiers fighting or the victims of wars,"" said New York attorney Martin Garbus. ""I don't think there should be any kind of censorship because of awfulness."" Garbus surmised that privacy laws could be applied in this instance but cautioned that even such laws could be considered limitation of free speech. ""I don't think you can make it into a narrow context. If you look at a picture of a Sudanese kid starving to death, or people dying in Haiti, those are invasions of privacy. Pictures of people alive in tortuous situations in some other country are just as bad as pictures of disfigured corpses in the United States.""","Judge blocks release of photos of Meredith Emerson ""unclothed or dismembered""

"(CNN) -- Cliché trailers and unimpressed movie reviews aside, ""The Bounty Hunter"" was still expected to perform decently at the box office last weekend, some guessing a gross in the neighborhood of $25 million. In reality, the predictions weren't far off -- the actual box office gross came in at nearly $21 million, which BoxOffice.com editor Phil Contrino described as a solid opening weekend, if a little on the low side. The true surprise, Contrino said, was Twentieth Century Fox's ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" coming out of nowhere and edging past it with an opening weekend gross of $22 million. ""It's a situation where there's a movie with no stars aimed at a very specific age group -- teenage boys -- and it beat a movie with two stars,"" he said. Yet, Contrino added, Aniston has never been really reliable to open a movie on her own, and she was the bigger star in ""Bounty."" Gerard Butler, her co-star, is gaining prominence but doesn't have the years of recognition that Aniston has. The actress was nearly inescapable in 2005 as the media tracked her divorce from actor Brad Pitt, but her thriller ""Derailed"" and romantic comedy ""Rumor Has It"" performed modestly at the box office. Aniston then came back with a hit in 2006 with ""The Break-Up,"" co-starring Vince Vaughn, himself riding a wave of popularity from ""Wedding Crashers."" That success -- $39 million opening weekend and $118 million grossed domestically overall -- was immediately followed by ""Marley & Me,"" which grossed $36 million its first weekend, and ""He's Just Not That Into You,"" which Aniston starred in along with a number of other A-List actors. Yet 2009 brought the flop ""Love Happens,"" which grossed $8 million when it opened in little more than 1,500 theaters in 2009. By all accounts, ""Bounty Hunter,"" beaten by a movie about middle school kids or not, is a step in the right direction. Judging from her ups and downs at the box office, she's been ""far too hit or miss"" to be a safe bet at the box office, Contrino said. ""The moral of the story is that you can't bank on her."" Yet Aniston's public perception would lead one to believe otherwise, said film critic Nick Schager. ""In general, there's a disconnect between Jennifer Aniston's cultural popularity and her movie star popularity,"" Schager said. ""There are certain people -- and you could make the case for Angelina Jolie as well -- given how rampant tabloid culture has become who are much more famous for that stuff than they are for the actual movies or TV shows."" If anything, said US Weekly's Senior Movie Editor Bradley Jacobs, Aniston's cultural popularity is the reason ""Bounty Hunter"" got the dollars that it did, despite its current 8 percent fresh rating on RottenTomatoes.com. ""Despite terrible reviews, people still wanted to go,"" Jacobs said. ""Jennifer is still a movie star."" Aniston is one of the top celebrities that US Weekly covers, Jacobs said, and while her press attention may have something to do with her box office draw, Jacobs doesn't think it's the total sum. ""Jessica Simpson is covered a lot but she doesn't have box office power. Cameron Diaz, we cover her a fair amount and her movies have a spottier track,"" Jacobs said. ""There's something about Jennifer -- they love the hair, the body, the clothes and they've shown that they're willing to pay money."" Aniston, Schager believes, is indeed capable of carrying a movie. She just hasn't shown it yet. ""Aniston hasn't proven herself to be a reliable box office draw on her own, but she is a huge star. I think people like Jennifer Aniston, and if there's a movie that looks appealing, it'll do well,"" Schager said. ""But, she's been a bit overrated in the public conscious because of the extracurricular stuff, and that doesn't necessarily translate to her wanting to see her trade barbs with Gerard Butler."" Which, Schager adds, is really the more pressing point: ""Bounty Hunter"" wasn't great, and not even the brightest star can mask that. ""I think she's chosen poorly for the past few years,"" said Movieline.com senior editor Kyle Buchanan. ""If you look back before that she had 'Marley and Me' and 'The Break Up,' and her indie at that point was 'Friends With Money,' which was a critical success."" ""Bounty Hunter,"" on the other hand, ""seems like a retread of 'The Ugly Truth' from last year. Audiences didn't really care,"" Buchanan said. He added that while ""the amount of hype that we get for Jennifer Aniston is always going to exceed the amount of box office she's going to bring,"" she's still one of the Top 10 actresses. ""She can command an audience, but she has to be in the right vehicle."" The other industry reality to consider, BoxOffice.com's Contrino said, is that none of the A-list actors, save for a few, are consistently opening with huge numbers anymore. ""I think there's a misconception that for a movie to open, it has to have major stars -- nothing could be further from the truth,"" Contrino said. ""If you look at 2009, some of the biggest hits of the year didn't have major names -- with 'The Hangover,' character actors opened the movie based on the concept. It was the same with 'District 9' and 'Paranormal Activity,' which is the golden standard of this argument."" Buchanan agreed that these days, audiences care more about the content than which actor is headlining. ""In the '80s and '90s, there were a dozen stars you could count on to open a movie,"" Buchanan said. ""The days for any actor, male or female, opening a movie based on their name alone are numbered.""","Jennifer Aniston's ""Bounty Hunter"" performed just shy of expectations .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods said Sunday that he is focused on ""living a life of amends"" after ""living the life of a lie"" in one of his first interviews since a November car crash outside his home unleashed a media frenzy amid rumors of extramarital affairs. The brief, five-minute interview on ESPN was one of two the professional golfer granted Sunday afternoon at the Isleworth golf club near his home outside Orlando, Florida. The Golf Channel simultaneously aired its similarly brief interview with Woods on Sunday night. Woods credited inpatient and outpatient therapy for helping him start the process toward making amends. ""It was tough,"" he told ESPN's Tom Rinaldi of the therapy. ""To look at yourself in a light that you never want to look at yourself, that's pretty brutal. ... I saw a person that I never thought I would ever become."" Woods said two of his lowest points in the past four months came when he had to tell his wife, Elin Woods, and his mother about his affairs. ""Those are the two people in my life who I'm closest to, and to say the things that I've done, truthfully to them, is ... honestly ... was ... very painful,"" he said. Woods told The Golf Channel's Kelly Tilghman that his mentor and father, the late Earl Woods, ""would be very disappointed in me."" ""I wish I could have had his guidance through all of this,"" he told Tilghman. ""Have him help straighten me up. I know he would have done it."" Despite the open nature of the interviews -- both Rinaldi and Tilghman weren't restricted on the questions they could ask  -- the notoriously private Woods declined to go into detail about the night of the November car crash, telling Rinaldi that ""it's all on the police report."" ""Beyond that, everything is between Elin and myself, and that's private,"" Woods said. He also declined to specify what treatment he has been seeking, but did say it will continue despite his announcement last week that he will return to golf at the Masters next month. ""I'm excited to get back and play,"" he told Rinaldi. ""I'm excited to get to see the guys again. ... I miss competing. But still, I still have a lot more treatment to do, and just because I'm playing, doesn't mean I'm gonna stop going to treatment."" When asked about what reaction he expects from the fans, Woods said: ""I don't know. I'm a little nervous about that to be honest with you. ... It would be nice to hear a couple claps here and there. But I also hope they clap for birdies, too."" In closing her interview, Tilghman asked Woods about a bracelet he was wearing. ""It's Buddhist,"" he said. ""It's for protection and strength. And I certainly need that.""","Telling wife, mother about his affairs were low points, Woods tells ESPN .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts grand jury has indicted a 98-year-old woman, accused of strangling her 100-year-old nursing-home roommate, on a second-degree murder charge. Prosecutors say Laura Lundquist killed centenarian Elizabeth Barrow, a resident of Brandon Woods Nursing Home in Dartmouth, after the two women had an argument over a table Lundquist had placed at the foot of Barrow's bed. Barrow was found dead September 24 with a plastic shopping bag tied loosely around her head, according the Bristol County district attorney's office. An autopsy indicated Barrow had been strangled. Barrow complained that the table obstructed her path to the bathroom, authorities said. When a nurse's aide moved it, Lundquist punched the aide and grumbled that her roommate ""might as well have the whole room,"" prosecutors said. District Attorney C. Samuel Sutter said Barrow repeatedly complained that Lundquist was making her life ""a living hell"" in the weeks leading up to the woman's death, and that Lundquist remarked that she would outlive her roommate. A nursing home spokesman said the facility twice presented Barrow with the chance to change either rooms or roommates, but she declined each time. He compared the pair to ""sisters,"" saying they took ""daily walks together ... ate lunch together every day, and were heard at night saying, 'Good night, I love you,' to each other."" Lundquist's attorney, Carl Levin, contends his client was not involved in Barrow's death, saying, ""We maintain her innocence."" A superior court judge granted a motion to send Lundquist to a state hospital for a competency evaluation. An arraignment will be held only if Lundquist is found competent to stand trial.","Prosecutors say Laura Lundquist, 98, strangled Elizabeth Barrow, 100 .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- It was as if the giant crowd were celebrating a joyous occasion -- not a coming-together one month after a deadly earthquake. Thousands of Haitians, many of them smiling, gathered Friday at the center of Port-au-Prince to remember the 7.0-magnitude quake of January 12 that leveled most of their capital city. A sea of people waved their arms in the air, prayed, cried, sang and -- where space permitted -- danced. The earthquake is blamed for killing more than 212,000 people, injuring 300,000 and leaving more than 1 million homeless in the city of 3 million and surrounding communities. The memorial took place near where the stately National Palace lies in ruins and the Champ de Mars square has been turned into a huge homeless camp. Other memorials were taking place at shantytowns, and there were religious observations. Haitians were urged to wear black or white. There was an outpouring of aid from around the world after the quake -- more than 600 aid agencies rallied -- but, initially, much of their work was ineffective because of the chaos, including the disruption of the government after its buildings collapsed. Relief operations are improving day by day, a spokeswoman for the International Rescue Committee told CNN on Friday. ""Things [supplies] are moving now, and they are arriving to populations. The bottleneck has really, really decreased,"" Aisha Bain said. ""About a month ago, when this quake destroyed the infrastructure of Haiti, it was very complicated to get aid in,"" she said. Now, ""the ports and airports aren't at full capacity, but things are arriving and getting to populations. There is much more to be done, but food is coming in."" Food distribution areas are set up around the capital, she said. According to the U.S. ambassador to Haiti, food is now being delivered routinely to 16 sites daily, and Haitians are receiving two weeks of rations. The food is culturally appropriate, Kenneth Merten said. ""One month on ... I think we are in a very good place in terms of food distribution, water distribution and getting medicines out to needy hospitals,"" he said. The United States is working with many nations and organizations to do that. ""The next issues we're most concerned about are sanitation issues and shelter issues,"" Merten said during a State Department news conference. As the rainy season approaches, ""we want to make sure we have reached and touched as many people as possible."" The rainy season comes with the approach of spring. The hurricane season begins June 1. Relief workers are providing temporary camps with latrines and portable toilets, and that project isn't finished, Merten said. Bain said her organization also is trying to provide sufficient sanitation. ""We ... are working on a large-scale buildup of providing clean water, latrines, showers, hand-washing stations, which affect not only the livelihoods of basic survival but, really, health. There's a massive concern of the possible outbreak of disease, and so we are working to combat that quickly."" Watch Bain talk about the situation in Haiti . On Thursday, Nevada real estate developer Tom Schrade said he was donating three used Cirque du Soleil tents for use as a temporary headquarters for the government and a hospital in Port-au-Prince. They will provide a total of 33,000 square feet of space, he said. Medically, ""things have improved in a very good way,"" compared with the period right after the quake, when doctors were dealing with broken bones, crushed limbs and other acute conditions, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. The medical establishment is much more organized. However, recovery facilities are grossly inadequate, he said. Of the people lined up recently at one of Port-au-Prince's largest public hospitals, most were suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes. Many have never seen a doctor, he said. After treatment, most patients -- even those who have had major surgery -- end up in a temporary tent city that is dirty and lacks medications, follow-up care and nutritious food, Gupta said. Recent rain didn't help, he said, and there is fear that improvements won't be made before monsoons come. ""People are trying to recover in a temporary tent city that is increasingly becoming more permanent,"" Gupta said.","Thousands unite in Port-au-Prince to remember 7.0-magnitude earthquake .

"(CNN) -- Simply put, Margaret Moth made an impression. Given her jet-black hair, thick black eyeliner, black clothes and combat boots (which she often slept in while on assignment), people didn't always know what to think upon meeting her. She was quirky, the sort who excused herself from a social gathering by saying she had to wash her socks. And she was fearless, the kind of woman who not only kept the camera rolling while under fire, but zoomed in on a soldier who was shooting at her. Colleagues learned quickly to appreciate all that this CNN camerawoman was. Beyond her rich personality, which included deep optimism and kindness, she brought to her profession top-notch technical abilities, unmatched dedication and an approach to work that inspired others to push themselves. CNN colleagues honor Moth . Moth sought out, even demanded, assignments in conflict zones. She barely survived being shot in the face in Sarajevo in 1992, only to go back as soon as she was physically able. The multiple reconstructive surgeries that followed, as well as the hepatitis C she contracted from a consequent blood transfusion, were mere obstacles she moved around. But more than three years after being diagnosed with colon cancer, her tremendous life journey has come to an end. Moth, known for her gutsiness, striking appearance, distinctive humor and sense of fun, died early Sunday in Rochester, Minnesota.  She was 59. ""Dying of cancer, I would have liked to think I'd have gone out with a bit more flair,"" she said with a laugh last spring during an interview with a CNN documentary crew that had traveled to Texas, where she was visiting friends. ""The important thing is to know that you've lived your life to the fullest,"" she said then, before tubing down a river in Austin, Texas; taking jaunts to Cape Cod and the Canadian Rockies; and piloting a houseboat up the Mississippi River -- replete with beer and Cuban cigars. ""I don't know anyone who's enjoyed life more."" Born Margaret Wilson in Gisborne, New Zealand, to a homemaker and a man who made swimming pools, she got her first camera at age 8. She later changed her name to Margaret Gipsy Moth, a nod to the airplane, which was appropriate for a woman who had a penchant for jumping out of planes, barefoot. She said she never aspired to be a photojournalist. Rather her path, she explained, was mostly driven by a love of history and her desire to see it unfold firsthand. Whether she was amid rioters after Indira Gandhi's assassination or covering a long menu of wars spanning continents, Moth felt she and her colleagues were the lucky ones. ""You could be a billionaire, and you couldn't pay to do the things we've done,"" said Moth, who had most recently called Istanbul, Turkey, home. Reported to be New Zealand's first camerawoman, she came to the U.S. and worked for KHOU in Houston, Texas, for about seven years before moving to CNN in 1990. When other photojournalists dived behind cars as militiamen opened fire on protesters in Tbilisi, Georgia, she stood her ground and kept her camera running. As a band of medical professionals defied Israeli tanks and armored vehicles, marching into then-Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's compound in the West Bank, she got in the middle of the group, joined them and helped nab an exclusive interview. When many around her slept in Sarajevo, she set to work in a destroyed hotel room, filming with a night scope through holes blown out by artillery fire, hiding herself and camera from the eyes of snipers. The Serbian sniper bullet that did hit Moth while she was traveling along ""sniper alley"" in Sarajevo shattered her jaw, blew out her teeth and destroyed a portion of her tongue -- which left her forever sounding like she was drunk, she said. Others got angry, as the van she traveled in was clearly marked as a press vehicle, but she refused to go there. "" 'We came into their war. Fair's fair,' "" former CNN correspondent Stefano Kotsonis, who was with her when she was shot, remembered her saying. "" 'I don't blame anyone for firing at me. They're in a war, and I stepped into it.' "" Her attitude made other colleagues, many of whom were interviewed for the documentary ""Fearless: The Margaret Moth Story,"" strive to be better at what they did. Sound techs and correspondents would often follow her lead, whether they felt ready or not. She was known to outrun her own security. Photojournalists viewed her as a bar-setter. Another of CNN's international camerawomen remembers Moth . Christiane Amanpour, CNN's chief international correspondent, who'd been away from Sarajevo when her friend was shot, was sitting at Moth's hospital bedside when an assignment editor from the international desk called. He wanted to know if Amanpour was ready to return to the conflict zone, she recalled for the documentary about Moth. ""I said I'd go back, and I know to this day that if I hadn't said yes then, I probably never would have gone back, and I never would have done this career. But I said yes because I couldn't say no,"" Amanpour remembered, fighting back tears. ""We did the work for her. We did it because she was our champion, and we wanted to be her champion."" Sure enough, as soon as Moth could carry a camera again, six months later, she went straight back to Sarajevo to join her CNN colleagues. She joked that she was there to find her teeth. Moth maintained her humor amid madness and helped others smile and unwind when the surroundings could make levity seem impossible. She enlisted a producer to go rollerblading with her on the marble floors of a Baghdad, Iraq, hotel lobby. She forced colleagues to tell her who they'd rather sleep with, while giving them horrifying choices. She liked to kick back with fine cigars and could drink others under the table. Despite her tough exterior, there was insecurity, a vanity to her. No matter where she was, Moth rose early to do her eye makeup and hair. Forever worried about her weight, she picked at a block of cheese in Bosnia for about six weeks and got by on mango juice during a stretch in the West Bank. She admitted that after being shot, she was more afraid of what she'd look like than she was of dying. Enveloped in bandages, she slipped her dear friend Joe Duran a note asking him if she looked like a monster. But she often worried about others more than herself. Moth enjoyed working with seasoned correspondents but also looked out for those who were new. In Pakistan, she taught Patty Sabga to sleep behind couches and talked her through everything she was shooting to help Sabga build her stories. And in Afghanistan, she carefully led the former CNN correspondent through rubble that probably hid land mines. ""She took such incredible care of me and taught me so much,"" Sabga said. ""I can honestly say that the work I did with Margaret Moth is still the very best work of my career."" Moth repeatedly visited the doctor who saved her life. And she boosted the spirits and changed the attitude of another CNN photojournalist, David Allbritton, when he was seriously injured by a bomb in Sarajevo in 1995. ""She made me realize that I was going to get through this,"" he said. ""She set an example by overcoming everything that's happened to her. ... I took that example, and I'm shooting today. I'm not sure that I would be doing what I'm doing today if it had not been for Margaret Moth."" Her chosen lifestyle didn't leave room for children of her own, but she bonded with them across the globe. And her love of animals was so deep that she refused to ride in a horse-pulled wagon, preferring to run with heavy equipment in the desert heat while on assignment in Petra, Jordan. In fact, when it became clear that the advanced cancer would end her life, the concern that drove her to tears was her cats -- the more than 25 strays she looked after in Istanbul. ""She was more upset about them than she was about dying,"" said Duran, who rushed to her side after she'd been medevaced out of Sarajevo. But when Duran, also a CNN cameraman, moved into her home in Turkey with the promise that he'd care for the cats, he said Moth told him, "" 'Now I can die happy.' "" Duran was by Moth's side when she died. He said he will be taking her ashes back to Istanbul, where he will place them in her garden, beside a photograph of her. There, as she wanted, she'll be able to hang out with her cats. There were a few things Moth wished she had done. She would have liked to have seen the Krak des Chevaliers, a medieval fortress in Syria, and the Burundi drummers. But regrets? She had none. She ""led the complete life,"" Amanpour said. ""I don't think Margaret could ever look back and say, 'What if?' She did it to the max, and she did it brilliantly. And she did it on her terms."" CNN colleagues and friends of Margaret Moth contributed to this report.","Her guts, skill and humor made Margaret Moth one to remember .

"(CNN) -- India are poised to build a handy first-innings lead over South Africa after Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar scored centuries on the second day of the second cricket Test in Kolkata. The home side, needing to win to level the series and retain their No. 1 ranking in the five-day game, reached 342-5 when bad light halted play early on Monday, having bowled the Proteas out for 296 in the morning session. Opener Sehwag smashed a scintillating 165 off only 174 balls faced, hitting 23 boundaries and two sixes as he added 249 for the third wicket with Tendulkar. The veteran Tendulkar extended his world record of Test tons to 47 as he took on the junior role, facing 206 deliveries for his 106. Sehwag, who was dropped by J.P. Duminy on 47, had threatened South African Jacques Kallis's record for the fastest half-century but suffered a brief lull in run flow before passing the mark in just 41 deliveries. He and Gautam Gambhir put on 73 for the first wicket in just 9.2 overs before the latter was run out for 25, then paceman Morne Morkel had Murali Vijay caught behind by stand-in wicketkeeper A.B. De Villiers for seven. India reached lunch at 97-2 and Sehwag raced to three figures in only 87 balls for his 19th Test century as the duo batted through the middle session, going to tea at 232-2. They both fell late in the day as part-time bowler Duminy removed Tendulkar and fellow spinner Paul Harris dismissed Tendulkar, then paceman Dale Steyn bowled Subramaniam Badrinath for one. V.V.S. Laxman (9) and nightwatchman Amit Mishra (1) survived until stumps as India extended their lead to 46. South Africa had resumed on 266-9 after a late collapse on Sunday, and tailenders Morne Morkel and Wayne Parnell added another 30 runs for a final-wicket stand of 35. Left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan finally ended their resistance, trapping Parnell leg before wicket for 12 in his first over of the day to finish with figures of 4-90. Spinner Harbhajan Singh claimed three wickets on Sunday. Meanwhile, New Zealand reached 258-5 on a rain-hit opening day of the one-off Test against tourists Bangladesh in Hamilton. The Kiwis slumped to 66-3 after Monday's start was delayed by an hour due to wet conditions, but Martin Guptill then added 60 with Ross Taylor (40) and an unbroken 100 with Brendon McCullum to guide the home team safely to stumps. No. 3 batsman Peter Ingram crashed 42 off 47 deliveries before becoming the second of Rubel Hossain's three victims, but it was Guptill's more measured Test best score of 80 that anchored the innings. The big-hitting McCullum kept the score ticking over as he celebrated his 50th Test with his 16th half-century, ending the day on 58 from 71 deliveries.","India reach 342-5 on second day of second Test against South Africa in Kolkata .

"London, England (CNN) -- Spanish banking giant Santander on Monday began its campaign to rename hundreds of Abbey and Bradford and Bingley bank branches across Britain. The banking group acquired Abbey in 2004, before it purchased Bradford & Bingley and the Alliance & Leicester in 2008. The first of 300 official Santander branches in the south-east of England was launched in London Monday morning by Banco Santander Chairman Emilio Botín, with a further 700 branches across the UK expected to follow suit by the end of January. In a statement Botin said: ""This is a historic day for Santander as its name is firmly established on the UK high street. ""When Santander acquired Abbey in 2004, there were some who doubted we could make it a success. Today, there can be no doubts. ""Over the last five years we have transformed our UK business into one of the most successful banks in the country. The decision to become Santander will put us in an even stronger position the UK."" António Horta-Osório, Chief Executive of Santander UK, added: ""The success of our UK business has given us the confidence to move to the Santander name now and with it deliver the next phase of our transformation program and make 1,300 branches available to our 25 million customers in the UK. ""I am confident that this is a very positive move - both for our customers and our employees."" Over the next few years, Santander says it aims to increase the number of products each of its customers hold through increasingly competitive and market-leading products to its customer base. At the end of 2008, Santander, which was founded in 1857, was the largest bank in the euro zone by market capitalization and third in the world by profit. It has has 90 million customers, around 14,000 branches -- more than any other international bank -- and over 170,000 employees.","Santander bought Abbey in 2004, Bradford & Bingley, Alliance & Leicester in 2008 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Just months after the 9/11 attacks, the United States appeared to have its biggest catch in the newly launched war on terror. Abu Zubaydah, considered one of al Qaeda's senior lieutenants, lay in a pool of blood on a street in Faisalabad, Pakistan, having been shot three times during a U.S.-coordinated raid on a house where a group of suspected terrorists was building a bomb. CIA operative John Kiriakou, who helped plan the raid, rushed to the scene. But when he gazed down at the critically wounded man, it didn't quite look like the person he had seen in a 4-year-old passport. In his new book, ""The Reluctant Spy,"" Kiriakou gives an insider's view of his secret life as a spy and his role in fighting the war on terror. Kiriakou said he was able to quickly verify Zubaydah's identity by sending a picture of his ear to CIA headquarters in Virginia. ""I didn't realize until that night that no two people have the same ears. It's like a fingerprint,"" he said. The American spy was ordered by then-CIA Director George Tenet to do everything in his power to keep Zubaydah alive and to never let him out of his sight. That's exactly what Kiriakou did. Rushed to a rundown Pakistani hospital, Zubaydah barely made it through surgery. Word had apparently gotten out to al Qaeda where he was being treated. ""Al Qaeda people started driving by the hospital just opening fire on the hospital,"" Kiriakou said, and a Pakistani security officer quickly arranged for a helicopter to transfer Zubaydah to a military base. Once on the base, Kiriakou used a sheet to tie the comatose Zubaydah to his bed and then stood watch. When Zubaydah finally woke up, Kiriakou tried to speak with him in Arabic. Zubaydah refused, telling him in perfect English that he would not talk in what he called ""God's language."" Strangely enough, Kiriakou said, Zubaydah then asked for a glass of red wine. After a few hours of sleep, the prisoner pleaded for Kiriakou to kill him -- to smother him with a pillow. After a couple of days, Zubaydah was transferred to an undisclosed location for further treatment. That was the last time Kiriakou saw him. Kiriakou said his conversations with Zubaydah were surprising. ""I expected an irrational, radical, hate-filled, hard-core terrorist, and what I got was a frightened young guy who realized he was in way over his head, had made terrible mistakes and was going to pay for it."" Kiriakou also tells the story of Zubaydah's cell phone ringing shortly after his capture. No one could answer it because FBI agents who took part in the raid had placed the phone in a sealed evidence bag and wouldn't open it. Kiriakou said a valuable lead may have been lost. ""I should have opened the bag and snatched the phone,"" the former CIA operative said. Iraq played a prominent role in Kiriakou's CIA career, most notably his role in supporting the U.S. policy to go to war. In summer 2002, Kiriakou was back working at headquarters in Virginia when he was summoned to a top-secret meeting. He said he was told the Bush administration had decided the United States was going to invade Iraq in the spring -- it was a done deal. His job was to support the mission. Kiriakou said he was dumbfounded. ""Here was someone at the CIA, obviously plugged into the plans of the executive branch, telling us that the public debate in Congress, reflected almost daily in the press, meant nothing."" Months later, Congress passed a war resolution. The book is filled with many more stories about Kiriakou's experiences as a spy, including how he tried to avoid surveillance in Greece and discovered he was being tailed, what it was like being in charge of foreign agents, and the fear of a pending terrorist attack just before September 11, 2001. Kiriakou also discussed the CIA's use of harsh interrogation techniques on detainees. In 2007, several years after he left the agency, Kiriakou was the first official to publicly confirm Washington's worst-kept secret: that Zubaydah had been waterboarded. He didn't have firsthand knowledge, but he said he had read cables that indicated the simulated drowning technique was used just once, because Zubaydah cracked and provided actionable intelligence. However, a government report released in summer 2009 said the technique was actually used 83 times against Zubaydah. Kiriakou said he now feels he was duped by the agency. He questioned whether any useful information really came from the detainee and said he believes ""it caused more damage to our national prestige than was worth it."" Kiriakou left the CIA in 2004 after serving 14 years in the agency. He's now a senior investigator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.","New book is John Kiriakou's view of life as a spy, role in fighting war on terror .

"London, England (CNN) -- The downfall of Tiger Woods has left the golf world eager for an uplifting story, and arguably there are few better placed to provide this tale than 20-year-old Michelle Wie. The women's game may struggle to compete with the men's in terms of profile, but if there is any player who could help to bridge this gap it is the Stanford University student from Hawaii. The expectation on Wie has always been great after she amazed the sport by qualifying for the USGA amateur championship aged just 10. She went onto become the youngest player ever to qualify for the LPGA Tour and became a millionaire 10 times over by signing sponsorship deals with both Sony and Nike after turning professional aged 16. The similarities with Tiger Woods were clear for all to see.  Her fame grew as she persisted to compete in men's competitions while suffering inconsistent form at women's events, but she had to wait until 2009 to capture her first LPGA title. With her victory at the Lorena Ochoa Invitational and starring role in the 2009 Solheim Cup, Michelle Wie has once again captivated fans and gone some way to reassure doubters that she still has the potential to become a major force in women's golf. With the 2010 LPGA season due to tee off next month, Living Golf caught up with Wie to discuss her plans for the year ahead in work and play: . ""I love what I do. Once my college work is done, I get to go out and focus on my golf. Academically right now, I'm a sophomore, but I'm in my third year, so hopefully I'll finish in five years or so,"" she told CNN. Like many students her age, friends play an important role: ""They bring me down to earth you know. They always make fun of me and they don't know what I do, they don't know what a par is. Basically I tell them, if my scores look red, you can call me, if my scores look black, then I might not be in such a good mood so don't talk to me!"" The Solheim Cup marked a turning point for Wie, proving she could hit shots beyond her female counterparts. Wie says it was an unforgettable experience: ""It was such a great experience, I've always heard that rumor that, the American team doesn't bond as well as the European team, but I felt that we just bonded so well and had so much fun -- I really enjoyed every second of it."" Despite this, there still remains a cloud of disapproval over the way in which Wie has conducted herself throughout her career. Entering her first PGA Tour event at the tender age of 14, her attempts and failures to make it on the men's tour have drawn criticism from players and fans. So does she regret these early decisions? ""No, I don't think so. I think that every decision that I've made in my life, at the time seemed like a great decision ... the mistakes that I've made, I've definitely learned from them. But you know, I enjoyed myself and I really had a lot of fun."" While the sun shone on Michelle Wie in 2009, the LPGA experienced a difficult year. Like the men's Tour, financial crisis saw sponsors and media pull out -- and a seriously diminished schedule of events for 2010 led to the dismissal of LPGA Commissioner Carolyn Bivens. Despite the turmoil, Wie feels the tour will bounce back: . ""I just think that we have such a strong product, you know the players are amazing, we have different personalities, its so global, so international -- there's so many ethnicities which gives us more opportunity to be in different countries that never really had golf before."" As she looks ahead to this year, Wie's resolve remains clear: to build on her new found confidence and success: ""I want to show my fans and my country what I have.""","The 2009 Solheim Cup marked a turning point for Wie .

"(CNN) -- When Eldrick ""Tiger"" Woods joined the ranks of professional golf a dozen years ago, it was via the heralded ""Hello, World"" Nike commercial. When he steps to the podium Friday to speak to an assembled group of friends, colleagues and journalists, the world will truly be watching to see and hear the greatest golfer of this generation talk about the sordid events over the last three months that have kept him off the golf course and shredded his well-cultivated image and reputation. The broadcast networks will air live reports with their main anchors there to report and comment on every word; the cable nets will undoubtedly have multiple individuals ready for instant analysis; and millions will tune in to hear Tiger likely apologize and possibly say if and when he will return to competitive golf. He isn't expected to take any questions, and that has made for an angry bunch of columnists and commentators, denouncing Woods for calling a news conference to make a statement, and not undergo the grilling many want to give him. Woods hasn't even said a word, and already he's been called a spoiled, petulant child who has lived in a sheltered world of handlers since he was 2 years old. Some have even gone as far as saying nothing has changed about him and he's showing that he is just as selfish and self-absorbed as ever. Tiger, let me be as clear as I can as to whether you owe me or the American people an explanation of the events surrounding your car accident Thanksgiving weekend: Hell no. I repeat: Tiger, you don't owe me or anyone else anything! I'm sick of these sanctimonious folks who are blabbering about Woods needing to be grilled about his private behavior. Look, Tiger Woods didn't cheat on me. He's not my daddy, brother, cousin, church member, neighbor or friend. He didn't let me down or crush my view of him. He is not and never was my role model. The only people he owes a grand apology are his wife, momma, family, maybe his friends, and his children, when they come of age. He doesn't have to work hard for me to trust him again. The most important audience he has to satisfy is a very small group of people. That's it. Nothing more. Nothing less. Ever since I was 14, my desire was to be journalist. And in the last 27 years, I've covered it all. In all of those years, I've never believed I was entitled to ask anyone a question. If it was at a county government board meeting in Austin, Texas, or a city council meeting in Fort Worth, Texas, public officials made a choice to talk to me and other journalists. It's our duty to ask; it's not their obligation to answer. Yes, they were public figures, but no matter how many times I asked the same question, they didn't have to talk to the media. Should they? Yeah. Must they? No. Every sports league has a rule requiring their locker rooms to be open to the media shortly after a game ends. Athletes are required to make themselves available or face a fine, but there is nothing that says they must answer our questions. If they choose to expound on what happened in a game, that's their decision. But their personal life? That choice is all up to them. We have had to bear witness to all kinds of allegations about Tiger, the married sports star and successful product pitchman, being involved in a variety of affairs with cocktail waitresses, party girls, and porn stars. The details have gone from freaky to bizarre. His reputation has taken a substantial hit; companies he endorsed have removed his face from billboards and canceled contracts; and by multiple (and unsubstantiated) accounts, his marriage is hanging by a thread. Yet still, he doesn't owe the American public or me a damn thing. Meryl Streep has always earned my respect. When you see magazine cover stories on her, such as the recent one in Vanity Fair, she will talk about a host of subjects and pose for a ton of photos, but her family is off limits. She makes it clear: I'll talk about the work, not my home life. Jodie Foster is the same way. If she is scheduled to discuss a movie, anything work-related is fine. But when you start asking about the father of her children, her love life and anything personal, she shuts you down quickly. In fact, her folks will let you know before the interview what the rules are. She's consistent and clear. Intensely private people choose to remain that way, whether loving and faithful couples or a married athlete who is accused of bedding anyone and everyone. Someone's personal life is just that, personal. None of us have the right to know what's going on in someone else's life when they are out of public view, especially if no laws were broken. I've been clear that I'm a huge Tiger Woods fan. I've walked inside the ropes of many golf tournaments he's played in; shot hundreds of photos of him that hang on my wall; and count an interview with his father, Earl Woods, as one of my all-time favorites. But journalists need to cut the crap when it comes to demanding that he owes it to us to talk to as many of us as possible. What's amazing is that many of us are hypocrites on this subject. For example, if a journalist is fired, you will hear the suits at the company say they cannot discuss the actions behind the move ""because it's a personnel matter."" Wait. Isn't a TV anchor, columnist or reporter a public figure? In some cities, they are considered celebrities. So the rules are different for us? In fact, what if a reporter covered a news conference and returned with a team owner or elected official saying the following about one of their employees: ""That's a personnel matter and I'm not at liberty to share with you the details of his termination."" Would that editor, news director, or network president say that is acceptable? No! They would jump all over the reporter ""to do their job"" and keep digging to find out what happened. And the columnists and bloggers would be ripping them to shreds. So what's the difference between them and Tiger? Personnel? Personal? Hello! Isn't it amazing how different the view looks from the other side of the river? iReport: Share your reaction to Woods' statement . We live in an age where public figures often share with the world who they slept with, want to sleep with, what they ate, what they wear, their travel and everything else. Nothing is off limits. The public craves it all on blogs, and in magazines, newspapers, TV and radio. For me, I don't care about any of it. All I want is to see is a good movie, dance to a great song, watch an awesome sporting event, and witness one golfer take on his peers to become the greatest in the game. When that public figure, whether Meryl, Jodie or Tiger, chooses to walk off the public stage, they don't owe me or anyone else an explanation. Their body of work is all that matters and that is what we will discuss for generations to come. Nothing more. Nothing less. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S.

"SANA'A, Yemen (CNN) -- It is midday and girls are flooding out of school. Nujood Ali is not among them. Nujood Ali today is angry and skips school but is still relieved her defiance paid off. We find her at the family's two-room house in an impoverished suburb of the Yemeni capital. Nujood is angry, combative and yelling. Tension surrounds the home like a noose. After much arguing with family members, Nujood  finally grabs her veil and agrees to sit down with CNN. Her presence is grudging, although CNN got advance permission to see how the girl who rocked a nation by demanding a divorce was faring. Nujood is a very different girl from the one we met nearly two years ago. Then, there was no doubt the 10-year-old was very much a child, a portrait of innocence. She had a shy smile, playful nature and a whimsical giggle. Her retiring demeanor was very much at odds with the brutal abuse she endured as a child bride who fought for a divorce and is still currently fighting.  Watch Nujood tell her story to CNN on World's Untold Stories » . The story was supposed to end with the divorce. There was, though, a stunning transformation. The young girl went from being a victim and child bride to a portrait of courage and triumph. Her inspirational story was told and re-told around the world. In the fall of 2008, Nujood was recognized as Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year, alongside some of the world's most impressive women. She even attended the ceremony in New York and was applauded by women from Hillary Clinton to Nicole Kidman. There is a tell-all book, which is to be published in more than 20 languages, and the author says the girl will receive a good portion of the royalties. Nujood's strength was celebrated by complete strangers. But what did all the fame do for the one person it was meant to transform? ""There is no change at all since going on television,"" Nujood says bitterly. ""I hoped there was someone to help us, but we didn't find anyone. It hasn't changed a thing. They said they were going to help me and no one has helped me. I wish I had never spoken to the media."" Nujood says she is still relieved and gratified that her act of defiance paid off. There was never going to be a fortune. Generous people have donated thousands so Nujood could go to a private school, but she refuses to attend, according to Shada Nasser, the human rights lawyer who took on the child's divorce case. ""I know Nujood was absent from the school. I spoke with her father and her family. And I ask them to control her and ask her to go every day to school. But they said, 'You know we don't have the money for the transportation. Don't have the money for the food,' "" says Nasser. She believes Nujood is being victimized by her own family because they believe her fame should bring them fortune. Nujood's parents say they've received nothing, and in the meantime the girl wonders aloud how everything turned out this way. ""I was happy I got divorced but I'm sad about the way it turned out after I went on television,"" she said, adding that she feels like an outcast even among  family and friends. Nujood was pulled out of school in early 2008 and married off by her own parents to a man she says was old and ugly. And yet, as a wife, she was spared nothing. ""I didn't want to sleep with him but he forced me to, he hit me, insulted me,"" she said. She described being married and living as a wife at such a young age as sheer torture. Nujood described how she was beaten and raped and how, after just a few weeks of marriage, she turned to her family to try to escape the arrangement. But her parents told her they could not protect her, that she belonged to her husband now and had to accept her fate. CNN tried to get comment from the girl's ex-husband and family, but they declined. Nujood's parents, like many others in Yemen, struck a social bargain. More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18, many times to older men, some with more than one wife. Marriage means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents. But Nujood's parents say they did not expect the girl's new husband to demand sex from his child bride. To escape, Nujood hailed a taxi -- the first time in her life -- to get across town to the central courthouse where she sat on a bench and demanded to see a judge. After several hours, a judge finally went to see her. ""And he asked me, 'what do you want' and I said 'I want a divorce' and he said 'you're married?' And I said 'yes.'"" says Nujood. Nujood's father and husband were arrested until the divorce hearing, and the girl was put in the care of Nasser. It seems the judge had heard enough of the abuse to agree with her that she should get her divorce. But based on the principles of Shariah law, her husband was compensated, not prosecuted. Nujood was ordered to pay him more than $200 -- a huge amount in a country where the United Nations Development Programme says 15.7 percent of the population lives on less than $1 a day. Khadije Al Salame is working to help the girl get her life back. Now a Yemeni diplomat, she too was a child bride 30 years ago. But when she left her husband, she did not have to endure the publicity that now haunts Nujood. She said: ""It's good to talk about Nujood and to have her story come out, but the problem is it's too much pressure on her. ""She doesn't understand what's going on. She's a little girl and we have to understand as media people that we should leave her alone now. If we really love Nujood then we should just let her go to school and continue with her life, because education is the most important thing for her."" To get her divorce, Nujood showed character and strength not easily expressed by women in Yemen, let alone a 10-year-old child bride. But she will need to muster all that strength and more if she's to finally reclaim her life. Nujood told us she thought the divorce would be the end of her struggle. But she's angry that it turned out to be just the beginning. CNN producer Schams Elwazer contributed to this report .","Child who got divorce in Yemen struggling to be a child again .

"Editor's Note: Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, represents the Third District of Utah in Congress and is writing a regular series of reports for CNN.com on his freshman year. For his bio, read here. For a Democratic freshman's view, read here. Jason Chaffetz says he's saving money by sleeping on a cot in his office, but there are downsides. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- I do something a bit different than most members of Congress. I sleep in my office on a cot. A few months ago, I was speaking with a current member of Congress and he said he slept in his office. Awesome! We are paid well, but the cost of caring for two households and supporting a family of five is high. I thought this would be a great way to save $1,500 per month. Besides, I work late into the night and usually arise about 5:30 a.m. No need to waste time commuting and spending money on a place where I don't intend to be spending much time. I came here to work, not sleep.  Watch video of Jason Chaffetz' life in Congress » . So I bought a cot at Smiths grocery store and carried it on a plane to Washington. I sleep in the closet by the door to the outside hall. The cot itself is fairly comfy. Best thing is there is no bar in the middle, so my back is doing quite well. The only downside is what is happening outside. The cleaning crew obviously works throughout the night. They do a great job, but they have a Zamboni-like machine (the kind you see on ice rinks) that cleans the hallways. It has a horn and they use it! It makes an obnoxious beeping sound that you hear on trucks that are backing up, and it definitely keeps me up at night. At 12:52 a.m. during the first week, the ""Capitol Early Warning System"" was tested. It works! Even though I sleep in my office, I do shower. The House has a gym. I pay $240 to use the facilities. Typically I head down first thing in the morning to wash up and work out in the evening. I thought it would be like a nice golf club or certainly as ""lavish"" as a Gold's Gym. Not so much. It's nice, but it's more like a high school gym with the small narrow lockers from the 1950s. I locker next to Jose Serrano (D-New York). On the political spectrum we are probably as far apart as possible. Yet, just in our gym clothes we get along great. He's a nice guy and he offered a wealth of perspective and suggestions to a freshman. Aside from the routine details of settling in, the first weeks of my term have been filled with surreal moments. Never did I think I would be seated just yards away from one of the most historic presidential inaugurations in the history of our country. To watch firsthand as President Bush peacefully transitioned the presidency to Barack Obama was a surreal and inspiring moment. My most vivid memory of the moment was watching the two men embrace after the oath of office (the first one). It's part of what makes this country so strong and so marvelous. In many ways, my own election reflected the miracle of this country. With no paid staff, no polling, no campaign office, no free meals for potential voters and no debt, I took on a 12-year Republican incumbent and won by a 20 percent margin (I ate one of our own) despite being outspent by $600,000 through the primary election. On January 6, 2009, I, too, raised my right hand and was administered the oath of office. With my 15-year old son, Max, by my side, tears flowed down my face. The emotion of the moment was overwhelming. The history of the House of Representatives, my desire to be the very best representative I can possibly be, the massive amount of people counting on us to do what is right, and the opportunity to do good all hit me at once. Over the past several weeks, the 22 Republican freshmen have been building our friendships. Our bond is tight, we are all working hard and we are having fun, too. This week, House Republicans met with President Obama and debated the stimulus bill. I voted against it. Our national debt has increased an average of $2.8 billion per day since January 2007. We must cut spending, not increase spending, for the long-term health of our economy. One day I went up to see my colleague Chris Lee's (R-New York) office. He's on the seventh floor of the Longworth Building and he had me crawl through the window in his office out to the balcony for a wonderful view of the Capitol. We talked about putting a barbecue out there in the summer and having the Republican freshman class over for some burgers. Being a member of Congress is nothing short of amazing, but the worst part is not being able to go home to my family at night. I miss my wife, Julie, and our kids, Max, Ellis, and Kate. They are in Utah and I am here in Washington four nights per week. It is an honor to serve. Now that we are settling in, the real work has begun. The noise in the hallway is the least of my problems. I've got my cot, now let's figure out how to get our economy back on track! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Chaffetz.","Jason Chaffetz: I decided to sleep in my House office to save money .

"(CNN) -- South Korea's Lee Jung-Su confirmed his reputation as the top men's short-track speedskater at the 2010 Winter Olympics with his second gold medal on Saturday night, while American Apolo Anton Ohno snatched a place in the history books with a last-gasp bronze. That thrilling 1,000-meter final capped an action-packed ninth day of the Vancouver Games, as Swiss ski-jumper Simon Ammann made history with his second gold medal and Americans Lindsey Vonn and Shani Davis missed out on double titles in skiing and speedskating. The U.S. still ended the day with a table-topping six gold medals, having failed to add to their tally, with Norway on five and South Korea joining Germany, Canada and Switzerland on four. Lee Jung-Su followed up his victory from the 1,500m event in an Olympic record time of one minute 23.747 seconds, with his compatriot Lee Ho-Suk winning silver in 1:23.801 to earn some consolation after being disqualified for causing a crash on the final lap of the longer race. Ohno (1:24.128 ) denied hosts Canada a medal when he surged past world record-holder Charles Hamelin (1:24.329 ) on the final lap to become the most decorated American Winter Olympian with a record-breaking seventh medal. The 27-year-old overhauled Bonnie Blair as his country's top medal winner, having won silver in the 1,500m. Hamelin's brother Francois finished last in the five-man final. Ski-jumping . Ammann became the first ski-jumper to win four individual gold medals at Winter Olympics when he leaped to victory in the large hill event at Whistler to follow up his normal hill title and match his feat at Salt Lake City in 2002. It was also the first time any ski-jumper has won both events twice, and made him Switzerland's most-decorated athlete in any Olympics, winter or summer. The 28-year-old, dubbed the ""Harry Potter of ski-jumping"" after his 2002 heroics due to his likeness to J.K. Rowling's boy wizard, smashed the Olympic record of 141 meters when he set a distance of 144m in his first round in the afternoon for a points total of 144.7. He then cleared 138m in the final round for a tally of 283.6 as he headed off normal hill silver medallist Adam Malyz of Poland by 15.3 points. Austria's Gregor Schlierenzauer picked up his second bronze medal to ensure the podium remained unchanged from last Saturday's event, finishing on 262.2 points. Alpine skiing . Andrea Fischbacher denied downhill champion Lindsey Vonn a double in women's alpine skiing speed events when she claimed a surprise victory in the super-G. The 24-year-old Fischbacher won Austria's second gold medal at the Vancouver Games after beating Vonn's time, with Slovenia's Tina Maze then pushing the American into the bronze position. Vonn, who crashed out super-combined, had gone top in the event -- which features gates spaced further apart than the giant slalom and slalom disciplines -- with a time of one minute 20.88 seconds. But Fischbacher trumped that in convincing style with a sizzling 1:20.14 and Maze then claimed her first Olympic medal with 1:20.63. Fischbacher had previously won only one World Cup event, a super-G two years ago. ""I was just thinking if I make a really good run and do my best I can beat her [Vonn],"" she told reporters. ""Everything was perfect and I skied really fast. It was a dream."" Vonn, the super-G World Cup champion for the past two seasons, indicated that she had been guilty of not going full-tilt for the entire run. ""I really attacked. I skied all those difficult sections really well. After I got passed those sections I kind of eased off the gas pedal,"" she said. Speedskating . The 27-year-old Davis, who became the first man to defend the 1,000-meter title on Wednesday, had to again settle for silver in the 1,500m event on Saturday as the U.S. team failed to add to a leading tally of six gold medals in 2010. Dutchman Mark Tuitert, who was fifth in the shorter event, claimed a shock gold as he set the fastest time of 1:45.57 to earn his first individual medal of any kind since winning silver in the 1,500m at the 2004 and 2005 world championships. Davis, the Turin 2006 runner-up, was 0.53 seconds adrift while Norway's long-distance specialist Havard Bokko took the bronze. China's Zhou Yang claimed the women's 1,500-meter short-track gold medal after setting an Olympic record time in the final. Zhou clocked 2:16.993 to comfortably head off South Koreans Lee Eun-Byul and Park Seung-Hi in second and third respectively. Cross-country skiing . Marcus Hellner gave Sweden a second gold medal in the cross-country skiing program, and third overall, winning the men's 30-kilometer pursuit title to follow up compatriot Charlotte Kalla's triumph in the ladies' 10 km free event on Monday. The 24-year-old's time of one hour 15 minutes 11.4 seconds put him just 2.1 seconds ahead of Germany's Tobias Angerer, who was also runner-up at the 2007 world championships. Johan Olsson claimed a bronze for Sweden to add to his relay third-placing at the 2006 Turin Games, finishing 2.8 seconds behind Hellner. Ice hockey . Switzerland defeated Norway 5-4 in overtime to move into third place in Group A of the men's ice hockey competition. Romano Lemm scored nearly two-and-half-minutes into extra time to leave Norway bottom with three defeats from three despite a hat-trick on Saturday from Tore Vikingstad. First-placed United States will take on second-placed Canada on Sunday to decide the group, with the winner receiving a bye into the quarterfinal stage. In the women's competition, Switzerland crushed China 6-0 as Stefanie Marty scored four goals.","NEW: Lee Jung-Su confirms his reputation as top men's short-track speedskater .

"(CNN) -- A male suicide bomber dressed in women's clothing killed three members of Somalia's U.N.-backed interim government and 16 others Thursday when he detonated at a medical school graduation ceremony in Mogadishu, government officials and witnesses said. The Transitional Federal Government said Education Minister Abdullahi Wayel, Health Minister Qamar Aden and Higher Education Minister Ibrahim Hassan Adow were among the dead after the bomber attacked Banadir University's medical school commencement. The African Union, which leads a peacekeeping mission in Somalia, put the death toll at 19. The victims also included nine students and two doctors, according to a professor at Banadir University, while journalists said two of their colleagues died in the blast. In addition, Sports Minister Suleman Olad Roble was hospitalized in critical condition, his relatives told local media. Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed blamed the Islamist rebel group Al-Shabaab for the attack and displayed what he said was the body of the bomber for reporters, a local journalist who attended the news conference told CNN. The body the president displayed had a beard. The president also showed the remains of the suicide belt and shreds of a hijab -- a garment worn by some Muslim women to reflect modesty -- at the news conference, according to the journalist, whom CNN is not naming for security reasons. At the United Nations, the Security Council condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism against ""people dedicated to building a peaceful, stable and prosperous future for the people of Somalia."" It urged a ""thorough investigation"" and expressed hope that those responsible would ""be brought swiftly to justice."" ""The Security Council expresses its deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed and to those injured in the attack, as well as to the Transitional Federal Government and the people of Somalia,"" the council's current president, Burkina Faso's U.N. Ambassador Michel Kafando, said Thursday. Video of the graduation ceremony showed Dr. Osman Dufle, the country's former health minister, speaking as the camera begins to shake -- apparently from the explosion. Afterward, Dufle told journalists that he saw a person dressed in black moving through the audience just before the blast, according to the Radio Mogadishu journalist. Al-Shabaab is made up of former allies of Ahmed, once a leader of the Islamist movement that briefly held power in Mogadishu in 2006. Adow, a Somali-American, served as the foreign secretary of the Islamic Courts Union when it held Mogadishu. But while Ahmed and other former members of the ICU accepted a U.N.-brokered peace agreement with the government they once fought, Al-Shabaab -- which the United States says has links to al Qaeda -- has rejected the peace agreement and has waged a bloody campaign against the transitional government. The African Union's peacekeeping mission AMISOM condemned Thursday's attack. It vowed to ""spare no efforts to ensure that the perpetrators of this act and such heinous crimes against humanity being carried out in Somalia"" will be brought to justice. The journalists killed were Mohamed Amiin Abdullah of Shabelle Media Network and freelance cameraman Hassan Ahmed Hagi, who worked closely with the network. CNN regularly works with Shabelle Media. The African Union condemned the attack, saying it would ""spare no efforts to ensure that perpetrators of this act and such heinous crimes against humanity being carried out in Somalia"" will be brought to justice. The National Union of Somali Journalists also condemned the attack and said it brought the number of journalists killed in the country this year to eight. CNN's Ben Brumfield and journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.","Three government ministers, two journalists, two professors and nine students among 19 killed .

"(Skiing Magazine) -- Picture this: You're charging down a course at 80 mph. The world whips by you in a blur. You catch an edge, smack into a gate and somersault into the safety nets, cracking your neck and shredding a knee. Season? Done. Olympic dreams? Over. Career? Definitely on hold, possibly kaput. That's what happened in December to TJ Lanning, one of the U.S. Ski Team's top racers, during a downhill race at Canada's Lake Louise. He's one of many international Alpine competitors sidelined this winter because of season-ending injuries. Other casualties include 2009 downhill champ Canadian John Kucera and French slalom star Jean-Baptiste Grange. Addressing the rash of early-season injuries, Aksel Lund Svindval, the 2009 men's overall World Cup winner, posted the following on his blog in December: ""In two weeks of intense World Cup racing in North America, racers have sustained the following ... 7 torn ACLS, 4 knee ligaments, 1 broken arm, 1 broken leg, 1 broken neck, 1 concussion, 1 dislocated knee, 1 dislocated shoulder .. is this OK?"" Sure, ski racing has always been a dangerous sport, but with ever-evolving gear and technologies creating faster and faster competitors, the incidence of injuries has spiked. Skiing Magazine: Jamaica's Olympic skier, ready for glory . The International Ski Federation (known as FIS), the World Cup governing body, launched the ""Injury Surveillance System"" in 2006 to track facts and figures on injury patterns across all disciplines: Nordic, freestyle and Alpine. Among Alpine racers, knee injuries are the most common affliction. As a part of this initiative, in December FIS convened a panel of six top Alpine competitors, including Didier Cuche, Scott Macartney, and Svindal, to drill down on how to make racing safer. They cited course preparation, improved take-off points for jumps, flat landings and medical procedures as top concerns. Skiing Magazine: French Olympic uniforms: Really pink . The athletes also made a plea for redesigned gates, ones that would rip off more easily upon impact. In Lanning's accident, they say this would have significantly reduced his injuries and their severity. While competitors want to increase safety, they're also aware that it's the danger, blood and guts of their sport that turn fans on, and athletes are wary of ratcheting down the visceral appeal. When it comes to modifying race procedures, FIS is adamant about using systematic data collection and scientific analysis to make informed decisions. In January, FIS rolled out a new, three-year scientific study to analyze Alpine racing safety and to make recommendations on how to decrease the number of injuries. The first phase will collect information through interviews with athletes, coaches and equipment providers, among other experts, to gather suggestions for short-term prevention solutions. Subsequent stages will focus on prevention strategies and rule changes. However, some modifications were deemed urgent enough to institute immediately: smaller jumps and new gates with flags that rip way upon contact. FIS works closely with the Vancouver Organizing Committee to design the Alpine courses at the Olympics, but ultimately, it's VANOC that sets them  -- save the downhill, which FIS still oversees; it's an old, complicated tradition. With fog rising from Whistler Mountain during the downhill training runs, making visibility next to none, officials were scrambling to re-design the race gates in an effort to make them more visible, switching the flag color from green to red. With this last-minute change, officials on the ground weren't sure if the new, FIS-sanctioned gates would be in place during the Winter Games.

"(CNN)  -- It's a trip that would make Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher blush. On Friday, the Carnival cruise ship Elation, sponsored by the world's largest nonprofit singles travel group, will make history by hosting the world's first International Cougar Cruise, and we don't mean the animal. Defined by the Urban Dictionary, a cougar is ""an older woman who frequents clubs in order to score with a much younger man."" It can be anyone from ""an overly surgically altered wind tunnel victim, to an absolute sad and bloated old horn-meister."" ""A cougar is generally known as a woman over 40 who likes to date younger men, but theoretically any woman who dates younger men is a cougar,"" said Rich Gosse, who came up with the cougar cruise idea. The ship, which sets sail from San Diego, California, to Ensenada, Mexico, for three nights, is booked for 300 guests and even has a waiting list. The ship has three swimming pools, a seven-deck-high atrium, bar and grill, a Moroccan-inspired Casablanca Casino and a lounge that features stage shows, according to Ann Thomas, owner of the Singles Travel Company and organizer of the Cougar Cruise. After making port in Ensenada, the cruise offers extracurricular activities like horseback riding, ATVing and other outdoor excursions. ""There's at least four or five options a day for people to get together on the cruise. We're doing lots of activities; dancing, dining, Jacuzzi parties, karaoke for two hours. And starting at $125 a ticket, it's a great price,"" Thomas said. ""I've had to hire two more people part-time just to pick up the phones,"" she said. ""I've never seen a response quite like this."" Thomas admits that she was hesitant to sign on to the idea but is glad she did. ""We have people flying in from Italy and Denmark. My associates have been booking from France, Canada. It's fascinating,"" Thomas said. Gosse, who has been hosting singles events for more than 30 years, said he got the idea after hosting a cougar convention in Palo Alto, California. ""We had to turn away hundreds of people,"" Gosse said. ""Then we did one in Beverly Hills and had a massive crowd down there, so I thought, maybe we should do a cougar cruise. I didn't think anyone would want to go. Needless to say, the phone is ringing off the hook."" These cougars may as well be an endangered species compared with those hunting them on this cruise. ""The basic problem is, we have is too many cubs,"" Gosse said. ""We usually have too many women and not enough guys, but there's been a paradigm shift in recent years, so now the cubs are more excited about it than the cougars."" A ""cub"" is someone in their 20s or early 30s who likes to date older women, according to Gosse. For years, he says, it's been socially acceptable for older men to date younger women. But in recent years, a phenomenon sparked by celebrities like Kutcher, baseball player Alex Rodriguez (who is said to have dated pop star Madonna) and others has led a new generation of younger men on the prowl for more experienced partners. There is even an ABC sitcom called ""Cougar Town"" that glamorizes the sexual escapades of a 40-something divorcee on a search for self-discovery by dating younger men. ""Tim Robbins [and] Susan Sarandon was the first high-profile cougar-cub relationship,"" Gosse said of the actors, who have been together since the late 1980s. ""Now we're seeing a paradigm shift where these younger guys are actively looking for older women."" ""If you look at the demographics, the only logical way for people to get their needs met is for younger men to date older women,"" he said. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, for every 100 single women in their 20s in America, there are 118 single men in their 20s. The reason, Gosse said, is that young women are dating older guys. ""When you're single, you always wish the person meets someone they want to be with. If this is something they want, then I wish them well,"" Thomas said.","Cruise for women who date younger men sets sail on Carnival cruise ship Elation .

"(CNN) -- Only moments after Tiger Woods began reading his apology Friday, writers, pundits and tweeters largely split into two camps: those who felt that his words were a heartfelt effort to acknowledge wrongs and set them right, and those who didn't believe a word of it. David Hinckley, in the New York Daily News, was unconvinced: ""Prisoners of war reading prepared denunciations of Western imperialism look more comfortable than Tiger Woods did Friday, apologizing for his 'selfish and irresponsible' behavior. Never relaxed and easygoing in front of a TV camera in the best of times, Woods was a man saying the right things out loud while everything about his demeanor was silently screaming, 'I don't want to be here.' His eyes occasionally moving around the room as he worked to enunciate his scripted remarks clearly, Woods looked like a man who had caught his leg in a bear trap."" By contrast, SI.com's Michael Rosenberg took Tiger at his word: ""This was a real person with real flaws and real failures that he really acknowledged. Tiger has always preferred to sell an image instead of being himself; this was obvious even before he crashed his car last Thanksgiving. Ironically, at the moment when Tiger's image is most at risk, he finally showed us who he is. ... A lot of us have trouble apologizing to our spouse or our boss when we make a mistake. Think about what it must be like to apologize to the world. I don't know what else people can ask of the guy."" At beliefnet.com, Rabbi Schmuley Boteach was convinced that the apology was heartfelt: ""Tiger Woods' statement was a model of repentance and contrition. He admitted he had a problem. He said that words alone would not solve it, that he requires, and is receiving counseling. He admitted that celebrity and money had given him a sense of entitlement and had corrupted him. He said he had behaved selfishly and irresponsibly. He accepted that being a public figure meant private responsibility and that he had to model good behavior for the youth. And he looked the entire time like he meant it. It was that rarest of things, a sincere and unconditional statement of contrition and responsibility from a public figure for cheating on his wife."" ESPN.com's Bill Simmons called the apology ""a borderline train wreck"" and said: ""It amazes me that Tiger learned little to nothing from the past two months. The control freak whose life slipped out of control dipped right back into control-freak mode, reading a prepared speech in front of a hand-selected audience of people, taking no questions, talking in clichés and only occasionally seeming human. Everything about it seemed staged. Everything. When the main camera broke down at the nine-minute mark and Tiger had to be shown from the side, I half-expected to see that he was plugged in to the wall."" CNN legal analyst Lisa Bloom had a different take, saying that while Tiger Woods hit a ""home run"" in acknowledging that he had a mistaken view of what his fame entitled him to, the most significant thing about the apology was the absence of his wife, Elin: ""Elin Woods joins the more recent and growing list -- Elizabeth Edwards, Jenny Sanford -- who stand out for not standing by their husbands' public confessionals. Famous wives are public figures themselves, however reluctantly, and serve as role models for girls and women who watch their moves carefully. Elin's absence says this: I am not a doormat. Nor should you be. She may forgive, or not; she may stay, or not. That's her private business. But she refused to be part of the public spectacle... And that is as it should be."" Mary McNamara, at the Los Angeles Times, wondered why Woods bothered to make the statement, saying it just ""reignited"" the news cycle: ""... it would have been nice if Woods had seemed more genuine -- the only real emotion he seemed to be experiencing was anger at the media, and a general air of irritated resignation at having to make this statement in the first place. Which, of course, he did not. The world would have gone on turning without a prepared statement from Tiger Woods. But unless Woods is planning to retire, to embrace a truly private life, then going out there with a 'I'm saying this and then I'm not saying anything more' is just ridiculous and disingenuous."" Taking more of the middle ground, Washington Post media columnist Howard Kurtz, who hosts ""Reliable Sources"" on CNN, said on the Post's site: ""It's not too much to say that this is a man in pain -- self-inflicted, to be sure, but pain nonetheless. But putting the tawdriness of the multiple mistresses behind him will probably take more than one carefully controlled television appearance."" iReport: Share your views on Woods' apology . Even before the apology, there was a bounty of opinion arguing that it wasn't a good idea. The pseudonymous ""Stanley Bing"" at Fortune.com begged Tiger not to apologize in this blog post: . ""This nation is an apology factory. People are held up to impossible standards, or even possible ones, and fail to live up to them, as people will, and then the apology machine goes into action and will not shut down again until it runs its course, or is denied of fuel. You are simply giving it more fuel. ... I hope I'm not too late. You're scheduled to apologize again this morning. Perhaps you won't get this advice until it's too late. If so, you know what? It's still good. You can't unapologize now. But let that be it, forever. Answer no more questions. Say you're sorry, if necessary, to the one person to whom you genuinely owe an apology. No, it's not Barbara Walters."" And Selena Roberts, at SI.com, faulted Woods for stealing the spotlight from U.S. athletes at the Winter Olympics who were getting well-earned recognition: . ""The Americans have earned their enthusiasm, and all the coverage and headlines that go with it. Now Tiger wants to eclipse their sunshine by crashing their bash with his own pity party. ... The days of seeing the Americans through the prism of Olympians Behaving Badly have seemed a scene of the past at these Games. Then Tiger, the nation's gold-medal bad boy, surfaces, demanding equal time. Once again, Tiger couldn't help himself."" CNN contributor Roland Martin said he wasn't looking for an apology: ""I'm sick of these sanctimonious folks who are blabbering about Woods needing to be grilled about his private behavior. Look, Tiger Woods didn't cheat on me. He's not my daddy, brother, cousin, church member, neighbor or friend. He didn't let me down or crush my view of him. He is not and never was my role model.""","Tiger Woods apologized Friday and said he was working on repairing damage he caused .

"Montevideo, Uruguay (CNN) -- A court sentenced former Uruguayan President Juan Maria Bordaberry to 30 years in prison on Wednesday for the coup that consolidated his power in 1973 and for human rights violations. Judge Mariana Mota convicted Bordaberry of violating the constitution, nine counts of ""forced disappearance"" and two counts of political homicide. Bordaberry, 81, had already been under house arrest since 2007 for the killings of two opposition legislators in 1976. Bordaberry assumed office in 1972 following an election that has since been questioned. In 1973, he backed a military coup that kept him in power, and dissolved congress and suspended the country's constitution. The military pushed him out in favor of another leader in 1976.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama's accusations that Iran's nuclear program runs afoul of international agreements are ""baseless,"" the Islamic republic's president told CNN's Larry King on Friday. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says President Obama's accusations are ""baseless."" ""We did not expect Mr. Obama within less than 48 hours, to basically violate the commitment that he spoke of at the United Nations,"" said President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The Iranian leader was referring to Obama's Wednesday speech to the U.N. General Assembly, where Obama called for international unity in attacking the world's challenges. Asked if he was expressing disappointment in the U.S. president, Ahmadinejad responded, ""We simply didn't expect him to say something that was ... was baseless."" Earlier Friday evening Obama said ""Iran is on notice"" regarding its nuclear efforts, and that the international community is united in its opposition to Tehran's nuclear program. ""They are going to have to make a choice: Are they willing to go down the path to greater prosperity and security for Iran, giving up the acquisition of nuclear weapons ... or will they continue down a path that is going to lead to confrontation,"" he said at a news conference at the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Obama's comments came hours after Iran acknowledged the existence of a second uranium enrichment facility and ahead of next week's planned meeting between Iran and the five permanent United Nations Security Council members, plus Germany. The October 1 meeting will take place in Geneva, Switzerland. Obama said he would not speculate on any course of action absent a satisfactory response from Iran. ""Even countries who a year ago or six months ago might have been reluctant to even discuss things like sanctions,"" are starting to become concerned, Obama said. Obama said his ""preferred course of action is to resolve this in a diplomatic fashion. It's up to the Iranians to respond."" The U.S. president said the conclusions about Iran's nuclear ambitions came as a result of the work of three intelligence agencies -- those of Britain, France and the United States. The work, Obama said, was done ""to make sure that we were absolutely confident about the situation there."" The United States has known about the unfinished site since the Bush administration, according to senior U.S. officials who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the negotiations. French intelligence officials were also aware of the facility for several months at least, a U.S. diplomatic source said. It wasn't until Monday that Iran wrote a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency, revealing the existence of the underground facility on a military base near the Shia Muslim holy city of Qom. The facility is thought to be capable of housing 3,000 centrifuges, which is not enough to produce nuclear fuel to power a reactor but is sufficient to manufacture bomb-making material, according to a U.S. diplomatic source who read the letter. Iran told the IAEA there is no nuclear material at the site, an agency spokesman said. Once Iran alerted the IAEA, Obama began sharing U.S. intelligence on the nuclear site with allies, particularly with Russia and China in an effort to get those countries on board with new sanctions against Iran, the officials said. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed Friday that Iran admitted the existence of the ""new pilot fuel enrichment plant,"" prompting Obama, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to respond at the G-20 economic summit. ""Iran's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the nonproliferation regime,"" Obama said, with Brown and Sarkozy standing at his side.  Watch world leaders react to Iran » . Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did not mention the Qom plant during his visit to New York this week for the U.N. General Assembly sessions. He reiterated earlier claims that Iran has fully cooperated with nuclear inspectors. He emphasized this again Friday afternoon at a news conference, where he said Iran complied with IAEA regulations requiring it be informed at least six months before an enrichment facility becomes operational. ""We still have a year left before that six months kicks in,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""I thought we were supposed to be encouraged for taking this action,"" he said.  Watch Ahmadinejad hit back at Obama » . Iran's revelation of a new nuclear site could actually ""strengthen their hand"" as Tehran heads into next week's talks, according to Paul Ingram, an analyst who studies Iran and nuclear nonproliferation. ""It will be seen as an indication that they are willing to play by the rules,"" said Ingram, the executive director of the British American Security Information Council in London, England. He said the timing of Iran's revelation, between the U.N. General Assembly sessions and the October 1 meeting, is deliberate on Iran's part. ""This will make it more difficult to persuade them to abandon enrichment,"" Ingram said. Iran claims its nuclear enrichment program is intended for peaceful purposes, but the international community accuses it of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons capability. iReport.com: Dissidents discuss Iran enrichment plants . Iran had acknowledged only a uranium enrichment plant in Natanz, which nuclear inspectors visited recently. Iran also has an unfinished nuclear research reactor in Arak, and U.N. nuclear inspectors were allowed access to that facility this month. Other important nuclear sites in Iran include its Bushehr nuclear power plant and the Isfahan uranium conversion plant.  Map: Iran's nuclear sites » . Washington became aware of the covert facility near Qom several years ago, but a clearer picture about the facility emerged later, a U.S. counter-proliferation official said. The enrichment facility would probably not be operational for another year, the official said. The official said the newly unveiled facility ""doesn't really change the baseline"" conclusion of the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, which concluded that Iran could manufacture a nuclear weapons between 2010 and 2015. The official added that there are suspicions about other possible hidden or undeclared nuclear-related facilities.

"(CNN)  -- A pop star could have a quickie Vegas wedding tomorrow, to a man she meets tonight, if she so chooses. Scott Peterson, convicted of the murder of his pregnant wife and on death row, has an inalienable right to a prison wedding with a female pen pal if the mood strikes him. Indiana grandmother Linda Wolfe holds the Guinness World Records title for most marriages: 23. One lasted just 36 hours. She's on the lookout for No. 24, and when she finds him, no law can stop her from marrying him. The U.S. Supreme Court has held unanimously that ""the freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men. Marriage is one of the basic civil rights of man."" So basic, so important, so fundamental, in constitutional parlance, that no state can interfere with even the most reckless heterosexual nuptials. Yet in most states, my friends Wilbert and Carlos, ""free men"" together 16 years and lovingly raising a son, are shut out of the 1,100 federal and hundreds of state legal benefits that come with marriage. These include the right to visit a spouse in a hospital and make medical decisions; employer sick and bereavement leave; inheritance rights; the right to give unlimited gifts to a spouse without gift tax; disability, pension, and Social Security benefits; the right to bring a wrongful death case; the right to refuse to testify against a spouse; or the right to prevent the deportation of a foreign-born partner by marriage, among others. Perhaps most poignant, and often lost in this debate, are children in same-sex families: kids like my friends' son Dorian, growing up with the sting of knowing that his parents are second-class citizens in their own country. Study after study finds that something about marriage makes us live longer, healthier lives. Married folks have significantly better mental health, engage in fewer risky behaviors, eat healthier, have less illness and are just plain happier. And don't tell me that civil unions are exactly the same as marriage. If that's true, then let's let gays and lesbians pick first. If they pick marriage, and heterosexuals are relegated to civil unions, no problem, right, since they are exactly the same? The trial challenging Proposition 8,  the law that bans same-sex marriage in California, started Monday in San Francisco. This will be the first federal trial in U.S. history in which testimony will be heard and recorded about the harm to gay and lesbian citizens caused by laws like Prop 8. iReport: Is Prop 8 constitutional? Share your view . As a civil rights lawyer for 23 years, there is no question at all in my mind that as a matter of constitutional law, the federal court must strike down any law that creates a subclass of Americans, shutting them out of legal privileges and protections available to others, merely because they are gay. Demeaning and disrespecting gay people is a constitutional affront. Seven years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down Lawrence v. Texas, the gay community's Brown v. Board of Education, striking down state laws that criminalized private, consensual gay sex, saying: ""The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The state cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime."" When all the testimony about legal rights, benefits and protections in the Prop 8 trial is said and done, Perry v. Schwarzenegger is ultimately about just that. Our gay and lesbian friends and neighbors are entitled to respect for their private lives, and the state cannot demean their existence, even by majority vote. Seven out of 10 Americans supported laws banning interracial marriage at the time our president's black father and white mother married. But the Supreme Court knew that our federal Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the law was a bedrock American principle that sometimes requires the courts to lead, and so lead they did, striking down antimiscegenation laws in 1967. Now, only lunatic-fringe bigots would support those laws. My favorite anti-Prop 8 placard read: ""When do I get to vote on your marriage?""  Same-sex marriage may be a politically volatile and complex issue, but as a matter of federal constitutional law, it's simple: Fundamental rights must be granted equally across the board to all American citizens. Equal means equal. The rest, constitutionally speaking, is just noise. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lisa Bloom.","Lisa Bloom: Heterosexuals may marry in jail, after one-night stands, many times over .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Heavy flooding in central Mexico in the past week has killed at least 33 people and left thousands homeless, the government said Monday. Schools remained closed in five cities in Mexico's Michoacan state, where the flooding has killed at least 22 people and left more than 3,500 residents homeless, the state government said on its Web site. Another 83 people still were missing Monday in Michoacan, a state in western coastal Mexico that has been beset by drug violence in the past few years. A mudslide Saturday killed at least 11 people near the small town of Temascaltepec, in neighboring Mexico state. Uncharacteristic heavy rain throughout Mexico also has led to flooding in the nation's capital, Mexico City. Up to 35,000 people nationwide could have been affected, published reports said. On Sunday, Mexican President Felipe Calderon toured Valle de Chalco, a city in Mexico state. In Valle de Chalco, on the eastern outskirts of the Mexico City area, officials announced that contaminated water from a sewage network that overflowed Friday will continue to flood the town for at least another 48 hours. The number of affected houses in the city grew from 2,000 on Friday to about 3,000 on Monday, the government said. Mexico state is bordered on the west by Michoacan and adjoins Mexico City on three sides -- north, east and west. In Mexico City, officials announced the reopening Monday of 165 of the 174 schools that were closed Friday because of the heavy rain and flooding.

"(CNN)  -- Polish goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski made two sorry blunders as Arsenal crashed to a 2-1 defeat in their Champions League last 16 clash against Porto at Estadio do Dragao. Fabianski, standing in for the injured Manuel Almunia saw a soft shot go past him for Porto's opener. Comeback defender Sol Campbell quickly leveled for Arsenal but it was his back-pass which was picked up by Fabianski to concede a free kick which led to Porto's winner in the second half. Porto were ahead after just 11 minutes as he was horribly caught out of position by a low right wing cross cum shot from Silvestre Varela which deflected off his diving body and over the line. In an open game, Arsenal were quickly level as Thomas Vermaelen and then Tomas Rosicky worked a Samir Nasri corner to Campbell who headed home from close range on 16 minutes. It was Campbell's first goal for Arsenal since the 2006 Champions League final. Fabianski mixed brilliance with his mistakes as he did well to keep out a fine shot from Micael on 29 minutes. Arsenal thought they should have had a penalty when Tomas Rosicky was pulled down, but soon afterwards they found themselves behind again. Hesitancy between Campbell and Fabianski led to the keeper picking up the ball just inside the penalty area. With Campbell still debating the decision, claiming it was not a deliberate back-pass, Porto took the free-kick immediately - which Micael quickly tapped to Falcao for the Colombian to roll the ball into an empty net. Porto pressed hard for a third ahead of the second leg in London but Arsenal held out to limit their losses. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger accused referee Martin Hansson of a ""massive mistake"" after his side's defeat. ""I believe it (the back-pass) was accidental, Sol touched it accidentally,"" Wenger told ITV1. ""And the referee should give us time to build the wall."" In the other last 16 clash on Wednesday, Bayern Munich clinched a 2-1 win over 10-man Fiorentina in the Allianz Arena. Arjen Robben put the Bundesliga side ahead with a penalty just before halftime, but Per Kroldrup gave the Italian visitors a deserved equalizer five minutes into the second half. Referee Tom Henning Ovrebro, who took charge of the controversial semifinal between champions Barcelona and Chelsea last season, was in the spotlight again as he controversially sent off Fiorentina's Massimo Gobbi for an apparently innocuous tackle. Miroslav Klose, who many deemed fortunate to stay on the field for a more robust challenge, then headed home a late Bayern winner with Fiorentina claiming he was offside.","Lucasz Fabianski blunders led to both Porto goals in their 2-1 home win over Arsenal .

"(CNN) -- Pennsylvania and the nation said goodbye Tuesday to John P. Murtha, politician, warrior, father, friend, gentleman. Speakers at the funeral for the Democratic congressman recalled a man skilled in the ways of Washington but, more importantly, a public servant who never forgot why he was elected 17 times to represent Pennsylvania's 12th district. ""Jack Murtha never lost sight of God's purpose in the law,"" said the Rev. William George, president of the Georgetown Preparatory School in Washington. ""Lawmaking should be sacred work, and Jack knew that."" Murtha, 77, died February 8 of complications from gall bladder surgery. A former Marine colonel and twice-wounded Vietnam War veteran, Murtha earned a reputation as one of Congress's loudest anti-war voices. He initially supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but he stunned much of Washington when he called for a swift U.S. pullout in November 2005. ""U.S. and coalition troops have done all they can,"" Murtha said. ""It's time for a change in direction."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who led a bipartisan delegation to the funeral, remembered her long-time ally. ""Those who served with him were honored to call him a colleague,"" Pelosi said. ""There were those of us who were privileged to call him friend."" President Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates were among those who filled Westmont Presbyterian Church in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, for the funeral. Murtha's daughter, Donna, recalled his love of nature and how he enjoyed feeding wild birds, but not squirrels that raided the birdseed. ""He loved to outwit the squirrels,"" Donna Murtha said, her voice breaking at times. ""He could not stand it if they were outwitting him."" Others recalled Murtha's dedication to public service. ""Today there is great comfort in the memory of John P. Murtha's life,"" said the Rev. Douglas Stevens, pastor of Westmont Presbyterian. ""He made a difference."" Murtha underwent scheduled laparoscopic surgery to remove his gall bladder January 28 at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He was released but rehospitalized a few days later after the complications developed. The operation had been scheduled after Murtha was hospitalized for a few days in December. Murtha represented Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District in the House since 1974, making him the chamber's eighth most senior member. Two days before he died, Murtha became the state's longest-serving congressman. He also was the first Vietnam War combat veteran elected to Congress, his biography on the House Web site says. Murtha was considered one of ""the kings of pork"" on Capitol Hill by taxpayer watchdog groups for requesting tens of millions of dollars in earmarks. The congressman strongly defended earmarks, saying on his Web site, ""I believe that elected representatives of the people understand their constituents and districts best."" Supporters said his efforts helped bring thousands of jobs to western Pennsylvania. Born June 17, 1932, in West Virginia, Murtha moved with his family to Pennsylvania as a child. Prior to joining the House of Representatives, he served in the Pennsylvania state legislature. He also served 37 years in the Marines and Marine Corps Reserves. He retired from the Reserves in 1990 and received the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. Murtha attended Washington and Jefferson College but dropped out in 1952 to enlist in the Marines. He later graduated from the University of Pittsburgh. He is survived by his wife, Joyce, daughter, Donna, and two sons. ""When they made dad, they broke the mold,"" Donna Murtha said during the funeral. ""He lived by the motto, one man can make a difference."" Murtha was scheduled to be buried later Tuesday at a private ceremony.","John Murtha elected 17 times to represent Pennsylvania's 12th district .

"(CNN)  -- An early-morning hazardous material spill has been contained, but officials in Morehead City, North Carolina have closed its port and recommended evacuation of its downtown area after nine containers of high-explosive materials were punctured. The incident occurred when a forklift unloading a vessel punctured a large container and the drums inside it that contained the explosive compound PETN, said Morehead City Police spokeswoman Amy Thompson. PETN was allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, accused of trying to set off an explosion aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 as it approached Detroit, Michigan, on December 25. PETN is a highly explosive organic compound belonging to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin. Thompson quoted Morehead City Fire Chief Wes Lail as saying the entire cleanup is a five-step process, and only the first step had been completed. There have been no injuries or any environmental damage, according to Carteret County officials. Some residents and business workers left the area, but Tompson said she didn't know how many. ""Right now our advice to everybody is if they're uncomfortable staying in downtown Morehead, to evacuate further west. And if they choose to stay home, stay away from windows and doors,"" Mayor Jerry Jones told CNN. ""Don't get out and sightsee and meander around. It is dangerous, and we need to ensure the safety of our public. As the day goes on and we feel like we have more information, we will pass that information on."" He said that emergency management officials ""feel that everything is contained."" But at the early stages in the cleanup, they advised keeping people from getting closed to the port. Carteret County officials said U.S. 70 will be closed from 4th Street in Morehead City to the Morehead-Beaufort high-rise bridge for most of the day. The Coast Guard has barred traffic to and from the zone. The Coast Guard captain of the port ordered the facility closed and a 300-yard safety zone has been established to exclude any vessels operating any closer. Jones said the port called the city before 4:45 a.m. ET to say that a product spilled out of drums on the port property. ""We immediately identified it was a hazardous material, assessed that it was contained on the port and not (going) to go into our neighboring waters, into the waterway,"" he said. Police, fire and explosive ordnance crews from nearby Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point arrived at the scene, and an incident command center was set up nearby. Jones confirmed that the material in the containers is PETN, allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, accused of trying to bomb Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in Amsterdam on December 25. PETN is a high explosive organic compound belonging to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin. Jones said PETN is a crystal packaged in water for stability. He said the people who transport ""any highly flammable explosive devices"" have to and did notify the port and local emergency and police officials. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Chris O'Neil said the substance has industrial and medical uses. ""Being an international port, we handle highly flammable explosive material all the time. Jet fuel comes through here all the time, gasoline, propane. So it's not unusual to have explosive material coming through Morehead City,"" he said. Also responding were the U.S. Customs and the Salvation Army.","NEW: Cleanup is a five-step process, and only the first step is completed, authorities say .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Scientists in the United States are developing a ""synthetic tree"" capable of collecting carbon around 1,000 times faster than the real thing. A conceptual design of how the ""synthetic tree"" might look should they ever reach the stage of production. As the wind blows though plastic ""leaves,"" the carbon is trapped in a chamber, compressed and stored as liquid carbon dioxide. The technology is similar to that used to capture carbon from flue stacks at coal-fired power plants, but the difference is that the ""synthetic tree"" can catch carbon anytime, anywhere. ""Half of your emissions come from small, distributed sources where collection at the site is either impossible or impractical,"" said Professor Klaus Lackner, Ewing-Worzel Professor of Geophysics in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering at Columbia University. ""We aim for applications like gasoline in cars or jet fuel in airplanes. We are going after CO2 that otherwise is nearly impossible to collect,"" he told CNN. While the idea of carbon-catchers may sound far-fetched, an early model has been built and Lackner is in the process of writing a proposal for consideration by the U.S. Department of Energy. He personally explained the concept in a 45-minute meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last month at a three-day symposium on climate change in London. ""He was there and I was there and he showed interest,"" Lackner told CNN. ""That's exciting, but I don't particularly want to discuss this in a public forum because I think this gives me a little bit of an opportunity to tailor my proposals to the Department of Energy in a way that makes them more palatable."" Lackner started working on the concept of an ambient carbon catcher in 1998. ""I argued back then and I still argue that the reason this can be done, from a theoretical point of view, is that the CO2 in the air is actually surprisingly concentrated, therefore the device you need to collect CO2 is quite small."" The ""synthetic tree"" looks more like a public convenience block than a hi-tech method of reducing carbon emissions, but Lackner told CNN it is highly efficient for its size when compared, for example, to a modern power-generating wind turbine. ""If you give me one of those big windmills which have those big areas through which the rotor moves -- how much CO2 can I avoid? And if I had an equally sized CO2 collector -- how much CO2 can I collect? It turns out the collector is several hundred times better than the windmill."" Is the ""synthetic tree"" an interesting alternative, or a  scientific flight of fancy that's unlikely to happen? Sound Off below. Lackner told CNN that initial concerns over the cost of the technology were focused on the ""front-end"" carbon collector, including the sorbent used to catch the carbon dioxide in the air. But after years of research, Lackner told CNN he and his colleagues have developed a sorbent that is ""close to the ideal,"" in that it uses a relatively small amount of energy to release the CO2 and is not prohibitively expensive. ""By the time we make liquid CO2 we have spent approximately 50 kilojoules [of electricity] per mole of CO2."" Compare that, Lackner said, to the average power plant in the U.S. which produces one mole of CO2 with every 230 kilojoules of electricity. ""In other words, if we simply plugged our device in to the power grid to satisfy its energy needs, for every roughly 1000 kilograms [of carbon dioxide] we collected we would re-emit 200, so 800 we can chalk up as having been successful,"" he said. Lackner told CNN the biggest cost was at the ""back-end"" of the collector, primarily the technology used to release the CO2 from the sorbent. He said for that reason, on a cost-basis, the ""synthetic tree"" could not compete with modern coal-fired power plants that are designed to release fewer carbon emissions than their older predecessors. But he said when compared to the cost of retro-fitting an existing coal plant, the ""synthetic tree"" becomes more viable. ""The bottom line is we have in this way the ability to deal with the problem at a cost which is somewhat higher than on a coal-fired power plant retro-fit, but not much higher."" Besides, he said, the technology is not being developed as an alternative to the carbon capture and storage methods currently being tested for large-scale use on coal-fired power stations. He's targeting carbon that's already in the air. The concept of the ""synethic tree"" has caught the imagination of one of the first scientists to warn the world about global warming, Lackner's colleague at Columbia University, Newberry Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Professor Wally Broecker. ""I'm extremely excited about this. I think this is something that the world's going to have to have, unfortunately,"" Broecker told CNN from Madrid where he received a BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award for his work on the issue of climate change. Broecker told CNN most people still don't recognize the magnitude of the task the world faces in reducing global carbon emissions, and it was likely that one day urgent action would need to be taken, above and beyond the current measures being discussed. ""We're probably not going to stop CO2 rising until it's double what it was near-1800 and maybe even more than that,"" he said. ""I think we will find that the planet is too warm, ice is melting too fast... and we'll want to bring the CO2 back down again. The only way we can do that on a short timescale would be to pull it back out of the atmosphere."" Broecker told CNN the units could stand in the middle of Australia, for example, and their presence wouldn't significantly disrupt the atmospheric distribution. ""Each unit would take out a ton of CO2 a day -- which would be the amount of CO2 produced by 20 average automobiles in the U.S.A. And the cost of each unit would be about the cost of a Toyota. So that would mean if you added a five percent surcharge on automobile purchases that money could go to building units to remove the CO2 those vehicles are going to create.""","""Synthetic tree"" would capture carbon dioxide in the air to reduce emissions .

"(The Frisky)  -- ""How I Met Your Mother"" has me a little confused. I've watched the show since the beginning and think it is one of the best sitcoms, evah. It's laugh-out-loud funny and unpredictable (Who can forget Slapsgiving or Robin's Canadian pop single, ""Let's Go To The Mall""?), and gets the late 20-something experience like no other show. Not to mention that Neil Patrick Harris as Barney is one of the funniest characters of all time. But, I digress. The premise of the show has been that Ted is narrating to his children how he met their mother. Only, fours years in, we still have no idea who she is. Earlier this year, the show's executive producer PROMISED that in episode 100, airing this coming Monday, we would finally be introduced to this elusive mother. At the same time, it was leaked that Rachel Bilson was cast for a recurring role on the show. It made so much sense: Ted and Rachel, Rachel and Ted. They're both brunette and would look adorable together. But now new casting news is messing everything up. I just read that two other ladies of note are getting roles on the show. First up is former pro-wrestler Stacy Keibler, who will also be in the 100th episode. And Carrie Underwood just confirmed that she will be on the show this spring. So, uh, who is the mother? My instinct tells me that Bilson is too obvious a choice, considering this is a show that's kept us guessing for four years. The Frisky: 13 super annoying ways people abuse Facebook and Twitter . Remember how, after watching Ted and Robin's romance begin to blossom, we got to the last second of the season premiere and Ted said, ""And that's how I met your Aunt Robin.""

"Editor's note: Col. Ann Wright, who served for 29 years in the U.S. Army and Army Reserves, was one of the first State Department officers to open the U.S. Embassy in Kabul in 2001. She resigned from the State Department in protest the day the Iraq War began. She had served as a diplomat for 16 years and received the State Department's Award for Heroism. Paul Kawika Martin is Peace Action's political director and the founder of the Afghanistan Policy Working Group. President Obama just announced he plans to send 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan, where hatred of the U.S. grows every day. Next door, nuclear-armed Pakistan tilts toward disaster. It's time for Americans to insist on a nonmilitary way out of this mess. We recently returned from a CodePink study trip to Afghanistan, and our expertise and experience points to a strategy of transitioning from military to political and economic solutions that will help Afghans while making Americans safer. The first step in providing Afghans security and weakening the Taliban and violent extremists is to remove recruiting incentives. It's time to stop air and Predator drone strikes that tend to kill, injure and terrorize civilians. It's time to stop arbitrary detentions and harsh treatment of prisoners that would be unacceptable here. While those in major cities live in relative security, rural Afghans fear violence from insurgents or U.S. and NATO forces. Many fear civil war or the return of the Taliban. Afghanistan requires more trusted Afghan police and security forces. These forces are paid only $110 dollars a month -- not a living wage -- and payments are regularly late. Little wonder these forces are corrupt, poorly motivated and have a high rate of desertion. The Taliban pays its foot soldiers far better. Investing in a living wage and pressuring Hamid Karzai's government to punish corruption swiftly will pay more security dividends than the $1 million a year it costs to send one U.S. soldier. There is no reason to believe the U.S. military is in the best position to train Afghans, given huge cultural differences and past abuses by U.S. forces. The United Nations is expert in training security forces in ways that are culturally sensitive. The U.S. should ask (and help fund) the U.N. to take over the training of Afghan troops and police, with a focus on training Afghan trainers. With Afghan unemployment above 40 percent, job creation is critical to security. Vocational training, infrastructure construction and assistance to farmers will help. We can pay for this economic development by spending current funds more wisely. A criminally small amount of the international aid and development money spent over the last eight years has trickled down to Afghans. Instead, foreign contractors, subcontractors and importers have profited from Afghan misery. USAID's new mantra of ""Afghans first"" is a start, as long as actions match the rhetoric. One successful program that deserves full funding is the National Solidarity Project, an Afghan-run community development program administered by the well-regarded Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development. Obama, NATO commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon should all mandate that where possible, Afghans -- including their businesses, NGOs and products -- should implement and directly benefit from aid projects. Obama didn't mention Afghan women in his speech. Funding women-led NGOs, women's education and job training and hiring women can help raise their status. Outside the capital, not much has changed for Afghan women. Because of cultural traditions, many rural women stay home for lack of security or because of their husbands' demands. The U.S. could transition resources to the Afghan justice system to properly enforce laws about rape and domestic violence, and ensure that girls younger than 16 are not forced to marry. The president rightly mentioned the importance of the Pakistan border. More resources must be transferred to securing the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. This is easier said than done, as U.S. border guards know from their own difficulties of securing the Mexican border. Nonetheless, the international community can increase political pressure on Pakistan to strengthen their border patrols and rid their country of violent extremists such as al Qaeda. Despite assurances by the president, more troops will not provide more security to Afghans. The mere presence of foreign forces and some of their actions have created more  Taliban recruits and violent extremists. Instead of starting to bring troops home in 18 months, U.S. and NATO forces must tell internal and regional stakeholders -- publicly or privately -- that there will be a range of time, say 12 to 24 months, when their military presence will cease. Then, they must apply significant pressure and concrete support for a public, comprehensive peace process. This process must include all interested parties, including the Karzai administration, tribal leaders, the Taliban, women leaders, as well as neighboring Iran, Pakistan and India. The U.S. mission in Afghanistan can then focus on rebuilding the country the U.S. partly destroyed eight years ago (through air strikes and funding warlords in the Northern Alliance), lifting Afghans out of poverty and making the country less of a haven or recruiting center for extremists. It's time for a transition from military investments to an economic and civic strategy that supports reconciling and reintegrating Taliban fighters, reducing poverty and rebuilding infrastructure. Obama outlined escalation rather than the needed transition. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ann Wright and Paul Kawika Martin.","U.S., NATO need to stop giving Taliban reasons to recruit supporters, authors say .

"(CNN) -- The alleged victim in a 1977 sexual assault case against director Roman Polanski has filed court papers seeking dismissal of the charges against him. Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski has lived in exile in France since fleeing the United States in 1978. The woman's declaration seeking dismissal was filed Monday in Los Angeles, California, in connection with Polanski's efforts to have the 31-year-old case dismissed. Polanski, 75, has lived in exile in France since fleeing the United States in 1978 after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse. Polanski admitted to having sex with a 13-year-old girl, and an arrest warrant against him remains in effect. In her declaration, Samantha Geimer said, ""I am no longer a 13-year-old child. I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim, have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception. ""Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court, great focus is made of me, my family, my mother and others. That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety, the continuation of the case."" Geimer, who has spoken publicly about the case before, including a 2003 appearance on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" added, ""I have survived, indeed prevailed, against whatever harm Mr. Polanski may have caused me as a child."" She chided the district attorney's office for not dismissing the case earlier and for ""yet once again (giving) great publicity to the lurid details of those events, for all to read again. True as they may be, the continued publication of those details cause harm to me ... I have become a victim of the actions of the District Attorney."" The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office had no immediate response to Geimer's declaration. Lawyers for the Oscar-winning film director filed a motion for dismissal of the sex offense case against him in December, citing what the defense called ""extraordinary new evidence"" of ""repeated, unlawful and unethical misconduct"" by the Los Angeles district attorney's office and the judge in Polanski's case. The December motion also argued that Polanski should not be required to return to the United States to appear in court for the dismissal motion to be considered. In her declaration, Geimer said if Polanski cannot appear in court, she will do so to seek dismissal. ""My position is absolutely clear,"" she said. Polanski's motion for dismissal is scheduled for a hearing on January 21. Polanski, a native of Poland, won the Academy Award in 2003 for his Holocaust drama, ""The Pianist."" Among his other films from earlier in his career are ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Chinatown."" His first wife, actress Sharon Tate, was murdered by the Charles Manson family in 1969.","Motion filed to dismiss a 31-year-old sex offense case against Roman Polanski .

"Washington (CNN) -- The chairman of the Republican Party and a leading GOP senator called on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to give up his post Sunday, following the publication of remarks he made about President Obama's race in 2008. A new book quotes Reid, D-Nevada, as saying privately in 2008 that Obama could be successful as a black candidate in part because of his ""light-skinned"" appearance and speaking patterns ""with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one."" The remarks were ""embarrassing and racially insensitive,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, head of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, in a statement to CNN. GOP Chairman Michael Steele, on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" said: ""Racism and racist conversations have no place today in America."" Steele also was on the defensive for a remark he made last week that members of both parties have called a racial slur. In an interview with Fox News, Steele used the phrase ""honest injun."" The Congressional Black Caucus has accepted Reid's apology and is dismissing calls for him to step down as majority leader. Rep. Barbara Lee, chairwoman of the caucus, issued the following statement: ""I have had an opportunity to speak with Senator Reid and he apologized for his unfortunate remarks concerning the president, and he understands the gravity of such remarks. There are too many issues like the economy, job creation and energy for these regrettable comments to distract us from the work that must be done on behalf of the American people."" Democrats also rejected the calls for Reid's dismissal. Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia, chairman of the Democratic Party, said ""the case is closed"" following Reid's round of apologies. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who 20 years ago became the nation's first elected African-American governor, also rejected calls for Reid's ouster. ""I think that what Reid was giving was a personal opinion, which wasn't affecting the laws or the operation of the dispensation of justice in our country,"" Wilder told CNN's ""State of the Union."" But he said he believes the incident ""illustrates the need for more open discussion about race."" Reid's office made clear he has no plans to step down. Democrats rejected the calls for Reid's dismissal, and Reid's office made clear he has no plans to step down. ""Sen. Reid will stay in his position as majority leader and will run for re-election,"" his spokesman said. ""As the leader in the fight to pass the Voting Rights Act and legislation banning hate crimes, Sen. Reid has a long record of addressing issues that are important to the African-American community. His Republican critics who are looking to politicize the issue can't say the same."" Reid's controversial quote is in the book ""Game Change,"" due in stores Monday. The authors write that ""Reid was convinced, in fact, that Obama's race would help him more than hurt him in a bid for the Democratic nomination."" In a statement to CNN, Reid said, ""I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words."" ""I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans, especially African-Americans for my improper comments. I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign and have worked as hard as I can to advance President Obama's legislative agenda,"" Reid said. In his defense, he pointed to his efforts to integrate the Las Vegas strip and the gaming industry, among other legislation favored by African-American voters. ""I have worked hard to advance issues important to the African-American community,"" he said. And the senate leader called Obama on Saturday afternoon to apologize for the remarks. In a statement issued after the call, Obama said, ""As far as I am concerned, the book is closed."" ""Harry Reid called me today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today,"" the president said. ""I accepted Harry's apology without question because I've known him for years, I've seen the passionate leadership he's shown on issues of social justice and I know what's in his heart."" An aide to the senator told CNN that Reid also offered apologies to several prominent African-American political figures, including House Democrats Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and Barbara Lee of California; the Rev. Al Sharpton; CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile; NAACP chairman Julian Bond; and the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Wade Henderson. Steele, the GOP's first African-American chairman, was asked about the remarks on both ""Meet the Press"" and ""Fox News Sunday."" He told NBC on Sunday he believes Reid is out of touch with ""how African-Americans generally feel"" about sensitive issues. Steele was asked by NBC whether he believes the situation is similar to one involving former Sen. Trent Lott, who lost his post as Senate majority leader in 2002 after saying that the nation would have been better off if one-time segregationist candidate Strom Thurmond had been elected president. ""Oh, yeah. There is a big double standard here,"" Steele said on NBC. Steele added: ""When Democrats get caught saying racist things, you know, an apology is enough."" Steele said that if a Republican senator had made the same remark Reid did, Steele himself and the Democratic Party ""would be screaming for his head very much as they were with Trent Lott."" Cornyn, in his statement, also accused Democrats of following a ""double standard,"" and noted that they had pushed Lott to step down. ""As we await his explanation, Sen. Reid should do the right thing, follow the example that he himself set in 2002, and step down as majority leader,"" Cornyn said. Kaine shot back against those arguments. ""Anybody looking at Trent Lott's statements praising somebody who had been a pro-segregation candidate for president will see that there is no comparison between those comments and those of Sen. Reid,"" Kaine told NBC. The comments ""were in the context of praising the senator and acknowledging that the senator could be a great president, but they were still insensitive,"" Kaine said. Asked whether Reid should resign, he said, ""Absolutely not. ... We're moving on."" Nevada state Senate Majority Leader Steven Horsford, who is African-American, affirmed his support for Reid in a statement Saturday. ""While I am disappointed in Sen. Reid's comment and choice of words, I accept his apology,"" said Horsford, a Democrat. ""I have known Sen. Reid for many years and he has consistently been supportive of advancing the interests of the African-American community as he has for all Nevadans and all Americans."" Steele, meanwhile, was asked about his remark in a Fox News interview last week that the GOP platform ""is one of the best political documents that's been written in the last 25 years, 'honest injun' on that."" ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace noted that lawmakers from both parties have called that a racial slur. ""Well, if it is, I apologize for it. It's not an intent to be a racial slur. I wasn't intending to say a racial slur at all,"" Steele said. CNN's Dana Bash, Mark Preston and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report.","NEW: Congressional Black Caucus rejects calls for Reid to step down .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- She walked to the cameras and could barely look up. With her lip quivering, Sherry Jarvis apologized to the family of 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who is clinging to life in a hospital burn unit. Jarvis is the mother of two boys who, along with three other youths, are accused in the burning of Brewer. Detectives say witnesses saw Brewer, consumed in flames, run about a hundred yards, tear off his shirt and jump into a swimming pool. Brewer's screams can be heard on a 911 call from the October 12 incident. Doctors say he was burned on about 65 percent of his body. ""I'd just like to express how horribly sorry we are,"" Jarvis said in a public statement she and her family made Wednesday. Accompanied by her husband and two daughters, Jarvis spoke slowly as she addressed a gathering of reporters. ""This is a horrible incident that should have never had occurred."" said Jarvis, her voice full of sorrow and shock. Her sons, ages 13 and 15, face charges that could send them to prison for a long time. Authorities in Broward County, Florida, believe that Brewer was attacked in a chain of events that began when he did not pay one of the five boys $40 for a video game. That boy stole Brewer's father's bicycle, and when Brewer told police, the youth was arrested, then released, authorities said. The next day, the group of five teens allegedly surrounded Brewer and, according to eyewitnesses, yelled, ""He's a snitch. He's a snitch"" before one of them poured alcohol over him, another sparked a lighter, and Brewer was ablaze. All of the boys had been friends since elementary school, authorities said. They did sleepovers at one another's homes, and their families knew each other. ""We pray for Michael's recovery every day, that he gets stronger, which we know in our hearts that he will,"" Sherry Jarvis said. But doctors are unsure about his recovery. Brewer remains on a ventilator. A machine is breathing for him. Each day, a team of doctors spends about four hours changing his bandages. He remains heavily sedated and is going through a very difficult period right now, according to doctors. ""The swelling has come way down, and you can recognize facial expressions now,"" said Dr. Nicholas Namias, medical director of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Miami. ""We're still dealing with the respiratory failure. We're dealing with infection now and the need to supply the massive amount of nutrition that this person needs to survive,"" Namias told CNN. ""People are writing horror stories ... but people just can't imagine the kind of sickness we're talking about. He is by no means well ... but the expectation is survival,"" he said. Because he is sedated and on the ventilator, Brewer has been unable to communicate with detectives. Earlier this week, prosecutors were granted extra time to build their cases against the five teens, four 15-year-olds and the 13-year-old. Prosecutors have until November 12 to charge the five as adults, or they will be charged as juveniles and released pending trial later. The 13-year-old cannot face adult charges under Florida law, but that would change if Brewer died. Prosecutors want to interview Brewer about the incident, but doctors say that is unlikely to happen before next week. Brewer's family was not represented at the Jarvis family's public apology. The victim's parents could not be reached for comment. After making her apology, Jarvis said the family would not take questions from the gathered reporters. ""I don't have the words to express any more. I can't answer any more questions because of the criminal case that's still pending,"" she said. The Jarvis family has received death threats, according to family members and their attorney. They haven't stayed at their home since the incident, they say, adding that people have been throwing garbage and even dead animals on their property. On Wednesday, with their attorney at their side, they simply wanted to say to Michael Brewer and his family that they are sorry. Detectives have returned to the Brewer house, after two dolls were found in the swimming pool. The male and female dolls had been melted together, head to feet. ""At this point, we're thinking it's a sick joke, said Jim Leljedal, a spokesman for the Broward County Sheriff's Office. ""It's being classified as criminal mischief, but we'd like to know who's responsible,"" he said.","Five teenagers are accused in the burning of a Florida boy .

"(CNN) -- An oil tanker bound for the United States was hijacked off Somalia with a crew of 28 aboard, maritime authorities said. The M/V Maran Centaurus was commandeered about 600 nautical miles northeast of the Seychelles, on its way to New Orleans, Louisiana, according to the Maritime Security Center. The crew consists of 16 Filipinos, nine Greeks, two Ukrainians and a Romanian, said the security agency, which is run by the European naval force. The 300,000-ton tanker, which started out from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was seized Sunday. It had changed course westward, toward Harardhere or Hobyo, along Somali's central-western coast. Somali pirates have turned high-seas kidnappings into a lucrative business. Pirates have captured more than 50 ships this year off Somalia and are currently holding 12, including the fishing vessel Alakrana, Spanish Defense Minister Carme Chacon said recently. Attacks in the region have significantly increased this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes. But successful attacks have gone down as a result of a strong presence of international monitors. The first nine months of this year have seen more pirate attacks than all of last year, the bureau reported on October 21. From January 1 through September 30, pirates worldwide mounted 306 attacks, compared with 293 in all of 2008, it said. More than half of this year's attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia.","M/V Maran Centaurus commandeered about 600 nautical miles northeast of the Seychelles .

"London, England (CNN) -- A controversial Muslim group planning to stage an anti-war march through a town that receives British war dead will be banned in the UK from Thursday. British Home Secretary Alan Johnson prepared an order Tuesday proscribing Al-Muhajiroun, also known as Islam4UK. ""Proscription is a tough but necessary power to tackle terrorism and is not a course we take lightly,"" Johnson said in a statement. Al-Muhajiroun is already banned under two other names in the Terrorism Act 2000 -- Al-Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect. Johnson said the ban would now also apply to ""a number"" of the other names the group goes by. The proscription does not need approval by Parliament, because it is considered an amendment to the act, said the Home Office spokeswoman, who did not give her name in line with policy. ""We are clear that an organization should not be able to circumvent proscription by simply changing its name,"" Johnson said. The ban would prevent Al-Muhajiroun from having meetings or raising money, and it would make attending a meeting or being a member of the group a crime. The group's leader, controversial British Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary, had threatened to stage a march in the town of Wootton Bassett as a protest against the war in Afghanistan. Choudary said Sunday, after news of Johnson's plans, that the Home Office could not shut him down. ""We're not going to stop because the government bans an organization,"" he told CNN by phone. ""If that means setting up another platform under another label, then so be it."" A ban ""will just make the use of those names ... illegal. But Muslims everywhere are obliged to work collectively to establish the Islamic state and sharia law in the UK or wherever they are -- those things can't change,"" he added. The bodies of British war dead are traditionally brought to Wootton Bassett, near a Royal Air Force base, when they are returned to the country. Relatives and friends line the streets of the town along with local residents as hearses carry the flag-draped British remains, in scenes of public mourning widely reported by British media. Choudary's proposal to march empty coffins through the streets drew fury and outrage. The Home Office had said the march would be illegal if the group were banned, but the decision to proscribe the group was not caused only by its plans for the march, the Home Office said. Choudary has never announced a date for his march and area police said he had not contacted them about it, as march organizers are required to do beforehand. The Terrorism Act 2000 gives the home secretary the power to ban groups if the punishment is ""proportionate and based on evidence that a group is concerned in terrorism as defined in the Terrorism Act 2000,"" according to the Home Office. According to the law, groups can be banned if they commit or participate in terrorism; prepare for terrorism; or promote or encourage terrorism. The home secretary can also take into account factors such as specific threats posed to the United Kingdom or British nationals overseas, and the extent of the group's presence in the United Kingdom.","Ban on Al-Muhajiroun, also known as Islam4UK, will take effect Thursday .

"London, England (CNN) -- A British doctors group called Wednesday for a ban on all smoking in cars, saying the secondhand smoke inside a vehicle can cause severe health problems for children and adults. The Royal College of Physicians made the recommendation in a new report on how secondhand smoke, also called passive smoking, affects children. The report found that, for children, secondhand smoke annually causes more than 20,000 cases of lower respiratory tract infection, 120,000 cases of middle ear disease, at least 22,000 cases of wheezing and asthma, 200 cases of bacterial meningitis, and 40 sudden infant deaths. These cases generate more than 300,000 doctor visits each year and about 9,500 hospital admissions, costing the National Health Service about £23.3 million ($34.9 million) each year, the report said. The findings were based on studies funded by Cancer Research UK and carried out by the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies. England's chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, said the report will contribute to the the government's review of existing smoking legislation in England later this year. Smoking was made illegal in all public spaces in the United Kingdom in 2007. ""This is a serious public health concern,"" Donaldson said. Health effects on children from secondhand smoke are ""entirely avoidable,"" the report says. It laid out a series of policy recommendations to reduce those effects, including the ban on smoking in cars. ""Smoke-free legislation should be extended much more widely to include public places frequented by children and young people, and to prohibit all smoking in cars and other vehicles,"" the report urged. The report also urged a hike in tobacco prices, more effective health warnings, more generic packaging for tobacco products, and tailored stop-smoking services. ""This report isn't just about protecting children from passive smoking, it's about taking smoking completely out of children's lives,"" said John Britton, chairman of the Royal College of Physicians' Tobacco Advisory Group. Smokers' lobby group Forest said the proposals ""go way beyond what is acceptable in a free society"" and are a first step to banning smoking in homes. ""We wouldn't encourage people to smoke around children, but adults should be allowed to use their common sense and act accordingly,"" said Simon Clark, director of Forest. ""We don't need laws to regulate every aspect of our behavior."" Clark said the report's claims are a ""huge exaggeration."" ""Unfortunately the anti-smoking industry isn't interested in compromise. It just wants to bully smokers until they quit,"" Clark said.","British doctors group calls for ban on all smoking in cars .

"(CNN) -- Shah Rukh Khan, the Bollywood superstar, has become more than a little accustomed to being adored by millions. ""I don't want to be anonymous... I'm very honest about that. I love being recognized, I love people liking me, I love the fact that people scream when I go out. I think I'll miss all that when it's taken away,"" he told CNN. But earlier this year comments by Khan, the owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders, caused a storm of controversy and attention he didn't want. Khan questioned the lack of Pakistani players in this year's competition, and Indian Hindu nationalist party Shiv Sena interpreted the comments as inflammatory. Threats were made to boycott his latest film and some activists made some threats against him and his family's safety. ""It just went onto a political agenda platform, onto an activist platform. I'm not on the same playing field. I'm an actor, I'm not a politician,"" he said. ""This was my point of view... it wasn't as if I was saying something new. I didn't know it would cause so much trouble, and especially when a film was releasing, you don't want that kind of trouble. It just went completely through the roof."" Khan is keen to keep his roles as an actor, cricket team boss and icon for millions as far from the political realm as possible. His face is one of the most salable in India with his image used in a raft of adverts and supporting products. Yet his recent film ""My Name is Khan"" did touch upon religious sensitivities, striking a chord among cinema goers in Muslim countries across the world. In the film Khan, himself a Muslim, plays an autistic Muslim immigrant in American soon after the terrorists attack on September 11, 2001. ""I really thought the film was about humanity. It's not about Islam, it could have been about any religion to be honest,"" he said. ""But I simply thought we made a film about humanity. I knew it would do well but I didn't know it would this well because it is a very niche sort of a subject.""","Bollywood superstar is also owner of Kolkata Knight Riders cricket team .

"New York (CNN) -- Every year, beginning with the January birthday celebrations for the Rev. Martin Luther King and moving through Black History Month in February, Americans and others revisit the history, role and significance of the black freedom movement in the United States. But there is a frequent tendency to misrepresent the lessons of that movement and apply them to other social movements overseas in a way that misses the mark. This has been happening increasingly with the historical lessons that are being misapplied to the Palestinian freedom movement. It has become almost a cliché, yet people, including Irish rocker Bono, continue to wield King's name when they bemoan the alleged absence of his like among the Palestinians. It seems no matter what Palestinian activists do, they are condemned as terrorists. Whether they are engaged in armed struggle or nonviolent direct action, it does not matter: Palestinian activists are often portrayed as extremists who threaten life and property. The obvious exceptions are those Palestinians who are prepared to accept whatever terms the United States insists upon for the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The recent arrests of Palestinian human rights activists Jamal Juma', Abdallah Abu Rahma, Ibrahim Amirah and Mohammed Othman are prime examples. Juma' and Othman were imprisoned without charge, Amirah faces charges of incitement, organizing illegal demonstrations, and stone-throwing, and Abu Rahma is confronted with a charge of ""illegal weapons possession,"" apparently because a protest sign he created included a spent tear gas canister . In fact, they were imprisoned (Juma' was released on January  12 and Othman on January 13 after he was held nearly four months) not for firing missiles or ambushing Israeli troops, but for protesting what the International Court of Justice has called the illegal Israeli separation wall that carves up the West Bank and places Palestinian communities in an existence that recalls South African apartheid. The systematic detention of such leaders has been condemned by Amnesty International, but the U.S. public is unlikely to get even a hint that the Israeli government is furthering its efforts to smash dissent in the occupied territories. These recent crackdowns make even more ironic the hope expressed by Bono last month in The New York Times ""that people in places filled with rage and despair, places like the Palestinian territories, will in the days ahead find among them their Gandhi, their King, their Aung San Suu Kyi."" As a commenter on his column noted, these people exist today and have existed within the Palestinian movement. They are just in jail ... or dead. Bassem Abu Rahme, for example, was killed by a teargas canister fired at close range by an Israeli soldier on April 17 while taking part in one of the weekly nonviolent protests that are regularly met with tear gas, billy clubs, rubber bullets and the threat of arrest. I believe that Bassem, like many others, was following in Gandhi's path. While it is certainly true that some of the protests by Palestinians are violent, the same could be said of the anti-colonial protests that took place on the Indian subcontinent against the British at the time of Gandhi. Gandhi certainly preached nonviolent direct action, yet there were others within the independence movement that advocated forceful courses of action. Nevertheless, smearing or repressing all protests in the name of moving against those who use violence is disingenuous, a point well understood when viewing other freedom struggles, whether the Indian independence movement or the black freedom struggle in the United States. In fact, this repression becomes a means not of suppressing violence, but of suppressing all resistance to injustice. This is experienced today by the Palestinian movement. Its objectives are caricatured and maligned by Israel in order to make the repression easier. In this period -- from King's birthday through the celebrations and discussions that take place during Black History Month -- it is useful to recall similar treatment King and other freedom fighters endured, and reflect on the true lessons from his life and struggles that are relevant to the Palestinian struggle and its hopes for a lasting peace. Despite King's acceptance now in mainstream circles, he was first and foremost a troublemaker in the cause of justice. While King believed in peace, he was more importantly a person of action, and one completely intolerant of injustice. In that sense he was a thorn in the side of the powers that be and the status quo. King did not achieve credibility by simply preaching peace and good will, and certainly not by being passive or submissive in the face of oppression. He gained credibility because he was a person who was prepared to challenge the unjust laws and practices of his period, laws and practices that were summarized in the notion of Jim Crow segregation. Even though Jim Crow was the law in much of the United States, King and countless others were prepared to break the law and, thereby, threaten the stability of this country. He was branded a communist, a malcontent and a criminal, all with the aim of discrediting him. And, when that was not enough, and his following did not disappear into the night, he was harassed and faced repeated death threats, ultimately leading to his murder. The condemnation of Palestinian activists as terrorists, no matter their approach, shares a great deal in common with the manner in which King and African-American freedom fighters (and their allies) were demonized and repressed. It was the basic cause that needed to be destroyed by the oppressor and not just the individuals. The same is true today as Palestinian activists, including those who have consciously and openly repudiated armed struggle, are sidelined so that the Israeli government can claim, with a straight face, that it has no Palestinian partner with which it can discuss peace. The ""partners"" are there in Palestine. When we celebrate the courage and vision of freedom fighters such as King or Fannie Lou Hamer and the countless others who are remembered during Black History Month, we should think of those Palestinian Kings and Fannie Lou Hamers whose nonviolent struggle for freedom, justice and equality continues. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bill Fletcher Jr.","Bill Fletcher says it is common to mistakenly bemoan lack of peaceful Palestinians .

"(CNN) -- A Mississippi lesbian Tuesday won a judge's backing for her contention that her First Amendment rights were violated when her high school refused to allow her to attend her prom with her girlfriend. But U.S. District Judge Glen H. Davidson refused to order the Itawamba County School District in Fulton, Mississippi, to hold the dance it had canceled over the matter. In his 12-page order, Davidson also ruled that Itawamba Agricultural High School's denial of 18-year-old Constance McMillen's request to wear a tuxedo to her prom was a violation of her rights. ""The record shows Constance has been openly gay since eighth grade and she intended to communicate a message by wearing a tuxedo and to express her identity through attending prom with a same-sex date,"" Davidson wrote. ""The court finds this expression and communication of her viewpoint is the type of speech that falls squarely within the purview of the First Amendment."" When school officials told McMillen she could neither take her girlfriend to the prom nor wear a tuxedo to the event, the senior went to the American Civil Liberties Union, which demanded the school change its policy. In response, the school district canceled the prom altogether. Davidson denied a motion for an injunction filed by McMillen against the school district's superintendent, the school's principal and its assistant principal asking the court to order that the April 2 prom be reinstated, saying that parents were planning a private event to be held on that date for all students, including McMillen. Requiring school officials ""to step back into a sponsorship role at this late date would only confuse and confound the community on the issue,"" he said. Read the judge's opinion (PDF) Both sides in the dispute were happy with the outcome. ""It vindicates Constance's rights,"" said Christine Sun, senior counsel with the ACLU's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender project. ""It sets a legal precedent for gay and lesbian students all over the country that they have the right to bring a same-sex date to the prom and also to wear gender-nonconforming clothes to the prom. We were looking for a ruling that what the school did was violate her rights,"" Sun said. School board attorney Michele Floyd said the school district was also pleased with the decision. She said the parent-sponsored event, which may be called a ball instead of a prom, is to be held in Tupelo, 19 miles away. But ACLU's Sun said McMillen had not received an invitation. ""We haven't heard anything about this private prom other than what this school district has told us,"" she said. ""It remains to be seen whether she will be able to attend the private prom."" McMillen's case is going forward on a damages claim and the ACLU's request for attorneys' fees, she said. ""She got what she wanted, and now it's just a question of what the damages might be in her case."" ""I never thought the school would try to cancel the prom and hurt everyone just to keep me and my girlfriend from going together,"" McMillen said last week in an ACLU news release. ""A lot of people have made really generous offers to pay for a prom somewhere else, which I really appreciate. But all I've ever wanted was to be able to just go to my own school's prom with my girlfriend."" At the center of the lawsuit is a February 5 memorandum from the school to students that said prom dates must be of the opposite sex. Superintendent Teresa McNeece also told McMillen that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if other students complained about their presence, according to the documents.","ACLU, school board attorney both say they're pleased with the decision .

"Washington (CNN) -- A representative at the Virginia mosque of five Americans arrested in Pakistan said it plans to conduct an inquiry into the circumstances that led to the arrests. The men were arrested by Pakistani police this week amid suspicion that they were plotting terrorist attacks and planned to go to Afghanistan, a development that shocked members of the ICNA Center, the mosque the five attended. At a news conference Friday, friends of the five and members of the mosque expressed their surprise over the arrests, defending the activities at the mosque as positive and describing the five as ""wholesome, regular kids."" Attorney Ashraf Nubani said he believes the incident is isolated, but said the mosque is conducting an inquiry into the matter. While members of the mosque didn't comment on the reports and charges emerging from Pakistan, they described a tight-knit, patriotic congregation that focused on community service. They were grateful for the actions of law enforcement and expressed profound empathy for the families of the people held. A Pakistani police interrogation report, dated Thursday, shined more light on the Wednesday arrests of the five Americans at a home in Sargodha, a town about 120 miles south of Islamabad. The men will be transferred to Lahore, Pakistan, for security reasons, Interior Minister Rehman Malik said Friday. A sixth man -- the father of one of the five -- was arrested afterward, police said. Read the interrogation report (PDF) The report carries profile detail about the men and shows pictures of Internet sites, laptops, mobile phones, an iPod, and an external hard drive seized by police. ""They had deep interest in the religion and they were of the opinion that a jihad must be waged against the infidels for the atrocities committed by them against Muslims around the world,"" said the report, which refers to the five as college students. The report focused on one of the suspects -- identified as Ahmed Abdullah Minni, a 20-year-old American born in Virginia. It said he regularly goes online to watch attacks on the U.S. military in Afghanistan and that he left comments praising the actions. That caught the attention of militants, and he was eventually contacted by a person named Saifullah, the report said. After contact had been made, a Yahoo! e-mail account was set up so the men and militants could communicate, the report said. E-mails were never sent from the account, but people would leave messages in the draft sections of the e-mail account and delete them after reading them, the Pakistani police report said. ""This mode of communication enabled them to pass on messages without fear of interception by the FBI,"" it said. The report said the suspects made a plan with Saifullah to go from Pakistan to Afghanistan. They gathered in Karachi and left for Hyderabad on December 1. They tried to hook up with two militant groups -- Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Jamaat-ud-Dawa -- but neither group showed interest. ""They went to the madrassa [a Muslim school] of Jaish-e-Mohammad where they informed them about their desire for jihad. However, the management of the madrassa refused to keep them, and advised them to go to Jamat-ud-Dawa Lahore. Interestingly, the Jamat also refused to keep them as they could not provide a surety. Thus, they came along with their friend Umar Farooq to Sargodha,"" the report said. The FBI said Pakistan authorities detained the men -- four of whom it said were found to have American passports -- on Wednesday, ""after they came to the attention of police."" An FBI statement did not give further details and did not identify the men. Officials said the six men include three Pakistani-Americans, an Ethiopian-American, an Egyptian-American and an Eritrean-American. Along with Minni, there were snapshots and brief profiles of only four others -- Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan, and Ramy Zamzam -- all from the Washington area. The sixth man was Khalid Farouk, father of Umar, the report said. Mustafa Abu Maryam, a volunteer youth coordinator, said he never saw ""extreme behavior"" from the suspects, noting that youth group discussions never broached on politics or conflict. ""Our main focus is to be a positive force of good in our young men's lives. To be a deterrent of wrong groups and gangs and all other negative influences out there, to be a positive model for these kids,"" Abu Maryam said. Mahdi Bray, executive director of the Muslim American Society Freedom Foundation, said the incident is a ""wake-up call"" to the many negative influences youth face and touched on what he said were harmful messages sweeping across cyberspace. ""We are determined not to let religious extremists exploit the vulnerability of the emotions of our children through slick, seductive and destructive propaganda on the Internet. We are sending a message loud and clear that those days are over where we will not respond in kind on the Internet to vile propaganda that misrepresents the Islamic faith,"" Bray said. Subira Farouk, the wife of Khalid and mother of Umar, said on Thursday that she and her husband had traveled to Pakistan to arrange a marriage for Umar, and to her surprise, her son had arrived in the country shortly afterward.","Members of the mosque describe five students as ""wholesome, regular kids.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama will sign sweeping health care reform legislation into law at the White House on Tuesday, according to two Democratic officials familiar with the planning. Obama also will hit the road to sell the measure to a still-skeptical public, giving a speech Thursday in Iowa City, Iowa, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Obama launched his grass-roots drive for health care reform in Iowa City in May 2007, according to Gibbs. The bill, which constitutes the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees in more than four decades, passed the House of Representatives late Sunday night with no Republican support. It was approved by the Senate in December. A separate compromise package of changes also passed the House on Sunday and still needs to be approved by the Senate. The officials noted that the Senate cannot begin debate on the package before Obama signs the underlying bill into law. Passage of the bill was a huge boost for Obama, who made health care reform a domestic priority. Aides said Monday that Obama exchanged handshakes, hugs and ""high-fives"" with staffers when the outcome of the House vote became apparent. ""I haven't seen the president so happy about anything other than his family since I've known him,"" said senior adviser David Axelrod, adding that Obama's jubilation Sunday night exceeded his election victory in November 2008. ""He was excited that night, but not like last night."" Republicans promised to continue fighting the reforms, with 11 state attorneys general -- all Republican -- planning lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the bill's mandate for people to buy health insurance and requirements for states to comply with its provisions. Senior Republicans in Congress warned that voters will judge Democrats harshly in November's midterm elections, with Sen. John McCain of Arizona saying the Democratic-passed bill killed any chance of bipartisan support on legislation for the rest of the year. ""There will be no cooperation for the rest of this year,"" McCain said in an interview with KFYI radio in Arizona. ""They have poisoned the well in what they have done and how they have done it."" Highlights of what's in the bill . White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, however, said the administration expects to win any lawsuits filed against the bill, and he challenged McCain and other Republicans to campaign for the November election against benefits of the health care bill such as tax credits for small businesses and an end to insurance company practices such as denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. The overall $940 billion plan is projected to extend insurance coverage to roughly 32 million additional Americans. Most Americans will now be required to have health insurance or pay a fine. Larger employers will be required to provide coverage or risk financial penalties. Lifetime coverage limits will be banned, and insurers will be barred from denying coverage based on gender or pre-existing conditions. The compromise package would add to the bill's total cost partly by expanding insurance subsidies for middle- and lower-income families. The measure would scale back the bill's taxes on expensive insurance plans. House Democrats are expected to celebrate passage of the bill at a news conference with reform advocates Tuesday afternoon. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who spearheaded her husband's failed health reform effort in the 1990s, said earlier in the day that Obama's success was an example of the president's tenacity. ""If you ever doubt the resolve of President Obama to stay with a job, look at what we got done for the United States last night when it came to passing quality affordable health care for everyone,"" Clinton said during a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Was it all worth it for Obama? Observers warn, however, that the road ahead for health care reform in the Senate may be rocky. Democratic leaders are using a legislative maneuver called reconciliation, which will allow the compromise plan to clear the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes. But according to Senate rules, members are still allowed to offer unlimited amendments and challenges. In one of the first of many attempts Republicans say they will make to try to amend or kill the package, GOP aides went to Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin on Monday to argue that the compromise bill violates rules of the reconciliation process because of the way it affects Social Security. For that reason, GOP aides said they argued, the bill should not even be allowed to be debated. However, Frumin, according to a senior Republican and a Democratic aide, informed both parties he disagreed with the GOP assessment, and would not block the bill from reaching the Senate floor. ""There's hope that [the vote] would be done within a short period of time, like a week or so,"" said Tim McBride, a health economist and associate dean of public health at the Brown School at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. ""But the Senate is complicated and doesn't have the discipline that the House does."" Once the package hits the Senate floor, the chamber's rules stipulate that there must be 20 hours of debate. But that 20 hours may prove to be more of a suggestion than an indicator of what will happen, according to Cheryl Block, a law professor at Washington University's School of Law. ""It could get all messy and could go on forever if [Republicans] threw up amendment after amendment,"" Block said. ""Theoretically, it should only take 20 hours, but it will likely take longer because Republicans have things up their sleeve."" If any provision in the package of changes is rejected or changed, the entire package would then have to go back to the House for another vote. iReport: Share your views on health care reform . House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill have been continually reassured that the compromise package will be approved by the more conservative Senate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, presented a letter to House Democrats on Saturday stating that their Senate counterparts ""believe that health insurance reform cannot wait and must not be obstructed."" So far, two of the 59 senators in the Democratic caucus, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, have said they will oppose the compromise package. CNN's Ed Henry, Ed Hornick, Josh Levs, Alan Silverleib and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Obama to travel to Iowa to continue sales pitch to still-skeptical public .

"London, England (CNN)  -- Protesters called on the worldwide community to take action against Uganda Thursday as the African nation considers stricter laws against homosexuality. They compared Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to some of the world's most notorious dictators. ""In the last five years we have seen Idi Amin return to Uganda and his name is Yoweri Museveni,"" Ugandan human rights campaigner Michael Senyonjo told CNN. ""He... is bringing in a bill in an attempt to criminalize being gay,"" the activist said. ""That is not right. We cannot allow fascism to return to Uganda. He should leave power and go because he is not taking the country anywhere but to disaster,"" he added. Under proposed new laws currently being considered by the Ugandan parliament, those who test positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, could face the death penalty. In addition, those convicted of having gay sex would be sentenced to life in prison, while anyone found guilty of engaging in homosexual relations on more than one occasion would be executed. The proposals could become law before the end of the year. Museveni has not publicly stated his support for the bill. Homosexuality is already illegal in Uganda under laws passed in the colonial era, but the new legislation is intended to provide prosecutors with more power. It has the blessing of various religious leaders, with one leading Muslim cleric -- Sheikh Ramathan Shaban Mubajje -- calling for all known homosexuals in the country to be rounded up and left on an island until they die. Thursday's protest at the Ugandan High Commission -- or embassy -- in London is one of several planned demonstrations around the world, and OutRage, another gay rights organization, is backing the calls for action to be taken. ""President Museveni is fast becoming the Robert Mugabe of Uganda and that's a threat to the civil rights of every Ugandan person -- gay or straight,"" OutRage spokesman Peter Tatchell told CNN, referring to the authoritarian president of Zimbabwe. ""There's a huge ground swell of public opinion that this bill goes way too far. Even people who say they're against homosexuality say this bill is excessive and a threat to the human rights of all Ugandans. ""Uganda should drop this law and abide by international human rights legislation,"" Tatchell said.","Homosexuality illegal in Uganda but lawmakers considering tougher laws .

"Washington (CNN) -- The retired general who took charge of relief efforts in New Orleans, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina said Thursday that the U.S. military should have arrived in earthquake-devastated Haiti 24 hours earlier. ""The good Samaritans who moved early on the first day are to be applauded. They made a difference,"" said Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, a CNN contributor. ""What we've got to do now is get the heavy equipment in. I thought the U.S. military could have been there a day earlier. They're on the ground now, and they have a brigade en route, and that's going to make a big difference,"" he said. Honore, best known for his management of the recovery efforts after the hurricane that killed about 2,000 people on the Gulf Coast, said ""time is of the essence"" in helping quake survivors. Repairing the seaport at Port-au-Prince and keeping the airport open are key to bringing in equipment, food, water and medicine, Honore said. Regarding the airport, he said, ""You need to put the right commander there who's going to be a battle captain and keep those aircraft flowing. You come in, you drop off what you have, you put the sick and wounded on and then move out. No one is standing any time on the airfield. You can be in and out in a half hour."" Speaking at the House Democratic Caucus Retreat later Thursday, Obama acknowledged the scrutiny focused on U.S. response. ""This is a time when the world looks to us and they say -- given our capacity, given our unique capacity to project power around the world -- that we have to project that not just for our own interests but for the interests of the world as a whole,"" he said. ""And my national security team understands that I will not put up with any excuses for us not doing the very best in this time of tragedy."" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley defended the pace of the rescue. ""We are 40 hours into the crisis. In that time, we have reopened the airport and brought it up to 24/7 operations. We continue to look at the port facility, which will be critical to be able to bring in substantial amounts of aid, and we're trying to figure out a strategy for how to function,"" he said. ""We now have multiple search and rescue units on the ground. They're already at work,"" Crowley added. ""Logistics matter. You have an airport with a single runway. So we have things that are queued up. You're going to see a significant increase in the flow, but there is a capacity issue,"" he said. Airlines such as American, Delta, Jet Blue and United were helping provide assistance to the country in the form of free miles for its program members and seats for aid organizations. American was operating humanitarian flights, with three American Eagle aircraft flying 30,000 pounds of supplies into Haiti on Thursday. Three more such flights were planned Friday. American is also partnering with the American Red Cross by offering one-time awards of 250 or 500 bonus miles for donations. In the afternoon, the Federal Aviation Administration announced that Haiti had suspended flights into the Port-au-Prince airport because ramp space -- where aircraft are parked, unloaded, loaded, refueled or boarded -- was overcrowded. There also was no fuel, FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said. Several U.S. military units planned to depart from the United States for Haiti during the day, but it was unclear whether all would be able to do so. Among those apparently delayed was a battalion of more than 100 soldiers from the XVIII Airborne Corps based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. They had planned to fly out Thursday afternoon. Paratroopers from the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division, also based at Fort Bragg, were on their way to Haiti, said Rajiv Shah, coordinator for U.S. assistance to the stricken area. He also is administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The 82nd was deployed to New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina. The first of about 3,500 paratroopers were to board C-17 aircraft from Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina and arrive in Haiti before nightfall. On Friday, another 800 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne were to deploy. In all, the U.S. military has 329 people in Haiti, including a group that arrived Tuesday night to help open the airfield in Port-au-Prince, the commander of U.S. Southern Command said Thursday. The Southern Command, based in Miami, Florida, is leading the Department of Defense's quake response. ""We're working feverishly and aggressively to support and provide life-sustaining capability to the citizens of Haiti,"" Air Force Gen. Douglas Fraser said. ""They've suffered a great deal."" Offshore, four U.S. Coast Guard cutters and a destroyer were providing support, including helicopter support, he said. A disaster relief assessment team was surveying the area, and a battalion of paratroopers along with a command-and-control element from the 82nd Airborne arrived Thursday, he said. The aircraft carrier Carl Vinson is to arrive in Haiti on Friday morning, carrying 19 helicopters and 30 pallets of relief goods, he said. The carrier will help relief workers get around Haiti's decimated infrastructure ""to get good where they need to be,"" Fraser said. Within four days, 700 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne will be in Haiti, he said. Those numbers will swell considerably. On Tuesday, three more ships will arrive, carrying 2,200 Marines and heavy equipment, he said. By Saturday, 5,000 to 6,000 men and women dedicated to supporting the relief effort will be in Haiti, he said. And a week from Friday, the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship, is slated to arrive, he said. ""We are aggressively pursuing every action we can to provide relief to Haiti."" The ship is staffed by a crew of 64 and 560 hospital personnel. Rear Adm. Steve Branham, commander of the 7th Coast Guard District headquartered in Miami, said four Coast Guard cutters were in the area, each of them at least 210 feet in length and capable of carrying helicopters. Two more cutters capable of providing heavy-lift capability were en route, he said. Coast Guard aircraft were used Wednesday to move nine critically injured people from the U.S. Embassy in the capital to hospitals in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, he said. State Department Counselor Cheryl Mills said U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Ken Merten met Thursday with Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive to coordinate aid efforts. Responding to questions as to whether the United States was in charge in Haiti because of the lack of Haitian government capacity, Mills said, ""We have no intention of supplanting the leadership of Haiti. We actually see our role as ensuring that the leadership of Haiti is able to provide the leadership that the Haitian people properly expect them to provide."" The United States is providing support to the approximately 45,000 Americans in Haiti, only 300 of whom have expressed an interest in leaving the country, Mills said. Obama has promised $100 million in immediate American relief aid to Haiti, an amount the president said will grow. ""This is one of those moments that calls out for American leadership,"" he said at the White House. ""One of the largest relief efforts in our recent history"" is now en route to Haiti. The 7.0-magnitude earthquake that struck Tuesday afternoon was centered about 10 miles (15 km) southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, which bore the brunt of the destruction. The port was demolished by the earthquake, which left huge chunks of concrete that blocked the road to truck and other traffic, CNN's Chris Lawrence reported. Those trying to transfer supplies from ships to people who need them will face major hurdles, he said. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States is providing security help to the the United Nations, which was ""equally devastated by the collapse of its headquarters"" for its peacekeeping force in Haiti. As many as 150 of its personnel are missing. She said a contingent of 2,000 Marines will assist international peacekeepers helping to police Haiti, which has no army. Because the U.S. Embassy is one of the few structures that remains intact, it has become a point of support, providing medical assistance for Americans and Haitians who are able to reach it, Mills said. The United States has been trying to contact U.S. citizens in Haiti to see what they need, Mills said. Embassy families and nonessential personnel have been ordered to leave.

""We don't dwell on what happened to us in the crash,"" she says. ""It's more so on the experiences and lessons that we've taken from it."" 'Is this really happening?' A buyer for Belk department stores, Laura was in New York for the fashion market. With the nation in the thick of recession, she scooped up bargains for herself. She carried her trendy purchases through the airport that day on her return home to Charlotte, North Carolina. Wearing a sweater dress, tights and boots, the woman with stylish sandy brown curls was getting a bite to eat when a group of guys asked if she was a model. ""No,"" she said. ""But I am in the fashion industry."" She was traveling with five Belk co-workers. Waiting to board, she fired off e-mails and thought little of the flight home or those around her. Ben -- who was in New York for a quick business trip for Lending Tree -- caught a glimpse of the 5-foot, 10-inch knockout near the gate. Later, when they boarded, he noticed her again, coming down the aisle. ""The first thought I had was it'll be cool if she sits beside me."" He was in 20A, a window seat on the left side of the plane. She sat down three rows in front of him, in 17D, on the aisle. It was one of those fleeting moments every single person knows: You see an intriguing stranger, hope for the best, then move on. Ben picked up a book and began reading. Laura, who didn't notice Ben, thumbed through a Glamour magazine. At the helm of the Airbus A320 was Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, a 57-year-old former Air Force fighter jet pilot. He'd been flying for four decades, for US Airways since 1980. His expertise was about to mean everything. About 90 seconds into the flight, the plane -- traveling at 250 mph and carrying 150 passengers and five crew -- struck a flock of geese. Some passengers described hearing a series of loud thumps. ""One lady screamed,"" Ben recalls. He looked out the window. ""The whole back of the engine was pretty much engulfed in flames, just shooting out of the back,"" he says. He thought: ""This isn't good."" The plane banked to the left. The smell of burning geese, feathers and flames wafted through the cabin. With neither engine working, a silence fell over the jet as it glided through the skies. People began whispering. Some thought they were going back to LaGuardia. Sullenberger came over the speaker system. ""Brace for impact,"" he said. ""The most harrowing thing I'd ever heard in my life,"" Ben recalls. ""I thought for a second: Is this really it? Am I going to die?"" Three rows in front of him, Laura thought about calling her family. She decided against it. If I die, what a depressing message that would be to leave on a message machine, she thought. And what would she say if they did answer? ""Guess what? In 60 seconds, you're not going to be talking to me any more."" She crouched down, prepared for impact. ""Is this really happening?"" Fear of birds and drowning . Laura grew up on a farm in Minnesota and had lived in Fargo, North Dakota, for the past 12 years. She'd jumped at the chance to take on a bigger role with Belk in Charlotte. But her focus on career meant there wasn't much time for relationships while jet-setting around for work. Ben was a Carolina native, and he also poured his energy into work. The software developer at Lending Tree was divorced with no children. Nearing 40, he found his career rewarding, yet felt something was missing. Both had fears that stemmed from their youths. Her bird phobia was rooted in days on the farm, where her grandmother kept chickens. Once, a bird pooped on Laura's shoulder, sending her into tears. As she got older, her disdain for birds grew. When she traveled to New York on business, the abundance of pigeons sometimes terrified her. Ben's fear -- of drowning -- went back to an experience he had when he was 8. On a beach outing with his family, his raft drifted out from shore and then flipped over. He scrambled to try to get back on, but kept falling back into the sea. He never relished the water again. 'We connected' As the plane glided silently through the air, Ben peeked out the window every once in a while. He could see they were headed straight toward water. ""Just make it quick so I don't have to suffer,"" he thought. The Airbus splashed into the frigid waters of the Hudson River. The clank of seatbelts unbuckling rattled inside the plane. Water lapped at Laura's leather boots. She grabbed her wallet and her cell phone with a GPS tracking device. It'll be easier for rescuers to find my body and identify me, she thought. She exited to the left and onto a wing. While bobbing up and down there, she called her father. ""Dad, this is Laura. I've been in a plane crash."" When things calmed down and she knew she would be rescued, she found comic relief in what brought the plane down. ""You do realize my fear of birds is justified,"" she told her parents. ""OK, we'll give you that one,"" they responded. Inside the plane, a bottleneck of passengers blocked some exits. A flight attendant in first class waved passengers to the front. Ben climbed over the seats. At the door, he looked out and saw water all around. Clutching tight to his seat cushion, he jumped into a raft. With survivors packed in like sardines, he worried the raft might tip. Later, safe on shore, Ben's colleagues who were also on the flight saluted life and told him: You know what we'd be doing tonight if we were single! Ben thought about the woman with the long legs and curly hair. He wondered what happened to her. From Facebook friends to dating . A bottle of Maker's Mark bourbon helped ease Ben's charter flight home to Charlotte that night. In the media blitz that followed, Laura noticed Ben for the first time on television. They became Facebook friends. Flight 1549 survivors -- whose stories were compiled in the book ""Miracle on the Hudson,"" published late last year -- formed support groups. They considered ""Sully"" their hero, each other family. Six months after the crash, when about 20 survivors and their families gathered at a home near Charlotte, Ben and Laura met in person for the first time. ""I was checking you out on the plane,"" he told her. They went clubbing with a third survivor that night. Then the two stayed up talking until 6 in the morning. They shared secrets, their views on life's opportunities. ""We connected,"" Laura says. They took it slow at first. Neither was looking for a relationship. ""We were family,"" Ben says, ""and we didn't want to ruin that aspect of it."" Eventually, sparks lit. Despite their bond, the last year has had its difficulties. They wonder why they survived when, a month later, all 50 people aboard a Buffalo commuter jet died. Both have sought counseling. They take anti-anxiety medication to ease air travel. Ben never sits at a window seat. Weeks after the flight, the airline returned salvaged personal belongings to survivors. Laura received a white envelope, labeled with a number. Inside was her waterlogged Glamour magazine. ""It put me back in that seat,"" she says, tears in her eyes. Four other boxes of returned items sit unopened in a spare bedroom. She doesn't know whether to throw them out or save them. ""Things in there must not be that important,"" she says. ""All the priorities were reset after January 15."" Her relationship with Ben, she says, is another ""positive outcome"" from that day. ""We kind of pick each other up if we start to slip,"" Ben says. ""What's better than smiling and laughing and love?"" They're speaking about their relationship, Laura says, because too much news dwells on the negative. Their message is the opposite. ""Think about how you want to write today's page,"" Ben says. ""Live, laugh, love and dance like tomorrow's not guaranteed.""","Laura Zych and Ben Bostic had never met before the ""Miracle on Hudson"" flight .

"(CNN) -- Africa's most active volcano, Mount Nyamuragira in the Democratic Republic of Congo, erupted early Saturday, spewing lava off its southern flank, the Congolese Wildlife Authority reported. Rangers in Virunga National Park reported hearing a loud explosion at 3:45 a.m. and then seeing lava flowing from the crater of the 10,033-foot volcano. ""I first thought (it) was the sound of war. I thought there was fighting again near our park station,"" said Innocent Mburanumwe, warden for the southern sector of Virunga National Park. ""Then I saw the mountain was on fire with sparks flying. We could see that we were not in immediate danger here at Rumangabo, but there are many people who live to the south of the volcano, where the lava is heading as I speak."" Nyamuragira is 15 miles (25 kilometers) north of the city of Goma and its 600,000 residents, but Mburanumwe said in a blog posting that lava flows from the mountain were unlikely to threaten human populations. Lava flows from another park volcano, Nyiragongo, destroyed parts of Goma in 2002. The wildlife authority said the Nyamuragira eruption was likely to destroy habitat for 40 chimpanzees on the volcano's lower slopes. Virunga National Park is also home to 200 endangered mountain gorillas, but they live on the slopes of the Mikena volcano to the east of Nyamuragira. The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History calls Nyamuragira the continent's most active volcano, with 42 eruptions since 1885. Its most recent eruption ended in December 2006.","Lava flowing down southern flank of Mount Nyamuragira, park rangers report .
